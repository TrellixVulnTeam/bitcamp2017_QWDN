Zobel, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                        Lynch, Chief Judge,\n                 Selya and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Stephen Schultz, with whom Engel & Schultz was on brief, for\nappellants.\n     Brian A.

The plaintiffs in this case complain\n\nthat    the    prices   for   gasoline    on    Martha's    Vineyard    have   been\n\nartificially high due both to an illegal price-fixing conspiracy\n\namong four of the island's nine gas stations and to unconscionable\n\nprice-gouging in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in\n\n2005.     As to the antitrust claims, the stations agree for the\n\npurposes of summary judgment that there is evidence of parallel\n\npricing but say that is not illegal absent an agreement to fix\n\nprices.       The district court granted summary judgment to defendants\n\non both of plaintiffs' claims, which were brought under § 1 of the\n\nSherman Antitrust Act and a price-gouging regulation under Mass.\n\nGen. Laws ch. 93A.       We affirm, discussing the law on \"agreements,\"\n\nas opposed to \"conscious parallelism,\" under the Sherman Act, and\n\nassessing the defendants' post-hurricane pricing patterns under the\n\nstate price-gouging rule.\n\n                              I. Standard of Review\n\n               We discuss separately the price-fixing and price-gouging\n\nclaims.       The standard of review for each is the same.              We review\n\nthe district court's grant of summary judgment de novo, taking all\n\nfacts    and    reasonable     inferences      therefrom    in   the   light   most\n\nfavorable to plaintiffs, the nonmoving parties, and affirming only\n\nif there are no genuine issues of material fact and defendants are\n\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.                   See Cortes-Rivera v.\n\nDep't of Corr. and Rehab., 626 F.3d 21, 26 (1st Cir. 2010).\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\f                 II. Sherman Act Price-Fixing Claim\n\n            An understanding of the legal structure of a price-fixing\n\nclaim under the Sherman Antitrust Act gives context to the facts\n\nrelied on by plaintiffs on summary judgment.\n\nA.          Legal and Economic Background\n\n            Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act prohibits \"[e]very\n\ncontract,   combination   in   the   form   of   trust   or   otherwise,   or\n\nconspiracy, in restraint of trade.\"         15 U.S.C. § 1.1     In general,\n\npractices challenged under the Sherman Act are struck down only if\n\nthey are unreasonable and anticompetitive, but agreements to fix\n\nprices are \"so plainly anticompetitive\" that they are per se\n\nillegal.    Texaco Inc. v. Dagher, 547 U.S. 1, 5 (2006) (quoting\n\nNat'l Soc'y of Prof'l Eng'rs v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 692\n\n(1978)).\n\n            Section 1 by its plain terms reaches only \"agreements\"--\n\nwhether tacit or express.       Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S.\n\n544, 553 (2007).   It does not reach independent decisions, even if\n\nthey lead to the same anticompetitive result as an actual agreement\n\namong market actors.2     15 U.S.C. § 1; Am. Needle, Inc. v. Nat'l\n\n\n     1\n          15 U.S.C. § 1 criminalizes anticompetitive agreements and\nspecifies criminal penalties, and 15 U.S.C. § 15(a) provides a\nprivate right of action with treble damages for any violation of\nthe antitrust laws.\n     2\n          Section 2 of the Sherman Act does reach independent\nbehavior, but only where a person \"shall monopolize, or attempt to\nmonopolize,\" a market. 15 U.S.C. § 2. That section is not invoked\nhere.\n\n                                     -3-\n\fFootball League, 130 S. Ct. 2201, 2208-09 & n.2 (2010); Clamp-All\n\nCorp. v. Cast Iron Soil Pipe Inst., 851 F.2d 478, 484 (1st Cir.\n\n1988).   The statute \"does not require sellers to compete; it just\n\nforbids their agreeing or conspiring not to compete.\"    In re Text\n\nMessaging Antitrust Litig., No. 10-8037, 2010 WL 5367383, at *4\n\n(7th Cir. Dec. 29, 2010) (Posner, J.).\n\n          This limit means that bare \"conscious parallelism\" is\n\n\"not in itself unlawful.\"   Brooke Grp. Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson\n\nTobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 227 (1993).   Conscious parallelism3 is\n\na phenomenon of oligopolistic markets4 in which firms \"might in\n\n\n\n     3\n          Conscious parallelism has also been called \"tacit\ncollusion\" or \"oligopolistic price coordination.\" See Brooke Grp.\nLtd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 227 (1993).\nDefendants' assertion that \"[a] merely tacit agreement is not an\nantitrust violation\" conflates the concepts of \"tacit collusion,\"\nreferring to bare conscious parallelism, and \"tacit agreement,\"\nwhich can be reached under § 1, and which plaintiffs allege is in\nplay in this case. See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544,\n553 (2007) (distinguishing mere conscious parallelism from \"an\nagreement, tacit or express\") (quoting Theatre Enters., Inc. v.\nParamount Film Distrib. Corp., 346 U.S. 537, 540 (1954) (internal\nquotation mark omitted)).\n     4\n          \"An oligopoly market is one in which a few relatively\nlarge sellers account for the bulk of the output.\"      2B Areeda,\nHovenkamp, & Solow, Antitrust Law ¶ 404a, at 9 (3d ed. 2007). By\ncontrast to a competitive market, in which no single producer has\nthe power to affect the market price, in an oligopolistic market\neach of the major sellers can affect the market price by changing\nits output. By contrast to a monopolized market, \"no one firm can\nunilaterally determine market price by varying its output\" because\nrivals are large enough to affect the market price by doing the\nsame. Id. at 10. As a result, \"the distinctive characteristic of\noligopoly is recognized interdependence among the leading firms:\nthe profit-maximizing choice of price and output for one depends on\nthe choices made by others.\" Id.\n\n                                -4-\n\feffect share monopoly power, setting their prices at a profit-\n\nmaximizing, supracompetitive level by recognizing their shared\n\neconomic interests and their interdependence with respect to price\n\nand output decisions.\" Id. Each producer may independently decide\n\nthat it can maximize its profits by matching one or more other\n\nproducers' price, on the hope that the market will be able to\n\nmaintain high prices if the producers do not undercut one another.\n\n          A tacit agreement--one in which only the conspirators'\n\nactions, and not any express communications, indicate the existence\n\nof an agreement--is distinguished from mere conscious parallelism\n\nby \"uniform behavior among competitors, preceded by conversations\n\nimplying that later uniformity might prove desirable or accompanied\n\nby other conduct that in context suggests that each competitor\n\nfailed to make an independent decision.\"        Brown v. Pro Football,\n\nInc., 518 U.S. 231, 241 (1996) (internal citations omitted).          In\n\nthe seminal case, Interstate Circuit v. United States, 306 U.S. 208\n\n(1939), the Supreme Court found a tacit agreement where a dominant\n\nmovie theater company sent a letter openly addressed to all eight\n\nmajor national film distributors stating that it would show a\n\ndistributor's   films   only   if   the   distributor   imposed   certain\n\nrestrictions on later runs of the films in secondary theaters. Id.\n\nat 215-19. The Supreme Court held that the distributors, who never\n\ncommunicated directly with one another, nonetheless had entered\n\ninto a tacit agreement with one another by acting in accordance\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fwith the letter's demands, because the letter made it clear that\n\nall eight had received the letter, the economic context made it\n\nclear that all eight needed to act uniformly or all would lose\n\nbusiness, and all eight did in fact impose the conditions.      Id. at\n\n222.   The opinion has been criticized, see, e.g., 3B Areeda &\n\nHovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 810b, at 470-71 (3d ed. 2008), but the\n\nSupreme Court has recently reiterated that tacit agreements are\n\nstill agreements under the Sherman Act, Twombly, 550 U.S. at 553.\n\n           Some markets are particularly conducive to maintaining\n\nconsciously parallel pricing without the need for agreement among\n\nthe producers.      \"Tacit coordination is facilitated by a stable\n\nmarket environment, fungible products, and a small number of\n\nvariables upon which the firms seeking to coordinate their pricing\n\nmay focus.\"   Brooke Grp., 509 U.S. at 238.      Such coordination is\n\nalso easier to maintain when these fungible goods \"are repeatedly\n\nsold in market transactions that are immediately known in every\n\ndetail by customers and rivals.\"    6 Areeda & Hovenkamp, Antitrust\n\nLaw ¶ 1430b, at 225 (3d ed. 2010).      A geographically constrained\n\ngasoline   market     with   publicly   posted   prices   has   these\n\ncharacteristics.\n\n           Because supracompetitive prices--prices above what they\n\nwould be in a perfectly competitive market--can result from both\n\nlawful conscious parallelism and an unlawful agreement to fix\n\nprices, antitrust doctrine has developed evidentiary standards to\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fminimize the risk that legal conduct will be chilled or punished.\n\nMonsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Serv. Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 763 (1984).\n\nPlaintiffs must establish that it is plausible that defendants are\n\nengaged in more than mere conscious parallelism, by pleading and\n\nlater producing evidence pointing toward conspiracy, sometimes\n\nreferred to as \"plus factors.\"     See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556 & n.4\n\n(requiring antitrust plaintiffs to plead behavior more consistent\n\nwith agreement than with independence); In re Flat Glass Antitrust\n\nLitig., 385 F.3d 350, 360 (3d Cir. 2004) (explaining that \"plus\n\nfactors\" are \"proxies for direct evidence of an agreement\").\n\n           In addition, the Supreme Court has \"limit[ed] the range\n\nof permissible inferences from ambiguous evidence in a § 1 case,\"\n\nholding that, at summary judgment, \"conduct as consistent with\n\npermissible   competition   as   with    illegal   conspiracy    does   not,\n\nstanding alone, support an inference of antitrust conspiracy\" that\n\nallows plaintiffs' evidence to reach a jury.            Matsushita Elec.\n\nIndus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 588 (1986).\n\n           In order to survive summary judgment, plaintiffs must\n\nproduce   direct   or   circumstantial    evidence   that   is   not    only\n\nconsistent with conspiracy, but \"tends to exclude the possibility\n\nof independent action.\"     Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 764.      Such evidence\n\ncould show \"parallel behavior that would probably not result from\n\nchance, coincidence, independent responses to common stimuli, or\n\nmere interdependence unaided by an advance understanding among the\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fparties.\"     Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557 n.4 (quoting 6 Areeda &\n\nHovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 1425, at 167 (2d ed. 2003)) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n            These   special    rules    apply      to   claims    of   horizontal\n\nconspiracies such as this claim of price-fixing.5                See Twombly, 550\n\nU.S. at 554 (stating that a § 1 plaintiff must meet the Monsanto\n\nand Matsushita requirements, and not distinguishing among types of\n\n§ 1 claims); see also, e.g., Flat Glass, 385 F.3d at 357-59\n\n(applying Matsushita in price-fixing case, because lawful conscious\n\nparallelism can lead to same economic result as conspiracy);\n\nBlomkest Fertilizer, Inc. v. Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan, 203 F.3d\n\n1028, 1032 (8th Cir. 2000) (stating that circuit applies Matsushita\n\n\"broadly, and in both horizontal and vertical price fixing cases\").\n\nThis is the common understanding and plaintiffs do not disagree.\n\nB.          Factual and Procedural Background\n\n            The underlying facts of the case, including the district\n\ncourt's description of the retail gasoline market on Martha's\n\nVineyard, are undisputed.\n\n            Plaintiffs   are    summer       and   year-round      residents   of\n\nMartha's Vineyard and an island real estate agency.                    Defendants\n\noperate four of the nine gas stations on Martha's Vineyard.                    In\n\n\n     5\n          In Euromodas, Inc. v. Zanella, Ltd., 368 F.3d 11, 17 &\nn.5 (1st Cir. 2004), we applied these rules to vertical\nconspiracies and reserved the question of whether they applied to\nhorizontal conspiracies, an issue we now resolve by applying these\nrules to horizontal conspiracies as well.\n\n                                       -8-\n\fEdgartown, individual defendant Francis Paciello owns the Edgartown\n\nMobil station. The defendant corporation Depot Corner, Inc., which\n\nis wholly owned by Paciello, owns the Depot Corner station, also in\n\nEdgartown.   In Vineyard Haven, about seven miles northwest of\n\nEdgartown, defendant corporation Drake/Kenyon (Drake)6 owns the\n\nXtraMart Citgo station in Vineyard Haven and also supplies gasoline\n\nto the Edgartown stations at wholesale. Defendant corporation R.M.\n\nPacker, also in Vineyard Haven, owns the Tisbury Shell gas station;\n\nR.M. Packer is owned by the individuals Ralph Packer and his wife.\n\n          Of the other five gas stations on the island, two are in\n\nOak Bluffs, about three miles from Vineyard Haven, one is in\n\nEdgartown, and two are on the western part of the island in West\n\nTisbury and Chilmark.\n\n          The defendants' prices exceeded prices at gas stations on\n\nCape Cod by an average of fifty-six cents per gallon during a five\n\nyear period beginning on August 1, 2003, according to calculations\n\nperformed by plaintiffs' expert and cited by the district court.\n\nTwenty-one cents of that difference is attributable to the higher\n\ncosts of transporting gas to the island than to the mainland Cape.\n\n          The retail gasoline market on Martha's Vineyard has\n\nfeatures that make it susceptible to efforts by gas stations to\n\nsustain supracompetitive prices.   These features would facilitate\n\n\n     6\n          Drake and Kenyon were once separate corporations, and\nwere each named as defendants when the suit was originally filed in\n2007. They had merged in 2004.\n\n                               -9-\n\fboth conspiratorial pricing and merely interdependant parallel\n\npricing for several reasons.   See 2B Areeda, Hovenkamp, & Solow,\n\nsupra, ¶ 404, at 9-20.\n\n          First, would-be competitors attracted to the market by\n\nhigh profit margins face a regulatory barrier to entry: they need\n\npermission from the Martha's Vineyard Commission.   The Commission\n\nhas denied all petitions to open new gas stations since 1997.\n\nThis, along with their location on a relatively small island,\n\ninsulates the current stations from competition.\n\n          Second, customer demand for gasoline on an island is\n\ninelastic, meaning customers will not buy much less gas when prices\n\nrise, because they cannot choose to drive farther away to get\n\ncheaper gas.   Gasoline in general is a nondurable good, so that\n\ncustomers have to buy it frequently and are not likely to simply\n\nstay out of the market until prices drop.    This is particularly\n\ntrue for customers who are summer residents and are in the market\n\nfor only limited periods of time.\n\n          Third, gasoline is a homogeneous good, so consumers\n\ndecide where to buy it based mostly on price and convenience,\n\nleading competing gas stations to prominently post prices.    This\n\nposting also lets competitors know and respond in real time to one\n\nanother's prices, allowing them to catch price \"cheaters\" and to\n\nfollow price \"leaders.\"    See id. ¶ 404b3, at 14-15 (describing\n\ncheating); 6 Areeda & Hovenkamp, supra, ¶ 1430d, at 226 (describing\n\n\n                               -10-\n\fleading); see also United States v. Heffernan, 43 F.3d 1144, 1149\n\n(7th Cir. 1994) (describing catching price cheaters).             Since there\n\nare only nine gas stations on the entire island, each station can\n\neasily monitor and respond to the prices of the others.               If one\n\nstation drops its price in order to attract more business, the\n\nothers can quickly drop their prices in response.                The original\n\n\"cheater\" benefits very little from undercutting its competitors'\n\nprices,   because   when   any   one   of   them   drops   its    prices   the\n\ncompetitors can match the price before many customers respond to\n\nthe incentive.   And all of the stations suffer a decrease in profit\n\nmargin.\n\n           Conversely, a station acting as a price \"leader\" risks\n\nlittle by raising its price under such market conditions.               Other\n\nstations are likely to follow, given the possibility of higher\n\nprices and profit margins for all.             If for some reason the\n\ncompetitors do not follow the increases, the leader can easily drop\n\nits price again to match the other stations so quickly that few\n\ncustomers are lost to lower-priced competition.              Knowing these\n\nfeatures of the market, each gas station owner is likely to reach\n\nits own independent conclusion that its best interests involve\n\nkeeping prices high, including following price changes by a price\n\n\"leader\" (if one emerges), in confidence that the other station\n\nowners will reach the same independent conclusion.           Here there is\n\nno evidence or suggestion that the business risk to any station on\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fMartha's Vineyard of raising its prices was so great as to require\n\ncommunication among stations before any one of them would venture\n\nit.\n\n              Plaintiffs, angered by what they saw as unjustifiably\n\nhigh prices at the pump, brought suit in Massachusetts Superior\n\nCourt on August 2, 2007 alleging that defendants had conspired to\n\nfix retail gas prices since at least December 31, 1999. Defendants\n\nremoved the case to federal court on August 28, 2007,7 after which\n\nplaintiffs      filed   an   amended    complaint,   substituting      Sherman\n\nAntitrust       Act   price-fixing     allegations   for     their    original\n\nMassachusetts Antitrust Act allegations.         Due to the Sherman Act's\n\nfour-year statute of limitations, 15 U.S.C. § 15b, the district\n\ncourt       limited   plaintiffs'    price-fixing    claim    to     violations\n\noccurring on or after August 2, 2003.          The district court allowed\n\ndiscovery, but denied the parties' joint requests for discovery of\n\ndetailed sales and financial data from other Martha's Vineyard gas\n\nstations not named in the suit.         Following a June 24, 2009, hearing\n\non defendants' motions for summary judgment, the district court\n\ngranted defendants' motions on January 6, 2010.\n\n              Although our review is de novo, we describe the district\n\ncourt's thoughtful analysis. The district court reasoned that most\n\n\n\n        7\n          Plaintiffs brought their suit as a class action, and\ndefendants removed it to federal court pursuant to the Class Action\nFairness Act's minimal diversity requirements.       See 28 U.S.C.\n§§ 1332(d), 1453.\n\n                                       -12-\n\fof the evidence the plaintiffs proffered was no more consistent\n\nwith conspiracy than with independent choices to engage in parallel\n\npricing.   The district court found other evidence not sufficiently\n\nprobative of conspiracy.    First, the district court found that\n\nDrake's employment of a consultant to lobby the Martha's Vineyard\n\nCommission to deny petitions for new gas stations was \"conduct that\n\nwould be expected even in a competitive gasoline retail market.\"\n\nWhite v. R.M. Packer Co., No. 07-11601, slip op. at 6 n.5 (D. Mass.\n\nJan. 6, 2010). Second, the district court found too attenuated the\n\nevidence that two of the defendants communicated with one another\n\nabout prices in 1999 because the communications concerned the\n\nwholesale, rather than retail, market and occurred years before the\n\nperiod covered by the limitations period. The district court found\n\nit troubling that an unusually generous loan from Drake to Paciello\n\nmay have provided Paciello with an incentive to conspire with\n\nDrake, but held that this was not enough to permit a reasonable\n\njury to find an agreement to fix prices.\n\nC.         Merits of   Plaintiffs'   Appeal   from   Entry   of   Summary\n           Judgment\n\n           Plaintiffs argue that the district court erred by (1)\n\napplying the wrong legal standard, (2) considering their evidence\n\nof plus factors piecemeal rather than as a whole, and (3) ignoring\n\ntheir expert evidence.\n\n           First, plaintiffs argue that the district court, despite\n\ncorrectly stating the legal standard to which it held plaintiffs'\n\n                                -13-\n\fevidence, proceeded in fact as if plaintiffs are required to\n\n\"exclude,\" rather than \"tend to exclude,\" the possibility of\n\nindependent action.    See Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 588.       Having\n\nreviewed the entire record, we disagree.    Nothing in the district\n\ncourt's opinion suggests that the court required plaintiffs to\n\nproduce direct evidence of conspiracy as plaintiffs claim.8\n\n          Plaintiffs also argue that defendants' concession for\n\nsummary judgment purposes that there has been parallel pricing\n\n\"gets plaintiffs close to defeating summary judgment\" because of\n\nthe statement in Twombly that \"[a]n allegation of parallel conduct\n\n. . . gets [a] complaint close to stating a claim\" for purposes of\n\nsurviving an initial motion to dismiss.    Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557\n\n(emphasis added).   As a statement of the law at summary judgment,\n\nplaintiffs are flatly wrong.    Mere parallelism, whether stipulated\n\nor proven, does not even create a prima facie conspiracy case.   See\n\nBrooke Grp., 509 U.S. at 227.\n\n          Much of the evidence plaintiffs offer as \"plus factors,\"\n\neven when viewed in the light most favorable to them, does no more\n\nthan corroborate that the Martha's Vineyard gasoline market is an\n\noligopolistic market which is highly conducive to parallel pricing.\n\n\n     8\n          Plaintiffs argue that the district court's use, at one\npoint in the opinion, of the word \"exclude\" without the modifying\nphrase \"tends to\" shows that the court required them to produce\ndirect evidence of conspiracy, rather than only circumstantial\nevidence tending to exclude the possibility of independent action.\nIt is clear from the court's opinion that it did not require any\nparticular category of evidence.\n\n                                 -14-\n\fThe evidence does nothing to explain whether the parallel pricing\n\nwas    achieved          by    agreement       or     mere   interdependent     decisions.\n\nPlaintiffs' remaining evidence does not \"'tend[] to exclude the\n\npossibility' that the alleged conspirators acted independently,\"\n\nand    so       is   not      enough    to    permit    a    reasonable   inference   that\n\ndefendants' behavior was more than mere conscious parallelism.\n\nMatsushita, 475 U.S. at 588 (quoting Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 764).\n\nThe report of plaintiffs' expert witness, Boston College economics\n\nprofessor Frank Gollop, does not alter the conclusion.                          The report\n\nwas adequately considered by the district court.                              It does not\n\nundermine, and in fact is consistent with, our conclusion and that\n\nof the district court.\n\n                 Plaintiffs draw their list of plus factors from the\n\nauthorities mentioned in the Supreme Court's Twombly opinion as\n\nproviding \"examples of parallel conduct allegations that would\n\nstate       a    §   1     claim\"      under    the    heightened     pleading    standard\n\nestablished in that case.                    Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557 n.4 (citing 6\n\nAreeda & Hovenkamp, supra, ¶ 1425, at 167-85; Michael D. Blechman,\n\nConscious Parallelism, Signalling and Facilitation Devices, 24\n\nN.Y.L. Sch. L. Rev. 881, 899 (1979)).                         Plaintiffs also invoke a\n\nlist    of       plus      factors      described       in   Judge   Posner's    antitrust\n\nmonograph.           See Richard Posner, Antitrust Law 69-93 (2d ed. 2001).\n\nYet as these sources themselves emphasize, many so-called plus\n\nfactors simply \"demonstrate that a given market is chronically non-\n\n\n                                                -15-\n\fcompetitive,\" without helping to explain whether agreement or\n\nconscious parallelism is the cause.        Blechman, supra, at 898; see\n\nalso 6 Areeda & Hovenkamp, supra, ¶ 1434, at 263-69 (explaining\n\nthat   \"plus   factors\"   which   merely   restate    interdependence       are\n\nprerequisites to an inference of agreement but are not enough);\n\nPosner, supra, at 69-79 (listing seventeen factors as useful in\n\nidentifying markets conducive to conscious parallelism).                  To be\n\nsure, providing this evidence demonstrates that plaintiffs' claim\n\nis not economically implausible.       See Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587\n\n(\"[I]f the claim is one that simply makes no economic sense[,\n\nplaintiffs] must come forward with more persuasive evidence to\n\nsupport their claim than would otherwise be necessary.\"). But such\n\nevidence does not by itself suggest that defendants' conduct shows\n\nagreement.     See Flat Glass, 385 F.3d at 360-61; see also In re High\n\nFructose Corn Syrup Antitrust Litig., 295 F.3d 651, 658 (7th Cir.\n\n2002) (Posner, J.) (distinguishing \"evidence of noncompetitive\n\nbehavior\" from \"evidence that the structure of the market was\n\nconducive to such behavior\").\n\n            We have considered the totality of plaintiffs' evidence,\n\nas did the district court, and discuss the inadequacy of the parts\n\nas well as of the whole.      Six of plaintiffs' nine plus factors show\n\nnothing more than that the gasoline market on Martha's Vineyard is\n\nconducive    to   conscious   parallelism.    We     begin   with   two    that\n\ndescribe defendants' pricing behavior. First, during three periods\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\fin 2004 and 2005 the defendants, in parallel, held prices steady or\n\nraised them while the cost of gasoline at wholesale declined.\n\nSecond, defendants have enjoyed what plaintiffs call \"abnormal\n\nprofits.\" It is true, as plaintiffs state, that changes in pricing\n\npatterns   and    profit     levels   may   be    useful   in    identifying    the\n\nbeginning of a conspiracy, immediately after which conspirators may\n\nsuccessfully raise prices without reference to costs.                 See Posner,\n\nsupra, at 88, 90; see also Text Messaging, 2010 WL 5367383, at *5\n\n(stating   that    in   a   competitive     market      \"falling   costs    .   .   .\n\nmotivat[e a seller], in the absence of agreement, to reduce his\n\nprice slightly in order to take business from his competitors\").\n\n            However, these pricing behaviors do not function as \"plus\n\nfactors\" when they are stable over time, because that factual\n\ncontext    undermines       any   inference      that   the     pricing    behavior\n\nrepresents a sudden shift marking the beginning of a price-fixing\n\nconspiracy.       Here, plaintiffs allege a price-fixing conspiracy\n\ndating back \"at least as early as December 31, 1999\"; there is no\n\nsuggestion that defendants' behavior changed in 2004, in 2005, or\n\nat any other relevant time. In this factual context, evidence that\n\ndefendants set supracompetitive prices that did not decline when\n\ntheir costs declined shows no more than that they made their\n\npricing decisions in an oligopolistic, rather than competitive,\n\nmarket.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\f             Other evidence also undermines plaintiffs' arguments\n\nabout defendants' pricing behaviors. Plaintiffs' own expert stated\n\nthat \"[n]o unambiguous conclusion . . . can be gleaned from\n\n[defendants'] pattern of parallel pricing,\" and that he could \"draw\n\nno   behavioral     conclusion\"     from    the     divergence    between     the\n\ndefendants' declining costs and retail prices, since it could \"be\n\nthe result of a supra-competitive price umbrella.\"                Further, the\n\nexpert did not explain whether in his opinion such an \"umbrella\"\n\nwould even require agreement.            Similarly ambiguous is deposition\n\ntestimony as to three of the four stations, by the principals of\n\ndefendants Drake and Depot Corner, Inc., that they did not know\n\nwhat margin over cost they needed to charge to turn a profit.\n\nPlaintiffs argue that without a price agreement such ignorance\n\nwould   be   \"suicidal,\"    but   the     testimony    equally   supports    the\n\ninference that stations' pricing decisions in this market are not\n\nbased, as they would be in a competitive market, on cost, but\n\nrather on the actions and expected actions of other stations.\n\n             A   third   plus   factor    offered     by   plaintiffs   is   that\n\ndefendants had \"motive to conspire\" because cooperating with one\n\nanother could allow them to earn supracompetitive profits.               Taking\n\nas a given that all of the defendants had motive to conspire with\n\none another to earn high profits, all such a motive shows is that\n\nthe defendants could reasonably expect to earn higher profits by\n\nkeeping prices at a supracompetitive level through parallel pricing\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\fpractices. Matsushita states that evidence showing defendants have\n\n\"a plausible reason to conspire\" does not create a triable issue as\n\nto whether there was a conspiracy.                 Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 596-97\n\n&   n.21;      6    Areeda      &   Hovenkamp,     supra,    ¶   1434(c)(1),      at    269\n\n(\"Motivation is thus synonymous with interdependence and therefore\n\nadds nothing to it.\").              We take up later the issue of whether a $2\n\nmillion     loan      at    a   below-market       interest      rate   from    Drake    to\n\nPaciello, when Paciello could not obtain a loan from other lenders,\n\ngave Paciello motive to \"do Drake's bidding regarding keeping up\n\ngas prices\" as plaintiffs claim.\n\n               Three other plus factors plaintiffs allege are that the\n\nMartha's Vineyard retail gasoline market (1) is insulated by high\n\nbarriers to entry, thanks to the Martha's Vineyard Commission's\n\ndemonstrated gatekeeping power, (2) faces highly inelastic demand\n\nfor gasoline, and (3) is marked by stable relative market shares\n\nover time among the four defendants.                  High barriers to entry and\n\ninelastic          demand    are    two   hallmarks    of     oligopolistic       markets\n\nsusceptible to successful parallel pricing practices, but neither\n\nhelps     to       distinguish       between     agreement       and    mere    conscious\n\nparallelism as the root cause of those practices.                              \"[W]ithout\n\nbarriers to entry it would presumably be impossible to maintain\n\nsupracompetitive prices . . . .\"                     Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 591\n\nn.15; see also Williamson Oil Co. v. Philip Morris USA, 346 F.3d\n\n1287, 1317 (11th Cir. 2003) (describing high barriers to entry and\n\n\n                                            -19-\n\finelastic demand as two indicia of oligopoly).                 And while stable\n\nmarket shares over time may suggest in some factual contexts that\n\nthe firms \"eliminated competition[] among themselves,\" Posner,\n\nsupra, at 79, it is also likely that conscious parallelism would be\n\nsufficient to maintain stable relative market shares in a stable\n\nmarket for a basic commodity protected from new entry.                         The\n\ndistrict     court       specifically          cited    plaintiffs'      expert's\n\nacknowledgment      that       the   \"nearly    constant     market   shares   are\n\nconsistent   with       both    cooperative     and    non-cooperative    pricing\n\nbehavior.\"   See White, slip op. at 6.\n\n           Plaintiffs' seventh factor is that variations in price\n\nfrom region to region may indicate collusion.                This may be true on\n\nsome facts. See Posner, supra, at 87.                   But plaintiffs err in\n\npointing to the difference in gas prices between Cape Cod and\n\nMartha's Vineyard.         Even discounting the higher transportation\n\ncosts of getting fuel to the island gas stations, we have already\n\ndiscussed a number of lawful reasons why the island stations are\n\nlikely to be able to maintain the rest of the variation in price\n\nwithout agreement.\n\n           Plaintiffs' eighth purported plus factor is that Drake's\n\nemployment   of     a    consultant      to    lobby   the    Martha's   Vineyard\n\nCommission to deny a petition for a new gas station on the island\n\nproves that Drake \"was willing to act secretly to influence gas\n\nprices.\"     Drake's unilateral retention of a consultant was a\n\n\n                                        -20-\n\flegitimate exercise of its right to petition.                    There is no claim\n\nthat   the   consultant      or    the    Commission     acted     illegally.      In\n\naddition,      this   was    entirely      economically      rational     behavior,\n\nwhatever the Commission decided.                 Indeed, these actions are well\n\nwithin those actions which the Supreme Court sought to protect from\n\nchilling effects.        See Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 763.\n\n             Other pieces of evidence require further examination and\n\nwe consider them the strongest evidence plaintiffs have advanced.\n\nPlaintiffs produced some evidence that two of the defendants'\n\nprincipals     communicated        with    one     another   and    may   have   been\n\nuntruthful about the communication.                 This fits with a different\n\ntype of plus factor: \"traditional\" conspiracy evidence of the type\n\nthat   helps    to    distinguish        between    conscious      parallelism    and\n\ncollusion and that is necessary to an inference of agreement. Flat\n\nGlass, 385 F.3d at 362; 6 Areeda & Hovenkamp, supra, ¶ 1434b, at\n\n267. This need not be direct evidence; circumstantial evidence can\n\nsuffice to establish an antitrust conspiracy.                 Monsanto, 465 U.S.\n\nat 764.\n\n             Two witnesses recalled meetings held ten years earlier,\n\nin   December    1999,      with   Jim    Ahern     of   defendant    Drake      about\n\ncontracting with Drake to be the wholesale gas supplier for a new\n\ngas station they were trying to open on the island.                   At the first\n\nmeeting, the two described a ten-cent retail price discount for\n\nyear-round Vineyard residents that they proposed to offer in order\n\n\n                                          -21-\n\fto convince the Martha's Vineyard Commission to approve their\n\npermit.   Ahern replied that he would not give year-round residents\n\na discount.9    Then, referring to Ralph Packer, whose company R.M.\n\nPacker was the owner of Tisbury Shell, Ahern made the point that\n\nbusinesses     on   the   Vineyard   were   also   not   inclined   to   give\n\ndiscounts, saying, \"Your boy Ralph Packer, an island boy, is not\n\ncutting people any slack, and I'm not going to either.\"             It is not\n\nclear from the record whether Ahern was speaking as a wholesaler or\n\nretailer in refusing to contemplate a discount, since both his\n\ncompany and Ralph Packer's company, R.M. Packer, played both\n\nwholesaler and retailer roles on Martha's Vineyard.            R.M. Packer\n\nsupplied other stations on the island that are not defendants.\n\nDrake supplied the two defendant stations owned by Paciello, but\n\nalso was a wholesaler to a number of stations elsewhere on the East\n\nCoast.\n\n           At the second meeting, during a discussion between the\n\ntwo witnesses and Ahern about the discount, when the subject of\n\nRalph Packer arose Ahern said, \"You know we talk.\"              Ahern then\n\ncalled on speakerphone a person whom Ahern said was Packer.                It\n\nappeared to the witnesses that the call's recipient recognized\n\nAhern's voice without Ahern identifying himself.             We assume, in\n\nplaintiffs' favor, that the call recipient was Packer.                   Ahern\n\n\n     9\n          The witnesses observed that Ahern seemed offended by the\nidea that such a discount would be a necessary condition to secure\na permit. He did not feel it was right.\n\n                                     -22-\n\fcasually stated to Packer that he was just checking in, and hung up\n\nafter a friendly, general conversation of under five minutes.\n\nAhern and Packer did not discuss the witnesses' desire to open a\n\nstation, pricing or other business.        One witness said he thought\n\nAhern made the call \"to demonstrate . . . that it didn't really\n\nmatter who we chose as a distributor, we'd have the same wholesale\n\nprice.\"   The witness also said that after this conversation, Ahern\n\ntold them, \"we all work together,\" and said, \"I talk to Packer\n\nfrequently.\"\n\n           Yet Ahern said in a 2009 deposition that he did not\n\nrecall talking to Ralph Packer on the phone and only had one\n\nbusiness meeting with him.     Packer, in a 2008 deposition, said he\n\nmet once with Ahern about wholesale supply about fifteen years\n\nearlier and had no phone conversations with him.       In context, even\n\nif Ahern's and Packer's denials that they spoke over the phone were\n\nuntrue, Ahern's actions and statements demonstrated at most a\n\nwholesaler's   attempt   to   show   his   leverage   over   a    potential\n\nwholesale customer, and are vague, ambiguous, and non-probative\n\nwith regard to retail pricing practices.\n\n           There was more evidence about that meeting.           One of the\n\nwitnesses seeking permission to open a new station stated his view\n\nthat if the new station were to offer gasoline at a lower price,\n\nthere would be a chain reaction and the other stations would also\n\nlower their prices. In response to conjecture on what would happen\n\n\n                                 -23-\n\fif the two Paciello stations supplied by Ahern's company, Drake,\n\nstarted dropping their prices, Ahern replied, \"if they start\n\nmucking around with prices one or two delivery trucks a week might\n\nnot make it on the boat and they'll get the idea real quick.\"               The\n\nwitness \"didn't really get the feeling . . . that it was a threat.\"\n\nThis statement, in any event, was about unilateral action by Drake\n\nagainst one of its wholesale customers.             It suggests competition\n\nbetween Drake's retail station and its wholesale customers' retail\n\nstations, not collusion among retailers.\n\n             Drake's and R.M. Packer's dual status as both wholesalers\n\nand retailers is thus relevant to understanding why the evidence\n\nfrom these meetings does not suffice to raise an inference of an\n\nagreement to fix prices in the retail market.               Nothing forbids\n\nproducers from selling in two different levels of the same market,\n\nhere   the   wholesale     and   retail   levels.     Cf.   Texaco   Inc.   v.\n\nHasbrouck,    496   U.S.    543,   546-50   (1990)    (describing    Texaco's\n\narrangements selling gasoline to both distributors and retailers).\n\nProducer actions in the two levels cannot be conflated to produce\n\nan antitrust violation when there is no violation in either market\n\nalone.   See Pac. Bell Tel. Co. v. Linkline Commc'ns, Inc., 129 S.\n\nCt. 1109, 1121 (2009) (stating, \"It is difficult enough for courts\n\nto identify and remedy an alleged anticompetitive practice at one\n\nlevel,\" and declining \"simultaneously to police both the wholesale\n\n\n\n\n                                     -24-\n\fand retail\" levels for price-squeezing under § 2 of the Sherman\n\nAct).\n\n             Plaintiffs   have   not   argued   that    wholesaler-retailer\n\nrelationships created vertical restraints on trade, such as minimum\n\nresale prices, affecting the retail market, and any such restraint\n\nif proven would not be illegal per se, but would be subject to\n\nanalysis for whether it had anticompetitive effects on the market.\n\nSee Leegin Creative Leather Prods., Inc. v. PSKS, Inc., 551 U.S.\n\n877, 892-94 (2007). Nor have plaintiffs argued that Drake and R.M.\n\nPacker agreed to fix wholesale prices.\n\n             Plaintiffs also point to doubts about Packer's testimony\n\nthat Tisbury Shell's profits were less than $100,000 a year and\n\nthat there had not been any dividends for more than a decade from\n\nthe   R.M.   Packer   Company    to    Packer   and    his   wife,   the   sole\n\nshareholders.     Plaintiffs produced evidence that the R.M. Packer\n\nCompany, in which Tisbury Shell accounted for about 40% of the\n\nrevenues, had profits of more than $800,000 a year, and that Packer\n\nand his wife had received more than $950,000 in dividends from the\n\ncompany from 2003 to 2007. The apparent inaccuracies in Packer's\n\ndeposition testimony are concerning, but the reason for them is\n\nunclear.     At most there are inferences, which include Packer's\n\nconfusion about the structure of his business and the lack of\n\nseparate financial statements for Tisbury Shell's portion of the\n\noverall R.M. Packer company.            The inaccuracies, though, more\n\n\n                                      -25-\n\fimportantly, are not about whether there was an illegal agreement,\n\nbut only about the amount of profits.   Whatever their cause, these\n\nstatements do not support any inference of conspiracy.   Plaintiffs\n\nthemselves concede that such \"'pretext' standing alone is not\n\nsufficient to show joint action,\" but can only strengthen an\n\ninference of joint action that is otherwise in evidence.       See\n\nDeLong Equip. Co. v. Washington Mills Abrasive Co., 887 F.2d 1499,\n\n1514 (11th Cir. 1989).\n\n           Plaintiffs have evidence of a highly favorable loan made\n\nby Drake to Paciello, owner of Edgartown Mobil and Depot Corner.\n\nPlaintiffs say that it follows from this that Paciello as retailer\n\nwould agree to whatever Drake, wearing its retailer hat, wanted.\n\nThe defendants say there was a legitimate business rationale. This\n\nwas a loan from Drake as a wholesaler trying to keep a significant\n\ncustomer in business so that Drake's wholesale business would not\n\ndiminish and would thrive.   This also explains the favorable loan\n\nrates.   In any event, it is not reasonable to infer from this that\n\nwhat Drake wanted was an illegal agreement to fix prices and that\n\nPaciello did so agree.   Paciello might be rendered more pliable,\n\nbut the loan evidence does not advance the likelihood of a tacit or\n\nexpress agreement.\n\n           The sum total of this evidence simply does not rise to\n\nthe level Matsushita requires.    Plaintiffs' ambiguous evidence is\n\nentirely consistent with permissible conscious parallelism.    See\n\n\n                                 -26-\n\fMatsushita, 475 U.S. at 588.            Plaintiffs have failed to produce\n\nevidence that \"tends to exclude the possibility of independent\n\naction.\"    Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 768.\n\n            Plaintiffs' final argument is that the district court\n\nimproperly    disregarded       their    expert's    report,       including    his\n\nconclusion that defendants' \"cost trends and coincident defendant\n\npricing patterns are inconsistent with independent, non-cooperative\n\nbehavior.\"        The district court expressly adopted the expert's\n\nconclusions about the price and cost disparities between Martha's\n\nVineyard    and    Cape   Cod   gas   stations,     and    cited    the   expert's\n\nconclusions about the ambiguity of plaintiffs' market structure\n\nevidence.    It is clear from the district court's opinion that it\n\ndid not disregard the report, and the report does not undermine the\n\nconclusion that plaintiffs have failed to show that an agreement\n\namong the defendants is a more likely explanation for their pricing\n\nbehaviors than bare conscious parallelism.\n\n            The     expert      acknowledged,       \"The     results       of    my\n\ninvestigations are mixed,\" explaining that plaintiffs' economic\n\nevidence includes \"instances that . . . are not inconsistent with\n\neither cooperative or non-cooperative behavior\" and other instances\n\nthat are inconsistent with \"independent, non-cooperative behavior.\"\n\nThe report further acknowledged that defendants' decisions to\n\nincrease prices as their costs declined, instead of undercutting\n\nother stations' prices, make no business sense \"unless you know\n\n\n                                        -27-\n\fyour rivals will follow,\" (emphasis added)--as they will, in\n\nconscious parallelism, in an interdependent oligopoly market.\n\n          As   this   court   has   said,   \"A   firm   in   a   concentrated\n\nindustry typically has reason to decide (individually) to copy an\n\nindustry leader.      After all, a higher-than-leader's price might\n\nlead a customer to buy elsewhere, while a lower-than-leader's price\n\nmight simply lead competitors to match the lower price, reducing\n\nprofits for all.      One does not need an agreement to bring about\n\nthis kind of follow-the-leader effect in a concentrated industry.\"\n\nClamp-All Corp., 851 F.2d at 484.\n\n          The antitrust claims fail.\n\n                       III. Price-Gouging Claim\n\n          Massachusetts regulatory law prohibits selling gasoline\n\nat unconscionably high prices during market emergencies. See Mass.\n\nGen. Laws ch. 93A § (2)(a), (c); 940 Mass. Code Regs. 3.18.               The\n\ndistrict court entered summary judgment against plaintiffs' state\n\nlaw claims that the defendants engaged in price-gouging in the\n\naftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005.\n\n          The rule states,\n\n     (1) It shall be an unfair or deceptive act or practice,\n     during any market emergency, for any petroleum-related\n     business to sell or offer to sell any petroleum product\n     for an amount that represents an unconscionably high\n     price.\n     (2) A price is unconscionably high if:\n          (a) the amount charged represents a gross disparity\n          between the price of the petroleum product and\n                 1. the price at which the same product was\n                 sold or offered for sale by the petroleum-\n\n                                    -28-\n\f                 related business in the usual course of\n                 business immediately prior to the onset of\n                 the market emergency, or\n                 2. the price at which the same or similar\n                 petroleum product is readily obtainable by\n                 other buyers in the trade area; and\n          (b) the disparity is not substantially attributable\n          to increased prices charged by the petroleum-\n          related business suppliers or increased costs due\n          to an abnormal market disruption.\n\nDefendants have conceded for the purpose of their motions for\n\nsummary judgment that a market emergency10 began on August 29, 2005,\n\nthe day Hurricane Katrina made landfall in the United States,\n\ncontinued through the period following Hurricane Rita, which made\n\nlandfall on September 24, and ended on December 1, 2005.11            The\n\nregulation   defines   neither   \"gross   disparity\"   nor   \"immediately\n\nprior.\"   Significantly, there have been no Massachusetts state\n\ncourt decisions interpreting the rule.      Like the district court we\n\nwrite on a clean slate.12\n\n\n     10\n          A \"market emergency\" is defined as \"[a]ny abnormal\ndisruption of any market for petroleum products, including but not\nlimited to any actual or threatened shortage in the supply . . . or\n. . . increase in the price,\" resulting from natural disaster,\nenergy failure, war, national or local emergency, or other\nextraordinary circumstances. 940 Mass. Code Regs. 3.01.\n     11\n          Whether this is the proper duration of any market\nemergency that occurred is not before us. We only note that the\nrapid decline in defendants' costs beginning in mid-September may\nindicate that any market emergency was no longer in place. See 940\nMass. Code Regs. 3.01 (defining \"market emergency\").\n     12\n          On appeal, plaintiffs ask the court to certify the\nquestion of the interpretation of the price-gouging regulation to\nthe Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. See Mass. S.J.C. R. 1:03\n§ 1; see also The Real Estate Bar Assoc. for Mass., Inc. v. Nat'l\nReal Estate Info. Servs., 608 F.3d 110, 118-19 (1st Cir. 2010).\n\n                                  -29-\n\f            Plaintiffs   argue   that    the   district     court    erred   in\n\nrejecting their interpretation that a \"gross disparity\" can be\n\nproven from a change in profit as well as from a change in retail\n\nprice.    The district court used a \"plain language\" interpretation\n\nthat     because   the   regulation     defines    when     \"[a]    price    is\n\nunconscionably high,\" 940 Mass. Code Regs. 3.18(2), the analysis\n\nturns on disparities among prices at differing times and places.\n\nAbsent such a showing about prices, the district court held, high\n\nprofit margins cannot prove unconscionability of prices.\n\n            Plaintiffs   argue   that    section   2   of   the     regulation\n\nprovides only a nonexclusive method of proving that prices are\n\nunconscionably high, and that section 2(b) contemplates examination\n\nof gross margins (as a proxy for profit margins).           They also argue\n\nthat the regulation, whatever its language, must be interpreted to\n\nbe consistent with the Federal Trade Commission's interpretations\n\nof different price-gouging definitions, because the Massachusetts\n\nstate courts refer to certain FTC interpretations when interpreting\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, the statute underlying the price-gouging\n\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs conceded at oral argument that they did not ask the\ndistrict court to certify the question. In any event, particularly\nbecause plaintiffs' case fails even under the interpretation they\nput forth, we exercise our discretion to decide the question\nourselves, declining to certify it. See Boston Gas Co. v. Century\nIndem. Co., 529 F.3d 8, 13-15 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n                                  -30-\n\fregulation.13   See Ciardi v. F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Ltd., 762 N.E.2d\n\n303, 309 (Mass. 2002).\n\n          The   facts   about   prices   during   this   period   are   not\n\ndisputed. Plaintiffs summarize their evidence as showing that from\n\nAugust 30, the day after Katrina made landfall, to the end of the\n\nemergency period, the absolute maximum increase in defendants'\n\ngross margin per gallon of regular gas ranged from 36 to 51 cents,\n\nrepresenting 38% to 68% increases.        Using less volatile monthly\n\naverages, plaintiffs' Exhibit 13 shows maximum increases in gross\n\nmargins during the market emergency of 25 cents or 38% at R.M.\n\nPacker's Tisbury Shell, 35 cents or 69% at Drake's XtraMart Citgo,\n\n31 cents or 51% at Paciello's Edgartown Mobil, and 31 cents or 54%\n\nat Depot Corner.    Tisbury Shell's maximum margin was in November;\n\nthe other three stations' were in October.\n\n\n\n     13\n          The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court \"looks to\ninterpretations by the Federal Trade Commission . . . of § 5(a)(1)\nof the Federal Trade Commission Act\" for guidance in interpreting\n\"what constitutes unfair methods of competition and unfair or\ndeceptive acts or practices, which are not defined in G.L. c. 93A.\"\nCiardi v. F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Ltd., 762 N.E.2d 303, 309 (Mass.\n2002) (emphasis added); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A § 2.     Even where\nit is appropriate to consider them, however, the FTC's\ninterpretations    are   \"ordinarily   instructive    rather   than\nconclusive.\" In re TJX Cos. Retail Sec. Breach Litig., 564 F.3d\n489, 497 (1st Cir. 2009). Here, we note that the FTC's petroleum\npricing investigation was conducted under a specific mandate from\nCongress outside the FTCA that included the definition of price-\ngouging that the FTC was to use, see Federal Trade Commission,\nInvestigation of Gasoline Price Manipulation and Post-Katrina\nGasoline Price Increases iii (2006). Moreover, the Massachusetts\nAttorney General has promulgated a specific rule defining price-\ngouging for purposes of Chapter 93A.\n\n                                  -31-\n\f                Focusing on absolute changes in price per gallon from the\n\nweek before to the week following Hurricane Katrina's August 29\n\nlandfall, prices rose 20 cents at Tisbury Shell, 48 cents at\n\nXtraMart Citgo, 42 cents at Edgartown Mobil, and 42 cents at Depot\n\nCorner.        Prices continued to rise, to a maximum increase in early\n\nSeptember of 37 cents at Tisbury Shell14 and 60 cents at XtraMart\n\nCitgo,15 Edgartown Mobil,16 and Depot Corner.17            During the week\n\nbeginning on September 27, just after Hurricane Rita made landfall\n\non September 24, prices were still above their August 22-28 pre-\n\nKatrina levels by 32 cents at Tisbury Shell, 42 cents at XtraMart\n\nCitgo, and 35 cents at both Edgartown Mobil and Depot Corner.\n\n                The language of the price-gouging regulation does not\n\nreach        gross   disparities   in   price   alone.   The   regulation   is\n\nconcerned with increases in both price and cost, the two factors\n\nthat determine gross margin.             We need not address the separate\n\nissue of whether a gross disparity between pre-emergency and post-\n\n\n\n     14\n          Tisbury's high price, held from September 7 to at least\nSeptember 18, was $3.57, 37 cents more than its August 22-28\naverage price of $3.20.\n     15\n          XtraMart Citgo's high price, held from September 2-18,\nwas $3.70, 60 cents more than its constant August 22-28 price of\n$3.10.\n        16\n          Edgartown Mobil's high price, held from September 3 to at\nleast September 5, was $3.89, 60 cents more than its constant\nAugust 22-28 price of $3.29.\n     17\n          Depot Corner's high price, held from September 3-8, was\n$3.85, 60 cents more than its constant August 22-28 price of $3.25.\n\n                                        -32-\n\femergency gross margins might make out a claim of price-gouging\n\nwhere an increase in absolute price does not in itself appear\n\nunconscionable.   See, e.g., People ex rel. Spitzer v. My Serv.\n\nCtr., Inc., No. 06-21157, 2007 WL 102463, at *2 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. Jan.\n\n17, 2007) (using increase in gross margin from 67 to 99 cents to\n\nillustrate that price increase of about 32 cents was price-gouging\n\nunder New York law); People ex rel. Spitzer v. Wever Petroleum,\n\nInc., 827 N.Y.S.2d 813, 816 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2006) (finding increase\n\nof 60 cents in gross margin made increase of 87 cents in price\n\n\"unconscionably excessive\" under New York law).\n\n          The   rule   encompasses   price   and   margin   increases   in\n\nrelation to one another.     Dramatic changes in gross margin might\n\nillustrate that a price increase is a \"gross disparity\" in price\n\nbecause it reflects price increases unexplained by cost increases.\n\nBut nothing in the regulation suggests that increases in gross\n\nmargin alone, in the absence of any price increase and simultaneous\n\nwith declining retail prices, can support a price-gouging claim.\n\n          While there is no specific history available as to the\n\nMassachusetts price-gouging rule, such rules are generally designed\n\nto protect consumers from acute and unconscionable increases in the\n\nprices they must pay for basic consumer goods during times of\n\nmarket emergency, not to mandate that retailers decrease their\n\nprices as quickly as their costs decline after the most acute\n\ncrisis in supply of the good has passed.     See, e.g., Ark. Code Ann.\n\n\n                                 -33-\n\f§ 4-88-301 (declaring legislative purpose to prevent \"excessive and\n\nunjustified increases\" in prices); Cal. Penal Code § 396 (\"It is\n\nthe intent of the Legislature . . . to protect citizens from\n\nexcessive     and   unjustified   increases   in   the   prices   charged\n\n. . . .\").    These are not regulations meant to give the government\n\ncontrol over the setting of petroleum product prices.\n\n             The facts show that while defendants' average weekly\n\nprices were increasing, during the time periods of August 30-\n\nSeptember 5 and September 6-12, their gross margins were generally\n\nrising only very moderately, since their costs were climbing as\n\nwell.18   Average margins rose at Tisbury Shell from 74 cents during\n\nthe August 22-28 period to 78 cents from August 30-September 5,\n\nbefore dropping back down to 61 cents the following week.         During\n\nthe same time periods, margins at XtraMart rose from 53 cents to 87\n\ncents before falling back to 68 cents, margins at Edgartown Mobil\n\nrose from 66 cents to 68 cents and then to 76 cents, and margins at\n\nDepot Corner rose from 62 cents to 64 cents and then to 72 cents.\n\n\n\n\n     18\n          To calculate average weekly prices, costs, and margins,\nthe data used was from plaintiffs' Exhibit 11, which provided daily\nprice and cost data for all four defendants from July 15 through\nNovember 7, 2005. Where price or cost data for a given day was\nmissing, we imputed the value from the most recent recorded value.\nThe parties' citations for prices and gross margins vary among\ndaily, weekly, monthly, and entire-period averages. We have used\nweekly, rather than daily or monthly averages, in order to capture\nthe major trends in defendants' price and margin changes that other\nmeasures would obscure.\n\n                                   -34-\n\f          There is marked volatility in the margins, best shown by\n\nthe swing in average gross margin at XtraMart Citgo from 53 cents\n\nduring the week before Katrina to 87 cents during the first week\n\nafter, but dropping back to 68 cents one week later as its costs\n\ncontinued to rise.     This volatility resulted from mismatches\n\nbetween when the stations raised their prices and when they had to\n\npay higher costs at wholesale.19   At XtraMart, for example, prices\n\nrose from $3.50 on September 1 to $3.70 a gallon on September 2,\n\nwhen costs were $2.47 a gallon, but there was no further increase\n\nin price at XtraMart after costs rose to $3.15 a gallon on\n\nSeptember 5.   And the initial twenty-cent price increase to $3.70\n\na gallon itself came two days after a short-lived but sharp\n\nincrease in XtraMart's costs from $2.56 to $2.93 per gallon, before\n\ncosts dropped to $2.47 on September 2. Unless the resulting prices\n\nare \"unconscionably high,\" the price-gouging rule does not prohibit\n\nretailers from raising their prices in reasonable anticipation of\n\nfuture increases in costs, or after the fact in response to actual\n\nrecent increases even if costs have dropped back down again.\n\n          Defendants' margins hit their highest levels after their\n\nretail prices began to decline.       It appears that the stations'\n\ncosts dropped precipitously beginning in mid-September, but that\n\nthey dropped their prices at a much slower rate.      The stations'\n\n\n\n     19\n          Some apparent volatility may also be attributable to the\nmissing data referred to in the previous footnote.\n\n                               -35-\n\faverage weekly gross margins thus began a general rise from the\n\nweek of September 13 well into October and November.        But no\n\nstation raised its price after September 7, and all four had\n\ndropped from their highest price by September 20 at the very\n\nlatest.\n\n          Neither the absolute increases in price nor the increases\n\nin gross margins show any \"gross disparity\" in price.   As we have\n\nmentioned, no Massachusetts law defines \"gross disparity\" for the\n\npurposes of the price-gouging regulation.   By analogy, however, in\n\nthe context of unconscionable contracts, a Massachusetts case does\n\nrefer to a \"gross disparity\" as requiring \"gross inadequacy of\n\nconsideration.\"     Waters v. Min Ltd., 587 N.E.2d 231, 234 (Mass.\n\n1992) (quoting 1 A. Corbin, Contracts § 128, at 551 (1963 & Supp.\n\n1991)).   That court said the disparity must \"lead[] inevitably to\n\nthe felt conclusion that knowing advantage was taken\" of consumers.\n\nId. at 233 (quoting Jones v. Star Credit Corp., 298 N.Y.S.2d 264\n\n(N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1969)).    Those standards have not been met here.\n\n          The Federal Trade Commission report on which plaintiffs\n\nrely would not lead us to a different result, and so we do not\n\ndecide what, if any, deference the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial\n\nCourt would give it.    See Federal Trade Commission, Investigation\n\nof Gasoline Price Manipulation and Post-Katrina Gasoline Price\n\nIncreases (2006).      Plaintiffs cite the FTC's statement that an\n\nincrease in average margin of more than five cents is \"a price\n\n\n                                 -36-\n\fincrease that was not substantially explained by increased costs.\"\n\nId. at 151.    But they incorrectly state that the FTC equated this\n\nfive-cent margin increase with price-gouging.           In fact, the FTC\n\nReport    required   an   additional   conclusion--that     a   retailer's\n\nabsolute price increase exceeded the national average increase of\n\nthirty-five cents, as well as the average increase in the station's\n\nlocal area, by at least five cents--before it was considered to\n\nhave engaged in price-gouging.         Id. at 152.     Under plaintiffs'\n\nexpert's definition of Cape Cod as the relevant \"trade area\" under\n\nthe Massachusetts price-gouging rule, none of defendants' gas\n\nstations were price-gouging under the FTC's methodology: average\n\ngas prices on the Cape increased by 53 cents from August to\n\nSeptember, while defendants' average gas prices increased between\n\n42 and 54 cents.20\n\n            Plaintiffs have not shown a \"gross disparity\" in prices\n\nunder the state price-gouging rule, even taking into account\n\ndefendants' gross margins during the period of price increases.\n\n            The   only    question     before     us   is   whether   the\n\nsupracompetitive prices charged by defendants on Martha's Vineyard\n\nare a result of illegal actions in violation of federal antitrust\n\nlaws or state anti-price-gouging rules.         Plaintiffs have failed to\n\n\n     20\n          These monthly average increases from August to September\nare less than the maximum increases reported for each defendant\nabove. The monthly average increases were 42 cents for Tisbury\nShell, 54 cents for XtraMart Citgo, and 53 cents for Edgartown\nMobil and Depot Corner.\n\n                                  -37-\n\fmeet the legal standards for proof of those violations.   The\n\njudgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -38-\n\f",

Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.,</i> 509 U.S. 209, 227, 113 S.Ct. 2578, 125 L.Ed.2d 168 (1993). <span class=\"star-pagination\">*576</span> Conscious parallelism<sup>[3]</sup> is a phenomenon of oligopolistic markets<sup>[4]</sup> in which firms \"might in effect share monopoly power, setting their prices at a profit-maximizing, supracompetitive level by recognizing their shared economic interests and their interdependence with respect to price and output decisions.\" <i>Id.</i> Each producer may independently decide that it can maximize its profits by matching one or more other producers' price, on the hope that the market will be able to maintain high prices if the producers do not undercut one another.</p>\n<p>A tacit agreementone in which only the conspirators' actions, and not any express communications, indicate the existence of an agreementis distinguished from mere conscious parallelism by \"uniform behavior among competitors, preceded by conversations implying that later uniformity might prove desirable or accompanied by other conduct that in context suggests that each competitor failed to make an independent decision.\" <i>Brown v. Pro Football, Inc.,</i> 518 U.S. 231, 241, 116 S.Ct. 2116, 135 L.Ed.2d 521 (1996) (internal citations omitted). In the seminal case, <i>Interstate Circuit v. United States,</i> 306 U.S. 208, 59 S.Ct. 467, 83 L.Ed. 610 (1939), the Supreme Court found a tacit agreement where a dominant movie theater company sent a letter openly addressed to all eight major national film distributors stating that it would show a distributor's films only if the distributor imposed certain restrictions on later runs of the films in secondary theaters. <i>Id.</i> at 215-19, 59 S.Ct. 467. The Supreme Court held that the distributors, who never communicated directly with one another, nonetheless had entered into a tacit agreement with one another by acting in accordance with the letter's demands, because the letter made it clear that all eight had received the letter, the economic context made it clear that all eight needed to act uniformly or all would lose business, and all eight did in fact impose the conditions. <i>Id.</i> at 222, 59 S.Ct. 467. The opinion has been criticized, <i>see, e.g.,</i> 3B Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp, <i>Antitrust Law</i> ¶ 810b, at 470-71 (3d ed. 2008), but the Supreme Court has recently reiterated that tacit agreements are still agreements under the Sherman Act, <i>Twombly,</i> 550 U.S. at 553, 127 S.Ct. 1955.</p>\n<p>Some markets are particularly conducive to maintaining consciously parallel <span class=\"star-pagination\">*577</span> pricing without the need for agreement among the producers. \"Tacit coordination is facilitated by a stable market environment, fungible products, and a small number of variables upon which the firms seeking to coordinate their pricing may focus.\" <i>Brooke Grp.,</i> 509 U.S. at 238, 113 S.Ct. 2578. Such coordination is also easier to maintain when these fungible goods \"are repeatedly sold in market transactions that are immediately known in every detail by customers and rivals.\" 6 Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp, <i>Antitrust Law</i> ¶ 1430b, at 225 (3d ed. 2010). A geographically constrained gasoline market with publicly posted prices has these characteristics.</p>\n<p>Because supracompetitive prices prices above what they would be in a perfectly competitive marketcan result from both lawful conscious parallelism and an unlawful agreement to fix prices, antitrust doctrine has developed evidentiary standards to minimize the risk that legal conduct will be chilled or punished. <i>Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Serv. Corp.,</i> 465 U.S. 752, 763, 104 S.Ct. 1464, 79 L.Ed.2d 775 (1984). Plaintiffs must establish that it is plausible that defendants are engaged in more than mere conscious parallelism, by pleading and later producing evidence pointing toward conspiracy, sometimes referred to as \"plus factors.\" <i>See </i><i>Twombly,</i> 550 U.S. at 556 &amp; n. 4, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (requiring antitrust plaintiffs to plead behavior more consistent with agreement than with independence); <i>In re Flat Glass Antitrust Litig.,</i> 385 F.3d 350, 360 (3d Cir.2004) (explaining that \"plus factors\" are \"proxies for direct evidence of an agreement\").</p>\n<p>In addition, the Supreme Court has \"limit[ed] the range of permissible inferences from ambiguous evidence in a § 1 case,\" holding that, at summary judgment, \"conduct as consistent with permissible competition as with illegal conspiracy does not, standing alone, support an inference of antitrust conspiracy\" that allows plaintiffs' evidence to reach a jury. <i>Matsushita Elec.

This is the common understanding and plaintiffs do not disagree.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Factual and Procedural Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The underlying facts of the case, including the district court's description of the retail gasoline market on Martha's Vineyard, are undisputed.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs are summer and year-round residents of Martha's Vineyard and an island real estate agency. Defendants operate four of the nine gas stations on Martha's Vineyard. In Edgartown, individual defendant Francis Paciello owns the Edgartown Mobil station. The defendant corporation Depot Corner, Inc., which is wholly owned by Paciello, owns the Depot Corner station, also in Edgartown. In Vineyard Haven, about seven miles northwest of Edgartown, defendant corporation Drake/Kenyon (Drake)<sup>[6]</sup> owns the Xtra-Mart Citgo station in Vineyard Haven and also supplies gasoline to the Edgartown stations at wholesale. Defendant corporation R.M. Packer, also in Vineyard Haven, owns the Tisbury Shell gas station; R.M. Packer is owned by the individuals Ralph Packer and his wife.</p>\n<p>Of the other five gas stations on the island, two are in Oak Bluffs, about three miles from Vineyard Haven, one is in Edgartown, and two are on the western part of the island in West Tisbury and Chilmark.</p>\n<p>The defendants' prices exceeded prices at gas stations on Cape Cod by an average of fifty-six cents per gallon during a five year period beginning on August 1, 2003, according to calculations performed by plaintiffs' expert and cited by the district court. Twenty-one cents of that difference is attributable to the higher costs of transporting gas to the island than to the mainland Cape.</p>\n<p>The retail gasoline market on Martha's Vineyard has features that make it susceptible to efforts by gas stations to sustain supracompetitive prices. These features would facilitate both conspiratorial pricing and merely interdependent parallel pricing for several reasons. <i>See</i> 2B Areeda, Hovenkamp, &amp; Solow, <i>supra,</i> ¶ 404, at 9-20.</p>\n<p>First, would-be competitors attracted to the market by high profit margins face a regulatory barrier to entry: they need permission from the Martha's Vineyard Commission. The Commission has denied all petitions to open new gas stations since 1997. This, along with their location on a relatively small island, insulates the current stations from competition.</p>\n<p>Second, customer demand for gasoline on an island is inelastic, meaning customers will not buy much less gas when prices rise, because they cannot choose to drive farther away to get cheaper gas. Gasoline in general is a nondurable good, so that customers have to buy it frequently and are not likely to simply stay out of the market until prices drop. This is particularly true for customers who are summer residents and are in the market for only limited periods of time.</p>\n<p>Third, gasoline is a homogeneous good, so consumers decide where to buy it based mostly on price and convenience, leading competing gas stations to prominently post prices. This posting also lets competitors know and respond in real time to one another's prices, allowing them to catch price \"cheaters\" and to follow price \"leaders.\" <i>See id.</i> ¶ 404b3, at 14-15 (describing cheating); 6 Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp, <i>supra,</i> ¶ 1430d, at 226 (describing leading); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Heffernan,</i> 43 F.3d <span class=\"star-pagination\">*579</span> 1144, 1149 (7th Cir.1994) (describing catching price cheaters). Since there are only nine gas stations on the entire island, each station can easily monitor and respond to the prices of the others. If one station drops its price in order to attract more business, the others can quickly drop their prices in response. The original \"cheater\" benefits very little from undercutting its competitors' prices, because when any one of them drops its prices the competitors can match the price before many customers respond to the incentive. And all of the stations suffer a decrease in profit margin.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a station acting as a price \"leader\" risks little by raising its price under such market conditions. Other stations are likely to follow, given the possibility of higher prices and profit margins for all. If for some reason the competitors do not follow the increases, the leader can easily drop its price again to match the other stations so quickly that few customers are lost to lower-priced competition. Knowing these features of the market, each gas station owner is likely to reach its own independent conclusion that its best interests involve keeping prices high, including following price changes by a price \"leader\" (if one emerges), in confidence that the other station owners will reach the same independent conclusion. Here there is no evidence or suggestion that the business risk to any station on Martha's Vineyard of raising its prices was so great as to require communication among stations before any one of them would venture it.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs, angered by what they saw as unjustifiably high prices at the pump, brought suit in Massachusetts Superior Court on August 2, 2007 alleging that defendants had conspired to fix retail gas prices since at least December 31, 1999. Defendants removed the case to federal court on August 28, 2007,<sup>[7]</sup> after which plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, substituting Sherman Anti-Trust Act price-fixing allegations or their original Massachusetts Antitrust Act allegations. Due to the Sherman Act's four-year statute of limitations, 15 U.S.C. § 15b, the district court limited plaintiffs' price-fixing claim to violations occurring on or after August 2, 2003. The district court allowed discovery, but denied the parties' joint requests for discovery of detailed sales and financial data from other Martha's Vineyard gas stations not named in the suit. Following a June 24, 2009, hearing on defendants' motions for summary judgment, the district court granted defendants' motions on January 6, 2010.</p>\n<p>Although our review is de novo, we describe the district court's thoughtful analysis. The district court reasoned that most of the evidence the plaintiffs proffered was no more consistent with conspiracy than with independent choices to engage in parallel pricing. The district court found other evidence not sufficiently probative of conspiracy. First, the district court found that Drake's employment of a consultant to lobby the Martha's Vineyard Commission to deny petitions for new gas stations was \"conduct that would be expected even in a competitive gasoline retail market.\" <i>White v. R.M. Packer Co.,</i> No. 07-11601, slip op. at 6 n. 5 (D.Mass. Jan. 6, 2010). Second, the district court found too attenuated the evidence that two of the defendants communicated with one another about prices in 1999 because the communications concerned the wholesale, rather than retail, market and occurred years <span class=\"star-pagination\">*580</span> before the period covered by the limitations period. The district court found it troubling that an unusually generous loan from Drake to Paciello may have provided Paciello with an incentive to conspire with Drake, but held that this was not enough to permit a reasonable jury to find an agreement to fix prices.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Merits of Plaintiffs' Appeal from Entry of Summary Judgment</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs argue that the district court erred by (1) applying the wrong legal standard, (2) considering their evidence of plus factors piecemeal rather than as a whole, and (3) ignoring their expert evidence.</p>\n<p>First, plaintiffs argue that the district court, despite correctly stating the legal standard to which it held plaintiffs' evidence, proceeded in fact as if plaintiffs are required to \"exclude,\" rather than \"tend to exclude,\" the possibility of independent action. <i>See </i><i>Matsushita,</i> 475 U.S. at 588, 106 S.Ct. 1348. Having reviewed the entire record, we disagree. Nothing in the district court's opinion suggests that the court required plaintiffs to produce direct evidence of conspiracy as plaintiffs claim.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>Plaintiffs also argue that defendants' concession for summary judgment purposes that there has been parallel pricing \"gets plaintiffs close to defeating summary judgment\" because of the statement in <i>Twombly</i> that \"[a]n allegation of parallel conduct ... gets [a] <i>complaint</i> close to stating a claim\" for purposes of surviving an initial <i>motion to dismiss. </i><i>Twombly,</i> 550 U.S. at 557, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (emphasis added). As a statement of the law at summary judgment, plaintiffs are flatly wrong. Mere parallelism, whether stipulated or proven, does not even create a prima facie conspiracy case. <i>See </i><i>Brooke Grp.,</i> 509 U.S. at 227, 113 S.Ct. 2578.</p>\n<p>Much of the evidence plaintiffs offer as \"plus factors,\" even when viewed in the light most favorable to them, does no more than corroborate that the Martha's Vineyard gasoline market is an oligopolistic market which is highly conducive to parallel pricing. The evidence does nothing to explain whether the parallel pricing was achieved by agreement or mere interdependent decisions. Plaintiffs' remaining evidence does not \"`tend[] to exclude the possibility' that the alleged conspirators acted independently,\" and so is not enough to permit a reasonable inference that defendants' behavior was more than mere conscious parallelism. <i>Matsushita,</i> 475 U.S. at 588, 106 S.Ct. 1348 (quoting <i>Monsanto,</i> 465 U.S. at 764, 104 S.Ct. 1464). The report of plaintiffs' expert witness, Boston College economics professor Frank Gollop, does not alter the conclusion. The report was adequately considered by the district court. It does not undermine, and in fact is consistent with, our conclusion and that of the district court.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs draw their list of plus factors from the authorities mentioned in the Supreme Court's <i>Twombly</i> opinion as providing \"examples of parallel conduct allegations that would state a § 1 claim\" under the heightened pleading standard established in that case. <i>Twombly,</i> 550 U.S. at 557 n. 4, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (citing 6 Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp, <i>supra,</i> ¶ 1425, at 167-85; Michael D. Blechman, <i>Conscious Parallelism, Signalling and Facilitation Devices,</i> 24 N.Y.L. Sch. L. Rev. 881, 899 (1979)). <span class=\"star-pagination\">*581</span> Plaintiffs also invoke a list of plus factors described in Judge Posner's antitrust monograph. <i>See</i> Richard Posner, <i>Antitrust Law</i> 69-93 (2d ed. 2001). Yet as these sources themselves emphasize, many so-called plus factors simply \"demonstrate that a given market is chronically non-competitive,\" without helping to explain whether agreement or conscious parallelism is the cause. Blechman, <i>supra,</i> at 898; <i>see also</i> 6 Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp, <i>supra,</i> ¶ 1434, at 263-69 (explaining that \"plus factors\" which merely restate interdependence are prerequisites to an inference of agreement but are not enough); Posner, <i>supra,</i> at 69-79 (listing seventeen factors as useful in identifying markets conducive to conscious parallelism). To be sure, providing this evidence demonstrates that plaintiffs' claim is not economically implausible. <i>See </i><i>Matsushita,</i> 475 U.S. at 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348 (\"[I]f the claim is one that simply makes no economic sense[, plaintiffs] must come forward with more persuasive evidence to support their claim than would otherwise be necessary.\"). But such evidence does not by itself suggest that defendants' conduct shows agreement. <i>See </i><i>Flat Glass,</i> 385 F.3d at 360-61; <i>see also </i><i>In re High Fructose Corn Syrup Antitrust Litig.,</i> 295 F.3d 651, 658 (7th Cir. 2002) (Posner, J.) (distinguishing \"evidence of noncompetitive behavior\" from \"evidence that the structure of the market was conducive to such behavior\").</p>\n<p>We have considered the totality of plaintiffs' evidence, as did the district court, and discuss the inadequacy of the parts as well as of the whole. Six of plaintiffs' nine plus factors show nothing more than that the gasoline market on Martha's Vineyard is conducive to conscious parallelism. We begin with two that describe defendants' pricing behavior. First, during three periods in 2004 and 2005 the defendants, in parallel, held prices steady or raised them while the cost of gasoline at wholesale declined. Second, defendants have enjoyed what plaintiffs call \"abnormal profits.\" It is true, as plaintiffs state, that changes in pricing patterns and profit levels may be useful in identifying the <i>beginning</i> of a conspiracy, immediately after which conspirators may successfully raise prices without reference to costs. <i>See</i> Posner, <i>supra,</i> at 88, 90; <i>see also </i><i>Text Messaging,</i> 630 F.3d at 628 (stating that in a competitive market \"falling costs ... motivat[e a seller], in the absence of agreement, to reduce his price slightly in order to take business from his competitors\").</p>\n<p>However, these pricing behaviors do not function as \"plus factors\" when they are stable over time, because that factual context undermines any inference that the pricing behavior represents a sudden shift marking the <i>beginning</i> of a price-fixing conspiracy. Here, plaintiffs allege a price-fixing conspiracy dating back \"at least as early as December 31, 1999\"; there is no suggestion that defendants' behavior changed in 2004, in 2005, or at any other relevant time. In this factual context, evidence that defendants set supracompetitive prices that did not decline when their costs declined shows no more than that they made their pricing decisions in an oligopolistic, rather than competitive, market.</p>\n<p>Other evidence also undermines plaintiffs' arguments about defendants' pricing behaviors. Plaintiffs' own expert stated that \"[n]o unambiguous conclusion ... can be gleaned from [defendants'] pattern of parallel pricing,\" and that he could \"draw no behavioral conclusion\" from the divergence between the defendants' declining costs and retail prices, since it could \"be the result of a supra-competitive price umbrella.\" Further, the expert did not explain whether in his opinion such an \"umbrella\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*582</span> would even require agreement. Similarly ambiguous is deposition testimony as to three of the four stations, by the principals of defendants Drake and Depot Corner, Inc., that they did not know what margin over cost they needed to charge to turn a profit. Plaintiffs argue that without a price agreement such ignorance would be \"suicidal,\" but the testimony equally supports the inference that stations' pricing decisions in this market are not based, as they would be in a competitive market, on cost, but rather on the actions and expected actions of other stations.</p>\n<p>A third plus factor offered by plaintiffs is that defendants had \"motive to conspire\" because cooperating with one another could allow them to earn supracompetitive profits. Taking as a given that all of the defendants had motive to conspire with one another to earn high profits, all such a motive shows is that the defendants could reasonably expect to earn higher profits by keeping prices at a supracompetitive level through parallel pricing practices. <i>Matsushita</i> states that evidence showing defendants have \"a plausible reason to conspire\" does not create a triable issue as to whether there was a conspiracy. <i>Matsushita,</i> 475 U.S. at 596-97 &amp; n. 21, 106 S.Ct. 1348; 6 Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp, <i>supra,</i> ¶ 1434(c)(1), at 269 (\"Motivation is thus synonymous with interdependence and therefore adds nothing to it.\"). We take up later the issue of whether a $2 million loan at a below-market interest rate from Drake to Paciello, when Paciello could not obtain a loan from other lenders, gave Paciello motive to \"do Drake's bidding regarding keeping up gas prices\" as plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p>Three other plus factors plaintiffs allege are that the Martha's Vineyard retail gasoline market (1) is insulated by high barriers to entry, thanks to the Martha's Vineyard Commission's demonstrated gatekeeping power, (2) faces highly inelastic demand for gasoline, and (3) is marked by stable relative market shares over time among the four defendants. High barriers to entry and inelastic demand are two hallmarks of oligopolistic markets susceptible to successful parallel pricing practices, but neither helps to distinguish between agreement and mere conscious parallelism as the root cause of those practices. \"[W]ithout barriers to entry it would presumably be impossible to maintain supracompetitive prices. ...\" <i>Matsushita,</i> 475 U.S. at 591 n. 15, 106 S.Ct. 1348; <i>see also </i><i>Williamson Oil Co. v. Philip Morris USA,</i> 346 F.3d 1287, 1317 (11th Cir.2003) (describing high barriers to entry and inelastic demand as two indicia of oligopoly). And while stable market shares over time may suggest in some factual contexts that the firms \"eliminated competition[] among themselves,\" Posner, <i>supra,</i> at 79, it is also likely that conscious parallelism would be sufficient to maintain stable relative market shares in a stable market for a basic commodity protected from new entry. The district court specifically cited plaintiffs' expert's acknowledgment that the \"nearly constant market shares are consistent with both cooperative and non-cooperative pricing behavior.\" <i>See White,</i> slip op. at 6.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs' seventh factor is that variations in price from region to region may indicate collusion. This may be true on some facts. <i>See</i> Posner, <i>supra,</i> at 87. But plaintiffs err in pointing to the difference in gas prices between Cape Cod and Martha's Vineyard. Even discounting the higher transportation costs of getting fuel to the island gas stations, we have already discussed a number of lawful reasons why the island stations are likely to be able to maintain the rest of the variation in price without agreement.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*583</span> Plaintiffs' eighth purported plus factor is that Drake's employment of a consultant to lobby the Martha's Vineyard Commission to deny a petition for a new gas station on the island proves that Drake \"was willing to act secretly to influence gas prices.\" Drake's unilateral retention of a consultant was a legitimate exercise of its right to petition. There is no claim that the consultant or the Commission acted illegally. In addition, this was entirely economically rational behavior, whatever the Commission decided. Indeed, these actions are well within those actions which the Supreme Court sought to protect from chilling effects. <i>See </i><i>Monsanto,</i> 465 U.S. at 763, 104 S.Ct. 1464.</p>\n<p>Other pieces of evidence require further examination and we consider them the strongest evidence plaintiffs have advanced. Plaintiffs produced some evidence that two of the defendants' principals communicated with one another and may have been untruthful about the communication. This fits with a different type of plus factor: \"traditional\" conspiracy evidence of the type that helps to distinguish between conscious parallelism and collusion and that is necessary to an inference of agreement. <i>Flat Glass,</i> 385 F.3d at 362; 6 Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp, <i>supra,</i> ¶ 1434b, at 267. This need not be direct evidence; circumstantial evidence can suffice to establish an antitrust conspiracy. <i>Monsanto,</i> 465 U.S. at 764, 104 S.Ct. 1464.</p>\n<p>Two witnesses recalled meetings held ten years earlier, in December 1999, with Jim Ahern of defendant Drake about contracting with Drake to be the wholesale gas supplier for a new gas station they were trying to open on the island. At the first meeting, the two described a ten-cent retail price discount for year-round Vine-yard residents that they proposed to offer in order to convince the Martha's Vineyard Commission to approve their permit. Ahern replied that he would not give year-round residents a discount.<sup>[9]</sup> Then, referring to Ralph Packer, whose company R.M. Packer was the owner of Tisbury Shell, Ahern made the point that businesses on the Vineyard were also not inclined to give discounts, saying, \"Your boy Ralph Packer, an island boy, is not cutting people any slack, and I'm not going to either.\" It is not clear from the record whether Ahern was speaking as a wholesaler or retailer in refusing to contemplate a discount, since both his company and Ralph Packer's company, R.M. Packer, played both wholesaler and retailer roles on Martha's Vineyard. R.M. Packer supplied other stations on the island that are not defendants. Drake supplied the two defendant stations owned by Paciello, but also was a wholesaler to a number of stations elsewhere on the East Coast.</p>\n<p>At the second meeting, during a discussion between the two witnesses and Ahern about the discount, when the subject of Ralph Packer arose Ahern said, \"You know we talk.\" Ahern then called on speakerphone a person whom Ahern said was Packer. It appeared to the witnesses that the call's recipient recognized Ahern's voice without Ahern identifying himself. We assume, in plaintiffs' favor, that the call recipient was Packer. Ahern casually stated to Packer that he was just checking in, and hung up after a friendly, general conversation of under five minutes. Ahern and Packer did not discuss the witnesses' desire to open a station, pricing or other business. One witness said he thought Ahern made the call \"to demonstrate ... that it didn't really matter who we chose as a distributor, we'd have the same wholesale <span class=\"star-pagination\">*584</span> price.\" The witness also said that after this conversation, Ahern told them, \"we all work together,\" and said, \"I talk to Packer frequently.\"</p>\n<p>Yet Ahern said in a 2009 deposition that he did not recall talking to Ralph Packer on the phone and only had one business meeting with him. Packer, in a 2008 deposition, said he met once with Ahern about wholesale supply about fifteen years earlier and had no phone conversations with him. In context, even if Ahern's and Packer's denials that they spoke over the phone were untrue, Ahern's actions and statements demonstrated at most a wholesaler's attempt to show his leverage over a potential wholesale customer, and are vague, ambiguous, and non-probative with regard to retail pricing practices.</p>\n<p>There was more evidence about that meeting. One of the witnesses seeking permission to open a new station stated his view that if the new station were to offer gasoline at a lower price, there would be a chain reaction and the other stations would also lower their prices. In response to conjecture on what would happen if the two Paciello stations supplied by Ahern's company, Drake, started dropping their prices, Ahern replied, \"if they start mucking around with prices one or two delivery trucks a week might not make it on the boat and they'll get the idea real quick.\" The witness \"didn't really get the feeling... that it was a threat.\" This statement, in any event, was about unilateral action by Drake against one of its wholesale customers. It suggests competition between Drake's retail station and its wholesale customers' retail stations, not collusion among retailers.</p>\n<p>Drake's and R.M. Packer's dual status as both wholesalers and retailers is thus relevant to understanding why the evidence from these meetings does not suffice to raise an inference of an agreement to fix prices <i>in the retail market.</i> Nothing forbids producers from selling in two different levels of the same market, here the wholesale and retail levels. <i>Cf. </i><i>Texaco Inc. v. Hasbrouck,</i> 496 U.S. 543, 546-50, 110 S.Ct. 2535, 110 L.Ed.2d 492 (1990) (describing Texaco's arrangements selling gasoline to both distributors and retailers). Producer actions in the two levels cannot be conflated to produce an antitrust violation when there is no violation in either market alone. <i>See </i><i>Pac. Bell Tel. Co. v. Linkline Commc'ns, Inc.,</i> 555 U.S. 438, 129 S.Ct. 1109, 1121, 172 L.Ed.2d 836 (2009) (stating, \"It is difficult enough for courts to identify and remedy an alleged anticompetitive practice at one level,\" and declining \"simultaneously to police both the wholesale and retail\" levels for price-squeezing under § 2 of the Sherman Act).</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs have not argued that wholesaler-retailer relationships created vertical restraints on trade, such as minimum resale prices, affecting the retail market, and any such restraint if proven would not be illegal per se, but would be subject to analysis for whether it had anticompetitive effects on the market. <i>See </i><i>Leegin Creative Leather Prods., Inc. v. PSKS, Inc.,</i> 551 U.S. 877, 892-94, 127 S.Ct. 2705, 168 L.Ed.2d 623 (2007). Nor have plaintiffs argued that Drake and R.M. Packer agreed to fix wholesale prices.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs also point to doubts about Packer's testimony that Tisbury Shell's profits were less than $100,000 a year and that there had not been any dividends for more than a decade from the R.M. Packer Company to Packer and his wife, the sole shareholders. Plaintiffs produced evidence that the R.M. Packer Company, in which Tisbury Shell accounted for about 40% of the revenues, had profits of more than $800,000 a year, and that Packer and his wife had received more than <span class=\"star-pagination\">*585</span> $950,000 in dividends from the company from 2003 to 2007. The apparent inaccuracies in Packer's deposition testimony are concerning, but the reason for them is unclear. At most there are inferences, which include Packer's confusion about the structure of his business and the lack of separate financial statements for Tisbury Shell's portion of the overall R.M. Packer company. The inaccuracies, though, more importantly, are not about whether there was an illegal agreement, but only about the amount of profits. Whatever their cause, these statements do not support any inference of conspiracy. Plaintiffs themselves concede that such \"`pretext' standing alone is not sufficient to show joint action,\" but can only strengthen an inference of joint action that is otherwise in evidence. <i>See </i><i>DeLong Equip. Co. v. Washington Mills Abrasive Co.,</i> 887 F.2d 1499, 1514 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs have evidence of a highly favorable loan made by Drake to Paciello, owner of Edgartown Mobil and Depot Corner. Plaintiffs say that it follows from this that Paciello as retailer would agree to whatever Drake, wearing its retailer hat, wanted. The defendants say there was a legitimate business rationale. This was a loan from Drake as a wholesaler trying to keep a significant customer in business so that Drake's wholesale business would not diminish and would thrive. This also explains the favorable loan rates. In any event, it is not reasonable to infer from this that what Drake wanted was an illegal agreement to fix prices and that Paciello did so agree. Paciello might be rendered more pliable, but the loan evidence does not advance the likelihood of a tacit or express agreement.</p>\n<p>The sum total of this evidence simply does not rise to the level <i>Matsushita</i> requires. Plaintiffs' ambiguous evidence is entirely consistent with permissible conscious parallelism. <i>See </i><i>Matsushita,</i> 475 U.S. at 588, 106 S.Ct. 1348. Plaintiffs have failed to produce evidence that \"tends to exclude the possibility of independent action.\" <i>Monsanto,</i> 465 U.S. at 768, 104 S.Ct. 1464.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs' final argument is that the district court improperly disregarded their expert's report, including his conclusion that defendants' \"cost trends and coincident defendant pricing patterns are inconsistent with independent, non-cooperative behavior.\" The district court expressly adopted the expert's conclusions about the price and cost disparities between Martha's Vineyard and Cape Cod gas stations, and cited the expert's conclusions about the ambiguity of plaintiffs' market structure evidence. It is clear from the district court's opinion that it did not disregard the report, and the report does not undermine the conclusion that plaintiffs have failed to show that an agreement among the defendants is a more likely explanation for their pricing behaviors than bare conscious parallelism.</p>\n<p>The expert acknowledged, \"The results of my investigations are mixed,\" explaining that plaintiffs' economic evidence includes \"instances that ... are not inconsistent with either cooperative or non-cooperative behavior\" and other instances that are inconsistent with \"independent, non-cooperative behavior.\" The report further acknowledged that defendants' decisions to increase prices as their costs declined, instead of undercutting other stations' prices, make no business sense \"<i>unless you know your rivals will follow,</i>\" (emphasis added)as they will, in conscious parallelism, in an interdependent oligopoly market.</p>\n<p>As this court has said, \"A firm in a concentrated industry typically has reason to decide (individually) to copy an industry leader. After all, a higher-than-leader's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*586</span> price might lead a customer to buy elsewhere, while a lower-than-leader's price might simply lead competitors to match the lower price, reducing profits for all. One does not need an agreement to bring about this kind of follow-the-leader effect in a concentrated industry.\" <i>Clamp-All Corp.,</i> 851 F.2d at 484.</p>\n<p>The antitrust claims fail.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Price-Gouging Claim</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Massachusetts regulatory law prohibits selling gasoline at unconscionably high prices during market emergencies. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A § 2(a), (c); 940 Mass.Code Regs. 3.18. The district court entered summary judgment against plaintiffs' state law claims that the defendants engaged in price-gouging in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005.</p>\n<p>The rule states,</p>\n<blockquote>(1) It shall be an unfair or deceptive act or practice, during any market emergency, for any petroleum-related business to sell or offer to sell any petroleum product for an amount that represents an unconscionably high price.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) A price is unconscionably high if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(a) the amount charged represents a gross disparity between the price of the petroleum product and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>1. the price at which the same product was sold or offered for sale by the petroleum-related business in the usual course of business immediately prior to the onset of the market emergency, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>2. the price at which the same or similar petroleum product is readily obtainable by other buyers in the trade area; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(b) the disparity is not substantially attributable to increased prices charged by the petroleum-related business suppliers or increased costs due to an abnormal market disruption.</blockquote>\n<p>Defendants have conceded for the purpose of their motions for summary judgment that a market emergency<sup>[10]</sup> began on August 29, 2005, the day Hurricane Katrina made landfall in the United States, continued through the period following Hurricane Rita, which made landfall on September 24, and ended on December 1, 2005.<sup>[11]</sup> The regulation defines neither \"gross disparity\" nor \"immediately prior.\" Significantly, there have been no Massachusetts state court decisions interpreting the rule. Like the district court we write on a clean slate.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p>Plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in rejecting their interpretation that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*587</span> a \"gross disparity\" can be proven from a change in profit as well as from a change in retail price. The district court used a \"plain language\" interpretation that because the regulation defines when \"[a] price is unconscionably high,\" 940 Mass. Code Regs. 3.18(2), the analysis turns on disparities among prices at differing times and places. Absent such a showing about prices, the district court held, high profit margins cannot prove unconscionability of prices.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs argue that section 2 of the regulation provides only a nonexclusive method of proving that prices are unconscionably high, and that section 2(b) contemplates examination of gross margins (as a proxy for profit margins). They also argue that the regulation, whatever its language, must be interpreted to be consistent with the Federal Trade Commission's interpretations of different price-gouging definitions, because the Massachusetts state courts refer to certain FTC interpretations when interpreting Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, the statute underlying the price-gouging regulation.<sup>[13]</sup><i>See </i><i>Ciardi v. F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Ltd.,</i> 436 Mass. 53, 762 N.E.2d 303, 309 (2002).</p>\n<p>The facts about prices during this period are not disputed. Plaintiffs summarize their evidence as showing that from August 30, the day after Katrina made landfall, to the end of the emergency period, the absolute maximum increase in defendants' gross margin per gallon of regular gas ranged from 36 to 51 cents, representing 38% to 68% increases. Using less volatile monthly averages, plaintiffs' Exhibit 13 shows maximum increases in gross margins during the market emergency of 25 cents or 38% at R.M. Packer's Tisbury Shell, 35 cents or 69% at Drake's Xtra-Mart Citgo, 31 cents or 51% at Paciello's Edgartown Mobil, and 31 cents or 54% at Depot Corner. Tisbury Shell's maximum margin was in November; the other three stations' were in October.</p>\n<p>Focusing on absolute changes in price per gallon from the week before to the week following Hurricane Katrina's August 29 landfall, prices rose 20 cents at Tisbury Shell, 48 cents at XtraMart Citgo, 42 cents at Edgartown Mobil, and 42 cents at Depot Corner. Prices continued to rise, to a maximum increase in early September of 37 cents at Tisbury Shell<sup>[14]</sup> and 60 cents at XtraMart Citgo,<sup>[15]</sup> Edgartown Mobil,<sup>[16]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*588</span> and Depot Corner.<sup>[17]</sup> During the week beginning on September 27, just after Hurricane Rita made landfall on September 24, prices were still above their August 22-28 pre-Katrina levels by 32 cents at Tisbury Shell, 42 cents at XtraMart Citgo, and 35 cents at both Edgartown Mobil and Depot Corner.</p>\n<p>The language of the price-gouging regulation does not reach gross disparities in price alone. The regulation is concerned with increases in both price and cost, the two factors that determine gross margin. We need not address the separate issue of whether a gross disparity between pre-emergency and post-emergency gross margins might make out a claim of price-gouging where an increase in absolute price does not in itself appear unconscionable. <i>See, e.g., People ex rel. Spitzer v. My Serv. Ctr., Inc.,</i> No. 06-21157, 2007 WL 102463, at *2 (N.Y.Sup.Ct. Jan. 17, 2007) (using increase in gross margin from 67 to 99 cents to illustrate that price increase of about 32 cents was price-gouging under New York law); <i>People ex rel. Spitzer v. Wever Petroleum, Inc.,</i> 14 Misc.3d 491, 827 N.Y.S.2d 813, 816 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.2006) (finding increase of 60 cents in gross margin made increase of 87 cents in price \"unconscionably excessive\" under New York law).</p>\n<p>The rule encompasses price and margin increases in relation to one another. Dramatic changes in gross margin might illustrate that a price increase is a \"gross disparity\" in price because it reflects price increases unexplained by cost increases. But nothing in the regulation suggests that increases in gross margin alone, in the absence of any price increase and simultaneous with <i>declining</i> retail prices, can support a price-gouging claim.</p>\n<p>While there is no specific history available as to the Massachusetts price-gouging rule, such rules are generally designed to protect consumers from acute and unconscionable increases in the prices they must pay for basic consumer goods during times of market emergency, not to mandate that retailers <i>decrease</i> their prices as quickly as their costs decline after the most acute crisis in supply of the good has passed. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Ark.Code Ann. § 4-88-301 (declaring legislative purpose to prevent \"excessive and unjustified increases\" in prices); Cal.Penal Code § 396 (\"It is the intent of the Legislature ... to protect citizens from excessive and unjustified increases in the prices charged. ...\"). These are not regulations meant to give the government control over the setting of petroleum product prices.</p>\n<p>The facts show that while defendants' average weekly prices were increasing, during the time periods of August 30-September 5 and September 6-12, their gross margins were generally rising only very moderately, since their costs were climbing as well.<sup>[18]</sup> Average margins rose at Tisbury Shell from 74 cents during the August 22-28 period to 78 cents from August 30-September 5, before dropping back down to 61 cents the following week. During the same time periods, margins at XtraMart rose from 53 cents to 87 cents <span class=\"star-pagination\">*589</span> before falling back to 68 cents, margins at Edgartown Mobil rose from 66 cents to 68 cents and then to 76 cents, and margins at Depot Corner rose from 62 cents to 64 cents and then to 72 cents.</p>\n<p>There is marked volatility in the margins, best shown by the swing in average gross margin at XtraMart Citgo from 53 cents during the week before Katrina to 87 cents during the first week after, but dropping back to 68 cents one week later as its costs continued to rise. This volatility resulted from mismatches between when the stations raised their prices and when they had to pay higher costs at wholesale.<sup>[19]</sup> At XtraMart, for example, prices rose from $3.50 on September 1 to $3.70 a gallon on September 2, when costs were $2.47 a gallon, but there was no further increase in price at XtraMart after costs rose to $3.15 a gallon on September 5. And the initial twenty-cent price increase to $3.70 a gallon itself came two days after a short-lived but sharp increase in XtraMart's costs from $2.56 to $2.93 per gallon, before costs dropped to $2.47 on September 2. Unless the resulting prices are \"unconscionably high,\" the price-gouging rule does not prohibit retailers from raising their prices in reasonable anticipation of future increases in costs, or after the fact in response to actual recent increases even if costs have dropped back down again.</p>\n<p>Defendants' margins hit their highest levels after their retail prices began to decline. It appears that the stations' costs dropped precipitously beginning in mid-September, but that they dropped their prices at a much slower rate. The stations' average weekly gross margins thus began a general rise from the week of September 13 well into October and November. But no station raised its price after September 7, and all four had dropped from their highest price by September 20 at the very latest.</p>\n<p>Neither the absolute increases in price nor the increases in gross margins show any \"gross disparity\" in price. As we have mentioned, no Massachusetts law defines \"gross disparity\" for the purposes of the price-gouging regulation. By analogy, however, in the context of unconscionable contracts, a Massachusetts case does refer to a \"gross disparity\" as requiring \"gross inadequacy of consideration.\" <i>Waters v. Min Ltd.,</i> 412 Mass. 64, 587 N.E.2d 231, 234 (1992) (quoting 1 A. Corbin, Contracts § 128, at 551 (1963 &amp; Supp. 1991)). That court said the disparity must \"lead[] inevitably to the felt conclusion that knowing advantage was taken\" of consumers. <i>Id.</i> at 233 (quoting <i>Jones v. Star Credit Corp.,</i> 59 Misc.2d 189, 298 N.Y.S.2d 264 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.1969)). Those standards have not been met here.</p>\n<p>The Federal Trade Commission report on which plaintiffs rely would not lead us to a different result, and so we do not decide what, if any, deference the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court would give it. <i>See</i> Federal Trade Commission, <i>Investigation of Gasoline Price Manipulation and Post-Katrina Gasoline Price Increases</i> (2006). Plaintiffs cite the FTC's statement that an increase in average margin of more than five cents is \"a price increase that was not substantially explained by increased costs.\" <i>Id.</i> at 151. But they incorrectly state that the FTC equated this five-cent margin increase with price-gouging. In fact, the FTC Report required an additional conclusionthat a retailer's absolute price increase exceeded <span class=\"star-pagination\">*590</span> the national average increase of thirty-five cents, as well as the average increase in the station's local area, by at least five centsbefore it was considered to have engaged in price-gouging. <i>Id.</i> at 152. Under plaintiffs' expert's definition of Cape Cod as the relevant \"trade area\" under the Massachusetts price-gouging rule, none of defendants' gas stations were price-gouging under the FTC's methodology: average gas prices on the Cape increased by 53 cents from August to September, while defendants' average gas prices increased between 42 and 54 cents.<sup>[20]</sup></p>\n<p>Plaintiffs have not shown a \"gross disparity\" in prices under the state price-gouging rule, even taking into account defendants' gross margins during the period of price increases.</p>\n<p>The only question before us is whether the supracompetitive prices charged by defendants on Martha's Vineyard are a result of illegal actions in violation of federal antitrust laws or state anti-price-gouging rules. Plaintiffs have failed to meet the legal standards for proof of those violations. The judgment of the district court is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  15 U.S.C. § 1 criminalizes anticompetitive agreements and specifies criminal penalties, and 15 U.S.C. § 15(a) provides a private right of action with treble damages for any violation of the antitrust laws.</p>\n<p>[2]  Section 2 of the Sherman Act does reach independent behavior, but only where a person \"shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize,\" a market. 15 U.S.C. § 2. That section is not invoked here.</p>\n<p>[3]  Conscious parallelism has also been called \"tacit collusion\" or \"oligopolistic price coordination.\" <i>See </i><i>Brooke Grp. Ltd. v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.,</i> 509 U.S. 209, 227, 113 S.Ct. 2578, 125 L.Ed.2d 168 (1993). Defendants' assertion that \"[a] merely tacit agreement is not an antitrust violation\" conflates the concepts of \"tacit collusion,\" referring to bare conscious parallelism, and \"tacit agreement,\" which <i>can</i> be reached under § 1, and which plaintiffs allege is in play in this case. <i>See </i><i>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly,</i> 550 U.S. 544, 553, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (distinguishing mere conscious parallelism from \"an agreement, tacit or express\") (quoting <i>Theatre Enters., Inc. v.

By contrast to a competitive market, in which no single producer has the power to affect the market price, in an oligopolistic market each of the major sellers can affect the market price by changing its output. By contrast to a monopolized market, \"no one firm can unilaterally determine market price by varying its output\" because rivals are large enough to affect the market price by doing the same. <i>Id.</i> at 10. As a result, \"the distinctive characteristic of oligopoly is recognized interdependence among the leading firms: the profit-maximizing choice of price and output for one depends on the choices made by others.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>[5]  In <i>Euromodas, Inc. v.

It is clear from the court's opinion that it did not require any particular category of evidence.</p>\n<p>[9]  The witnesses observed that Ahern seemed offended by the idea that such a discount would be a necessary condition to secure a permit. He did not feel it was right.</p>\n<p>[10]  A \"market emergency\" is defined as \"[a]ny abnormal disruption of any market for petroleum products, including but not limited to any actual or threatened shortage in the supply... or ... increase in the price,\" resulting from natural disaster, energy failure, war, national or local emergency, or other extraordinary circumstances. 940 Mass.Code Regs. 3.01.</p>\n<p>[11]  Whether this is the proper duration of any market emergency that occurred is not before us. We only note that the rapid decline in defendants' costs beginning in mid-September may indicate that any market emergency was no longer in place. <i>See</i> 940 Mass.Code Regs. 3.01 (defining \"market emergency\").</p>\n<p>[12]  On appeal, plaintiffs ask the court to certify the question of the interpretation of the price-gouging regulation to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. <i>See</i> Mass.

In any event, particularly because plaintiffs' case fails even under the interpretation they put forth, we exercise our discretion to decide the question ourselves, declining to certify it. <i>See </i><i>Boston Gas Co. v.

Moreover, the Massachusetts Attorney General has promulgated a specific rule defining price-gouging for purposes of Chapter 93A.</p>\n<p>[14]  Tisbury's high price, held from September 7 to at least September 18, was $3.57, 37 cents more than its August 22-28 average price of $3.20.</p>\n<p>[15]  XtraMart Citgo's high price, held from September 2-18, was $3.70, 60 cents more than its constant August 22-28 price of $3.10.</p>\n<p>[16]  Edgartown Mobil's high price, held from September 3 to at least September 5, was $3.89, 60 cents more than its constant August 22-28 price of $3.29.</p>\n<p>[17]  Depot Corner's high price, held from September 3-8, was $3.85, 60 cents more than its constant August 22-28 price of $3.25.</p>\n<p>[18]  To calculate average weekly prices, costs, and margins, the data used was from plaintiffs' Exhibit 11, which provided daily price and cost data for all four defendants from July 15 through November 7, 2005.

As to the antitrust claims, the stations agree for the purposes of summary judgment that there is evidence of parallel pricing but say that is not illegal absent an agreement to fix prices. The district court granted summary judgment to defendants on both of plaintiffs' claims, which were brought under § 1 of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act and a price-gouging regulation under Mass. Gen.

This is the common understanding and plaintiffs do not disagree.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Factual and Procedural Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The underlying facts of the case, including the district court's description of the retail gasoline market on Martha's Vineyard, are undisputed.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs are summer and year-round residents of Martha's Vineyard and an island real estate agency. Defendants operate four of the nine gas stations on Martha's Vineyard. In Edgartown, individual defendant Francis Paciello owns the Edgartown Mobil station. The defendant corporation Depot Corner, Inc., which is wholly owned by Paciello, owns the Depot Corner station, also in Edgartown. In Vineyard Haven, about seven miles northwest of Edgartown, defendant corporation Drake/Kenyon (Drake)<sup>[6]</sup> owns the Xtra-Mart Citgo station in Vineyard Haven and also supplies gasoline to the Edgartown stations at wholesale. Defendant corporation R.M. Packer, also in Vineyard Haven, owns the Tisbury Shell gas station; R.M. Packer is owned by the individuals Ralph Packer and his wife.</p>\n<p>Of the other five gas stations on the island, two are in Oak Bluffs, about three miles from Vineyard Haven, one is in Edgartown, and two are on the western part of the island in West Tisbury and Chilmark.</p>\n<p>The defendants' prices exceeded prices at gas stations on Cape Cod by an average of fifty-six cents per gallon during a five year period beginning on August 1, 2003, according to calculations performed by plaintiffs' expert and cited by the district court. Twenty-one cents of that difference is attributable to the higher costs of transporting gas to the island than to the mainland Cape.</p>\n<p>The retail gasoline market on Martha's Vineyard has features that make it susceptible to efforts by gas stations to sustain supracompetitive prices. These features would facilitate both conspiratorial pricing and merely interdependent parallel pricing for several reasons. <i>See</i> 2B Areeda, Hovenkamp, &amp; Solow, <i>supra,</i> ¶ 404, at 9-20.</p>\n<p>First, would-be competitors attracted to the market by high profit margins face a regulatory barrier to entry: they need permission from the Martha's Vineyard Commission. The Commission has denied all petitions to open new gas stations since 1997. This, along with their location on a relatively small island, insulates the current stations from competition.</p>\n<p>Second, customer demand for gasoline on an island is inelastic, meaning customers will not buy much less gas when prices rise, because they cannot choose to drive farther away to get cheaper gas. Gasoline in general is a nondurable good, so that customers have to buy it frequently and are not likely to simply stay out of the market until prices drop. This is particularly true for customers who are summer residents and are in the market for only limited periods of time.</p>\n<p>Third, gasoline is a homogeneous good, so consumers decide where to buy it based mostly on price and convenience, leading competing gas stations to prominently post prices. This posting also lets competitors know and respond in real time to one another's prices, allowing them to catch price \"cheaters\" and to follow price \"leaders.\" <i>See id.</i> ¶ 404b3, at 14-15 (describing cheating); 6 Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp, <i>supra,</i> ¶ 1430d, at 226 (describing leading); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Heffernan,</i> 43 F.3d <span class=\"star-pagination\">*579</span> 1144, 1149 (7th Cir.1994) (describing catching price cheaters). Since there are only nine gas stations on the entire island, each station can easily monitor and respond to the prices of the others. If one station drops its price in order to attract more business, the others can quickly drop their prices in response. The original \"cheater\" benefits very little from undercutting its competitors' prices, because when any one of them drops its prices the competitors can match the price before many customers respond to the incentive. And all of the stations suffer a decrease in profit margin.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a station acting as a price \"leader\" risks little by raising its price under such market conditions. Other stations are likely to follow, given the possibility of higher prices and profit margins for all. If for some reason the competitors do not follow the increases, the leader can easily drop its price again to match the other stations so quickly that few customers are lost to lower-priced competition. Knowing these features of the market, each gas station owner is likely to reach its own independent conclusion that its best interests involve keeping prices high, including following price changes by a price \"leader\" (if one emerges), in confidence that the other station owners will reach the same independent conclusion. Here there is no evidence or suggestion that the business risk to any station on Martha's Vineyard of raising its prices was so great as to require communication among stations before any one of them would venture it.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs, angered by what they saw as unjustifiably high prices at the pump, brought suit in Massachusetts Superior Court on August 2, 2007 alleging that defendants had conspired to fix retail gas prices since at least December 31, 1999. Defendants removed the case to federal court on August 28, 2007,<sup>[7]</sup> after which plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, substituting Sherman Anti-Trust Act price-fixing allegations or their original Massachusetts Antitrust Act allegations. Due to the Sherman Act's four-year statute of limitations, 15 U.S.C. § 15b, the district court limited plaintiffs' price-fixing claim to violations occurring on or after August 2, 2003. The district court allowed discovery, but denied the parties' joint requests for discovery of detailed sales and financial data from other Martha's Vineyard gas stations not named in the suit. Following a June 24, 2009, hearing on defendants' motions for summary judgment, the district court granted defendants' motions on January 6, 2010.</p>\n<p>Although our review is de novo, we describe the district court's thoughtful analysis. The district court reasoned that most of the evidence the plaintiffs proffered was no more consistent with conspiracy than with independent choices to engage in parallel pricing. The district court found other evidence not sufficiently probative of conspiracy. First, the district court found that Drake's employment of a consultant to lobby the Martha's Vineyard Commission to deny petitions for new gas stations was \"conduct that would be expected even in a competitive gasoline retail market.\" <i>White v. R.M. Packer Co.,</i> No. 07-11601, slip op. at 6 n. 5 (D.Mass. Jan. 6, 2010). Second, the district court found too attenuated the evidence that two of the defendants communicated with one another about prices in 1999 because the communications concerned the wholesale, rather than retail, market and occurred years <span class=\"star-pagination\">*580</span> before the period covered by the limitations period. The district court found it troubling that an unusually generous loan from Drake to Paciello may have provided Paciello with an incentive to conspire with Drake, but held that this was not enough to permit a reasonable jury to find an agreement to fix prices.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Merits of Plaintiffs' Appeal from Entry of Summary Judgment</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs argue that the district court erred by (1) applying the wrong legal standard, (2) considering their evidence of plus factors piecemeal rather than as a whole, and (3) ignoring their expert evidence.</p>\n<p>First, plaintiffs argue that the district court, despite correctly stating the legal standard to which it held plaintiffs' evidence, proceeded in fact as if plaintiffs are required to \"exclude,\" rather than \"tend to exclude,\" the possibility of independent action. <i>See </i><i>Matsushita,</i> 475 U.S. at 588, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111620\"><a href=\"/opinion/111620/matsushita-electric-industrial-co-ltd-v-zenith-radio-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1348</span></a></span>. Having reviewed the entire record, we disagree. Nothing in the district court's opinion suggests that the court required plaintiffs to produce direct evidence of conspiracy as plaintiffs claim.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>Plaintiffs also argue that defendants' concession for summary judgment purposes that there has been parallel pricing \"gets plaintiffs close to defeating summary judgment\" because of the statement in <i>Twombly</i> that \"[a]n allegation of parallel conduct ... gets [a] <i>complaint</i> close to stating a claim\" for purposes of surviving an initial <i>motion to dismiss. </i><i>Twombly,</i> 550 U.S. at 557, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145730\"><a href=\"/opinion/145730/bell-atlantic-corp-v-twombly/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1955</span></a></span> (emphasis added). As a statement of the law at summary judgment, plaintiffs are flatly wrong. Mere parallelism, whether stipulated or proven, does not even create a prima facie conspiracy case. <i>See </i><i>Brooke Grp.,</i> 509 U.S. at 227, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112893\"><a href=\"/opinion/112893/brooke-group-ltd-v-brown-williamson-tobacco-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2578</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>Much of the evidence plaintiffs offer as \"plus factors,\" even when viewed in the light most favorable to them, does no more than corroborate that the Martha's Vineyard gasoline market is an oligopolistic market which is highly conducive to parallel pricing. The evidence does nothing to explain whether the parallel pricing was achieved by agreement or mere interdependent decisions. Plaintiffs' remaining evidence does not \"`tend[] to exclude the possibility' that the alleged conspirators acted independently,\" and so is not enough to permit a reasonable inference that defendants' behavior was more than mere conscious parallelism. <i>Matsushita,</i> 475 U.S. at 588, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111620\"><a href=\"/opinion/111620/matsushita-electric-industrial-co-ltd-v-zenith-radio-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

(distinguishing \"evidence of noncompetitive behavior\" from \"evidence that the structure of the market was conducive to such behavior\").</p>\n<p>We have considered the totality of plaintiffs' evidence, as did the district court, and discuss the inadequacy of the parts as well as of the whole. Six of plaintiffs' nine plus factors show nothing more than that the gasoline market on Martha's Vineyard is conducive to conscious parallelism. We begin with two that describe defendants' pricing behavior. First, during three periods in 2004 and 2005 the defendants, in parallel, held prices steady or raised them while the cost of gasoline at wholesale declined. Second, defendants have enjoyed what plaintiffs call \"abnormal profits.\" It is true, as plaintiffs state, that changes in pricing patterns and profit levels may be useful in identifying the <i>beginning</i> of a conspiracy, immediately after which conspirators may successfully raise prices without reference to costs. <i>See</i> Posner, <i>supra,</i> at 88, 90; <i>see also </i><i>Text Messaging,</i> 630 F.3d at 628 (stating that in a competitive market \"falling costs ... motivat[e a seller], in the absence of agreement, to reduce his price slightly in order to take business from his competitors\").</p>\n<p>However, these pricing behaviors do not function as \"plus factors\" when they are stable over time, because that factual context undermines any inference that the pricing behavior represents a sudden shift marking the <i>beginning</i> of a price-fixing conspiracy. Here, plaintiffs allege a price-fixing conspiracy dating back \"at least as early as December 31, 1999\"; there is no suggestion that defendants' behavior changed in 2004, in 2005, or at any other relevant time. In this factual context, evidence that defendants set supracompetitive prices that did not decline when their costs declined shows no more than that they made their pricing decisions in an oligopolistic, rather than competitive, market.</p>\n<p>Other evidence also undermines plaintiffs' arguments about defendants' pricing behaviors. Plaintiffs' own expert stated that \"[n]o unambiguous conclusion ... can be gleaned from [defendants'] pattern of parallel pricing,\" and that he could \"draw no behavioral conclusion\" from the divergence between the defendants' declining costs and retail prices, since it could \"be the result of a supra-competitive price umbrella.\" Further, the expert did not explain whether in his opinion such an \"umbrella\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*582</span> would even require agreement. Similarly ambiguous is deposition testimony as to three of the four stations, by the principals of defendants Drake and Depot Corner, Inc., that they did not know what margin over cost they needed to charge to turn a profit. Plaintiffs argue that without a price agreement such ignorance would be \"suicidal,\" but the testimony equally supports the inference that stations' pricing decisions in this market are not based, as they would be in a competitive market, on cost, but rather on the actions and expected actions of other stations.</p>\n<p>A third plus factor offered by plaintiffs is that defendants had \"motive to conspire\" because cooperating with one another could allow them to earn supracompetitive profits. Taking as a given that all of the defendants had motive to conspire with one another to earn high profits, all such a motive shows is that the defendants could reasonably expect to earn higher profits by keeping prices at a supracompetitive level through parallel pricing practices. <i>Matsushita</i> states that evidence showing defendants have \"a plausible reason to conspire\" does not create a triable issue as to whether there was a conspiracy. <i>Matsushita,</i> 475 U.S. at 596-97 &amp; n. 21, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111620\"><a href=\"/opinion/111620/matsushita-electric-industrial-co-ltd-v-zenith-radio-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1348</span></a></span>; 6 Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp, <i>supra,</i> ¶ 1434(c)(1), at 269 (\"Motivation is thus synonymous with interdependence and therefore adds nothing to it.\"). We take up later the issue of whether a $2 million loan at a below-market interest rate from Drake to Paciello, when Paciello could not obtain a loan from other lenders, gave Paciello motive to \"do Drake's bidding regarding keeping up gas prices\" as plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p>Three other plus factors plaintiffs allege are that the Martha's Vineyard retail gasoline market (1) is insulated by high barriers to entry, thanks to the Martha's Vineyard Commission's demonstrated gatekeeping power, (2) faces highly inelastic demand for gasoline, and (3) is marked by stable relative market shares over time among the four defendants. High barriers to entry and inelastic demand are two hallmarks of oligopolistic markets susceptible to successful parallel pricing practices, but neither helps to distinguish between agreement and mere conscious parallelism as the root cause of those practices. \"[W]ithout barriers to entry it would presumably be impossible to maintain supracompetitive prices. ...\" <i>Matsushita,</i> 475 U.S. at 591 n. 15, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111620\"><a href=\"/opinion/111620/matsushita-electric-industrial-co-ltd-v-zenith-radio-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Philip Morris USA,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"76309\"><a href=\"/opinion/76309/williamson-oil-company-inc-v-philip-morris-usa/\"><span class=\"volume\">346</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1287</span></a></span>, 1317 (11th Cir.2003) (describing high barriers to entry and inelastic demand as two indicia of oligopoly). And while stable market shares over time may suggest in some factual contexts that the firms \"eliminated competition[] among themselves,\" Posner, <i>supra,</i> at 79, it is also likely that conscious parallelism would be sufficient to maintain stable relative market shares in a stable market for a basic commodity protected from new entry. The district court specifically cited plaintiffs' expert's acknowledgment that the \"nearly constant market shares are consistent with both cooperative and non-cooperative pricing behavior.\" <i>See White,</i> slip op. at 6.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs' seventh factor is that variations in price from region to region may indicate collusion. This may be true on some facts. <i>See</i> Posner, <i>supra,</i> at 87. But plaintiffs err in pointing to the difference in gas prices between Cape Cod and Martha's Vineyard. Even discounting the higher transportation costs of getting fuel to the island gas stations, we have already discussed a number of lawful reasons why the island stations are likely to be able to maintain the rest of the variation in price without agreement.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*583</span> Plaintiffs' eighth purported plus factor is that Drake's employment of a consultant to lobby the Martha's Vineyard Commission to deny a petition for a new gas station on the island proves that Drake \"was willing to act secretly to influence gas prices.\" Drake's unilateral retention of a consultant was a legitimate exercise of its right to petition. There is no claim that the consultant or the Commission acted illegally. In addition, this was entirely economically rational behavior, whatever the Commission decided. Indeed, these actions are well within those actions which the Supreme Court sought to protect from chilling effects. <i>See </i><i>Monsanto,</i> 465 U.S. at 763, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111115\"><a href=\"/opinion/111115/monsanto-co-v-spray-rite-service-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1464</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>Other pieces of evidence require further examination and we consider them the strongest evidence plaintiffs have advanced. Plaintiffs produced some evidence that two of the defendants' principals communicated with one another and may have been untruthful about the communication. This fits with a different type of plus factor: \"traditional\" conspiracy evidence of the type that helps to distinguish between conscious parallelism and collusion and that is necessary to an inference of agreement. <i>Flat Glass,</i> 385 F.3d at 362; 6 Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp, <i>supra,</i> ¶ 1434b, at 267. This need not be direct evidence; circumstantial evidence can suffice to establish an antitrust conspiracy. <i>Monsanto,</i> 465 U.S. at 764, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111115\"><a href=\"/opinion/111115/monsanto-co-v-spray-rite-service-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1464</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>Two witnesses recalled meetings held ten years earlier, in December 1999, with Jim Ahern of defendant Drake about contracting with Drake to be the wholesale gas supplier for a new gas station they were trying to open on the island. At the first meeting, the two described a ten-cent retail price discount for year-round Vine-yard residents that they proposed to offer in order to convince the Martha's Vineyard Commission to approve their permit. Ahern replied that he would not give year-round residents a discount.<sup>[9]</sup> Then, referring to Ralph Packer, whose company R.M. Packer was the owner of Tisbury Shell, Ahern made the point that businesses on the Vineyard were also not inclined to give discounts, saying, \"Your boy Ralph Packer, an island boy, is not cutting people any slack, and I'm not going to either.\" It is not clear from the record whether Ahern was speaking as a wholesaler or retailer in refusing to contemplate a discount, since both his company and Ralph Packer's company, R.M. Packer, played both wholesaler and retailer roles on Martha's Vineyard. R.M. Packer supplied other stations on the island that are not defendants. Drake supplied the two defendant stations owned by Paciello, but also was a wholesaler to a number of stations elsewhere on the East Coast.</p>\n<p>At the second meeting, during a discussion between the two witnesses and Ahern about the discount, when the subject of Ralph Packer arose Ahern said, \"You know we talk.\" Ahern then called on speakerphone a person whom Ahern said was Packer. It appeared to the witnesses that the call's recipient recognized Ahern's voice without Ahern identifying himself. We assume, in plaintiffs' favor, that the call recipient was Packer. Ahern casually stated to Packer that he was just checking in, and hung up after a friendly, general conversation of under five minutes. Ahern and Packer did not discuss the witnesses' desire to open a station, pricing or other business. One witness said he thought Ahern made the call \"to demonstrate ... that it didn't really matter who we chose as a distributor, we'd have the same wholesale <span class=\"star-pagination\">*584</span> price.\" The witness also said that after this conversation, Ahern told them, \"we all work together,\" and said, \"I talk to Packer frequently.\"</p>\n<p>Yet Ahern said in a 2009 deposition that he did not recall talking to Ralph Packer on the phone and only had one business meeting with him. Packer, in a 2008 deposition, said he met once with Ahern about wholesale supply about fifteen years earlier and had no phone conversations with him. In context, even if Ahern's and Packer's denials that they spoke over the phone were untrue, Ahern's actions and statements demonstrated at most a wholesaler's attempt to show his leverage over a potential wholesale customer, and are vague, ambiguous, and non-probative with regard to retail pricing practices.</p>\n<p>There was more evidence about that meeting. One of the witnesses seeking permission to open a new station stated his view that if the new station were to offer gasoline at a lower price, there would be a chain reaction and the other stations would also lower their prices. In response to conjecture on what would happen if the two Paciello stations supplied by Ahern's company, Drake, started dropping their prices, Ahern replied, \"if they start mucking around with prices one or two delivery trucks a week might not make it on the boat and they'll get the idea real quick.\" The witness \"didn't really get the feeling... that it was a threat.\" This statement, in any event, was about unilateral action by Drake against one of its wholesale customers. It suggests competition between Drake's retail station and its wholesale customers' retail stations, not collusion among retailers.</p>\n<p>Drake's and R.M. Packer's dual status as both wholesalers and retailers is thus relevant to understanding why the evidence from these meetings does not suffice to raise an inference of an agreement to fix prices <i>in the retail market.</i> Nothing forbids producers from selling in two different levels of the same market, here the wholesale and retail levels. <i>Cf. </i><i>Texaco Inc. v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">623</span></a></span> (2007). Nor have plaintiffs argued that Drake and R.M. Packer agreed to fix wholesale prices.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs also point to doubts about Packer's testimony that Tisbury Shell's profits were less than $100,000 a year and that there had not been any dividends for more than a decade from the R.M. Packer Company to Packer and his wife, the sole shareholders. Plaintiffs produced evidence that the R.M. Packer Company, in which Tisbury Shell accounted for about 40% of the revenues, had profits of more than $800,000 a year, and that Packer and his wife had received more than <span class=\"star-pagination\">*585</span> $950,000 in dividends from the company from 2003 to 2007. The apparent inaccuracies in Packer's deposition testimony are concerning, but the reason for them is unclear. At most there are inferences, which include Packer's confusion about the structure of his business and the lack of separate financial statements for Tisbury Shell's portion of the overall R.M. Packer company. The inaccuracies, though, more importantly, are not about whether there was an illegal agreement, but only about the amount of profits. Whatever their cause, these statements do not support any inference of conspiracy. Plaintiffs themselves concede that such \"`pretext' standing alone is not sufficient to show joint action,\" but can only strengthen an inference of joint action that is otherwise in evidence. <i>See </i><i>DeLong Equip. Co. v. Washington Mills Abrasive Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"531048\"><a href=\"/opinion/531048/delong-equipment-company-v-washington-mills-abrasive-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">887</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1499</span></a></span>, 1514 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs have evidence of a highly favorable loan made by Drake to Paciello, owner of Edgartown Mobil and Depot Corner. Plaintiffs say that it follows from this that Paciello as retailer would agree to whatever Drake, wearing its retailer hat, wanted. The defendants say there was a legitimate business rationale. This was a loan from Drake as a wholesaler trying to keep a significant customer in business so that Drake's wholesale business would not diminish and would thrive. This also explains the favorable loan rates. In any event, it is not reasonable to infer from this that what Drake wanted was an illegal agreement to fix prices and that Paciello did so agree. Paciello might be rendered more pliable, but the loan evidence does not advance the likelihood of a tacit or express agreement.</p>\n<p>The sum total of this evidence simply does not rise to the level <i>Matsushita</i> requires. Plaintiffs' ambiguous evidence is entirely consistent with permissible conscious parallelism. <i>See </i><i>Matsushita,</i> 475 U.S. at 588, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111620\"><a href=\"/opinion/111620/matsushita-electric-industrial-co-ltd-v-zenith-radio-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

It is clear from the district court's opinion that it did not disregard the report, and the report does not undermine the conclusion that plaintiffs have failed to show that an agreement among the defendants is a more likely explanation for their pricing behaviors than bare conscious parallelism.</p>\n<p>The expert acknowledged, \"The results of my investigations are mixed,\" explaining that plaintiffs' economic evidence includes \"instances that ... are not inconsistent with either cooperative or non-cooperative behavior\" and other instances that are inconsistent with \"independent, non-cooperative behavior.\" The report further acknowledged that defendants' decisions to increase prices as their costs declined, instead of undercutting other stations' prices, make no business sense \"<i>unless you know your rivals will follow,</i>\" (emphasis added)as they will, in conscious parallelism, in an interdependent oligopoly market.</p>\n<p>As this court has said, \"A firm in a concentrated industry typically has reason to decide (individually) to copy an industry leader. After all, a higher-than-leader's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*586</span> price might lead a customer to buy elsewhere, while a lower-than-leader's price might simply lead competitors to match the lower price, reducing profits for all.

Gen. Laws ch. 93A § 2(a), (c); 940 Mass.Code Regs. 3.18. The district court entered summary judgment against plaintiffs' state law claims that the defendants engaged in price-gouging in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005.</p>\n<p>The rule states,</p>\n<blockquote>(1) It shall be an unfair or deceptive act or practice, during any market emergency, for any petroleum-related business to sell or offer to sell any petroleum product for an amount that represents an unconscionably high price.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) A price is unconscionably high if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(a) the amount charged represents a gross disparity between the price of the petroleum product and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>1. the price at which the same product was sold or offered for sale by the petroleum-related business in the usual course of business immediately prior to the onset of the market emergency, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>2. the price at which the same or similar petroleum product is readily obtainable by other buyers in the trade area; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(b) the disparity is not substantially attributable to increased prices charged by the petroleum-related business suppliers or increased costs due to an abnormal market disruption.</blockquote>\n<p>Defendants have conceded for the purpose of their motions for summary judgment that a market emergency<sup>[10]</sup> began on August 29, 2005, the day Hurricane Katrina made landfall in the United States, continued through the period following Hurricane Rita, which made landfall on September 24, and ended on December 1, 2005.<sup>[11]</sup> The regulation defines neither \"gross disparity\" nor \"immediately prior.\" Significantly, there have been no Massachusetts state court decisions interpreting the rule. Like the district court we write on a clean slate.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p>Plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in rejecting their interpretation that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*587</span> a \"gross disparity\" can be proven from a change in profit as well as from a change in retail price. The district court used a \"plain language\" interpretation that because the regulation defines when \"[a] price is unconscionably high,\" 940 Mass. Code Regs. 3.18(2), the analysis turns on disparities among prices at differing times and places. Absent such a showing about prices, the district court held, high profit margins cannot prove unconscionability of prices.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs argue that section 2 of the regulation provides only a nonexclusive method of proving that prices are unconscionably high, and that section 2(b) contemplates examination of gross margins (as a proxy for profit margins). They also argue that the regulation, whatever its language, must be interpreted to be consistent with the Federal Trade Commission's interpretations of different price-gouging definitions, because the Massachusetts state courts refer to certain FTC interpretations when interpreting Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, the statute underlying the price-gouging regulation.<sup>[13]</sup><i>See </i><i>Ciardi v. F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Ltd.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">762</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">303</span></span>, 309 (2002).</p>\n<p>The facts about prices during this period are not disputed. Plaintiffs summarize their evidence as showing that from August 30, the day after Katrina made landfall, to the end of the emergency period, the absolute maximum increase in defendants' gross margin per gallon of regular gas ranged from 36 to 51 cents, representing 38% to 68% increases. Using less volatile monthly averages, plaintiffs' Exhibit 13 shows maximum increases in gross margins during the market emergency of 25 cents or 38% at R.M. Packer's Tisbury Shell, 35 cents or 69% at Drake's Xtra-Mart Citgo, 31 cents or 51% at Paciello's Edgartown Mobil, and 31 cents or 54% at Depot Corner. Tisbury Shell's maximum margin was in November; the other three stations' were in October.</p>\n<p>Focusing on absolute changes in price per gallon from the week before to the week following Hurricane Katrina's August 29 landfall, prices rose 20 cents at Tisbury Shell, 48 cents at XtraMart Citgo, 42 cents at Edgartown Mobil, and 42 cents at Depot Corner. Prices continued to rise, to a maximum increase in early September of 37 cents at Tisbury Shell<sup>[14]</sup> and 60 cents at XtraMart Citgo,<sup>[15]</sup> Edgartown Mobil,<sup>[16]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*588</span> and Depot Corner.<sup>[17]</sup> During the week beginning on September 27, just after Hurricane Rita made landfall on September 24, prices were still above their August 22-28 pre-Katrina levels by 32 cents at Tisbury Shell, 42 cents at XtraMart Citgo, and 35 cents at both Edgartown Mobil and Depot Corner.</p>\n<p>The language of the price-gouging regulation does not reach gross disparities in price alone. The regulation is concerned with increases in both price and cost, the two factors that determine gross margin. We need not address the separate issue of whether a gross disparity between pre-emergency and post-emergency gross margins might make out a claim of price-gouging where an increase in absolute price does not in itself appear unconscionable. <i>See, e.g., People ex rel.

Dramatic changes in gross margin might illustrate that a price increase is a \"gross disparity\" in price because it reflects price increases unexplained by cost increases. But nothing in the regulation suggests that increases in gross margin alone, in the absence of any price increase and simultaneous with <i>declining</i> retail prices, can support a price-gouging claim.</p>\n<p>While there is no specific history available as to the Massachusetts price-gouging rule, such rules are generally designed to protect consumers from acute and unconscionable increases in the prices they must pay for basic consumer goods during times of market emergency, not to mandate that retailers <i>decrease</i> their prices as quickly as their costs decline after the most acute crisis in supply of the good has passed. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Ark.Code Ann. § 4-88-301 (declaring legislative purpose to prevent \"excessive and unjustified increases\" in prices); Cal.Penal Code § 396 (\"It is the intent of the Legislature ... to protect citizens from excessive and unjustified increases in the prices charged. ...\"). These are not regulations meant to give the government control over the setting of petroleum product prices.</p>\n<p>The facts show that while defendants' average weekly prices were increasing, during the time periods of August 30-September 5 and September 6-12, their gross margins were generally rising only very moderately, since their costs were climbing as well.<sup>[18]</sup> Average margins rose at Tisbury Shell from 74 cents during the August 22-28 period to 78 cents from August 30-September 5, before dropping back down to 61 cents the following week. During the same time periods, margins at XtraMart rose from 53 cents to 87 cents <span class=\"star-pagination\">*589</span> before falling back to 68 cents, margins at Edgartown Mobil rose from 66 cents to 68 cents and then to 76 cents, and margins at Depot Corner rose from 62 cents to 64 cents and then to 72 cents.</p>\n<p>There is marked volatility in the margins, best shown by the swing in average gross margin at XtraMart Citgo from 53 cents during the week before Katrina to 87 cents during the first week after, but dropping back to 68 cents one week later as its costs continued to rise. This volatility resulted from mismatches between when the stations raised their prices and when they had to pay higher costs at wholesale.<sup>[19]</sup> At XtraMart, for example, prices rose from $3.50 on September 1 to $3.70 a gallon on September 2, when costs were $2.47 a gallon, but there was no further increase in price at XtraMart after costs rose to $3.15 a gallon on September 5. And the initial twenty-cent price increase to $3.70 a gallon itself came two days after a short-lived but sharp increase in XtraMart's costs from $2.56 to $2.93 per gallon, before costs dropped to $2.47 on September 2. Unless the resulting prices are \"unconscionably high,\" the price-gouging rule does not prohibit retailers from raising their prices in reasonable anticipation of future increases in costs, or after the fact in response to actual recent increases even if costs have dropped back down again.</p>\n<p>Defendants' margins hit their highest levels after their retail prices began to decline. It appears that the stations' costs dropped precipitously beginning in mid-September, but that they dropped their prices at a much slower rate. The stations' average weekly gross margins thus began a general rise from the week of September 13 well into October and November. But no station raised its price after September 7, and all four had dropped from their highest price by September 20 at the very latest.</p>\n<p>Neither the absolute increases in price nor the increases in gross margins show any \"gross disparity\" in price. As we have mentioned, no Massachusetts law defines \"gross disparity\" for the purposes of the price-gouging regulation. By analogy, however, in the context of unconscionable contracts, a Massachusetts case does refer to a \"gross disparity\" as requiring \"gross inadequacy of consideration.\" <i>Waters v.

Those standards have not been met here.</p>\n<p>The Federal Trade Commission report on which plaintiffs rely would not lead us to a different result, and so we do not decide what, if any, deference the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court would give it. <i>See</i> Federal Trade Commission, <i>Investigation of Gasoline Price Manipulation and Post-Katrina Gasoline Price Increases</i> (2006). Plaintiffs cite the FTC's statement that an increase in average margin of more than five cents is \"a price increase that was not substantially explained by increased costs.\" <i>Id.</i> at 151. But they incorrectly state that the FTC equated this five-cent margin increase with price-gouging. In fact, the FTC Report required an additional conclusionthat a retailer's absolute price increase exceeded <span class=\"star-pagination\">*590</span> the national average increase of thirty-five cents, as well as the average increase in the station's local area, by at least five centsbefore it was considered to have engaged in price-gouging. <i>Id.</i> at 152. Under plaintiffs' expert's definition of Cape Cod as the relevant \"trade area\" under the Massachusetts price-gouging rule, none of defendants' gas stations were price-gouging under the FTC's methodology: average gas prices on the Cape increased by 53 cents from August to September, while defendants' average gas prices increased between 42 and 54 cents.<sup>[20]</sup></p>\n<p>Plaintiffs have not shown a \"gross disparity\" in prices under the state price-gouging rule, even taking into account defendants' gross margins during the period of price increases.</p>\n<p>The only question before us is whether the supracompetitive prices charged by defendants on Martha's Vineyard are a result of illegal actions in violation of federal antitrust laws or state anti-price-gouging rules. Plaintiffs have failed to meet the legal standards for proof of those violations. The judgment of the district court is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  15 U.S.C. § 1 criminalizes anticompetitive agreements and specifies criminal penalties, and 15 U.S.C. § 15(a) provides a private right of action with treble damages for any violation of the antitrust laws.</p>\n<p>[2]  Section 2 of the Sherman Act does reach independent behavior, but only where a person \"shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize,\" a market. 15 U.S.C. § 2.

By contrast to a competitive market, in which no single producer has the power to affect the market price, in an oligopolistic market each of the major sellers can affect the market price by changing its output. By contrast to a monopolized market, \"no one firm can unilaterally determine market price by varying its output\" because rivals are large enough to affect the market price by doing the same. <i>Id.</i> at 10. As a result, \"the distinctive characteristic of oligopoly is recognized interdependence among the leading firms: the profit-maximizing choice of price and output for one depends on the choices made by others.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>[5]  In <i>Euromodas, Inc. v.

They had merged in 2004.</p>\n<p>[7]  Plaintiffs brought their suit as a class action, and defendants removed it to federal court pursuant to the Class Action Fairness Act's minimal diversity requirements. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. §§ 1332(d), 1453.</p>\n<p>[8]  Plaintiffs argue that the district court's use, at one point in the opinion, of the word \"exclude\" without the modifying phrase \"tends to\" shows that the court required them to produce direct evidence of conspiracy, rather than only circumstantial evidence tending to exclude the possibility of independent action. It is clear from the court's opinion that it did not require any particular category of evidence.</p>\n<p>[9]  The witnesses observed that Ahern seemed offended by the idea that such a discount would be a necessary condition to secure a permit. He did not feel it was right.</p>\n<p>[10]  A \"market emergency\" is defined as \"[a]ny abnormal disruption of any market for petroleum products, including but not limited to any actual or threatened shortage in the supply... or ... increase in the price,\" resulting from natural disaster, energy failure, war, national or local emergency, or other extraordinary circumstances. 940 Mass.Code Regs. 3.01.</p>\n<p>[11]  Whether this is the proper duration of any market emergency that occurred is not before us. We only note that the rapid decline in defendants' costs beginning in mid-September may indicate that any market emergency was no longer in place. <i>See</i> 940 Mass.Code Regs. 3.01 (defining \"market emergency\").</p>\n<p>[12]  On appeal, plaintiffs ask the court to certify the question of the interpretation of the price-gouging regulation to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. <i>See</i> Mass. S.J.C. R. 1:03 § 1; <i>see also </i><i>The Real Estate Bar Assoc. for Mass., Inc. v. Nat'l Real Estate Info.

Plaintiffs conceded at oral argument that they did not ask the district court to certify the question. In any event, particularly because plaintiffs' case fails even under the interpretation they put forth, we exercise our discretion to decide the question ourselves, declining to certify it. <i>See </i><i>Boston Gas Co. v.

Here, we note that the FTC's petroleum pricing investigation was conducted under a specific mandate from Congress outside the FTCA that included the definition of price-gouging that the FTC was to use, <i>see</i> Federal Trade Commission, <i>Investigation of Gasoline Price Manipulation and Post-Katrina Gasoline Price Increases</i> iii (2006). Moreover, the Massachusetts Attorney General has promulgated a specific rule defining price-gouging for purposes of Chapter 93A.</p>\n<p>[14]  Tisbury's high price, held from September 7 to at least September 18, was $3.57, 37 cents more than its August 22-28 average price of $3.20.</p>\n<p>[15]  XtraMart Citgo's high price, held from September 2-18, was $3.70, 60 cents more than its constant August 22-28 price of $3.10.</p>\n<p>[16]  Edgartown Mobil's high price, held from September 3 to at least September 5, was $3.89, 60 cents more than its constant August 22-28 price of $3.29.</p>\n<p>[17]  Depot Corner's high price, held from September 3-8, was $3.85, 60 cents more than its constant August 22-28 price of $3.25.</p>\n<p>[18]  To calculate average weekly prices, costs, and margins, the data used was from plaintiffs' Exhibit 11, which provided daily price and cost data for all four defendants from July 15 through November 7, 2005. Where price or cost data for a given day was missing, we imputed the value from the most recent recorded value. The parties' citations for prices and gross margins vary among daily, weekly, monthly, and entire-period averages. We have used weekly, rather than daily or monthly averages, in order to capture the major trends in defendants' price and margin changes that other measures would obscure.</p>\n<p>[19]  Some apparent volatility may also be attributable to the missing data referred to in the previous footnote.</p>\n<p>[20]  These <i>monthly</i> average increases from August to September are less than the <i>maximum</i> increases reported for each defendant above. The monthly average increases were 42 cents for Tisbury Shell, 54 cents for XtraMart Citgo, and 53 cents for Edgartown Mobil and Depot Corner.</p>\n\n</div>",
