The   former    Immigration        and\n\nNaturalization      Service    (now   the     Department        of   Homeland\n\nSecurity)    charged     Petitioner     Kimny    Keo,       a    citizen    of\n\nCambodia, with overstaying his non-immigrant visa.                     See 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B).         Petitioner admitted the charge’s\n\nfactual allegations (contained in a Notice to Appear) and\n\nfiled an application for asylum and withholding of removal.\n\nSee 8 U.S.C. §§ 1158(b), 1231(b)(3). 1            In his application,\n\nPetitioner alleged a fear of persecution in Cambodia related\n\nto his past political activities.\n\n      Following a hearing at which Petitioner testified at\n\nlength, the Immigration Judge (IJ) found him not credible.\n\nSee id. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(ii),(iii) (establishing framework\n\nfor credibility determinations).            Based on blanket findings,\n\nthe   IJ   first   concluded    Petitioner      was   not       eligible   for\n\nasylum.     The IJ explained that Petitioner did not meet his\n\nburden of establishing he was a “refugee” within the meaning\n\nof 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42), i.e., one having a well-founded\n\n\n\n      1\n      Petitioner also unsuccessfully sought relief under the\nUnited Nations Convention Against Torture (CAT).     Because\nPetitioner has not argued his CAT claim in his appellate\nbrief, that claim is not before us on the Petition for\nReview. See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st\nCir. 1990) (recognizing “settled appellate rule that issues\nadverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some\neffort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived”).\n\n                                  -2-\n\ffear of persecution based on, among other things, “political\n\nopinion.”      See id. § 1158(b) (requiring applicant for asylum\n\nto   establish     refugee       status).          The    IJ   further    concluded\n\nPetitioner      was    not       entitled     to    withholding         of   removal\n\nbecause he did not meet his burden of establishing his life\n\nor   freedom    would       be   threatened        on    account   of    “political\n\nopinion” if removed to Cambodia.                   See id. § 1231(b)(3).          The\n\nBoard of Immigration Appeals (BIA) dismissed Petitioner’s\n\nappeal, agreeing with the IJ’s “decision for the reasons\n\nstated therein.”            The BIA explained that the IJ’s adverse\n\ncredibility determination was not clearly erroneous.                           See 8\n\nC.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i).\n\n       In Jiang v. Gonzales, 474 F.3d 25, 27 (1st Cir. 2007)\n\nwe   set   forth      the    standard    of    review          applicable    to   the\n\npresent Petition:\n\n       This court reviews findings of fact in immigration\n       proceedings, including findings with respect to\n       credibility, to determine whether those findings\n       are supported by substantial evidence in the\n       record. Under that standard, an adverse credibility\n       determination may stand if it is supported by\n       reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on\n       the record considered as a whole.\n\n(internal quotations and citation omitted).                          We need not\n\nrepeat Petitioner’s story here.                We have carefully reviewed\n\nthe entire record and the parties’ briefs, and conclude the\n\nIJ and BIA reached a permissible result under the applicable\n\nlaw.    We have repeatedly opined that “‘when a lower court\n\n                                        -3-\n\faccurately takes the measure of a case and articulates a\n\ncogent     rationale,     it     serves     no     useful      purpose   for    a\n\nreviewing court to write at length.’”                        Metropolitan Life\n\nIns. Co. v. Zaldivar, 413 F.3d 119, 120 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(quoting Seaco Ins. Co. v. Davis-Irish, 300 F.3d 84, 86 (1st\n\nCir. 2002) (citing cases)).               Because substantial evidence\n\nsupports both the IJ’s and BIA’s respective decisions, we\n\ndeny the Petition for Review for substantially the reasons\n\nset forth in those decisions.
