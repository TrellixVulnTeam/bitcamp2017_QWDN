WALL, ET AL.,\n\n                       Defendants, Appellees.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                  FOR THE DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND\n\n              [Hon. Mary M. Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\n\n      [Hon. Jacob Hagopian, Recalled U.S. Magistrate Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                      Lipez, Selya and Howard,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Norman Laurence on brief pro se.\n\n\n\n\n                         December 24, 2008\n\f            Per     Curiam.   Pro     se     appellant   Norman    Laurence,\n\nincarcerated in the Adult Correctional Institution of the Rhode\n\nIsland Department of Corrections, appeals from a sua sponte order\n\nof the district court dismissing his civil rights complaint,\n\nwithout prejudice, for failure to effect timely service of process.\n\nFor the reasons explained below, we vacate the district court's\n\norder and remand this matter.\n\n            On March 5, 2007, Laurence filed his suit in the United\n\nStates District Court for the District of Rhode Island, along with\n\nhis motion to proceed in forma pauperis (\"IFP\").            Appellant's IFP\n\nmotion was granted, but the magistrate judge recommended that\n\nappellant's complaint be dismissed for failure to contain a short\n\nand plain statement of the claim entitling him to relief under Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).     Laurence moved to amend his complaint and, in\n\ndue course, on September 4, 2007, his second amended complaint was\n\ndocketed.\n\n            The district court entered an order directing the clerk\n\nto send Laurence \"the appropriate materials/forms/letters so that\n\nhe may effect service\" on each named defendant and informing\n\nLaurence that he must serve each of the defendants within 120 days\n\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m).               By letter, the clerk instructed\n\nLaurence to serve the summons, complaint, two copies of the waiver\n\nform, and a self-addressed return envelope, on each of the more\n\nthan   50   named   defendants,     all    prison   employees,   through   the\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fprison's interdepartmental mail system.       Neither the district\n\ncourt's order nor the clerk's letter mentioned 28 U.S.C. ยง 1915(d)\n\nor Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(c)(3).\n\n          Section 1915(d) provides that \"[t]he officers of the\n\ncourt shall issue and serve all process and perform all duties\" for\n\nplaintiffs granted IFP status.    Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(c)(3) provides\n\nthat the district court \"must\" order service by the U.S. Marshal if\n\nthe plaintiff is authorized to proceed IFP under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1915.\n\nApparently unaware of section 1915(d) or Rule 4(c)(3), pursuant to\n\nthe court's order and the clerk's instructions, Laurence undertook\n\nto assemble the summonses, copies of his complaint and waivers, as\n\nwell as a return envelope, for service on over 50 defendants by\n\ninterdepartmental mail. For reasons that are not wholly clear from\n\nthe record, Laurence failed to effect service on any defendant\n\nwithin the 120 days specified by Rule 4(m).\n\n          On February 26, 2008, after reviewing Laurence's \"offer\n\nof proof\" explaining the difficulties he faced attempting to serve\n\nthe defendants, the magistrate judge recommended that Laurence's\n\ncomplaint be dismissed for insufficiency of process. In his timely\n\nobjection to the magistrate judge's report and recommendation,\n\nLaurence requested \"that I be allowed to have all defendants served\n\nby the U.S. Marshals office\" and he requested additional time in\n\nwhich to serve his complaint.     On March 11, 2008, the district\n\ncourt dismissed Laurence's amended complaint, without prejudice,\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fbecause Laurence \"failed to serve properly a single defendant in\n\nthis case.\"     The district court did not address Laurence's request\n\nfor additional time or for service by the United States Marshal.\n\nWe review for abuse of discretion.            Lindsey v. U.S. Railroad\n\nRetirement Bd., 101 F.3d 444, 445 (5th Cir. 1996).\n\n           Under Rule 4(m) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,\n\nwhen a plaintiff shows \"good cause\" for failing to effect service\n\nwithin 120 days after the complaint is filed, \"the court must\n\nextend the time for service for an appropriate period.\"             Each of\n\nthe appeals courts that have addressed the question have found that\n\na   plaintiff   proceeding   IFP   shows   good   cause   when   either   the\n\ndistrict court or the United States Marshals Service fails to\n\nfulfill its obligations under section 1915(d) and Rule 4(c)(3).\n\nE.g., Olsen v. Mapes, 333 F.3d 1199, 1204 (10th Cir. 2003);\n\nLindsey, 101 F.3d at 447; Byrd v. Stone, 94 F.3d 217, 219-20 (6th\n\nCir. 1996); Welch v. Folsom, 925 F.2d 666, 670 (3d Cir. 1991)\n\n(Alito, J.); Puett v. Blandford, 912 F.2d 270, 275 (9th Cir. 1990).\n\nWe join our sister circuits in so holding.\n\n           To the extent that some of our sister circuits suggest\n\nthat the IFP plaintiff must request service of process by the\n\nUnited States Marshal or take other affirmative action to ensure\n\nthat service is effectuated, e.g., Romandette v. Weetabix Co.,\n\nInc., 807 F.2d 309, 311 (2d Cir. 1986), we believe that under the\n\nplain language of section 1915(d) and Rule 4(c)(3), it is not\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fnecessary for the IFP plaintiff to request service of process by\n\nthe   United   States   Marshal.1    The   IFP   plaintiff   is,   however,\n\nrequired to cooperate with the court and the United States Marshal\n\nin effectuating service, including providing the addresses of the\n\nnamed defendants, if needed, and completing any necessary paperwork\n\nand forms.\n\n           On the record before us, we find that the district court\n\nabused its discretion in dismissing Laurence's amended complaint\n\nfor insufficiency of process.        The district court's judgment is\n\nvacated, and the matter is remanded for proceedings consistent with\n\nthis opinion.\n\n           So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n        The practice in the district courts of Massachusetts, New\nHampshire, and Puerto Rico appears not to require the IFP plaintiff\nto make such a request. We note that unlike these district courts,\nthe website for the district court of Rhode Island contains no\ninstructions or guides for the pro se plaintiff and the court's\nLocal Rules do not explain Rule 4(c)(3). To the extent that the\ndistrict court of Maine requires the IFP plaintiff to file a motion\nto request service by the U.S. Marshal, that practice is no longer\npermitted under today's ruling.\n\n                                    -5-\n\f",
