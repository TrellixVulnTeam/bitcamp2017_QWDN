The plaintiffs, twenty-four named\n\nemployees of the Puerto Rico Department of the Treasury (PRDT) and\n\nan organization claiming to represent them, brought suit in the\n\ndistrict court, alleging that they had been discriminated against\n\nat work because of their political views.            After lengthy discovery\n\nand several extensions of time, the district court entered summary\n\njudgment   for   the     defendants    on    a   motion   that   it   considered\n\nunopposed. The plaintiffs argue on appeal that they were denied an\n\nopportunity to depose a third-party witness wrongfully and that the\n\ndistrict court should have allowed them more time to prepare and\n\nfile an opposition to summary judgment.2            We affirm.\n\n                                       I.\n\n           A member of the New Progressive Party (NPP) occupied the\n\nPuerto Rico governorship from 1993 to 2001.               In 2001, a Popular\n\nDemocratic Party (PDP) member became governor. The plaintiffs, who\n\nare members of or otherwise favor the NPP, filed suit in January\n\n2002. Their claims, though not entirely uniform, consisted largely\n\nof allegations that they had been stripped of job functions,\n\nbonuses, and perquisites after the 2000 election, in favor of\n\nemployees sympathetic to the PDP.\n\n           In their complaint, the plaintiffs promised a class\n\naction   that    would    involve     300    similarly-situated       employees.\n\n\n\n     1\n      The organization does not appeal the judgment against it.\nNor do four of the individual plaintiffs.\n\n                                       -2-\n\fHowever, the plaintiffs never sought class certification and never\n\nproduced the additional 276 aggrieved individuals.      Similarly, the\n\nnamed plaintiffs included an organization called \"Asociación de\n\nEmpleados del Departamento de Hacienda por la Democracia.\"           The\n\nplaintiffs   never   produced    any    evidence   pertaining   to   the\n\norganization, and the district court ultimately remarked that it\n\nwas \"not even positive that [the organization] exists.\"\n\n          Discovery was supervised largely by a magistrate judge.\n\nThe materials produced were massive, supporting a summary judgment\n\nrecord 3500 pages long.3        The defendants arranged for several\n\npolitical officials to be produced for depositions.       Nonetheless,\n\nthe plaintiffs were unable to schedule the deposition of a witness\n\nnamed María del Carmen Betancourt-Vázquez, Assistant Secretary for\n\nthe Human Resources Area at PRDT.\n\n          The defendants had notified the plaintiffs early in the\n\ndiscovery process that Betancourt-Vázquez had refused to be deposed\n\nunless subpoenaed, and the plaintiffs apparently attempted to\n\nsubpoena her for a deposition several times.       The parties dispute\n\nexactly what happened.   According to the plaintiffs, Betancourt-\n\nVázquez avoided attempts to subpoena her, going so far as to hide\n\nfrom a process server.     But the plaintiffs did manage to serve\n\nBetancourt-Vázquez with a subpoena two weeks after the discovery\n\n\n\n     2\n      If the plaintiffs' late filed oppositions to summary judgment\nare included in the count, the record swells past 6500 pages.\n\n                                  -3-\n\fperiod had concluded, shortly before the defendants' motion for\n\nsummary judgment was to be filed. The magistrate judge granted the\n\ndefendants' motion to quash that subpoena as untimely.\n\n              The defendants moved for summary judgment on May 12,\n\n2003.       The roughly 3000 pages of evidence that the defendants\n\narrayed      in   support   of   their    motion      included   an   eleven-page\n\ndeclaration       by   Betancourt-Vázquez.         Her   declaration   consisted\n\nmostly of a summary of the personnel records of the plaintiffs,\n\nwhich tended to show that none of them had suffered termination or\n\nreduction in status since the election.\n\n              The plaintiffs argued that without deposing Betancourt-\n\nVázquez they could not adequately oppose the motion for summary\n\njudgment.         They have maintained this position adamantly.              The\n\nplaintiffs moved pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f) to arrange a\n\ndeposition of Betancourt-Vázquez.               The defendants objected.      The\n\ndistrict      court     suggested   that        the   parties    \"amicably   and\n\nprofessionally resolve\" their dispute \"and promptly schedule the\n\ndeposition of\" Betancourt-Vázquez.              Nonetheless, the disagreement\n\nbetween the parties persisted, and the district court referred the\n\nmatter to the magistrate judge.                The magistrate judge concluded\n\nthat no further discovery was warranted.4\n\n\n\n\n        3\n      We reject the plaintiffs' assertion that the magistrate judge\nsomehow lacked authority to resolve the matter as he did.\n\n                                         -4-\n\f          Now angry about their continuing inability to depose\n\nBetancourt-Vázquez, the plaintiffs asked the district court to\n\nreverse the magistrate judge's decision and to allow an additional\n\n120 days to oppose summary judgment.    The district court refused\n\nboth requests. Nearly a full month later, the plaintiffs attempted\n\nto appeal the district court's order.     We denied permission to\n\nbring the appeal.\n\n          Perhaps distracted by the Betancourt-Vázquez discovery\n\ndispute, the plaintiffs failed to file a timely opposition to the\n\ndefendants' summary judgment motion despite a series of extensions\n\nrunning roughly four months beyond the deadline provided by the\n\nlocal rules.   Time actually ran out on the plaintiffs twice.\n\nActing on the plaintiffs' request, the district court had allowed\n\nthe plaintiffs nearly 60 days to oppose summary judgment.     (The\n\nlocal rules provided a fifteen-day deadline.) The magistrate judge\n\nrefused the plaintiffs' request to extend the deadline further.\n\nBut in July, after the 60-day deadline passed without word from the\n\nplaintiffs, the defendants, in an apparent effort to establish a\n\nfirm final deadline for the plaintiffs' response, essentially\n\nrequested a second extension on the plaintiffs' behalf.5       The\n\ndistrict court then granted the plaintiffs an additional 45 days,\n\nuntil the end of August, to oppose summary judgment.\n\n\n     4\n      The district court later noted this oddity in rejecting the\nplaintiffs' contention in their motion for reconsideration that\nthey had filed timely requests for extensions of time.\n\n                               -5-\n\f          When the August deadline neared, the plaintiffs requested\n\nan additional 40 days from the magistrate judge,6 who granted the\n\nrequest, but limited the extension to twenty days and warned that\n\nno further extensions would be allowed.           After the twenty days\n\nexpired, the plaintiffs notified the court that they would need\n\nstill more time \"to begin filing\" their opposition. The plaintiffs\n\nultimately submitted what the district court termed a \"piecemeal\n\nopposition\"   to   summary    judgment;    it   arrived   in    installments\n\ncommencing two weeks after the final deadline for submission and\n\ncontinuing for two and a half months thereafter.\n\n          Citing    the      plaintiffs'   untimeliness        and   \"blatant\n\ndisregard to the Court's case management orders,\"7 the district\n\ncourt decided to consider the defendants' opposition to summary\n\njudgment as unopposed. Still, as required by Rule 56, the district\n\ncourt reviewed each of the plaintiffs' claims, assessing separately\n\nhow the evidence already in the summary judgment record related to\n\neach individual plaintiff.        See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e) (\"If the\n\n\n\n     5\n      Accompanying the motion was the plaintiffs' representation\nthat they had been told by one of the defendants' lawyers that \"he\nwas resigning the case because the defendants wanted to hide\ninformation.\" The plaintiffs repeated the same allegation at oral\nargument before us. However, as the record reveals, the lawyer in\nquestion submitted a sworn declaration, in response to the\nplaintiffs' allegations, denying any such statement.\n     6\n      In addition to twice missing the deadline to oppose summary\njudgment, the plaintiffs previously had been asked to show cause\nwhy they should not be sanctioned for failing to appear at a\nscheduled conference with the magistrate judge.\n\n                                    -6-\n\fadverse     party     does    not   so      respond,    summary      judgment,   if\n\nappropriate,    shall        be   entered    against     the   adverse      party.\")\n\n(emphasis added); Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 159-60\n\n(1970).     The court concluded that the plaintiffs had produced\n\nlittle more than \"bare, boilerplate and conclusory allegations\n\nunsupported by any specific facts,\" and that their case fell short\n\non a number of grounds.             The court focused its analysis on a\n\nthreshold point:       because the plaintiffs were maintained in \"their\n\nofficial designated post[s],\" kept the \"same level and salary,\" and\n\nsuffered \"no changes in rank,\" the plaintiffs had failed to produce\n\nevidence that they had \"suffered a 'constitutionally significant\n\nburden' capable of giving rise to relief.\"                     Mouliert Vidal v.\n\nFlores Galarza, Civil No. 02-1101 at 7, 23 (D.P.R. 2004) (quoting\n\nAgosto-de-Feliciano v. Aponte-Roque, 889 F.2d 1209, 1216-18 (1st\n\nCir. 1989)).    The plaintiffs' efforts to seek relief from judgment\n\nwere unsuccessful, and this appeal followed.\n\n                                         II.\n\n            The plaintiffs appear to raise four issues on appeal:\n\nwhether the district court could permissibly deny their Rule 56(f)\n\nmotion to depose Betancourt-Vázquez; whether the district court\n\ncould     disregard    their      late-arriving        oppositions     to    summary\n\njudgment; whether the district court should have granted relief\n\npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(3) on account of the defendants'\n\nunwillingness or inability to produce Betancourt-Vázquez for a\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fdeposition; and, assuming that the summary judgment motion should\n\nnot have been considered unopposed and that the district court\n\nshould have considered the late submissions in opposition to\n\nsummary    judgment,    whether    the    defendants'       motion   for   summary\n\njudgment was granted properly.                Because we disagree with the\n\nplaintiffs on the first, second, and third issues, we need not\n\ndecide the fourth.\n\nA.   The Rule 56(f) Motion\n\n            Our review of a denial of a Rule 56(f) motion recognizes\n\nthe \"broad . . . considerable discretion\" of the district court\n\nover such matters.       Ayala-Gerena v. Bristol Myers-Squibb Co., 95\n\nF.3d 86, 91 (1st Cir. 1996).             We reverse denials of Rule 56(f)\n\nmotions \"only upon a clear showing of manifest injustice, that is,\n\nwhere the lower court's discovery order was plainly wrong and\n\nresulted    in     substantial    prejudice      to   the    aggrieved     party.\"\n\nFiliatrault v. Comverse Tech. Inc., 275 F.3d 131, 137-38 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).    The plaintiffs have made no such showing.\n\n            Rule     56(f)   allows,     in    certain      circumstances,     for\n\nsupplemental discovery after a motion for summary judgment has been\n\nfiled.     But, while \"district courts should construe Rule 56(f)\n\nmotions generously,\" discovery pursuant to Rule 56(f) is not\n\ngranted as a matter of course.         Ayala-Gerena, 95 F.3d at 92.          As we\n\nhave explained:\n\n            To benefit from the protections of Rule 56(f),\n            a litigant ordinarily must furnish the nisi\n\n                                 -8-\n\f          prius court with a timely statement -- if not\n          by affidavit, then in some other authoritative\n          manner -- that (i) explains his or her current\n          inability to adduce the facts essential to\n          filing   an  opposition,    (ii)  provides   a\n          plausible basis for believing that the sought-\n          after facts can be assembled within a\n          reasonable time, and (iii) indicates how those\n          facts would influence the outcome of the\n          pending summary judgment motion.\n\nVelez v. Awning Windows, Inc., 375 F.3d 35, 40 (1st Cir 2004).   In\n\naddition, the party must \"set forth good cause to explain the\n\nmovant's failure to have conducted the desired discovery at an\n\nearlier date.\"   Massachusetts School of Law at Andover, Inc. v.\n\nAmerican Bar Ass'n, 142 F.3d 26, 44 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n          Even upon submission of the required materials, the\n\ndistrict court is entitled to refuse a Rule 56(f) motion if it\n\nconcludes that the party opposing summary judgment is unlikely to\n\ngarner useful evidence from supplemental discovery, especially when\n\nthe discovery requested would further delay a long-pending case.\n\nSee FDIC v. Kooyomjian, 220 F.3d 10, 15 (1st Cir. 2000); Greebel v.\n\nFTP Software, Inc., 194 F.3d 185, 202 n.15 (1st Cir. 1999); see\n\nalso Fennell v. First Step Designs, Ltd., 83 F.3d 526, 532 (1st\n\nCir. 1996) (holding that district court could balance potential\n\nbenefits of Rule 56(f) discovery against the \"costs, burdens, and\n\ndelays that the proposed discovery entailed\").      Similarly, the\n\ndistrict court may refuse to authorize Rule 56(f) discovery if the\n\ninformation sought will not be pertinent to the theory of law\n\n\n\n                               -9-\n\fadvanced by the summary judgment motion.      Massachusetts School of\n\nLaw at Andover, Inc., 142 F.3d at 44-45.\n\n           While the plaintiffs' several motions on the subject\n\ninsist otherwise, the plaintiffs have not demonstrated why they\n\nneeded to delay the proceedings in order to depose Betancourt-\n\nVázquez. Betancourt-Vázquez's declaration comprises a tiny portion\n\nof the summary judgment record and says almost nothing that the\n\nplaintiffs could not have controverted without further discovery.\n\nMostly, Betancourt-Vázquez summarized the plaintiffs' personnel\n\nfiles.   The plaintiffs already had access to these files.            In\n\nshort, the plaintiffs failed to show that anything discovered by\n\nvirtue   of   a   deposition   of   Betancourt-Vázquez   \"would   [have]\n\ninfluence[d] the outcome of the pending summary judgment motion.\"\n\nVelez, 375 F.3d at 40.         Consequently, we cannot say that the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion in denying the plaintiffs'\n\nrequest for Rule 56(f) relief.\n\nB.   Treating the Summary Judgment Motion as Unopposed\n\n           Our review of the district court's reaction to the\n\nplaintiffs' untimeliness is, again, limited.       We have recognized\n\nthat the district court has wide discretion to manage its caseload\n\nby setting deadlines for filings and holding parties to those\n\ndeadlines.    \"In the absence of a manifest abuse of discretion, . .\n\n. we will not interfere with a district court's reasoned refusal to\n\ngrant incremental enlargements of time.\"      Mendez v. Banco Popular\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fde P.R., 900 F.2d 4, 7 (1st Cir 1990).         When a party fails to meet\n\na reasonable deadline for opposing a motion for summary judgment,\n\nthe   district   court   may   treat   the   summary   judgment   motion   as\n\nunopposed, and deem admitted all facts presented as uncontested by\n\nthe movant.      \"This court has held repeatedly that the district\n\ncourt in Puerto Rico is justified in holding one party's submitted\n\nuncontested facts to be admitted when the other party fails to file\n\noppositions in compliance with the local rules.\"          Torres-Rosado v.\n\nRotger-Sabat, 335 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n           The plaintiffs received extensions running nearly four\n\nmonths.   They failed twice, as the district court pointed out, to\n\nfile for an extension of time before the deadline to oppose summary\n\njudgment passed. Further, the plaintiffs' opposition dribbled into\n\ncourt over the course of two and a half months, not arriving in\n\ncomplete form until a full three months after the court's final\n\ndeadline -- seven months after the defendants' motion for summary\n\njudgment was filed.       This record supports the district court's\n\nconclusion that the plaintiffs' disregard for the court's deadlines\n\nwas \"blatant\" and inexcusable. See Cordero-Soto v. Island Finance,\n\nInc., 418 F.3d 114, 118 (1st Cir. 2005) (holding no abuse of\n\ndiscretion in district court's denial of request for extension of\n\ntime and treatment of summary judgment motion as unopposed, after\n\nparty's repeated failure to comply with deadlines).\n\n\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\f            We are not swayed by the plaintiffs' suggestion that they\n\nshould have been allowed extra time to oppose summary judgment\n\nbecause they were occupied by the Rule 56(f) matter.               Once their\n\nmotion to depose Betancourt-Vázquez was denied, the plaintiffs\n\nshould have gotten back to the task at hand.         Instead, they wasted\n\ntime on an ill-conceived attempt to file an interlocutory appeal.\n\nAs   we   quickly   informed   the   plaintiffs,   they   should    not   have\n\nexpected to secure an interlocutory appeal of the district court's\n\ndiscretionary ruling on a discovery matter.           See, e.g.,       United\n\nStates v. Kouri-Perez, 187 F.3d 1, 13 (1st Cir. 1999) (explaining\n\nreluctance of court of appeals to entertain interlocutory appeals\n\nfrom discretionary rulings of district court that can be challenged\n\non direct appeal).     The district court was not required to save the\n\nplaintiffs from the consequences of their futile efforts.\n\nC.   Rule 60(b)(3)\n\n             The plaintiffs also appear to seek appellate review of\n\nthe denial of relief pursuant to Rule 60(b)(3), which allows \"[o]n\n\nmotion\" for the district court to \"relieve a party . . . from a\n\nfinal judgment\" on account of \"fraud . . . , misrepresentation, or\n\nother misconduct of an adverse party.\"         The plaintiffs' contention\n\nis that such relief should have been granted because of the\n\ndefendants'    unwillingness    to   produce   Betancourt-Vázquez      for   a\n\ndeposition, which they allege constituted misconduct by an adverse\n\nparty.    We certainly do not condone any effort by the defendants to\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fsomehow hide Betancourt-Vázquez, if any such conduct actually\n\noccurred.    But we reject the plaintiffs' request for appellate\n\nreview of any Rule 60(b)(3) claim because they do not suggest how\n\nthey have preserved an appeal on Rule 60(b)(3) grounds.\n\n            The plaintiffs noticed an appeal both of the final\n\njudgment and of the denial of their \"motion for reconsideration.\"\n\nNeither appeal encompasses Rule 60(b)(3) relief.   The plaintiffs'\n\n\"motion for reconsideration\" never argued in any understandable\n\nfashion for Rule 60(b)(3) relief. Rather, the plaintiffs asked the\n\ndistrict court to relieve them from the judgment on account of\n\n\"excusable neglect,\" pursuant to Rule 60(b)(1).    Having failed to\n\ninclude any direct request for Rule 60(b)(3) relief in their motion\n\nfor reconsideration, the plaintiffs have waived any right to ask\n\nfor such relief on appeal from the denial of that motion.       See\n\nLarch v. Mansfield Mun. Elec. Dep't, 272 F.3d 63, 76 (1st Cir.\n\n2001) (holding that failure to raise issue at district court\n\nforecloses party from raising same issue on appeal).      See also\n\nToscano v. Chandris, S.A., 934 F.2d 383, 386-87 (1st Cir. 1991);\n\nCom. of Puerto Rico v. S.S. Zoe Colocotroni, 601 F.2d 39, 42 (1st\n\nCir. 1979) (discussing procedure for seeking Rule 60(b) relief\n\nwhile a case is on appeal).\n\n            Nor does the plaintiffs' appeal from the final judgment\n\nitself allow us to entertain their request for Rule 60(b)(3)\n\nrelief.   Our review of the record reveals that the plaintiffs did\n\n\n                               -13-\n\fmake cursory reference to Rule 60(b)(3) in their motion, several\n\nmonths before the entry of final judgment, to stay the proceedings\n\nwhile they attempted an interlocutory appeal -- essentially a\n\nmotion for more time to oppose summary judgment. But Rule 60(b)(3)\n\nrelief was not available to the plaintiffs until entry of final\n\njudgment.    Farr Man & Co. v. M/V Rozita, 903 F.2d 871, 874 (1st\n\nCir. 1990) (\"It is, by this time, well settled that Rule 60 applies\n\nonly to final judgments.\").\n\nD. Resolution of the Unopposed Summary Judgment Motion\n\n            The plaintiffs suggest that the district court dismissed\n\ntheir case with prejudice as a sanction for their failure to timely\n\noppose summary judgment.     The district court did no such thing.\n\nRather, the district court entered a twenty-four page opinion and\n\norder that discussed each of the plaintiffs' claims under the\n\nappropriate summary judgment standard, limiting the record to the\n\nevidence on file at the time that the period to oppose summary\n\njudgment expired.     This is exactly what the district court was\n\nsupposed to do.    Cordero-Soto, 418 F.3d at 118.\n\n            The plaintiffs have provided no basis for granting them\n\nrelief once we have affirmed the district court's decision to\n\ndisregard their late-filed oppositions to summary judgment.    They\n\nmake no argument that, on the record considered by the district\n\ncourt, the defendants' motion for summary judgment should have been\n\ndenied. Notably, they do not contend in their appellate brief that\n\n\n                                -14-\n\fthe district court was incorrect in concluding, on the available\n\nsummary judgment record, that none of the plaintiffs had suffered\n\na constitutionally cognizable injury.       Consequently, any such\n\nargument is waived.   See Michelson v. Digital Financial Services,\n\n167 F.3d 715, 721 n.2 (1999).   Therefore, we must conclude that the\n\ndistrict court properly entered judgment for the defendants.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -15-\n\f",

The plaintiffs, twenty-four named\n\nemployees of the Puerto Rico Department of the Treasury (PRDT) and\n\nan organization claiming to represent them, brought suit in the\n\ndistrict court, alleging that they had been discriminated against\n\nat work because of their political views.            After lengthy discovery\n\nand several extensions of time, the district court entered summary\n\njudgment   for   the     defendants    on    a   motion   that   it   considered\n\nunopposed. The plaintiffs argue on appeal that they were denied an\n\nopportunity to depose a third-party witness wrongfully and that the\n\ndistrict court should have allowed them more time to prepare and\n\nfile an opposition to summary judgment.2            We affirm.\n\n                                       I.\n\n           A member of the New Progressive Party (NPP) occupied the\n\nPuerto Rico governorship from 1993 to 2001.               In 2001, a Popular\n\nDemocratic Party (PDP) member became governor. The plaintiffs, who\n\nare members of or otherwise favor the NPP, filed suit in January\n\n2002. Their claims, though not entirely uniform, consisted largely\n\nof allegations that they had been stripped of job functions,\n\nbonuses, and perquisites after the 2000 election, in favor of\n\nemployees sympathetic to the PDP.\n\n           In their complaint, the plaintiffs promised a class\n\naction   that    would    involve     300    similarly-situated       employees.\n\n\n\n     1\n      The organization does not appeal the judgment against it.\nNor do four of the individual plaintiffs.\n\n                                       -2-\n\fHowever, the plaintiffs never sought class certification and never\n\nproduced the additional 276 aggrieved individuals.      Similarly, the\n\nnamed plaintiffs included an organization called \"Asociación de\n\nEmpleados del Departamento de Hacienda por la Democracia.\"           The\n\nplaintiffs   never   produced    any    evidence   pertaining   to   the\n\norganization, and the district court ultimately remarked that it\n\nwas \"not even positive that [the organization] exists.\"\n\n          Discovery was supervised largely by a magistrate judge.\n\nThe materials produced were massive, supporting a summary judgment\n\nrecord 3500 pages long.3        The defendants arranged for several\n\npolitical officials to be produced for depositions.       Nonetheless,\n\nthe plaintiffs were unable to schedule the deposition of a witness\n\nnamed María del Carmen Betancourt-Vázquez, Assistant Secretary for\n\nthe Human Resources Area at PRDT.\n\n          The defendants had notified the plaintiffs early in the\n\ndiscovery process that Betancourt-Vázquez had refused to be deposed\n\nunless subpoenaed, and the plaintiffs apparently attempted to\n\nsubpoena her for a deposition several times.       The parties dispute\n\nexactly what happened.   According to the plaintiffs, Betancourt-\n\nVázquez avoided attempts to subpoena her, going so far as to hide\n\nfrom a process server.     But the plaintiffs did manage to serve\n\nBetancourt-Vázquez with a subpoena two weeks after the discovery\n\n\n\n     2\n      If the plaintiffs' late filed oppositions to summary judgment\nare included in the count, the record swells past 6500 pages.\n\n                                  -3-\n\fperiod had concluded, shortly before the defendants' motion for\n\nsummary judgment was to be filed. The magistrate judge granted the\n\ndefendants' motion to quash that subpoena as untimely.\n\n              The defendants moved for summary judgment on May 12,\n\n2003.       The roughly 3000 pages of evidence that the defendants\n\narrayed      in   support   of   their    motion      included   an   eleven-page\n\ndeclaration       by   Betancourt-Vázquez.         Her   declaration   consisted\n\nmostly of a summary of the personnel records of the plaintiffs,\n\nwhich tended to show that none of them had suffered termination or\n\nreduction in status since the election.\n\n              The plaintiffs argued that without deposing Betancourt-\n\nVázquez they could not adequately oppose the motion for summary\n\njudgment.         They have maintained this position adamantly.              The\n\nplaintiffs moved pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f) to arrange a\n\ndeposition of Betancourt-Vázquez.               The defendants objected.      The\n\ndistrict      court     suggested   that        the   parties    \"amicably   and\n\nprofessionally resolve\" their dispute \"and promptly schedule the\n\ndeposition of\" Betancourt-Vázquez.              Nonetheless, the disagreement\n\nbetween the parties persisted, and the district court referred the\n\nmatter to the magistrate judge.                The magistrate judge concluded\n\nthat no further discovery was warranted.4\n\n\n\n\n        3\n      We reject the plaintiffs' assertion that the magistrate judge\nsomehow lacked authority to resolve the matter as he did.\n\n                                         -4-\n\f          Now angry about their continuing inability to depose\n\nBetancourt-Vázquez, the plaintiffs asked the district court to\n\nreverse the magistrate judge's decision and to allow an additional\n\n120 days to oppose summary judgment.    The district court refused\n\nboth requests. Nearly a full month later, the plaintiffs attempted\n\nto appeal the district court's order.     We denied permission to\n\nbring the appeal.\n\n          Perhaps distracted by the Betancourt-Vázquez discovery\n\ndispute, the plaintiffs failed to file a timely opposition to the\n\ndefendants' summary judgment motion despite a series of extensions\n\nrunning roughly four months beyond the deadline provided by the\n\nlocal rules.   Time actually ran out on the plaintiffs twice.\n\nActing on the plaintiffs' request, the district court had allowed\n\nthe plaintiffs nearly 60 days to oppose summary judgment.     (The\n\nlocal rules provided a fifteen-day deadline.) The magistrate judge\n\nrefused the plaintiffs' request to extend the deadline further.\n\nBut in July, after the 60-day deadline passed without word from the\n\nplaintiffs, the defendants, in an apparent effort to establish a\n\nfirm final deadline for the plaintiffs' response, essentially\n\nrequested a second extension on the plaintiffs' behalf.5       The\n\ndistrict court then granted the plaintiffs an additional 45 days,\n\nuntil the end of August, to oppose summary judgment.\n\n\n     4\n      The district court later noted this oddity in rejecting the\nplaintiffs' contention in their motion for reconsideration that\nthey had filed timely requests for extensions of time.\n\n                               -5-\n\f          When the August deadline neared, the plaintiffs requested\n\nan additional 40 days from the magistrate judge,6 who granted the\n\nrequest, but limited the extension to twenty days and warned that\n\nno further extensions would be allowed.           After the twenty days\n\nexpired, the plaintiffs notified the court that they would need\n\nstill more time \"to begin filing\" their opposition. The plaintiffs\n\nultimately submitted what the district court termed a \"piecemeal\n\nopposition\"   to   summary    judgment;    it   arrived   in    installments\n\ncommencing two weeks after the final deadline for submission and\n\ncontinuing for two and a half months thereafter.\n\n          Citing    the      plaintiffs'   untimeliness        and   \"blatant\n\ndisregard to the Court's case management orders,\"7 the district\n\ncourt decided to consider the defendants' opposition to summary\n\njudgment as unopposed. Still, as required by Rule 56, the district\n\ncourt reviewed each of the plaintiffs' claims, assessing separately\n\nhow the evidence already in the summary judgment record related to\n\neach individual plaintiff.        See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e) (\"If the\n\n\n\n     5\n      Accompanying the motion was the plaintiffs' representation\nthat they had been told by one of the defendants' lawyers that \"he\nwas resigning the case because the defendants wanted to hide\ninformation.\" The plaintiffs repeated the same allegation at oral\nargument before us. However, as the record reveals, the lawyer in\nquestion submitted a sworn declaration, in response to the\nplaintiffs' allegations, denying any such statement.\n     6\n      In addition to twice missing the deadline to oppose summary\njudgment, the plaintiffs previously had been asked to show cause\nwhy they should not be sanctioned for failing to appear at a\nscheduled conference with the magistrate judge.\n\n                                    -6-\n\fadverse     party     does    not   so      respond,    summary      judgment,   if\n\nappropriate,    shall        be   entered    against     the   adverse      party.\")\n\n(emphasis added); Adickes v.

The court concluded that the plaintiffs had produced\n\nlittle more than \"bare, boilerplate and conclusory allegations\n\nunsupported by any specific facts,\" and that their case fell short\n\non a number of grounds.             The court focused its analysis on a\n\nthreshold point:       because the plaintiffs were maintained in \"their\n\nofficial designated post[s],\" kept the \"same level and salary,\" and\n\nsuffered \"no changes in rank,\" the plaintiffs had failed to produce\n\nevidence that they had \"suffered a 'constitutionally significant\n\nburden' capable of giving rise to relief.\"                     Mouliert Vidal v.\n\nFlores Galarza, Civil No. 02-1101 at 7, 23 (D.P.R. 2004) (quoting\n\nAgosto-de-Feliciano v.

Betancourt-Vázquez's declaration comprises a tiny portion\n\nof the summary judgment record and says almost nothing that the\n\nplaintiffs could not have controverted without further discovery.\n\nMostly, Betancourt-Vázquez summarized the plaintiffs' personnel\n\nfiles.   The plaintiffs already had access to these files.            In\n\nshort, the plaintiffs failed to show that anything discovered by\n\nvirtue   of   a   deposition   of   Betancourt-Vázquez   \"would   [have]\n\ninfluence[d] the outcome of the pending summary judgment motion.\"\n\nVelez, 375 F.3d at 40.

Further, the plaintiffs' opposition dribbled into\n\ncourt over the course of two and a half months, not arriving in\n\ncomplete form until a full three months after the court's final\n\ndeadline -- seven months after the defendants' motion for summary\n\njudgment was filed.       This record supports the district court's\n\nconclusion that the plaintiffs' disregard for the court's deadlines\n\nwas \"blatant\" and inexcusable. See Cordero-Soto v.

Once their\n\nmotion to depose Betancourt-Vázquez was denied, the plaintiffs\n\nshould have gotten back to the task at hand.         Instead, they wasted\n\ntime on an ill-conceived attempt to file an interlocutory appeal.\n\nAs   we   quickly   informed   the   plaintiffs,   they   should    not   have\n\nexpected to secure an interlocutory appeal of the district court's\n\ndiscretionary ruling on a discovery matter.

The district court was not required to save the\n\nplaintiffs from the consequences of their futile efforts.\n\nC.   Rule 60(b)(3)\n\n             The plaintiffs also appear to seek appellate review of\n\nthe denial of relief pursuant to Rule 60(b)(3), which allows \"[o]n\n\nmotion\" for the district court to \"relieve a party . . . from a\n\nfinal judgment\" on account of \"fraud . . . , misrepresentation, or\n\nother misconduct of an adverse party.\"         The plaintiffs' contention\n\nis that such relief should have been granted because of the\n\ndefendants'    unwillingness    to   produce   Betancourt-Vázquez      for   a\n\ndeposition, which they allege constituted misconduct by an adverse\n\nparty.    We certainly do not condone any effort by the defendants to\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fsomehow hide Betancourt-Vázquez, if any such conduct actually\n\noccurred.    But we reject the plaintiffs' request for appellate\n\nreview of any Rule 60(b)(3) claim because they do not suggest how\n\nthey have preserved an appeal on Rule 60(b)(3) grounds.\n\n            The plaintiffs noticed an appeal both of the final\n\njudgment and of the denial of their \"motion for reconsideration.\"\n\nNeither appeal encompasses Rule 60(b)(3) relief.   The plaintiffs'\n\n\"motion for reconsideration\" never argued in any understandable\n\nfashion for Rule 60(b)(3) relief. Rather, the plaintiffs asked the\n\ndistrict court to relieve them from the judgment on account of\n\n\"excusable neglect,\" pursuant to Rule 60(b)(1).    Having failed to\n\ninclude any direct request for Rule 60(b)(3) relief in their motion\n\nfor reconsideration, the plaintiffs have waived any right to ask\n\nfor such relief on appeal from the denial of that motion.

Our review of the record reveals that the plaintiffs did\n\n\n                               -13-\n\fmake cursory reference to Rule 60(b)(3) in their motion, several\n\nmonths before the entry of final judgment, to stay the proceedings\n\nwhile they attempted an interlocutory appeal -- essentially a\n\nmotion for more time to oppose summary judgment. But Rule 60(b)(3)\n\nrelief was not available to the plaintiffs until entry of final\n\njudgment.    Farr Man & Co. v.

Resolution of the Unopposed Summary Judgment Motion\n\n            The plaintiffs suggest that the district court dismissed\n\ntheir case with prejudice as a sanction for their failure to timely\n\noppose summary judgment.     The district court did no such thing.\n\nRather, the district court entered a twenty-four page opinion and\n\norder that discussed each of the plaintiffs' claims under the\n\nappropriate summary judgment standard, limiting the record to the\n\nevidence on file at the time that the period to oppose summary\n\njudgment expired.     This is exactly what the district court was\n\nsupposed to do.    Cordero-Soto, 418 F.3d at 118.\n\n            The plaintiffs have provided no basis for granting them\n\nrelief once we have affirmed the district court's decision to\n\ndisregard their late-filed oppositions to summary judgment.    They\n\nmake no argument that, on the record considered by the district\n\ncourt, the defendants' motion for summary judgment should have been\n\ndenied. Notably, they do not contend in their appellate brief that\n\n\n                                -14-\n\fthe district court was incorrect in concluding, on the available\n\nsummary judgment record, that none of the plaintiffs had suffered\n\na constitutionally cognizable injury.       Consequently, any such\n\nargument is waived.   See Michelson v.
