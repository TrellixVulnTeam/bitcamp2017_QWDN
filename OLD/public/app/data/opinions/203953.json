After a thorough review of the record\n\nand of the parties' submissions, we affirm. This court reviews\n\nde novo the district court's rulings regarding the preclusive\n\neffect of a prior judgment under res judicata principles.   See\n\nCoors Brewing Co. v. Mendez-Torres, 562 F.3d 3, 8 (1st Cir.\n\n2009) (citation omitted).   \"A federal court is generally bound\n\nunder res judicata to give the same preclusive effect to a\n\nstate court judgment as would be given to it by a local court\n\nwithin that state. [] This is true regardless whether the\n\nstate-court decision involves federal or state law.\"        FPL\n\nEnergy Maine Hydro LLC v. F.E.R.C., 551 F.3d 58, 63 (1st Cir.\n\n2008).   Under New Hampshire law,\n\n           Res judicata precludes the litigation in a\n           later case of matters actually decided,\n           and   matters   that   could   have   been\n           litigated, in an earlier action between\n           the same parties for the same cause of\n           action. [] For the doctrine to apply,\n           three elements must be met:       (1) the\n           parties must be the same or in privity\n           with one another; (2) the same cause of\n           action must be before the court in both\n           instances; and (3) a final judgment on the\n           merits must have been rendered in the\n           first action.\n\nMeier v. Town of Littleton, 154 N.H. 340, 342, 910 A.2d 1243,\n\n1245 (2006) (citation omitted).\n\n           In this instance, the parties clearly are the same.\n\nIn all three cases, appellant John R. Griffin, Jr. (\"Griffin\")\n\nsued the Town of Whitefield, New Hampshire, Officer Richard\n\n                              -2-\n\fBrown and Officer Shawn White; he also named Justice of the\n\nPeace Judith Ramsdell in the 2007 action and in the federal\n\nsuit. Likewise, the same causes of action have been before the\n\ncourts in all three cases.        Under New Hampshire law, in order\n\nto determine whether the same causes of action were present in\n\nboth cases, the court considers whether the causes of action\n\narise out of the same transaction or occurrence.               See Sleeper\n\nv. Hoban Family Partnership, 157 N.H. 530, 534, 955 A.2d 879,\n\n883 (2008) (citing In re University Syst. of New Hampshire, 147\n\nN.H. 626, 629, 795 A.2d 840, 843 (2002)).                 Here, all three\n\nactions    clearly     arise   out     of   the    same   transaction     or\n\noccurrence, i.e., Griffin's arrest in August 2004 on a charge\n\nthat he violated a protection order.              A final judgment on the\n\nmerits    has   been   rendered   in    the   state    court   as   to   all\n\ndefendants as well.\n\n            Griffin complains that the state trial judge who\n\nheard his first case was prejudiced against him; but Griffin's\n\nremedy for any alleged prejudice was to appeal the trial\n\njudge's decision to the New Hampshire Supreme Court, and\n\nGriffin apparently failed to pursue this remedy in a timely\n\nmanner.     Because Griffin did not effectively pursue this\n\nremedy, the state trial judge's decision is final and must be\n\nrespected by this court under res judicata principles.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f             Appellant's Motion for Status Report is denied as\n\nmoot.   Appellant's Motion to Compel Documentation as Evidence\n\nis denied.    Appellant's Motion for Punitive Damages is denied.\n\n             Affirmed.   See 1st Cir.
