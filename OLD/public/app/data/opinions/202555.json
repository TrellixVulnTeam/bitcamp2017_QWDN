Héctor M. Laffitte, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                     Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                   Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Juan José Nolla-Acosta, with whom Nicolás Nogueras-Cartagena\nwas on brief, for appellant.\n     Luis Sánchez-Betances, with whom Sánchez-Betances, Sifre,\nMuñoz-Noya & Rivera, P.S.C., was on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n                           December 15, 2006\n\f              Per   Curiam.        Plaintiff-Appellant    Angela    Lynn   Zareas\n\n(\"Zareas\") appeals the dismissal of her complaint against Luis\n\nBared San Martin and Ana Maria Bared Espinosa (together, the\n\n\"Bareds\"),     pursuant       to   the   Racketeer    Influenced    and    Corrupt\n\nOrganizations Act (\"RICO\"), 18 U.S.C. § 1961 et seq.                Dismissal of\n\nZareas's civil RICO claim under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) was\n\nrecommended by a magistrate judge, and the dismissal was granted by\n\nthe district court below.             The magistrate judge found that the\n\nclaim was barred by the four-year statute of limitations on civil\n\nRICO claims. See Agency Holding Corp. v. Malley-Duff & Assoc.,\n\nInc.,   483    U.S.   143,     155   (1987).    The    magistrate    judge   also\n\nconcluded that even had the claim not been time barred, Zareas\n\nneither pled with specificity pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b) nor\n\nadequately established a causal nexus between the Bareds' alleged\n\nactivities and the purported injury.                  After evaluating these\n\nfindings, we affirm.\n\n              Although this appeal has not raised difficult questions\n\nof law, we feel compelled to address the inadequacy of Zareas's\n\nalleged injury.       In order to recover under a civil RICO claim, the\n\nplaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant(s) not only conducted\n\nan enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity, but that\n\nthe alleged activity has caused injury to the plaintiff's \"business\n\nor property.\"       Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 496-97\n\n(1985).   Here, Zareas has alleged that the Bareds engaged in the\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\ffraudulent sale of duty-free goods. Her alleged injuries, however,\n\nare emotional distress, and deprivation of property owed her\n\npursuant to her former marriage to the Bareds' son.\n\n           The alleged injuries fail for four reasons.                  Three of\n\nthese reasons were addressed by the magistrate judge.              The fourth\n\nis our own observation.        First, claims for personal injuries, such\n\nas emotional distress, are not \"business or property\" and are not\n\ncognizable under RICO. See Van Schaick v. Church of Scientology of\n\nCalifornia,    Inc.,     535   F.   Supp.   1125,   1137   (D.   Mass.     1982)\n\n(concluding that personal injury cases are not within the ambit of\n\nthe RICO statute); see also Martin v. Fleet Nat. Bank, 676 F. Supp.\n\n423, 432 (D.R.I. 1987)(\"concerning plaintiffs' claims of personal\n\npsychic injuries and emotional distress, this court can only note\n\nthat civil RICO does not provide a remedy for such harms\").\n\nSecond, the ownership of the disputed property was addressed in\n\nZareas's divorce proceedings by the Puerto Rico Court of First\n\nInstance and the Puerto Rico Court of Appeals.             Both courts found\n\nthat Zareas has no ownership interest in the property.             This Court\n\nis bound by these state court decisions pursuant to the full faith\n\nand   credit   clause.    28   U.S.C.   §   1738.     Third,     even    if   the\n\nallegations against the Bareds were true, there is no causal effect\n\nbetween their alleged activity and Zareas's purported injury. See\n\nMiranda v. Ponce Fed. Bank, 948 F.2d 41, 47 (1st Cir. 1991)(there\n\nmust be a causal relationship between the injury asserted and the\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fpredicate acts under the RICO statute).    The fraudulent sale of\n\nduty-free goods could in no way cause injury to Zareas's purported\n\nproperty.     In fact, the only possible connection between the\n\nalleged RICO activity and Zareas's purported injury could be that\n\nthe property was attained by or paid for with profits from the\n\nalleged activity. This leads us to the fourth ground for rejecting\n\nZareas's purported injury: if we are to believe that Zareas's\n\nallegations are sincere, then she is asking the court to recognize\n\nand enforce an interest in property that was ill-gotten or paid for\n\nby ill-gotten monies.   Such claims are not cognizable.   We award\n\nstandard costs to the appellees.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -4-\n\f",
