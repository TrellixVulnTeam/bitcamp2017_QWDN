Hector M. Laffitte, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                         Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n\n                 Baldock,* Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                    and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Rafael A. Oliveras Lopez De Victoria was on brief for\nappellant.\n     Salvador J. Antonetti Stutts, Solicitor General, with whom\nMariana Negrón Vargas, Deputy Solicitor General, was on brief for\nAppellee.\n\n\n\n                             May 18, 2005\n\n\n\n\n     *\n        Of the   Tenth    Circuit    Court   of   Appeals,   sitting   by\ndesignation.\n\f          BALDOCK, Senior Circuit Judge.            Plaintiff Rossi Peña-\n\nCrespo brought this action alleging employment discrimination under\n\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e-\n\n2000e-17, against her employer, the Department of Family Affairs of\n\nthe Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Plaintiff, who is originally from\n\nthe Dominican Republic, alleged she was subjected to a hostile work\n\nenvironment on the basis of her national origin.             After a bench\n\ntrial, the district court concluded Plaintiff was subjected to a\n\nhostile work environment and awarded her $12,000 in damages.\n\nThereafter,   Plaintiff   filed   a   motion   to    alter   or   amend   the\n\njudgment, which the district court denied.             Plaintiff appeals,\n\narguing the district court erred in (1) excluding her psychiatric\n\nexpert from testifying at trial, and (2) limiting her damage award\n\nto $12,000.    We have jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 1291, and after\n\nreviewing the district court’s decision to exclude expert testimony\n\nand its award of damages for an abuse of discretion, see Willhauck\n\nv. Halpin, 953 F.2d 689, 717 (1st Cir. 1991); Lawton v. Nyman, 327\n\nF.3d 30, 37 (1st Cir. 2003), we affirm.1\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       Upon reviewing Plaintiff’s notice of appeal, it is unclear\nas to whether she is appealing the district court’s underlying\njudgment and/or the denial of her motion to alter or amend the\njudgment. Although the two are generally distinct for purposes of\nappeal, see Correa v. Cruisers, A Div. of KCS Int’l, Inc., 298 F.3d\n13, 21 n.3 (1st Cir. 2002), such a distinction is irrelevant in\nthis case because Plaintiff’s issues are the same under both. See\nid. Further, we have jurisdiction to review Plaintiff’s claims\nnotwithstanding the fact she was the prevailing party below.\nSee Depost Guar. Nat’l Bank v. Roper, 445 U.S. 326, 333-34 (1980);\nHerbert v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 911 F.2d 1044 (5th Cir. 1990)\n(per curiam).\n\n                                  -2-\n\f                                    I.\n\n            We need not engage in an exhaustive recitation of the\n\nfacts given the limited issues raised on appeal.            Suffice it to\n\nsay, Plaintiff was born in the Dominican Republic and came to\n\nPuerto Rico in 1969.       Plaintiff has worked at the Department of\n\nFamily Affairs since 1989, and has been promoted several times.\n\nBetween 1999 and 2000, Plaintiff’s co-workers and supervisors,\n\namong other things, directed derogatory and disparaging comments\n\nand jokes towards Plaintiff because of her Dominican background.\n\nPlaintiff reported the offensive remarks to her supervisors, but\n\nthey failed to remedy the situation.         Plaintiff filed a charge of\n\ndiscrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\n\n(“EEOC”).      The agency issued Plaintiff a right-to-sue letter.\n\n            Plaintiff filed suit.        After several delays, extensive\n\ndiscovery, and ruling on numerous motions, the district court set\n\nthe bench-trial for December 1, 2003.             On November 5, 2003,\n\nDefendant filed a motion in limine seeking to exclude the testimony\n\nof Plaintiff’s expert witness and treating psychiatrist, Dr. José\n\nAlberto Alonso.      Defendant argued (1) the identity of Plaintiff’s\n\nexpert witness had not been properly disclosed as required under\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(1), (2) Plaintiff failed to provide a written\n\nexpert report satisfying the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n26(a)(2)(B), and (3) the documents Dr. Alonso submitted were\n\nwritten   in    Spanish,   rather   than   in   English,   and   were   thus\n\ninadmissible under the district court’s local rules.         The district\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fcourt, without analysis, granted Defendant’s motion in limine and\n\nexcluded Dr. Alonso from testifying at trial.\n\n             After trial, the district court issued its findings of\n\nfact and     conclusions     of    law.         The    court   concluded   Defendant\n\nviolated Title VII.          In calculating damages, the court found\n\n“because     Peña   failed    to    present        expert      testimony   from   her\n\npsychiatrist, the Court will limit the amount of damages that she\n\ncan receive for mental and/or emotional suffering.”                        The court\n\nultimately granted Plaintiff damages in the amount of $12,000.\n\nPlaintiff filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment, arguing,\n\namong other things, the district court erred in excluding her\n\nexpert witness from testifying at trial and limiting the amount of\n\nher emotional damages.             The district court denied Plaintiff’s\n\nmotion.\n\n                                          II.\n\n                                          A.\n\n             Plaintiff argues the district court erred in excluding\n\nher   expert    witness,     Dr.    Alonso,           from   testifying    at   trial.\n\nSpecifically, Plaintiff claims she fully disclosed Dr. Alonso’s\n\nname as an expert witness almost six months prior to trial.\n\nFurther, Plaintiff argues she satisfied the written expert report\n\nrequirements under Rule 26(a)(2)(B) when she submitted Dr. Alonso’s\n\npsychiatric evaluation, resume, and Plaintiff’s medical records to\n\nDefendant on “various occasions.”2\n\n\n      2\n          Plaintiff also argues the district court erred in allowing\n                                                      (continued...)\n\n                                          -4-\n\f            Plaintiff   timely   disclosed   Dr.   Alonso   as   an   expert\n\nwitness.3   Plaintiff, however, failed to provide a written expert\n\nreport.     Rule 26 requires the disclosure of a witness “who is\n\nretained or specially employed to provide expert testimony in the\n\ncase . . . be accompanied by a written report prepared and signed\n\nby the witness.”   Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(B).       The written report\n\nmust contain:\n\n     [A] complete statement of all opinions to be expressed\n     and the basis and reasons therefor; the data or other\n     information considered by the witness in forming the\n     opinions; any exhibits to be used as a summary of or\n     support for the opinions; the qualifications of the\n     witness, including a list of all publications authored by\n     the witness within the preceding ten years; the\n     compensation to be paid for the study and testimony; and\n     a listing of any other cases in which the witness has\n     testified as an expert at trial or by deposition within\n     the preceding four years.\n\nId.; see also Prieto v. Malgor, 361 F.3d 1313, 1317-18 (11th Cir.\n\n2004) (noting submitting the expert witness’ name is not enough and\n\nthat each witness must provide a written report containing the\n\ninformation required under Rule 26). A party who fails to disclose\n\nthe necessary information under Rule 26(a), without substantial\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      (...continued)\nfive of Defendant’s witnesses to testify over her objections. We\nsummarily reject this argument because even if the court erred,\nsuch error was harmless. See Deary v. City of Gloucester, 9 F.3d\n191, 197 (1st Cir. 1993).      Each of the five witnesses only\ntestified as to Defendant’s liability under Title VII and the\ndistrict court found for Plaintiff as to liability.          Thus\nPlaintiff’s substantial rights were not affected.\n     3\n       Our review of the record shows Plaintiff listed Dr. Alonso\nas a possible expert witness in, among other things, the pre-trial\norder.\n\n                                   -5-\n\fjustification, is not permitted to present the witness’ testimony\n\nat trial.    Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1).\n\n            We   have    recognized    that    “[i]n      the    arena   of    expert\n\ndiscovery--a        setting   which    often    involves         complex      factual\n\ninquiries--Rule 26 increases the quality of trials by better\n\npreparing attorneys for cross-examination.”                     Laplace-Bayard v.\n\nBatlle, 295 F.3d 157, 162 (1st Cir. 2002) (internal quotation and\n\ncitation omitted).       The failure to provide an expert report that\n\nsatisfies the specific requirements of Rule 26(a)(2)(B) undermines\n\nopposing    counsel’s     ability     to   prepare       for    trial.      See   id.\n\nAccordingly, “district courts have broad discretion in meting out\n\n. . . sanctions for Rule 26 violations . . . [and the] [e]xclusion\n\nof evidence is a standard sanction for a violation of the duty of\n\ndisclosure under Rule 26(a).” Id. (internal quotation and citation\n\nomitted).\n\n            In this case, Plaintiff’s expert witness, Dr. Alonso, did\n\nnot prepare or submit a written report meeting the requirements of\n\nRule 26(a)(2)(B). Although Plaintiff appears to have submitted, at\n\nvarious     times     throughout    discovery,       a    series    of     documents\n\nconsisting of Dr. Alonso’s psychiatric evaluation, his resume, and\n\nPlaintiff’s medical records, such disclosures do not satisfy Rule\n\n26(a).    Specifically, the documents did not: (1) explain the basis\n\nand reasons for Dr. Alonso’s opinions; (2) describe any exhibits\n\nDr. Alonso planned on using; (3) list Dr. Alonso’s publications or\n\nother cases in which he had testified previously; or (4) set forth\n\nDr. Alonso’s expected compensation for his testimony and services.\n\n                                       -6-\n\fAccordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\nexcluding Dr. Alonso from testifying as an expert witness at trial.\n\n          Moreover,      even   assuming    the    documents   satisfied      the\n\nrequirements of Rule 26(a), the district court, in excluding Dr.\n\nAlonso’s testimony, may have also relied on Plaintiff’s failure to\n\nprovide   an   English    translation      of     Dr.   Alonso’s    psychiatric\n\nevaluation and resume as the Local Rules require.                  See U.S.D.C.\n\nP.R. R. 10(b); 48 U.S.C. § 864 (noting “[a]ll pleadings and\n\nproceedings in the United States District Court for the District of\n\nPuerto Rico shall be conducted in the English language.”).                    The\n\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion.              Further, Plaintiff\n\ndid not attempt to remedy her omission before the district court or\n\nto obtain a stipulation from opposing counsel as to an accurate\n\ntranslation.     Thus, there is no occasion to consider whether\n\nPlaintiff’s error could be rendered harmless by later events.\n\nSee United States v. Morales-Madera, 352 F.3d 1, 7-11 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).\n\n\n\n                                     B.\n\n          Plaintiff      next   claims     the    district   court    erred    in\n\nlimiting her damage award to $12,000.             Plaintiff raises the claim\n\nin her “issues before the court” section of her opening brief.\n\nPlaintiff’s only other reference to the matter, however, is her\n\nbroad statement that “[i]f the . . . Court had not excluded the\n\ntestimony [of Dr. Alonso] . . . the award in damages could ha[ve]\n\nbeen in a greater amount than $12,000.”            Plaintiff then speculates\n\n                                    -7-\n\fthat her    “mental condition easily could be evaluated in an amount\n\ngreater than $12,000.”    Plaintiff fails to provide any additional\n\nanalysis regarding her damages issue. We have repeatedly held that\n\n“issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some\n\neffort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.”        In re\n\nGosselin, 276 F.3d 70, 72 (1st Cir. 2002)(internal quotation and\n\ncitation omitted); see also Mulvihill v. Top-Flite Golf Co., 335\n\nF.3d 15, 27 (1st Cir. 2003)(noting an issue is waived when “the\n\nproponent mentions it as a possible argument in the most skeletal\n\nway, leaving the court to do counsel’s work”) (internal quotation\n\nomitted).\n\n            Furthermore, given our prior holding that the district\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in excluding Dr. Alonso’s expert\n\ntestimony, we need not discuss what effect Dr. Alonso’s testimony\n\nmay have had on Plaintiff’s emotional damages award.       To do so\n\nwould constitute mere speculation and guesswork.       The district\n\ncourt properly limited Plaintiff’s damages for mental or emotional\n\nsuffering because Plaintiff failed to present the testimony of a\n\nmental health expert.    Although we have held that expert testimony\n\nis not necessarily required, “the lack of such evidence is relevant\n\nto the amount of the award.”   Koster v. Trans World Airlines, Inc.,\n\n181 F.3d 24, 35 (1st Cir. 1999) (emphasis added).\n\n            Based on the foregoing, the district court’s judgment is\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f",

[and the] [e]xclusion of evidence is a standard sanction for a violation of the duty of disclosure under Rule 26(a).\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, Plaintiff's expert witness, Dr. Alonso, did not prepare or submit a written report meeting the requirements of Rule 26(a)(2)(B). Although Plaintiff appears to have submitted, at various times throughout discovery, a series of documents consisting of Dr. Alonso's psychiatric evaluation, his resume, and Plaintiff's medical records, such disclosures do not satisfy Rule 26(a). Specifically, the documents did not: (1) explain the basis and reasons for Dr. Alonso's opinions; (2) describe any exhibits Dr. Alonso planned on using; (3) list Dr. Alonso's publications or other cases in which he had testified previously; or (4) set forth Dr. Alonso's expected compensation for his testimony and services. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding Dr. Alonso from testifying as an expert witness at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, even assuming the documents satisfied the requirements of Rule 26(a), the district court, in excluding Dr. Alonso's testimony, may have also relied on Plaintiff's failure to provide an English translation of Dr. Alonso's psychiatric evaluation and resume as the Local Rules require. <i>See</i> U.S.D.C. P.R. R. 10(b); 48 U.S.C. &#167; 864 (noting \"[a]ll pleadings and proceedings in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico shall be conducted in the English language.\"). The district court did not abuse its discretion. Further, Plaintiff did not attempt to remedy her omission before the district court or to obtain a stipulation from opposing counsel as to an accurate translation. Thus, there is no occasion to consider whether Plaintiff's error could be rendered harmless by later events. <i>See United States v. Morales-Madera,</i> 352 F.3d 1, 7-11 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff next claims the district court erred in limiting her damage award to $12,000. Plaintiff raises the claim in her \"issues before the court\" section of her opening brief. Plaintiff's only other reference to the matter, however, is her broad statement that \"[i]f the ... Court had not excluded the testimony [of Dr. Alonso] ... the award in damages could ha[ve] been in a greater amount than $12,000.\" Plaintiff then speculates that her \"mental condition easily could be evaluated in an amount greater than $12,000.\" Plaintiff fails to provide any additional analysis regarding her damages issue. We have repeatedly held that \"issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\" <i>In re Gosselin,</i> 276 F.3d 70, 72 (1st Cir.2002)(internal quotation and citation omitted); <i>see also Mulvihill v. Top-Flite Golf Co.,</i> 335 F.3d 15, 27 (1st Cir.2003)(noting an issue is waived when \"the proponent mentions it as a possible argument in the most skeletal way, leaving the court to do counsel's work\") (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, given our prior holding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding Dr. Alonso's expert testimony, we need not discuss what effect Dr. Alonso's testimony <i>may have had</i> on Plaintiff's emotional damages award. To do so would constitute mere speculation and guesswork. The district court properly limited Plaintiff's damages for mental or emotional suffering because Plaintiff failed to present the testimony of a mental health expert. Although we have held that expert testimony is not necessarily required, \"the lack of such evidence is relevant <i>to the amount of the award.\" Koster v.

Plaintiff, who is originally from the Dominican Republic, alleged she was subjected to a hostile work environment on the basis of her national origin. After a bench trial, the district court concluded Plaintiff was subjected to a hostile work environment and awarded her $12,000 in damages. Thereafter, Plaintiff filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment, which the district court denied. Plaintiff appeals, arguing the district court erred in (1) excluding her psychiatric expert from testifying at trial, and (2) limiting her damage award to $12,000. We have jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291, and after reviewing the district court's decision to exclude expert testimony and its award of damages for an abuse of discretion, <i>see Willhauck v.

Suffice it to say, Plaintiff was born in the Dominican Republic and came to Puerto Rico in 1969. Plaintiff has worked at the Department of Family Affairs since 1989, and has been promoted several times. Between 1999 and 2000, Plaintiff's co-workers and supervisors, among other things, directed derogatory and disparaging comments and jokes towards Plaintiff because of her Dominican background. Plaintiff reported the offensive remarks to her supervisors, but they failed to remedy the situation. Plaintiff filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\").

After several delays, extensive discovery, and ruling on numerous motions, the district court set the bench-trial for December 1, 2003. On November 5, 2003, Defendant filed a motion in limine seeking to exclude the testimony of Plaintiff's expert witness and treating psychiatrist, Dr. Jos&#233; Alberto Alonso. Defendant argued (1) the identity of Plaintiff's expert witness had not been properly disclosed as required under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(1), (2) Plaintiff failed to provide a written expert report satisfying the requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(2)(B), and (3) the documents Dr. Alonso submitted were written in Spanish, rather than in English, and were thus inadmissible under the district court's local rules. The district court, without analysis, granted Defendant's motion in limine and excluded Dr. Alonso from testifying at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After trial, the district court issued its findings of fact and conclusions of law. The court concluded Defendant violated Title VII. In calculating damages, the court found \"because Pe&#241;a failed to present expert testimony from her psychiatrist, the Court will limit the amount of damages that she can receive for mental and/or emotional suffering.\" The court ultimately granted Plaintiff damages in the amount of $12,000. Plaintiff filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment, arguing, among other things, the district court erred in excluding her expert witness from testifying at trial and limiting the amount of her emotional damages. The district court denied Plaintiff's motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff argues the district court erred in excluding her expert witness, Dr. Alonso, from testifying at trial. Specifically, Plaintiff claims she fully disclosed Dr. Alonso's name as an expert witness almost six months prior to trial. Further, Plaintiff argues she satisfied the written expert report requirements under Rule 26(a)(2)(B) when she submitted Dr. Alonso's psychiatric evaluation, resume, and Plaintiff's medical records to Defendant on \"various occasions.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff timely disclosed Dr. Alonso as an expert witness.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Plaintiff, however, failed to provide a written expert report.
