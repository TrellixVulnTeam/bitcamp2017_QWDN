R. App. P. 43(c)(2), Attorney General Eric\nH. Holder, Jr. has been substituted for former Attorney General\nMichael B. Mukasey as the respondent.\n\f          LIPEZ, Circuit Judge. Petitioners Veasna Touch (\"Touch\")\n\nand Sokly Chat (\"Chat\"), citizens of Cambodia, seek review of a\n\ndecision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") denying their\n\napplications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under\n\nthe United Nations Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\").        Touch\n\nclaims that he was persecuted by Cambodian government forces and\n\nsupporters of the Cambodian People's Party on account of his\n\npolitical opinions, and that he will face persecution if he returns\n\nto Cambodia.   The BIA rejected these claims and found that, even if\n\nit credited Touch's testimony, he failed to sufficiently prove past\n\npersecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution.     Touch\n\nchallenges these determinations.\n\n          Concluding that the evidence before the BIA did not\n\ncompel it to find otherwise, we deny the petition.\n\n                                   I\n\n          On September 22, 2000, Touch entered the United States as\n\na nonimmigrant, with authorization to remain until March 21, 2001.\n\nOn March 5, 2001, he was joined by petitioner Chat, his wife.\n\nTouch filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal on\n\nJune 7,   2001, listing Chat as a derivative applicant.1        The\n\n\n\n     1\n          Because Chat is a derivative applicant, her eligibility\nfor asylum depends on the status of her husband, Touch.     See 8\nU.S.C. ยง 1158(b)(3)(A); Ymeri v. Ashcroft, 387 F.3d 12, 14 (1st\nCir. 2004) (\"[The applicant] filed an asylum application, and the\nother family members rely on his application as derivative\napplicants.\").\n\n                                 -2-\n\fDepartment of Homeland Security served both petitioners with a\n\nNotice to Appear and charged them with removability.               At a hearing\n\nheld in April 2004, Touch and Chat conceded removability but\n\nrenewed their claims for asylum and withholding of removal, and\n\nrequested relief under CAT.\n\n           According      to   evidence    before      the   immigration   judge\n\n(\"IJ\"),   Cambodia   is    a   constitutional       monarchy     whose   elected\n\ngovernment is controlled by the Cambodian People's Party (\"CPP\").\n\nAfter elections in 1993, CPP formed a coalition with a rival party,\n\nthe National United Front for a Neutral, Peaceful, Cooperative, and\n\nIndependent Cambodia (\"FUNCINPEC\").            The coalition broke down in\n\n1997, when the CPP leader, Hun Sen, led a violent coup against the\n\ngovernment, removing FUNCINPEC leaders and arresting and killing\n\ntheir supporters.      Elections in 1998 again led to violence, when\n\ngovernment forces and CPP supporters clashed with supporters of\n\nFUNCINPEC and another rival political party, the Sam Rainsy party.\n\nToday CPP still dominates the parliament, where Hun Sen serves as\n\nprime minister.\n\n           Touch   testified     that     he   first    became   interested   in\n\nCambodian politics in 1993, after discussions with his brother-in-\n\nlaw, Dak Savy, who was secretary of the FUNCINPEC party at the\n\ntime. These discussions prompted Touch to join FUNCINPEC and begin\n\ncampaigning on their behalf.              In the period before the 1993\n\nelections, Touch spent twenty hours a week campaigning, sometimes\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fdelivering speeches in support of FUNCINPEC.               Touch regularly\n\nreceived threats from CPP supporters for his political activity.\n\nIn March 1993, Touch and others spoke at a campaign event at the\n\nKropom Chouk commune.       During the event, a group of seven or eight\n\nindividuals    got   up   and   left,    evidently    displeased   with     the\n\nspeakers. Later, when Touch and the other campaigners were driving\n\nhome, the group appeared on the side of the road and fired on the\n\ncampaigners' car.     Touch escaped serious injury by diving to the\n\ncar floor.     The driver of the car, however, was shot in the\n\nshoulder, and another occupant was shot in the back.\n\n          In    August     1993,   two    uniformed    soldiers    riding    a\n\nmotorcycle threw a grenade at Touch's car, shouting, \"this is your\n\ngift for helping the FUNCINPEC party.\"         Touch was able to avoid the\n\ngrenade by braking.       It exploded and blew out his front left front\n\ntire and damaged the front of the car.          Touch was not injured.\n\n          After the 1993 elections, Touch received a job through\n\nhis brother-in-law at the Cambodian Ministry of the Interior.\n\nTouch held this position for over four years, until July 1997, when\n\nhe left in the wake of the coup led by Hun Sen.          Concerned that he\n\nmight be targeted by CPP forces, Touch and his family fled Phnom\n\nPenh for the Kandal province.           Touch remained there for three or\n\nfour months.\n\n          Sometime after his return to Phnom Penh, in 1998, Touch\n\nchanged political affiliations and joined the Sam Rainsy party. In\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fpreparation       for   national   elections    in    July,    Touch   collected\n\ndonations and participated in Sam Rainsy campaign events.                   The CPP\n\nwon the election.         Months of political unrest followed.               Touch\n\nparticipated in a series of political demonstrations in early\n\nSeptember 1998, protesting the election results.                In the first of\n\nthese demonstrations, held on September 7 at the railroad station\n\nnear the University of Medicine, Touch spoke to a crowd of around\n\n1,000 people. At some point, police fired on the demonstrators and\n\ndrove   a   car    into   the   crowd,    killing    several    people.      Touch\n\ntestified that he was hit by the car, but managed to escape in the\n\nconfusion.        At    another    demonstration     held     the   same    day   at\n\nIndependence Monument, Touch was tied up, beaten, and forced to\n\ndrink wastewater by the police.           He later became sick as a result.\n\n            The next day, September 8, Touch joined a demonstration\n\nof 3,000 individuals, including students and Buddhist monks.                      He\n\nwas arrested by a police officer and beaten.             Touch again joined a\n\ndemonstration on September 9, when 2,000 people marched from the\n\nU.S. Embassy to the Cambodian National Assembly.                Touch carried a\n\nbanner calling Hun Sen a \"traitor\" and demanding that he step down.\n\nWhen police attacked the demonstrators, an officer struck Touch\n\nwith the butt of his rifle, causing him to collapse.                He managed to\n\nescape and again fled to a village in Kandal province.                     However,\n\nthat night two police officers came to Touch and Chat's home in\n\nPhnom Penh.        They questioned Chat at gun point about Touch's\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fwhereabouts, and threatened to kill Touch when they found him.\n\nChat urinated on herself in fear.          The police stayed for thirty\n\nminutes and searched the home, but they did not harm Chat.            She\n\nfled to her mother's house the next day, where she stayed for two\n\nweeks.\n\n           Touch remained in Kandal province for three months. When\n\nhe returned to Phnom Penh, he shuttled between his mother's and\n\nsisters' homes.    The police never returned to look for him.         For\n\nthe next two years, Touch continued to work for the Sam Rainsy\n\nparty and assisted his wife with her business.         In 2000 he obtained\n\na passport through political associates who worked at the passport\n\noffice.   On September 21, 2000, Touch boarded a flight and entered\n\nthe United States the next day.      He testified that he has not been\n\ninterested in Cambodian politics since his arrival in the United\n\nStates.\n\n           On June 13, 2006, the IJ issued an opinion finding Touch\n\nnot credible and denying his application for asylum, withholding of\n\nremoval, and relief under CAT.            Touch and Chat appealed.     On\n\nJanuary   31,   2008,   the   BIA    reversed    the    IJ's   credibility\n\ndetermination, but affirmed her order denying relief.            It found\n\nthat even if the applicants' testimony were credited, they had\n\nfailed to prove past persecution or a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution.    This petition for review followed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\f                                      II\n\n            When the BIA adopts aspects of the IJ's opinion, we\n\nreview those portions of the opinion in addition to the BIA\n\ndecision itself.         Rivas-Mira v. Holder, 556 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.\n\n2009).     In contrast, \"[w]hen the BIA issues its own opinion, we\n\nreview the Board's decision and not the immigration judge's.\"\n\nGeorcely v. Ashcroft, 375 F.3d 45, 49 (1st Cir. 2004); Albathani v.\n\nI.N.S., 318 F.3d 365, 373 (1st Cir. 2003) (\"Ordinarily, Courts of\n\nAppeals review decisions of the [BIA], and not those of an IJ.\n\nWhen the BIA does not render its own opinion, however, and either\n\ndefers [to] or adopts the opinion of the IJ, a Court of Appeals\n\nmust then review the decision of the IJ.\" (internal quotation\n\nmarks, footnote, and citation omitted)).\n\n            The standard of review for claims of asylum, withholding\n\nof removal, and relief under the CAT is \"substantial evidence.\"\n\nRashad v. Mukasey, 554 F.3d. 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2009).                Under this\n\nstandard, we do not disturb findings if they are \"'supported by\n\nreasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record\n\nconsidered as a whole.'\"          Segran v. Mukasey, 511 F.3d 1, 5 (1st\n\nCir. 2007) (quoting INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481\n\n(1992)). This is a difficult standard for petitioners to surmount.\n\nWe reverse only if \"'any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled\n\nto conclude to the contrary.'\"         Tobon-Marin v. Mukasey, 512 F.3d\n\n28,   30   (1st   Cir.    2008)   (quoting   8   U.S.C.   ยง   1252(b)(4)(B)).\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f\"[V]acatur requires that the evidence point unerringly in the\n\nopposite direction.\"       Bocova v. Gonzales, 412 F.3d 257, 262 (1st\n\nCir. 2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\nA. Asylum and Withholding of Removal\n\n            Asylum is a discretionary form of relief, available only\n\nto an individual who can prove that he is a \"refugee\" within the\n\nmeaning of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"). Bonilla v.\n\nMukasey,    539   F.3d   72,   78    (1st       Cir.   2008)   (citing    8   U.S.C.\n\nยง 1158(b)(1)).     Under the INA, a \"refugee\" is a person outside his\n\ncountry of nationality who is \"unable or unwilling to return to\n\n. . . that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of\n\npersecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership\n\nin a particular social group, or political opinion.\"                     8 U.S.C. ยง\n\n1101(a)(42)(A). Proof that persecution has a ten percent chance of\n\noccurring suffices to make a fear of persecution \"well-founded.\"\n\nSee I.N.S. v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 440 (1987).\n\n            Proof of past persecution raises a rebuttable presumption\n\nof a well-founded fear of future persecution. Hernandez-Barrera v.\n\nAshcroft, 373 F.3d 9, 21 (1st Cir. 2004).               That presumption may be\n\ndefeated only if the government demonstrates, by a preponderance,\n\neither:     (1)   that   there      has    been    a    fundamental      change   in\n\ncircumstances such that the applicant no longer has a well-founded\n\nfear   of   persecution,   or    (2)      that    the   applicant     could    avoid\n\n\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fpersecution     by      relocating    to   another        part    of   the    country       of\n\nnationality.       Id.\n\n          1. Past Persecution\n\n          Proving past persecution is a \"'daunting task.'\" Butt v.\n\nKeisler, 506 F.3d 86, 90 (1st Cir. 2007) (quoting Alibeaj v.\n\nGonzales, 469 F.3d 188, 191 (1st Cir. 2006)).                          The mistreatment\n\ncomplained    of     must    have    \"reached    a    fairly      high      threshold       of\n\nseriousness, as well as some regularity or frequency.\"                             Id.     \"An\n\nimportant factor in determining whether [mistreatment amounts to\n\npersecution]       is    whether     the   mistreatment          can   be    said     to    be\n\nsystematic     rather       than    reflective       of    a     series      of    isolated\n\nincidents.\"     Bocova, 412 F.3d at 263 (citing In re O-Z & I-Z, 22 I\n\n& N Dec. 23, 26 (BIA 1998)).                 \"[M]istreatment ordinarily must\n\nentail   more        than    sporadic      abuse     in        order    to        constitute\n\npersecution.\"        Id.; Guzman v. I.N.S., 327 F.3d 11, 15-16 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).\n\n          In this case, the BIA concluded that petitioner failed to\n\nestablish that the March 1993 incident was on account of political\n\nopinion, that any presumption of a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution created by the August 1993 incident was rebutted, and\n\nthat the incidents of September 1998, including the unfulfilled\n\nthreat against Touch, did not amount to persecution.                              Petitioner\n\nchallenges each one of these determinations.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\f          a. The March        1993   shooting    was    not    on   account   of\npolitical opinion\n\n           Regarding the March 1993 incident, Touch testified to the\n\nIJ that he had been speaking at a political meeting, and that 7 or\n\n8 individuals walked out of the meeting because \"they don't like\n\nour speech.\"     Later, those same individuals shot at the car in\n\nwhich Touch was riding. Although this testimony certainly suggests\n\nthat the shooters attacked Touch on account of his political\n\nopinions, we may reverse only if the BIA was compelled to draw that\n\nconclusion.     See Tobon-Marin, 512 F.3d at 31 (concluding that\n\nmotive was not sufficiently proven because it remained possible to\n\nexplain the attackers' conduct in another way). Here, the IJ noted\n\nthat   other   explanations   for    the    attack    were    possible.   \"The\n\nattackers did not wear any uniform and did not say anything to\n\nrespondent.     It is at least as likely that the attackers were\n\ncommon thieves as government forces.                 The connection between\n\nrespondent's campaigning . . . and the actual shooting is mere\n\nspeculation.\"    The evidence does not compel a contrary conclusion.\n\n          b. Any presumption resulting from the August 1993 event\nwas rebutted by subsequent events\n\n           The BIA's conclusions about the incident in August 1993\n\nare also supported by substantial evidence.                  While the grenade\n\nattack was undoubtedly serious, there was evidence refuting any\n\npresumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution.                 Touch\n\ntestified that after the August 1993 attack, he retained his job at\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fthe Cambodian Ministry of the Interior. He also remained an active\n\nFUNCINPEC member.      In fact, Touch testified to no incidents of\n\nmistreatment during the next five years, until 1998, when he\n\nswitched political parties.       A long period without mistreatment\n\nfollowed by disassociation with the target political organization\n\nsupports the BIA's conclusion that the August 1993 attack does not\n\ngive Touch reason to fear future persecution.            See Pieterson v.\n\nAshcroft, 364 F.3d 38, 41, 45 (1st Cir. 2004) (affirming the BIA\n\nwhere the applicant could point to no acts of persecution against\n\nher during a five-year period in which she was uninvolved in\n\npolitics).\n\n          c. The events of September 7, 8, and 9 do not amount to\npersecution\n\n           The BIA's conclusion that Touch's mistreatment during the\n\nprotests of September 7, 8 and 9 did not rise to the level of\n\npersecution was supported by substantial evidence.              As the IJ\n\npointed out, the government's mistreatment of Touch was largely a\n\n\"spasmodic\" response to his participation in the protests.            See\n\nGuzman,   327   F.3d   at   15.   Moreover,   although    the   government\n\nunquestionably mistreated Touch during the protests -- beating him\n\nand forcing him to drink wastewater -- Touch did not suffer serious\n\nor permanent injuries.      Albeaj v. Gonzales, 469 F.3d 188, 192 (1st\n\nCir. 2006) (\"[A]lthough the police beat Albeaj during a pro-\n\ndemocracy demonstration in 1990, . . . Albeaj never testified to\n\nany permanent or serious injuries.\").      On this record, the BIA was\n\n                                  -11-\n\fnot compelled to conclude that the government's conduct during the\n\nSeptember demonstrations amounted to persecution.\n\n          The most serious of the events of September 1998 was the\n\nthreat against Touch's life on September 9.     Unfulfilled threats\n\nrarely prove past persecution, being construed more naturally as\n\nevidence of a well-founded fear of future persecution. Lim v. INS,\n\n224 F.3d 929, 936   (9th Cir. 2000).   Such threats are evidence of\n\npast persecution \"[i]n certain extreme cases, . . . particularly\n\nwhere those threats are combined with confrontation or other\n\nmistreatment.\"   Id.   The unfulfilled threat must be \"'so menacing\n\nas to cause significant actual suffering or harm.'\" Butt, 506 F.3d\n\nat 91 (quoting Lim, 224 F.3d at 936); see also Tamara-Gomez v.\n\nGonzales, 447 F.3d 343, 346-47, 349 (5th Cir. 2006) (finding past\n\npersecution where the FARC regularly threatened the applicant with\n\ndeath, told his wife they would kill him and kidnap their sons,\n\nbombed his neighborhood, broke into and vandalized his home, and\n\ntracked and murdered several of his associates); Li v. Atty Gen. of\n\nthe U.S., 400 F.3d 157, 164-65 (3d Cir. 2005).\n\n          While there is no doubt that the threat to Touch was\n\nserious, the BIA was not compelled to conclude that it rose to the\n\nlevel of persecution. Although Chat was understandably scared, she\n\nwas not harmed during the encounter with the police officers.   The\n\nofficers never returned to their home, and never threatened Touch\n\nor his family again.   When Touch returned to Phnom Penh after three\n\n\n                                -12-\n\fmonths in hiding, he again became politically active, collecting\n\nfood and money for the Sam Rainsy party and attending meetings at\n\nparty headquarters.          The BIA thus had substantial evidence to\n\nconclude that the threat was not extreme enough to rise to the\n\nlevel of persecution.        See Lim, 224 F.3d at 936 (concluding that a\n\nthreat did not rise to the level of persecution where \"Lim carried\n\non for six years without harm and without fleeing\").\n\n            Notably, the BIA appears to have viewed the record in\n\nthis case as showing a number of serious isolated incidents, rather\n\nthan systematic political persecution.                 More than five years\n\nseparated the events of August 1993 from those of September 1998.\n\nAs   the   BIA   pointed     out,   Touch    worked   in   the   government   and\n\ncontinued to be politically active during this time. After the\n\nevents of September 1998, Touch remained in Cambodia without\n\nincident for two more years.           It has now been eight years since\n\nTouch left Cambodia, and his family there has not been mistreated\n\nin that time.      He is no longer politically active.            Considered as\n\na whole, this record does not compel the conclusion that Touch has\n\nbeen subject to a \"pattern of targeted political harassment.\"\n\nTopalli, 417 F.3d at 132.\n\n            For these reasons, we find that the BIA's determination\n\nthat   Touch     did   not   suffer   past    persecution    is   supported    by\n\nsubstantial evidence.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\f            2. Future Persecution\n\n            To prove a \"well-founded fear of future persecution,\" an\n\napplicant    must    show    that     his   fear   of    persecution    is     both\n\nsubjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.                See Bocova, 412\n\nF.3d at 262.        In this case, the BIA noted that Touch and Chat\n\n\"continued    to    live    without    incident    for    a   prolonged      period\n\nfollowing the September 1998 police threat,\" that Touch \"had no\n\nproblems in leaving his homeland\" or obtaining a visa, and that\n\nTouch currently has no interest in Cambodian politics.                 Moreover,\n\n\"[t]here has been no showing that anyone, including the police or\n\nany Cambodian official, is currently interested in either [Touch or\n\nChat] for any reason, much less based on their political views or\n\nthe political activities last engaged in by [Touch] over 7 years\n\nago.\"    The BIA held that this record does not establish a well\n\nfounded fear of being persecuted upon returning to Cambodia.                   The\n\nevidence does not compel a contrary result.\n\n            We     need    not   independently     reach      the   question     of\n\nwithholding of removal.          The standard of proof required for asylum\n\n(\"well-founded fear of persecution\") is less stringent than that\n\nrequired for withholding of removal (\"more likely than not to face\n\npersecution\").      See Salazar v. Ashcroft, 359 F.3d 45, 52 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).      It follows that if an applicant is unable to prove\n\neligibility for asylum, the applicant will be unable to prove\n\neligibility for withholding of removal.

Touch claims that he was persecuted by Cambodian government forces and supporters of the Cambodian People's Party on account of his political opinions, and that he will face persecution if he returns to Cambodia. The BIA rejected these claims and found that, even if it <span class=\"star-pagination\">*36</span> credited Touch's testimony, he failed to sufficiently prove past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. Touch challenges these determinations.</p>\n<p>Concluding that the evidence before the BIA did not compel it to find otherwise, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>On September 22, 2000, Touch entered the United States as a nonimmigrant, with authorization to remain until March 21, 2001. On March 5, 2001, he was joined by petitioner Chat, his wife. Touch filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal on June 7, 2001, listing Chat as a derivative applicant.<sup>[1]</sup> The Department of Homeland Security served both petitioners with a Notice to Appear and charged them with removability. At a hearing held in April 2004, Touch and Chat conceded removability but renewed their claims for asylum and withholding of removal, and requested relief under CAT.</p>\n<p>According to evidence before the immigration judge (\"IJ\"), Cambodia is a constitutional monarchy whose elected government is controlled by the Cambodian People's Party (\"CPP\"). After elections in 1993, CPP formed a coalition with a rival party, the National United Front for a Neutral, Peaceful, Cooperative, and Independent Cambodia (\"FUNCINPEC\"). The coalition broke down in 1997, when the CPP leader, Hun Sen, led a violent coup against the government, removing FUNCINPEC leaders and arresting and killing their supporters. Elections in 1998 again led to violence, when government forces and CPP supporters clashed with supporters of FUNCINPEC and another rival political party, the Sam Rainsy party. Today CPP still dominates the parliament, where Hun Sen serves as prime minister.</p>\n<p>Touch testified that he first became interested in Cambodian politics in 1993, after discussions with his brother-in-law, Dak Savy, who was secretary of the FUNCINPEC party at the time. These discussions prompted Touch to join FUNCINPEC and begin campaigning on their behalf. In the period before the 1993 elections, Touch spent twenty hours a week campaigning, sometimes delivering speeches in support of FUNCINPEC. Touch regularly received threats from CPP supporters for his political activity. In March 1993, Touch and others spoke at a campaign event at the Kropom Chouk commune. During the event, a group of seven or eight individuals got up and left, evidently displeased with the speakers. Later, when Touch and the other campaigners were driving home, the group appeared on the side of the road and fired on the campaigners' car. Touch escaped serious injury by diving to the car floor. The driver of the car, however, was shot in the shoulder, and another occupant was shot in the back.</p>\n<p>In August 1993, two uniformed soldiers riding a motorcycle threw a grenade at Touch's car, shouting, \"this is your gift for helping the FUNCINPEC party.\" Touch was able to avoid the grenade by braking. It exploded and blew out his front left front tire and damaged the front of the car. Touch was not injured.</p>\n<p>After the 1993 elections, Touch received a job through his brother-in-law at the Cambodian Ministry of the Interior. Touch held this position for over four <span class=\"star-pagination\">*37</span> years, until July 1997, when he left in the wake of the coup led by Hun Sen. Concerned that he might be targeted by CPP forces, Touch and his family fled Phnom Penh for the Kandal province. Touch remained there for three or four months.</p>\n<p>Sometime after his return to Phnom Penh, in 1998, Touch changed political affiliations and joined the Sam Rainsy party. In preparation for national elections in July, Touch collected donations and participated in Sam Rainsy campaign events. The CPP won the election. Months of political unrest followed. Touch participated in a series of political demonstrations in early September 1998, protesting the election results. In the first of these demonstrations, held on September 7 at the railroad station near the University of Medicine, Touch spoke to a crowd of around 1,000 people. At some point, police fired on the demonstrators and drove a car into the crowd, killing several people. Touch testified that he was hit by the car, but managed to escape in the confusion. At another demonstration held the same day at Independence Monument, Touch was tied up, beaten, and forced to drink wastewater by the police. He later became sick as a result.</p>\n<p>The next day, September 8, Touch joined a demonstration of 3,000 individuals, including students and Buddhist monks. He was arrested by a police officer and beaten. Touch again joined a demonstration on September 9, when 2,000 people marched from the U.S. Embassy to the Cambodian National Assembly. Touch carried a banner calling Hun Sen a \"traitor\" and demanding that he step down. When police attacked the demonstrators, an officer struck Touch with the butt of his rifle, causing him to collapse. He managed to escape and again fled to a village in Kandal province. However, that night two police officers came to Touch and Chat's home in Phnom Penh. They questioned Chat at gun point about Touch's whereabouts, and threatened to kill Touch when they found him. Chat urinated on herself in fear. The police stayed for thirty minutes and searched the home, but they did not harm Chat. She fled to her mother's house the next day, where she stayed for two weeks.</p>\n<p>Touch remained in Kandal province for three months. When he returned to Phnom Penh, he shuttled between his mother's and sisters' homes. The police never returned to look for him. For the next two years, Touch continued to work for the Sam Rainsy party and assisted his wife with her business. In 2000 he obtained a passport through political associates who worked at the passport office. On September 21, 2000, Touch boarded a flight and entered the United States the next day. He testified that he has not been interested in Cambodian politics since his arrival in the United States.</p>\n<p>On June 13, 2006, the IJ issued an opinion finding Touch not credible and denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under CAT. Touch and Chat appealed. On January 31, 2008, the BIA reversed the IJ's credibility determination, but affirmed her order denying relief. It found that even if the applicants' testimony were credited, they had failed to prove past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. This petition for review followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>When the BIA adopts aspects of the IJ's opinion, we review those portions of the opinion in addition to the BIA decision itself. <i>Rivas-Mira v. Holder,</i> 556 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2009). In contrast, \"[w]hen the BIA issues its own opinion, we review the Board's decision and not the immigration judge's.\" <i>Georcely v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*38</span> 375 F.3d 45, 49 (1st Cir.2004); <i>Albathani v. I.N.S.,</i> 318 F.3d 365, 373 (1st Cir.2003) (\"Ordinarily, Courts of Appeals review decisions of the [BIA], and not those of an IJ. When the BIA does not render its own opinion, however, and either defers [to] or adopts the opinion of the IJ, a Court of Appeals must then review the decision of the IJ.\" (internal quotation marks, footnote, and citation omitted)).</p>\n<p>The standard of review for claims of asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the CAT is \"substantial evidence.\" <i>Rashad v. Mukasey,</i> 554 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2009). Under this standard, we do not disturb findings if they are \"`supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.'\" <i>Segran v. Mukasey,</i> 511 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2007) (quoting <i>INS v. Elias-Zacarias,</i> 502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)). This is a difficult standard for petitioners to surmount. We reverse only if \"`any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.'\" <i>Tobon-Marin v. Mukasey,</i> 512 F.3d 28, 30 (1st Cir.2008) (quoting 8 U.S.C. ยง 1252(b)(4)(B)). \"[V]acatur requires that the evidence point unerringly in the opposite direction.\" <i>Bocova v. Gonzales,</i> 412 F.3d 257, 262 (1st Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Asylum and Withholding of Removal</h2>\n<p>Asylum is a discretionary form of relief, available only to an individual who can prove that he is a \"refugee\" within the meaning of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"). <i>Bonilla v. Mukasey,</i> 539 F.3d 72, 78 (1st Cir.2008) (citing 8 U.S.C. ยง 1158(b)(1)). Under the INA, a \"refugee\" is a person outside his country of nationality who is \"unable or unwilling to return to . . . that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" 8 U.S.C. ยง 1101(a)(42)(A). Proof that persecution has a ten percent chance of occurring suffices to make a fear of persecution \"well-founded.\" <i>See </i><i>I.N.S. v. Cardoza-Fonseca,</i> 480 U.S. 421, 440, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987).</p>\n<p>Proof of past persecution raises a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. <i>Hernandez-Barrera v. Ashcroft,</i> 373 F.3d 9, 21 (1st Cir.2004). That presumption may be defeated only if the government demonstrates, by a preponderance, either: (1) that there has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution, or (2) that the applicant could avoid persecution by relocating to another part of the country of nationality. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Past Persecution</h2>\n<p>Proving past persecution is a \"`daunting task.'\" <i>Butt v. Keisler,</i> 506 F.3d 86, 90 (1st Cir.2007) (quoting <i>Alibeaj v. Gonzales,</i> 469 F.3d 188, 191 (1st Cir. 2006)). The mistreatment complained of must have \"reached a fairly high threshold of seriousness, as well as some regularity or frequency.\" <i>Id.</i> \"An important factor in determining whether [mistreatment amounts to persecution] is whether the mistreatment can be said to be systematic rather than reflective of a series of isolated incidents.\" <i>Bocova,</i> 412 F.3d at 263 (citing <i>In re O-Z &amp; I-Z,</i> 22 I &amp; N Dec. 23, 26 (BIA 1998)). \"[M]istreatment ordinarily must entail more than sporadic abuse in order to constitute persecution.\" <i>Id.; </i><i>Guzman v. I.N.S.,</i> 327 F.3d 11, 15-16 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*39</span> In this case, the BIA concluded that petitioner failed to establish that the March 1993 incident was on account of political opinion, that any presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution created by the August 1993 incident was rebutted, and that the incidents of September 1998, including the unfulfilled threat against Touch, did not amount to persecution. Petitioner challenges each one of these determinations.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. The March 1993 shooting was not on account of political opinion</h2>\n<p>Regarding the March 1993 incident, Touch testified to the IJ that he had been speaking at a political meeting, and that 7 or 8 individuals walked out of the meeting because \"they don't like our speech.\" Later, those same individuals shot at the car in which Touch was riding. Although this testimony certainly suggests that the shooters attacked Touch on account of his political opinions, we may reverse only if the BIA was <i>compelled</i> to draw that conclusion. <i>See </i><i>Tobon-Marin,</i> 512 F.3d at 31 (concluding that motive was not sufficiently proven because it remained possible to explain the attackers' conduct in another way). Here, the IJ noted that other explanations for the attack were possible. \"The attackers did not wear any uniform and did not say anything to respondent. It is at least as likely that the attackers were common thieves as government forces. The connection between respondent's campaigning . . . and the actual shooting is mere speculation.\" The evidence does not compel a contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. Any presumption resulting from the August 1993 event was rebutted by subsequent events</h2>\n<p>The BIA's conclusions about the incident in August 1993 are also supported by substantial evidence. While the grenade attack was undoubtedly serious, there was evidence refuting any presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. Touch testified that after the August 1993 attack, he retained his job at the Cambodian Ministry of the Interior. He also remained an active FUNCINPEC member. In fact, Touch testified to no incidents of mistreatment during the next five years, until 1998, when he switched political parties. A long period without mistreatment followed by disassociation with the target political organization supports the BIA's conclusion that the August 1993 attack does not give Touch reason to fear future persecution. <i>See </i><i>Pieterson v. Ashcroft,</i> 364 F.3d 38, 41, 45 (1st Cir.2004) (affirming the BIA where the applicant could point to no acts of persecution against her during a five-year period in which she was uninvolved in politics).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>c. The events of September 7, 8, and 9 do not amount to persecution</h2>\n<p>The BIA's conclusion that Touch's mistreatment during the protests of September 7, 8 and 9 did not rise to the level of persecution was supported by substantial evidence. As the IJ pointed out, the government's mistreatment of Touch was largely a \"spasmodic\" response to his participation in the protests. <i>See </i><i>Guzman,</i> 327 F.3d at 15. Moreover, although the government unquestionably mistreated Touch during the protests ย beating him and forcing him to drink wastewater ย Touch did not suffer serious or permanent injuries. <i>Alibeaj v. Gonzales,</i> 469 F.3d 188, 192 (1st Cir.2006) (\"[A]lthough the police beat Alibeaj during a pro-democracy demonstration in 1990, . . . Alibeaj never testified to any permanent or serious injuries.\"). On this record, the BIA was not compelled to conclude that the government's conduct during the September demonstrations amounted to persecution.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*40</span> The most serious of the events of September 1998 was the threat against Touch's life on September 9. Unfulfilled threats rarely prove past persecution, being construed more naturally as evidence of a well-founded fear of future persecution. <i>Lim v. INS,</i> 224 F.3d 929, 936 (9th Cir.2000). Such threats are evidence of past persecution \"[i]n certain extreme cases, . . . particularly where those threats are combined with confrontation or other mistreatment.\" <i>Id.</i> The unfulfilled threat must be \"`so menacing as to cause significant actual suffering or harm.'\" <i>Butt,</i> 506 F.3d at 91 (quoting <i>Lim,</i> 224 F.3d at 936); <i>see also </i><i>Tamara-Gomez v. Gonzales,</i> 447 F.3d 343, 346-47, 349 (5th Cir.2006) (finding past persecution where the FARC regularly threatened the applicant with death, told his wife they would kill him and kidnap their sons, bombed his neighborhood, broke into and vandalized his home, and tracked and murdered several of his associates); <i>Li v. Atty. Gen. of the U.S.,</i> 400 F.3d 157, 164-65 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>While there is no doubt that the threat to Touch was serious, the BIA was not compelled to conclude that it rose to the level of persecution. Although Chat was understandably scared, she was not harmed during the encounter with the police officers. The officers never returned to their home, and never threatened Touch or his family again. When Touch returned to Phnom Penh after three months in hiding, he again became politically active, collecting food and money for the Sam Rainsy party and attending meetings at party headquarters. The BIA thus had substantial evidence to conclude that the threat was not extreme enough to rise to the level of persecution. <i>See </i><i>Lim,</i> 224 F.3d at 936 (concluding that a threat did not rise to the level of persecution where \"Lim carried on for six years without harm and without fleeing\").</p>\n<p>Notably, the BIA appears to have viewed the record in this case as showing a number of serious isolated incidents, rather than systematic political persecution. More than five years separated the events of August 1993 from those of September 1998. As the BIA pointed out, Touch worked in the government and continued to be politically active during this time. After the events of September 1998, Touch remained in Cambodia without incident for two more years. It has now been eight years since Touch left Cambodia, and his family there has not been mistreated in that time. He is no longer politically active. Considered as a whole, this record does not compel the conclusion that Touch has been subject to a \"pattern of targeted political harassment.\" <i>Topalli,</i> 417 F.3d at 132.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, we find that the BIA's determination that Touch did not suffer past persecution is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Future Persecution</h2>\n<p>To prove a \"well-founded fear of future persecution,\" an applicant must show that his fear of persecution is both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable. <i>See </i><i>Bocova,</i> 412 F.3d at 262. In this case, the BIA noted that Touch and Chat \"continued to live without incident for a prolonged period following the September 1998 police threat,\" that Touch \"had no problems in leaving his homeland\" or obtaining a visa, and that Touch currently has no interest in Cambodian politics. Moreover, \"[t]here has been no showing that anyone, including the police or any Cambodian official, is currently interested in either [Touch or Chat] for any reason, much less based on their political views or the political activities last engaged in by [Touch] over 7 years ago.\" The BIA held that this record does not establish <span class=\"star-pagination\">*41</span> a well founded fear of being persecuted upon returning to Cambodia. The evidence does not compel a contrary result.</p>\n<p>We need not independently reach the question of withholding of removal. The standard of proof required for asylum (\"well-founded fear of persecution\") is less stringent than that required for withholding of removal (\"more likely than not to face persecution\"). <i>See </i><i>Salazar v. Ashcroft,</i> 359 F.3d 45, 52 (1st Cir.2004). It follows that if an applicant is unable to prove eligibility for asylum, the applicant will be unable to prove eligibility for withholding of removal. <i>Bocova,</i> 412 F.3d at 262.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Convention Against Torture</h2>\n<p>Touch also asks us to reverse the determination that he did not qualify for relief under CAT. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. ยง 1231; 8 C.F.R. ยง 1208.16(c). However, Touch fails to develop any argument to this end in his brief. For this reason, we deem the argument waived. <i>See </i><i>Negeya v. Gonzales,</i> 417 F.3d 78, 85 (1st Cir.2005); <i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n<p>The petition for review is <i>denied.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 43(c)(2), Attorney General Eric H.

The coalition broke down in 1997, when the CPP leader, Hun Sen, led a violent coup against the government, removing FUNCINPEC leaders and arresting and killing their supporters. Elections in 1998 again led to violence, when government forces and CPP supporters clashed with supporters of FUNCINPEC and another rival political party, the Sam Rainsy party. Today CPP still dominates the parliament, where Hun Sen serves as prime minister.</p>\n<p>Touch testified that he first became interested in Cambodian politics in 1993, after discussions with his brother-in-law, Dak Savy, who was secretary of the FUNCINPEC party at the time. These discussions prompted Touch to join FUNCINPEC and begin campaigning on their behalf. In the period before the 1993 elections, Touch spent twenty hours a week campaigning, sometimes delivering speeches in support of FUNCINPEC. Touch regularly received threats from CPP supporters for his political activity. In March 1993, Touch and others spoke at a campaign event at the Kropom Chouk commune. During the event, a group of seven or eight individuals got up and left, evidently displeased with the speakers. Later, when Touch and the other campaigners were driving home, the group appeared on the side of the road and fired on the campaigners' car. Touch escaped serious injury by diving to the car floor. The driver of the car, however, was shot in the shoulder, and another occupant was shot in the back.</p>\n<p>In August 1993, two uniformed soldiers riding a motorcycle threw a grenade at Touch's car, shouting, \"this is your gift for helping the FUNCINPEC party.\" Touch was able to avoid the grenade by braking. It exploded and blew out his front left front tire and damaged the front of the car. Touch was not injured.</p>\n<p>After the 1993 elections, Touch received a job through his brother-in-law at the Cambodian Ministry of the Interior. Touch held this position for over four <span class=\"star-pagination\">*37</span> years, until July 1997, when he left in the wake of the coup led by Hun Sen. Concerned that he might be targeted by CPP forces, Touch and his family fled Phnom Penh for the Kandal province. Touch remained there for three or four months.</p>\n<p>Sometime after his return to Phnom Penh, in 1998, Touch changed political affiliations and joined the Sam Rainsy party. In preparation for national elections in July, Touch collected donations and participated in Sam Rainsy campaign events. The CPP won the election. Months of political unrest followed. Touch participated in a series of political demonstrations in early September 1998, protesting the election results. In the first of these demonstrations, held on September 7 at the railroad station near the University of Medicine, Touch spoke to a crowd of around 1,000 people. At some point, police fired on the demonstrators and drove a car into the crowd, killing several people. Touch testified that he was hit by the car, but managed to escape in the confusion. At another demonstration held the same day at Independence Monument, Touch was tied up, beaten, and forced to drink wastewater by the police. He later became sick as a result.</p>\n<p>The next day, September 8, Touch joined a demonstration of 3,000 individuals, including students and Buddhist monks. He was arrested by a police officer and beaten. Touch again joined a demonstration on September 9, when 2,000 people marched from the U.S. Embassy to the Cambodian National Assembly. Touch carried a banner calling Hun Sen a \"traitor\" and demanding that he step down. When police attacked the demonstrators, an officer struck Touch with the butt of his rifle, causing him to collapse. He managed to escape and again fled to a village in Kandal province. However, that night two police officers came to Touch and Chat's home in Phnom Penh. They questioned Chat at gun point about Touch's whereabouts, and threatened to kill Touch when they found him. Chat urinated on herself in fear. The police stayed for thirty minutes and searched the home, but they did not harm Chat. She fled to her mother's house the next day, where she stayed for two weeks.</p>\n<p>Touch remained in Kandal province for three months. When he returned to Phnom Penh, he shuttled between his mother's and sisters' homes. The police never returned to look for him. For the next two years, Touch continued to work for the Sam Rainsy party and assisted his wife with her business. In 2000 he obtained a passport through political associates who worked at the passport office. On September 21, 2000, Touch boarded a flight and entered the United States the next day. He testified that he has not been interested in Cambodian politics since his arrival in the United States.</p>\n<p>On June 13, 2006, the IJ issued an opinion finding Touch not credible and denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under CAT. Touch and Chat appealed. On January 31, 2008, the BIA reversed the IJ's credibility determination, but affirmed her order denying relief. It found that even if the applicants' testimony were credited, they had failed to prove past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. This petition for review followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>When the BIA adopts aspects of the IJ's opinion, we review those portions of the opinion in addition to the BIA decision itself. <i>Rivas-Mira v.

Asylum and Withholding of Removal</h2>\n<p>Asylum is a discretionary form of relief, available only to an individual who can prove that he is a \"refugee\" within the meaning of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"). <i>Bonilla v.

Under the INA, a \"refugee\" is a person outside his country of nationality who is \"unable or unwilling to return to . . . that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" 8 U.S.C. ยง 1101(a)(42)(A). Proof that persecution has a ten percent chance of occurring suffices to make a fear of persecution \"well-founded.\" <i>See </i><i>I.N.S. v.

That presumption may be defeated only if the government demonstrates, by a preponderance, either: (1) that there has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution, or (2) that the applicant could avoid persecution by relocating to another part of the country of nationality. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Past Persecution</h2>\n<p>Proving past persecution is a \"`daunting task.'\" <i>Butt v. Keisler,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203005\"><a href=\"/opinion/203005/butt-v-keisler/\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span>, 90 (1st Cir.2007) (quoting <i>Alibeaj v.

The mistreatment complained of must have \"reached a fairly high threshold of seriousness, as well as some regularity or frequency.\" <i>Id.</i> \"An important factor in determining whether [mistreatment amounts to persecution] is whether the mistreatment can be said to be systematic rather than reflective of a series of isolated incidents.\" <i>Bocova,</i> 412 F.3d at 263 (citing <i>In re O-Z &amp; I-Z,</i> 22 I &amp; N Dec. 23, 26 (BIA 1998)). \"[M]istreatment ordinarily must entail more than sporadic abuse in order to constitute persecution.\" <i>Id.; </i><i>Guzman v. I.N.S.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200443\"><a href=\"/opinion/200443/guzman-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">327</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 15-16 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*39</span> In this case, the BIA concluded that petitioner failed to establish that the March 1993 incident was on account of political opinion, that any presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution created by the August 1993 incident was rebutted, and that the incidents of September 1998, including the unfulfilled threat against Touch, did not amount to persecution. Petitioner challenges each one of these determinations.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. The March 1993 shooting was not on account of political opinion</h2>\n<p>Regarding the March 1993 incident, Touch testified to the IJ that he had been speaking at a political meeting, and that 7 or 8 individuals walked out of the meeting because \"they don't like our speech.\" Later, those same individuals shot at the car in which Touch was riding. Although this testimony certainly suggests that the shooters attacked Touch on account of his political opinions, we may reverse only if the BIA was <i>compelled</i> to draw that conclusion. <i>See </i><i>Tobon-Marin,</i> 512 F.3d at 31 (concluding that motive was not sufficiently proven because it remained possible to explain the attackers' conduct in another way). Here, the IJ noted that other explanations for the attack were possible. \"The attackers did not wear any uniform and did not say anything to respondent. It is at least as likely that the attackers were common thieves as government forces. The connection between respondent's campaigning . . . and the actual shooting is mere speculation.\" The evidence does not compel a contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. Any presumption resulting from the August 1993 event was rebutted by subsequent events</h2>\n<p>The BIA's conclusions about the incident in August 1993 are also supported by substantial evidence. While the grenade attack was undoubtedly serious, there was evidence refuting any presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. Touch testified that after the August 1993 attack, he retained his job at the Cambodian Ministry of the Interior. He also remained an active FUNCINPEC member. In fact, Touch testified to no incidents of mistreatment during the next five years, until 1998, when he switched political parties. A long period without mistreatment followed by disassociation with the target political organization supports the BIA's conclusion that the August 1993 attack does not give Touch reason to fear future persecution. <i>See </i><i>Pieterson v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200965\"><a href=\"/opinion/200965/pieterson-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">364</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span>, 41, 45 (1st Cir.2004) (affirming the BIA where the applicant could point to no acts of persecution against her during a five-year period in which she was uninvolved in politics).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>c. The events of September 7, 8, and 9 do not amount to persecution</h2>\n<p>The BIA's conclusion that Touch's mistreatment during the protests of September 7, 8 and 9 did not rise to the level of persecution was supported by substantial evidence. As the IJ pointed out, the government's mistreatment of Touch was largely a \"spasmodic\" response to his participation in the protests. <i>See </i><i>Guzman,</i> 327 F.3d at 15. Moreover, although the government unquestionably mistreated Touch during the protests ย beating him and forcing him to drink wastewater ย Touch did not suffer serious or permanent injuries. <i>Alibeaj v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202521\"><a href=\"/opinion/202521/alibeaj-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">188</span></a></span>, 192 (1st Cir.2006) (\"[A]lthough the police beat Alibeaj during a pro-democracy demonstration in 1990, . . . Alibeaj never testified to any permanent or serious injuries.\"). On this record, the BIA was not compelled to conclude that the government's conduct during the September demonstrations amounted to persecution.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*40</span> The most serious of the events of September 1998 was the threat against Touch's life on September 9. Unfulfilled threats rarely prove past persecution, being construed more naturally as evidence of a well-founded fear of future persecution. <i>Lim v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770192\"><a href=\"/opinion/770192/melencio-legui-lim-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">224</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">929</span></a></span>, 936 (9th Cir.2000). Such threats are evidence of past persecution \"[i]n certain extreme cases, . . . particularly where those threats are combined with confrontation or other mistreatment.\" <i>Id.</i> The unfulfilled threat must be \"`so menacing as to cause significant actual suffering or harm.'\" <i>Butt,</i> 506 F.3d at 91 (quoting <i>Lim,</i> 224 F.3d at 936); <i>see also </i><i>Tamara-Gomez v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"42677\"><a href=\"/opinion/42677/tamara-gomez-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">343</span></a></span>, 346-47, 349 (5th Cir.2006) (finding past persecution where the FARC regularly threatened the applicant with death, told his wife they would kill him and kidnap their sons, bombed his neighborhood, broke into and vandalized his home, and tracked and murdered several of his associates); <i>Li v. Atty. Gen. of the U.S.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789457\"><a href=\"/opinion/789457/zhen-hua-li-v-attorney-general-of-the-united-states-immigration/\"><span class=\"volume\">400</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">157</span></a></span>, 164-65 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>While there is no doubt that the threat to Touch was serious, the BIA was not compelled to conclude that it rose to the level of persecution. Although Chat was understandably scared, she was not harmed during the encounter with the police officers. The officers never returned to their home, and never threatened Touch or his family again. When Touch returned to Phnom Penh after three months in hiding, he again became politically active, collecting food and money for the Sam Rainsy party and attending meetings at party headquarters. The BIA thus had substantial evidence to conclude that the threat was not extreme enough to rise to the level of persecution. <i>See </i><i>Lim,</i> 224 F.3d at 936 (concluding that a threat did not rise to the level of persecution where \"Lim carried on for six years without harm and without fleeing\").</p>\n<p>Notably, the BIA appears to have viewed the record in this case as showing a number of serious isolated incidents, rather than systematic political persecution. More than five years separated the events of August 1993 from those of September 1998. As the BIA pointed out, Touch worked in the government and continued to be politically active during this time. After the events of September 1998, Touch remained in Cambodia without incident for two more years. It has now been eight years since Touch left Cambodia, and his family there has not been mistreated in that time. He is no longer politically active. Considered as a whole, this record does not compel the conclusion that Touch has been subject to a \"pattern of targeted political harassment.\" <i>Topalli,</i> 417 F.3d at 132.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, we find that the BIA's determination that Touch did not suffer past persecution is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Future Persecution</h2>\n<p>To prove a \"well-founded fear of future persecution,\" an applicant must show that his fear of persecution is both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable. <i>See </i><i>Bocova,</i> 412 F.3d at 262. In this case, the BIA noted that Touch and Chat \"continued to live without incident for a prolonged period following the September 1998 police threat,\" that Touch \"had no problems in leaving his homeland\" or obtaining a visa, and that Touch currently has no interest in Cambodian politics. Moreover, \"[t]here has been no showing that anyone, including the police or any Cambodian official, is currently interested in either [Touch or Chat] for any reason, much less based on their political views or the political activities last engaged in by [Touch] over 7 years ago.\" The BIA held that this record does not establish <span class=\"star-pagination\">*41</span> a well founded fear of being persecuted upon returning to Cambodia. The evidence does not compel a contrary result.</p>\n<p>We need not independently reach the question of withholding of removal. The standard of proof required for asylum (\"well-founded fear of persecution\") is less stringent than that required for withholding of removal (\"more likely than not to face persecution\"). <i>See </i><i>Salazar v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200879\"><a href=\"/opinion/200879/ins-v-salazar/\"><span class=\"volume\">359</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 52 (1st Cir.2004). It follows that if an applicant is unable to prove eligibility for asylum, the applicant will be unable to prove eligibility for withholding of removal. <i>Bocova,</i> 412 F.3d at 262.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Convention Against Torture</h2>\n<p>Touch also asks us to reverse the determination that he did not qualify for relief under CAT. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. ยง 1231; 8 C.F.R. ยง 1208.16(c). However, Touch fails to develop any argument to this end in his brief. For this reason, we deem the argument waived. <i>See </i><i>Negeya v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201729\"><a href=\"/opinion/201729/negeya-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span>, 85 (1st Cir.2005); <i>United States v.
