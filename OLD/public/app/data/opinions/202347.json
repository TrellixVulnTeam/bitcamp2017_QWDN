Petitioner Bertha Toloza-\n\nJiménez (\"Toloza\") asks us to review the Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals' (\"BIA\") denial of her application for asylum, withholding\n\nof   removal,   and   relief     under    the       Convention   Against   Torture\n\n(\"CAT\").    After careful review, we affirm the decision of the BIA\n\nand deny the petition for review.\n\n                                 I.   Background\n\n            Toloza is a native and citizen of Colombia who entered\n\nthe United States at Miami, Florida on July 6, 2002 as a non-\n\nimmigrant with authorization to remain in the United States until\n\nJanuary 5, 2003.      Her husband and son, both natives and citizens of\n\nColombia, had previously been admitted into the United States on\n\ntourist visas.     All three overstayed.\n\n            On January 9, 2003, Toloza filed an application for\n\nasylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention\n\nAgainst Torture (\"CAT\"). In her application for asylum, Toloza\n\nalleged that in 1975, she lived with her husband and daughter in\n\nthe Aranjuez ward in Medellín, Colombia.1                   According to Toloza,\n\nsome members of the Escobar crime family sexually harassed her\n\ndaughter, threatened to kill Toloza if she reported them to the\n\npolice, and forced her to hide weapons for them.                 In 1979, Toloza\n\npurchased   a   farm.      She    stated       in    her   application   that   the\n\n\n\n1\n   Toloza's daughter is currently living in the United States and\nwas not included in the application for asylum.\n\n                                         -2-\n\fRevolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (\"FARC\"), a guerilla group,\n\ntook possession of the farm in 1985 to use as a military base. In\n\n1986, Toloza and her family moved to the San Cristóbal ward in\n\nMedellín because of threats from the Escobar crime family.2     At\n\nthis new location, Toloza's husband, who owned a repair shop, was\n\nallegedly forced to contribute money to the FARC. In one instance,\n\nToloza claimed that the FARC stopped her and her husband at a\n\ncheckpoint and forced them to transport FARC members in their\n\ntruck.   In 1989, Toloza purchased another farm where she allegedly\n\noffered assistance to victims of the civil war.\n\n           The asylum officer found that the alleged harm did not\n\nrise to the level of persecution on the basis of any of the\n\nstatutory grounds3 and that Toloza had failed to establish a well-\n\nfounded fear of future persecution.    The asylum officer referred\n\nthe matter to an Immigration Judge (\"IJ\").\n\n           On January 28, 2003, the Immigration and Naturalization\n\nService (\"INS\")4 served Notices to Appear charging that Toloza, her\n\n\n2\n  Toloza does not allege any connections between the Escobar crime\nfamily and the FARC guerillas.\n3\n    The five protected characteristics are \"race, religion,\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, [and]\npolitical opinion.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(i).\n4\n   In March 2003, all of the relevant functions of the INS were\ntransferred to the new Department of Homeland Security, where they\nwere reorganized as the Bureau of Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement (\"BICE\"). See Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L.\nNo. 107-296, § 471, 116 Stat. 2135, 2205 (codified as amended at 6\nU.S.C. § 291(a)). Throughout the opinion we will refer to the\n\n                                -3-\n\fhusband, and her son were subject to removal for overstaying their\n\nvisas pursuant to section 237(a)(1)(B) of the Immigration and\n\nNationality Act (\"INA\"),   8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B).\n\n          On March 9, 2003, a hearing was held before an IJ.          At\n\nthe hearing, Toloza, her husband, and her son admitted the factual\n\nallegations in the Notice to Appear, conceded removability, and\n\nasked for asylum, withholding of removal, relief under the CAT, and\n\nvoluntary departure in the alternative.      Toloza then testified in\n\nsupport of her application.5\n\n          She testified that she had visited the United States on\n\ntwo previous occasions, in 1996 and 2001, before requesting asylum.\n\nToloza stated that the FARC threatened and persecuted her and her\n\nfamily because she was a member of the Liberal Party.                She\n\ntestified that the FARC threatened her in March 2002 (\"the March\n\n2002 incident\"),6 that the FARC regularly extorted money from her\n\nhusband, and that she was stopped at a FARC checkpoint and forced\n\nto transport guerilla troops in 1999.\n\n          On   cross-examination,   Toloza   admitted   that   she   had\n\nomitted the March 2002 incident from her application for asylum.\n\nWhen asked to explain this omission, Toloza first intimated that\n\n\nagency as the INS.\n5\n   Toloza was the only applicant who testified at the hearing.\nTherefore, she is considered the lead petitioner.\n6\n  Toloza initially could remember neither the month when the event\noccurred, nor how many FARC members threatened her.\n\n                                -4-\n\fshe had forgotten about the incident, then stated that she had\n\nremembered the incident but did not include it in the application.\n\nToloza also stated that the only incident that she mentioned at the\n\ninterview    at the asylum office was the 1999 checkpoint incident.7\n\nMaría Mahia (\"Mahia\")8, a friend of Toloza's from Colombia, also\n\ntestified for her.          Mahia stated that Toloza had told her of the\n\nproblems with the guerillas. However, Mahia did not witness any of\n\nthe harms alleged by Toloza.\n\n            The    IJ    found     that    Toloza's       testimony   was   \"general,\n\nmeager, weak, and superficial.\"              More specifically, the IJ found\n\nthat the testimony about the March 2002 incident was not credible.\n\nThe   IJ   based   his    finding     on    the    fact     that   Toloza   initially\n\nremembered neither the month when the event happened nor how many\n\nFARC members threatened her, and that she did not include the March\n\n2002 incident in her asylum application or mention it in her\n\ninterview with the asylum officer.                In the light of the fact that\n\nthe March 2002 incident purportedly \"precipitated the [Toloza's]\n\nflight to the United States,\" the IJ noted that Toloza's meager\n\ntestimony was \"disingenuous at best.\"                 Further, the IJ found that\n\nthe 1985 incident had no connection to her present situation\n\nbecause    she    visited    the    United       States    twice   after    the   event\n\n\n\n7\n   The asylum officer's Assessment to Refer does not mention the\nMarch 2002 incident.\n8\n    Mahia has political refugee status in the United States.\n\n                                           -5-\n\foccurred     and    each   time   she   returned    to   her   country,   thus\n\ndemonstrating that she did not fear persecution.                 The IJ also\n\nconcluded that the alleged harm experienced by Toloza was caused by\n\n\"pervasive criminality\" in her country and not by persecution on\n\naccount of \"race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular\n\nsocial group, or political opinion.\"               Therefore the IJ denied\n\nToloza's claims for asylum, withholding for removal, and relief\n\nunder CAT.    The IJ also concluded that Toloza was not eligible for\n\nvoluntary departure, but that her husband and her son were.\n\n             Toloza appealed the IJ's decision to the BIA. On July 8,\n\n2005, the BIA rendered a decision affirming the order of the IJ.\n\nToloza now petitions for review of this decision.9\n\n                                  II.   Analysis\n\n             A.    Standard of Review\n\n             In reviewing BIA decisions, we give substantial deference\n\nto its findings of fact, which include credibility determinations.\n\nNikijuluw v. Gonzáles, 427 F.3d 115, 120 (1st Cir. 2005); Bocova v.\n\nGonzáles, 412 F.3d 257, 262 (1st Cir. 2005); Da Silva v. Ashcroft,\n\n394 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2005).          We will uphold the BIA's findings\n\nof fact if they are \"supported by reasonable, substantial, and\n\nprobative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\" INS v.\n\n\n9\n   Toloza did not make any argument about CAT relief in her brief.\nBecause an argument not raised in an appellate brief is deemed\nwaived, see Mediouni v. INS, 314 F.3d 24, 28 n.5 (1st Cir. 2002),\nwe find that Toloza has waived any argument for relief under the\nCAT.\n\n                                        -6-\n\fElías-Zacarías, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992) (citation and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). The BIA decision can be reversed only if\n\nthe evidence presented by the asylum seeker is such as would compel\n\na reasonable trier of fact to make a contrary determination.          Id.;\n\nsee also   Aguilar-Solís v. INS, 168 F.3d 565, 569 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\nNonetheless, \"credibility findings resting on analysis of testimony\n\nrather than on demeanor may deserve less than usual deference.\"\n\nCordero-Trejo v. INS, 40 F.3d 482, 487 (1st Cir. 1994) (citation\n\nand internal quotation marks omitted).         The BIA's rulings of law\n\nare reviewed under a de novo standard.        Da Silva, 394 F.3d at 5.\n\n           B.   Asylum\n\n           Under the INA, the Attorney General or the Secretary of\n\nHomeland Security may grant asylum to a \"refugee.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1158\n\n(b)(1)(A).      The asylum applicant has the burden of proof to\n\nestablish that she is a \"refugee.\"         Id. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(i).      Her\n\ntestimony must be credible, persuasive, and refer to specific\n\nfacts.   Id. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(ii).       A \"refugee\" refers to any person\n\nwho is unable or unwilling to return to her country of residence\n\n\"because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on\n\naccount of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular\n\nsocial group, or political opinion.\"          Id. § 1101(a)(42)(A).      By\n\nestablishing     past    persecution,    an   applicant   establishes     a\n\nrebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution.             8\n\nC.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1).      We have previously held that \"persecution\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\frequires that the totality of a petitioner's experiences add up to\n\nmore than mere discomfiture, unpleasantness, harassment, or unfair\n\ntreatment.\"        Nikijuluw, 427 F.3d at 120.             We analyze the adverse\n\ncredibility determination, together with Toloza's claims of past\n\npersecution and a well-founded fear of persecution.\n\n                      1.     Credibility\n\n             In her brief, Toloza does not challenge the adverse\n\ncredibility determination.             She has therefore waived any argument\n\non this issue.       See Mediouni v. INS, 314 F.3d 24, 28 n.5 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).\n\n                      2.     Past Persecution\n\n             The     adverse     credibility        determination      disposes     of\n\nToloza's claim of past persecution.                See Olujoke v. Gonzáles, 411\n\nF.3d   16,   22     (1st     Cir.     2005)    (\"[A]   fully      supported    adverse\n\ncredibility determination, without more, can sustain a denial of\n\nasylum.\"); cf. 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B).                  Even assuming Toloza was\n\ncredible, she failed to establish past persecution for two reasons.\n\n             First,     persecution           is   more    than    \"unpleasantness,\n\nharassment, and even basic suffering.\"                    Nelson v. INS, 232 F.3d\n\n258, 263 (1st Cir. 2000).             Even assuming that Toloza was credible,\n\nnone of the incidents described by Toloza rises to the level of\n\npersecution. See id. at 264 (finding no persecution where the\n\nasylum   applicant         testified     about     three    episodes    of    solitary\n\nconfinement    of     less     than    72     hours,   physical     abuse,    periodic\n\n\n                                            -8-\n\fsurveillance, threatening phone calls, and occasional stops and\n\nsearches).\n\n           Second, persecution must be motivated by one of five\n\nstatutory grounds: \"race, religion, nationality, membership in a\n\nparticular social group, or political opinion.\"         8 U.S.C. § 1158\n\n(b)(1)(B)(i).   Although Toloza alleges that she is a member of the\n\nLiberal Party, encouraged her fellow citizens to vote for the\n\n\"democratic parties,\" and provided assistance to orphans and drug\n\naddicts, she fails to establish any connection between these\n\nactivities and the alleged persecution. Therefore, the record does\n\nnot compel us to overturn the IJ's finding that the harm allegedly\n\nexperienced by Toloza was not politically motivated.\n\n           Because she failed to show that her experiences rise to\n\nthe level of persecution, and because she could not provide a\n\ncausal   connection    between   these   experiences   and   any   of   the\n\nstatutory grounds for persecution, we find that Toloza, even if\n\ncredible, cannot establish past persecution.\n\n                  3.    Future Persecution\n\n           An alien can show her eligibility for asylum not only by\n\ndemonstrating past persecution but also by demonstrating a \"well-\n\nfounded fear of persecution.\"     Id. § 1101(a)(42)(A).      The test for\n\na well-founded fear of persecution has both a subjective component\n\nand an objective one.      Nikijuluw, 427 F.3d at 121.       In order to\n\nshow a well-founded fear of persecution, \"an applicant must not\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fonly harbor a genuine fear of future persecution, but also must\n\nestablish an objectively reasonable basis for that fear.\"            Laurent\n\nv. Ashcroft, 359 F.3d 59, 65 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n            Toloza failed to satisfy the subjective component because\n\nshe could not show that she has a genuine fear of persecution.\n\nFirst,    she   was   found   not    credible   regarding   the   March   2002\n\nincident. Second, she traveled twice to the United States, in 1996\n\nand 2001, and yet she returned to Colombia each time, strongly\n\nindicating that she has no fear of persecution.             In the light of\n\nthis consideration, we affirm the BIA's finding that Toloza did not\n\nestablish a well-founded fear of persecution.\n\n            Because she could show neither past persecution, nor a\n\nwell-founded fear of persecution, Toloza is not eligible for\n\nasylum.10\n\n                              III.    Conclusion\n\n            For the reasons stated above, the petition for review is\n\ndenied.\n\n            DENIED.\n\n\n\n10\n   Having failed to establish eligibility for asylum, Toloza cannot\nmeet the standard for withholding of removal. In order to be\neligible for withholding of removal to a country, the applicant\nmust \"establish that it is more likely than not that he or she\nwould be persecuted on account of race, religion, nationality,\nmembership in a particular social group, or political opinion upon\nremoval to that country.\" 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(2). This standard\nis more stringent than the standard for asylum.       See Afful v.\nAshcroft, 380 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2004). Therefore, we find that\nToloza failed to establish eligibility for withholding of removal.\n\n                                      -10-\n\f",

Petitioner Bertha Toloza-\n\nJiménez (\"Toloza\") asks us to review the Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals' (\"BIA\") denial of her application for asylum, withholding\n\nof   removal,   and   relief     under    the       Convention   Against   Torture\n\n(\"CAT\").    After careful review, we affirm the decision of the BIA\n\nand deny the petition for review.\n\n                                 I.   Background\n\n            Toloza is a native and citizen of Colombia who entered\n\nthe United States at Miami, Florida on July 6, 2002 as a non-\n\nimmigrant with authorization to remain in the United States until\n\nJanuary 5, 2003.      Her husband and son, both natives and citizens of\n\nColombia, had previously been admitted into the United States on\n\ntourist visas.     All three overstayed.\n\n            On January 9, 2003, Toloza filed an application for\n\nasylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention\n\nAgainst Torture (\"CAT\"). In her application for asylum, Toloza\n\nalleged that in 1975, she lived with her husband and daughter in\n\nthe Aranjuez ward in Medellín, Colombia.1                   According to Toloza,\n\nsome members of the Escobar crime family sexually harassed her\n\ndaughter, threatened to kill Toloza if she reported them to the\n\npolice, and forced her to hide weapons for them.                 In 1979, Toloza\n\npurchased   a   farm.      She    stated       in    her   application   that   the\n\n\n\n1\n   Toloza's daughter is currently living in the United States and\nwas not included in the application for asylum.\n\n                                         -2-\n\fRevolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (\"FARC\"), a guerilla group,\n\ntook possession of the farm in 1985 to use as a military base. In\n\n1986, Toloza and her family moved to the San Cristóbal ward in\n\nMedellín because of threats from the Escobar crime family.2     At\n\nthis new location, Toloza's husband, who owned a repair shop, was\n\nallegedly forced to contribute money to the FARC. In one instance,\n\nToloza claimed that the FARC stopped her and her husband at a\n\ncheckpoint and forced them to transport FARC members in their\n\ntruck.   In 1989, Toloza purchased another farm where she allegedly\n\noffered assistance to victims of the civil war.\n\n           The asylum officer found that the alleged harm did not\n\nrise to the level of persecution on the basis of any of the\n\nstatutory grounds3 and that Toloza had failed to establish a well-\n\nfounded fear of future persecution.    The asylum officer referred\n\nthe matter to an Immigration Judge (\"IJ\").\n\n           On January 28, 2003, the Immigration and Naturalization\n\nService (\"INS\")4 served Notices to Appear charging that Toloza, her\n\n\n2\n  Toloza does not allege any connections between the Escobar crime\nfamily and the FARC guerillas.\n3\n    The five protected characteristics are \"race, religion,\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, [and]\npolitical opinion.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(i).\n4\n   In March 2003, all of the relevant functions of the INS were\ntransferred to the new Department of Homeland Security, where they\nwere reorganized as the Bureau of Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement (\"BICE\"). See Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L.\nNo. 107-296, § 471, 116 Stat. 2135, 2205 (codified as amended at 6\nU.S.C. § 291(a)). Throughout the opinion we will refer to the\n\n                                -3-\n\fhusband, and her son were subject to removal for overstaying their\n\nvisas pursuant to section 237(a)(1)(B) of the Immigration and\n\nNationality Act (\"INA\"),   8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B).\n\n          On March 9, 2003, a hearing was held before an IJ.          At\n\nthe hearing, Toloza, her husband, and her son admitted the factual\n\nallegations in the Notice to Appear, conceded removability, and\n\nasked for asylum, withholding of removal, relief under the CAT, and\n\nvoluntary departure in the alternative.      Toloza then testified in\n\nsupport of her application.5\n\n          She testified that she had visited the United States on\n\ntwo previous occasions, in 1996 and 2001, before requesting asylum.\n\nToloza stated that the FARC threatened and persecuted her and her\n\nfamily because she was a member of the Liberal Party.                She\n\ntestified that the FARC threatened her in March 2002 (\"the March\n\n2002 incident\"),6 that the FARC regularly extorted money from her\n\nhusband, and that she was stopped at a FARC checkpoint and forced\n\nto transport guerilla troops in 1999.\n\n          On   cross-examination,   Toloza   admitted   that   she   had\n\nomitted the March 2002 incident from her application for asylum.\n\nWhen asked to explain this omission, Toloza first intimated that\n\n\nagency as the INS.\n5\n   Toloza was the only applicant who testified at the hearing.\nTherefore, she is considered the lead petitioner.\n6\n  Toloza initially could remember neither the month when the event\noccurred, nor how many FARC members threatened her.\n\n                                -4-\n\fshe had forgotten about the incident, then stated that she had\n\nremembered the incident but did not include it in the application.\n\nToloza also stated that the only incident that she mentioned at the\n\ninterview    at the asylum office was the 1999 checkpoint incident.7\n\nMaría Mahia (\"Mahia\")8, a friend of Toloza's from Colombia, also\n\ntestified for her.          Mahia stated that Toloza had told her of the\n\nproblems with the guerillas. However, Mahia did not witness any of\n\nthe harms alleged by Toloza.\n\n            The    IJ    found     that    Toloza's       testimony   was   \"general,\n\nmeager, weak, and superficial.\"              More specifically, the IJ found\n\nthat the testimony about the March 2002 incident was not credible.\n\nThe   IJ   based   his    finding     on    the    fact     that   Toloza   initially\n\nremembered neither the month when the event happened nor how many\n\nFARC members threatened her, and that she did not include the March\n\n2002 incident in her asylum application or mention it in her\n\ninterview with the asylum officer.                In the light of the fact that\n\nthe March 2002 incident purportedly \"precipitated the [Toloza's]\n\nflight to the United States,\" the IJ noted that Toloza's meager\n\ntestimony was \"disingenuous at best.\"                 Further, the IJ found that\n\nthe 1985 incident had no connection to her present situation\n\nbecause    she    visited    the    United       States    twice   after    the   event\n\n\n\n7\n   The asylum officer's Assessment to Refer does not mention the\nMarch 2002 incident.\n8\n    Mahia has political refugee status in the United States.\n\n                                           -5-\n\foccurred     and    each   time   she   returned    to   her   country,   thus\n\ndemonstrating that she did not fear persecution.                 The IJ also\n\nconcluded that the alleged harm experienced by Toloza was caused by\n\n\"pervasive criminality\" in her country and not by persecution on\n\naccount of \"race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular\n\nsocial group, or political opinion.\"               Therefore the IJ denied\n\nToloza's claims for asylum, withholding for removal, and relief\n\nunder CAT.    The IJ also concluded that Toloza was not eligible for\n\nvoluntary departure, but that her husband and her son were.\n\n             Toloza appealed the IJ's decision to the BIA. On July 8,\n\n2005, the BIA rendered a decision affirming the order of the IJ.\n\nToloza now petitions for review of this decision.9\n\n                                  II.

The BIA's rulings of law\n\nare reviewed under a de novo standard.        Da Silva, 394 F.3d at 5.\n\n           B.   Asylum\n\n           Under the INA, the Attorney General or the Secretary of\n\nHomeland Security may grant asylum to a \"refugee.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1158\n\n(b)(1)(A).      The asylum applicant has the burden of proof to\n\nestablish that she is a \"refugee.\"         Id. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(i).      Her\n\ntestimony must be credible, persuasive, and refer to specific\n\nfacts.   Id. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(ii).       A \"refugee\" refers to any person\n\nwho is unable or unwilling to return to her country of residence\n\n\"because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on\n\naccount of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular\n\nsocial group, or political opinion.\"          Id. § 1101(a)(42)(A).      By\n\nestablishing     past    persecution,    an   applicant   establishes     a\n\nrebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution.             8\n\nC.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1).      We have previously held that \"persecution\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\frequires that the totality of a petitioner's experiences add up to\n\nmore than mere discomfiture, unpleasantness, harassment, or unfair\n\ntreatment.\"        Nikijuluw, 427 F.3d at 120.             We analyze the adverse\n\ncredibility determination, together with Toloza's claims of past\n\npersecution and a well-founded fear of persecution.\n\n                      1.     Credibility\n\n             In her brief, Toloza does not challenge the adverse\n\ncredibility determination.             She has therefore waived any argument\n\non this issue.       See Mediouni v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200253\"><a href=\"/opinion/200253/mediouni-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">314</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 28 n.5 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).\n\n                      2.     Past Persecution\n\n             The     adverse     credibility        determination      disposes     of\n\nToloza's claim of past persecution.                See Olujoke v. Gonzáles, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>   <span class=\"page\">16</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,   22     (1st     Cir.     2005)    (\"[A]   fully      supported    adverse\n\ncredibility determination, without more, can sustain a denial of\n\nasylum.\"); cf. 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B).                  Even assuming Toloza was\n\ncredible, she failed to establish past persecution for two reasons.\n\n             First,     persecution           is   more    than    \"unpleasantness,\n\nharassment, and even basic suffering.\"                    Nelson v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771091\"><a href=\"/opinion/771091/laeila-nelson-stephanie-nelson-phil-nelson-v-immigration-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">258</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 263 (1st Cir. 2000).             Even assuming that Toloza was credible,\n\nnone of the incidents described by Toloza rises to the level of\n\npersecution. See id. at 264 (finding no persecution where the\n\nasylum   applicant         testified     about     three    episodes    of    solitary\n\nconfinement    of     less     than    72     hours,   physical     abuse,    periodic\n\n\n                                            -8-\n\fsurveillance, threatening phone calls, and occasional stops and\n\nsearches).\n\n           Second, persecution must be motivated by one of five\n\nstatutory grounds: \"race, religion, nationality, membership in a\n\nparticular social group, or political opinion.\"         8 U.S.C. § 1158\n\n(b)(1)(B)(i).   Although Toloza alleges that she is a member of the\n\nLiberal Party, encouraged her fellow citizens to vote for the\n\n\"democratic parties,\" and provided assistance to orphans and drug\n\naddicts, she fails to establish any connection between these\n\nactivities and the alleged persecution. Therefore, the record does\n\nnot compel us to overturn the IJ's finding that the harm allegedly\n\nexperienced by Toloza was not politically motivated.\n\n           Because she failed to show that her experiences rise to\n\nthe level of persecution, and because she could not provide a\n\ncausal   connection    between   these   experiences   and   any   of   the\n\nstatutory grounds for persecution, we find that Toloza, even if\n\ncredible, cannot establish past persecution.\n\n                  3.    Future Persecution\n\n           An alien can show her eligibility for asylum not only by\n\ndemonstrating past persecution but also by demonstrating a \"well-\n\nfounded fear of persecution.\"     Id. § 1101(a)(42)(A).      The test for\n\na well-founded fear of persecution has both a subjective component\n\nand an objective one.      Nikijuluw, 427 F.3d at 121.       In order to\n\nshow a well-founded fear of persecution, \"an applicant must not\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fonly harbor a genuine fear of future persecution, but also must\n\nestablish an objectively reasonable basis for that fear.\"            Laurent\n\nv. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200882\"><a href=\"/opinion/200882/laurent-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">359</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 65 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n            Toloza failed to satisfy the subjective component because\n\nshe could not show that she has a genuine fear of persecution.\n\nFirst,    she   was   found   not    credible   regarding   the   March   2002\n\nincident. Second, she traveled twice to the United States, in 1996\n\nand 2001, and yet she returned to Colombia each time, strongly\n\nindicating that she has no fear of persecution.             In the light of\n\nthis consideration, we affirm the BIA's finding that Toloza did not\n\nestablish a well-founded fear of persecution.\n\n            Because she could show neither past persecution, nor a\n\nwell-founded fear of persecution, Toloza is not eligible for\n\nasylum.10\n\n                              III.    Conclusion\n\n            For the reasons stated above, the petition for review is\n\ndenied.\n\n            DENIED.\n\n\n\n10\n   Having failed to establish eligibility for asylum, Toloza cannot\nmeet the standard for withholding of removal. In order to be\neligible for withholding of removal to a country, the applicant\nmust \"establish that it is more likely than not that he or she\nwould be persecuted on account of race, religion, nationality,\nmembership in a particular social group, or political opinion upon\nremoval to that country.\" 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(2). This standard\nis more stringent than the standard for asylum.       See Afful v.\nAshcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201174\"><a href=\"/opinion/201174/afful-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">380</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 6 (1st Cir. 2004). Therefore, we find that\nToloza failed to establish eligibility for withholding of removal.\n\n                                      -10-\n\f</pre>",
