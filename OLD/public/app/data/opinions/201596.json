Reginald C. Lindsay, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                         Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n                   Baldock, Senior Circuit Judge,*\n                        Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Patrick M. Hamilton, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief,\nfor appellee.\n     Karen A. Pickett, with whom Donnelly, Conroy & Gelhaar, LLP\nwas on brief, for appellant.\n\n\n\n                            May 23, 2005\n\n\n\n\n    *\n        Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f            LYNCH, Circuit Judge. On appeal from his guilty plea and\n\nsentence, Alonso Tavarez raises two arguments: (1) that his guilty\n\nplea violated Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure as\n\nit was not knowing and intelligent and (2) that his sentence should\n\nbe vacated and remanded for resentencing in light of United States\n\nv. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005), when he did not preserve a claim\n\nof error below.        We reject both arguments and affirm Tavarez'\n\nconviction and sentence.\n\n            On   September    20,    2000,    a     grand    jury   returned      an\n\nindictment against Tavarez.         Count One charged him with conspiracy\n\nto possess with intent to distribute and to distribute at least\n\nfive kilograms of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846.                  Count\n\nNineteen charged him with possession with intent to distribute and\n\ndistribution of at least five kilograms of cocaine in violation of\n\n21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and 841 (b)(1)(A)(ii)(II).                   Tavarez pled\n\nguilty to both of these counts on October 30, 2002.                  On March 17,\n\n2003, the district court sentenced the defendant to 70 months'\n\nimprisonment     followed    by   three     years    of     supervised    release.\n\nAlthough the crime to which the defendant pled guilty carries a\n\nmandatory    minimum    sentence     of     ten   years,     see    21   U.S.C.    §\n\n841(b)(1)(A), the defendant's sentence was significantly reduced\n\ndue to the application of the safety valve, 28 U.S.C. § 3553(f),\n\nand the defendant's acceptance of responsibility.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f            We reject Tavarez' first argument that his guilty plea\n\nwas taken in violation of Fed. R. Crim. P. 11 because it was not\n\n\"knowing and intelligent\" as it was based on an understanding of a\n\nsentencing scheme rendered erroneous by United States v. Booker,\n\n125 S. Ct. 738 (2005).         The defendant conceded at oral argument\n\nthat this court's opinion in United States v. Sahlin, 399 F.3d 27\n\n(1st Cir. 2005), resolves this issue against the defendant.                      See\n\nSahlin, 399 F.3d at 31.\n\n            We also reject Tavarez' second argument that his case\n\nshould be remanded for resentencing because the district court\n\nsentenced him under the mandatory Guidelines regime.                       As the\n\ndefendant did not preserve this error below, his claim is reviewed\n\nfor plain error.      See United States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68\n\n(1st Cir. 2005). Tavarez must show a \"reasonable probability\" that\n\nthe district court would have imposed a lower sentence if the\n\nGuidelines     were   advisory.     Id.       at   75;   see   United   States    v.\n\nHeldeman, 402 F.3d 220, 224 (1st Cir. 2005).                   While we are not\n\n\"overly demanding as to proof of probability,\" in this case, the\n\ndefendant    has   offered    us   no   \"reasonable        indication   that     the\n\ndistrict judge might well have reached a different result under\n\nadvisory guidelines.\"        Heldeman, 402 F.3d at 224.           The factors to\n\nwhich Tavarez points -- for example, his status as a deportable\n\nfelon,   his    psychiatric    history,        and   his   recognition    of     the\n\nconsequences of his crime on family members -- do not convince us\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fthat the district court would have imposed a sentence below the\n\nsentence he has already received.\n\n          Accordingly, his conviction and sentence are affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -4-\n\f",
