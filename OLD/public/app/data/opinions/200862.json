R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                       For the First Circuit\n\nNo. 03-1195\n\n                           STAN SCHOLINDER,\n\n                        Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                                     v.\n\n                    FIRST NATIONAL DEFENDANTS,\n\n                            Defendants.\n                        ____________________\n\n                      CAPITAL ONE DEFENDANTS,\n\n                       Defendants, Appellees.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n         [Hon. Douglas P. Woodlock, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                     Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n              Cyr and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Stan Schuldiner on brief pro se.\n     Darrell Mook, Andrew P. Botti, John E. Matosky, and Donovan\nHatem LLP, on brief for appellees Capital One Defendants.\n\n\n\n                          February 19, 2004\n\f            Per Curiam.    Pro se plaintiff-appellant Stan Schuldiner\n\n(\"Schuldiner\"),1 an attorney, appeals from the grant of summary\n\njudgment in favor of defendants-appellees Capital One Services,\n\nInc., Capital One Financial Corporation, Capital One Bank, Capital\n\nOne FSB, Capital One, and People First, Inc. (the \"Capital One\n\nDefendants\").     We review summary judgment decisions de novo,\n\nexamining   the   record    independently        and   drawing    any    factual\n\ninferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\n\nRosenberg v. City of Everett, 328 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\nAfter carefully reviewing the parties' briefs and the record on\n\nappeal, we affirm the lower court's judgment.            We briefly address\n\nSchuldiner's claims of error.\n\n            Schuldiner    argues   that    the   district     court     erred   in\n\ngranting    summary   judgment     for    the    defendants      without   first\n\naddressing whether the court had personal jurisdiction over all of\n\nthem.    His contention is unavailing.          Having willingly chosen the\n\nforum, and not having asked the court below to pass first on the\n\njurisdictional issue, Schuldiner cannot now be allowed to escape an\n\nadverse judgment by asserting rights belonging not to him but to\n\nhis litigation adversaries.        Feinstein v. Resolution Trust Corp.,\n\n942 F.2d 34, 40 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       The record contains at least three variations of the\nplaintiff's last name, which the plaintiff explained as\ntypographical errors. We use the correct spelling.\n\n                                     -2-\n\f          Schuldiner next argues that the court erred in ruling\n\nthat Capital One Bank's credit card solicitation constituted a\n\npermissible \"firm offer of credit\" under the Fair Credit Reporting\n\nAct, 15 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq. (\"FCRA\").    A \"firm offer of credit\"\n\nis defined as \"any offer of credit . . . to a consumer that will be\n\nhonored if the consumer is determined, based on information in a\n\nconsumer report on the consumer, to meet the specific criteria used\n\nto select the consumer for the offer . . . .\"   Id. § 1681a(l).    The\n\noffer may be further conditioned on the consumer meeting additional\n\nrequirements,      including   \"specific   criteria    bearing      on\n\ncreditworthiness.\" Id. § 1681a(l)(1). The FCRA does not define or\n\nlimit the criteria that may be used in making a \"firm offer of\n\ncredit,\" as long as the criteria are established \"before selection\n\nof the consumer for the offer\" and \"for the purpose of determining\n\nwhether to extend credit . . . pursuant to the offer.\"           Id. §\n\n1681a(l)(1)(A) & (B).    Having reviewed the documents at issue, we\n\nagree with the district court that Capital One Bank's solicitation\n\nfell squarely within the definition of a \"firm offer of credit\"\n\nunder the FCRA.\n\n          Schuldiner also argues that the court erred in finding\n\nthat the conditional status of Capital One Bank's credit offer was\n\nconspicuous. The district court made no such ruling, as Schuldiner\n\ndid not make this complaint against any Capital One Defendant in\n\nthe court below.    Rather, Schuldiner raised this claim against the\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fFirst National Defendants, which the district court considered and\n\nrejected.       Schuldiner cannot assert this claim now against the\n\nCapital One Defendants.         See United States v. Bongiorno, 106 F.3d\n\n1027, 1034 (1st Cir. 1997) (noting that arguments not raised in\n\nlower court cannot be advanced on appeal).\n\n               Schuldiner further argues that the court erred in finding\n\nthat Capital One Bank's solicitation provided adequate notice under\n\n15 U.S.C. § 1681m(d)(1)(D) of his right to prevent his credit\n\ninformation from being disclosed for an offer of credit unless\n\ninitiated by him.            Specifically, Schuldiner contends that, by\n\nproviding contact information for only three out of the four\n\nnational credit reporting agencies, Capital One Bank's \"opt out\"\n\nnotice was defective.         Schuldiner adds that the defendant's use of\n\nthe phrase \"your credit report\" instead of the plural form \"your\n\ncredit reports\" compounded the error. The district court correctly\n\nfound that Capital One Bank's notice complied with the FCRA.\n\nSchuldiner provides no support for his contention that the term\n\n\"your credit report\" refers to a report from only one reporting\n\nagency.        Also, Capital One Bank's statement complies with the\n\nFederal Trade Commission's model notice provision.               See 16 C.F.R.\n\nPt. 601, App. C (Prescribed Notice of User Responsibilities),\n\nSection V (Obligations of Users of \"Prescreened\" Lists).\n\n               Schuldiner's final argument is that the court erroneously\n\ndenied    as    moot   his    motions   to    amend   his   complaint,   without\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fconsidering whether the proposed amendments would survive a motion\n\nto dismiss.      The record belies his claim.   The district court\n\nconsidered, and ultimately rejected, Schuldiner's motions to amend\n\nhis complaint.     We need not reach the issue of whether leave to\n\namend should have been given, because Schuldiner has not presented\n\nany developed argument on that point.   See Bongiorno, 106 F.3d at\n\n1034 (noting that issues raised in perfunctory manner are deemed\n\nwaived).\n\n           The judgment of the district court is affirmed.   See 1st\n\nCir. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f",
