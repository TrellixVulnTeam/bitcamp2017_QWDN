This political affiliation case\n\nfrom Puerto Rico presents a few new twists.\n\n           In Rutan v. Republican Party of Illinois, 497 U.S. 62\n\n(1990), the Supreme Court held that non-policymaking governmental\n\nemployees are protected by the First Amendment from discriminatory\n\npromotion, transfer, recall, or hiring on the basis of political\n\naffiliation.     Id. at 79.    In Branti v. Finkel, 445 U.S. 507 (1980),\n\nthe Court had held that non-policymaking public employees are\n\nprotected from firing based solely on political affiliation, and\n\nthat dismissed employees need not prove that they were coerced into\n\nchanging their political affiliation.            Id. at 516-17; see also\n\nElrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 372-73 (1976) (plurality opinion)\n\n(concluding that the First Amendment protects against patronage\n\ndismissals     unless   political      affiliation       is   an   appropriate\n\nrequirement for the position in question).\n\n           In many places, when there is a change in control of the\n\nadministration between two major political parties -- in Puerto\n\nRico, a change between the Popular Democratic Party (PDP) and the\n\nNew Progressive Party (NPP) -- overly zealous political operatives\n\nof the prevailing party terminate, demote, or reduce the salaries\n\nof   employees    affiliated    with    the   outgoing    opposition   party.\n\nSometimes these actions violate the First Amendment, see, e.g.,\n\nRodríguez-Marín v. Rivera-González, 438 F.3d 72, 75-76 (1st Cir.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\f2006), whereas other times, they do not, see, e.g., Vélez-Rivera v.\n\nAgosto-Alicea, 437 F.3d 145, 148-50 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n           This action in turn sometimes causes a reaction.       In\n\nPuerto Rico, we have noted that at times, \"the outgoing party\n\nattempts to secure the continued tenure of its members in public\n\njobs through a variety of devices, such as reclassifying policy-\n\ntype appointments as career positions or making appointments in\n\nviolation of Puerto Rico law.\"     Sanchez-Lopez v. Fuentes-Pujols,\n\n375 F.3d 121, 125 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n           The plaintiffs in this case, with one exception, are\n\nemployees of the Puerto Rico Public Service Commission (PSC).1\n\nThey bring this action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that a\n\nnewly    elected   PDP     administration   engaged   in   political\n\ndiscrimination against them and violated their rights to equal\n\nprotection and due process.    They also bring various claims under\n\nPuerto Rico law.   P.R. Const. art. II, §§ 1, 6, 7; Public Service\n\nPersonnel Act, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, §§ 1301-1431 (2003 & Supp.);\n\nid. tit. 31, § 5141.     The district court granted summary judgment\n\nto the defendants on all federal claims and declined to exercise\n\nsupplemental jurisdiction over the claims brought under Puerto Rico\n\n\n\n\n     1\n          William Fernández-Aguila brings a claim under Puerto Rico\nlaw as the husband of plaintiff Sonia Cedeño-Acosta, a PSC\nemployee.   We refer to the PSC employees as \"the plaintiffs\"\nthroughout this opinion.\n\n                                  -3-\n\flaw.       Morales Santiago v. Hernandez Perez, No. 03-1734, 2005 U.S.\n\nDist. LEXIS 34704, at *42 (D.P.R. Dec. 20, 2005).        We affirm.\n\n                                     I.\n\n               We review the district court's grant of summary judgment\n\nde novo, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the\n\nnonmoving party.       Acosta-Orozco v. Rodriguez-de-Rivera, 132 F.3d\n\n97, 98 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n               On November 7, 2000, the PDP's candidate for governor won\n\nthe general election in Puerto Rico, ushering in a change of\n\nadministration from the incumbent NPP to the PDP.           The new PDP\n\nadministration assumed power on January 2, 2001.\n\n               The plaintiffs in this case held various positions at the\n\nPSC in the former NPP administration, and all were affiliated with\n\nthe NPP.       Details as to each plaintiff and defendant may be found\n\nin the thoughtful opinion by the district court. Morales Santiago,\n\n2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34704, at *4-20.        We describe the essential\n\nfacts.\n\n               Each of the plaintiffs, save one, had the following\n\ncareer path in common.        Each was a member of the NPP and held a\n\ntrust position in the PSC under a chairman affiliated with the NPP\n\nparty. Each resigned that trust position several months before the\n\nNovember 2000 general election2 and/or before the October 2002\n\n\n       2\n          During the period in question, Puerto Rico had a ban on\nmost personnel actions, including changes in the category of\nemployees, taking place within the two months prior to and the two\n\n                                    -4-\n\fchange in party control of the PSC's chairmanship.3        Each was\n\nreinstated to his or her former career position or a similar career\n\nposition,4 to which each was entitled under Puerto Rico law.   P.R.\n\nLaws Ann. tit. 3, § 1350(8)(a) (2003 & Supp.); see also Rosario-\n\nUrdaz v. Velazco, 433 F.3d 174, 176 (1st Cir. 2006); González-de-\n\nBlasini v. Family Dep't, 377 F.3d 81, 84 n.1 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nHowever, each was rewarded by the then-NPP administration with a\n\nsalary more commensurate with the previously held trust position\n\nthan with the reinstated career position.   This was done through a\n\ndevice called \"salary by exception.\"\n\n\n\n\nmonths after a general election. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, § 1337\n(2003 & Supp.); see also Colón-Santiago v. Rosario, 438 F.3d 101,\n104 (1st Cir. 2006). A similar ban currently exists at P.R. Laws\nAnn. tit. 3, § 1462h.\n     3\n           Defendant José Hernández-Pérez became Chairman of the PSC\non October 1, 2002. His predecessor, Waldemar Quiles-Rodríguez,\nwho was affiliated with the previous administration, had previously\nsought an order from the federal district court enjoining the new\nPDP governor from removing him as Chairman before the expiration of\nhis term on September 28, 2002. Quiles Rodriguez v. Calderon, 172\nF. Supp. 2d 334, 337 (D.P.R. 2001). Although no injunction issued\nin light of the plaintiff's failure to file certified English\ntranslations of Spanish documents, the district court found that\nQuiles-Rodríguez was entitled under Puerto Rico law to hold the\nchairmanship until the expiration of his term. Id. at 348.\n     4\n           This return to career positions is common because many,\nthough not all, trust positions are policymaking positions into\nwhich a newly elected administration may place members of its party\nwithout violating the First Amendment.       See Ruiz-Casillas v.\nCamacho-Morales, 415 F.3d 127, 130-32 (1st Cir. 2005); Jimenez\nFuentes v. Torres Gaztambide, 807 F.2d 236, 241-42 (1st Cir. 1986)\n(en banc).\n\n                                -5-\n\f             In October and November 2002, within approximately one\n\nmonth of the PDP's gaining control of the PSC's chairmanship, the\n\nPDP administration reduced the salaries of each plaintiff to within\n\n(or    above)   the       range    of   his    or     her    relevant      career   job\n\nclassification.       The new administration stated that it did this to\n\ncorrect excessive salaries illegally awarded by the outgoing NPP\n\nadministration.\n\n             Specifically, under the applicable regulations for re-\n\nentry to career service, an increase in salary by exception for an\n\nemployee returning to career service from a trust position would\n\nhave been authorized only if two conditions were met: (a) the\n\nemployee had served in the same trust position for a continuous\n\nperiod of not less than five years, and (b) the employee's duties\n\nand responsibilities in the career position were equivalent to\n\nthose in the trust position. Uniform Compensation Regulation, P.R.\n\nReg.   No.   3109,    §    4.8.7   (June      7,    1984).     Even   if    those   two\n\nconditions were met, it would have been discretionary whether the\n\nsalary was raised, and any increase would have been limited by the\n\nmaximum salary in the schedule for the career service position.\n\nId.\n\n             The remaining plaintiff, Sonia Cedeño-Acosta, served as\n\nAssociate Commissioner of the PSC, a trust position, from April\n\n2000 until November 2001.           At that point in time, she returned to\n\na career position and received a salary increase by exception.\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fShortly   thereafter,   she   was   appointed   to   a   different   trust\n\nposition, where she remained until she was removed by the new PDP\n\nadministration on September 30, 2002. Cedeño-Acosta was reinstated\n\nto her previous career position at a salary that was substantially\n\nless than the salary she had been receiving in the trust position,\n\nbut that was well within the range for the career position.          All of\n\nthe PSC's actions were taken pursuant to the Uniform Compensation\n\nAct, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, §§ 760-760j (2003 & Supp.), and\n\nregulations implementing that act.\n\n           The plaintiffs filed suit, alleging primarily that the\n\nsalary reductions by the defendant PDP administrators constituted\n\npolitical discrimination.5      In addition to the First Amendment\n\nclaim, the plaintiffs asserted equal protection and procedural due\n\nprocess claims, as well as various claims under Puerto Rico law.\n\nThe general defense of the new administration was that the old NPP\n\nadministration had violated Puerto Rico law by increasing the\n\nplaintiffs' salaries by exception and that Puerto Rico law fully\n\nauthorized the corrective measures the new administration had\n\ntaken.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n           One of the plaintiffs also initially alleged that her\nemployment conditions had been substantially eroded. We understand\nthe issue on appeal to be limited to the reduction in the\nplaintiffs' salaries. See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17\n(1st Cir. 1990) (\"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,\nunaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed\nwaived.\").\n\n                                    -7-\n\f          The   district   court   granted   summary   judgment   to   the\n\ndefendants on all federal claims, dismissing them with prejudice.\n\nMorales Santiago, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34704, at *42.            On the\n\npolitical discrimination claim, the district court found that the\n\nplaintiffs had failed to establish a prima facie case, by failing\n\nto adduce sufficient evidence that political affiliation was a\n\nsubstantial or motivating factor in the salary reductions, in the\n\nface of the defendants' stated reasons that they acted to correct\n\nthe illegality of the earlier personnel actions.          Id. at *22, 35.\n\nThe district court also found that the plaintiffs' evidence had\n\nfailed to create a material issue of fact that they were entitled\n\nto their previous salaries, and that the adjusted salaries of all\n\nthe plaintiffs were, at the least, at the upper end of the salary\n\nscale for their respective career positions.              Id. at *34-35.\n\nFinally, the district court rejected the plaintiffs' reliance on\n\nvarious statements allegedly made by the defendants, finding such\n\nevidence insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact as\n\nto the defendants' motivation.     Id. at *31-32.\n\n          The district court held that the equal protection claim\n\nwas essentially duplicative of the First Amendment claim and\n\ndismissed it for the same reasons.       Id. at *36-37.    The court also\n\nheld that a post-deprivation hearing satisfied any constitutional\n\ndue process requirements, noting that the plaintiffs had not been\n\nterminated from their jobs.    Id. at *39-42.     Having dismissed the\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fplaintiffs' federal claims, and having found no independent basis\n\nfor federal jurisdiction over the Puerto Rico law claims, the\n\ndistrict court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction and\n\ndismissed the Puerto Rico law claims without prejudice.                 Id. at\n\n*42.\n\n                                     II.\n\nA.            First Amendment Political Discrimination Claims\n\n              There is an initial question of law as to whether the\n\nplaintiffs have stated a First Amendment claim at all with respect\n\nto the reduction of their higher salaries that had been previously\n\nraised by exception.      The claim does not literally fall within the\n\nscope of Rutan's extension of First Amendment protection from job\n\ndismissals to promotion, transfer, recall, or hiring decisions.\n\n497 U.S. at 79.        Further, the analysis in Rutan as to why the\n\nprotection extends to these categories of job actions does not flow\n\nreadily to the reduction of salaries enhanced by exception.                See\n\nid. at 71-79.         However, the defendants chose not to make this\n\nargument in their papers in the district court or here, although it\n\ndid come up at oral argument.         In the absence of briefing on the\n\nissue, we turn to the summary judgment argument.\n\n              In Colón-Santiago v. Rosario, 438 F.3d 101 (1st Cir.\n\n2006), this court provided a description of the relevant Puerto\n\nRico employment law.       Id. at 108-09.    We highlight the key points\n\nfor    this   case.     Public   employees   in   Puerto   Rico   are   either\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fconfidential (trust) employees or career employees. P.R. Laws Ann.\n\ntit. 3, § 1349 (2003 & Supp.).6            When a career employee moves to a\n\ntrust position, the employee has a right to reinstatement to a\n\nposition equivalent to the former career position, but may not\n\nretain     the   increased    salary   of     the   trust    position.     Id.    §\n\n1350(8)(a)7; see also Colón-Santiago, 438 F.3d at 111.\n\n             As the district court sagely observed, this has created\n\nthe following dynamic.         Morales Santiago, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS\n\n34704, at *20-21.      It has become common in Puerto Rico that as an\n\nelection approaches, the administration in power, as a political\n\nmeasure to protect its party members, returns its trust employees\n\nto their previous positions as career employees.                   They do so not\n\nat the salary then scheduled for the career position, as provided\n\nfor   by   Puerto   Rico     law,   see,    e.g.,   P.R.    Laws   Ann.   tit.   3,\n\n§ 1350(8)(a) (2003 & Supp.), but rather at a salary in excess of\n\nthat traditionally awarded for the position.                 See, e.g., Cardona\n\nMartinez v. Rodriguez Quiñones, 306 F. Supp. 2d 89, 96-97 (D.P.R.\n\n2004); see also Céspedes Rodríguez v. Rivera Hernandes, 135 F.\n\nApp'x 441, 442 (1st Cir. 2005) (per curiam).               Where a higher salary\n\nby exception is awarded in violation of Puerto Rico law, the new\n\nadministration has authority to reduce that excessive salary to the\n\n\n      6\n          A similar provision can now be found at P.R. Laws Ann.\ntit. 3, § 1465.\n      7\n          A similar provision can now be found at P.R. Laws Ann.\ntit. 3, § 1465a(1).\n\n                                       -10-\n\fscheduled salary for the career position.           See Colón-Santiago, 438\n\nF.3d at 111; Cardona Martinez, 306 F. Supp. 2d at 97-98.                     An\n\nemployee whose salary is reduced may bring an appeal before the\n\nAppeals Board of the Personnel Administration System.\n\n          We simplify the analysis to whether there was evidence to\n\ncreate a material issue of fact that political affiliation was a\n\nsubstantial     or   motivating     factor     in   the   salary    reduction.\n\nPlaintiffs     say   that   their   salaries    were   reduced     because   the\n\ndefendants knew that they were NPP members.               Defendants counter\n\nthat the salaries were reduced because the previous raises had been\n\ngiven in violation of Puerto Rico law and that these reductions\n\nwould   have     occurred     regardless       of   plaintiffs'      political\n\naffiliation.\n\n          Plaintiffs do not dispute that no disparate impact claim\n\nis recognized under Rutan, see Sanchez-Lopez, 375 F.3d at 140, but\n\nnonetheless argue that an inference of intentional discrimination\n\nis raised from the mere fact that they were all known NPP members\n\nand their salaries were reduced by the new PDP heads of the PSC.\n\nIn context, that is not a rational inference.\n\n          It is quite likely that when a new administration looks\n\nto correct violations of Puerto Rico law as to the salaries of\n\nemployees retained from the prior administration, the majority --\n\nif not all -- of the corrections will be to salaries of persons\n\nbelonging to the party of the now-deposed prior administration.\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fIndeed, such corrective action may be needed to prevent abuse of\n\nthe Rutan doctrine.       Rutan is clear that the democratic process\n\nand, correspondingly, the electorate's decision to put a different\n\npolitical party in power should not be frustrated.        497 U.S. at 70.\n\nThe payment of unwarranted, higher salaries awarded by the prior\n\nadministration    would    leave   a   new   administration   with   fewer\n\nfinancial resources available to do the will of the voters.\n\n          Here, the Puerto Rico laws and regulations that put\n\nlimits on the extent of government salaries were meant to secure\n\ncompliance with Puerto Rico's constitutional policy of equal pay\n\nfor equal work.    Colón-Santiago, 438 F.3d at 109; see also P.R.\n\nConst. art. II, § 16.       These provisions also help prevent Rutan\n\nabuses by authorizing the new administration to take corrective\n\nactions to undo preferential salary adjustments given by a former\n\nadministration to its stalwarts.\n\n          The    plaintiffs    have    offered   no   evidence   that   the\n\ndefendants' position that the salaries were reduced to correct\n\nviolations of Puerto Rico law is false.8          Perhaps in rare cases\n\n\n\n     8\n          The plaintiffs argue that § 4.11 of the Uniform\nCompensation Regulation gives discretion to the nominating\nauthority to grant higher salaries to employees when, after\nrigorous evaluation, it is determined that the merits of the\nindividual case justify it and such a salary increase would provide\na benefit to the agency. However, the plaintiffs fail to address\nthe fact that § 4.11 also provides that when there is a change of\ncategory from a trust position to a career position, the employee's\nsalary will be set in accordance with § 4.8 and its prerequisites\nfor salary by exception.\n\n                                   -12-\n\fsuch an explanation by administrators can be said clearly to be a\n\npretext. Not here. The defendants submitted evidence establishing\n\nthat the plaintiffs had failed to meet the prerequisites for any\n\naward of salary by exception.          Further, there is no evidence here\n\nthat any state adjudicatory body has ruled that the defendants are\n\nwrong to have taken corrective actions.                  See Sanchez-Lopez, 375\n\nF.3d at 131.        In short, we agree with the district court's\n\nassessment of the record: that there was no material dispute that\n\nthe plaintiffs' previous salary raises did not comport with Puerto\n\nRico law, and that the new administration's adjustments corrected\n\nthe inflated salaries by reducing them to the levels appropriate\n\nfor their respective positions.\n\n            The plaintiffs' assertion that the defendants imposed\n\nsalary    reductions    only    on   NPP    members,     and   not   on   similarly\n\nsituated PDP members, is not sufficient to rebut the defendants'\n\nshowing.    There is no indication in the record that there were any\n\nsimilarly    situated     PDP    members.         This    circumstance     is   not\n\nsurprising because it is unlikely that the NPP administration would\n\nplace members of the PDP into key policymaking trust positions, and\n\nit   is   even   more   unlikely     that   the   NPP     would   have    illegally\n\nincreased the salaries of any such PDP members on their return to\n\n\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\fcareer positions.   There is no evidence here of an inconsistently\n\napplied practice of remedying prior illegalities.9    See id. at 132.\n\nB.        Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Claims\n\n          The plaintiffs also appeal from the district court's\n\ndismissal of their equal protection claims.   The equal protection\n\nargument founders, however, because it is merely a \"restatement of\n\nappellant[s'] failed First Amendment claim[s].\"      Ruiz-Casillas v.\n\nCamacho-Morales, 415 F.3d 127, 134 (1st Cir. 2005); see also Nestor\n\nColon Medina & Sucesores, Inc. v. Custodio, 964 F.2d 32, 45 (1st\n\nCir. 1992) (declining to apply equal protection analysis in light\n\nof the overlap between plaintiffs' First Amendment and equal\n\nprotection claims).\n\nC.        Fourteenth Amendment Procedural Due Process Claims\n\n          The plaintiffs also appeal from the dismissal of their\n\nprocedural due process claims.    Although it is true that career\n\nemployees have a property interest in their continued employment\n\nunder Puerto Rico law, Figueroa-Serrano v. Ramos-Alverio, 221 F.3d\n\n1, 6 (1st Cir. 2000), the plaintiffs here were not terminated from\n\ntheir career positions, but rather only had their salaries by\n\nexception carved back. Further, Puerto Rico law does not recognize\n\na property interest in salaries paid to government employees that\n\n\n     9\n          Indeed, it is not clear that a political discrimination\nclaim could be maintained where reductions in salaries by exception\nare at issue, even when there is inconsistent application of\nregulatory discretion as to whether to reduce illegal salary\nincrements. We do not reach that issue.\n\n                               -14-\n\fare illegally awarded.         See Colón-Santiago, 438 F.3d at 109-11.\n\nAccordingly, there can be no viable procedural due process claims\n\nhere.      See Romero-Barcelo v. Hernandez-Agosto, 75 F.3d 23, 32 (1st\n\nCir. 1996) (requiring plaintiff to demonstrate a protected interest\n\nin   life,    liberty,   or   property   to   prevail   in    action   alleging\n\ndeprivation of procedural due process).\n\nD.            Supplemental Jurisdiction\n\n              Having   properly   dismissed     the     plaintiffs'    federal\n\nclaims,10 the district court did not abuse its discretion                    in\n\ndeclining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the claims\n\nbrought under Puerto Rico law.           See 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3); see\n\nalso Ramos-Piñero v. Puerto Rico, 453 F.3d 48, 55 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n                                    III.\n\n              For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.          Costs are awarded\n\nto defendants.\n\n\n\n\n      10\n          Since we agree with the district court that the\ndefendants were entitled to summary judgment on the federal claims,\nwe do not address the parties' arguments regarding qualified\nimmunity.\n\n                                    -15-\n\f",

Sometimes these actions violate the First Amendment, <i>see, e.g., Rodr&#237;guez-Mar&#237;n v. Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez,</i> 438 F.3d 72, 75-76 (1st Cir.2006), whereas other times, they do not, <i>see, e.g., V&#233;lez-Rivera</i> <i>v.

The new PDP administration assumed power on January 2, 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs in this case held various positions at the PSC in the former NPP administration, and all were affiliated with the NPP. Details as to each plaintiff and defendant may be found in the thoughtful opinion by the district court. <i>Morales Santiago,</i> 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34704, at *4-20. We describe the essential facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each of the plaintiffs, save one, had the following career path in common. Each was a member of the NPP and held a trust position in the PSC under a chairman affiliated with the NPP party. Each resigned that trust position several months before the November 2000 general election<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and/or before the October 2002 change in party control of the PSC's chairmanship.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Each was reinstated to his or her former career position or a similar career position,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> to which each was entitled under Puerto Rico law. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, &#167; 1350(8)(a) (2003 &amp; Supp.); <i>see also Rosario-Urdaz v. Velazco,</i> 433 F.3d 174, 176 (1st Cir.2006); <i>Gonz&#225;lez-de-Blasini v. Family Dep't,</i> 377 F.3d 81, 84 n. 1 (1st Cir.2004). However, each was rewarded by the then-NPP administration with a salary more commensurate with the previously held trust position than with the reinstated career position. This was done through a device called \"salary by exception.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October and November 2002, within approximately one month of the PDP's gaining control of the PSC's chairmanship, the PDP administration reduced the salaries of each plaintiff to within (or above) the range of his or her relevant career job classification. The new administration stated that it did this to correct excessive salaries illegally awarded by the outgoing NPP administration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Specifically, under the applicable regulations for re-entry to career service, an increase in salary by exception for an employee returning to career service from a trust position would have been authorized only if two conditions were met: (a) the employee had served in the same trust position for a continuous period of not less than five years, and (b) the employee's duties and responsibilities in the career position were equivalent to those in the trust position. Uniform Compensation Regulation, P.R. Reg. No. 3109, &#167; 4.8.7 (June 7, 1984). Even if those two conditions were met, it would have been discretionary whether the salary was raised, and any increase would have been limited by the maximum salary in the schedule for the career service position. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remaining plaintiff, Sonia Cede&#241;o-Acosta, served as Associate Commissioner of the PSC, a trust position, from April 2000 until November 2001. At that point in time, she returned to a career position and received a salary increase by exception. Shortly thereafter, she was appointed to a different trust position, where she remained until she was removed by the new PDP administration on September 30, 2002. Cede&#241;o-Acosta was reinstated to her previous career position at a salary that was substantially less than the salary she had been receiving in the trust position, but that was well within the range for the career position. All of the PSC's actions were taken pursuant to the Uniform Compensation Act, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, &#167;&#167; 760-760j (2003 &amp; Supp.), and regulations implementing that act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs filed suit, alleging primarily that the salary reductions by the defendant PDP administrators constituted political discrimination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> In addition to the First Amendment claim, the plaintiffs asserted equal protection and procedural due process claims, as well as various claims under Puerto Rico law. The general defense of the new administration was that the old NPP administration had violated Puerto Rico law by increasing the plaintiffs' salaries by exception and that Puerto Rico law fully authorized the corrective measures the new administration had taken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted summary judgment to the defendants on all federal claims, dismissing them with prejudice. <i>Morales Santiago,</i> 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34704, at *42. On the political discrimination claim, the district court found that the plaintiffs had failed to establish a prima facie case, by failing to adduce sufficient evidence that political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor in the salary reductions, in the face of the defendants' stated reasons that they acted to correct the illegality of the earlier personnel actions. <i>Id.</i> at *22, 35. The district court also found that the plaintiffs' evidence had failed to create a material issue of fact that they were entitled to their previous salaries, and that the adjusted salaries of all the plaintiffs were, at the least, at the upper end of the salary scale for their respective career positions. <i>Id.</i> at *34-35. Finally, the district court rejected the plaintiffs' reliance on various statements allegedly made by the defendants, finding such evidence insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to the defendants' motivation. <i>Id.</i> at *31-32.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held that the equal protection claim was essentially duplicative of the First Amendment claim and dismissed it for the same reasons. <i>Id.</i> at *36-37. The court also held that a post-deprivation hearing satisfied any constitutional due process requirements, noting that the plaintiffs had not been terminated from their jobs. <i>Id.</i> at *39-42. Having dismissed the plaintiffs' federal claims, and having found no independent basis for federal jurisdiction over the Puerto Rico law claims, the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction and dismissed the Puerto Rico law claims without prejudice. <i>Id.</i> at *42.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>First Amendment Political Discrimination Claims</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is an initial question of law as to whether the plaintiffs have stated a First Amendment claim at all with respect to the reduction of their higher salaries that had been previously raised by exception. The claim does not literally fall within the scope of <i>Rutan</i>'s extension of First Amendment protection from job dismissals to promotion, transfer, recall, or hiring decisions. 497 U.S. at 79, 110 S.Ct. 2729. Further, the analysis in <i>Rutan</i> as to why the protection extends to these categories of job actions does not flow readily to the reduction of salaries enhanced by exception. <i>See id.</i> at 71-79, 110 S.Ct. 2729. However, the defendants chose not to make this argument in their papers in the district court or here, although it did come up at oral argument. In the absence of briefing on the issue, we turn to the summary judgment argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Col&#243;n-Santiago v. Rosario,</i> 438 F.3d 101 (1st Cir.2006), this court provided a description of the relevant Puerto Rico employment law. <i>Id.</i> at 108-09. We highlight the key points for this case. Public employees in Puerto Rico are either confidential (trust) employees or career employees. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, &#167; 1349 (2003 &amp; Supp.).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> When a career employee moves to a trust position, the employee has a right to reinstatement to a position equivalent to the former career position, but may not retain the increased salary of the trust position. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1350(8)(a)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>; <i>see also Col&#243;n-Santiago,</i> 438 F.3d at 111.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court sagely observed, this has created the following dynamic. <i>Morales Santiago,</i> 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34704, at *20-21. It has become common in Puerto Rico that as an election approaches, the administration in power, as a political measure to protect its party members, returns its trust employees to their previous positions as career employees. They do so not at the salary then scheduled for the career position, as provided for by Puerto Rico law, <i>see, e.g.,</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, &#167; 1350(8)(a) (2003 &amp; Supp.), but rather at a salary in excess of that traditionally awarded for the position. <i>See, e.g., Cardona Martinez v. Rodriguez Qui&#241;ones,</i> 306 F.Supp.2d 89, 96-97 (D.P.R. 2004); <i>see also C&#233;spedes Rodr&#237;guez v. Rivera Hernandes,</i> 135 Fed.Appx. 441, 442 (1st Cir.2005) (per curiam). Where a higher salary by exception is awarded in violation of Puerto Rico law, the new administration has authority to reduce that excessive salary to the scheduled salary for the career position. <i>See Col&#243;n-Santiago,</i> 438 F.3d at 111; <i>Cardona Martinez,</i> 306 F.Supp.2d at 97-98. An employee whose salary is reduced may bring an appeal before the Appeals Board of the Personnel Administration System.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We simplify the analysis to whether there was evidence to create a material issue of fact that political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor in the salary reduction. Plaintiffs say that their salaries were reduced because the defendants knew that they were NPP members. Defendants counter that the salaries were reduced because the previous raises had been given in violation of Puerto Rico law and that these reductions would have occurred regardless of plaintiffs' political affiliation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs do not dispute that no disparate impact claim is recognized under <i>Rutan, see Sanchez-Lopez,</i> 375 F.3d at 140, but nonetheless argue that an inference of intentional discrimination is raised from the mere fact that they were all known NPP members and their salaries were reduced by the new PDP heads of the PSC. In context, that is not a rational inference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is quite likely that when a new administration looks to correct violations of Puerto Rico law as to the salaries of employees retained from the prior administration, the majority &#8212; if not all &#8212; of the corrections will be to salaries of persons belonging to the party of the now-deposed prior administration. Indeed, such corrective action may be needed to prevent abuse of the <i>Rutan</i> doctrine. <i>Rutan</i> is clear that the democratic process and, correspondingly, the electorate's decision to put a different political party in power should not be frustrated. 497 U.S. at 70, 110 S.Ct. 2729. The payment of unwarranted, higher salaries awarded by the prior administration would leave a new administration with fewer financial resources available to do the will of the voters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the Puerto Rico laws and regulations that put limits on the extent of government salaries were meant to secure compliance with Puerto Rico's constitutional policy of equal pay for equal work. <i>Col&#243;n-Santiago,</i> 438 F.3d at 109; <i>see also</i> P.R. Const. art. II, &#167; 16. These provisions also help prevent <i>Rutan</i> abuses by authorizing the new administration to take corrective actions to undo preferential salary adjustments given by a former administration to its stalwarts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs have offered no evidence that the defendants' position that the salaries were reduced to correct violations of Puerto Rico law is false.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Perhaps in rare cases such an explanation by administrators can be said clearly to be a pretext. Not here. The defendants submitted evidence establishing that the plaintiffs had failed to meet the prerequisites for any award of salary by exception. Further, there is no evidence here that any state adjudicatory body has ruled that the defendants are wrong to have taken corrective actions. <i>See Sanchez-Lopez,</i> 375 F.3d at 131. In short, we agree with the district court's assessment of the record: that there was no material dispute that the plaintiffs' previous salary raises did not comport with Puerto Rico law, and that the new administration's adjustments corrected the inflated salaries by reducing them to the levels appropriate for their respective positions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs' assertion that the defendants imposed salary reductions only on NPP members, and not on similarly situated PDP members, is not sufficient to rebut the defendants' showing. There is no indication in the record that there were any similarly situated PDP members. This circumstance is not surprising because it is unlikely that the NPP administration would place members of the PDP into key policymaking trust positions, and it is even more unlikely that the NPP would have illegally increased the salaries of any such PDP members on their return to career positions. There is no evidence here of an inconsistently applied practice of remedying prior illegalities.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> <i>See id.</i> at 132.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Claims</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs also appeal from the district court's dismissal of their equal protection claims.

LEXIS</span> <span class=\"page\">34704</span></span>, at *20-21. It has become common in Puerto Rico that as an election approaches, the administration in power, as a political measure to protect its party members, returns its trust employees to their previous positions as career employees. They do so not at the salary then scheduled for the career position, as provided for by Puerto Rico law, <i>see, e.g.,</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, &#167; 1350(8)(a) (2003 &amp; Supp.), but rather at a salary in excess of that traditionally awarded for the position. <i>See, e.g., Cardona Martinez v. Rodriguez Qui&#241;ones,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2526072\"><a href=\"/opinion/2526072/cardona-martinez-v-rodriguez-quinones/\"><span class=\"volume\">306</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Where a higher salary by exception is awarded in violation of Puerto Rico law, the new administration has authority to reduce that excessive salary to the scheduled salary for the career position. <i>See Col&#243;n-Santiago,</i> 438 F.3d at 111; <i>Cardona Martinez,</i> 306 F.Supp.2d at 97-98.

Plaintiffs say that their salaries were reduced because the defendants knew that they were NPP members. Defendants counter that the salaries were reduced because the previous raises had been given in violation of Puerto Rico law and that these reductions would have occurred regardless of plaintiffs' political affiliation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs do not dispute that no disparate impact claim is recognized under <i>Rutan, see Sanchez-Lopez,</i> 375 F.3d at 140, but nonetheless argue that an inference of intentional discrimination is raised from the mere fact that they were all known NPP members and their salaries were reduced by the new PDP heads of the PSC. In context, that is not a rational inference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is quite likely that when a new administration looks to correct violations of Puerto Rico law as to the salaries of employees retained from the prior administration, the majority &#8212; if not all &#8212; of the corrections will be to salaries of persons belonging to the party of the now-deposed prior administration. Indeed, such corrective action may be needed to prevent abuse of the <i>Rutan</i> doctrine. <i>Rutan</i> is clear that the democratic process and, correspondingly, the electorate's decision to put a different political party in power should not be frustrated. 497 U.S. at 70, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112472\"><a href=\"/opinion/112472/rutan-v-republican-party-of-ill/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The payment of unwarranted, higher salaries awarded by the prior administration would leave a new administration with fewer financial resources available to do the will of the voters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the Puerto Rico laws and regulations that put limits on the extent of government salaries were meant to secure compliance with Puerto Rico's constitutional policy of equal pay for equal work. <i>Col&#243;n-Santiago,</i> 438 F.3d at 109; <i>see also</i> P.R. Const. art. II, &#167; 16. These provisions also help prevent <i>Rutan</i> abuses by authorizing the new administration to take corrective actions to undo preferential salary adjustments given by a former administration to its stalwarts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs have offered no evidence that the defendants' position that the salaries were reduced to correct violations of Puerto Rico law is false.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Perhaps in rare cases such an explanation by administrators can be said clearly to be a pretext. Not here. The defendants submitted evidence establishing that the plaintiffs had failed to meet the prerequisites for any award of salary by exception. Further, there is no evidence here that any state adjudicatory body has ruled that the defendants are wrong to have taken corrective actions. <i>See Sanchez-Lopez,</i> 375 F.3d at 131. In short, we agree with the district court's assessment of the record: that there was no material dispute that the plaintiffs' previous salary raises did not comport with Puerto Rico law, and that the new administration's adjustments corrected the inflated salaries by reducing them to the levels appropriate for their respective positions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs' assertion that the defendants imposed salary reductions only on NPP members, and not on similarly situated PDP members, is not sufficient to rebut the defendants' showing. There is no indication in the record that there were any similarly situated PDP members. This circumstance is not surprising because it is unlikely that the NPP administration would place members of the PDP into key policymaking trust positions, and it is even more unlikely that the NPP would have illegally increased the salaries of any such PDP members on their return to career positions. There is no evidence here of an inconsistently applied practice of remedying prior illegalities.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> <i>See id.</i> at 132.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Claims</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs also appeal from the district court's dismissal of their equal protection claims.
