O'Brien for appellant.\n     Andrew E. Lelling, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief,\nfor appellee.\n\n\n\n                            July 19, 2007\n\f          HOWARD,   Circuit   Judge.     Carlos    Diaz    appeals    his\n\nconviction on charges of possessing and conspiring to distribute\n\nthe controlled drug ecstasy.     Diaz claims that (1) the district\n\ncourt should have suppressed evidence gleaned from the warrantless\n\nseizure of his cell phone, and (2) unexpected testimony by a\n\ngovernment witness that Diaz had illegally entered the United\n\nStates necessitated a mistrial.    We affirm.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          Just after midnight on October 16, 2001, three agents of\n\nthe Drug Enforcement Agency, accompanied by uniformed officers from\n\nthe local police department, arrived at an apartment in Lynn,\n\nMassachusetts.   The officers were led there by Ellis Martinez, who\n\nhad been arrested earlier that night for selling five hundred\n\necstasy tablets to an undercover DEA agent, Todd Prough.       Martinez\n\nsaid he had acquired the tablets at the apartment that day from a\n\nman known to him as \"Memello.\"    Martinez further recounted that he\n\nhad not paid Memello for the ecstasy, but had received it \"on\n\nconsignment,\" meaning that he was expected to sell it and repay\n\nMemello out of the proceeds that same night.              Martinez also\n\nprovided Prough with a brief physical description of both Memello\n\nand his vehicle, a gold Honda.\n\n          During    Martinez's    interrogation,    his    cell      phone\n\ncontinually rang, displaying a number he had previously identified\n\nas Memello's. Eventually, Prough and the other officers conducting\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fthe interrogation instructed Martinez to answer one of Memello's\n\ncalls, which Prough monitored and recorded. In this call, Martinez\n\nclaimed to have the money to repay Memello, and promised to deliver\n\nit to him shortly.        Prough, joined by other law enforcement\n\npersonnel, then proceeded to Memello's apartment to arrest him.\n\nPrough later explained that he did not seek an arrest warrant due\n\nto the difficulty of contacting a magistrate at the late hour and\n\nout of a concern that the attendant delay would arouse Memello's\n\nsuspicions as to Martinez's whereabouts, causing Memello to destroy\n\nevidence or to flee.\n\n          The officers approached the apartment, located on the\n\nsecond-floor of a multifamily house, by way of a back staircase.\n\nA gold Honda was parked outside.        The officers' badges were\n\nvisible, but their weapons were not drawn.        One of the local\n\nofficers knocked on the door.    When a woman opened it, the officer\n\nidentified his group as the police and asked to come in and talk to\n\nher.   The woman, later identified as Diaz's wife, Amanda Burgos,\n\nresponded by moving away from the door and gesturing to the\n\nofficers to enter.\n\n          Once inside the apartment, Prough observed a man sitting\n\nin the kitchen and asked him for his name.       The man identified\n\nhimself as Carlos Diaz.    Prough recognized him as Memello from his\n\nappearance, which fit the description provided by Martinez, and his\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fvoice, which Prough had heard while listening to their cell phone\n\nconversation.   Diaz was arrested and removed from the apartment.\n\n           Prough then asked Burgos whether the apartment contained\n\nany weapons or drugs; she said no.     He asked her for permission to\n\nsearch the apartment; she said yes.       While another officer was\n\nleaving the apartment to obtain a form for Burgos to sign to\n\nconsent to the search, Prough noticed a cell phone on the coffee\n\ntable in front of her.   Burgos indicated, in response to an inquiry\n\nfrom Prough, that the phone belonged to her husband, Diaz.    Prough\n\ndetermined that the phone was the same one that had been used to\n\nplace the call to Martinez earlier that evening.1        Prough then\n\nseized the phone.   After Burgos signed the consent form, another\n\nDEA agent, Michael O'Shaughnessy, examined the phone and determined\n\nthat it had been used to place a call to Martinez minutes before\n\nthe authorities arrived at the apartment that night.\n\n           Diaz was transported to the police station in Woburn,\n\nMassachusetts, where he was advised of and waived his Miranda\n\nrights.    When Prough told Diaz that he had been arrested for\n\ntrafficking in ecstasy, Diaz remarked, \"What a mess I got myself\n\ninto.   You got me for being a fool.\"   He proceeded to explain that\n\n\n\n1\n Prough could not recall whether he made this determination by\nusing Diaz's phone to call his own phone (so that Diaz's number\nwould appear through his caller identification feature), by using\nhis phone to call Diaz's number (so that the phone would ring), or\nby activating a function on the phone itself that caused it to\ndisplay its number.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fhe had entered the United States illegally some fifteen years\n\nprior. Under further interrogation from Prough, Diaz admitted that\n\nhe served as a middleman between buyers and sellers of ecstasy,\n\nfunneling approximately 1,000 tablets each week to Martinez and his\n\nprincipal, Tomas Cubilette.   Diaz further confessed to providing\n\nMartinez with the five hundred ecstasy tablets he had sold to\n\nPrough that day.     Diaz's confession was not video- or tape-\n\nrecorded, however, and he was never asked to put it in writing.\n\n           Before trial, Diaz moved to suppress the evidence seized\n\nfrom the apartment and his confession as the fruits of an illegal\n\nwarrantless entry and arrest. The district court denied the motion\n\nin a written memorandum and order issued after an evidentiary\n\nhearing.   The court ruled that (1) Burgos voluntarily gave her\n\nconsent to the officers' entry into the apartment, (2) the officers\n\nhad probable cause to arrest Diaz on sight, and (3) the cell phone\n\nwas lawfully seized under the \"plain view\" exception, see Horton v.\n\nCalifornia, 496 U.S. 128, 136-37 (1990).2\n\n           At trial, Prough served as the government's principal\n\nwitness against Diaz, relating the substance of his confession as\n\nwell as the aforementioned events of the night of October 15.   The\n\ngovernment also submitted toll records showing multiple calls\n\n\n2\n The district court also made the alternative rulings that (1)\nexigent circumstances permitted the warrantless entry, and (2) the\nseizure of the cell phone was within the scope of the consent\nBurgos had given to search the apartment. For reasons that will\nappear, we need not pass upon those rulings.\n\n                                -5-\n\fbetween Martinez's cell phone and Diaz's cell phone prior to Diaz's\n\narrest that night, and similar activity on a number of previous\n\noccasions when Prough had purchased, or attempted to purchase,\n\necstasy from Martinez.    Diaz's cell phone was also introduced into\n\nevidence, accompanied by testimony from O'Shaughnessy as to the\n\ncall from the phone to Martinez just before the authorities arrived\n\nat Diaz's apartment.\n\n           In describing Diaz's confession, Prough testified that\n\nDiaz had admitted to entering the United States illegally.         Diaz\n\nimmediately made an objection, which the district court sustained.3\n\nAt the end of that day of trial, Diaz moved for a mistrial on the\n\nbasis of this testimony, which he characterized as irrelevant and\n\nprejudicial.   Though the government opposed the motion, it took\n\n\"full   responsibility\"   for   Prough's   testimony:   the   prosecutor\n\nacknowledged that he could not recall whether he had instructed\n\nPrough not to mention Diaz's immigration status, despite assuring\n\ndefense counsel before trial that he would do so.4\n\n\n\n\n3\n Diaz did not move to strike the testimony because, as defense\ncounsel later explained, he did not want to call the jury's\nattention to it.\n4\n Diaz does not argue that the prosecutor's handling of the\nsituation amounted to intentional misconduct, e.g., that the\nprosecutor knowingly failed to tell Prough not to mention the\nsubject in hopes that he would. Cf. United States v. Sepulveda, 15\nF.3d 1161, 1185 (1st Cir. 1993) (considering claim that government\nviolated due process by purposely calling incompetent witness).\n\n                                  -6-\n\f            The district court denied the motion, concluding that the\n\ntestimony would not \"materially affect\" the outcome of the trial,\n\nbut offered to instruct the jury to disregard it.              Diaz, however,\n\ndid   not   take   the   court   up   on    its   offer,   believing   that   an\n\ninstruction would only highlight Prough's statement.                   The jury\n\nconvicted Diaz on both the possession and conspiracy charges.\n\n                                      II.\n\n                                       A.\n\n             Diaz appeals from the denial of his motion to suppress\n\nhis cell phone as the spoils of an unconstitutional warrantless\n\nentry and seizure.       He does not, however, separately question the\n\ndistrict court's conclusion that the officers had probable cause to\n\narrest him and that his confession was therefore legally obtained.\n\nIn passing on a district court's decision on a motion to suppress,\n\nwe scrutinize rulings of law de novo, but review findings of fact\n\nfor clear error only.       E.g., United States v. McCarthy, 475 F.3d\n\n39, 43 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n            The Fourth Amendment \"prohibits the police from making a\n\nwarrantless and nonconsensual entry into a suspect's home in order\n\nto make a routine felony arrest.\"             Payton v. New York, 445 U.S.\n\n573, 576 (1980).     Nevertheless, \"[t]he Fourth Amendment recognizes\n\na valid warrantless entry . . . when police obtain the voluntary\n\nconsent of an occupant who shares, or is reasonably believed to\n\nshare, authority over the area in common with a co-occupant who\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\flater objects to the use of evidence so obtained.\"      Georgia v.\n\nRandolph, 126 S.Ct. 1515, 1518 (2006).    When faced with such an\n\nobjection, the government has the burden to show by a preponderance\n\nof the evidence that the consent was voluntarily given. United\n\nStates v. Marshall, 348 F.3d 281, 285-86 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n          The district court found that Diaz's wife, Burgos, had\n\nvoluntarily consented to the arresting officers' entry into the\n\napartment.   Diaz does not challenge this result per se.    Instead,\n\nhe contends that the district court erroneously placed the burden\n\non him to prove that Burgos did not consent.   He bases this charge\n\non a statement in the court's order on the motion to suppress:\n\n     The problem in this case is that only one version of what\n     happened at the threshold of the door to the Burgos-Diaz\n     apartment was presented to me--that of [Special Agent]\n     Prough. Burgos did not testify. And while parts of the\n     Prough testimony troubled me, I have no basis to conclude\n     that Burgos' consent was not 'freely given' within the\n     meaning of the law.\n\nWe do not read this statement as placing the burden of proving\n\nvoluntary consent on Diaz.     Rather, the passage expresses the\n\ncourt's conclusion that Prough's testimony, despite its faults,\n\nsufficed to satisfy the government's burden in the absence of any\n\ncontradictory evidence.   We read the statement, in other words, as\n\nreflecting Diaz's failure to challenge the government's proof of\n\nvoluntary consent, not condemning his failure to prove otherwise in\n\nthe first instance.\n\n\n\n\n                                -8-\n\f           Indeed,   elsewhere     in   its   order,    the   district   court\n\nspecifically noted that the warrantless entry \"was presumptively\n\nillegal unless the government can justify exceptions to the Payton\n\nrule\" and that the law \"obligates the government to prove that\n\nconsent was, in fact, freely and voluntarily given.\" (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).         We are generally skeptical of claims\n\nthat a district court professed to apply one rule, but went on to\n\napply another; \"[a]fter all, an appellate tribunal ought not\n\nlightly assume that a federal trial judge is indulging in the\n\nadjudicatory equivalent of a shell game.\"           Lenn v. Portland Sch.\n\nComm., 998 F.2d 1083, 1088 (1st Cir. 1993) (collecting cases).              We\n\nsee no reason to dispense with such skepticism here.             We conclude\n\nthat the district court, in word and in deed, correctly placed the\n\nburden of proving voluntary consent on the government.\n\n           Diaz   also   claims    that,    even   if   the   district   court\n\nproperly found that Burgos validly consented to the officers'\n\nwarrantless entry, she did not validly consent to their warrantless\n\nsearch and seizure.      Specifically, Diaz argues that Burgos lacked\n\nthe authority to consent to either the search of the apartment or\n\nthe seizure of the cell phone.             We need not reach this issue,\n\nhowever.   In addition to finding that Burgos did consent to such a\n\nsearch, the district court ruled that the cell phone was legally\n\nseized under the \"plain view\" exception to the warrant requirement.\n\nThis conclusion appears sound, but, in any event, Diaz does not\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fquestion it on appeal.5     We affirm the district court's denial of\n\nthe motion to suppress, insofar as it challenged the seizure of the\n\ncell phone, on the basis of the \"plain view\" exception.\n\n                                    B.\n\n            Diaz also challenges the denial of his motion for a\n\nmistrial   based   on   Prough's   testimony   that   Diaz   had   admitted\n\nentering the United States illegally.      Because \"whether to declare\n\na mistrial speaks to the informed discretion of the district\n\ncourt,\" we review this decision for abuse of that discretion only.\n\nUnited States v. Keene, 287 F.3d 229, 233 (1st Cir. 2002).         Indeed,\n\n\"this precept possesses particular force when, as now, a motion for\n\nmistrial is based on a claim that some spontaneous development at\n\ntrial may have influenced the jury in an improper manner.\"           United\n\nStates v. Pierro, 32 F.3d 611, 617 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n\n\n\n5\n To the extent that he argues that the cellular telephone's\nassigned number was illegally obtained apart from the seizure of\nthe telephone, Diaz did not raise this claim in a timely and full\nfashion before the district court; review is thus for plain error\nonly. See, e.g., United States v. Burnette, 375 F.3d 10, 16 (1st\nCir. 2004) (reviewing suppression argument not raised below for\nplain error only), vacated on other grounds, 543 U.S. 1181 (2005).\nAs we have noted, it is unclear whether the method by which the\ninformation was gleaned constituted a search. In any event, as the\ngovernment argues unchallenged, probable cause existed to search\nfor the telephone number, and it inevitably would have been\ndiscovered, either in plain view or by search conducted pursuant to\na warrant.    There was no plain error in not suppressing the\nassigned telephone number. See, e.g., United States v. Procopio,\n88 F.3d 21, 27 (1st Cir. 1996) (holding that evidence is admissible\nif shown by preponderance that it inevitably would have been\ndiscovered by legal means).\n\n                                   -10-\n\f          We accept the notion, as does the government, that\n\nevidence of a defendant's illegal immigration status carries with\n\nit the potential for prejudice.          See United States v. Amaya-\n\nManzanares, 377 F.3d 39, 45 (1st Cir. 2004).          We agree with the\n\ndistrict court, however, that such potential went unrealized here.\n\n          First, the government's case against Diaz was sturdy,\n\nwith his full confession serving as its keystone.              While Diaz\n\npoints out that the confession was not transcribed, whatever doubt\n\nthis casts on its value was substantially dispelled by a raft of\n\ncorroborating evidence, including the toll records of calls to\n\nMartinez corresponding with the occasions on which he had sold\n\necstasy to Prough.   See, e.g., United States v. Fontanez, 291 F.3d\n\n88, 89 (1st Cir. 2002).         We have observed that such strong\n\nindependent evidence of guilt tends to lessen the effect of an\n\nimproper comment by a witness, making a mistrial unnecessary.          See\n\nUnited States v. DiSanto, 86 F.3d 1238, 1249 (1st Cir. 1996);\n\nUnited States v. Rullan-Rivera, 60 F.3d 16, 18 (1st Cir. 1995);\n\nUnited States v. Bello-Perez, 977 F.2d 664, 672 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n          Second,    after   Prough   stated   that   Diaz   had   admitted\n\nentering the country illegally, that fact was never mentioned\n\nagain, either in the balance of Prough's lengthy testimony or in\n\nthe prosecutor's closing arguments.       The isolated nature of the\n\noffending remark further cuts against any need for a mistrial. See\n\nUnited States v. Lee, 317 F.3d 26, 34-35 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\f            \"Declaring a mistrial is a last resort, only to be\n\nimplemented if the taint is ineradicable, that is, only if the\n\ntrial judge believes that the jury's exposure to the evidence is\n\nlikely to prove beyond realistic hope of repair.\"          Sepulveda, 15\n\nF.3d   at   1184.   Here,   the   district   court   reasonably   believed\n\notherwise, based on the fleeting nature of Prough's remark about\n\nDiaz's immigration status and the strength of the government's\n\nindependent evidence. Denying the motion for a mistrial, then, was\n\nnot an abuse of the district court's discretion.\n\n                                   III.\n\n            For the foregoing reasons, Diaz's conviction is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\f",

Carlos    Diaz    appeals    his\n\nconviction on charges of possessing and conspiring to distribute\n\nthe controlled drug ecstasy.     Diaz claims that (1) the district\n\ncourt should have suppressed evidence gleaned from the warrantless\n\nseizure of his cell phone, and (2) unexpected testimony by a\n\ngovernment witness that Diaz had illegally entered the United\n\nStates necessitated a mistrial.    We affirm.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          Just after midnight on October 16, 2001, three agents of\n\nthe Drug Enforcement Agency, accompanied by uniformed officers from\n\nthe local police department, arrived at an apartment in Lynn,\n\nMassachusetts.   The officers were led there by Ellis Martinez, who\n\nhad been arrested earlier that night for selling five hundred\n\necstasy tablets to an undercover DEA agent, Todd Prough.       Martinez\n\nsaid he had acquired the tablets at the apartment that day from a\n\nman known to him as \"Memello.\"    Martinez further recounted that he\n\nhad not paid Memello for the ecstasy, but had received it \"on\n\nconsignment,\" meaning that he was expected to sell it and repay\n\nMemello out of the proceeds that same night.              Martinez also\n\nprovided Prough with a brief physical description of both Memello\n\nand his vehicle, a gold Honda.\n\n          During    Martinez's    interrogation,    his    cell      phone\n\ncontinually rang, displaying a number he had previously identified\n\nas Memello's. Eventually, Prough and the other officers conducting\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fthe interrogation instructed Martinez to answer one of Memello's\n\ncalls, which Prough monitored and recorded. In this call, Martinez\n\nclaimed to have the money to repay Memello, and promised to deliver\n\nit to him shortly.        Prough, joined by other law enforcement\n\npersonnel, then proceeded to Memello's apartment to arrest him.\n\nPrough later explained that he did not seek an arrest warrant due\n\nto the difficulty of contacting a magistrate at the late hour and\n\nout of a concern that the attendant delay would arouse Memello's\n\nsuspicions as to Martinez's whereabouts, causing Memello to destroy\n\nevidence or to flee.\n\n          The officers approached the apartment, located on the\n\nsecond-floor of a multifamily house, by way of a back staircase.\n\nA gold Honda was parked outside.        The officers' badges were\n\nvisible, but their weapons were not drawn.        One of the local\n\nofficers knocked on the door.    When a woman opened it, the officer\n\nidentified his group as the police and asked to come in and talk to\n\nher.   The woman, later identified as Diaz's wife, Amanda Burgos,\n\nresponded by moving away from the door and gesturing to the\n\nofficers to enter.\n\n          Once inside the apartment, Prough observed a man sitting\n\nin the kitchen and asked him for his name.       The man identified\n\nhimself as Carlos Diaz.    Prough recognized him as Memello from his\n\nappearance, which fit the description provided by Martinez, and his\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fvoice, which Prough had heard while listening to their cell phone\n\nconversation.   Diaz was arrested and removed from the apartment.\n\n           Prough then asked Burgos whether the apartment contained\n\nany weapons or drugs; she said no.     He asked her for permission to\n\nsearch the apartment; she said yes.       While another officer was\n\nleaving the apartment to obtain a form for Burgos to sign to\n\nconsent to the search, Prough noticed a cell phone on the coffee\n\ntable in front of her.   Burgos indicated, in response to an inquiry\n\nfrom Prough, that the phone belonged to her husband, Diaz.    Prough\n\ndetermined that the phone was the same one that had been used to\n\nplace the call to Martinez earlier that evening.1        Prough then\n\nseized the phone.   After Burgos signed the consent form, another\n\nDEA agent, Michael O'Shaughnessy, examined the phone and determined\n\nthat it had been used to place a call to Martinez minutes before\n\nthe authorities arrived at the apartment that night.\n\n           Diaz was transported to the police station in Woburn,\n\nMassachusetts, where he was advised of and waived his Miranda\n\nrights.    When Prough told Diaz that he had been arrested for\n\ntrafficking in ecstasy, Diaz remarked, \"What a mess I got myself\n\ninto.   You got me for being a fool.\"   He proceeded to explain that\n\n\n\n1\n Prough could not recall whether he made this determination by\nusing Diaz's phone to call his own phone (so that Diaz's number\nwould appear through his caller identification feature), by using\nhis phone to call Diaz's number (so that the phone would ring), or\nby activating a function on the phone itself that caused it to\ndisplay its number.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fhe had entered the United States illegally some fifteen years\n\nprior. Under further interrogation from Prough, Diaz admitted that\n\nhe served as a middleman between buyers and sellers of ecstasy,\n\nfunneling approximately 1,000 tablets each week to Martinez and his\n\nprincipal, Tomas Cubilette.   Diaz further confessed to providing\n\nMartinez with the five hundred ecstasy tablets he had sold to\n\nPrough that day.     Diaz's confession was not video- or tape-\n\nrecorded, however, and he was never asked to put it in writing.\n\n           Before trial, Diaz moved to suppress the evidence seized\n\nfrom the apartment and his confession as the fruits of an illegal\n\nwarrantless entry and arrest. The district court denied the motion\n\nin a written memorandum and order issued after an evidentiary\n\nhearing.   The court ruled that (1) Burgos voluntarily gave her\n\nconsent to the officers' entry into the apartment, (2) the officers\n\nhad probable cause to arrest Diaz on sight, and (3) the cell phone\n\nwas lawfully seized under the \"plain view\" exception, see Horton v.\n\nCalifornia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112448\"><a href=\"/opinion/112448/horton-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">128</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 136-37 (1990).2\n\n           At trial, Prough served as the government's principal\n\nwitness against Diaz, relating the substance of his confession as\n\nwell as the aforementioned events of the night of October 15.   The\n\ngovernment also submitted toll records showing multiple calls\n\n\n2\n The district court also made the alternative rulings that (1)\nexigent circumstances permitted the warrantless entry, and (2) the\nseizure of the cell phone was within the scope of the consent\nBurgos had given to search the apartment. For reasons that will\nappear, we need not pass upon those rulings.\n\n                                -5-\n\fbetween Martinez's cell phone and Diaz's cell phone prior to Diaz's\n\narrest that night, and similar activity on a number of previous\n\noccasions when Prough had purchased, or attempted to purchase,\n\necstasy from Martinez.    Diaz's cell phone was also introduced into\n\nevidence, accompanied by testimony from O'Shaughnessy as to the\n\ncall from the phone to Martinez just before the authorities arrived\n\nat Diaz's apartment.\n\n           In describing Diaz's confession, Prough testified that\n\nDiaz had admitted to entering the United States illegally.         Diaz\n\nimmediately made an objection, which the district court sustained.3\n\nAt the end of that day of trial, Diaz moved for a mistrial on the\n\nbasis of this testimony, which he characterized as irrelevant and\n\nprejudicial.   Though the government opposed the motion, it took\n\n\"full   responsibility\"   for   Prough's   testimony:   the   prosecutor\n\nacknowledged that he could not recall whether he had instructed\n\nPrough not to mention Diaz's immigration status, despite assuring\n\ndefense counsel before trial that he would do so.4\n\n\n\n\n3\n Diaz did not move to strike the testimony because, as defense\ncounsel later explained, he did not want to call the jury's\nattention to it.\n4\n Diaz does not argue that the prosecutor's handling of the\nsituation amounted to intentional misconduct, e.g., that the\nprosecutor knowingly failed to tell Prough not to mention the\nsubject in hopes that he would.

Diaz, however,\n\ndid   not   take   the   court   up   on    its   offer,   believing   that   an\n\ninstruction would only highlight Prough's statement.

E.g., United States v. McCarthy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202621\"><a href=\"/opinion/202621/united-states-v-mccarty/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 43 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n            The Fourth Amendment \"prohibits the police from making a\n\nwarrantless and nonconsensual entry into a suspect's home in order\n\nto make a routine felony arrest.\"             Payton v.

When faced with such an\n\nobjection, the government has the burden to show by a preponderance\n\nof the evidence that the consent was voluntarily given. United\n\nStates v. Marshall, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200712\"><a href=\"/opinion/200712/united-states-v-marshall/\"><span class=\"volume\">348</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">281</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 285-86 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n          The district court found that Diaz's wife, Burgos, had\n\nvoluntarily consented to the arresting officers' entry into the\n\napartment.   Diaz does not challenge this result per se.    Instead,\n\nhe contends that the district court erroneously placed the burden\n\non him to prove that Burgos did not consent.   He bases this charge\n\non a statement in the court's order on the motion to suppress:\n\n     The problem in this case is that only one version of what\n     happened at the threshold of the door to the Burgos-Diaz\n     apartment was presented to me--that of [Special Agent]\n     Prough. Burgos did not testify. And while parts of the\n     Prough testimony troubled me, I have no basis to conclude\n     that Burgos' consent was not 'freely given' within the\n     meaning of the law.\n\nWe do not read this statement as placing the burden of proving\n\nvoluntary consent on Diaz.     Rather, the passage expresses the\n\ncourt's conclusion that Prough's testimony, despite its faults,\n\nsufficed to satisfy the government's burden in the absence of any\n\ncontradictory evidence.   We read the statement, in other words, as\n\nreflecting Diaz's failure to challenge the government's proof of\n\nvoluntary consent, not condemning his failure to prove otherwise in\n\nthe first instance.\n\n\n\n\n                                -8-\n\f           Indeed,   elsewhere     in   its   order,    the   district   court\n\nspecifically noted that the warrantless entry \"was presumptively\n\nillegal unless the government can justify exceptions to the Payton\n\nrule\" and that the law \"obligates the government to prove that\n\nconsent was, in fact, freely and voluntarily given.\" (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).         We are generally skeptical of claims\n\nthat a district court professed to apply one rule, but went on to\n\napply another; \"[a]fter all, an appellate tribunal ought not\n\nlightly assume that a federal trial judge is indulging in the\n\nadjudicatory equivalent of a shell game.\"           Lenn v. Portland Sch.\n\nComm., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"611562\"><a href=\"/opinion/611562/daniel-lenn-etc-v-portland-school-committee/\"><span class=\"volume\">998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1083</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1088 (1st Cir. 1993) (collecting cases).              We\n\nsee no reason to dispense with such skepticism here.             We conclude\n\nthat the district court, in word and in deed, correctly placed the\n\nburden of proving voluntary consent on the government.\n\n           Diaz   also   claims    that,    even   if   the   district   court\n\nproperly found that Burgos validly consented to the officers'\n\nwarrantless entry, she did not validly consent to their warrantless\n\nsearch and seizure.      Specifically, Diaz argues that Burgos lacked\n\nthe authority to consent to either the search of the apartment or\n\nthe seizure of the cell phone.             We need not reach this issue,\n\nhowever.   In addition to finding that Burgos did consent to such a\n\nsearch, the district court ruled that the cell phone was legally\n\nseized under the \"plain view\" exception to the warrant requirement.\n\nThis conclusion appears sound, but, in any event, Diaz does not\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fquestion it on appeal.5     We affirm the district court's denial of\n\nthe motion to suppress, insofar as it challenged the seizure of the\n\ncell phone, on the basis of the \"plain view\" exception.\n\n                                    B.\n\n            Diaz also challenges the denial of his motion for a\n\nmistrial   based   on   Prough's   testimony   that   Diaz   had   admitted\n\nentering the United States illegally.      Because \"whether to declare\n\na mistrial speaks to the informed discretion of the district\n\ncourt,\" we review this decision for abuse of that discretion only.\n\nUnited States v.

Indeed,\n\n\"this precept possesses particular force when, as now, a motion for\n\nmistrial is based on a claim that some spontaneous development at\n\ntrial may have influenced the jury in an improper manner.\"           United\n\nStates v.

See, e.g., United States v. Burnette, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786890\"><a href=\"/opinion/786890/united-states-v-cheryl-burnette/\"><span class=\"volume\">375</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 16 (1st\nCir. 2004) (reviewing suppression argument not raised below for\nplain error only), vacated on other grounds, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1181</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2005).\nAs we have noted, it is unclear whether the method by which the\ninformation was gleaned constituted a search. In any event, as the\ngovernment argues unchallenged, probable cause existed to search\nfor the telephone number, and it inevitably would have been\ndiscovered, either in plain view or by search conducted pursuant to\na warrant.    There was no plain error in not suppressing the\nassigned telephone number. See, e.g., United States v.

See United States v.

We agree with the\n\ndistrict court, however, that such potential went unrealized here.\n\n          First, the government's case against Diaz was sturdy,\n\nwith his full confession serving as its keystone.              While Diaz\n\npoints out that the confession was not transcribed, whatever doubt\n\nthis casts on its value was substantially dispelled by a raft of\n\ncorroborating evidence, including the toll records of calls to\n\nMartinez corresponding with the occasions on which he had sold\n\necstasy to Prough.   See, e.g., United States v.

We have observed that such strong\n\nindependent evidence of guilt tends to lessen the effect of an\n\nimproper comment by a witness, making a mistrial unnecessary.          See\n\nUnited States v.

The isolated nature of the\n\noffending remark further cuts against any need for a mistrial. See\n\nUnited States v.
