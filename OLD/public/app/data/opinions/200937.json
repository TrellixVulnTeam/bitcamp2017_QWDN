Michael A. Ponsor, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n                Lynch and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Thomas J. Butters, with whom Butters, Brazilian & Small LLP\nwas on brief, for appellant.\n     Andrew Levchuk, Assistant U.S. Attorney, with whom Michael J.\nSullivan was on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         March 30, 2004\n\f              HOWARD, Circuit Judge.        In March 2002, Frank Iacaboni\n\npleaded guilty to charges arising out of his operation of an\n\nillegal   gambling     business.      He    appeals        the       district     court's\n\nsubsequent forfeiture order, contending that the court erred in its\n\ndetermination that $384,245 should be forfeited.                         Concluding that\n\nthe district court’s reasoning is sound as to the bulk of the\n\naward, we affirm in part, but reverse and remand as to one category\n\nof funds included in the forfeiture.\n\n                 I.    Factual and Procedural Background\n\n              From 1995 through March 1998, Iacaboni conducted an\n\nillegal      sports   gambling   operation      in    and       around       Leominster,\n\nMassachusetts.        Iacaboni's     business     included           a    few   different\n\n\"offices\" headed by individuals hired to take bets from gamblers\n\nover   the    telephone.     Iacaboni      also      ran    a    \"football        ticket\"\n\nbusiness; bettors paid between $1 and $10 per \"ticket,\" a card on\n\nwhich they checked off four or more predictions in dozens of\n\nupcoming games.\n\n              In May 2001, a grand jury indicted Iacaboni on charges of\n\nconspiracy to conduct an illegal gambling business (Count I), 18\n\nU.S.C. § 371; operating an illegal gambling business (Count II), 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1955; conspiracy to conduct an illegal gambling business\n\ninvolving      interstate   travel    (Count      III),         18       U.S.C.   §   371;\n\nconspiracy to launder money from 1995 to March 1998 (Count IV), 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1956(h); and money laundering on December 23, 1997 (Count\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fV), 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(A)(i).     The indictment also included\n\nforfeiture allegations seeking \"any property, real or personal,\n\ninvolved in\" Iacaboni's violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1956.   18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 982(a)(1).   At his arraignment, Iacaboni entered a plea of not\n\nguilty on all charges.\n\n          On March 26, 2002, Iacaboni changed his plea to guilty on\n\nCounts I through IV of the indictment, and the government agreed to\n\ndismiss Count V.    Iacaboni also pleaded guilty to a criminal\n\ninformation charging him with money laundering in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i) in connection with the December 23, 1997\n\ntransaction that had been the subject of Count V.1\n\n          In April 2002, the court held a bench trial on the\n\nforfeiture allegations.   The government presented the testimony of\n\ntwo of Iacaboni's employees, Robert Bolaski and Ryan Gallagher.\n\nThey described their day-to-day duties, the size of their typical\n\nclient roster (40 to 50 for Bolaski, and 15 to 20 for Gallagher),\n\nand their weekly salaries (ranging from $300 to $350).     Bolaski\n\nestimated that Iacaboni's business might owe approximately $15,000\n\nto $20,000 to winning bettors during a bad week, and expect to\n\ncollect $20,000 to $25,000 from losing bettors during a good week.\n\n\n\n     1\n      The December 23, 1997 transaction involved an attempted\ntransfer of $10,000 to an individual the government alleged to be\nan organized crime figure. United States v. Iacaboni, 221 F. Supp.\n2d 104, 109-10, 117 (D. Mass. 2002). Because Iacaboni does not\ncontest the inclusion of these funds in the forfeiture order, the\ndetails of this transaction are not recounted here.\n\n                                -3-\n\fGallagher   testified   that     his    office    paid   out   an   average   of\n\napproximately $10,000 per week to winning bettors over the course\n\nof a seventeen-week football season.             Both Bolaski and Gallagher\n\ntestified that the volume of betting varied.\n\n            Larry Landman, one of Iacaboni's bettors, also testified\n\nat trial.    He testified that he bet every weekend during football\n\nseason, and that occasionally when he owed money to Iacaboni, he\n\nwould send “personal checks” made out to the defendant.2                      He\n\nsometimes made the notation \"personal loan\" on the checks, a\n\npractice that was his own idea, not one suggested by Iacaboni.\n\nIacaboni deposited Landman's checks into his personal account. The\n\ngovernment presented evidence of nineteen checks given to Iacaboni\n\nby Landman, only nine of which were relevant to the forfeiture\n\nanalysis    because   of   the     applicable       five-year       statute   of\n\nlimitations.    These nine checks, deposited between May 1996 and\n\nDecember 1996, totaled $7,385.3\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      These payments were technically made by personal money order,\nbut were commonly referred to by the parties as \"checks.\" Because\nthe distinction is insignificant in our analysis, we adopt the\n“check” label used below.\n     3\n      The district court found that the government had presented\nevidence of twenty-one checks, ten of which fell within the statute\nof limitations and totaled $7,495. Iacaboni, 221 F. Supp. 2d at\n108.   Our review of the record reveals that evidence of only\nnineteen transactions was introduced by the government, and that\nthe district court mistakenly counted a $110 cash deposit as a\ntenth \"check\" in its calculation of amounts paid by Landman.\n\n                                       -4-\n\f              The court also heard testimony from Robert Davies, an\n\nagent    of     Iacaboni's,     and   Tina   LeClair,    Iacaboni's    former\n\ngirlfriend.      These witnesses, along with Bolaski, described the\n\noperation of the football ticket business, including how bets were\n\nplaced and winnings distributed.\n\n              In June 2002, Iacaboni was sentenced to ten months in\n\ncustody, a fine of $30,000, and three years' supervised release.\n\nThe district court heard argument on the forfeiture allegations\n\nsoon thereafter.         In August 2002, the district court ordered\n\nIacaboni to forfeit $384,245 pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(1).\n\nThis amount included (1) $340,000 in funds paid to winning phone-in\n\nbettors over the 1996 and 1997 football seasons; (2) $10,000 in\n\nfunds    paid    to   winning   football     ticket   bettors;   (3)   $10,000\n\nrepresenting funds involved in the December 23, 1997 transaction;\n\n(4) $7,495 in checks from Landman; (5) $16,150 in salaries; and (6)\n\n$600 in phone expenses.4        The district court declined to order that\n\nIacaboni forfeit his residence in Leominster, a penalty sought by\n\nthe government.5       This appeal followed.\n\n\n     4\n      On appeal, Iacaboni does not contest the forfeitability of\nitems (3) and (6), the $10,000 in funds transferred on December 23,\n1997, see n.1, above, and the $600 in phone expenses.\n     5\n      The government had argued that the property was subject to\nforfeiture under 18 U.S.C. § 1956. The district court disagreed,\nconcluding that \"it is not enough merely to show that the Union St.\nproperty was involved in the gambling operation; the Government\nmust demonstrate that the house was involved in money laundering.\"\nIacaboni, 221 F. Supp. 2d at 116.         Although the government\ninitially cross-appealed, United States v. Iacaboni, No. 02-2259,\n\n                                      -5-\n\f                               II.     Analysis\n\n              Iacaboni contends that the district court erred in its\n\ndetermination of the amount to be forfeited because (1) the payouts\n\nto winning bettors were integral to the illegal gambling business\n\nand therefore could not be considered property involved in money\n\nlaundering; (2) there was insufficient evidence to support a\n\nfinding that $340,000 was paid out to phone-in bettors; and (3) the\n\nLandman checks were not property involved in money laundering.\n\nA.            Payments to Winning Bettors\n\n              We review de novo the district court's determination of\n\nwhat       constitutes   forfeitable     proceeds     under   18   U.S.C.   §\n\n1956(a)(1)(A)(i).        The   court   found   that   $350,000,    an   amount\n\nrepresenting payments to winning bettors, should be forfeited.6\n\nThe statute provides:\n\n              (a)(1) Whoever, knowing that the property\n              involved in a financial transaction represents\n              the proceeds of some form of unlawful\n              activity, conducts or attempts to conduct such\n              a financial transaction which in fact involves\n              the proceeds of specified unlawful activity\n              (A)(i) with the intent to promote the carrying\n              on of specified unlawful activity;\n              shall be sentenced to a fine of not more than\n              $500,000 or twice the value of the property\n\n\nthat appeal was later voluntarily dismissed.\n       6\n      Although the forfeiture of funds a defendant has transferred\naway may seem an unusual concept, detailed statutory provisions\nhave been designed to accomplish this very end in drug and money\nlaundering cases, and the defendant has not argued that these\nprovisions are inapplicable. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 982(a), (b)(1); 21\nU.S.C. § 853(p).\n\n                                       -6-\n\f           involved in        the    transaction,     whichever   is\n           greater[.]\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1956.7\n\n           Looking to the language of the statute, we first consider\n\nwhether the payments to winning bettors constituted financial\n\ntransactions    involving      the    proceeds   of    illegal    gambling,   a\n\nspecified unlawful activity. Id. § 1956(a)(1). The district court\n\nconcluded that this portion of the statute had been satisfied,\n\nnoting   the   breadth   of    the    terms   \"financial    transaction\"   and\n\n\"proceeds.\"    Iacaboni, 221 F. Supp. 2d at 111-12.\n\n           Iacaboni does not contest his participation in “financial\n\ntransactions,” but he does argue that \"proceeds\" refers to net\n\nincome of the illegal gambling operation, not payouts, citing\n\nUnited States v. Scialabba, 282 F.3d 475 (7th Cir. 2002), cert.\n\ndenied, 537 U.S. 1071 (2002). There, the Seventh Circuit held that\n\nmoney paid to winning players in an illegal video poker scheme\n\ncould not be considered proceeds, defining proceeds as net profits.\n\nWe have previously rejected Iacaboni’s interpretation of the term\n\n“proceeds” in the RICO forfeiture context.              See United States v.\n\nHurley, 63 F.3d 1, 21 (1st Cir. 1995)(quoting legislative history\n\nof RICO forfeiture provisions for the proposition that “the term\n\n\n     7\n      Section 1956(a)(1)(A)(i) prohibits conduct sometimes referred\nto as \"promotional\" money laundering. Unlike \"concealment\" money\nlaundering (i.e. financial transactions designed to conceal the\nsource of     the  funds   or   to  avoid   transaction   reporting\nrequirements), which is governed by 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(B), an\nintent to conceal is not an element of the crime.\n\n                                       -7-\n\f‘proceeds’ has been used in lieu of the term ‘profits’ in order to\n\nalleviate the unreasonable burden on the government of proving net\n\nprofits”).      Iacaboni has offered no rationale for abandoning that\n\napproach here.\n\n              Concluding    that      Iacaboni’s    financial   transactions\n\ninvolved “proceeds” within the meaning of § 1956(a)(1), we turn to\n\nwhether the transactions were intended to promote the gambling\n\noperation.       Iacaboni asserts that payments to winning bettors\n\ncannot be considered \"promotion\" because these payments were an\n\nintegral part of the illegal gambling business.             Defining payouts\n\nas promotion, Iacaboni contends, is an impermissible alternative\n\npunishment for operating a gambling business.               He argues for an\n\ninterpretation of the statute that would require an additional\n\npromotional step beyond the mere operation of the illegal venture.\n\n              In addressing this argument, the district court opined\n\nthat the payouts were not typical examples of promotion money\n\nlaundering (such as the “plowing back” or reinvestment of criminal\n\nproceeds through the payment of business expenses, see B. Frederic\n\nWilliams, Jr. & Frank D. Whitney, Federal Money Laundering: Crimes\n\nand Forfeitures 137-39 (1999)).          The court also opined that, under\n\nthe   logic    advanced    by   the   government,    \"any   illegal   gambling\n\noperation would also be a money laundering operation.\"                Iacaboni,\n\n221 F. Supp. 2d at 113.         But the court nevertheless concluded that\n\nthe transactions fell within the reach of § 1956(a)(1)(A)(i), in\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fpart    because    \"[n]othing       makes    an   illegal       gambling       operation\n\nflourish more than the prompt payment of winners,” id. at 114\n\n(citing United States v. Febus, 218 F.3d 784, 790 (7th Cir. 2000)),\n\nand in part because it was not \"fundamentally unfair to view as\n\nmoney laundering the conduct of defendant that took the proceeds of\n\nhis illegal business and used them to increase the popularity and\n\nviability of his criminal operation by paying his winners.\"                            Id.\n\n               We agree with the district court, and affirm on the\n\ngrounds   set     forth     in   its   opinion,    as    well      as   the    following\n\nconsiderations.            Crimes   such    as   the   operation        of    an   illegal\n\ngambling ring create huge sums of cash, the use or disposition of\n\nwhich can prove problematic for illegal gambling operators who wish\n\nto stay beneath the radar of law enforcement agencies.                        Depositing\n\nthe    funds    with   a    financial      institution       can   trigger         currency\n\ntransaction reporting requirements, see Hurley, 63 F.3d at 12\n\n(citing 31 U.S.C. § 5313), which in turn can bring the depositor\n\nthe unwanted attention of the Internal Revenue Service or other\n\ngovernment agencies.\n\n               Criminals dealing in large amounts of cash who wish to\n\navoid the risks and practical difficulties of “putting it in the\n\nmattress” have thus developed strategies to avoid the creation of\n\na paper trail that can lead to apprehension.                        They frequently\n\n“structure”       their     cash    deposits      so    as    to    avoid      reporting\n\nrequirement triggers, see United States v. Saccoccia, 58 F.3d 754,\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\f762 n.1 (1st Cir. 1995) (describing subdivision of cash into\n\n“smaller,     unreportable      amounts,”       a     process        also    known   as\n\n“smurfing”);      use   the    cash    to     purchase        valuables,      see    id.\n\n(recounting scheme whereby proceeds from Columbian drug cartel were\n\nlaundered through purchases of gold); and use the cash to promote,\n\nor “move forward,” Webster's Third New International Dictionary\n\n1815 (1993), the unlawful scheme by which the cash was derived or\n\nanother unlawful scheme, see United States v. London, 66 F.3d 1227,\n\n1242-43 (1st Cir. 1995) (upholding money laundering conviction of\n\noperator of check-cashing business whose intentional failure to\n\nfile   currency    transaction        reports       benefitted        his    bookmaking\n\nclientele).       Recognizing     the    prevalence           of    these    evasionary\n\nstrategies, Congress in 1986 enacted § 1956 to outlaw (1) the\n\nstructuring of financial transactions so as to avoid currency\n\nreporting requirements or to conceal the source of the funds, and\n\n(2)    the   promotion    of    unlawful        activity           through    financial\n\ntransactions    involving      the    proceeds       of   a    specified       unlawful\n\nactivity (of which running an unlawful gambling operation is one,\n\nsee United States v. LeBlanc, 24 F.3d 340, 346 (1st Cir. 1994)).\n\nThus the statute’s two “prongs.”            See n.7, above.\n\n             In our view, Iacaboni misses the point in asserting that\n\ndefining the payouts as promotion would constitute an impermissible\n\nalternative punishment for an act that is an integral component of\n\n\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\fan unlawful gambling business.8 Targeting the payouts reflects the\n\ndecision of Congress (embodied in § 1956) to proscribe not only\n\ncertain unlawful cash-generating schemes, but also the means by\n\nwhich       they   are   practically    carried   out   and   hidden     from\n\ninvestigators.       See LeBlanc, 24 F.3d at 346 (“Congress intended to\n\ncriminalize a broad array of transactions designed to facilitate\n\nnumerous federal crimes, including illegal gambling.”).                Such a\n\nproscription empowers law enforcement to combat such schemes not\n\nonly from a direct operational perspective, but also from the more\n\nindirect financial angle.         Viewed in this light, the district\n\ncourt’s decision to forfeit the payouts to winning gamblers is\n\nconsonant with the purposes for which Congress enacted 18 U.S.C. §\n\n1956(a)(1)(A)(i).9        We hasten to add that we are only deciding\n\n\n     8\n      Of course, as we read the statutes, a gambling operation and\nmoney laundering will often occur together but each requires an\nelement that the other does not, United States v. Conley, 37 F.3d\n970, 978-79 (3d Cir. 1994), thereby satisfying the Blockburger\ntest. Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299 (1932). We do\nnot share the Seventh Circuit's doubts on this issue expressed in\nUnited States v. Scialabba, 282 F.3d 475, 477 (7th Cir. 2002).\nThere might, of course, be concerns if the government sought to\nforfeit the same property twice, but that is not a problem\npresented in this case. Cf. United States v. Cunan, 156 F.3d 110,\n116 (1st Cir. 1998).\n        9\n      In his brief, Iacaboni ends his argument regarding the\nimproper characterization of payouts as promotion with the\nstatement: \"For the same reason, the Court should also vacate the\nDistrict Court's forfeiture order as it pertains to the $16,150 in\nsalaries paid to agents.\"    Iacaboni Br. at 22-23.    Even if we\nconsider this issue despite Iacaboni's failure to brief it\nproperly, see United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.\n1990), the argument has no merit.     The payment of salaries of\nemployees is a common example of promotion within the meaning of\n\n                                       -11-\n\fwhether the facts of this case come within the term \"promote\" as\n\nused in this statute, and not as that term may have been used by\n\nCongress elsewhere in federal law.\n\nB.         Calculation of Amount of Payments to Winning Phone-In\n           Bettors\n\n           Iacaboni contends that even if the payments to winning\n\nbettors are properly characterized as promotion money laundering\n\nand thus forfeitable, the district court erred in calculating the\n\namounts paid to winning phone-in bettors.             The court found that\n\nGallagher testified credibly that his office paid out an average of\n\napproximately $10,000 per week during the seventeen-week football\n\nseason.   The court concluded therefore that approximately $170,000\n\nwas paid out during each football season, totaling $340,000 over\n\nthe course of two years. This calculation was based on Gallagher's\n\noffice only,10 and did not include bets on the playoffs or the Super\n\nBowl.     Likewise,   it   included   only   wagers    on   football   games,\n\nalthough the Iacaboni operation also took bets on baseball, hockey\n\n\n\nthe statute. See Febus, 218 F.3d at 790; United States v. Leonard,\n61 F.3d 1181, 1186 (5th Cir. 1995); see also B. Frederic Williams,\nJr. & Frank D. Whitney, Federal Money Laundering: Crimes and\nForfeitures 137 (1999) (“A manufacturer of cars would think it\nstrange if one asserted that the payment of wages for its workers\non the assembly line and for steel or other raw materials were not\nintended to help promote the company’s continuation and success in\nthe car industry.”). We uphold the district court’s finding that\n$16,150 in salaries is subject to forfeiture.\n     10\n      The district court heard testimony that there were at least\nthree offices in addition to Gallagher's within the Iacaboni\noperation.\n\n                                  -12-\n\fand basketball.\n\n              The    district      court's     factual      findings       regarding         the\n\namounts paid to winning phone-in bettors are reviewed for clear\n\nerror.     See United States v. 15 Bosworth Street, 236 F.3d 50, 53\n\n(1st Cir. 2001)(noting, in civil forfeiture context, that \"the\n\nappellate process ought to respect the trial judge's superior feel\n\nfor the case and his enhanced ability to weigh and evaluate\n\nconflicting evidence\" (internal quotation omitted)).                            The findings\n\nwere based in part on a credibility determination to which we\n\nextend great deference, and in part on commonsense extrapolation.\n\nWe conclude that the district court's findings were sound in light\n\nof the small segment of Iacaboni's business on which they were\n\nbased.     Indeed, the amount ordered forfeited appears to be a\n\nreasonable and fair estimate.\n\nC.            Landman Checks\n\n              Iacaboni      contests    the     district      court's       finding      that\n\n$7,495   in    checks       Landman    paid     to   Iacaboni       were     forfeitable,\n\nalleging      that    the    court     improperly          relied    on     a       theory    of\n\nconcealment money laundering, 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i), when\n\nIacaboni pleaded guilty only to promotion money laundering.                              Id. §\n\n1956(a)(1)(A)(i).            The    government        concedes       that       a    variance\n\noccurred,      but    contends        that     it    did    not     affect          Iacaboni’s\n\n\n\n\n                                             -13-\n\fsubstantial rights.11\n\n              Here, the indictment alleged promotion money laundering,\n\nIacaboni pleaded guilty to promotion money laundering, but -- to\n\nthe extent the Landman checks are included in the forfeiture -- the\n\nsentence was based on a concealment money laundering theory.                 See\n\nIacaboni, 221 F. Supp. 2d at 117 (“[T]he court finds that the\n\ndefendant’s purpose in depositing these funds in his general bank\n\naccount was to conceal their illegal nature.          Commingling tainted\n\nfunds with legitimate funds ‘for the purpose of concealing the\n\nnature or source of the tainted funds’ constitutes concealment\n\nmoney      laundering”    (citation   omitted)).    The   district     court’s\n\nforfeiture of the Landman checks on the basis of concealment money\n\nlaundering, a charge that the government conceded at oral argument\n\nwas not included in Count IV of the indictment, effectively altered\n\nthe   terms    of   the   indictment.     This   alteration   is   a   per    se\n\nprejudicial “constructive amendment.” See United States v. Fisher,\n\n3 F.3d 456, 462-63 (1st Cir. 1993)(“A constructive amendment occurs\n\n\n      11\n      The government also argues that the issue was not preserved\non appeal, and should therefore be subject only to plain error\nreview. We do not agree. In his proposed findings of fact and\nconclusions of law submitted prior to sentencing, Iacaboni\ncontended that the government had not charged any form of money\nlaundering on the basis of Landman’s checks. See Def’s. Proposed\nFindings of Fact and Conclusions of Law No. 28. Iacaboni urged the\ndistrict court to find that “[n]othing about these checks suggests\nthat they were involved in a money laundering transaction. Indeed,\nthe government has not even suggested that they were money\nlaundering transactions, as they were not so charged in the\nIndictment.” See Def’s. Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions\nof Law No. 61.\n\n                                      -14-\n\fwhen the charging terms of the indictment are altered, either\n\nliterally or in effect, by the prosecution or court after the grand\n\njury has last passed upon them.” (internal quotation omitted)).\n\nAccordingly, we reverse the district court order to the extent the\n\nLandman checks are included in the forfeiture.12\n\n                        III.   Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court’s\n\norder of forfeiture but reverse and remand to the extent that the\n\nLandman checks are included in the forfeiture.\n\n          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n     12\n      We decline the government’s invitation to affirm on the\nalternative ground, adverted to only in passing in its brief, that\nthe depositing of the checks constituted promotion money\nlaundering. The government has not identified any portion of the\nrecord that would justify such a conclusion by this court or any\nfurther consideration of the issue on remand.\n\n                               -15-\n\f",

He appeals the district court's subsequent forfeiture order, contending that the court erred in its determination that $384,245 should be forfeited. Concluding that the district court's reasoning is sound as to the bulk of the award, we affirm in part, but reverse and remand as to one category of funds included in the forfeiture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From 1995 through March 1998, Iacaboni conducted an illegal sports gambling operation in and around Leominster, Massachusetts. Iacaboni's business included a few different \"offices\" headed by individuals hired to take bets from gamblers over the telephone. Iacaboni also ran a \"football ticket\" business; bettors paid between $1 and $10 per \"ticket,\" a card on which they checked off four or more predictions in dozens of upcoming games.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 2001, a grand jury indicted Iacaboni on charges of conspiracy to conduct an illegal gambling business (Count I), 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371; operating an illegal gambling business (Count II), 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1955; conspiracy to conduct an illegal gambling business involving interstate travel (Count III), 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371; conspiracy to launder money from 1995 to March 1998 (Count IV), 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(h); and money laundering on December 23, 1997 (Count V), 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(a)(1)(A)(i). The indictment also included forfeiture allegations seeking \"any property, real or personal, involved in\" Iacaboni's violations of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 982(a)(1). At his arraignment, Iacaboni entered a plea of not guilty on all charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 26, 2002, Iacaboni changed his plea to guilty on Counts I through IV of the indictment, and the government agreed to dismiss Count V. Iacaboni also pleaded guilty to a criminal information charging him with money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(a)(1)(B)(i) in connection with the December 23, 1997 transaction that had been the subject of Count V.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 2002, the court held a bench trial on the forfeiture allegations. The government presented the testimony of two of Iacaboni's employees, Robert Bolaski and Ryan Gallagher. They described their day-to-day duties, the size of their typical client roster (40 to 50 for Bolaski, and 15 to 20 for Gallagher), and their weekly salaries (ranging from $300 to $350). Bolaski estimated that Iacaboni's business might owe approximately $15,000 to $20,000 to winning bettors during a bad week, and expect to collect $20,000 to $25,000 from losing bettors during a good week. Gallagher testified that his office paid out an average of approximately $10,000 per week to winning bettors over the course of a seventeen-week football season. Both Bolaski and Gallagher testified that the volume of betting varied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Larry Landman, one of Iacaboni's bettors, also testified at trial. He testified that he bet every weekend during football season, and that occasionally when he owed money to Iacaboni, he would send \"personal checks\" made out to the defendant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> He sometimes made the notation \"personal loan\" on the checks, a practice that was his own idea, not one suggested by Iacaboni. Iacaboni deposited Landman's checks into his personal account. The government presented evidence of nineteen checks given to Iacaboni by Landman, only nine of which were relevant to the forfeiture analysis because of the applicable five-year statute of limitations. These nine checks, deposited between May 1996 and December 1996, totaled $7,385.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also heard testimony from Robert Davies, an agent of Iacaboni's, and Tina LeClair, Iacaboni's former girlfriend. These witnesses, along with Bolaski, described the operation of the football ticket business, including how bets were placed and winnings distributed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 2002, Iacaboni was sentenced to ten months in custody, a fine of $30,000, and three years' supervised release. The district court heard argument on the forfeiture allegations soon thereafter. In August 2002, the district court ordered Iacaboni to forfeit $384,245 pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 982(a)(1). This amount included (1) $340,000 in funds paid to winning phone-in bettors over the 1996 and 1997 football seasons; (2) $10,000 in funds paid to winning football ticket bettors; (3) $10,000 representing funds involved in the December 23, 1997 transaction; (4) $7,495 in checks from Landman; (5) $16,150 in salaries; and (6) $600 in phone expenses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The district court declined to order that Iacaboni forfeit his residence in Leominster, a penalty sought by the government.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Iacaboni contends that the district court erred in its determination of the amount to be forfeited because (1) the payouts to winning bettors were integral to the illegal gambling business and therefore could not be considered property involved in money laundering; (2) there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that $340,000 was paid out to phone-in bettors; and (3) the Landman checks were not property involved in money laundering.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Payments to Winning Bettors</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review de novo the district court's determination of what constitutes forfeitable proceeds under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(a)(1)(A)(i). The court found that $350,000, an amount representing payments to winning bettors, should be forfeited.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The statute provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a)(1) Whoever, knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity, conducts or attempts to conduct such a financial transaction which in fact involves the proceeds of specified unlawful activity</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(A)(i) with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">shall be sentenced to a fine of not more than $500,000 or twice the value of the property involved in the transaction, whichever is greater[.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Looking to the language of the statute, we first consider whether the payments to winning bettors constituted financial transactions involving the proceeds of illegal gambling, a specified unlawful activity. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1956(a)(1). The district court concluded that this portion of the statute had been satisfied, noting the breadth of the terms \"financial transaction\" and \"proceeds.\" <i>Iacaboni,</i> 221 F.Supp.2d at 111-12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Iacaboni does not contest his participation in \"financial transactions,\" but he does argue that \"proceeds\" refers to net income of the illegal gambling operation, not payouts, citing <i>United States v. Scialabba,</i> 282 F.3d 475 (7th Cir.2002), <i>cert. denied,</i> 537 U.S. 1071, 123 S.Ct. 671, 154 L.Ed.2d 565 (2002). There, the Seventh Circuit held that money paid to winning players in an illegal video poker scheme could not be considered proceeds, defining proceeds as net profits. We have previously rejected Iacaboni's interpretation of the term \"proceeds\" in the RICO forfeiture context. <i>See United States v. Hurley,</i> 63 F.3d 1, 21 (1st Cir.1995)(quoting legislative history of RICO forfeiture provisions for the proposition that \"the term `proceeds' has been used in lieu of the term `profits' in order to alleviate the unreasonable burden on the government of proving net profits\"). Iacaboni has offered no rationale for abandoning that approach here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Concluding that Iacaboni's financial transactions involved \"proceeds\" within the meaning of &#167; 1956(a)(1), we turn to whether the transactions were intended to promote the gambling operation. Iacaboni asserts that payments to winning bettors cannot be considered \"promotion\" because these payments were an integral part of the illegal gambling business. Defining payouts as promotion, Iacaboni contends, is an impermissible alternative punishment for operating a gambling business. He argues for an interpretation of the statute that would require an additional promotional step beyond the mere operation of the illegal venture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addressing this argument, the district court opined that the payouts were not typical examples of promotion money laundering (such as the \"plowing back\" or reinvestment of criminal proceeds through the payment of business expenses, <i>see</i> B. Frederic Williams, Jr. &amp; Frank D. Whitney, Federal Money Laundering: Crimes and Forfeitures 137-39 (1999)). But the court nevertheless concluded that the transactions fell within the reach of &#167; 1956(a)(1)(A)(i), in part because \"[n]othing makes an illegal gambling operation flourish more than the prompt payment of winners,\" <i>id.</i> at 114 (citing <i>United States v. Febus,</i> 218 F.3d 784, 790 (7th Cir.2000)), and in part because it was not \"fundamentally unfair to view as money laundering the conduct of defendant that took the proceeds of his illegal business and used them to increase the popularity and viability of his criminal operation by paying his winners.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court, and affirm on the grounds set forth in its opinion, as well as the following considerations. Crimes such as the operation of an illegal gambling ring create huge sums of cash, the use or disposition of which can prove problematic for illegal gambling operators who wish to stay beneath the radar of law enforcement agencies. Depositing the funds with a financial institution can trigger currency transaction reporting requirements, <i>see Hurley,</i> 63 F.3d at 12 (citing 31 U.S.C. &#167; 5313), which in turn can bring the depositor the unwanted attention of the Internal Revenue Service or other government agencies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Criminals dealing in large amounts of cash who wish to avoid the risks and practical difficulties of \"putting it in the mattress\" have thus developed strategies to avoid the creation of a paper trail that can lead to apprehension. They frequently \"structure\" their cash deposits so as to avoid reporting requirement triggers, <i>see United States v. Saccoccia,</i> 58 F.3d 754, 762 n. 1 (1st Cir.1995) (describing subdivision of cash into \"smaller, unreportable amounts,\" a process also known as \"smurfing\"); use the cash to purchase valuables, <i>see id.</i> (recounting scheme whereby proceeds from Columbian drug cartel were laundered through purchases of gold); and use the cash to promote, or \"move forward,\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1815 (1993), the unlawful scheme by which the cash was derived or another unlawful scheme, <i>see United States v. London,</i> 66 F.3d 1227, 1242-43 (1st Cir.1995) (upholding money laundering conviction of operator of check-cashing business whose intentional failure to file currency transaction reports benefitted his bookmaking clientele). Recognizing the prevalence of these evasionary strategies, Congress in 1986 enacted &#167; 1956 to outlaw (1) the structuring of financial transactions so as to avoid currency reporting requirements or to conceal the source of the funds, and (2) the promotion of unlawful activity through financial transactions involving the proceeds of a specified unlawful activity (of which running an unlawful gambling operation is one, <i>see United</i> <i>States v. LeBlanc,</i> 24 F.3d 340, 346 (1st Cir.1994)). Thus the statute's two \"prongs.\" <i>See</i> n. 7, above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, Iacaboni misses the point in asserting that defining the payouts as promotion would constitute an impermissible alternative punishment for an act that is an integral component of an unlawful gambling business.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Targeting the payouts reflects the decision of Congress (embodied in &#167; 1956) to proscribe not only certain unlawful cash-generating schemes, but also the means by which they are practically carried out and hidden from investigators. <i>See LeBlanc,</i> 24 F.3d at 346 (\"Congress intended to criminalize a broad array of transactions designed to facilitate numerous federal crimes, including illegal gambling.\"). Such a proscription empowers law enforcement to combat such schemes not only from a direct operational perspective, but also from the more indirect financial angle. Viewed in this light, the district court's decision to forfeit the payouts to winning gamblers is consonant with the purposes for which Congress enacted 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(a)(1)(A)(i).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> We hasten to add that we are only deciding whether the facts of this case come within the term \"promote\" as used in this statute, and not as that term may have been used by Congress elsewhere in federal law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Calculation of Amount of Payments to Winning Phone-In Bettors</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Iacaboni contends that even if the payments to winning bettors are properly characterized as promotion money laundering and thus forfeitable, the district court erred in calculating the amounts paid to winning phone-in bettors. The court found that Gallagher testified credibly that his office paid out an average of approximately $10,000 per week during the seventeen-week football season. The court concluded therefore that approximately $170,000 was paid out during each football season, totaling $340,000 over the course of two years. This calculation was based on Gallagher's office only,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> and did not include bets on the playoffs or the Super Bowl. Likewise, it included only wagers on football games, although the Iacaboni operation also took bets on baseball, hockey and basketball.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's factual findings regarding the amounts paid to winning phone-in bettors are reviewed for clear error. <i>See United States v. 15 Bosworth Street,</i> 236 F.3d 50, 53 (1st Cir.2001)(noting, in civil forfeiture context, that \"the appellate process ought to respect the trial judge's superior feel for the case and his enhanced ability to weigh and evaluate conflicting evidence\" (internal quotation omitted)). The findings were based in part on a credibility determination to which we extend great deference, and in part on commonsense extrapolation. We conclude that the district court's findings were sound in light of the small segment of Iacaboni's business on which they were based. Indeed, the amount ordered forfeited appears to be a reasonable and fair estimate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Landman Checks</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Iacaboni contests the district court's finding that $7,495 in checks Landman paid to Iacaboni were forfeitable, alleging that the court improperly relied on a theory of concealment money laundering, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(a)(1)(B)(i), when Iacaboni pleaded guilty only to promotion money laundering. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1956(a)(1)(A)(i). The government concedes that a variance occurred, but contends that it did not affect Iacaboni's substantial rights.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the indictment alleged promotion money laundering, Iacaboni pleaded guilty to promotion money laundering, but &#8212; to the extent the Landman checks are included in the forfeiture &#8212; the sentence was based on a <i>concealment</i> money laundering theory. <i>See Iacaboni,</i> 221 F.Supp.2d at 117 (\"[T]he court finds that the defendant's purpose in depositing these funds in his general bank account was to conceal their illegal nature.

The district court's forfeiture of the Landman checks on the basis of concealment money laundering, a charge that the government conceded at oral argument was not included in Count IV of the indictment, effectively altered the terms of the indictment.

He appeals the district court's subsequent forfeiture order, contending that the court erred in its determination that $384,245 should be forfeited. Concluding that the district court's reasoning is sound as to the bulk of the award, we affirm in part, but reverse and remand as to one category of funds included in the forfeiture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From 1995 through March 1998, Iacaboni conducted an illegal sports gambling operation in and around Leominster, Massachusetts. Iacaboni's business included a few different \"offices\" headed by individuals hired to take bets from gamblers over the telephone. Iacaboni also ran a \"football ticket\" business; bettors paid between $1 and $10 per \"ticket,\" a card on which they checked off four or more predictions in dozens of upcoming games.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 2001, a grand jury indicted Iacaboni on charges of conspiracy to conduct an illegal gambling business (Count I), 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371; operating an illegal gambling business (Count II), 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1955; conspiracy to conduct an illegal gambling business involving interstate travel (Count III), 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371; conspiracy to launder money from 1995 to March 1998 (Count IV), 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(h); and money laundering on December 23, 1997 (Count V), 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(a)(1)(A)(i). The indictment also included forfeiture allegations seeking \"any property, real or personal, involved in\" Iacaboni's violations of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 982(a)(1). At his arraignment, Iacaboni entered a plea of not guilty on all charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 26, 2002, Iacaboni changed his plea to guilty on Counts I through IV of the indictment, and the government agreed to dismiss Count V. Iacaboni also pleaded guilty to a criminal information charging him with money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(a)(1)(B)(i) in connection with the December 23, 1997 transaction that had been the subject of Count V.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 2002, the court held a bench trial on the forfeiture allegations. The government presented the testimony of two of Iacaboni's employees, Robert Bolaski and Ryan Gallagher. They described their day-to-day duties, the size of their typical client roster (40 to 50 for Bolaski, and 15 to 20 for Gallagher), and their weekly salaries (ranging from $300 to $350). Bolaski estimated that Iacaboni's business might owe approximately $15,000 to $20,000 to winning bettors during a bad week, and expect to collect $20,000 to $25,000 from losing bettors during a good week. Gallagher testified that his office paid out an average of approximately $10,000 per week to winning bettors over the course of a seventeen-week football season. Both Bolaski and Gallagher testified that the volume of betting varied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Larry Landman, one of Iacaboni's bettors, also testified at trial. He testified that he bet every weekend during football season, and that occasionally when he owed money to Iacaboni, he would send \"personal checks\" made out to the defendant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> He sometimes made the notation \"personal loan\" on the checks, a practice that was his own idea, not one suggested by Iacaboni. Iacaboni deposited Landman's checks into his personal account. The government presented evidence of nineteen checks given to Iacaboni by Landman, only nine of which were relevant to the forfeiture analysis because of the applicable five-year statute of limitations. These nine checks, deposited between May 1996 and December 1996, totaled $7,385.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also heard testimony from Robert Davies, an agent of Iacaboni's, and Tina LeClair, Iacaboni's former girlfriend. These witnesses, along with Bolaski, described the operation of the football ticket business, including how bets were placed and winnings distributed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 2002, Iacaboni was sentenced to ten months in custody, a fine of $30,000, and three years' supervised release. The district court heard argument on the forfeiture allegations soon thereafter. In August 2002, the district court ordered Iacaboni to forfeit $384,245 pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 982(a)(1). This amount included (1) $340,000 in funds paid to winning phone-in bettors over the 1996 and 1997 football seasons; (2) $10,000 in funds paid to winning football ticket bettors; (3) $10,000 representing funds involved in the December 23, 1997 transaction; (4) $7,495 in checks from Landman; (5) $16,150 in salaries; and (6) $600 in phone expenses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The district court declined to order that Iacaboni forfeit his residence in Leominster, a penalty sought by the government.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Iacaboni contends that the district court erred in its determination of the amount to be forfeited because (1) the payouts to winning bettors were integral to the illegal gambling business and therefore could not be considered property involved in money laundering; (2) there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that $340,000 was paid out to phone-in bettors; and (3) the Landman checks were not property involved in money laundering.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Payments to Winning Bettors</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review de novo the district court's determination of what constitutes forfeitable proceeds under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(a)(1)(A)(i). The court found that $350,000, an amount representing payments to winning bettors, should be forfeited.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The statute provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a)(1) Whoever, knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity, conducts or attempts to conduct such a financial transaction which in fact involves the proceeds of specified unlawful activity</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(A)(i) with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">shall be sentenced to a fine of not more than $500,000 or twice the value of the property involved in the transaction, whichever is greater[.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Looking to the language of the statute, we first consider whether the payments to winning bettors constituted financial transactions involving the proceeds of illegal gambling, a specified unlawful activity. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1956(a)(1). The district court concluded that this portion of the statute had been satisfied, noting the breadth of the terms \"financial transaction\" and \"proceeds.\" <i>Iacaboni,</i> 221 F.Supp.2d at 111-12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Iacaboni does not contest his participation in \"financial transactions,\" but he does argue that \"proceeds\" refers to net income of the illegal gambling operation, not payouts, citing <i>United States v. Scialabba,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776781\"><a href=\"/opinion/776781/united-states-v-lawrence-scialabba-and-robert-t-cechini/\"><span class=\"volume\">282</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">475</span></a></span> (7th Cir.2002), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1071</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></span> (2002). There, the Seventh Circuit held that money paid to winning players in an illegal video poker scheme could not be considered proceeds, defining proceeds as net profits. We have previously rejected Iacaboni's interpretation of the term \"proceeds\" in the RICO forfeiture context. <i>See United States v. Hurley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"702294\"><a href=\"/opinion/702294/united-states-v-vincent-hurley-united-states-of-america-v-carlo-demarco/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 21 (1st Cir.1995)(quoting legislative history of RICO forfeiture provisions for the proposition that \"the term `proceeds' has been used in lieu of the term `profits' in order to alleviate the unreasonable burden on the government of proving net profits\"). Iacaboni has offered no rationale for abandoning that approach here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Concluding that Iacaboni's financial transactions involved \"proceeds\" within the meaning of &#167; 1956(a)(1), we turn to whether the transactions were intended to promote the gambling operation. Iacaboni asserts that payments to winning bettors cannot be considered \"promotion\" because these payments were an integral part of the illegal gambling business. Defining payouts as promotion, Iacaboni contends, is an impermissible alternative punishment for operating a gambling business. He argues for an interpretation of the statute that would require an additional promotional step beyond the mere operation of the illegal venture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addressing this argument, the district court opined that the payouts were not typical examples of promotion money laundering (such as the \"plowing back\" or reinvestment of criminal proceeds through the payment of business expenses, <i>see</i> B. Frederic Williams, Jr. &amp; Frank D. Whitney, Federal Money Laundering: Crimes and Forfeitures 137-39 (1999)). But the court nevertheless concluded that the transactions fell within the reach of &#167; 1956(a)(1)(A)(i), in part because \"[n]othing makes an illegal gambling operation flourish more than the prompt payment of winners,\" <i>id.</i> at 114 (citing <i>United States v.

Crimes such as the operation of an illegal gambling ring create huge sums of cash, the use or disposition of which can prove problematic for illegal gambling operators who wish to stay beneath the radar of law enforcement agencies. Depositing the funds with a financial institution can trigger currency transaction reporting requirements, <i>see Hurley,</i> 63 F.3d at 12 (citing 31 U.S.C. &#167; 5313), which in turn can bring the depositor the unwanted attention of the Internal Revenue Service or other government agencies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Criminals dealing in large amounts of cash who wish to avoid the risks and practical difficulties of \"putting it in the mattress\" have thus developed strategies to avoid the creation of a paper trail that can lead to apprehension.

Recognizing the prevalence of these evasionary strategies, Congress in 1986 enacted &#167; 1956 to outlaw (1) the structuring of financial transactions so as to avoid currency reporting requirements or to conceal the source of the funds, and (2) the promotion of unlawful activity through financial transactions involving the proceeds of a specified unlawful activity (of which running an unlawful gambling operation is one, <i>see United</i> <i>States v.

Such a proscription empowers law enforcement to combat such schemes not only from a direct operational perspective, but also from the more indirect financial angle. Viewed in this light, the district court's decision to forfeit the payouts to winning gamblers is consonant with the purposes for which Congress enacted 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(a)(1)(A)(i).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> We hasten to add that we are only deciding whether the facts of this case come within the term \"promote\" as used in this statute, and not as that term may have been used by Congress elsewhere in federal law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Calculation of Amount of Payments to Winning Phone-In Bettors</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Iacaboni contends that even if the payments to winning bettors are properly characterized as promotion money laundering and thus forfeitable, the district court erred in calculating the amounts paid to winning phone-in bettors. The court found that Gallagher testified credibly that his office paid out an average of approximately $10,000 per week during the seventeen-week football season. The court concluded therefore that approximately $170,000 was paid out during each football season, totaling $340,000 over the course of two years. This calculation was based on Gallagher's office only,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> and did not include bets on the playoffs or the Super Bowl. Likewise, it included only wagers on football games, although the Iacaboni operation also took bets on baseball, hockey and basketball.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's factual findings regarding the amounts paid to winning phone-in bettors are reviewed for clear error. <i>See United States v. 15 Bosworth Street,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199222\"><a href=\"/opinion/199222/united-states-v-15-bosworth-street/\"><span class=\"volume\">236</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 53 (1st Cir.2001)(noting, in civil forfeiture context, that \"the appellate process ought to respect the trial judge's superior feel for the case and his enhanced ability to weigh and evaluate conflicting evidence\" (internal quotation omitted)). The findings were based in part on a credibility determination to which we extend great deference, and in part on commonsense extrapolation. We conclude that the district court's findings were sound in light of the small segment of Iacaboni's business on which they were based. Indeed, the amount ordered forfeited appears to be a reasonable and fair estimate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Landman Checks</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Iacaboni contests the district court's finding that $7,495 in checks Landman paid to Iacaboni were forfeitable, alleging that the court improperly relied on a theory of concealment money laundering, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(a)(1)(B)(i), when Iacaboni pleaded guilty only to promotion money laundering. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1956(a)(1)(A)(i). The government concedes that a variance occurred, but contends that it did not affect Iacaboni's substantial rights.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the indictment alleged promotion money laundering, Iacaboni pleaded guilty to promotion money laundering, but &#8212; to the extent the Landman checks are included in the forfeiture &#8212; the sentence was based on a <i>concealment</i> money laundering theory. <i>See Iacaboni,</i> 221 F.Supp.2d at 117 (\"[T]he court finds that the defendant's purpose in depositing these funds in his general bank account was to conceal their illegal nature. Commingling tainted funds with legitimate funds `for the purpose of concealing the nature or source of the tainted funds' constitutes concealment money laundering\" (citation omitted)). The district court's forfeiture of the Landman checks on the basis of concealment money laundering, a charge that the government conceded at oral argument was not included in Count IV of the indictment, effectively altered the terms of the indictment. This alteration is a per se prejudicial \"constructive amendment.\" <i>See United States v.
