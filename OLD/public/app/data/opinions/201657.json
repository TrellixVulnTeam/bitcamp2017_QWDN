We have therefore substituted\nAttorney General Gonzáles for John Ashcroft as the respondent. See\nFed. R. Civ. P. 25(d)(1); Fed. R. App. P. 43(c)(2).\n\f          Per Curiam.      Petitioner Maksim Isufaj, a native and\n\ncitizen of Albania, petitions for review of a decision of the Board\n\nof Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirming the denial by an Immigration\n\nJudge (IJ) of his application for political asylum.\n\n          On July 6, 2001, traveling under a counterfeit Greek\n\npassport, Isufaj first set foot in the United States in the Miami\n\nairport, ostensibly as a \"transit without visa\" en route from\n\nBrazil to Canada, but with the real purpose of seeking political\n\nasylum in the United States, where Isufaj has relatives.          At the\n\nairport, he presented himself to immigration officers and requested\n\nasylum.\n\n          On July 11, 2001, Isufaj was given a \"credible fear\"\n\ninterview by an asylum officer.       He stated that, after living and\n\nintermittently working in Greece for four years, he had returned to\n\nAlbania for about a month to participate in the June 24, 2001\n\nparliamentary   election   as   a   local   election   monitor   for   the\n\nopposition Democratic Party.         Shortly after the polls closed,\n\nunknown civilians, presumably associated with the ruling Socialist\n\nParty, had attempted to steal the ballot box and pointed a gun to\n\nhis head when he refused to let them take it.      Later that day, his\n\ncousin warned him that he should not return home, ever, because\n\npeople were looking for him and would kill him.         Fearing for his\n\nlife, Isufaj explained, he fled the country.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f                At the conclusion of the interview, Isufaj was given a\n\nNotice to Appear for removal proceedings, and was released from\n\ndetention pending such proceedings. Those proceedings materialized\n\non April 23, 2002, at which time Isufaj admitted the immigration\n\ncharges and conceded removability.               He applied for political\n\nasylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention\n\nAgainst Torture.2\n\n                On December 31, 2002, the IJ held an evidentiary hearing.\n\nIsufaj was the sole witness.          The government's cross-examination\n\nand   the   IJ's     questions   uncovered     numerous     inconsistencies   in\n\nIsufaj's story, relating to both broad themes (such as why he came\n\nto the United States) and details (such as his United States\n\naddress, when he joined the Albanian Democratic Party, and whether\n\nhe    had   a    valid   Albanian   passport    in   July    2001).   Isufaj's\n\nexplanation for many of these inconsistencies was that he \"must've\n\nmade many mistakes on [his] statement\" and the like.\n\n                The IJ concluded -- based on her assessment of Isufaj's\n\ntestimony viewed against the background of documentary exhibits\n\nregarding human rights and political conditions in Albania -- that\n\nIsufaj was \"not a credible witness,\" that he had \"specifically lied\n\n\n\n       2\n      The Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or\nDegrading Treatment or Punishment, Dec. 10, 1984, 1465 U.N.T.S. 85,\nwas implemented in the United States by the Foreign Affairs Reform\nand Restructuring Act of 1998, Pub. L. No. 105-277, § 2242, 112\nStat. 2681-761 (codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1231), and 8 C.F.R. §\n208.16(c).\n\n                                      -3-\n\fto the Immigration Officer,\" and that the basic premise of his\n\nstory -- that he had returned to Albania to be an election monitor\n\n-- was \"not credible.\"          The IJ concluded that Isufaj was \"so\n\n[economically] desperate . . . that he has lied to me, [and] to the\n\nofficer when he first came to the United States.            I find that the\n\nstory is just simply fabricated.\"\n\n            The   IJ   denied    Isufaj's    applications     for     asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against\n\nTorture.    She further found that Isufaj had knowingly filed a\n\nfrivolous   application    for    asylum    after   being   warned    of   the\n\nconsequences for doing so, namely, permanent ineligibility to enter\n\nthe United States.      See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(d)(6).          In a brief per\n\ncuriam opinion, the BIA affirmed the denial of all three forms of\n\nrelief but vacated the finding that Isufaj had knowingly filed a\n\nfrivolous application.      On appeal, Isufaj challenges only the\n\ndenial of asylum.\n\n            An asylum applicant \"may qualify as a refugee either\n\nbecause he or she has suffered past persecution or because he or\n\nshe has a well-founded fear of future persecution.\"                  8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1208.13(b).     In either case, the applicant has the burden of\n\nproof. Id. § 1208.13(a); see also Khalil v. Ashcroft, 337 F.3d 50,\n\n55 (1st Cir. 2003) (enumerating requirements for proving past\n\npersecution or well-founded fear of persecution).           \"Determinations\n\nof eligibility for asylum or withholding deportation are conclusive\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f'if supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on\n\nthe record considered as a whole.'\"          Albathani v. INS, 318 F.3d\n\n365, 372 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S.\n\n478, 481 (1992)).     \"[T]he administrative findings of fact are\n\nconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to\n\nconclude to the contrary.\"          8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B).         This\n\ndeferential standard means that \"[t]o reverse the BIA finding we\n\nmust find that the evidence not only supports that conclusion, but\n\ncompels it.\"    Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. at 481 n.1.\n\n           While Isufaj's story could, in theory, be consistent with\n\nthe evidence, \"[m]erely identifying alternative findings that could\n\nbe supported by substantial evidence is insufficient to supplant\n\nthe [IJ's] findings.\"        Albathani, 318 F.3d at 372.          The IJ\n\nconcluded that the entire story on which Isufaj based his claim was\n\n\"just simply fabricated.\"       Nothing that we have found in the\n\nhearing transcript, or the documentary evidence concerning crime,\n\npolitics, and human rights in Albania, undermines the IJ's adverse\n\ncredibility finding, and therefore we cannot say that the evidence\n\ncompels   the   conclusion   that   Isufaj    demonstrated   either   past\n\npersecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution.\n\n           The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f",
