José Antonio Fusté, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                        Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                       Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n                 and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Ramon M. Gonzalez, by appointment of the court, was on brief\nfor appellant.\n     Rosa Emilia Rodriguez-Velez, United States Attorney, with whom\nNelson Pérez-Sosa and Mariana E. Bauzá-Almonte, Assistant United\nStates Attorneys, were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           May 12, 2008\n\f              Per Curiam.     Jose Marcano pleaded guilty to one count of\n\naiding and abetting the receipt and possession of an illegally\n\nmodified firearm in violation of 26 U.S.C. §§ 5822 and 5845.                     On\n\nAugust 29, 2002, the district court sentenced Marcano to a term of\n\nthirty-three months' imprisonment, to be followed by three years of\n\nsupervised release.          On October 6, 2006, following revocation\n\nproceedings,     the      district   court      revoked     Marcano's   supervised\n\nrelease and sentenced him to eighteen months' imprisonment to be\n\nfollowed by one year of supervised release, during the first 180\n\ndays of which he was to be subject to limited home confinement.\n\nMarcano appeals, contesting the legality of his sentence.\n\n              The conditions which a district court may attach to\n\nsupervised release are spelled out by 18 U.S.C. § 3583(d). Section\n\n§ 3583(d), inter alia, permits a district court to prescribe \"any\n\ncondition     that   is    set   forth   as    a   discretionary    condition    of\n\nprobation in section 3563(b)(1) through (b)(10) and b(12) through\n\n(b)(20).\"     Here, the district court chose to impose a condition of\n\nrelease requiring Marcano to submit to home confinement pursuant to\n\n§ 3563(b)(19).\n\n              Marcano contends that the plain language of § 3563(b)(19)\n\nforbids its application where any term of incarceration is imposed.\n\nSee 18 U.S.C. § 3563(b)(19).          Because he raises this issue for the\n\nfirst time on appeal, we review only for plain error.                   See United\n\nStates   v.    Sanchez-Berrios,      424       F.3d   65,   81   (1st   Cir.   2005)\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\f(applying    plain    error     doctrine     in     reviewing     conditions      of\n\nsupervised release).\n\n            Section 3563(b)(19) provides that \"a condition under this\n\nparagraph may be imposed only as an alternative to incarceration.\"\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3563(b)(19) (emphasis added).                  Thus, Marcano reasons\n\nthat the district court erred by imposing home confinement during\n\nsupervised    release      to   follow     his     eighteen-month      period    of\n\nincarceration. The Government, in essence, responds that Marcano's\n\ninterpretation is flawed because it ignores the effect of § 3583,\n\nwhich    deals     exclusively     with     supervised       release    following\n\nimprisonment,      upon    §    3563(b)(19).          Because     §    3583(d)(1)\n\nspecifically authorizes the condition of home confinement set forth\n\nby   §   3563(b)(19),     and   supervised       release    necessarily   follows\n\nincarceration, the Government argues that lower courts may order\n\nhome confinement beyond the maximum period of incarceration.\n\n            Even    assuming    arguendo     that    Congress     intended      home\n\nconfinement to be a substitute for incarceration, it does not\n\nfollow that Marcano's sentence is illegal.                 As Marcano concedes,\n\nthe district court was authorized to impose a maximum sentence of\n\nup to two years' imprisonment.           18 U.S.C. § 3583(e)(3).        The total\n\nperiod of imprisonment, eighteen months, plus the ensuing period of\n\nhome confinement, 180 days, does not exceed the statutory maximum\n\nterm of imprisonment of two years. Thus, to afford Marcano relief,\n\nwe would have to conclude that the imposition of any period of\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fincarceration pursuant to § 3583(e)(3) necessarily precludes any\n\nhome confinement during the ensuing period of supervised release.\n\nThe statutory text certainly surely does not compel such a reading,\n\nand Marcano cites to no authority adopting this approach.\n\n           Indeed, in United States v. Ferguson, 369 F.3d 847 (5th\n\nCir. 2004), when faced with a nearly identical claim, the Fifth\n\nCircuit determined that \"a court [may] not impose both a term of\n\nincarceration     (upon    revocation        of   supervised   release)   and\n\nsubsequent home detention during a reimposed term of supervised\n\nrelease   that,   when     combined,    exceeds     the   allowable   maximum\n\nincarceration term.\" Id. at 851; accord United States v. Leaphart,\n\n98 F.3d 41, 43 (2d Cir. 1996) (following similar approach under\n\nsentencing guidelines); see also United States v. Roy, 506 F.3d 28,\n\n31 (1st Cir. 2007) (holding that district court's failure to count\n\ntime spent during community confinement was not plain error).\n\nWithout   explicitly      reaching   the     issue,   the   Fifth   Circuit's\n\nreasoning in Ferguson strongly implies that a court may combine\n\nincarceration and home confinement under § 3563(b)(19) provided\n\nthat the total period of incarceration plus home confinement during\n\nsupervised release does not exceed the statutory maximum that the\n\ndefendant may be incarcerated.         369 F.3d at 850-52.\n\n           In sum, Marcano has made a colorable argument that the\n\ndistrict court could not have imposed a period of incarceration and\n\nsupervised release involving home confinement in excess of two\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fyears, the statutory maximum.    It did not do so.   Marcano's real\n\nargument, that a district court may not impose any period of home\n\ndetention following incarceration is tenuous at best, and he fails\n\nto cite any applicable precedent.      That which exists points the\n\nother way.   See id.   At the every least, any error was not plain.\n\nSee United States v. Caraballo-Rodriguez, 480 F.3d 62, 70 (1st Cir.\n\n2007) (holding that plain error cannot be found in case law absent\n\nclear and binding precedent).     Accordingly, we reject Marcano's\n\nchallenge to his sentence.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f",
