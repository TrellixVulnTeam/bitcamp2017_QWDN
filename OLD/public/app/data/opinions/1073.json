Patti B. Saris, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                         Lynch, Chief Judge,\n                Torruella and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Mark E. Howard, with whom Kacavas Ramsdell & Howard, PLLC, was\non brief for appellant.\n     Robert E. Richardson, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n\n                            April 1, 2010\n\f             TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.   Trevor Charlton (\"Charlton\"),\n\nan African-American, was convicted by a jury of one count of being\n\na felon in possession of a firearm,1 in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 922(g)(1).2     The district court enhanced Charlton's sentence\n\npursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"the ACCA\"), 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 924(e).3\n\n\n\n\n1\n    Specifically, the grand jury charged that, \"[o]n or about\nJuly 25, 2004, in Brockton in the District of Massachusetts, . . .\nCharlton . . . [,] having previously been convicted in a court of\na crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,\ndid knowingly possess, in and affecting commerce, a firearm, to\nwit, a Star, Model 30M, 9mm semi[-]automatic pistol, bearing serial\nnumber 1878329.\"\n2\n    18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) provides:\n\n      It shall be unlawful for any person who has been\n      convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by\n      imprisonment for a term exceeding one year . . . to ship\n      or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or\n      possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or\n      ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which\n      has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign\n      commerce.\n3\n    18 U.S.C. § 924(e) provides, in part:\n\n      In the case of a person who violates section 922(g) of\n      this title and has three previous convictions by any\n      court referred to in section 922(g)(1) of this title for\n      a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both,\n      committed on occasions different from one another, such\n      person shall be fined under this title and imprisoned not\n      less than fifteen years, and, notwithstanding any other\n      provision of law, the court shall not suspend the\n      sentence of, or grant a probationary sentence to, such\n      person with respect to the conviction under section\n      922(g).\n\n                                  -2-\n\f             On appeal, Charlton makes two claims.             First, Charlton\n\ncontends that the empanelment of the jury that convicted him was\n\ntainted by racial discrimination in violation of the Constitution\n\nand Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986).                  Second, Charlton\n\nargues that the district court's imposition of the ACCA enhancement\n\nviolated his Constitutional rights because the government did not\n\nplead or prove beyond a reasonable doubt the requisite predicate\n\nconvictions, nor did Charlton admit those convictions.                    Finding\n\nthat   the    district     court   committed   no    error   in    granting   the\n\ngovernment's peremptory strike at issue in this case, we affirm\n\nCharlton's conviction.        Furthermore, finding that we are bound by\n\nthe United States Supreme Court ruling in Almendárez-Torres v.\n\nUnited States, 523 U.S. 224, 226-27 (1998), and our own precedent\n\nin United States v. Richards, 456 F.3d 260, 262 (1st Cir. 2006),\n\ncert. denied, 550 U.S. 905 (2007), we affirm Charlton's sentence.\n\n                      I.   Facts and Procedural History\n\nA.    Incident (2004) and Indictment (2004)\n\n             As we observed in 2007, when this case was first before\n\nus,    the   events    leading     to   Charlton's    arrest      are   generally\n\nundisputed, and their substance is not at issue on this appeal\n\neither.      We thus will present these events even more briefly than\n\nwe did in our prior opinion in this matter.             See United States v.\n\nCharlton, 502 F.3d 1, 2-4 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f           During the evening of July 25, 2004, while investigating\n\na shooting, police in Brockton, Massachusetts found a loaded\n\nfirearm wrapped in a white shirt on a porch near where Charlton was\n\nstanding with four other men.         Later that night, after first\n\noffering various denials, Charlton admitted to the police that he\n\npossessed the firearm, owned the white shirt, and had recently\n\nstabbed a man.\n\n           On September 29, 2004, a grand jury sitting in Boston,\n\nMassachusetts, returned a one-count indictment against Charlton,\n\ncharging him with being a felon in possession of a firearm, in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).\n\nB.  First Trial (2006) and Charlton's Denied Motion to Dismiss\n  (2006)\n\n           On March 13, 2006, Charlton's first trial began.         Seven\n\ndays   later,   on   the   government's   motion   and   over   Charlton's\n\nobjection, the district court declared a mistrial after the jury\n\nrepeatedly declared it was deadlocked.\n\n           On May 23, 2006, Charlton filed a motion to dismiss the\n\nindictment against him on the ground that \"further prosecution\n\nwould violate the Double Jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment to\n\nthe United States Constitution.\"         On June 12, 2006, the district\n\ncourt denied Charlton's motion.      United States v. Charlton, 2006\n\nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 97012, at *14 (D. Mass., June 12, 2006).              On\n\nAugust 10, 2007, we affirmed.      Charlton, 502 F.3d at 6.\n\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fC.   Second Trial -- Jury Selection (2007)\n\n              On December 3, 2007, Charlton's second trial began, and\n\njury selection commenced.         Because this was a non-capital felony\n\ncase,   the    government     possessed      six   peremptory       challenges   to\n\nprospective jurors and Charlton had ten.                 See Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n24(b)(2).          Each side also possessed one additional peremptory\n\nchallenge for the two prospective alternate jurors.                   See Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 24(c)(4)(A).\n\n              The district court qualified the venire, which consisted\n\nof fifty-five potential jurors.              The district court and defense\n\ncounsel argued about the precise number of African-Americans in the\n\njury pool, which defense counsel stated was seven and the district\n\ncourt at one point estimated was twelve.4\n\n              1.    Peremptory Challenges -- Round One\n\n              The district court proceeded by seating the first twelve\n\npotential jurors, which the defense noted included two African-\n\nAmericans.      The government then exercised three of its peremptory\n\nchallenges,        striking   Juror   No.    23,   one   of   the    two   African-\n\nAmericans.         Next, the defense exercised five of its peremptory\n\nchallenges, after which the defense objected to the government's\n\nperemptory challenge of Juror No. 23, stating: \"she's one of the\n\n\n\n4\n   The district court alternated between saying that its estimate\nof the number of African-Americans in the jury pool \"doesn't even\ncount the Chinese guy and the people with Hispanic surnames\" and\n\"included people with Hispanic and Chinese names.\"\n\n                                       -5-\n\ftwo black jurors seated in the jury, and I think one of the few\n\nblack jurors in the jury pool.\"           The government attorney, when\n\nasked by the district court if he \"want[ed] to give a reason for\n\nthe record,\" responded: \"It has nothing to do with the race, just\n\nshe's an attorney, and I do not want an attorney on the jury.\"           The\n\ndistrict court accepted this explanation and excused Juror No. 23.\n\n          2.    Peremptory Challenges -- Round Two\n\n          The   district   court   then    seated    eight   new   potential\n\njurors, including one African-American. The defense then exercised\n\ntwo of its five remaining peremptory challenges.             The government\n\nfollowed by exercising one of its three remaining peremptory\n\nchallenges, striking Juror No. 37, the newly called African-\n\nAmerican. The defense again objected, stating: \"This is the second\n\nAfrican-American that's being challenged.           Our client is entitled\n\nto a fair jury.    If she's off, there will be one African-American\n\non the jury, and I'm pressing that.\"       The government, when asked by\n\nthe district court why he was striking the prospective juror,\n\nresponded:\n\n          [S]he's a member of the clergy.        It has\n          nothing to do with race . . . . Whether she\n          was black, white, Hispanic, Asian, male or\n          female, I'd be challenging her because I think\n          members of the clergy tend to be more\n          sympathetic towards people and less likely to\n          judge them, and I note for the record the\n          first two that I challenged last time happened\n          to be white males.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fThe district court accepted this explanation, stating: \"I do know\n\nthat, typically speaking, prosecutors challenge clergy.     I mean,\n\nthat's the way they do it, so I'm not going to call this a black\n\nchallenge.\"\n\n             After then determining that there was a maximum of two\n\nAfrican-Americans in the remaining jury pool,5 the district court,\n\nreferring to one of those prospective jurors, asked the government:\n\n\"She is African-American, and I'm not striking three, so will you\n\nwithdraw [your peremptory challenge]?\"     The government agreed to\n\nwithdraw its peremptory challenge against Juror No. 37.\n\n\n\n\n5\n   It is unclear whether, at this point, there was one African-\nAmerican remaining in the jury pool, as the defense claims, or two,\nas the district court and the government seemed to suggest. The\nrelevant portion of the transcript is as follows:\n\n     THE COURT: On the other hand, there are two [African-\n     Americans] out there in the pool, at least right now,\n     that I would identify that way . . . .\n\n     . . .\n\n     MR. RICHARDSON: -- before we get to it, who else are we\n     calling African-American that's still out there?\n\n     THE COURT:    It looks like there are two.\n\n     MS. BYRNE:    One of them is his father.\n\n     THE COURT:    No.   There's one.\n\n     . . .\n\n     MR. RICHARDSON: I'm just trying to figure out who they\n     are because if one of them is being counted as African-\n     American and one has a son serving in prison --\n\n                                  -7-\n\f            3.    Peremptory Challenges -- Rounds Three Through Six\n\n            In the third round, the district court seated two new\n\npotential jurors, one of which the defense struck.          In the fourth\n\nround, the district court seated one new potential juror, which the\n\ndefense struck.         At this point, the defense had one remaining\n\nperemptory challenge and, because it had withdrawn its previous\n\nperemptory challenge, the government had three.                 In the fifth\n\nround, the district court seated one new potential juror, which the\n\ndefense struck, exhausting its peremptory challenges.\n\n            In the sixth round, the district court seated one new\n\npotential juror, Juror No. 43, an African-American. The government\n\nexercised   one    of    its   three   remaining   peremptory    challenges,\n\nstriking Juror No. 43.         The government, without prompting from the\n\ndistrict court, provided the following explanation, to which the\n\ndefense did not object:\n\n            Your Honor, this is a juror who indicated that\n            she's got a son who went to prison for\n            possession of a firearm. Therefore I'm going\n            to exercise a peremptory as to her.      And I\n            just do want to make a record that I\n            understand the Court's position, but for\n            whatever it's worth, I do think it's unfair\n            that the government is precluded, for reasons\n            that have absolutely nothing to do with race,\n            from challenging people that under any other\n            circumstance would be unremarkable anyway.\n            That's why I'm challenging this juror.\n\nAt this point, the defense had no remaining peremptory challenges\n\nand the government had two.\n\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\f             4.   Peremptory Challenges -- Final Rounds\n\n             The district court then seated the final juror, after\n\nwhich the district court called the first two candidates for the\n\nalternate slots.        The government exercised its sole peremptory\n\nchallenge for the two prospective alternate jurors, striking Juror\n\nNo. 47, who was not African-American.              The government, without\n\nprompting     from    the   district    court,    provided    the     following\n\nexplanation, to which the defense did not object: \"This is the\n\nother individual who indicated in this case [that] a[] cousin[,] I\n\nbelieve, is in jail for possession [of a firearm].\"                 Afterwards,\n\nthe district court seated one new potential alternative juror, to\n\nwhich neither party objected.\n\n             Of the twelve jurors who were ultimately empaneled, two\n\n-- one of the first twelve prospective jurors to be called from the\n\njury pool and Juror No. 37 -- were African-American.\n\nD.    Second Trial -- Stipulation (2007), Conviction (2007),\n      Sentencing (2008), and Appeal (2008)\n\n             At trial, the parties stipulated to the fact that, prior\n\nto July 25, 2004, Charlton was convicted of a crime punishable by\n\nimprisonment for a term exceeding one year.                  The jury trial\n\nconcluded after seven days on December 10, 2007, resulting in the\n\nconviction of Charlton.\n\n             A presentence investigation report (\"PSI report\"), dated\n\nMay    6,   2008,    documented   Charlton's      prior    criminal   history,\n\nincluding     three    felony   convictions      under    Massachusetts   law.\n\n                                       -9-\n\fConcluding that these convictions subsumed either a violent felony\n\nor an applicable serious drug offense committed on occasions\n\ndifferent from one another, the probation officer who prepared the\n\nPSI report recommended that Charlton be sentenced as an armed\n\ncareer criminal -- a classification that would trigger a fifteen-\n\nyear   minimum     sentence.      18    U.S.C.     §   924(e).     Absent    that\n\nclassification, Charlton's total offense level and prior criminal\n\nhistory would have placed him in a lower guidelines sentencing\n\nrange and, therefore, probably would have yielded a lesser sentence\n\nthan the district court imposed on him.                 On June 9, 2008, the\n\ndistrict court, observing that Charlton \"had quite a few prior\n\nconvictions,\" sentenced Charlton to a term of imprisonment of 204\n\nmonths, sixty months of supervised release, and a $100 special\n\nassessment.\n\n           Judgment was entered on June 11, 2008.              Five days later,\n\nCharlton filed his timely notice of appeal.                 Charlton challenges\n\nboth the peremptory challenges the government exercised in the\n\nprocess of jury empanelment and the imposition of the ACCA.\n\n                                II.    Discussion\n\nA.   Batson Challenge\n\n           On appeal, Charlton argues that empanelment of the jury\n\nthat   convicted    him   was   tainted       by   racial   discrimination   and\n\ntherefore violated his rights to equal protection of the law under\n\nthe Fifth Amendment and Batson, 476 U.S. 79 (1986).                    Charlton\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\fcontends that the government's exercise of peremptory challenges\n\n\"was heavily weighted to exclude African-Americans from the jury.\"\n\nCharlton    concedes   that    the   government      provided   race-neutral\n\nexplanations for its peremptory challenges.            He argues, however,\n\nthat    \"those   explanations    appear     pretextual.\"        Consequently,\n\nCharlton states, his conviction must be reversed and the matter\n\nremanded for a new trial.        As discussed below, we find that the\n\ndistrict court committed no error in accepting the explanations for\n\nthe peremptory challenges the government exercised at trial.\n\n            1.   Background and Framework\n\n            The Supreme Court has observed that \"a defendant has no\n\nright to a petit jury composed in whole or in part of persons of\n\nhis own race . . . but the defendant does have the right to be\n\ntried by a jury whose members are selected pursuant to non-\n\ndiscriminatory criteria.\"         Batson, 476 U.S. at 85-86 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted) (citing Strauder v. West Virginia, 100\n\nU.S. 303, 305 (1880); Martin v. Texas, 200 U.S. 316, 321 (1906); Ex\n\nparte Virginia, 100 U.S. 339, 345 (1880)).           As we have previously\n\nobserved, in the 1986 case of Batson, the Supreme Court \"held that\n\nthe    defendant's   equal    protection    rights   under   the   Fourteenth\n\nAmendment were violated where jury selection at his trial had been\n\naffected by invidious racial discrimination.\"              United States v.\n\nGirouard, 521 F.3d 110, 112 (1st Cir. 2008); see also Batson, 476\n\nU.S. at 89 (\"[T]he component of the jury selection process at issue\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fhere, the State's privilege to strike individual jurors through\n\nperemptory challenges, is subject to the commands of the Equal\n\nProtection Clause. Although a prosecutor ordinarily is entitled to\n\nexercise permitted peremptory challenges for any reason at all, as\n\nlong as that reason is related to his view concerning the outcome\n\nof the case to be tried, the Equal Protection Clause forbids the\n\nprosecutor to challenge potential jurors solely on account of their\n\nrace or on the assumption that black jurors as a group will be\n\nunable impartially to consider the State's case against a black\n\ndefendant.\") (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).\n\n\"Batson applies to proceedings in federal courts under the Fifth\n\nAmendment's Due Process Clause.\"       Girouard, 521 F.3d at 112 n.1.\n\n          As   we   have   also   previously   observed,   \"[t]he   Batson\n\nframework [for challenging jury composition] requires three steps.\"\n\nId. at 113; see also Snyder v. Louisiana, 552 U.S. 472, 476 (2008).\n\nWe have articulated those steps as follows:\n\n          First, the defendant must make a prima facie\n          showing of discrimination in the prosecutor's\n          launching of the strike.     If the defendant\n          fulfills this requirement by establishing,\n          say, a prima facie case of a racially driven\n          impetus, then the prosecutor must proffer a\n          race-neutral explanation for having challenged\n          the juror.

Standard / Scope of Review\n\n          A preserved Batson claim is one in which contemporaneous\n\nobjection was raised at trial; an unpreserved Batson claim is one\n\nin which no such objection was raised at trial.

Analysis\n\n          We consider below both the proper standard / scope of\n\nreview to employ in this matter, as well as Charlton's specific\n\nBatson challenge.\n\n                    a.    Standard / Scope of Review\n\n          Charlton       contends   that    we   should   review   his   Batson\n\nchallenge to the striking of Juror No. 23 for clear error.                 The\n\ngovernment suggests, rather, that we should review Charlton's\n\nchallenge for plain error. The government supports its argument by\n\nobserving that Charlton did not renew his challenge when the\n\npurported purposeful discrimination became apparent: after the\n\ngovernment withdrew its strike of Juror No. 37,6 and then exercised\n\na peremptory challenge against Juror No. 43.              We need not take a\n\nposition on this matter, as we find that the district court\n\ncommitted no error -- clear or plain -- in denying Charlton's\n\nBatson challenge.\n\n\n6\n   In its appellate brief, the government refers to \"juror number\n23\" as the prospective juror against which the government withdrew\na peremptory challenge.    Appellee's Br. at 18.   However, it is\nclear that the government meant Juror No. 37.\n\n                                     -15-\n\f                  b.   Charlton's Specific Batson Challenge\n\n           Charlton focuses his Batson claim on the government's\n\nexercise of a peremptory challenge against Juror No. 23. At trial,\n\nCharlton objected to the striking of Juror No. 23 on Batson\n\ngrounds.   As discussed below, Charlton has relied entirely on the\n\nnumber of prosecution strikes against African-Americans.      As we\n\nhave previously held, \"[i]t is at least questionable whether this\n\nevidence is adequate to surpass the prima facie hurdle.\"      Aspen,\n\n480 F.3d at 577 (citing United States v. Esparsen, 930 F.2d 1461,\n\n1467 (10th Cir. 1991) (\"By itself, the number of challenges used\n\nagainst members of a particular [group] is not sufficient to\n\nestablish . . . a prima facie case.\")) (alteration in original).\n\nBut even assuming that Charlton could establish a prima facie case,\n\nit is clear that he cannot ultimately establish a Batson violation.\n\n           Charlton concedes in his appellate brief that the reason\n\nthe government offered at trial -- that Juror No. 23 is \"an\n\nattorney, and I do not want an attorney on the jury\" -- \"is a\n\nsufficient race-neutral explanation for the challenge and, standing\n\nalone, would vitiate his argument.\"    Charlton contends, however,\n\nthat the totality of the circumstances indicates that \"a purpose to\n\neliminate or minimize an African-American presence on the jury can\n\nbe gleaned, and accordingly Charlton's rights were violated.\"\n\n           To support his totality-of-the-circumstances argument,\n\nCharlton points to several developments throughout the process of\n\n\n                                -16-\n\fvoir    dire.        First,   Charlton     emphasizes    that    the   government\n\nexercised \"only one\" peremptory challenge in the second round in\n\nwhich the district court called prospective jurors when it struck\n\nJuror No. 37, the sole newly called African-American.                       Second,\n\nCharlton points to the fact that the jury that was ultimately\n\nempaneled included two African-Americans, \"one of whom[, Juror No.\n\n37,] was seated only because the prosecutor withdrew his peremptory\n\nchallenge in the face of a Batson challenge.\"                  Finally, Charlton\n\nnotes that the government attempted to exercise three, or fifty\n\npercent, of its six peremptory challenges on African-Americans:\n\nJuror No. 23, Juror No. 37, and Juror No. 43.                  Charlton contends\n\nthat, although the government withdrew its peremptory challenge\n\nagainst      Juror   No.   37,     \"the   government's   use    of   half   of    its\n\nchallenges to rid, or attempt to rid[,] the jury of three (3) of\n\nthe four (4) African-Americans who were seated casts a pall over\n\nthe selection process that amounts to discrimination and undercuts\n\nthe prosecutor's stated reason for challenging Juror No. 23.\"\n\n                              i.    Relevant Numeric Evidence\n\n              Charlton's argument is unavailing given our consultation\n\nof all of the circumstances that bear upon the issue of racial\n\nanimosity. Although on appeal Charlton focuses his Batson claim on\n\nthe government's exercise of a peremptory challenge against Juror\n\nNo.    23,   our     totality-of-the-circumstances        analysis     will      also\n\n\n\n\n                                          -17-\n\fevaluate the government's treatment of other prospective jurors.\n\nWe begin by considering the relevant numeric evidence.\n\n            First, Charlton correctly notes that fifty percent of the\n\ngovernment's strikes were directed against members of a particular\n\ngroup, African-Americans. Second, if we take the most conservative\n\nestimate of African-Americans in the jury pool, seven, these\n\nstrikes resulted in three out of seven, or forty-three percent, of\n\na particular group, African-Americans, being removed from the\n\nvenire.   Since only one of these strikes -- against Juror No. 23 --\n\nis directly challenged on appeal, the percentage of a particular\n\ngroup, African-Americans, being removed from the venire by the\n\nchallenged strike is one out of seven, or fourteen percent.\n\n            Third,   if   we    compare    the   percentage    of    a   group's\n\nrepresentation in the venire to its representation on the jury, we\n\nfind the two percentages to be similar.                Again adopting the\n\nconservative estimate of African-Americans in the jury pool, we\n\nfind that African-Americans comprised seven out of fifty-five, or\n\nthirteen percent, of the venire, and they comprised two out of\n\ntwelve, or seventeen percent, of the jury that was ultimately\n\nempaneled.    The proportion of African-Americans on the empaneled\n\njury was thus actually slightly higher than in the venire.\n\n            In submitting this Batson claim concerning Juror No. 23,\n\nCharlton appeals to \"just numbers alone,\" precisely what we have\n\ncautioned    against.     See   Girouard,    521   F.3d   at   116   (citation\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\fomitted).     The   government's      use    of    half   of   its     statutorily\n\npermitted peremptory challenges to rid, or attempt to rid, the jury\n\nof three of the four African-Americans who were seated does not\n\nnecessarily     amount     to    racial    discrimination        and    does   not\n\nnecessarily undercut the government's stated reason for challenging\n\nJuror No. 23.\n\n                           ii.    Relevant Non-Numeric Evidence\n\n            This finding is further supported by the relevant non-\n\nnumeric evidence.    First, the government did not ask any questions\n\nor make any statements during voir dire that suggested it was\n\noperating with racial animosity towards African-Americans.\n\n            Second, by the end of voir dire for the prospective\n\njurors, the government had two unused peremptory challenges through\n\nwhich it could have eliminated more members of the allegedly\n\ntargeted group of African-Americans.               One African-American was\n\nseated in the first round of voir dire and the government did not\n\nstrike or attempt to strike that person at any point during voir\n\ndire.   As other circuits have found, this circumstance suggests\n\nthat the government was not exercising its peremptory challenges in\n\na racially discriminatory manner.           See, e.g., King v. Moore, 196\n\nF.3d 1327, 1335 (11th Cir. 1999) (rejecting a prospective African-\n\nAmerican juror \"after accepting another black venireperson . . .\n\n[indicates]   not   only    was    there    no    pattern   of   discriminatory\n\nstrikes, there was a sort of 'antipattern'\"); United States v.\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\fMixon, 977 F.2d 921, 923 (5th Cir. 1992) (in a situation in which\n\n\"[t]he government used five out of its six challenges against\n\nblacks[, t]he one black accepted by the government weakens the\n\nargument that the government was accepting jurors solely on a\n\nracial basis\").\n\n           Third, the government offered apparent non-discriminatory\n\nreasons for striking potential jurors based on their voir dire\n\nanswers.   The defense concedes on appeal that the explanations the\n\ngovernment    provided     were   \"race-neutral.\"    The   district   court\n\naccepted each explanation, either implicitly, by not soliciting an\n\nexplanation    and   not    rejecting   the   peremptory   challenge,    or\n\nexplicitly, by soliciting an explanation and then not rejecting the\n\nperemptory challenge. See Girouard, 521 F.3d at 115 (where defense\n\ncounsel objected on religious grounds to a peremptory challenge and\n\nthe district court refused to ask the prosecutor for a race-neutral\n\nexplanation, we interpreted the district court's action \"as an\n\nimplicit rejection of [the defendant's] prima facie case of a\n\nBatson violation\").      The government stated it struck Juror No. 23\n\nbecause the prospective juror was an attorney.         Other courts have\n\nnot only permitted such peremptory challenges, but have, sua\n\nsponte, declared their obviousness.         For example, a district court\n\nin the District of Massachusetts, without asking the prosecution to\n\njustify a strike against a prospective juror who was an attorney,\n\nstated, \"[O]ne can think of many reasons why we wouldn't want an\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\fattorney on a criminal case.\"         Id. at 114.   The government stated\n\nit attempted to strike Juror No. 37 because the prospective juror\n\nwas a member of the clergy.            Other courts have permitted such\n\nperemptory challenges.      For example, the U.S. Court of Appeals for\n\nthe   Fifth   Circuit    found   to   be   race-neutral   the   government's\n\nperemptory challenge of an African-American prospective juror who\n\nindicated that she and her husband were ordained ministers and the\n\ngovernment inferred that she might have a higher threshold of\n\nreasonable doubt.       Mixon, 977 F.3d at 923.     The government stated\n\nit struck Juror No. 43 because the prospective juror had a son in\n\nprison for a crime similar to the one charged against Charlton:\n\npossession of a firearm.          The defense did not object to the\n\nperemptory challenge against Juror No. 43 at the time but cites the\n\nstrike on appeal as part of the totality of the circumstances that\n\nindicate that the government intended \"to eliminate or minimize an\n\nAfrican-American presence on the jury.\"           However, other circuits\n\nhave upheld similar juror dismissals.          See, e.g., United States v.\n\nHendrix, 509 F.3d 362, 370 (7th Cir. 2007) (finding \"a valid and\n\nrace-neutral basis for the strikes\" where prosecution exercised\n\nperemptory    challenges    against    three   jurors,    all   of   whom   had\n\nrelatives in prison); United States v. Crawford, 413 F.3d 873, 875\n\n(8th Cir. 2005) (\"There is no Batson violation when a juror is\n\ndismissed because the juror's relatives have been prosecuted or\n\nconvicted of a crime . . . .\").\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\f             Finally,      there     is     no    evidence     in   the    record   that\n\nsimilarly     situated     jurors      (attorneys,         members    of    clergy,   or\n\nrelatives of convicts) from outside the allegedly targeted group of\n\nAfrican-Americans were permitted to serve. In fact, the government\n\nwas consistent when, according to the trial transcript, the only\n\nother similarly situated prospective juror, Juror No. 47, who\n\nstated she had a relative in jail for possession of a firearm, was\n\nconsidered as an alternate juror.                     As with Juror No. 43, the\n\ngovernment     exercised         a    peremptory          challenge       against   this\n\nprospective (alternate) juror, offering the same explanation in the\n\nprocess,     notwithstanding         that    Juror     No.    47    was   not   African-\n\nAmerican.\n\n             Having consulted all of the circumstances that bear upon\n\nthe issue of racial animosity, we conclude that Charlton failed to\n\nestablish    that    the    government           purposely    discriminated     against\n\nAfrican-Americans in exercising its peremptory challenge against\n\nJuror No. 23 and thus the district court committed no error --\n\nclear   or   plain   --     in   permitting         the    government's      peremptory\n\nchallenge against that prospective juror.                    Furthermore, we are not\n\nleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court\n\nmade a mistake in deciding that Charlton failed to prove that the\n\nstrike constituted purposeful discrimination on the basis of race.\n\nWe have not determined an inherent discriminatory intent in the\n\ngovernment's explanation for striking Juror No. 23, and so deem the\n\n\n                                            -22-\n\freason offered -- that she was an attorney and the government did\n\nnot want an attorney on the jury -- to be race-neutral.                  Thus,\n\ncontrary to Charlton's contention, we glean no purpose by the\n\ngovernment to eliminate or minimize an African-American presence on\n\nthe jury.\n\nB.   Predicate Convictions\n\n            Charlton was convicted of being a felon in possession of\n\na firearm under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) and subsequently sentenced\n\nunder the provisions of the ACCA.           On appeal, Charlton argues that\n\nhis Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury was violated because the\n\ngovernment did not plead or prove beyond a reasonable doubt the\n\nrequisite predicate convictions, nor did Charlton admit to those\n\nconvictions.      Consequently, Charlton states, his sentence must be\n\nvacated   and    the   matter    remanded    for   resentencing.   \"We   have\n\nconsistently rejected this argument in light of Supreme Court\n\nprecedent.\"      United States v. LaFortune, 520 F.3d 50, 58 (1st Cir.\n\n2008).    As discussed below, because of the Supreme Court's and our\n\nown precedent on this matter, we must uphold Charlton's sentence.\n\nSee Richards, 456 F.3d at 262.\n\n            On    appeal,       Charlton     acknowledges   that   we    have\n\ncharacterized as \"hopeless\" claims\n\n            that the Fifth and Sixth Amendments precluded\n            the     district  court    from   classifying\n            [appellant] as an armed career criminal\n            because (i) the indictment did not charge him\n            as   an    armed career  criminal   and  (ii)\n            [appellant] did not admit -- nor did a jury\n\n                                      -23-\n\f            find -- that [appellant's] prior crimes\n            qualified as predicate offenses under the\n            ACCA.\n\nId.   Charlton's characterization is accurate.            \"[A] sentencing\n\nenhancement may be grounded on prior criminal convictions neither\n\nseparately charged nor proven to a jury.\"        Id. (citing Almendárez-\n\nTorres, 523 U.S. at 226-27).      \"[T]his court normally is bound by a\n\nSupreme Court precedent unless and until the Court itself disavows\n\nthat precedent.     For that reason, we recently have rejected a\n\nparade of similarly sculpted challenges to the continuing vitality\n\nof Almendárez-Torres [in the context of the ACCA].           We reiterate\n\nthose holdings today.\"     Id. (internal citations omitted).\n\n            We conclude that the district court did not err in\n\nsentencing Charlton as an armed career criminal.\n\n                           III.     Conclusion\n\n            We find no error in the district court's granting of the\n\ngovernment's peremptory strike against Juror No. 23.         We are bound\n\nby precedent in rejecting Charlton's ACCA claim.                Charlton's\n\nconviction   and   the   district    court's   sentence   are   thus   both\n\naffirmed.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                    \"Concurring opinion follows\"\n\n\n\n\n                                    -24-\n\f          LYNCH, Chief Judge, concurring.        Sometimes the whole can\n\nbe greater than the sum of the parts, including in Batson cases.\n\nI write separately to emphasize that the defendant's underlying\n\ntheory is sound, though little help to him here.            Even if the\n\nprosecution offers facially neutral reasons for striking individual\n\nmembers of protected groups at the time of the strike, if those\n\nstrikes together later create a concern that certain groups are\n\nunderrepresented, it may well make sense for a trial judge to take\n\na second look at the exclusions.\n\n          Batson     and   its   progeny   are   not   ultimately   about\n\nstatistical disparities or disparate impact; they are about animus.\n\nSee Snyder v. Louisiana, 552 U.S. 472, 478 (2008).           Determining\n\nwhen a party acted with discriminatory purpose when exercising its\n\nperemptory challenges with is never easy and is not well suited for\n\nbright-line rules.    See Miller-El v. Dretke, 545 U.S. 231, 238-40\n\n(2005). The Supreme Court's recent jurisprudence reminds courts to\n\nconsider \"all of the circumstances that bear upon the issue of\n\nracial animosity.\"     Snyder, 552 U.S. at 478; see also Miller-El,\n\n545 U.S. at 240 (\"If any facially neutral reason sufficed to answer\n\na Batson challenge, then Batson would not amount to much more than\n\nSwain.   Some stated reasons are false, and although some false\n\nreasons are shown up within the four corners of a given case,\n\nsometimes a court may not be sure unless it looks beyond the case\n\nat hand.\").\n\n\n                                   -25-\n\f            But objections based solely on numerical effects are\n\ninherently problematic. Although courts may consider statistics as\n\nevidence of discrimination, Miller-El, 545 U.S. at 240-41, the\n\nSupreme Court has not accepted the proposition that a showing of\n\ndisparate impact alone meets the Batson requirement, see Hernandez\n\nv. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 362 (1991) (plurality opinion) (\"An\n\nargument relating to the impact of a classification does not alone\n\nshow its purpose.\").\n\n            Relying only on statistics to uncover discriminatory\n\nintent can be over- or underinclusive.         Prosecutors often exercise\n\nperemptories    against   a    series   of   minority   jurors   for   valid,\n\nnondiscriminatory reasons.        And no matter how many or how few\n\nminority jurors the government strikes, \"[t]he Constitution forbids\n\nstriking even a single prospective juror for a discriminatory\n\npurpose.\"      Snyder, 552 U.S. at 478 (quoting United States v.\n\nVasquez-Lopez, 22 F.3d 900, 902 (9th Cir. 1994)).\n\n            Frequently    in    life,    later,    related   events     have\n\nexplanatory power as to what happened earlier. Thus an explanation\n\nfor a strike that seems minimally adequate at the time may look\n\nmore suspect in light of later challenges.          The cumulative impact\n\nof a series of peremptories is one of many facts courts can\n\nconsider when interpreting a prosecutor's motives.\n\n            Here, the defendant has no more than numbers, as Judge\n\nTorruella's opinion clearly explains.         The other facts do not show\n\n\n                                    -26-\n\fthat the government acted with animus.           The government exercised\n\ntwo peremptories to which Charlton objects, first against an\n\nattorney and then, initially, against a clergymember.          In the end,\n\nthe prosecution decided, after it looked at the assembled jurors,\n\nnot to strike Juror No. 37 (the clergymember), which removed any\n\nsuspicion   of   a   Batson   violation   from   the   case.    While   the\n\ndefendant's case has been ably argued, there was no error.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -27-\n\f",

Howard, with whom Kacavas Ramsdell &amp; Howard, PLLC, was on brief for appellant.</p>\n<p>Robert E. Richardson, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, Chief Judge, TORRUELLA and BOUDIN, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Trevor Charlton (\"Charlton\"), an African-American, was convicted by a jury of one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm,<sup>[1]</sup> in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).<sup>[2]</sup> The district court enhanced Charlton's sentence pursuant to the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*46</span> Armed Career Criminal Act (\"the ACCA\"), 18 U.S.C. § 924(e).<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>On appeal, Charlton makes two claims. First, Charlton contends that the empanelment of the jury that convicted him was tainted by racial discrimination in violation of the Constitution and <i>Batson v. Kentucky,</i> 476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90, L.Ed.2d 69 (1986). Second, Charlton argues that the district court's imposition of the ACCA enhancement violated his Constitutional rights because the government did not plead or prove beyond a reasonable doubt the requisite predicate convictions, nor did Charlton admit those convictions. Finding that the district court committed no error in granting the government's peremptory strike at issue in this case, we affirm Charlton's conviction. Furthermore, finding that we are bound by the United States Supreme Court ruling in <i>Almendárez-Torres v. United States,</i> 523 U.S. 224, 226-27, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), and our own precedent in <i>United States v. Richards,</i> 456 F.3d 260, 262 (1st Cir.2006), <i>cert. denied,</i> 550 U.S. 905, 127 S.Ct. 2097, 167 L.Ed.2d 816 (2007), we affirm Charlton's sentence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Facts and Procedural History</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Incident (2004) and Indictment (2004)</h2>\n<p>As we observed in 2007, when this case was first before us, the events leading to Charlton's arrest are generally undisputed, and their substance is not at issue on this appeal either. We thus will present these events even more briefly than we did in our prior opinion in this matter. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Charlton,</i> 502 F.3d 1, 2-4 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>During the evening of July 25, 2004, while investigating a shooting, police in Brockton, Massachusetts found a loaded firearm wrapped in a white shirt on a porch near where Charlton was standing with four other men. Later that night, after first offering various denials, Charlton admitted to the police that he possessed the firearm, owned the white shirt, and had recently stabbed a man.</p>\n<p>On September 29, 2004, a grand jury sitting in Boston, Massachusetts, returned a one-count indictment against Charlton, charging him with being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. First Trial (2006) and Charlton's Denied Motion to Dismiss (2006)</h2>\n<p>On March 13, 2006, Charlton's first trial began. Seven days later, on the government's motion and over Charlton's objection, the district court declared a mistrial after the jury repeatedly declared it was deadlocked.</p>\n<p>On May 23, 2006, Charlton filed a motion to dismiss the indictment against him on the ground that \"further prosecution would violate the Double Jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\" On June 12, 2006, the district court denied Charlton's motion. <i>United States v. Charlton,</i> 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97012, at *14 (D. Mass., June 12, 2006). On August 10, 2007, we affirmed. <i>Charlton,</i> 502 F.3d at 6.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*47</span> C. Second TrialJury Selection (2007)</h2>\n<p>On December 3, 2007, Charlton's second trial began, and jury selection commenced. Because this was a non-capital felony case, the government possessed six peremptory challenges to prospective jurors and Charlton had ten. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 24(b)(2). Each side also possessed one additional peremptory challenge for the two prospective alternate jurors. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 24(c)(4)(A).</p>\n<p>The district court qualified the venire, which consisted of fifty-five potential jurors. The district court and defense counsel argued about the precise number of African-Americans in the jury pool, which defense counsel stated was seven and the district court at one point estimated was twelve.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Peremptory ChallengesRound One</h2>\n<p>The district court proceeded by seating the first twelve potential jurors, which the defense noted included two African-Americans. The government then exercised three of its peremptory challenges, striking Juror No. 23, one of the two African-Americans. Next, the defense exercised five of its peremptory challenges, after which the defense objected to the government's peremptory challenge of Juror No. 23, stating: \"she's one of the two black jurors seated in the jury, and I think one of the few black jurors in the jury pool.\" The government attorney, when asked by the district court if he \"want[ed] to give a reason for the record,\" responded: \"It has nothing to do with the race, just she's an attorney, and I do not want an attorney on the jury.\" The district court accepted this explanation and excused Juror No. 23.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Peremptory ChallengesRound Two</h2>\n<p>The district court then seated eight new potential jurors, including one African-American. The defense then exercised two of its five remaining peremptory challenges. The government followed by exercising one of its three remaining peremptory challenges, striking Juror No. 37, the newly called African-American. The defense again objected, stating: \"This is the second African-American that's being challenged. Our client is entitled to a fair jury. If she's off, there will be one African-American on the jury, and I'm pressing that.\" The government, when asked by the district court why he was striking the prospective juror, responded:</p>\n<blockquote>[S]he's a member of the clergy. It has nothing to do with race.... Whether she was black, white, Hispanic, Asian, male or female, I'd be challenging her because I think members of the clergy tend to be more sympathetic towards people and less likely to judge them, and I note for the record the first two that I challenged last time happened to be white males.</blockquote>\n<p>The district court accepted this explanation, stating: \"I do know that, typically speaking, prosecutors challenge clergy. I mean, that's the way they do it, so I'm not going to call this a black challenge.\"</p>\n<p>After then determining that there was a maximum of two African-Americans in the remaining jury pool,<sup>[5]</sup> the district court, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*48</span> referring to one of those prospective jurors, asked the government: \"She is African-American, and I'm not striking three, so will you withdraw [your peremptory challenge]?\" The government agreed to withdraw its peremptory challenge against Juror No. 37.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Peremptory ChallengesRounds Three Through Six</h2>\n<p>In the third round, the district court seated two new potential jurors, one of which the defense struck. In the fourth round, the district court seated one new potential juror, which the defense struck. At this point, the defense had one remaining peremptory challenge and, because it had withdrawn its previous peremptory challenge, the government had three. In the fifth round, the district court seated one new potential juror, which the defense struck, exhausting its peremptory challenges.</p>\n<p>In the sixth round, the district court seated one new potential juror, Juror No. 43, an African-American. The government exercised one of its three remaining peremptory challenges, striking Juror No. 43. The government, without prompting from the district court, provided the following explanation, to which the defense did not object:</p>\n<blockquote>Your Honor, this is a juror who indicated that she's got a son who went to prison for possession of a firearm. Therefore I'm going to exercise a peremptory as to her. And I just do want to make a record that I understand the Court's position, but for whatever it's worth, I do think it's unfair that the government is precluded, for reasons that have absolutely nothing to do with race, from challenging people that under any other circumstance would be unremarkable anyway. That's why I'm challenging this juror.</blockquote>\n<p>At this point, the defense had no remaining peremptory challenges and the government had two.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. Peremptory ChallengesFinal Rounds</h2>\n<p>The district court then seated the final juror, after which the district court called the first two candidates for the alternate slots. The government exercised its sole peremptory challenge for the two prospective alternate jurors, striking Juror No. 47, who was not African-American. The government, without prompting from the district court, provided the following explanation, to which the defense did not object: \"This is the other individual who indicated in this case [that] a[] cousin[,] I believe, is in jail for possession [of a firearm].\" Afterwards, the district court seated one new potential alternative juror, to which neither party objected.</p>\n<p>Of the twelve jurors who were ultimately empaneled, twoone of the first twelve prospective jurors to be called from the jury pool and Juror No. 37were African-American.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Second TrialStipulation (2007), Conviction (2007), Sentencing (2008), and Appeal (2008)</h2>\n<p>At trial, the parties stipulated to the fact that, prior to July 25, 2004, Charlton was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*49</span> convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year. The jury trial concluded after seven days on December 10, 2007, resulting in the conviction of Charlton.</p>\n<p>A presentence investigation report (\"PSI report\"), dated May 6, 2008, documented Charlton's prior criminal history, including three felony convictions under Massachusetts law. Concluding that these convictions subsumed either a violent felony or an applicable serious drug offense committed on occasions different from one another, the probation officer who prepared the PSI report recommended that Charlton be sentenced as an armed career criminala classification that would trigger a fifteen-year minimum sentence. 18 U.S.C. § 924(e). Absent that classification, Charlton's total offense level and prior criminal history would have placed him in a lower guidelines sentencing range and, therefore, probably would have yielded a lesser sentence than the district court imposed on him. On June 9, 2008, the district court, observing that Charlton \"had quite a few prior convictions,\" sentenced Charlton to a term of imprisonment of 204 months, sixty months of supervised release, and a $100 special assessment.</p>\n<p>Judgment was entered on June 11, 2008. Five days later, Charlton filed his timely notice of appeal. Charlton challenges both the peremptory challenges the government exercised in the process of jury empanelment and the imposition of the ACCA.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Batson</i> Challenge</h2>\n<p>On appeal, Charlton argues that empanelment of the jury that convicted him was tainted by racial discrimination and therefore violated his rights to equal protection of the law under the Fifth Amendment and <i>Batson,</i> 476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986). Charlton contends that the government's exercise of peremptory challenges \"was heavily weighted to exclude African-Americans from the jury.\" Charlton concedes that the government provided race-neutral explanations for its peremptory challenges. He argues, however, that \"those explanations appear pretextual.\" Consequently, Charlton states, his conviction must be reversed and the matter remanded for a new trial. As discussed below, we find that the district court committed no error in accepting the explanations for the peremptory challenges the government exercised at trial.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Background and Framework</h2>\n<p>The Supreme Court has observed that \"a defendant has no right to a petit jury composed in whole or in part of persons of his own race ... but the defendant does have the right to be tried by a jury whose members are selected pursuant to non-discriminatory criteria.\" <i>Batson,</i> 476 U.S. at 85-86, 106 S.Ct. 1712 (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing <i>Strauder v. West Virginia,</i> 100 U.S. 303, 305, 25 L.Ed. 664 (1880); <i>Martin v. Texas,</i> 200 U.S. 316, 321, 26 S.Ct. 338, 50 L.Ed. 497 (1906); <i>Ex parte Virginia,</i> 100 U.S. 339, 345, 25 L.Ed. 676 (1880)). As we have previously observed, in the 1986 case of <i>Batson,</i> the Supreme Court \"held that the defendant's equal protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment were violated where jury selection at his trial had been affected by invidious racial discrimination.\" <i>United States v. Girouard,</i> 521 F.3d 110, 112 (1st Cir.2008); <i>see also </i><i>Batson,</i> 476 U.S. at 89, 106 S.Ct. 1712 (\"[T]he component of the jury selection process at issue here, the State's privilege to strike individual jurors through peremptory challenges, is subject to the commands of the Equal Protection Clause. Although a prosecutor ordinarily is entitled to exercise permitted peremptory challenges for any reason at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*50</span> all, as long as that reason is related to his view concerning the outcome of the case to be tried, the Equal Protection Clause forbids the prosecutor to challenge potential jurors solely on account of their race or on the assumption that black jurors as a group will be unable impartially to consider the State's case against a black defendant.\") (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). \"<i>Batson</i> applies to proceedings in federal courts under the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause.\" <i>Girouard,</i> 521 F.3d at 112 n. 1.</p>\n<p>As we have also previously observed, \"[t]he <i>Batson</i> framework [for challenging jury composition] requires three steps.\" <i>Id.</i> at 113; <i>see also </i><i>Snyder v. Louisiana,</i> 552 U.S. 472, 476, 128 S.Ct. 1203, 170 L.Ed.2d 175 (2008). We have articulated those steps as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>First, the defendant must make a prima facie showing of discrimination in the prosecutor's launching of the strike. If the defendant fulfills this requirement by establishing, say, a prima facie case of a racially driven impetus, then the prosecutor must proffer a race-neutral explanation for having challenged the juror. If the prosecutor complies, then, at the third and final stage, the district court must decide whether the defendant has carried the ultimate burden of proving that the strike constituted purposeful discrimination on the basis of race.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Girouard,</i> 521 F.3d at 113 (\"The three-step process attempts to balance the time-honored principle of unfettered exercise of the peremptory challenge with a need to conform trial process to the Constitution.\"); <i>see also </i><i>Snyder,</i> 552 U.S. at 476-77, 128 S.Ct. 1203.</p>\n<p>\"The opponent of a strike bears the burden of proof throughout the inquiry.\" <i>Girouard,</i> 521 F.3d at 113. In order to establish a prima facie case of discrimination, \"the moving party must `raise an inference that the prosecutor used [peremptory challenges] to exclude the veniremen from the petit jury' because of their membership in a protected class.\" <i>Aspen v. Bissonnette,</i> 480 F.3d 571, 574 (1st Cir. 2007) (citation omitted). We have recognized that \"the Supreme Court has recently reiterated that the <i>Batson</i> prima facie standard is not onerous.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Johnson v. California,</i> 545 U.S. 162, 170, 125 S.Ct. 2410, 162 L.Ed.2d 129 (2005)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Standard / Scope of Review</h2>\n<p>A preserved <i>Batson</i> claim is one in which contemporaneous objection was raised at trial; an unpreserved <i>Batson</i> claim is one in which no such objection was raised at trial. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Pulgarin,</i> 955 F.2d 1, 1-2 (1st Cir.1992). \"We review preserved <i>Batson</i> claims for clear error, including cases in which the trial court finds no prima facie case of discrimination.\" <i>Girouard,</i> 521 F.3d at 115; <i>see also </i><i>Snyder,</i> 552 U.S. at 477, 128 S.Ct. 1203. \"We will not find clear error unless, after reviewing all of the evidence, we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\" <i>United States v. González-Meléndez,</i> 594 F.3d 28, 35 (1st Cir.2010) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \"We... apply plain error review to unpreserved <i>Batson</i> claims....\" <i>Girouard,</i> 521 F.3d at 115. In applying this standard of review, we have observed a Supreme Court ruling that, \"[u]nless a discriminatory intent is inherent in the prosecutor's explanation, the reason offered will be deemed race neutral.\" <i>Pulgarin,</i> 955 F.2d at 2 (citing <i>Hernández v. New York,</i> 500 U.S. 352, 360, 111 S.Ct. 1859, 114 L.Ed.2d 395 (1991)).</p>\n<p>\"We have cautioned those who object to peremptory strikes that they <span class=\"star-pagination\">*51</span> should come forward with facts, not just numbers alone.\" <i>Girouard,</i> 521 F.3d at 116 (internal quotation marks omitted). Rather, \"in considering a <i>Batson</i> objection, or in reviewing a ruling claimed to be <i>Batson</i> error, all of the circumstances that bear upon the issue of racial animosity must be consulted.\" <i>Snyder,</i> 552 U.S. at 478, 128 S.Ct. 1203. Those circumstances include both numeric and non-numeric forms of evidence:</p>\n<blockquote>Relevant numeric evidence includes the percentage of strikes directed against members of a particular group, the percentage of a particular group removed from the venire by the challenged strikes, and a comparison of the percentage of a group's representation in the venire to its representation on the jury. Relevant non-numeric evidence includes the striking party's questions and statements during the voir dire, whether the striking party had unused peremptory challenges through which he or she could have eliminated more members of the allegedly targeted group, apparent non-discriminatory reasons for striking potential jurors based on their voir dire answers, and whether similarly situated jurors from outside the allegedly targeted group were permitted to serve....</blockquote>\n<p><i>Aspen,</i> 480 F.3d at 577 (internal citations omitted). \"We follow this approach of looking at all relevant circumstances even in cases where we are reviewing a district court's finding that no prima facie case has been made.\" <i>Girouard,</i> 521 F.3d at 115-16.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Analysis</h2>\n<p>We consider below both the proper standard/scope of review to employ in this matter, as well as Charlton's specific <i>Batson</i> challenge.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. Standard/Scope of Review</h2>\n<p>Charlton contends that we should review his <i>Batson</i> challenge to the striking of Juror No. 23 for clear error. The government suggests, rather, that we should review Charlton's challenge for plain error. The government supports its argument by observing that Charlton did not renew his challenge when the purported purposeful discrimination became apparent: after the government withdrew its strike of Juror No. 37,<sup>[6]</sup> and then exercised a peremptory challenge against Juror No. 43. We need not take a position on this matter, as we find that the district court committed no errorclear or plainin denying Charlton's <i>Batson</i> challenge.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. Charlton's Specific <i>Batson</i> Challenge</h2>\n<p>Charlton focuses his <i>Batson</i> claim on the government's exercise of a peremptory challenge against Juror No. 23. At trial, Charlton objected to the striking of Juror No. 23 on <i>Batson</i> grounds. As discussed below, Charlton has relied entirely on the number of prosecution strikes against African-Americans. As we have previously held, \"[i]t is at least questionable whether this evidence is adequate to surpass the prima facie hurdle.\" <i>Aspen,</i> 480 F.3d at 577 (citing <i>United States v. Esparsen,</i> 930 F.2d 1461, 1467 (10th Cir. 1991) (\"By itself, the number of challenges used against members of a particular [group] is not sufficient to establish ... a prima facie case.\")) (alteration in original). But even assuming that Charlton could establish a prima facie case, it is clear that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*52</span> he cannot ultimately establish a <i>Batson</i> violation.</p>\n<p>Charlton concedes in his appellate brief that the reason the government offered at trialthat Juror No. 23 is \"an attorney, and I do not want an attorney on the jury\"\"is a sufficient race-neutral explanation for the challenge and, standing alone, would vitiate his argument.\" Charlton contends, however, that the totality of the circumstances indicates that \"a purpose to eliminate or minimize an African-American presence on the jury can be gleaned, and accordingly Charlton's rights were violated.\"</p>\n<p>To support his totality-of-the-circumstances argument, Charlton points to several developments throughout the process of voir dire. First, Charlton emphasizes that the government exercised \"only one\" peremptory challenge in the second round in which the district court called prospective jurors when it struck Juror No. 37, the sole newly called African-American. Second, Charlton points to the fact that the jury that was ultimately empaneled included two African-Americans, \"one of whom[, Juror No. 37,] was seated only because the prosecutor withdrew his peremptory challenge in the face of a <i>Batson</i> challenge.\" Finally, Charlton notes that the government attempted to exercise three, or fifty percent, of its six peremptory challenges on African-Americans: Juror No. 23, Juror No. 37, and Juror No. 43. Charlton contends that, although the government withdrew its peremptory challenge against Juror No. 37, \"the government's use of half of its challenges to rid, or attempt to rid[,] the jury of three (3) of the four (4) African-Americans who were seated casts a pall over the selection process that amounts to discrimination and undercuts the prosecutor's stated reason for challenging Juror No. 23.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>i. Relevant Numeric Evidence</h2>\n<p>Charlton's argument is unavailing given our consultation of all of the circumstances that bear upon the issue of racial animosity. Although on appeal Charlton focuses his <i>Batson</i> claim on the government's exercise of a peremptory challenge against Juror No. 23, our totality-of-the-circumstances analysis will also evaluate the government's treatment of other prospective jurors. We begin by considering the relevant numeric evidence.</p>\n<p>First, Charlton correctly notes that fifty percent of the government's strikes were directed against members of a particular group, African-Americans. Second, if we take the most conservative estimate of African-Americans in the jury pool, seven, these strikes resulted in three out of seven, or forty-three percent, of a particular group, African-Americans, being removed from the venire. Since only one of these strikesagainst Juror No. 23is directly challenged on appeal, the percentage of a particular group, African-Americans, being removed from the venire by the challenged strike is one out of seven, or fourteen percent.</p>\n<p>Third, if we compare the percentage of a group's representation in the venire to its representation on the jury, we find the two percentages to be similar. Again adopting the conservative estimate of African-Americans in the jury pool, we find that African-Americans comprised seven out of fifty-five, or thirteen percent, of the venire, and they comprised two out of twelve, or seventeen percent, of the jury that was ultimately empaneled. The proportion of African-Americans on the empaneled jury was thus actually slightly higher than in the venire.</p>\n<p>In submitting this <i>Batson</i> claim concerning Juror No. 23, Charlton appeals to \"just numbers alone,\" precisely what we have cautioned against. <i>See </i><i>Girouard,</i> 521 F.3d <span class=\"star-pagination\">*53</span> at 116 (citation omitted). The government's use of half of its statutorily permitted peremptory challenges to rid, or attempt to rid, the jury of three of the four African-Americans who were seated does not necessarily amount to racial discrimination and does not necessarily undercut the government's stated reason for challenging Juror No. 23.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>ii. Relevant Non-Numeric Evidence</h2>\n<p>This finding is further supported by the relevant non-numeric evidence. First, the government did not ask any questions or make any statements during voir dire that suggested it was operating with racial animosity towards African-Americans.</p>\n<p>Second, by the end of voir dire for the prospective jurors, the government had two unused peremptory challenges through which it could have eliminated more members of the allegedly targeted group of African-Americans. One African-American was seated in the first round of voir dire and the government did not strike or attempt to strike that person at any point during voir dire. As other circuits have found, this circumstance suggests that the government was not exercising its peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>King v. Moore,</i> 196 F.3d 1327, 1335 (11th Cir.1999) (rejecting a prospective African-American juror \"after accepting another black venireperson... [indicates] not only was there no pattern of discriminatory strikes, there was a sort of `antipattern'\"); <i>United States v. Mixon,</i> 977 F.2d 921, 923 (5th Cir.1992) (in a situation in which \"[t]he government used five out of its six challenges against blacks[, t]he one black accepted by the government weakens the argument that the government was accepting jurors solely on a racial basis\").</p>\n<p>Third, the government offered apparent non-discriminatory reasons for striking potential jurors based on their voir dire answers. The defense concedes on appeal that the explanations the government provided were \"race-neutral.\" The district court accepted each explanation, either implicitly, by not soliciting an explanation and not rejecting the peremptory challenge, or explicitly, by soliciting an explanation and then not rejecting the peremptory challenge. <i>See </i><i>Girouard,</i> 521 F.3d at 115 (where defense counsel objected on religious grounds to a peremptory challenge and the district court refused to ask the prosecutor for a race-neutral explanation, we interpreted the district court's action \"as an implicit rejection of [the defendant's] prima facie case of a <i>Batson</i> violation\"). The government stated it struck Juror No. 23 because the prospective juror was an attorney. Other courts have not only permitted such peremptory challenges, but have, <i>sua sponte,</i> declared their obviousness. For example, a district court in the District of Massachusetts, without asking the prosecution to justify a strike against a prospective juror who was an attorney, stated, \"[O]ne can think of many reasons why we wouldn't want an attorney on a criminal case.\" <i>Id.</i> at 114, 106 S.Ct. 1712. The government stated it attempted to strike Juror No. 37 because the prospective juror was a member of the clergy. Other courts have permitted such peremptory challenges. For example, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit found to be race-neutral the government's peremptory challenge of an African-American prospective juror who indicated that she and her husband were ordained ministers and the government inferred that she might have a higher threshold of reasonable doubt. <i>Mixon,</i> 977 F.2d at 923. The government stated it struck Juror No. 43 because the prospective juror had a son in prison for a crime similar to the one charged against Charlton: possession of a firearm. The defense did not object to the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*54</span> peremptory challenge against Juror No. 43 at the time but cites the strike on appeal as part of the totality of the circumstances that indicate that the government intended \"to eliminate or minimize an African-American presence on the jury.\" However, other circuits have upheld similar juror dismissals. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Hendrix,</i> 509 F.3d 362, 370 (7th Cir.2007) (finding \"a valid and race-neutral basis for the strikes\" where prosecution exercised peremptory challenges against three jurors, all of whom had relatives in prison); <i>United States v. Crawford,</i> 413 F.3d 873, 875 (8th Cir.2005) (\"There is no <i>Batson</i> violation when a juror is dismissed because the juror's relatives have been prosecuted or convicted of a crime....\").</p>\n<p>Finally, there is no evidence in the record that similarly situated jurors (attorneys, members of clergy, or relatives of convicts) from outside the allegedly targeted group of African-Americans were permitted to serve. In fact, the government was consistent when, according to the trial transcript, the only other similarly situated prospective juror, Juror No. 47, who stated she had a relative in jail for possession of a firearm, was considered as an alternate juror. As with Juror No. 43, the government exercised a peremptory challenge against this prospective (alternate) juror, offering the same explanation in the process, notwithstanding that Juror No. 47 was not African-American.</p>\n<p>Having consulted all of the circumstances that bear upon the issue of racial animosity, we conclude that Charlton failed to establish that the government purposely discriminated against African-Americans in exercising its peremptory challenge against Juror No. 23 and thus the district court committed no errorclear or plain in permitting the government's peremptory challenge against that prospective juror. Furthermore, we are not left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court made a mistake in deciding that Charlton failed to prove that the strike constituted purposeful discrimination on the basis of race. We have not determined an inherent discriminatory intent in the government's explanation for striking Juror No. 23, and so deem the reason offeredthat she was an attorney and the government did not want an attorney on the juryto be race-neutral. Thus, contrary to Charlton's contention, we glean no purpose by the government to eliminate or minimize an African-American presence on the jury.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Predicate Convictions</h2>\n<p>Charlton was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) and subsequently sentenced under the provisions of the ACCA. On appeal, Charlton argues that his Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury was violated because the government did not plead or prove beyond a reasonable doubt the requisite predicate convictions, nor did Charlton admit to those convictions. Consequently, Charlton states, his sentence must be vacated and the matter remanded for resentencing. \"We have consistently rejected this argument in light of Supreme Court precedent.\" <i>United States v. LaFortune,</i> 520 F.3d 50, 58 (1st Cir.2008). As discussed below, because of the Supreme Court's and our own precedent on this matter, we must uphold Charlton's sentence. <i>See </i><i>Richards,</i> 456 F.3d at 262.</p>\n<p>On appeal, Charlton acknowledges that we have characterized as \"hopeless\" claims</p>\n<blockquote>that the Fifth and Sixth Amendments precluded the district court from classifying [appellant] as an armed career criminal because (i) the indictment did not charge him as an armed career criminal and (ii) [appellant] did not admit <span class=\"star-pagination\">*55</span> nor did a jury findthat [appellant's] prior crimes qualified as predicate offenses under the ACCA.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> Charlton's characterization is accurate. \"[A] sentencing enhancement may be grounded on prior criminal convictions neither separately charged nor proven to a jury.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Almendárez-Torres,</i> 523 U.S. at 226-27, 118 S.Ct. 1219). \"[T]his court normally is bound by a Supreme Court precedent unless and until the Court itself disavows that precedent. For that reason, we recently have rejected a parade of similarly sculpted challenges to the continuing vitality of <i>Almendárez-Torres</i> [in the context of the ACCA]. We reiterate those holdings today.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p>We conclude that the district court did not err in sentencing Charlton as an armed career criminal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We find no error in the district court's granting of the government's peremptory strike against Juror No. 23. We are bound by precedent in rejecting Charlton's ACCA claim. Charlton's conviction and the district court's sentence are thus both affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<p>LYNCH, Chief Judge, concurring.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the whole can be greater than the sum of the parts, including in <i>Batson</i> cases. I write separately to emphasize that the defendant's underlying theory is sound, though of little help to him here. Even if the prosecution offers facially neutral reasons for striking individual members of protected groups at the time of the strike, if those strikes together later create a concern that certain groups are underrepresented, it may well make sense for a trial judge to take a second look at the exclusions.</p>\n<p><i>Batson</i> and its progeny are not ultimately about statistical disparities or disparate impact; they are about animus. <i>See </i><i>Snyder v. Louisiana,</i> 552 U.S. 472, 478, 128 S.Ct. 1203, 170 L.Ed.2d 175 (2008). Determining when a party acted with discriminatory purpose when exercising its peremptory challenges is never easy and is not well suited for bright-line rules. <i>See </i><i>Miller-El v. Dretke,</i> 545 U.S. 231, 238-40, 125 S.Ct. 2317, 162 L.Ed.2d 196 (2005). The Supreme Court's recent jurisprudence reminds courts to consider \"all of the circumstances that bear upon the issue of racial animosity.\" <i>Snyder,</i> 552 U.S. at 478, 128 S.Ct. 1203; <i>see also </i><i>Miller-El,</i> 545 U.S. at 240, 125 S.Ct. 2317 (\"If any facially neutral reason sufficed to answer a <i>Batson</i> challenge, then <i>Batson</i> would not amount to much more than <i>Swain.</i> Some stated reasons are false, and although some false reasons are shown up within the four corners of a given case, sometimes a court may not be sure unless it looks beyond the case at hand.\").</p>\n<p>But objections based solely on numerical effects are inherently problematic. Although courts may consider statistics as evidence of discrimination, <i>Miller-El,</i> 545 U.S. at 240-41, 125 S.Ct. 2317, the Supreme Court has not accepted the proposition that a showing of disparate impact alone meets the <i>Batson</i> requirement, <i>see </i><i>Hernandez v. New York,</i> 500 U.S. 352, 362, 111 S.Ct. 1859, 114 L.Ed.2d 395 (1991) (plurality opinion) (\"An argument relating to the impact of a classification does not alone show its purpose.\").</p>\n<p>Relying only on statistics to uncover discriminatory intent can be over- or underinclusive. Prosecutors often exercise peremptories against a series of minority jurors for valid, nondiscriminatory reasons. And no matter how many or how few minority jurors the government strikes, \"[t]he Constitution forbids striking <span class=\"star-pagination\">*56</span> even a single prospective juror for a discriminatory purpose.\" <i>Snyder,</i> 552 U.S. at 478, 128 S.Ct. 1203 (quoting <i>United States v. Vasquez-Lopez,</i> 22 F.3d 900, 902 (9th Cir.1994)).</p>\n<p>Frequently in life, later, related events have explanatory power as to what happened earlier. Thus an explanation for a strike that seems minimally adequate at the time may look more suspect in light of later challenges. The cumulative impact of a series of peremptories is one of many facts courts can consider when interpreting a prosecutor's motives.</p>\n<p>Here, the defendant has no more than numbers, as Judge Torruella's opinion clearly explains. The other facts do not show that the government acted with animus. The government exercised two peremptories to which Charlton objects, first against an attorney and then, initially, against a clergymember. In the end, the prosecution decided, after it looked at the assembled jurors, not to strike Juror No. 37 (the clergymember), which removed any suspicion of a <i>Batson</i> violation from the case. While the defendant's case has been ably argued, there was no error.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Specifically, the grand jury charged that, \"[o]n or about July 25, 2004, in Brockton in the District of Massachusetts, ... Charlton... [,] having previously been convicted in a court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, did knowingly possess, in and affecting commerce, a firearm, to wit, a Star, Model 30M, 9mm semi[-]automatic pistol, bearing serial number 1878329.\"</p>\n<p>[2]  18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) provides:\n</p>\n<p>It shall be unlawful for any person who has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.</p>\n<p>[3]  18 U.S.C. § 924(e) provides, in part:\n</p>\n<p>In the case of a person who violates section 922(g) of this title and has three previous convictions by any court referred to in section 922(g)(1) of this title for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another, such person shall be fined under this title and imprisoned not less than fifteen years, and, notwithstanding any other provision of law, the court shall not suspend the sentence of, or grant a probationary sentence to, such person with respect to the conviction under section 922(g).</p>\n<p>[4]  The district court alternated between saying that its estimate of the number of African-Americans in the jury pool \"doesn't even count the Chinese guy and the people with Hispanic surnames\" and \"included people with Hispanic and Chinese names.\"</p>\n<p>[5]  It is unclear whether, at this point, there was one African-American remaining in the jury pool, as the defense claims, or two, as the district court and the government seemed to suggest. The relevant portion of the transcript is as follows:\n</p>\n<p>THE COURT: On the other hand, there are two [African-Americans] out there in the pool, at least right now, that I would identify that way....</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>MR. RICHARDSON:before we get to it, who else are we calling African-American that's still out there?</p>\n<p>THE COURT: It looks like there are two.</p>\n<p>MS. BYRNE: One of them is his father.</p>\n<p>THE COURT: No. There's one.</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>MR. RICHARDSON: I'm just trying to figure out who they are because if one of them is being counted as African-American and one has a son serving in prison</p>\n<p>[6]  In its appellate brief, the government refers to \"juror number 23\" as the prospective juror against which the government withdrew a peremptory challenge. Appellee's Br. at 18. However, it is clear that the government meant Juror No. 37.</p>\n\n</div>",

First, Charlton contends that the empanelment of the jury that convicted him was tainted by racial discrimination in violation of the Constitution and <i>Batson v. Kentucky,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111662\"><a href=\"/opinion/111662/batson-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111662\"><a href=\"/opinion/111662/batson-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Second, Charlton argues that the district court's imposition of the ACCA enhancement violated his Constitutional rights because the government did not plead or prove beyond a reasonable doubt the requisite predicate convictions, nor did Charlton admit those convictions. Finding that the district court committed no error in granting the government's peremptory strike at issue in this case, we affirm Charlton's conviction.

Incident (2004) and Indictment (2004)</h2>\n<p>As we observed in 2007, when this case was first before us, the events leading to Charlton's arrest are generally undisputed, and their substance is not at issue on this appeal either. We thus will present these events even more briefly than we did in our prior opinion in this matter. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Charlton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202889\"><a href=\"/opinion/202889/united-states-v-charlton/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 2-4 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>During the evening of July 25, 2004, while investigating a shooting, police in Brockton, Massachusetts found a loaded firearm wrapped in a white shirt on a porch near where Charlton was standing with four other men. Later that night, after first offering various denials, Charlton admitted to the police that he possessed the firearm, owned the white shirt, and had recently stabbed a man.</p>\n<p>On September 29, 2004, a grand jury sitting in Boston, Massachusetts, returned a one-count indictment against Charlton, charging him with being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. First Trial (2006) and Charlton's Denied Motion to Dismiss (2006)</h2>\n<p>On March 13, 2006, Charlton's first trial began. Seven days later, on the government's motion and over Charlton's objection, the district court declared a mistrial after the jury repeatedly declared it was deadlocked.</p>\n<p>On May 23, 2006, Charlton filed a motion to dismiss the indictment against him on the ground that \"further prosecution would violate the Double Jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\" On June 12, 2006, the district court denied Charlton's motion. <i>United States v. Charlton,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. Dist. LEXIS</span> <span class=\"page\">97012</span></span>, at *14 (D. Mass., June 12, 2006). On August 10, 2007, we affirmed. <i>Charlton,</i> 502 F.3d at 6.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*47</span> C. Second TrialJury Selection (2007)</h2>\n<p>On December 3, 2007, Charlton's second trial began, and jury selection commenced. Because this was a non-capital felony case, the government possessed six peremptory challenges to prospective jurors and Charlton had ten. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 24(b)(2). Each side also possessed one additional peremptory challenge for the two prospective alternate jurors. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 24(c)(4)(A).</p>\n<p>The district court qualified the venire, which consisted of fifty-five potential jurors. The district court and defense counsel argued about the precise number of African-Americans in the jury pool, which defense counsel stated was seven and the district court at one point estimated was twelve.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Peremptory ChallengesRound One</h2>\n<p>The district court proceeded by seating the first twelve potential jurors, which the defense noted included two African-Americans. The government then exercised three of its peremptory challenges, striking Juror No. 23, one of the two African-Americans. Next, the defense exercised five of its peremptory challenges, after which the defense objected to the government's peremptory challenge of Juror No. 23, stating: \"she's one of the two black jurors seated in the jury, and I think one of the few black jurors in the jury pool.\" The government attorney, when asked by the district court if he \"want[ed] to give a reason for the record,\" responded: \"It has nothing to do with the race, just she's an attorney, and I do not want an attorney on the jury.\" The district court accepted this explanation and excused Juror No. 23.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Peremptory ChallengesRound Two</h2>\n<p>The district court then seated eight new potential jurors, including one African-American. The defense then exercised two of its five remaining peremptory challenges. The government followed by exercising one of its three remaining peremptory challenges, striking Juror No. 37, the newly called African-American. The defense again objected, stating: \"This is the second African-American that's being challenged. Our client is entitled to a fair jury. If she's off, there will be one African-American on the jury, and I'm pressing that.\" The government, when asked by the district court why he was striking the prospective juror, responded:</p>\n<blockquote>[S]he's a member of the clergy. It has nothing to do with race.... Whether she was black, white, Hispanic, Asian, male or female, I'd be challenging her because I think members of the clergy tend to be more sympathetic towards people and less likely to judge them, and I note for the record the first two that I challenged last time happened to be white males.</blockquote>\n<p>The district court accepted this explanation, stating: \"I do know that, typically speaking, prosecutors challenge clergy. I mean, that's the way they do it, so I'm not going to call this a black challenge.\"</p>\n<p>After then determining that there was a maximum of two African-Americans in the remaining jury pool,<sup>[5]</sup> the district court, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*48</span> referring to one of those prospective jurors, asked the government: \"She is African-American, and I'm not striking three, so will you withdraw [your peremptory challenge]?\" The government agreed to withdraw its peremptory challenge against Juror No. 37.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Peremptory ChallengesRounds Three Through Six</h2>\n<p>In the third round, the district court seated two new potential jurors, one of which the defense struck. In the fourth round, the district court seated one new potential juror, which the defense struck. At this point, the defense had one remaining peremptory challenge and, because it had withdrawn its previous peremptory challenge, the government had three. In the fifth round, the district court seated one new potential juror, which the defense struck, exhausting its peremptory challenges.</p>\n<p>In the sixth round, the district court seated one new potential juror, Juror No. 43, an African-American. The government exercised one of its three remaining peremptory challenges, striking Juror No. 43. The government, without prompting from the district court, provided the following explanation, to which the defense did not object:</p>\n<blockquote>Your Honor, this is a juror who indicated that she's got a son who went to prison for possession of a firearm. Therefore I'm going to exercise a peremptory as to her. And I just do want to make a record that I understand the Court's position, but for whatever it's worth, I do think it's unfair that the government is precluded, for reasons that have absolutely nothing to do with race, from challenging people that under any other circumstance would be unremarkable anyway. That's why I'm challenging this juror.</blockquote>\n<p>At this point, the defense had no remaining peremptory challenges and the government had two.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. Peremptory ChallengesFinal Rounds</h2>\n<p>The district court then seated the final juror, after which the district court called the first two candidates for the alternate slots. The government exercised its sole peremptory challenge for the two prospective alternate jurors, striking Juror No. 47, who was not African-American. The government, without prompting from the district court, provided the following explanation, to which the defense did not object: \"This is the other individual who indicated in this case [that] a[] cousin[,] I believe, is in jail for possession [of a firearm].\" Afterwards, the district court seated one new potential alternative juror, to which neither party objected.</p>\n<p>Of the twelve jurors who were ultimately empaneled, twoone of the first twelve prospective jurors to be called from the jury pool and Juror No. 37were African-American.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Second TrialStipulation (2007), Conviction (2007), Sentencing (2008), and Appeal (2008)</h2>\n<p>At trial, the parties stipulated to the fact that, prior to July 25, 2004, Charlton was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*49</span> convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year. The jury trial concluded after seven days on December 10, 2007, resulting in the conviction of Charlton.</p>\n<p>A presentence investigation report (\"PSI report\"), dated May 6, 2008, documented Charlton's prior criminal history, including three felony convictions under Massachusetts law. Concluding that these convictions subsumed either a violent felony or an applicable serious drug offense committed on occasions different from one another, the probation officer who prepared the PSI report recommended that Charlton be sentenced as an armed career criminala classification that would trigger a fifteen-year minimum sentence. 18 U.S.C. § 924(e). Absent that classification, Charlton's total offense level and prior criminal history would have placed him in a lower guidelines sentencing range and, therefore, probably would have yielded a lesser sentence than the district court imposed on him. On June 9, 2008, the district court, observing that Charlton \"had quite a few prior convictions,\" sentenced Charlton to a term of imprisonment of 204 months, sixty months of supervised release, and a $100 special assessment.</p>\n<p>Judgment was entered on June 11, 2008. Five days later, Charlton filed his timely notice of appeal. Charlton challenges both the peremptory challenges the government exercised in the process of jury empanelment and the imposition of the ACCA.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Batson</i> Challenge</h2>\n<p>On appeal, Charlton argues that empanelment of the jury that convicted him was tainted by racial discrimination and therefore violated his rights to equal protection of the law under the Fifth Amendment and <i>Batson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111662\"><a href=\"/opinion/111662/batson-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111662\"><a href=\"/opinion/111662/batson-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></a></span> (1986). Charlton contends that the government's exercise of peremptory challenges \"was heavily weighted to exclude African-Americans from the jury.\" Charlton concedes that the government provided race-neutral explanations for its peremptory challenges. He argues, however, that \"those explanations appear pretextual.\" Consequently, Charlton states, his conviction must be reversed and the matter remanded for a new trial.

Analysis</h2>\n<p>We consider below both the proper standard/scope of review to employ in this matter, as well as Charlton's specific <i>Batson</i> challenge.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. Standard/Scope of Review</h2>\n<p>Charlton contends that we should review his <i>Batson</i> challenge to the striking of Juror No. 23 for clear error. The government suggests, rather, that we should review Charlton's challenge for plain error. The government supports its argument by observing that Charlton did not renew his challenge when the purported purposeful discrimination became apparent: after the government withdrew its strike of Juror No. 37,<sup>[6]</sup> and then exercised a peremptory challenge against Juror No. 43. We need not take a position on this matter, as we find that the district court committed no errorclear or plainin denying Charlton's <i>Batson</i> challenge.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. Charlton's Specific <i>Batson</i> Challenge</h2>\n<p>Charlton focuses his <i>Batson</i> claim on the government's exercise of a peremptory challenge against Juror No. 23. At trial, Charlton objected to the striking of Juror No. 23 on <i>Batson</i> grounds. As discussed below, Charlton has relied entirely on the number of prosecution strikes against African-Americans. As we have previously held, \"[i]t is at least questionable whether this evidence is adequate to surpass the prima facie hurdle.\" <i>Aspen,</i> 480 F.3d at 577 (citing <i>United States v. Esparsen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"559573\"><a href=\"/opinion/559573/united-states-v-anthony-esparsen-united-states-of-america-v-kelly/\"><span class=\"volume\">930</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1461</span></a></span>, 1467 (10th Cir. 1991) (\"By itself, the number of challenges used against members of a particular [group] is not sufficient to establish ... a prima facie case.\")) (alteration in original). But even assuming that Charlton could establish a prima facie case, it is clear that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*52</span> he cannot ultimately establish a <i>Batson</i> violation.</p>\n<p>Charlton concedes in his appellate brief that the reason the government offered at trialthat Juror No. 23 is \"an attorney, and I do not want an attorney on the jury\"\"is a sufficient race-neutral explanation for the challenge and, standing alone, would vitiate his argument.\" Charlton contends, however, that the totality of the circumstances indicates that \"a purpose to eliminate or minimize an African-American presence on the jury can be gleaned, and accordingly Charlton's rights were violated.\"</p>\n<p>To support his totality-of-the-circumstances argument, Charlton points to several developments throughout the process of voir dire. First, Charlton emphasizes that the government exercised \"only one\" peremptory challenge in the second round in which the district court called prospective jurors when it struck Juror No. 37, the sole newly called African-American. Second, Charlton points to the fact that the jury that was ultimately empaneled included two African-Americans, \"one of whom[, Juror No. 37,] was seated only because the prosecutor withdrew his peremptory challenge in the face of a <i>Batson</i> challenge.\" Finally, Charlton notes that the government attempted to exercise three, or fifty percent, of its six peremptory challenges on African-Americans: Juror No. 23, Juror No. 37, and Juror No. 43. Charlton contends that, although the government withdrew its peremptory challenge against Juror No. 37, \"the government's use of half of its challenges to rid, or attempt to rid[,] the jury of three (3) of the four (4) African-Americans who were seated casts a pall over the selection process that amounts to discrimination and undercuts the prosecutor's stated reason for challenging Juror No. 23.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>i. Relevant Numeric Evidence</h2>\n<p>Charlton's argument is unavailing given our consultation of all of the circumstances that bear upon the issue of racial animosity. Although on appeal Charlton focuses his <i>Batson</i> claim on the government's exercise of a peremptory challenge against Juror No. 23, our totality-of-the-circumstances analysis will also evaluate the government's treatment of other prospective jurors. We begin by considering the relevant numeric evidence.</p>\n<p>First, Charlton correctly notes that fifty percent of the government's strikes were directed against members of a particular group, African-Americans. Second, if we take the most conservative estimate of African-Americans in the jury pool, seven, these strikes resulted in three out of seven, or forty-three percent, of a particular group, African-Americans, being removed from the venire. Since only one of these strikesagainst Juror No. 23is directly challenged on appeal, the percentage of a particular group, African-Americans, being removed from the venire by the challenged strike is one out of seven, or fourteen percent.</p>\n<p>Third, if we compare the percentage of a group's representation in the venire to its representation on the jury, we find the two percentages to be similar. Again adopting the conservative estimate of African-Americans in the jury pool, we find that African-Americans comprised seven out of fifty-five, or thirteen percent, of the venire, and they comprised two out of twelve, or seventeen percent, of the jury that was ultimately empaneled. The proportion of African-Americans on the empaneled jury was thus actually slightly higher than in the venire.</p>\n<p>In submitting this <i>Batson</i> claim concerning Juror No. 23, Charlton appeals to \"just numbers alone,\" precisely what we have cautioned against. <i>See </i><i>Girouard,</i> 521 F.3d <span class=\"star-pagination\">*53</span> at 116 (citation omitted). The government's use of half of its statutorily permitted peremptory challenges to rid, or attempt to rid, the jury of three of the four African-Americans who were seated does not necessarily amount to racial discrimination and does not necessarily undercut the government's stated reason for challenging Juror No. 23.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>ii. Relevant Non-Numeric Evidence</h2>\n<p>This finding is further supported by the relevant non-numeric evidence. First, the government did not ask any questions or make any statements during voir dire that suggested it was operating with racial animosity towards African-Americans.</p>\n<p>Second, by the end of voir dire for the prospective jurors, the government had two unused peremptory challenges through which it could have eliminated more members of the allegedly targeted group of African-Americans. One African-American was seated in the first round of voir dire and the government did not strike or attempt to strike that person at any point during voir dire. As other circuits have found, this circumstance suggests that the government was not exercising its peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>King v. Moore,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"74146\"><a href=\"/opinion/74146/king-v-moore/\"><span class=\"volume\">196</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1327</span></a></span>, 1335 (11th Cir.1999) (rejecting a prospective African-American juror \"after accepting another black venireperson... [indicates] not only was there no pattern of discriminatory strikes, there was a sort of `antipattern'\"); <i>United States v. Mixon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593200\"><a href=\"/opinion/593200/united-states-v-william-kirk-mixon/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">921</span></a></span>, 923 (5th Cir.1992) (in a situation in which \"[t]he government used five out of its six challenges against blacks[, t]he one black accepted by the government weakens the argument that the government was accepting jurors solely on a racial basis\").</p>\n<p>Third, the government offered apparent non-discriminatory reasons for striking potential jurors based on their voir dire answers. The defense concedes on appeal that the explanations the government provided were \"race-neutral.\" The district court accepted each explanation, either implicitly, by not soliciting an explanation and not rejecting the peremptory challenge, or explicitly, by soliciting an explanation and then not rejecting the peremptory challenge. <i>See </i><i>Girouard,</i> 521 F.3d at 115 (where defense counsel objected on religious grounds to a peremptory challenge and the district court refused to ask the prosecutor for a race-neutral explanation, we interpreted the district court's action \"as an implicit rejection of [the defendant's] prima facie case of a <i>Batson</i> violation\"). The government stated it struck Juror No. 23 because the prospective juror was an attorney. Other courts have not only permitted such peremptory challenges, but have, <i>sua sponte,</i> declared their obviousness. For example, a district court in the District of Massachusetts, without asking the prosecution to justify a strike against a prospective juror who was an attorney, stated, \"[O]ne can think of many reasons why we wouldn't want an attorney on a criminal case.\" <i>Id.</i> at 114, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111662\"><a href=\"/opinion/111662/batson-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1712</span></a></span>. The government stated it attempted to strike Juror No. 37 because the prospective juror was a member of the clergy. Other courts have permitted such peremptory challenges. For example, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit found to be race-neutral the government's peremptory challenge of an African-American prospective juror who indicated that she and her husband were ordained ministers and the government inferred that she might have a higher threshold of reasonable doubt. <i>Mixon,</i> 977 F.2d at 923. The government stated it struck Juror No. 43 because the prospective juror had a son in prison for a crime similar to the one charged against Charlton: possession of a firearm. The defense did not object to the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*54</span> peremptory challenge against Juror No. 43 at the time but cites the strike on appeal as part of the totality of the circumstances that indicate that the government intended \"to eliminate or minimize an African-American presence on the jury.\" However, other circuits have upheld similar juror dismissals. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Hendrix,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1202117\"><a href=\"/opinion/1202117/united-states-v-hendrix/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">362</span></a></span>, 370 (7th Cir.2007) (finding \"a valid and race-neutral basis for the strikes\" where prosecution exercised peremptory challenges against three jurors, all of whom had relatives in prison); <i>United States v. Crawford,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790884\"><a href=\"/opinion/790884/united-states-v-lyman-gerald-crawford/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">873</span></a></span>, 875 (8th Cir.2005) (\"There is no <i>Batson</i> violation when a juror is dismissed because the juror's relatives have been prosecuted or convicted of a crime....\").</p>\n<p>Finally, there is no evidence in the record that similarly situated jurors (attorneys, members of clergy, or relatives of convicts) from outside the allegedly targeted group of African-Americans were permitted to serve. In fact, the government was consistent when, according to the trial transcript, the only other similarly situated prospective juror, Juror No. 47, who stated she had a relative in jail for possession of a firearm, was considered as an alternate juror. As with Juror No. 43, the government exercised a peremptory challenge against this prospective (alternate) juror, offering the same explanation in the process, notwithstanding that Juror No. 47 was not African-American.</p>\n<p>Having consulted all of the circumstances that bear upon the issue of racial animosity, we conclude that Charlton failed to establish that the government purposely discriminated against African-Americans in exercising its peremptory challenge against Juror No. 23 and thus the district court committed no errorclear or plain in permitting the government's peremptory challenge against that prospective juror. Furthermore, we are not left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court made a mistake in deciding that Charlton failed to prove that the strike constituted purposeful discrimination on the basis of race. We have not determined an inherent discriminatory intent in the government's explanation for striking Juror No. 23, and so deem the reason offeredthat she was an attorney and the government did not want an attorney on the juryto be race-neutral. Thus, contrary to Charlton's contention, we glean no purpose by the government to eliminate or minimize an African-American presence on the jury.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Predicate Convictions</h2>\n<p>Charlton was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) and subsequently sentenced under the provisions of the ACCA. On appeal, Charlton argues that his Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury was violated because the government did not plead or prove beyond a reasonable doubt the requisite predicate convictions, nor did Charlton admit to those convictions. Consequently, Charlton states, his sentence must be vacated and the matter remanded for resentencing. \"We have consistently rejected this argument in light of Supreme Court precedent.\" <i>United States v. LaFortune,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203191\"><a href=\"/opinion/203191/united-states-v-lafortune/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 58 (1st Cir.2008). As discussed below, because of the Supreme Court's and our own precedent on this matter, we must uphold Charlton's sentence. <i>See </i><i>Richards,</i> 456 F.3d at 262.</p>\n<p>On appeal, Charlton acknowledges that we have characterized as \"hopeless\" claims</p>\n<blockquote>that the Fifth and Sixth Amendments precluded the district court from classifying [appellant] as an armed career criminal because (i) the indictment did not charge him as an armed career criminal and (ii) [appellant] did not admit <span class=\"star-pagination\">*55</span> nor did a jury findthat [appellant's] prior crimes qualified as predicate offenses under the ACCA.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> Charlton's characterization is accurate. \"[A] sentencing enhancement may be grounded on prior criminal convictions neither separately charged nor proven to a jury.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Almendárez-Torres,</i> 523 U.S. at 226-27, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118188\"><a href=\"/opinion/118188/almendarez-torres-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1219</span></a></span>). \"[T]his court normally is bound by a Supreme Court precedent unless and until the Court itself disavows that precedent. For that reason, we recently have rejected a parade of similarly sculpted challenges to the continuing vitality of <i>Almendárez-Torres</i> [in the context of the ACCA]. We reiterate those holdings today.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p>We conclude that the district court did not err in sentencing Charlton as an armed career criminal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We find no error in the district court's granting of the government's peremptory strike against Juror No. 23. We are bound by precedent in rejecting Charlton's ACCA claim. Charlton's conviction and the district court's sentence are thus both affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<p>LYNCH, Chief Judge, concurring.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the whole can be greater than the sum of the parts, including in <i>Batson</i> cases. I write separately to emphasize that the defendant's underlying theory is sound, though of little help to him here. Even if the prosecution offers facially neutral reasons for striking individual members of protected groups at the time of the strike, if those strikes together later create a concern that certain groups are underrepresented, it may well make sense for a trial judge to take a second look at the exclusions.</p>\n<p><i>Batson</i> and its progeny are not ultimately about statistical disparities or disparate impact; they are about animus. <i>See </i><i>Snyder v. Louisiana,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145823\"><a href=\"/opinion/145823/snyder-v-louisiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">552</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span>, 478, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145823\"><a href=\"/opinion/145823/snyder-v-louisiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Although courts may consider statistics as evidence of discrimination, <i>Miller-El,</i> 545 U.S. at 240-41, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799976\"><a href=\"/opinion/799976/miller-el-v-dretke/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Prosecutors often exercise peremptories against a series of minority jurors for valid, nondiscriminatory reasons. And no matter how many or how few minority jurors the government strikes, \"[t]he Constitution forbids striking <span class=\"star-pagination\">*56</span> even a single prospective juror for a discriminatory purpose.\" <i>Snyder,</i> 552 U.S. at 478, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145823\"><a href=\"/opinion/145823/snyder-v-louisiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Thus an explanation for a strike that seems minimally adequate at the time may look more suspect in light of later challenges. The cumulative impact of a series of peremptories is one of many facts courts can consider when interpreting a prosecutor's motives.</p>\n<p>Here, the defendant has no more than numbers, as Judge Torruella's opinion clearly explains. The other facts do not show that the government acted with animus. The government exercised two peremptories to which Charlton objects, first against an attorney and then, initially, against a clergymember. In the end, the prosecution decided, after it looked at the assembled jurors, not to strike Juror No. 37 (the clergymember), which removed any suspicion of a <i>Batson</i> violation from the case. While the defendant's case has been ably argued, there was no error.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Specifically, the grand jury charged that, \"[o]n or about July 25, 2004, in Brockton in the District of Massachusetts, ... Charlton... [,] having previously been convicted in a court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, did knowingly possess, in and affecting commerce, a firearm, to wit, a Star, Model 30M, 9mm semi[-]automatic pistol, bearing serial number 1878329.\"</p>\n<p>[2]  18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) provides:\n</p>\n<p>It shall be unlawful for any person who has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.</p>\n<p>[3]  18 U.S.C. § 924(e) provides, in part:\n</p>\n<p>In the case of a person who violates section 922(g) of this title and has three previous convictions by any court referred to in section 922(g)(1) of this title for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another, such person shall be fined under this title and imprisoned not less than fifteen years, and, notwithstanding any other provision of law, the court shall not suspend the sentence of, or grant a probationary sentence to, such person with respect to the conviction under section 922(g).</p>\n<p>[4]  The district court alternated between saying that its estimate of the number of African-Americans in the jury pool \"doesn't even count the Chinese guy and the people with Hispanic surnames\" and \"included people with Hispanic and Chinese names.\"</p>\n<p>[5]  It is unclear whether, at this point, there was one African-American remaining in the jury pool, as the defense claims, or two, as the district court and the government seemed to suggest. The relevant portion of the transcript is as follows:\n</p>\n<p>THE COURT: On the other hand, there are two [African-Americans] out there in the pool, at least right now, that I would identify that way....</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>MR. RICHARDSON:before we get to it, who else are we calling African-American that's still out there?</p>\n<p>THE COURT: It looks like there are two.</p>\n<p>MS. BYRNE: One of them is his father.</p>\n<p>THE COURT: No. There's one.</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>MR. RICHARDSON: I'm just trying to figure out who they are because if one of them is being counted as African-American and one has a son serving in prison</p>\n<p>[6]  In its appellate brief, the government refers to \"juror number 23\" as the prospective juror against which the government withdrew a peremptory challenge. Appellee's Br. at 18. However, it is clear that the government meant Juror No. 37.</p>\n\n</div>",
