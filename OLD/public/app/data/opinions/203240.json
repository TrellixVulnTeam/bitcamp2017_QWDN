The Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals (BIA) affirmed, per curiam, an Immigration Judge's (IJ's)\n\ndenial of Abdou Wehba Abdel Malek's1 claims for asylum, withholding\n\nof removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture\n\n(\"CAT\").   Malek, a native and citizen of Egypt, now petitions this\n\ncourt for a review of the BIA's denial of his claims.         We affirm.\n\n                            I.   BACKGROUND\n\n           The IJ found Malek credible.       Therefore, we relate the\n\nfacts of the case as he testified to them.\n\n           Malek legally entered the United States on January 30,\n\n2000, on a nonimmigrant visa with authorization to remain until\n\nJuly 29, 2000.   On July 31, 2000, Malek timely applied for asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and protection under the CAT.         On January\n\n22, 2004, the Department of Homeland Security commenced removal\n\nproceedings   against   Malek.    In    response,   Malek   admitted   the\n\nallegations and conceded removability as charged but argued that he\n\nis entitled to relief in the form of asylum, withholding of\n\nremoval, and protection under the CAT.\n\n           Malek, a Coptic Orthodox Christian, resided in the town\n\nof Port Said, Egypt.       Along with one of his brothers-in-law,\n\nMaurice Aziz Abdel Malek, he owned and operated a business related\n\n\n\n     1\n      Malek's wife, Amal Nasr Samaan, a native and citizen of\nEgypt, is a derivative applicant for asylum, withholding of\nremoval, and protection under the Convention Against Torture, based\non Malek's application.\n\n                                  -2-\n\fto the import and export of used automobile parts.                        Another\n\nbrother-in-law, Gamel Wehba Guirgis Atteah, worked as an employee.\n\nThe    license    that    authorized      Malek    to    operate   his   business\n\nrestricted its operations to Port Said, a free trade zone.                      In\n\nMarch 1991, five men--two of whom, Nabil Mohamed Sharan and Mohamed\n\nAtwan, Malek knew from his business affairs--came to Malek's\n\nworkplace, ostensibly to discuss business with Malek.                       Soon,\n\nhowever, the ostensible businessmen, particularly an individual\n\nnamed Radab Abu Abir, embarked on an extended discourse proposing\n\nthat Malek convert to Islam.            When Malek indicated his reluctance\n\nto do so, the men became \"very angry\" and extolled the propriety of\n\nforced conversion.\n\n              Later that month, Sharan and Atwan, this time accompanied\n\nby    Sheik   Mohamed    Abu    Abir,   returned    to   Malek's   workplace    to\n\nproselytize.       This time, Sheik Abir, Sharan, and Atwan firmly\n\nordered Malek to convert to Islam.             As an incentive, they promised\n\nto    provide    Malek   with    money    and     business   assistance    if   he\n\nconverted.      The men chided Malek that Christianity is a not a \"true\n\nreligion\" and that Islam is the only true religion. Malek, angered\n\nby their insulting and intolerant behavior, attempted to throw his\n\nunwanted guests out of his office.             They proceeded to denounce him\n\nas a \"kafir,\" which apparently means a particularly bad kind of\n\ninfidel, against whom any action is justified.               Malek interpreted\n\nthe use of this word as a death threat.\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\f           On April 11, Malek received a call from his sister, who\n\nwas hysterical.     She indicated that her husband, Atteah, had\n\nconverted to Islam.    Atteah had purportedly proceeded to instruct\n\nher to convert to Islam as well, and informed her that their\n\nchildren were now Muslim by default.          She fled to her parents'\n\nhouse, where Malek apparently lived as well.         The same day, Malek\n\nreceived another call, this time from Nabil Shaber, one of the\n\nMuslim   businessmen   who    had   visited   him   in   March.   Shaber\n\ncongratulated Malek on Atteah's conversion, and urged Malek to\n\nreconsider his prior refusals.\n\n           With the assistance of Father Raphael, a local priest,\n\nMalek endeavored to relocate his sister and her children to Tonton,\n\na nearby town.    From there, Father Raphael helped them escape to\n\nthe nation of Jordan.        On June 25, Malek, his father, and two\n\nbrothers were arrested at their home at approximately 4:00 a.m.        A\n\npolice officer indicated that Atteah had accused them of kidnaping\n\nhis wife and children and, additionally, threatening to kill him.\n\nMalek responded that he had never threatened to kill Atteah, but\n\nconceded that his sister had fled the area.         He falsely denied any\n\nknowledge of his sister's whereabouts. He was forced to promise to\n\ninform the authorities if he learned his sister's location and not\n\nto harm Atteah.   Malek and his family were released at some point\n\nbetween 6:00 and 7:00 a.m.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f            Around noon, Malek left the house to purchase food. Once\n\noutside, he was forced into a taxi by men who were apparently\n\nlurking in wait for him, taken to a nearby police station, and\n\nsearched.    The police, led by the same officer as in the morning,\n\nconfiscated his possessions and drove him to another location\n\napproximately an hour and a half distant.                    Again, the police\n\nofficer demanded to know where Malek's sister was.                    When Malek\n\nprotested his innocence, the police officers stripped off his\n\nclothes, tied his hands and legs, and hung him from a stick.                   The\n\npolice officers then beat him with another stick, which was \"very\n\npainful,\"    and     ultimately   caused      Malek    to     bleed    and   lose\n\nconsciousness. Then, the police officers doused him with water and\n\nadministered electrical shocks.\n\n            As   a   direct   result   of    this   abuse,    Malek   agreed    to\n\ncooperate.    At this point, his captors untied him and took him to\n\nanother room, where an officer stated that he was \"glad that [Malek\n\nwas] able to remember what happened to [his] sister.\"                        Malek\n\nadmitted helping his sister, with the aid of Father Raphael, escape\n\nto Jordan. He continued, however, to deny knowledge of her precise\n\nlocation.    Although Malek was then taken to his home, he was\n\ninstructed that \"severe consequences\" would occur if he told anyone\n\nabout the incident. Fearing that the police officers would divulge\n\nhis sisters' location to Atteah, Malek traveled to visit his sister\n\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fin Jordan,2 at which point he accompanied her to Syria and helped\n\nher     relocate       to    Lebanon.        He    was   absent    from    Egypt     for\n\napproximately one month.\n\n                  Upon his return to Egypt, Malek relocated his residence\n\nto Cairo from Port Said, in order to avoid future confrontations\n\nwith the police and Atteah.                  He also traveled to support his\n\nbusiness.          Because his business license was restricted to Port\n\nSaid, however, Malek had to return there periodically to fill out\n\npaperwork and conduct essential transactions.                     In September 1993,\n\ndue to continuing problems with Muslim fundamentalists, Malek and\n\nMaurice Malek dissolved their partnership.                        Thereafter, Malek\n\ncontinued to operate his business alone.\n\n                  In 1998, Atteah attempted to intercept Malek at his place\n\nof business in Port Said.               Atteah, accompanied by several other\n\nindividuals, instructed Malek to leave Port Said and \"the area.\"\n\nOn another occasion, also while Malek was doing business in Port\n\nSaid, he was attacked by a group of Muslims, including Mohamed\n\nAtwan       and    Sheik    Abir.   During    this   confrontation,       one   of   his\n\n\n\n\n        2\n      As the IJ recognized, it is unclear from the testimony\nprecisely when Malek traveled to Jordan to help his sister\nrelocate. Malek consistently testified that he only traveled to\nJordan on one occasion; nevertheless, his testimony is self-\ncontradictory and, in part, conflicted with his affidavit as to\nwhether this trip occurred before or after the beating described\nabove.   Regardless, the IJ attributed the confusion to Malek's\nnervousness as a witness, rather than any duplicitous motive, and\nfound any discrepancy to be immaterial.\n\n                                             -6-\n\fassailants cut Malek's hand, requiring stitches.             Malek, however,\n\ndid not report this incident to local authorities.\n\n            Acting on the advice and with the assistance of Father\n\nRaphael, Malek departed Egypt for Germany.               After approximately\n\nnineteen months, part of which he spent in the United States, he\n\nreturned to Egypt, married Samaan, and attempted to resume his\n\nbusiness    operations.      Yet    again,    in   January    2000,    Atteah,\n\naccompanied by two other individuals, forced his way inside Malek's\n\nbusiness office in Port Said.         Atteah threatened Malek, stating\n\n\"this is the last day in your life.\"         One of his associates accused\n\nMalek of being an infidel.         While Atteah and one of the men beat\n\nMalek, the other assailant began to break \"everything\" in the\n\noffice.    A friendly neighbor helped Malek extract himself from the\n\noffice and called the police, who arrived about twenty-five minutes\n\nlater.    The police, however, refused to report the incident after\n\nlearning   that   the   alleged    perpetrator     was   Atteah,   a   Muslim.\n\nNonetheless, Malek was able to fill out a complaint at the district\n\nattorney's office.3       With Father Raphael's assistance, Malek and\n\nSamaan,4 now pregnant, fled to Cairo and then to the United States.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      The complaint was later dismissed due to Malek's absence from\nthe country.\n     4\n      Apparently, Samaan spent time in both Cairo, where she was a\nstudent, and at Malek's family residence in Port Said.\n\n                                     -7-\n\f                                II.   ANALYSIS\n\n           We uphold factual determinations of the BIA if \"supported\n\nby reasonable, substantial and probative evidence on the record\n\nconsidered as a whole.\"        Attia v. Gonzales, 477 F.3d 21, 23 (1st\n\nCir. 2007) (per curiam) (quoting Carcamo-Recinos v. Ashcroft, 389\n\nF.3d 253, 256 (1st Cir. 2004)).             \"This so-called 'substantial\n\nevidence' standard applies to claims for asylum, withholding of\n\nremoval, and relief under the CAT.\"         Sharari v. Gonzales, 407 F.3d\n\n467, 473 (1st Cir. 2005) (citing Settenda v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 89,\n\n93 (1st Cir. 2004)).      Under this highly deferential standard, a\n\ndetermination   will     not    be    reversed   unless   \"any   reasonable\n\nadjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\"             8\n\nU.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B).        \"Merely identifying alternative findings\n\nthat could be supported by substantial evidence is insufficient to\n\nsupplant the BIA’s findings.\"         Albathani v. INS, 318 F.3d 365, 372\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).       Rather, \"the record must compel the contrary\n\nconclusion.\" López de Hincapie v. Gonzales, 494 F.3d 213, 218 (1st\n\nCir. 2007). Conversely, we review de novo the legal conclusions of\n\nthe BIA.   Wang v. Mukasey, 508 F.3d 80, 83-84 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\nWhere, as here, \"the BIA adopts an IJ's decision, we review the\n\nrelevant portion of the IJ's opinion as though it were the decision\n\nof the BIA.\"    Guillaume v. Gonzales, 504 F.3d 68, 72 (1st Cir.\n\n2007).\n\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\f            The petitioner bears the burden of proof to establish\n\neligibility for asylum. Bocova v. Gonzales, 412 F.3d 257, 262 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).    To meet this burden, a petitioner ordinarily must not\n\nonly show that he subjectively fears future persecution, but also\n\nadduce credible and specific evidence that this fear is reasonable.\n\nJournal v. Keisler, 507 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir. 2007) (citation\n\nomitted).      A petitioner may satisfy the subjective component\n\nthrough his own credible testimony.             See Makhoul v. Ashcroft, 387\n\nF.3d 75, 80-81 (1st Cir. 2004). To demonstrate that his subjective\n\nfear is objectively reasonable, a petitioner must present evidence\n\nshowing either (1) that if returned he will be singled out for\n\npersecution;    or   (2)   that   there    is    a   pattern    or   practice   of\n\npersecuting a similarly situated group of persons on account of a\n\nprotected ground in his country of origin.                     See Pieterson v.\n\nAshcroft, 364 F.3d 38, 43-44 (1st Cir. 2004); accord 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 208.13(b)(2).      Alternatively, a petitioner who demonstrates past\n\npersecution creates a rebuttable presumption that his fear of\n\nfuture persecution, if repatriated, is well-founded.                  See Tobon-\n\nMarin v. Mukasey, 512 F.3d 28, 31 (1st Cir. 2008); accord 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 208.13(b)(1).\n\nA.   Asylum\n\n            Here, the IJ found that the harm inflicted upon Malek did\n\nnot amount to persecution and, in any event, that such acts were\n\nnot perpetrated on account of a protected ground.               The Immigration\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fand Nationality Act does not define \"persecution.\"                 See Negeya v.\n\nGonzales, 417 F.3d 79, 83 (1st Cir. 2005).             Thus, we have taken a\n\ncase-by-case approach to determine whether the injuries suffered by\n\na particular petitioner amount to persecution under the statute.\n\nId.    In deciding whether specific facts arise to the level of\n\npersecution, relevant factors include the \"severity, duration, and\n\nfrequency of physical abuse.\"         Topalli v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 128,\n\n133   (1st   Cir.   2005).     We   have     noted   that    \"[t]o   qualify   as\n\npersecution, a person's experience must rise above unpleasantness,\n\nharassment, and even basic suffering.\" Jorgji v. Mukasey, 514 F.3d\n\n53, 57 (1st Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting\n\nNelson v. INS, 232 F.3d 258, 263 (1st Cir. 2000)).                 Additionally,\n\na petitioner must show that the state participated in or at least\n\nacquiesced in the alleged acts of persecution.               Id.\n\n             We   assume   arguendo   that    Malek    has   experienced    past\n\npersecution.      Even the IJ described the June 25 incident--which\n\ninvolved an abduction, severe restraint, beatings, a loss of\n\nconsciousness, and electrical shocks, all at the hands of the\n\npolice--as \"torture.\"\n\n             Moreover, we note our skepticism regarding the IJ's\n\nconclusion that the alleged acts of persecution were exclusively\n\nattributable to Malek's decision to aid his sister's escape from\n\nEgypt, rather than his Christian faith.              On these facts, it seems\n\nthat the assistance Malek rendered to his sister is inextricably\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fintertwined with Malek's religious beliefs and the pressures that\n\nwere placed on Malek, Maurice Malek, Malek's sister and Atteah, who\n\nsuccumbed,    to     convert      to   Islam.        If    not    for    the   underlying\n\nreligious antagonism, the alleged persecution would never have\n\ntaken place.       We are doubtful that Malek's actions in support of\n\nhis sister can be parsed so neatly from the underlying religious\n\nmotivations     of    both     Malek    and     his       alleged      persecutors.       A\n\npetitioner need not show that persecution occurred or will occur\n\nsolely   on     account      of    a   protected          ground.        See    8     U.S.C.\n\n§ 1158(b)(1)(B)(i) (requiring applicants for asylum to show that\n\nmembership in a protected category \"was or will be at least one\n\ncentral reason\" for past or future persecution (emphasis added));\n\naccord   Vumi    v.    Gonzales,       502    F.3d    150,       159    (2d    Cir.   2007)\n\n(explaining that, even where the petitioner was detained for a\n\nlegitimate reason, an IJ should employ a mixed-motive analysis in\n\nlight of the nature and severity of the interrogation).                               Here,\n\nwhere Malek was abducted from his home and subjected to what the IJ\n\ndescribed as torture, it is questionable whether the police were\n\nmotivated by legitimate law enforcement concerns, rather than the\n\nunderlying religious conflict.               See id. (recognizing the inherent\n\ndifficulty of \"determining whether harm was inflicted because of\n\nthe applicant's acts or because of his beliefs underlying those\n\nacts\" (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting In re S-P-, 21\n\nI.&N. Dec. 486, 498 (BIA 1996))).\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\f            Nevertheless, substantial evidence supports the IJ's\n\ndetermination that it would be reasonable for Malek to avoid future\n\npersecution by relocating away from Port Said.              See Tendean v.\n\nGonzales, 503 F.3d 8, 11 (1st Cir. 2007) (explaining that \"the\n\npossibility of internal relocation negates any presumption of\n\neligibility . . . based on past persecution\"); accord 8 C.F.R.\n\n§§   1208.13(b)(1)(i)(B),    1208.13(b)(3).        The   alleged   acts    of\n\npersecution detailed by Malek occurred exclusively in Port Said.\n\nIn   this   case,   the   possibility    of    relocation   is   more   than\n\nhypothetical--Malek actually did relocate to Cairo, where he was\n\nnot disturbed by Atteah or anyone else.              We acknowledge that\n\nMalek's relocation will entail some hardship,5 as his business\n\nlicense is restricted to Port Said.           Such a difficulty, however,\n\nwas noted and rejected by the IJ, who explained that \"there is no\n\nright under the asylum laws to engage in a particular business\";\n\nand that Malek did not show that he could not \"provide[] for his\n\nfamily through another career in Cairo.\"          In these circumstances,\n\nthe IJ was not compelled to arrive at a different conclusion.             See\n\nTendean, 503 F.3d at 11 (applying substantial evidence standard to\n\nan IJ's findings concerning the reasonableness of relocation).\n\n            Similarly, the IJ did not err by concluding that Malek\n\nfailed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution. The\n\n\n      5\n      We likewise reject his contention, discussed more fully\nbelow, that he will be subjected to persecution in any location in\nEgypt.\n\n                                  -12-\n\fIJ did not fully explain the basis for her decision; given that the\n\nIJ found Malek credible, we assume arguendo that she credited\n\nMalek's assertion that he fears persecution if returned to Egypt,\n\nthus     satisfying   the   subjective   component.       Nevertheless,\n\nsubstantial evidence supports the IJ's implied determination that\n\nMalek lacked an objective basis for fearing future persecution in\n\nEgypt.\n\n            We are troubled by the IJ's failure to discuss the\n\nsubstantial documentary evidence regarding conditions in Egypt,\n\nwhich Malek claims provides an objective basis for his fear of\n\nfuture persecution.     Coptic Christians clearly face considerable\n\nunpleasantness stemming from their religious beliefs.         Moreover,\n\nthe most recent State Department reports in evidence--the 2004\n\nCountry Report for Egypt and 2004 International Religious Freedom\n\nReport     for   Egypt--suggest   that   the   Egyptian    government,\n\nparticularly at the local level, is not always responsive to the\n\nwrongs inflicted upon Coptic Christians by the Muslim majority.\n\nIndeed, the reports indicate that the local police may actually\n\nengage in and facilitate religious persecution to some extent.\n\nFinally, the reports reveal that certain of Egypt's laws appear to\n\nlack religious neutrality; to point to an example implicated by the\n\ninstant facts, the minor children of a convert to Islam are\n\nautomatically classified as Muslims as well, regardless of the\n\nreligious persuasion of the spouse and children.\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\f              Nevertheless, \"[w]hen considering whether the clarity of\n\nan administrative decision is sufficient to support our review\n\n. . ., we are not blind to the context in which the decision is\n\nmade or oblivious of the record on which it is based.\"                    Xu v.\n\nGonzales, 424 F.3d 45, 49 (1st Cir. 2005).            In the hearings before\n\nthe IJ, Malek relied almost exclusively on a theory of past\n\npersecution. When asked why he could not simply relocate to Cairo,\n\nhe replied, \"I don't know anything in Cairo and I don't have any\n\nbusiness in Cairo.      My business was based on the free trade zone of\n\nPort Said.\"      Malek conceded that he was never harassed while in\n\nCairo--he did not, as he does now in his brief, expound upon the\n\nsorry state of Coptic Christians throughout Egypt.               Additionally,\n\nMalek   did    not   even   seek   to   introduce   the   most   recent   State\n\nDepartment reports into evidence--at the conclusion of the hearing,\n\nthe IJ requested that one of the litigants provide her with the\n\nmost recent reports. At that point, the government's attorney, not\n\nMalek, submitted the 2004 reports.             Thus, it is unsurprising that\n\nthe IJ did not focus on a nascent pattern or practice theory in\n\nconsidering whether Malek had a well-founded fear of persecution,\n\ngiven the issue's lack of prominence in the actual conduct of the\n\nproceedings, despite the voluminous record.\n\n              An IJ's duty to expound upon his or her reasons for\n\nrejecting a particular argument is concomitant with a litigant's\n\nactual articulation of that argument.            Malek may have subjectively\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\ffeared renewed conflict with Atteah.   This problem, however, could\n\nseemingly be avoided if Malek relocated within Egypt.    Malek did\n\nnot indicate that he is fearful of the general conditions within\n\nEgypt. Thus, there is a disconnect between Malek's subjective fear\n\nof persecution and the objective evidence of country conditions in\n\nEgypt.   The IJ provided an extensive, individualized analysis of\n\nMalek's experiences with Atteah and the Muslim fundamentalists in\n\nPort Said; more was not required because Malek failed to urge a\n\npattern or practice theory either through his testimony or the oral\n\nargument of counsel.6\n\n          Moreover, the IJ's opinion contains sufficient references\n\nto countrywide conditions to lead us to believe that she considered\n\nbut rejected a pattern or practice theory.       See Rotinsulu v.\n\nMukasey, 515 F.3d 68, 72-73 (1st Cir. 2008) (explaining that an\n\nIJ's findings may be either implicit or explicit).     The IJ held\n\nthat \"the harm inflicted on the respondent by his brother-in-law\n\ndoes not constitute persecution,\" in part, because such conditions\n\n\n\n     6\n      We note that Malek did assert a pattern or practice theory\nbefore the BIA. Because we hold that the IJ did, if implicitly,\nreject Malek's evidence of country conditions, we need not\ndetermine the extent to which the BIA should have considered an\nargument developed largely on appeal.       See Pinos-Gonzalez v.\nMukasey, ___ F.3d ___, 2008 WL 583677, at *2-3 (8th Cir. Mar. 5,\n2008)(enforcing procedural bar imposed by BIA where petitioner\nfailed to first articulate an argument before the IJ); De la Cruz\nv. Mauer, 483 F.3d 1013, 1022-23 (10th Cir. 2007) (same). But see\nZhong v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 480 F.3d 104, 118-19 (2d Cir. 2007)\n(indicating exhaustion of issues, as opposed to claims for relief,\nto be an affirmative defense subject to waiver where not urged).\n\n                               -15-\n\f\"[did] not exist on a countrywide basis.\"                           While the related\n\ndiscussion pertained to the specific threat posed by Atteah, the IJ\n\nclearly contemplated conditions throughout Egypt.                        Additionally,\n\nthe IJ determined that requiring Malek to relocate within Egypt\n\nwould not be \"unreasonable,\" a conclusion that could only be\n\njustified       if    the    IJ     determined    that      Malek    would    not    face\n\npersecution outside of Port Said.                    Indeed, we note that the IJ\n\naddressed       the    one    explicit       concern     that    Malek       articulated\n\nconcerning relocation within Egypt, dismissing the inconvenience\n\nthat    Malek    might       face    given    that    his    business     license     was\n\nrestricted to Port Said.             Finally, we cannot ignore the fact that\n\nthe IJ, not Malek, requested sua sponte the submission of the 2004\n\nState    Department          reports;    it      seems      unlikely    that,       having\n\nspecifically solicited the introduction of these documents, the IJ\n\nwould have ignored them in rendering her decision.                             In these\n\ncircumstances, we are satisfied that the IJ's decision contemplated\n\ncountry conditions throughout Egypt--\"[w]e do not require an IJ to\n\nintone any magic words before we will review her determination.\"\n\nSulaiman v. Gonzales, 429 F.3d 347, 351 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            In the past, we have noted that \"[t]he obligation to\n\nexplain and articulate depends importantly on the strength of the\n\nposition being urged.             Where no plausible reason is offered for a\n\nrequest, the word 'no' is plainly sufficient.\"                      Karim v. Gonzales,\n\n424 F.3d 109, 111 (1st              Cir. 2005).      Moreover, in any context, a\n\n\n                                          -16-\n\flitigant \"cannot switch horses midstream in hopes of locating a\n\nswifter steed.\"      United States v. Lilly, 13 F.3d 15, 18 (1st Cir.\n\n1994) (citation omitted).           Essentially, Malek now seeks relief\n\nbased on an argument that he presented, if at all, in a threadbare,\n\nconclusory fashion before the IJ.         We will not, on appeal, reverse\n\nthe decision of the IJ for failing to make Malek's arguments for\n\nhim.\n\nB.   Withholding of Removal and Protection Under the CAT\n\n           We likewise reject Malek's claims for withholding of\n\nremoval and protection under the CAT.                Because Malek has not\n\nsatisfied the more lenient standard for asylum, a fortiori he\n\ncannot satisfy the higher burden for withholding of removal.\n\nSegran v. Mukasey, 511 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2007).              Even if not\n\nwaived, his claim for protection under the CAT fails on the merits.\n\n\"An applicant claiming protection under the CAT bears the burden of\n\nestablishing that 'it is more likely than not that he or she would\n\nbe   tortured   if   removed   to   the   proposed    country.'\"   Hana   v.\n\nGonzales, 503 F.3d 39, 44 (1st Cir. 2007) (quoting 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1208.16(c)(2)).      No record evidence supports the notion it is\n\nmore likely than not that Malek would be tortured if returned to\n\nEgypt.    While the IJ accepted Malek's testimony that he was\n\ntortured by the Egyptian government on a single occasion in 1991,\n\nno evidence suggests that he is likely to be tortured in the\n\n\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\ffuture.   At the very least, the IJ's conclusion in this regard is\n\nsupported by substantial evidence.\n\n                         III.   CONCLUSION\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we deny Malek's petition for\n\nreview.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -18-\n\f",

The Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals (BIA) affirmed, per curiam, an Immigration Judge's (IJ's)\n\ndenial of Abdou Wehba Abdel Malek's1 claims for asylum, withholding\n\nof removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture\n\n(\"CAT\").   Malek, a native and citizen of Egypt, now petitions this\n\ncourt for a review of the BIA's denial of his claims.         We affirm.\n\n                            I.   BACKGROUND\n\n           The IJ found Malek credible.       Therefore, we relate the\n\nfacts of the case as he testified to them.\n\n           Malek legally entered the United States on January 30,\n\n2000, on a nonimmigrant visa with authorization to remain until\n\nJuly 29, 2000.   On July 31, 2000, Malek timely applied for asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and protection under the CAT.         On January\n\n22, 2004, the Department of Homeland Security commenced removal\n\nproceedings   against   Malek.    In    response,   Malek   admitted   the\n\nallegations and conceded removability as charged but argued that he\n\nis entitled to relief in the form of asylum, withholding of\n\nremoval, and protection under the CAT.\n\n           Malek, a Coptic Orthodox Christian, resided in the town\n\nof Port Said, Egypt.       Along with one of his brothers-in-law,\n\nMaurice Aziz Abdel Malek, he owned and operated a business related\n\n\n\n     1\n      Malek's wife, Amal Nasr Samaan, a native and citizen of\nEgypt, is a derivative applicant for asylum, withholding of\nremoval, and protection under the Convention Against Torture, based\non Malek's application.\n\n                                  -2-\n\fto the import and export of used automobile parts.                        Another\n\nbrother-in-law, Gamel Wehba Guirgis Atteah, worked as an employee.\n\nThe    license    that    authorized      Malek    to    operate   his   business\n\nrestricted its operations to Port Said, a free trade zone.                      In\n\nMarch 1991, five men--two of whom, Nabil Mohamed Sharan and Mohamed\n\nAtwan, Malek knew from his business affairs--came to Malek's\n\nworkplace, ostensibly to discuss business with Malek.                       Soon,\n\nhowever, the ostensible businessmen, particularly an individual\n\nnamed Radab Abu Abir, embarked on an extended discourse proposing\n\nthat Malek convert to Islam.            When Malek indicated his reluctance\n\nto do so, the men became \"very angry\" and extolled the propriety of\n\nforced conversion.\n\n              Later that month, Sharan and Atwan, this time accompanied\n\nby    Sheik   Mohamed    Abu    Abir,   returned    to   Malek's   workplace    to\n\nproselytize.       This time, Sheik Abir, Sharan, and Atwan firmly\n\nordered Malek to convert to Islam.             As an incentive, they promised\n\nto    provide    Malek   with    money    and     business   assistance    if   he\n\nconverted.      The men chided Malek that Christianity is a not a \"true\n\nreligion\" and that Islam is the only true religion. Malek, angered\n\nby their insulting and intolerant behavior, attempted to throw his\n\nunwanted guests out of his office.             They proceeded to denounce him\n\nas a \"kafir,\" which apparently means a particularly bad kind of\n\ninfidel, against whom any action is justified.               Malek interpreted\n\nthe use of this word as a death threat.\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\f           On April 11, Malek received a call from his sister, who\n\nwas hysterical.     She indicated that her husband, Atteah, had\n\nconverted to Islam.    Atteah had purportedly proceeded to instruct\n\nher to convert to Islam as well, and informed her that their\n\nchildren were now Muslim by default.          She fled to her parents'\n\nhouse, where Malek apparently lived as well.         The same day, Malek\n\nreceived another call, this time from Nabil Shaber, one of the\n\nMuslim   businessmen   who    had   visited   him   in   March.   Shaber\n\ncongratulated Malek on Atteah's conversion, and urged Malek to\n\nreconsider his prior refusals.\n\n           With the assistance of Father Raphael, a local priest,\n\nMalek endeavored to relocate his sister and her children to Tonton,\n\na nearby town.    From there, Father Raphael helped them escape to\n\nthe nation of Jordan.        On June 25, Malek, his father, and two\n\nbrothers were arrested at their home at approximately 4:00 a.m.        A\n\npolice officer indicated that Atteah had accused them of kidnaping\n\nhis wife and children and, additionally, threatening to kill him.\n\nMalek responded that he had never threatened to kill Atteah, but\n\nconceded that his sister had fled the area.         He falsely denied any\n\nknowledge of his sister's whereabouts. He was forced to promise to\n\ninform the authorities if he learned his sister's location and not\n\nto harm Atteah.   Malek and his family were released at some point\n\nbetween 6:00 and 7:00 a.m.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f            Around noon, Malek left the house to purchase food. Once\n\noutside, he was forced into a taxi by men who were apparently\n\nlurking in wait for him, taken to a nearby police station, and\n\nsearched.    The police, led by the same officer as in the morning,\n\nconfiscated his possessions and drove him to another location\n\napproximately an hour and a half distant.                    Again, the police\n\nofficer demanded to know where Malek's sister was.                    When Malek\n\nprotested his innocence, the police officers stripped off his\n\nclothes, tied his hands and legs, and hung him from a stick.                   The\n\npolice officers then beat him with another stick, which was \"very\n\npainful,\"    and     ultimately   caused      Malek    to     bleed    and   lose\n\nconsciousness. Then, the police officers doused him with water and\n\nadministered electrical shocks.\n\n            As   a   direct   result   of    this   abuse,    Malek   agreed    to\n\ncooperate.    At this point, his captors untied him and took him to\n\nanother room, where an officer stated that he was \"glad that [Malek\n\nwas] able to remember what happened to [his] sister.\"                        Malek\n\nadmitted helping his sister, with the aid of Father Raphael, escape\n\nto Jordan. He continued, however, to deny knowledge of her precise\n\nlocation.    Although Malek was then taken to his home, he was\n\ninstructed that \"severe consequences\" would occur if he told anyone\n\nabout the incident. Fearing that the police officers would divulge\n\nhis sisters' location to Atteah, Malek traveled to visit his sister\n\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fin Jordan,2 at which point he accompanied her to Syria and helped\n\nher     relocate       to    Lebanon.        He    was   absent    from    Egypt     for\n\napproximately one month.\n\n                  Upon his return to Egypt, Malek relocated his residence\n\nto Cairo from Port Said, in order to avoid future confrontations\n\nwith the police and Atteah.                  He also traveled to support his\n\nbusiness.          Because his business license was restricted to Port\n\nSaid, however, Malek had to return there periodically to fill out\n\npaperwork and conduct essential transactions.                     In September 1993,\n\ndue to continuing problems with Muslim fundamentalists, Malek and\n\nMaurice Malek dissolved their partnership.                        Thereafter, Malek\n\ncontinued to operate his business alone.\n\n                  In 1998, Atteah attempted to intercept Malek at his place\n\nof business in Port Said.               Atteah, accompanied by several other\n\nindividuals, instructed Malek to leave Port Said and \"the area.\"\n\nOn another occasion, also while Malek was doing business in Port\n\nSaid, he was attacked by a group of Muslims, including Mohamed\n\nAtwan       and    Sheik    Abir.   During    this   confrontation,       one   of   his\n\n\n\n\n        2\n      As the IJ recognized, it is unclear from the testimony\nprecisely when Malek traveled to Jordan to help his sister\nrelocate. Malek consistently testified that he only traveled to\nJordan on one occasion; nevertheless, his testimony is self-\ncontradictory and, in part, conflicted with his affidavit as to\nwhether this trip occurred before or after the beating described\nabove.   Regardless, the IJ attributed the confusion to Malek's\nnervousness as a witness, rather than any duplicitous motive, and\nfound any discrepancy to be immaterial.\n\n                                             -6-\n\fassailants cut Malek's hand, requiring stitches.             Malek, however,\n\ndid not report this incident to local authorities.\n\n            Acting on the advice and with the assistance of Father\n\nRaphael, Malek departed Egypt for Germany.               After approximately\n\nnineteen months, part of which he spent in the United States, he\n\nreturned to Egypt, married Samaan, and attempted to resume his\n\nbusiness    operations.      Yet    again,    in   January    2000,    Atteah,\n\naccompanied by two other individuals, forced his way inside Malek's\n\nbusiness office in Port Said.         Atteah threatened Malek, stating\n\n\"this is the last day in your life.\"         One of his associates accused\n\nMalek of being an infidel.

Even the IJ described the June 25 incident--which\n\ninvolved an abduction, severe restraint, beatings, a loss of\n\nconsciousness, and electrical shocks, all at the hands of the\n\npolice--as \"torture.\"\n\n             Moreover, we note our skepticism regarding the IJ's\n\nconclusion that the alleged acts of persecution were exclusively\n\nattributable to Malek's decision to aid his sister's escape from\n\nEgypt, rather than his Christian faith.              On these facts, it seems\n\nthat the assistance Malek rendered to his sister is inextricably\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fintertwined with Malek's religious beliefs and the pressures that\n\nwere placed on Malek, Maurice Malek, Malek's sister and Atteah, who\n\nsuccumbed,    to     convert      to   Islam.        If    not    for    the   underlying\n\nreligious antagonism, the alleged persecution would never have\n\ntaken place.       We are doubtful that Malek's actions in support of\n\nhis sister can be parsed so neatly from the underlying religious\n\nmotivations     of    both     Malek    and     his       alleged      persecutors.

Here,\n\nwhere Malek was abducted from his home and subjected to what the IJ\n\ndescribed as torture, it is questionable whether the police were\n\nmotivated by legitimate law enforcement concerns, rather than the\n\nunderlying religious conflict.

The   alleged   acts    of\n\npersecution detailed by Malek occurred exclusively in Port Said.\n\nIn   this   case,   the   possibility    of    relocation   is   more   than\n\nhypothetical--Malek actually did relocate to Cairo, where he was\n\nnot disturbed by Atteah or anyone else.              We acknowledge that\n\nMalek's relocation will entail some hardship,5 as his business\n\nlicense is restricted to Port Said.           Such a difficulty, however,\n\nwas noted and rejected by the IJ, who explained that \"there is no\n\nright under the asylum laws to engage in a particular business\";\n\nand that Malek did not show that he could not \"provide[] for his\n\nfamily through another career in Cairo.\"          In these circumstances,\n\nthe IJ was not compelled to arrive at a different conclusion.             See\n\nTendean, 503 F.3d at 11 (applying substantial evidence standard to\n\nan IJ's findings concerning the reasonableness of relocation).\n\n            Similarly, the IJ did not err by concluding that Malek\n\nfailed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution. The\n\n\n      5\n      We likewise reject his contention, discussed more fully\nbelow, that he will be subjected to persecution in any location in\nEgypt.\n\n                                  -12-\n\fIJ did not fully explain the basis for her decision; given that the\n\nIJ found Malek credible, we assume arguendo that she credited\n\nMalek's assertion that he fears persecution if returned to Egypt,\n\nthus     satisfying   the   subjective   component.       Nevertheless,\n\nsubstantial evidence supports the IJ's implied determination that\n\nMalek lacked an objective basis for fearing future persecution in\n\nEgypt.\n\n            We are troubled by the IJ's failure to discuss the\n\nsubstantial documentary evidence regarding conditions in Egypt,\n\nwhich Malek claims provides an objective basis for his fear of\n\nfuture persecution.     Coptic Christians clearly face considerable\n\nunpleasantness stemming from their religious beliefs.         Moreover,\n\nthe most recent State Department reports in evidence--the 2004\n\nCountry Report for Egypt and 2004 International Religious Freedom\n\nReport     for   Egypt--suggest   that   the   Egyptian    government,\n\nparticularly at the local level, is not always responsive to the\n\nwrongs inflicted upon Coptic Christians by the Muslim majority.\n\nIndeed, the reports indicate that the local police may actually\n\nengage in and facilitate religious persecution to some extent.\n\nFinally, the reports reveal that certain of Egypt's laws appear to\n\nlack religious neutrality; to point to an example implicated by the\n\ninstant facts, the minor children of a convert to Islam are\n\nautomatically classified as Muslims as well, regardless of the\n\nreligious persuasion of the spouse and children.\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\f              Nevertheless, \"[w]hen considering whether the clarity of\n\nan administrative decision is sufficient to support our review\n\n. . ., we are not blind to the context in which the decision is\n\nmade or oblivious of the record on which it is based.\"                    Xu v.\n\nGonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201828\"><a href=\"/opinion/201828/xu-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 49 (1st Cir. 2005).            In the hearings before\n\nthe IJ, Malek relied almost exclusively on a theory of past\n\npersecution. When asked why he could not simply relocate to Cairo,\n\nhe replied, \"I don't know anything in Cairo and I don't have any\n\nbusiness in Cairo.      My business was based on the free trade zone of\n\nPort Said.\"      Malek conceded that he was never harassed while in\n\nCairo--he did not, as he does now in his brief, expound upon the\n\nsorry state of Coptic Christians throughout Egypt.               Additionally,\n\nMalek   did    not   even   seek   to   introduce   the   most   recent   State\n\nDepartment reports into evidence--at the conclusion of the hearing,\n\nthe IJ requested that one of the litigants provide her with the\n\nmost recent reports. At that point, the government's attorney, not\n\nMalek, submitted the 2004 reports.             Thus, it is unsurprising that\n\nthe IJ did not focus on a nascent pattern or practice theory in\n\nconsidering whether Malek had a well-founded fear of persecution,\n\ngiven the issue's lack of prominence in the actual conduct of the\n\nproceedings, despite the voluminous record.\n\n              An IJ's duty to expound upon his or her reasons for\n\nrejecting a particular argument is concomitant with a litigant's\n\nactual articulation of that argument.            Malek may have subjectively\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\ffeared renewed conflict with Atteah.   This problem, however, could\n\nseemingly be avoided if Malek relocated within Egypt.    Malek did\n\nnot indicate that he is fearful of the general conditions within\n\nEgypt. Thus, there is a disconnect between Malek's subjective fear\n\nof persecution and the objective evidence of country conditions in\n\nEgypt.   The IJ provided an extensive, individualized analysis of\n\nMalek's experiences with Atteah and the Muslim fundamentalists in\n\nPort Said; more was not required because Malek failed to urge a\n\npattern or practice theory either through his testimony or the oral\n\nargument of counsel.6\n\n          Moreover, the IJ's opinion contains sufficient references\n\nto countrywide conditions to lead us to believe that she considered\n\nbut rejected a pattern or practice theory.

Indeed, we note that the IJ\n\naddressed       the    one    explicit       concern     that    Malek       articulated\n\nconcerning relocation within Egypt, dismissing the inconvenience\n\nthat    Malek    might       face    given    that    his    business     license     was\n\nrestricted to Port Said.

Moreover, in any context, a\n\n\n                                          -16-\n\flitigant \"cannot switch horses midstream in hopes of locating a\n\nswifter steed.\"      United States v.

Essentially, Malek now seeks relief\n\nbased on an argument that he presented, if at all, in a threadbare,\n\nconclusory fashion before the IJ.         We will not, on appeal, reverse\n\nthe decision of the IJ for failing to make Malek's arguments for\n\nhim.\n\nB.   Withholding of Removal and Protection Under the CAT\n\n           We likewise reject Malek's claims for withholding of\n\nremoval and protection under the CAT.                Because Malek has not\n\nsatisfied the more lenient standard for asylum, a fortiori he\n\ncannot satisfy the higher burden for withholding of removal.\n\nSegran v. Mukasey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1194474\"><a href=\"/opinion/1194474/segran-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 7 (1st Cir. 2007).              Even if not\n\nwaived, his claim for protection under the CAT fails on the merits.\n\n\"An applicant claiming protection under the CAT bears the burden of\n\nestablishing that 'it is more likely than not that he or she would\n\nbe   tortured   if   removed   to   the   proposed    country.'\"   Hana   v.\n\nGonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202941\"><a href=\"/opinion/202941/hana-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 44 (1st Cir. 2007) (quoting 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1208.16(c)(2)).      No record evidence supports the notion it is\n\nmore likely than not that Malek would be tortured if returned to\n\nEgypt.    While the IJ accepted Malek's testimony that he was\n\ntortured by the Egyptian government on a single occasion in 1991,\n\nno evidence suggests that he is likely to be tortured in the\n\n\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\ffuture.   At the very least, the IJ's conclusion in this regard is\n\nsupported by substantial evidence.\n\n                         III.   CONCLUSION\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we deny Malek's petition for\n\nreview.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -18-\n\f</pre>",
