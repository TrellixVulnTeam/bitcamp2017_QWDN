Petitioner, Budi Irawan, is a twenty-seven-\n\nyear-old citizen of Banyuwangi, Indonesia, who entered the United\n\nStates      on    February     4,     2001,   as    a   non-immigrant      visitor    for\n\npleasure.        He remained in the United States after his visa expired\n\non   August       3,   2001,    and    was    detained       by   the   Immigration   and\n\nNaturalization Service, now part of the Department of Homeland\n\nSecurity, on June 20, 2002, for violating 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)\n\n(West Supp. 2004).             Prior to his removal hearing, the Petitioner\n\nconceded that he was subject to removal, and the Immigration Judge\n\n(“IJ”) ordered his return to Indonesia.                      The Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals (“BIA”) adopted the IJ’s opinion, in which the IJ found\n\nthat       omissions    and     inconsistencies         in    Petitioner’s    testimony\n\nrendered incredible his claim that he would face an objective\n\nthreat of persecution or torture justifying withholding of removal.\n\n                 Petitioner appeals the BIA’s dismissal of his application\n\nfor asylum under 8 U.S.C. § 1158 (2000), withholding of removal\n\nunder 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3) (2000), and withholding of removal\n\nunder the Convention Against Torture (the “Convention”).1                              We\n\naffirm the judgment of the BIA.\n\n                                              I.\n\n                 Because the BIA adopted the IJ’s decision, we review the\n\n\n       1\n      The Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or\nDegrading Treatment or Punishment, Dec. 10, 1984, 1465 U.N.T.S. 85,\nwas implemented by the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act\nof 1998, Pub.

Hernandez-Barrera v.\n\nAshcroft,    373    F.3d   9,   20   (1st   Cir.   2004).       The   factual\n\ndeterminations of the BIA’s adopted decision may be overturned only\n\nif “any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to\n\nthe   contrary.”       8   U.S.C.    §   1252(b)(4)(B)      (2000).    Legal\n\ndeterminations of the BIA are reviewed de novo, but with some\n\ndeference to the BIA’s interpretation of the INA.               Da Silva v.\n\nAshcroft, 394 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                                     II.\n\n            Absent changed or extraordinary circumstances, a foreign\n\nnational may not apply for asylum more than one year after arriving\n\nin the United States.           8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B).         Petitioner\n\nconcedes that he did not file a claim for asylum within one year\n\nafter his arrival in the United States.        The IJ advised Petitioner\n\nthat his application for asylum would not be accepted without a\n\nspecial motion showing why he failed to apply within one year of\n\nhis arrival.       The IJ found that no such motion was filed, and\n\ntherefore    dismissed      Petitioner’s     application.         8   U.S.C.\n\n§ 1158(a)(3) provides that “[n]o court shall have jurisdiction to\n\nreview any determination of the Attorney General under paragraph\n\n[(a)](2),” which includes the IJ’s determination regarding the\n\ntimeliness of Petitioner’s asylum application and the existence of\n\nchanged or extraordinary circumstances justifying waiver of the\n\none-year time limitation.         We lack jurisdiction to review this\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fdetermination and therefore do not consider Petitioner’s claim for\n\nasylum under 8 U.S.C. § 1158.      Sharari v. Gonzales, 407 F.3d 467,\n\n473 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                                  III.\n\n           An otherwise removable non-citizen may avoid removal to\n\na country by showing that it is more likely than not that his “life\n\nor freedom would be threatened in that country because of [his]\n\nrace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social\n\ngroup, or political opinion.”     8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A).          The non-\n\ncitizen has the burden of persuasion to “show either that (i) he\n\nhas suffered past persecution on account of one of the five\n\nprotected grounds (thus creating a rebuttable presumption that he\n\nmay suffer future persecution), or (ii) it is more likely than not\n\nthat he will be persecuted on account of a protected ground upon\n\nhis return to his native land.”          Da Silva, 394 F.3d at 4; see 8\n\nC.F.R. § 208.16(b) (2005).\n\n           Petitioner claims he is the victim of past persecution in\n\nthe form of harassment of himself and the murder of two family\n\nmembers.    Specifically,    he   alleges    that   he   and   his   deceased\n\nrelatives were identified as “dukun santets” (a type of mystic or\n\nsorcerer) in their home area of Banyuwangi and marked for death.\n\nPetitioner claims that his grandfather was murdered in Banyuwangi\n\nin January 2000, and that his cousin was also murdered there\n\nshortly after Petitioner arrived in the United States.\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\f           In support of his application Petitioner submitted as\n\nexhibits three news articles describing a wave of violence against\n\ndukun santets in East Java and particularly Banyuwangi between\n\nFebruary and October of 1998, resulting in the reported deaths of\n\n143 people. According to Petitioner’s oral testimony, in or around\n\nNovember 1999, Petitioner and his family became aware that people\n\nin   the   area    surrounding     Banyuwangi      suspected    Petitioner’s\n\ngrandfather   of    being   a    dukun   santet.      Shortly   thereafter,\n\nPetitioner “managed to flee my grandfather out of town” by taking\n\nhim from Banyuwangi to the city of Jember, which is also located in\n\nEast Java.    For an unstated reason, Petitioner claimed that “the\n\neffort failed and they still wanted my grandfather.”             Petitioner\n\nclaims he returned his grandfather to Banyuwangi.                 Petitioner\n\nclaims that after returning to Banyuwangi, he witnessed a mob beat\n\nand kill his grandfather on January 14, 2000.\n\n           Petitioner claims that shortly thereafter he relocated to\n\nanother town for an undisclosed period of time, but eventually\n\nreturned to Banyuwangi. Upon his return, Petitioner states that he\n\nwas attacked and sustained injuries requiring hospitalization.\n\nPetitioner then fled to Jakarta in April 2000. Finally, Petitioner\n\nclaimed in oral testimony that his cousin was killed as a suspected\n\ndukun santet approximately one month after Petitioner left for the\n\nUnited States.\n\n           While a petitioner’s testimony alone may be enough to\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\festablish a right to withholding under certain circumstances, 8\n\nC.F.R. § 208.16(b), testimony that is vague and inconsistent does\n\nnot support a claim for asylum or withholding.                     See Diab v.\n\nAshcroft, 397 F.3d 35, 40 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n             The IJ exposed a number of vague or inconsistent points\n\nin Petitioner’s testimony.         First and foremost, Petitioner could\n\nprovide no clear reason why he decided to return his grandfather to\n\nBanyuwangi in 2000.      The IJ also noted other discrepancies between\n\nPetitioner’s application and his oral testimony that undermined his\n\ncredibility. For example, Petitioner’s application states that his\n\nfamily lives in Jakarta, but at his hearing, Petitioner insisted\n\nthat they live in Banyuwangi.2            Petitioner’s application claims\n\nthat his brother was murdered shortly after Petitioner escaped to\n\nthe United States, but in his oral testimony he denied having a\n\nbrother and claimed that his cousin was murdered instead. Although\n\nminor     inconsistencies    in    an   application     do   not    necessarily\n\nundermine a petitioner’s credibility, see Chebchoub v. INS, 257\n\nF.3d 1038, 1043 (9th Cir. 2001), the composition and location of\n\nthe     Petitioner’s     family    is    particularly     important      because\n\nPetitioner’s     claim    for     withholding    hinges      on    the    details\n\nsurrounding    the     alleged    mistreatment   of   his    family      members.\n\n\n\n      2\n      Petitioner’s application for asylum actually lists his parents\nas living in “Barhuwamgi,” Indonesia, his written statement claims\nthat “all my family go to the Jakarta City to looking for\npeacefully and safety.”\n\n                                        -6-\n\fPetitioner failed to provide a convincing explanation for these\n\ndiscrepancies, and we cannot conclude that the record compels a\n\ndecision different from that of the IJ.\n\n          The record also demonstrates that Petitioner’s claimed\n\nthreat of persecution is confined to only part of Indonesia.   If a\n\nnon-resident can relocate without a probability of persecution,\n\nwithholding should be denied. 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(b)(3). Petitioner\n\nadmits that he worked outside of Banyuwangi as a carpenter from\n\nJuly of 1999 to July of 2000 without incident.      Petitioner also\n\nadmits that he resided in Jakarta without incident from December\n\n2000 to January 2001. The IJ found sufficient evidence to conclude\n\nthat Petitioner would not be subject to persecution in Jakarta and\n\nother areas of Indonesia where he has stayed in the past.       The\n\nevidence on the record does not compel otherwise.   Accordingly, we\n\nhave no reason to overturn the determination of the IJ adopted by\n\nthe BIA and deny Petitioner’s request for withholding under 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1231(b)(3).\n\n                               IV.\n\n          In order to satisfy the requirements of the Convention,\n\nthe Petitioner bears the burden of showing that he will be tortured\n\nif returned to Indonesia.   See 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(c)(2).   As with\n\nwithholding and asylum, “[t]he testimony of the [petitioner], if\n\ncredible, may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without\n\ncorroboration.”   Id.\n\n\n                               -7-\n\f           A petitioner must show five elements to qualify for\n\nwithholding under the Convention.             Petitioner must show that, more\n\nlikely than not, he will be subjected to “(1) an act causing severe\n\nphysical or mental pain and suffering; (2) intentionally inflicted;\n\n(3) for a proscribed purpose; (4) by or at the instigation of or\n\nwith the consent or acquiescence of a public official who has\n\ncustody or physical control of the victim; and (5) not arising from\n\nlawful sanctions.” Settenda v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 89, 94 (1st Cir.\n\n2004), quoting Elien v. Ashcroft, 364 F.3d 392, 398 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).\n\n           In addition to the fact that Petitioner has failed to\n\nshow a likelihood that he will suffer severe physical or mental\n\npain and suffering, Petitioner’s claim under the Convention fails\n\nbecause he was not, nor is he likely to be, harmed through the\n\nactions or acquiescence of a public official.                 According to the\n\nPetitioner, local villagers threatened him and murdered his family\n\nmembers.      There is no evidence on the record compelling the\n\nconclusion that the state authorized or participated in these\n\nactivities.      In    fact,    the     IJ    specifically      found    that   the\n\nPetitioner’s    own    evidence        demonstrated    that     the     Indonesian\n\ngovernment had intervened to stop such attacks in 1998, over a year\n\nprior to the alleged death of Petitioner’s grandfather. Petitioner\n\ndid   testify   that   the     local    police    failed   to    issue    a   death\n\ncertificate for his grandfather’s murder; however, there is no\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fevidence that the Indonesian authorities were aware of any planned\n\nviolence against Petitioner’s grandfather prior to the attacks and\n\nfailed to perform their lawful duty to prevent such attacks.         We\n\ntherefore    uphold   the   BIA’s   adopted   determination   and   deny\n\nPetitioner withholding under the Convention.\n\n                                    V.\n\n            The record does not compel any conclusion different from\n\nthe BIA’s adopted findings in this case.        Petitioner’s claim of\n\npast persecution is both vague and inconsistent.      Petitioner’s own\n\ntestimony establishes that he does not face a threat of persecution\n\neverywhere in Indonesia. Moreover, any claim for withholding under\n\nthe Convention fails because Petitioner has not demonstrated that\n\nthe state would promote or acquiesce in the torture of Petitioner\n\nupon his return to Indonesia.\n\n            Thus, the petition for review is DENIED.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\f",

Petitioner\n\nconcedes that he did not file a claim for asylum within one year\n\nafter his arrival in the United States.        The IJ advised Petitioner\n\nthat his application for asylum would not be accepted without a\n\nspecial motion showing why he failed to apply within one year of\n\nhis arrival.       The IJ found that no such motion was filed, and\n\ntherefore    dismissed      Petitioner’s     application.         8   U.S.C.\n\n§ 1158(a)(3) provides that “[n]o court shall have jurisdiction to\n\nreview any determination of the Attorney General under paragraph\n\n[(a)](2),” which includes the IJ’s determination regarding the\n\ntimeliness of Petitioner’s asylum application and the existence of\n\nchanged or extraordinary circumstances justifying waiver of the\n\none-year time limitation.

The non-\n\ncitizen has the burden of persuasion to “show either that (i) he\n\nhas suffered past persecution on account of one of the five\n\nprotected grounds (thus creating a rebuttable presumption that he\n\nmay suffer future persecution), or (ii) it is more likely than not\n\nthat he will be persecuted on account of a protected ground upon\n\nhis return to his native land.”          Da Silva, 394 F.3d at 4; see 8\n\nC.F.R. § 208.16(b) (2005).\n\n           Petitioner claims he is the victim of past persecution in\n\nthe form of harassment of himself and the murder of two family\n\nmembers.    Specifically,    he   alleges    that   he   and   his   deceased\n\nrelatives were identified as “dukun santets” (a type of mystic or\n\nsorcerer) in their home area of Banyuwangi and marked for death.\n\nPetitioner claims that his grandfather was murdered in Banyuwangi\n\nin January 2000, and that his cousin was also murdered there\n\nshortly after Petitioner arrived in the United States.\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\f           In support of his application Petitioner submitted as\n\nexhibits three news articles describing a wave of violence against\n\ndukun santets in East Java and particularly Banyuwangi between\n\nFebruary and October of 1998, resulting in the reported deaths of\n\n143 people. According to Petitioner’s oral testimony, in or around\n\nNovember 1999, Petitioner and his family became aware that people\n\nin   the   area    surrounding     Banyuwangi      suspected    Petitioner’s\n\ngrandfather   of    being   a    dukun   santet.      Shortly   thereafter,\n\nPetitioner “managed to flee my grandfather out of town” by taking\n\nhim from Banyuwangi to the city of Jember, which is also located in\n\nEast Java.    For an unstated reason, Petitioner claimed that “the\n\neffort failed and they still wanted my grandfather.”             Petitioner\n\nclaims he returned his grandfather to Banyuwangi.                 Petitioner\n\nclaims that after returning to Banyuwangi, he witnessed a mob beat\n\nand kill his grandfather on January 14, 2000.\n\n           Petitioner claims that shortly thereafter he relocated to\n\nanother town for an undisclosed period of time, but eventually\n\nreturned to Banyuwangi. Upon his return, Petitioner states that he\n\nwas attacked and sustained injuries requiring hospitalization.\n\nPetitioner then fled to Jakarta in April 2000. Finally, Petitioner\n\nclaimed in oral testimony that his cousin was killed as a suspected\n\ndukun santet approximately one month after Petitioner left for the\n\nUnited States.\n\n           While a petitioner’s testimony alone may be enough to\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\festablish a right to withholding under certain circumstances, 8\n\nC.F.R. § 208.16(b), testimony that is vague and inconsistent does\n\nnot support a claim for asylum or withholding.                     See Diab v.\n\nAshcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201440\"><a href=\"/opinion/201440/diab-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 40 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n             The IJ exposed a number of vague or inconsistent points\n\nin Petitioner’s testimony.         First and foremost, Petitioner could\n\nprovide no clear reason why he decided to return his grandfather to\n\nBanyuwangi in 2000.      The IJ also noted other discrepancies between\n\nPetitioner’s application and his oral testimony that undermined his\n\ncredibility. For example, Petitioner’s application states that his\n\nfamily lives in Jakarta, but at his hearing, Petitioner insisted\n\nthat they live in Banyuwangi.2            Petitioner’s application claims\n\nthat his brother was murdered shortly after Petitioner escaped to\n\nthe United States, but in his oral testimony he denied having a\n\nbrother and claimed that his cousin was murdered instead. Although\n\nminor     inconsistencies    in    an   application     do   not    necessarily\n\nundermine a petitioner’s credibility, see Chebchoub v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774107\"><a href=\"/opinion/774107/abderrahman-chebchoub-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1038</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1043 (9th Cir. 2001), the composition and location of\n\nthe     Petitioner’s     family    is    particularly     important      because\n\nPetitioner’s     claim    for     withholding    hinges      on    the    details\n\nsurrounding    the     alleged    mistreatment   of   his    family      members.\n\n\n\n      2\n      Petitioner’s application for asylum actually lists his parents\nas living in “Barhuwamgi,” Indonesia, his written statement claims\nthat “all my family go to the Jakarta City to looking for\npeacefully and safety.”\n\n                                        -6-\n\fPetitioner failed to provide a convincing explanation for these\n\ndiscrepancies, and we cannot conclude that the record compels a\n\ndecision different from that of the IJ.\n\n          The record also demonstrates that Petitioner’s claimed\n\nthreat of persecution is confined to only part of Indonesia.   If a\n\nnon-resident can relocate without a probability of persecution,\n\nwithholding should be denied. 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(b)(3). Petitioner\n\nadmits that he worked outside of Banyuwangi as a carpenter from\n\nJuly of 1999 to July of 2000 without incident.      Petitioner also\n\nadmits that he resided in Jakarta without incident from December\n\n2000 to January 2001. The IJ found sufficient evidence to conclude\n\nthat Petitioner would not be subject to persecution in Jakarta and\n\nother areas of Indonesia where he has stayed in the past.       The\n\nevidence on the record does not compel otherwise.   Accordingly, we\n\nhave no reason to overturn the determination of the IJ adopted by\n\nthe BIA and deny Petitioner’s request for withholding under 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1231(b)(3).\n\n                               IV.\n\n          In order to satisfy the requirements of the Convention,\n\nthe Petitioner bears the burden of showing that he will be tortured\n\nif returned to Indonesia.   See 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(c)(2).   As with\n\nwithholding and asylum, “[t]he testimony of the [petitioner], if\n\ncredible, may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without\n\ncorroboration.”   Id.\n\n\n                               -7-\n\f           A petitioner must show five elements to qualify for\n\nwithholding under the Convention.             Petitioner must show that, more\n\nlikely than not, he will be subjected to “(1) an act causing severe\n\nphysical or mental pain and suffering; (2) intentionally inflicted;\n\n(3) for a proscribed purpose; (4) by or at the instigation of or\n\nwith the consent or acquiescence of a public official who has\n\ncustody or physical control of the victim; and (5) not arising from\n\nlawful sanctions.” Settenda v.

According to the\n\nPetitioner, local villagers threatened him and murdered his family\n\nmembers.      There is no evidence on the record compelling the\n\nconclusion that the state authorized or participated in these\n\nactivities.      In    fact,    the     IJ    specifically      found    that   the\n\nPetitioner’s    own    evidence        demonstrated    that     the     Indonesian\n\ngovernment had intervened to stop such attacks in 1998, over a year\n\nprior to the alleged death of Petitioner’s grandfather. Petitioner\n\ndid   testify   that   the     local    police    failed   to    issue    a   death\n\ncertificate for his grandfather’s murder; however, there is no\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fevidence that the Indonesian authorities were aware of any planned\n\nviolence against Petitioner’s grandfather prior to the attacks and\n\nfailed to perform their lawful duty to prevent such attacks.         We\n\ntherefore    uphold   the   BIA’s   adopted   determination   and   deny\n\nPetitioner withholding under the Convention.\n\n                                    V.\n\n            The record does not compel any conclusion different from\n\nthe BIA’s adopted findings in this case.        Petitioner’s claim of\n\npast persecution is both vague and inconsistent.      Petitioner’s own\n\ntestimony establishes that he does not face a threat of persecution\n\neverywhere in Indonesia. Moreover, any claim for withholding under\n\nthe Convention fails because Petitioner has not demonstrated that\n\nthe state would promote or acquiesce in the torture of Petitioner\n\nupon his return to Indonesia.\n\n            Thus, the petition for review is DENIED.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\f</pre>",
