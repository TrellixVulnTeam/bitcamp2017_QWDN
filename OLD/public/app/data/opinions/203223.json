O'Toole, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n               Torruella and Lynch, Circuit Judges,\n                    and Fusté,* District Judge.\n\n\n     Albert F. Cullen, Jr., for appellant.\n     Leah B. Foley, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, were on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                           April 3, 3008\n\n\n\n\n*\n    Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.\n\f            TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.          On May 3, 2006, Jermaine N.\n\nPolitano pled guilty to engaging in the business of dealing in\n\nfirearms without a license, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(a)\n\n(1)(A).     At sentencing, Politano requested, and the Government\n\nrecommended, a twelve-month term of incarceration.            The district\n\ncourt calculated Politano's Guidelines Sentencing Range (\"GSR\") to\n\nbe twelve to eighteen months, based on an offense level of 13, but\n\nproceeded     to    sentence        Politano    to   twenty-four   months'\n\nincarceration.     Politano now appeals his sentence.        After careful\n\nconsideration, we affirm the sentence.\n\n                               I.    Background\n\n            In April 2005, Politano sold three guns and approximately\n\n100 rounds of ammunition to a confidential witness.          On August 24,\n\n2005, Politano was indicted on one count of engaging in the\n\nbusiness of dealing in firearms without a license.                 Politano\n\nsubsequently pled guilty to the charges in the indictment.\n\n            At sentencing, the district court adopted the presentence\n\nreport's (\"PSR\") recommended Guidelines offense level of 13.            To\n\narrive at that offense level, the court began with a base offense\n\nlevel of 12 for \"prohibited transactions involving firearms or\n\nammunition,\" U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(a)(7), added two levels because the\n\noffense involved three to seven firearms, id. § 2K2.1(b)(1)(A), and\n\ntwo more levels because at least one firearm \"was stolen,\" id.\n\n§ 2K2.1(b)(4)(A).     It then reduced the offense level by three for\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\facceptance of responsibility to arrive at the offense level of 13.\n\nId.   §   3E1.1   (a)   &   (b).   The    court   also   accepted   the   PSR's\n\ndetermination that the defendant had a criminal history category I,\n\nand that his advisory GSR was therefore twelve to eighteen months.\n\n            The district court went on to invite the parties to\n\naddress the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) and\n\nsuggest an appropriate sentence. The Government stated that it was\n\nconcerned about \"what will happen when Mr. Politano is discharged\"\n\nand that it was important to continue to detain Politano until the\n\nProbation Department could devise a program to prevent recidivism.\n\nThe   Government        recommended   a     sentence     of   twelve   months'\n\nincarceration, followed by a three-year term of supervised release.\n\n            The district court asked the probation officer about\n\ncertain unresolved criminal matters in Brockton District Court.1\n\nThe probation officer stated that the cases were in fact unresolved\n\nand that default warrants had been issued because Politano, being\n\nin federal custody, was unable to appear in those cases.               Counsel\n\nfor Politano said he would \"move those cases along\" once he had the\n\nopportunity to do so.\n\n\n\n\n1\n   Politano has \"two open matters\" in Brockton District Court. He\nfaces charges for assault and battery, assault and battery with a\ndangerous weapon, and malicious damage to a motor vehicle. He also\nfaces charges in the same court for disturbing the peace and\ndisorderly conduct. As of the filing of this appeal, Politano had\nnot appeared in Brockton and \"technical warrants\" had been issued.\n\n                                      -3-\n\f          Politano    told   the   court   that   he   agreed   with   the\n\nGovernment's recommendation of twelve months' incarceration.            He\n\nnoted that he agreed it was \"necessary for a plan to be in place\"\n\nwith the Probation Department before Politano's release.         Politano\n\nalso emphasized that he had only one prior conviction for resisting\n\narrest.   Finally, he noted that under the supervision of the\n\nProbation Department, Politano could \"start working and lead a\n\nproductive life.\"\n\n          At that point, the district court began its consideration\n\nof the sentence, first addressing the \"nature and circumstances\" of\n\nthe offense.    The district court explained that, pursuant to 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3553, it would consider \"the seriousness of the offense,\n\nto promote respect for the law, to provide just punishment, to\n\nafford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct both specifically\n\nand generally, and to protect the public from further crimes by the\n\ndefendant.\"    The court further stated:\n\n          I think any reader of the daily newspapers is\n          aware that the illegal trafficking of firearms\n          at   the   street  level    is  a   significant\n          contributing    factor    in   what,    without\n          exaggeration I think, can be called an\n          epidemic of handgun violence in communities\n          within this district. Not only do guns sold\n          illegally in this way directly facilitate\n          crimes of violence, but they also indirectly\n          facilitate   other   crimes,   including   drug\n          offenses. And so I think in light of these\n          considerations, it is necessary to regard this\n          \"engaging in the business,\" I emphasize that,\n          of selling firearms illegally to be a very\n          serious offense in this district at this point\n          in time. And so I think it has to be punished\n\n                                   -4-\n\f           by a sentence which reflects the seriousness,\n           promotes respect for it in compliance with the\n           law, and has an effect both specifically but\n           also a general deterrence effect as advice to\n           others who might commit it.\n\n           Another   factor    is   the    history   and\n           characteristics of the defendant. And it is\n           true he is a young man. He has a very brief\n           countable criminal history.   There are more\n           encounters with the law enforcement than are\n           countable under the Guidelines. And I think\n           when considered in conjunction with the\n           defendant's social history, it is, I think,\n           fair to say that the Guidelines somewhat\n           underestimate or undercount the likelihood of\n           recidivism, which is a concern.\n\n           The district court then sentenced Politano to twenty-four\n\nmonths' incarceration.      The court had not advised the parties\n\nbeforehand that it was considering a sentence above the Guidelines\n\nrecommendation.\n\n           On   appeal,   Politano    challenges   the   sentence   on   two\n\ngrounds.   First, he argues that the sentence is unreasonable.\n\nSecond, he argues that the sentence is defective for lack of\n\nnotice.\n\n                            II.   Discussion\n\n           A.   Reasonableness\n\n           We review a district court's sentence for reasonableness,\n\nwhich involves a procedural as well as a substantive inquiry.            See\n\nGall v. United States, 128 S. Ct. 586, 597 (2007); United States v.\n\nMartin, No. 06-1983, 2008 WL 748104, at *4-5 (1st Cir. Mar. 21,\n\n2008).\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f             We first determine whether the district court made any\n\nprocedural errors \"such as failing to calculate (or improperly\n\ncalculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as\n\nmandatory, failing to consider the [18 U.S.C.] § 3553(a) factors,\n\nselecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing\n\nto   adequately    explain   the    chosen   sentence     –-   including    an\n\nexplanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\"                 Gall,\n\n128 S. Ct. at 597.    Where the district court has committed no such\n\nerror, we next turn to the substantive reasonableness of the\n\nsentence actually imposed and review the sentence for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.    See Martin, 2008 WL 748104, at *5; see also Gall, 128\n\nS. Ct. at 594 (\"Our explanation of 'reasonableness' review in the\n\nBooker opinion made it pellucidly clear that the familiar abuse-of-\n\ndiscretion standard of review now applies to appellate review of\n\nsentencing decisions.\" (citing United States v. Booker, 543 U.S.\n\n220, 260-62 (2005))); Rita v. United States, 127 S. Ct. 2456, 2465\n\n(2007) (\"[R]easonableness review merely asks whether the trial\n\ncourt abused its discretion.\").\n\n             In view of the Supreme Court's recent decision in Gall,\n\nwe emphasize that the broad discretion afforded to the district\n\ncourt   is   paramount:   after    the   court   has   calculated   the    GSR,\n\n\"sentencing becomes a judgment call, and a variant sentence may be\n\nconstructed based on a complex of factors whose interplay and\n\nprecise weight cannot even be precisely described.\"            Martin, 2008\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fWL 748104, at *4        (quoting United States v. Vega-Santiago, No. 06-\n\n1558, 2008 WL 451813, at *3 (1st Cir. Feb. 21, 2008)(en banc)).\n\n\"[T]he   linchpin       of    a     reasonableness        sentence      is    a   plausible\n\nsentencing rationale and a defensible overall result.\"                            Id. at *8\n\n(citing United States v. Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 519 (1st\n\nCir. 2006) (en banc)).\n\n           After properly calculating the GSR, the district court in\n\nthis case sentenced Politano to a term above the recommended range\n\nbased on the § 3553(a) factors.                 Our focus is, therefore, directed\n\nat whether the district court provided a sufficient explanation for\n\nits variance and whether the overall result is defensible. Id., at\n\n*4 (\"The Court's reasons for deviation should typically be rooted\n\neither in the nature and circumstances of the offense or the\n\ncharacteristics        of     the    offender;     must    add    up    to    a   plausible\n\nrationale;      and    must       justify   a    variance    of    the       magnitude   in\n\nquestion.\").\n\n           In imposing its sentence, the district court noted that\n\nthe crime of engaging in the business of dealing in firearms\n\nwithout a license is \"a very serious offense in [the District of\n\nMassachusetts] at this point in time,\" specifically because it\n\n\"directly facilitate[s] crimes of violence, . . . [and] indirectly\n\nfacilitate[s]         other    crimes,      including      drug    offenses\"        in   the\n\nDistrict   of    Massachusetts.             Consequently,         the   district      court\n\nopined, Politano's crime \"ha[d] to be punished by a sentence which\n\n\n                                            -7-\n\freflects [the] seriousness [of the offense], promotes respect for\n\nit in compliance with the law, and has an effect both specifically\n\nbut also a general deterrence effect as advice to others who might\n\ncommit   it.\"     Thus,   in   considering   the   factors   set    forth   in\n\n§ 3553(a),2 the district court thought that the community-specific\n\ncharacteristics in the District of Massachusetts made Politano's\n\noffense more serious and the need for deterrence greater than that\n\nreflected by the Guidelines.\n\n           Considerations regarding the \"seriousness of the offense\"\n\nand \"adequate deterrence\" are both factors which the district court\n\nis required to consider.        See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(A) & (B).\n\nPolitano's challenge is not that the district court took those\n\nfactors into account, but that the court's explanation was flawed\n\nbecause it relied on \"generalized reports\" rather than individual\n\nconduct.   The argument is misconceived.       Pre-Booker, this circuit\n\nhad held that consideration of local community characteristics\n\ndirectly contravened the Sentencing Commission's policy choice \"to\n\ndispense   with     inequalities    based    on    localized       sentencing\n\nresponses.\"     United States v. Aguilar-Pena, 887 F.2d 347, 352 (1st\n\nCir. 1989). We concluded that Congress could not have intended for\n\n\"a district court [to] override the guidelines merely because the\n\n\n2\n   Specifically, the district court considered the need for the\nsentence imposed \"to reflect the seriousness of the offense\" and\n\"to promote respect for the law,\" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(A), and\n\"to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,\" id. § 3553\n(a)(2)(B).\n\n                                    -8-\n\fcrime was perpetrated locally.\"            Id. at 351-52.        After Booker,\n\nthose Guidelines are no longer mandatory. Furthermore, the Supreme\n\nCourt's decision in Kimbrough \"opened the door for a sentencing\n\ncourt to deviate from the guidelines in an individual case even\n\nthough    that    deviation   seemingly     contravenes      a    broad   policy\n\npronouncement of the Sentencing Commission.\"                 Martin, 2008 WL\n\n748104, at *9 (citing Kimbrough, 128 S. Ct. at 574-75); see also\n\nRita, 127 S. Ct. at 2465 (allowing a district to find that \"the\n\nGuidelines sentence should not apply, perhaps because . . . the\n\ncase at hand falls outside the 'heartland' to which the commission\n\nintends    individual   Guidelines    to    apply,   perhaps       because   the\n\nGuidelines sentence itself fails properly to reflect § 3553(a)\n\nconsiderations, or perhaps because the case warrants a different\n\nsentence regardless.\" (emphasis added) (citation omitted)).\n\n            Post-Booker, it is now apparent that the district court\n\nhas the discretion to take into account all of the circumstances\n\nunder     which   Politano    committed     the   offense,       including   the\n\nparticular community in which the offense arose.                 In considering\n\nthe characteristics of that community, the district court has the\n\nauthority to conclude that the impact of this particular offense is\n\nmore serious than that reflected by the Sentencing Commission.\n\nIndeed, the § 3553(a) factors expressly provide for consideration\n\nof general deterrence: section 3553(a)(2)(B) states that \"[t]he\n\ncourt, in determining the particular sentence to be imposed, shall\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fconsider the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate\n\ndeterrence to criminal conduct.\"             General deterrence is about\n\npreventing criminal behavior by the population at large and,\n\ntherefore, incorporates some consideration of persons beyond the\n\ndefendant.    See U.S.S.G. ch. 4, pt. A, introductory cmt. (\"General\n\ndeterrence of criminal conduct dictates that a clear message be\n\nsent to society that repeated criminal behavior will aggravate the\n\nneed for punishment with each recurrence.\" (emphasis added)).               In\n\nthis case, the district court expressly considered the ways in\n\nwhich Politano's firearms offense was more serious and harmful\n\nwithin this specific community.         Cf. United States v. Cavera, 505\n\nF.3d 216, 223 (2d Cir. 2007) (vacating the sentence because \"[t]he\n\ndistrict court does not purport to establish that Cavera's crime\n\nwas itself more harmful, but only that his crime falls within a\n\ncategory of offenses (gun crimes in densely populated areas) that\n\nthe district court viewed as more serious, on average, than gun\n\ncrimes in less urban communities\").          Therefore, to the extent the\n\ndistrict     court's    explanation    is    grounded   in   \"case    specific\n\nconsiderations,\" we accord a \"respectful deference\" to its \"fact-\n\nintensive sentencing decisions.\" Martin, 2008 WL 748104, at *4, 8-\n\n9.\n\n           The district court also relied on Politano's \"unresolved\n\ncharges\" in Brockton District Court to enhance his sentence.\n\nSpecifically,     the    district   court     stated,   \"[t]here     are   more\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fencounters with law enforcement than are countable under the\n\nGuidelines.    And I think when considered in conjunction with the\n\ndefendant's social history, it is, I think, fair to say that the\n\nGuidelines somewhat underestimate or undercount the likelihood of\n\nrecidivism, which is a concern.\"     Specifically, the district court\n\nwas concerned about outstanding warrants for a charge of assault\n\nand battery with a dangerous weapon, and for charges of disturbing\n\nthe peace and disorderly conduct.\n\n          Sections 3553(a)(1) and 3553(a)(2)(c) invite the district\n\ncourt to consider, broadly, \"the nature and circumstances of the\n\noffense and the history and characteristics of the defendant\" and\n\n\"the need for the sentence imposed . . . to protect the public from\n\nfurther crimes of the defendant.\" In view of these considerations,\n\nthe district court acted within its discretion in finding that\n\nPolitano's likelihood of recidivism was underestimated in the\n\nGuidelines.3   See United States v. Pelletier, 469 F.3d 194, 203\n\n(1st Cir. 2006); cf. United States v. Solís-Bermúdez, 501 F.3d 882,\n\n886-87 (8th Cir. 2007) (discussing the district court's discretion\n\npost-Booker    to   decline   an   upward   departure   under   U.S.S.G.\n\n\n\n\n3\n   The district court's determination of the appropriate sentence\nin this case came after consideration of several § 3553(a) factors.\nThis is not a case in which the resulting variance was due solely\nto a prior arrest or outstanding charge.     In such a case, more\nexplanation may be required. See United States v. Zapete-García,\n447 F.3d 57, 60 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n                                   -11-\n\f§ 4A1.3(a), but apply an upward variance under § 3553(a)(1) and\n\n(a)(2)(c) on the basis of criminal history).\n\n           Moreover,      in   concluding     that    the    district     court's\n\nsentence is reasonable, we recognize that \"sentencing decisions\n\nrepresent instances in which the whole sometimes can be greater\n\nthan the sum of the constituent parts.\"           Martin, 2008 WL 748104, at\n\n*8.   In this case, after considering the PSR and the arguments of\n\ncounsel,   the    district     court   concluded     that,   in    view   of    the\n\n§ 3553(a) factors, the GSR fell below that which was appropriate\n\nfor Politano's offense and circumstances.             The district court was\n\nwell within its discretion in concluding that a six-month increase\n\nto the sentence was merited.\n\n           B.    Lack of Notice\n\n           Politano next argues that the sentence should be vacated\n\nbecause the district court failed to give advance notice that it\n\nintended to impose a sentence above the Guidelines range.                      In a\n\nrecent decision, we rejected the applicability of the Federal Rule\n\nof Criminal Procedure Rule 32(h) notice requirement to post-Booker\n\nvariances.      See Vega-Santiago, 2008 WL 451813.4            We held that a\n\njudge must provide advance notice or grant a continuance only in\n\nthose   cases    where   the   district   court      \"propos[ed]    to    adopt   a\n\n\n\n4\n   While I continue to disagree with the outcome of Vega-Santiago,\nI am compelled to follow this rule until the Supreme Court rules\notherwise.

Politano pled guilty to engaging in the business of dealing in firearms without a license, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(a)(1)(A). At sentencing, Politano requested, and the Government recommended, a twelve-month term of incarceration. The district court calculated Politano's Guidelines Sentencing Range (\"GSR\") to be twelve to eighteen months, based on an offense level of 13, but proceeded to sentence Politano to twenty-four months' incarceration. Politano now appeals his sentence. After careful consideration, we affirm the sentence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In April 2005, Politano sold three guns and approximately 100 rounds of ammunition to a confidential witness. On August 24, 2005, Politano was indicted on one count of engaging in the business of dealing in firearms without a license. Politano subsequently pled guilty to the charges in the indictment.</p>\n<p>At sentencing, the district court adopted the presentence report's (\"PSR\") recommended Guidelines offense level of 13. To arrive at that offense level, the court began with a base offense level of 12 for \"prohibited transactions involving firearms or ammunition,\" U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(a)(7), added two levels because the offense involved three to seven firearms, <i>id.</i> § 2K2.1(b)(l)(A), and two more levels because at least one firearm \"was stolen,\" <i>id.</i> § 2K2.1(b)(4)(A). It then reduced the offense level by three for acceptance of responsibility to arrive at the offense level of 13. <i>Id.</i> § 3El.l(a) &amp; (b). The court also accepted the PSR's determination that the defendant had a criminal history category I, and that his advisory GSR was therefore twelve to eighteen months.</p>\n<p>The district court went on to invite the parties to address the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) and suggest an appropriate sentence. The Government stated that it was concerned about \"what will happen when Mr. Politano is discharged\" and that it was important to continue to detain Politano until the Probation Department could devise a program to prevent recidivism. The Government recommended a sentence of twelve months' incarceration, followed by a three-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p>The district court asked the probation officer about certain unresolved criminal matters in Brockton District Court.<sup>[1]</sup> The probation officer stated that the cases were in fact unresolved and that default warrants had been issued because Politano, being in federal custody, was unable to appear in those cases. Counsel for Politano said he would \"move those cases along\" once he had the opportunity to do so.</p>\n<p>Politano told the court that he agreed with the Government's recommendation of twelve months' incarceration. He noted that he agreed it was \"necessary for a plan to be in place\" with the Probation Department before Politano's release. Politano also emphasized that he had only one prior conviction for resisting arrest. Finally, he noted that under the supervision of the Probation Department, Politano could \"start working and lead a productive life.\"</p>\n<p>At that point, the district court began its consideration of the sentence, first addressing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*72</span> the \"nature and circumstances\" of the offense. The district court explained that, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3553, it would consider \"the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, to provide just punishment, to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct both specifically and generally, and to protect the public from further crimes by the defendant.\" The court further stated:</p>\n<blockquote>I think any reader of the daily newspapers is aware that the illegal trafficking of firearms at the street level is a significant contributing factor in what, without exaggeration I think, can be called an epidemic of handgun violence in communities within this district. Not only do guns sold illegally in this way directly facilitate crimes of violence, but they also indirectly facilitate other crimes, including drug offenses. And so I think in light of these considerations, it is necessary to regard this \"engaging in the business,\" I emphasize that, of selling firearms illegally to be a very serious offense in this district at this point in time. And so I think it has to be punished by a sentence which reflects the seriousness, promotes respect for it in compliance with the law, and has an effect both specifically but also a general deterrence effect as advice to others who might commit it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Another factor is the history and characteristics of the defendant. And it is true he is a young man. He has a very brief countable criminal history. There are more encounters with the law enforcement than are countable under the Guidelines. And I think when considered in conjunction with the defendant's social history, it is, I think, fair to say that the Guidelines somewhat underestimate or undercount the likelihood of recidivism, which is a concern.</blockquote>\n<p>The district court then sentenced Politano to twenty-four months' incarceration. The court had not advised the parties beforehand that it was considering a sentence above the Guidelines recommendation.</p>\n<p>On appeal, Politano challenges the sentence on two grounds. First, he argues that the sentence is unreasonable. Second, he argues that the sentence is defective for lack of notice.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>A. Reasonableness</p>\n<p>We review a district court's sentence for reasonableness, which involves a procedural as well as a substantive inquiry. <i>See </i><i>Gall v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <i>United States v. Martin,</i> 520 F.3d 87, 91-93, 2008 WL 748104, at *4-5 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>We first determine whether the district court made any procedural errors \"such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the [18 U.S.C] § 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence  including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\" <i>Gall,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 597. Where the district court has committed no such error, we next turn to the substantive reasonableness of the sentence actually imposed and review the sentence for abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>Martin,</i> 520 F.3d at 92-93, 2008 WL 748104, at *5; <i>see also </i><i>Gall,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 594 (\"Our explanation of `reasonableness' review in the <i>Booker</i> opinion made it pellucidly clear that the familiar abuse-of-discretion standard of review now applies to appellate review of sentencing decisions.\" (citing <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 260-62, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*73</span> L.Ed.2d 621 (2005))); <i>Rita v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, ___, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (\"[R]easonableness review merely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\").</p>\n<p>In view of the Supreme Court's recent decision in <i>Gall,</i> we emphasize that the broad discretion afforded to the district court is paramount: after the court has calculated the GSR, \"sentencing becomes a judgment call, and a variant sentence may be constructed based on a complex of factors whose interplay and precise weight cannot even be precisely described.\" <i>Martin,</i> 520 F.3d at 92, 2008 WL 748104, at *4 (quoting <i>United States v. Vega-Santiago,</i> 519 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir.2008)(en banc)). \"[T]he linchpin of a reasonableness sentence is a plausible sentencing rationale and a defensible overall result.\" <i>Id.</i> at 96, 2008 WL 748104, *8 (citing <i>United States v. Jiménez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d 514, 519 (1st Cir.2006) (en banc)).</p>\n<p>After properly calculating the GSR, the district court in this case sentenced Politano to a term above the recommended range based on the § 3553(a) factors. Our focus is, therefore, directed at whether the district-court provided a sufficient explanation for its variance and whether the overall result is defensible. <i>Id.,</i> 91, 2008 WL 748104, at *4 (\"The Court's reasons for deviation should typically be rooted either in the nature and circumstances of the offense or the characteristics of the offender; must add up to a plausible rationale; and must justify a variance of the magnitude in question.\").</p>\n<p>In imposing its sentence, the district court noted that the crime of engaging in the business of dealing in firearms without a license is \"a very serious offense in [the District of Massachusetts] at this point in time,\" specifically because it \"directly facilitate[s] crimes of violence, . . . [and] indirectly facilitate[s] other crimes, including drug offenses\" in the District of Massachusetts. Consequently, the district court opined, Politano's crime \"ha[d] to be punished by a sentence which reflects [the] seriousness [of the offense], promotes respect for it in compliance with the law, and has an effect both specifically but also a general deterrence effect as advice to others who might commit it.\" Thus, in considering the factors set forth in § 3553(a),<sup>[2]</sup> the district court thought that the community-specific characteristics in the District of Massachusetts made Politano's offense more serious and the need for deterrence greater than that reflected by the Guidelines.</p>\n<p>Considerations regarding the \"seriousness of the offense\" and \"adequate deterrence\" are both factors which the district court is required to consider. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(A) &amp; (B). Politano's challenge is not that the district court took those factors into account, but that the court's explanation was flawed because it relied on \"generalized reports\" rather than individual conduct. The argument is misconceived. <i>Fre-Booker,</i> this circuit had held that consideration of local community characteristics directly contravened the Sentencing Commission's policy choice \"to dispense with inequalities based on localized sentencing responses.\" <i>United States v. Aguilar-Pena,</i> 887 F.2d 347, 352 (1st Cir.1989). We concluded that Congress could not have intended for \"a district court [to] override the guidelines merely because the crime was perpetrated locally.\" <i>Id.</i> at 351-52; After <i>Booker,</i> those <span class=\"star-pagination\">*74</span> Guidelines are no longer mandatory. Furthermore, the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Kimbrough</i> \"opened the door for a sentencing court to deviate from the guidelines in an individual case even though that deviation seemingly contravenes a broad policy pronouncement of the Sentencing Commission.\" <i>Martin,</i> 520 F.3d at 96, 2008 WL 748104, at *9 (citing <i>Kimbrough,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 574-75); <i>see also </i><i>Rita,</i> 127 S.Ct. at 2465 (allowing a district to find that \"the Guidelines sentence should not apply, perhaps because . . . the case at hand falls outside the `heartland' to which the commission intends individual Guidelines to apply, <i>perhaps because the Guidelines sentence itself fails properly to reflect § 3553(a) considerations,</i> or perhaps because the case warrants a different sentence regardless.\" (emphasis added) (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p>Post-Boofcer, it is now apparent that the district court has the discretion to take into account all of the circumstances underwhich Politano committed the offense, including the particular community in which the offense arose. In considering the characteristics of that community, the district court has the authority to conclude that the impact of this particular offense is more serious than that reflected by the Sentencing Commission. Indeed, the § 3553(a) factors expressly provide for consideration of general deterrence: section 3553(a)(2)(B) states that \"[t]he court, in determining the particular sentence to be imposed, shall consider the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct.\" General deterrence is about preventing criminal behavior by the population ailarge and, therefore, incorporates some consideration of persons beyond the defendant. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. ch. 4, pt. A, introductory cmt. (\"General deterrence of criminal conduct, dictates that a clear message be sent <i>to society</i> that repeated criminal behavior will aggravate the need for punishment with each recurrence.\" (emphasis added)). In this case, the district court expressly considered the ways in which Politano's firearms offense was more serious and harmful within this specific community. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Cavera,</i> 505 F.3d 216, 223 (2d Cir.2007) (vacating the sentence because \"[t]he district court does not purport to establish that Cavera's crime was itself more harmful, but only that his crime falls within a category of offenses (gun crimes in densely populated areas) that the district court viewed as more serious, on average, than gun crimes in less urban communities\"). Therefore, to the extent the district court's explanation is grounded in \"case specific considerations,\" we accord a \"respectful deference\" to its \"fact-intensive sentencing decisions.\" <i>Martin,</i> 520 F.3d at 96-97, 2008 WL 748104, at *4, 8-9.</p>\n<p>The district court also relied on Politano's \"unresolved charges\" in Brockton District Court to enhance his sentence. Specifically, the district court stated, \"[t]here are more encounters with law enforcement than are countable under the Guidelines. And I think when considered in conjunction with the defendant's social history, it is, I think, fair to say that the Guidelines somewhat underestimate or undercount the likelihood of recidivism, which is a concern.\" Specifically, the district court was concerned about outstanding warrants for a charge of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, and for charges of disturbing the peace and disorderly conduct.</p>\n<p>Sections 3553(a)(1) and 3553(a)(2)(c) invite the district court to consider, broadly, \"the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant\" and \"the need for the sentence imposed . . . to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.\" In <span class=\"star-pagination\">*75</span> view of these considerations, the district court acted within its discretion in finding that Politano's likelihood of recidivism was underestimated in the Guidelines.<sup>[3]</sup><i>See </i><i>United States v. Pelletier,</i> 469 F.3d 194, 203 (1st Cir.2006); <i>cf. </i><i>United States v. Solís-Bermúdez,</i> 501 F.3d 882, 886-87 (8th Cir.2007) (discussing the district court's discretion post-Booker to decline an upward departure under U.S.S.G. § 4A1.3(a), but apply an upward variance under § 3553(a)(1) and (a)(2)(c) on the basis' of criminal history).</p>\n<p>Moreover, in concluding that the district court's sentence' is reasonable, we recognize that \"sentencing decisions represent instances in which the whole sometimes can be greater than the sum of the constituent parts.\" <i>Martin,</i> 520 F.3d at 95, 2008 WL 748104, at *8. In this case, after considering the PSR and the arguments of counsel, the district court concluded that, in view of the § 3553(a) factors, the GSR fell below that which was appropriate for Politano's offense and circumstances. The district court was well within its discretion in concluding that a six-month increase to the sentence was merited.</p>\n<p>B. Lack of Notice</p>\n<p>Politano next argues that the sentence should be vacated because the district court failed to give advance notice that it intended to impose a sentence above the Guidelines range. In a recent decision, we rejected the applicability of the Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure Rule 32(h) notice requirement to post<i>Booker</i> variances. <i>See Vega-Santiago,</i> 519 F.3d l.<sup>[4]</sup> We held that a judge must provide advance notice or grant a continuance only in those cases where the district court \"propos[ed] to adopt a variance sentence relying on some ground or fact that would <i>unfairly surprise</i> competent and reasonably prepared counsel.\"<sup>[5]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 5-6. Our inquiry is, therefore, limited to whether the district court's articulated grounds for its variance would have unfairly surprised competent and reasonably prepared counsel.</p>\n<p>As described above, the district judge in this case relied on three grounds for varying from the GSR: the seriousness of the crime, the need for deterrence, and the adequacy of the Guidelines sentence in addressing Politano's risk of recidivism. All three fall within the \"[g]arden variety considerations of culpability, criminal history, likelihood of re-offense, seriousness of the crime, nature of the conduct and so forth [which] should not generally come as a surprise to trial lawyers who have prepared for sentencing.\" <i>Id.</i> at 3-4. We are unpersuaded that the facts of this case present an exceptional circumstance.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*76</span> The district court properly considered the seriousness of the crime, the need for deterrence, and Politano's likelihood of recidivism within its discussion of the § 3553(a) factors. Counsel are aware that post-<i>Booker,</i> the district court is required to consider and weigh each of the § 3553(a) factors. <i>See </i><i>Gall,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 596-97. The district court in this case simply considered and applied those factors to this case. Nothing in the district court's discussion of these factors indicates that they are beyond the scope of what reasonably prepared counsel should have been prepared to argue.<sup>[6]</sup> We are hardpressed to see how the district court's sentence on these grounds surprised counsel unfairly.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, the district court's sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed,</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Politano has \"two open matters\" in Brockton District Court. He faces charges for assault and battery, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, and malicious damage to a motor vehicle. He also faces charges in the same court for disturbing the peace and disorderly conduct. As of the filing of this appeal, Politano had not appeared in Brockton and \"technical warrants\" had been issued.</p>\n<p>[2]  Specifically, the district court considered the need for the sentence imposed \"to reflect the seriousness of the offense\" and \"to promote respect for the law,\" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(A), and \"to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,\" <i>id.</i> § 3553(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p>[3]  The district court's determination of the appropriate sentence in this case came after consideration of several § 3553(a) factors. This is not a case in which the resulting variance was due <i>solely</i> to a prior arrest or outstanding charge. In such a case, more explanation may be required. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Zapete-García,</i> 447 F.3d 57, 60 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>[4]  While I continue to disagree with the outcome of <i>Vega-Santiago,</i> I am compelled to follow this rule until the Supreme Court rules otherwise. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Irizarry,</i> 458 F.3d 1208 (11th Cir.2006), <i>cert, granted,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 828, 169 L.Ed.2d 625 (2008).</p>\n<p>[5]  In a letter filed pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 28(j), Politano asserts that the district court should have provided notice under Rule 32(h) because `the court's sentence contained an actual departure for which counsel was not notified in advance.\" We decline to consider this untimely argument. Politano concedes that this argument was not made on appeal, and we accordingly deem it to be waived. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Sleeper Farms v. Agway, Inc.,</i> 506 F.3d 98, 104 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>[6]  With respect to the consideration of Politano's criminal history, even under Rule 32(h), notice is only required for those grounds not identified in the PSR or one of the party's prehearing submissions. Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(h). Politano's criminal history was clearly outlined in the PSR and counsel admits to being \"well aware of Mr. Politano's record and the potential effects it could have on the sentence.\"</p>\n\n</div>",

And it is true he is a young man. He has a very brief countable criminal history. There are more encounters with the law enforcement than are countable under the Guidelines. And I think when considered in conjunction with the defendant's social history, it is, I think, fair to say that the Guidelines somewhat underestimate or undercount the likelihood of recidivism, which is a concern.</blockquote>\n<p>The district court then sentenced Politano to twenty-four months' incarceration. The court had not advised the parties beforehand that it was considering a sentence above the Guidelines recommendation.</p>\n<p>On appeal, Politano challenges the sentence on two grounds. First, he argues that the sentence is unreasonable. Second, he argues that the sentence is defective for lack of notice.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>A.

Our focus is, therefore, directed at whether the district-court provided a sufficient explanation for its variance and whether the overall result is defensible. <i>Id.,</i> 91, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">748104</span></span>, at *4 (\"The Court's reasons for deviation should typically be rooted either in the nature and circumstances of the offense or the characteristics of the offender; must add up to a plausible rationale; and must justify a variance of the magnitude in question.\").</p>\n<p>In imposing its sentence, the district court noted that the crime of engaging in the business of dealing in firearms without a license is \"a very serious offense in [the District of Massachusetts] at this point in time,\" specifically because it \"directly facilitate[s] crimes of violence, . . . [and] indirectly facilitate[s] other crimes, including drug offenses\" in the District of Massachusetts. Consequently, the district court opined, Politano's crime \"ha[d] to be punished by a sentence which reflects [the] seriousness [of the offense], promotes respect for it in compliance with the law, and has an effect both specifically but also a general deterrence effect as advice to others who might commit it.\" Thus, in considering the factors set forth in § 3553(a),<sup>[2]</sup> the district court thought that the community-specific characteristics in the District of Massachusetts made Politano's offense more serious and the need for deterrence greater than that reflected by the Guidelines.</p>\n<p>Considerations regarding the \"seriousness of the offense\" and \"adequate deterrence\" are both factors which the district court is required to consider. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(A) &amp; (B). Politano's challenge is not that the district court took those factors into account, but that the court's explanation was flawed because it relied on \"generalized reports\" rather than individual conduct. The argument is misconceived. <i>Fre-Booker,</i> this circuit had held that consideration of local community characteristics directly contravened the Sentencing Commission's policy choice \"to dispense with inequalities based on localized sentencing responses.\" <i>United States v. Aguilar-Pena,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"530534\"><a href=\"/opinion/530534/united-states-v-jorge-armando-aguilar-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">887</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">347</span></a></span>, 352 (1st Cir.1989). We concluded that Congress could not have intended for \"a district court [to] override the guidelines merely because the crime was perpetrated locally.\" <i>Id.</i> at 351-52; After <i>Booker,</i> those <span class=\"star-pagination\">*74</span> Guidelines are no longer mandatory. Furthermore, the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Kimbrough</i> \"opened the door for a sentencing court to deviate from the guidelines in an individual case even though that deviation seemingly contravenes a broad policy pronouncement of the Sentencing Commission.\" <i>Martin,</i> 520 F.3d at 96, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">748104</span></span>, at *9 (citing <i>Kimbrough,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 574-75); <i>see also </i><i>Rita,</i> 127 S.Ct. at 2465 (allowing a district to find that \"the Guidelines sentence should not apply, perhaps because . . . the case at hand falls outside the `heartland' to which the commission intends individual Guidelines to apply, <i>perhaps because the Guidelines sentence itself fails properly to reflect § 3553(a) considerations,</i> or perhaps because the case warrants a different sentence regardless.\" (emphasis added) (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p>Post-Boofcer, it is now apparent that the district court has the discretion to take into account all of the circumstances underwhich Politano committed the offense, including the particular community in which the offense arose. In considering the characteristics of that community, the district court has the authority to conclude that the impact of this particular offense is more serious than that reflected by the Sentencing Commission. Indeed, the § 3553(a) factors expressly provide for consideration of general deterrence: section 3553(a)(2)(B) states that \"[t]he court, in determining the particular sentence to be imposed, shall consider the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct.\" General deterrence is about preventing criminal behavior by the population ailarge and, therefore, incorporates some consideration of persons beyond the defendant. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. ch. 4, pt. A, introductory cmt. (\"General deterrence of criminal conduct, dictates that a clear message be sent <i>to society</i> that repeated criminal behavior will aggravate the need for punishment with each recurrence.\" (emphasis added)). In this case, the district court expressly considered the ways in which Politano's firearms offense was more serious and harmful within this specific community. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Cavera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2674\"><a href=\"/opinion/2674/united-states-v-cavera/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">216</span></a></span>, 223 (2d Cir.2007) (vacating the sentence because \"[t]he district court does not purport to establish that Cavera's crime was itself more harmful, but only that his crime falls within a category of offenses (gun crimes in densely populated areas) that the district court viewed as more serious, on average, than gun crimes in less urban communities\"). Therefore, to the extent the district court's explanation is grounded in \"case specific considerations,\" we accord a \"respectful deference\" to its \"fact-intensive sentencing decisions.\" <i>Martin,</i> 520 F.3d at 96-97, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">748104</span></span>, at *4, 8-9.</p>\n<p>The district court also relied on Politano's \"unresolved charges\" in Brockton District Court to enhance his sentence. Specifically, the district court stated, \"[t]here are more encounters with law enforcement than are countable under the Guidelines. And I think when considered in conjunction with the defendant's social history, it is, I think, fair to say that the Guidelines somewhat underestimate or undercount the likelihood of recidivism, which is a concern.\" Specifically, the district court was concerned about outstanding warrants for a charge of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, and for charges of disturbing the peace and disorderly conduct.</p>\n<p>Sections 3553(a)(1) and 3553(a)(2)(c) invite the district court to consider, broadly, \"the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant\" and \"the need for the sentence imposed . . . to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.\" In <span class=\"star-pagination\">*75</span> view of these considerations, the district court acted within its discretion in finding that Politano's likelihood of recidivism was underestimated in the Guidelines.<sup>[3]</sup><i>See </i><i>United States v. Pelletier,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796023\"><a href=\"/opinion/796023/united-states-v-joseph-pellether/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></a></span>, 203 (1st Cir.2006); <i>cf. </i><i>United States v. Solís-Bermúdez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1460407\"><a href=\"/opinion/1460407/united-states-v-solis-bermudez/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">882</span></a></span>, 886-87 (8th Cir.2007) (discussing the district court's discretion post-Booker to decline an upward departure under U.S.S.G. § 4A1.3(a), but apply an upward variance under § 3553(a)(1) and (a)(2)(c) on the basis' of criminal history).</p>\n<p>Moreover, in concluding that the district court's sentence' is reasonable, we recognize that \"sentencing decisions represent instances in which the whole sometimes can be greater than the sum of the constituent parts.\" <i>Martin,</i> 520 F.3d at 95, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">748104</span></span>, at *8. In this case, after considering the PSR and the arguments of counsel, the district court concluded that, in view of the § 3553(a) factors, the GSR fell below that which was appropriate for Politano's offense and circumstances. The district court was well within its discretion in concluding that a six-month increase to the sentence was merited.</p>\n<p>B. Lack of Notice</p>\n<p>Politano next argues that the sentence should be vacated because the district court failed to give advance notice that it intended to impose a sentence above the Guidelines range. In a recent decision, we rejected the applicability of the Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure Rule 32(h) notice requirement to post<i>Booker</i> variances. <i>See Vega-Santiago,</i> 519 F.3d l.<sup>[4]</sup> We held that a judge must provide advance notice or grant a continuance only in those cases where the district court \"propos[ed] to adopt a variance sentence relying on some ground or fact that would <i>unfairly surprise</i> competent and reasonably prepared counsel.\"<sup>[5]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 5-6. Our inquiry is, therefore, limited to whether the district court's articulated grounds for its variance would have unfairly surprised competent and reasonably prepared counsel.</p>\n<p>As described above, the district judge in this case relied on three grounds for varying from the GSR: the seriousness of the crime, the need for deterrence, and the adequacy of the Guidelines sentence in addressing Politano's risk of recidivism. All three fall within the \"[g]arden variety considerations of culpability, criminal history, likelihood of re-offense, seriousness of the crime, nature of the conduct and so forth [which] should not generally come as a surprise to trial lawyers who have prepared for sentencing.\" <i>Id.</i> at 3-4. We are unpersuaded that the facts of this case present an exceptional circumstance.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*76</span> The district court properly considered the seriousness of the crime, the need for deterrence, and Politano's likelihood of recidivism within its discussion of the § 3553(a) factors. Counsel are aware that post-<i>Booker,</i> the district court is required to consider and weigh each of the § 3553(a) factors. <i>See </i><i>Gall,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 596-97. The district court in this case simply considered and applied those factors to this case. Nothing in the district court's discussion of these factors indicates that they are beyond the scope of what reasonably prepared counsel should have been prepared to argue.<sup>[6]</sup> We are hardpressed to see how the district court's sentence on these grounds surprised counsel unfairly.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, the district court's sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed,</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Politano has \"two open matters\" in Brockton District Court. He faces charges for assault and battery, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, and malicious damage to a motor vehicle. He also faces charges in the same court for disturbing the peace and disorderly conduct. As of the filing of this appeal, Politano had not appeared in Brockton and \"technical warrants\" had been issued.</p>\n<p>[2]  Specifically, the district court considered the need for the sentence imposed \"to reflect the seriousness of the offense\" and \"to promote respect for the law,\" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(A), and \"to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,\" <i>id.</i> § 3553(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p>[3]  The district court's determination of the appropriate sentence in this case came after consideration of several § 3553(a) factors. This is not a case in which the resulting variance was due <i>solely</i> to a prior arrest or outstanding charge. In such a case, more explanation may be required. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Zapete-García,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202199\"><a href=\"/opinion/202199/united-states-v-zapete-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span>, 60 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>[4]  While I continue to disagree with the outcome of <i>Vega-Santiago,</i> I am compelled to follow this rule until the Supreme Court rules otherwise. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Irizarry,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"77452\"><a href=\"/opinion/77452/united-states-v-richard-irizzary/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1208</span></a></span> (11th Cir.2006), <i>cert, granted,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">625</span></span> (2008).</p>\n<p>[5]  In a letter filed pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 28(j), Politano asserts that the district court should have provided notice under Rule 32(h) because `the court's sentence contained an actual departure for which counsel was not notified in advance.\" We decline to consider this untimely argument. Politano concedes that this argument was not made on appeal, and we accordingly deem it to be waived. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Sleeper Farms v. Agway, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1292305\"><a href=\"/opinion/1292305/sleeper-farms-v-agway-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></a></span>, 104 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>[6]  With respect to the consideration of Politano's criminal history, even under Rule 32(h), notice is only required for those grounds not identified in the PSR or one of the party's prehearing submissions. Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(h). Politano's criminal history was clearly outlined in the PSR and counsel admits to being \"well aware of Mr. Politano's record and the potential effects it could have on the sentence.\"</p>\n\n</div>",
