Steven J. McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                    Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n\n      Souter, Associate Justice,* and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Stephen Paul Maidman for appellant.\n     Donald Feith, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom John\nP. Kacavas, United States Attorney, was on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                          April 15, 2010\n\n\n\n\n*\n    The Hon. David H. Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the\nSupreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.\n\f            SOUTER, Associate Justice.            While being held at a county\n\njail charged with attempting to set fire to the building where his\n\nex-girlfriend    lived,      defendant       Richard    Ellison        indicated    his\n\nwillingness to give the police information about a pair of unsolved\n\nrobberies elsewhere.         At an interview with a detective involved in\n\nthe latter cases, Ellison said the girlfriend was the robber and\n\nadmitted his own supporting role.            After being charged with aiding\n\nand abetting the crimes, he moved to suppress his statement.                        The\n\ndistrict court denied the motion, and we affirm.\n\n                                         I\n\n            On   January      24,   2006,     a   woman    attempted        to   rob    a\n\nconvenience store in Concord, New Hampshire, and when that effort\n\nwent awry she held up the clerk at a nearby grocery store and made\n\noff with $300.     The following December Ellison was in jail in the\n\nState’s north country, charged with trying to torch the dwelling of\n\nRobin   Theriault,     his    ex-girlfriend       and     the    beneficiary       of   a\n\nprotective order he had recently been convicted of violating.\n\nEllison let it be known to a Berlin Police Department detective,\n\nwho   was   speaking    with    him   in     connection         with   an   unrelated\n\ninvestigation, that he could provide information about the Concord\n\nrobberies.\n\n            The next day a Concord Police detective, Todd Flanagan,\n\njoined the Berlin officer in a second interview of Ellison, which\n\ntook place in the jail library.                Ellison was brought there in\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\frestraints, but these were removed at the request of Flanagan, who\n\nstated his understanding that Ellison wished to speak about the\n\nrobberies.   Flanagan told Ellison that he was not under arrest for\n\nthese crimes, did not have to answer any questions, and was free to\n\nend the interview at any time by pushing a button on the table to\n\nsummon the guards.   Neither officer, however, advised Ellison of\n\nother rights subject to warnings required by Miranda v. Arizona,\n\n384 U.S. 436 (1966).    Ellison was calm, showed no surprise, and\n\nconsented to a recorded interview, during which he disclosed his\n\nerstwhile romantic involvement with Theriault at the time of the\n\nrobberies, identified her as the robber and implicated himself in\n\na supporting role.\n\n          Ellison was then indicted for his part in the crimes,\n\nand, after the district court denied a motion to suppress his\n\nstatement, he conditionally pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting\n\nrobbery, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1951 and 2, and aiding and abetting the\n\npossession of a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence, 18\n\nU.S.C. §§ 924(c) and 2.   Here, Ellison contends that suppression\n\nwas required because there were no Miranda warnings, the statement\n\nwas coerced by a broken promise of leniency, and he had invoked his\n\nFifth and Sixth Amendment rights to counsel during the interview\n\nwith Flanagan.\n\n\n\n\n                                -3-\n\f                                     II\n\n            Miranda held that statements are generally inadmissible\n\nagainst a defendant if obtained during “custodial interrogation”\n\nwithout prior warnings that the suspect “has a right to remain\n\nsilent, that any statement he does make may be used as evidence\n\nagainst him, and that he has a right to the presence of an\n\nattorney, either retained or appointed.” Miranda, 384 U.S. at 444.\n\nThe central issue here is whether the interview in the library was\n\ncustodial    interrogation,     as    Ellison       says,    simply    because\n\nincarceration makes any interrogation custodial per se within the\n\nmeaning of Miranda.\n\n            Determinations about Miranda custody begin by examining\n\nall of the “circumstances surrounding the interrogation” and asking\n\nwhether “a reasonable person [would] have felt he or she was not at\n\nliberty to terminate the interrogation and leave,”                 Thompson v.\n\nKeohane, 516 U.S. 99, 112 (1995).            This “initial determination\n\n. . . depends on the objective circumstances of the interrogation,\n\nnot on the subjective views harbored by either the interrogating\n\nofficers or the person being questioned.” Stansbury v. California,\n\n511 U.S. 318, 323 (1994) (per curiam).          Once a court finds that a\n\nreasonable person in the suspect’s position would not have felt\n\nfree to end the interview and walk away, there is a further\n\nquestion    whether   the     suspect      would     reasonably     find     the\n\ncircumstances   coercive,     thus   raising       the   concern   that    drove\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fMiranda.   See Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U.S. 420, 436-37 (1984)\n\n(acknowledging that “a traffic stop significantly curtails . . .\n\n‘freedom of action,’” and then deciding “whether a traffic stop\n\nexerts upon a detained person pressures that sufficiently impair\n\nhis free exercise of his privilege against self-incrimination to\n\nrequire that he be warned of his constitutional rights”).   In the\n\nparadigm example of interrogating a suspect at a police station,\n\nthe answer is obvious, in the absence of unusual facts: that was\n\nthe situation in Miranda and the warnings are the required antidote\n\nto the stationhouse pressures observed there.     Miranda is to be\n\n“enforced strictly . . . in those types of situations in which the\n\nconcerns that powered the decision are implicated.”   Id. at 437.\n\n           But in dealing with a case outside the Miranda paradigm,\n\nit is essential to recall that “the freedom-of-movement test\n\nidentifies only a necessary and not a sufficient condition for\n\nMiranda custody.”      Maryland v. Shatzer, 130 S.Ct. 1213, 1224\n\n(2010). That is, custody under Miranda means a suspect is not free\n\nto go away, but a suspect’s lack of freedom to go away does not\n\nnecessarily mean that questioning is custodial interrogation for\n\npurposes of Miranda.\n\n           Never is this distinction more important than when the\n\nsubject of interrogation is independently incarcerated.   Even when\n\nhe is given the option to end the interrogation as he chooses, he\n\nis not in the position of a suspect who is free to walk away and\n\n\n                                -5-\n\froam around where he pleases, see, e.g., Oregon v. Mathiason, 429\n\nU.S. 492, 495 (1977).   Still, the restrictions on his freedom do\n\nnot necessarily equate his condition during any interrogation with\n\nMiranda custody.   While the suspect in a case just like Miranda\n\nmay well feel that the only way to end the pressure on him is to\n\nanswer the questions, the usual circumstances of someone serving\n\nprison time following a conviction characteristically save him from\n\nany such apprehension; so long as he is not threatened with harsher\n\nconfinement than normal until he talks, he knows that the worst\n\nthat can happen to him will be his return to prison routine, and\n\nthat he will be back on the street (in most cases) whether he\n\nanswers questions or refuses.   See Shatzer, 130 S.Ct. at 1224-25.\n\nAccordingly, the Supreme Court concluded in Shatzer that “lawful\n\nimprisonment imposed on conviction of a crime does not create the\n\ncoercive pressures identified in Miranda,” id. at 1224.1\n\n          Shatzer left open the question whether those pressures\n\nare necessarily brought to bear on someone who is incarcerated\n\n\n1\n   In Mathis v. United States, 391 U.S. 1 (1968), a suspect’s\nanswers incriminating him in tax fraud, given to federal\ninvestigators while he was imprisoned on a state conviction, were\nheld inadmissible because no Miranda warnings had been given. The\nCourt acknowledged Miranda’s applicability to questioning “‘when an\nindividual is taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his\nfreedom by the authorities in any significant way,’” id. at 5\n(quoting 384 U.S. at 478), but did not say whether the interview\nwith Mathis fell within Miranda because of his incarceration or\nbecause of some other deprivation that was significant in the\ncircumstances. Although it did not address Mathis, the Court’s\nopinion in Shatzer forecloses Ellison’s reading of the case for the\nformer proposition.\n\n                                -6-\n\fbefore trial and then interviewed about a crime distinct from the\n\npending charges.      It is true that the condition of someone being\n\nheld while awaiting trial, like Ellison, is not exactly the same as\n\nthe convict’s position, since the suspect might reasonably perceive\n\nthat the authorities have a degree of discretion over pretrial\n\nconditions, at least to the point of making recommendations to a\n\ncourt.   But we see nothing in the facts of this case that would be\n\nlikely to create the atmosphere of coercion subject to Miranda\n\nconcern. As mentioned, Detective Flanagan told Ellison that he was\n\nnot under arrest for the robberies and that he did not have to\n\nanswer any questions.        He was interviewed in the prison library\n\n(presumably   one     of   its    more    comfortable     areas),    he    was   not\n\nrestrained, and he could go from the library at any time after\n\npressing the button to summon the guards.2\n\n           The   relatively        low    atmospheric      pressure       in   these\n\ncircumstances    is   all   the    more    obvious   in    light    of    Ellison’s\n\npreviously expressed desire to tell the Concord police about the\n\nunsolved crimes; Ellison had suggested such an interview, and\n\nFlanagan was there to take him up on his proposal.                       And viewed\n\n\n\n2\n   On these facts, there would, of course, be no conclusion of\ncustodial interrogation in those circuits that have previously\napplied the rule that such interrogation of a prisoner occurs only\nwhen the suspect’s restraint is more rigorous than the\ninstitutional norm. See, e.g., Garcia v. Singletary, 13 F.3d 1487,\n1491 (11th Cir. 1994); United States v. Conley, 779 F.2d 970, 973\n(4th Cir. 1985); Cervantes v. Walker, 589 F.2d 424, 428 (9th Cir.\n1978).\n\n                                         -7-\n\fobjectively, the record readily shows why someone in Ellison’s\n\nposition would wish to be there talking.    Theriault, whom he had\n\nassaulted in violation of a protective order, and whose house he\n\nwas charged with attempting to set alight, was his ex-girlfriend.\n\nThe relationship had obviously gone sharply sour.      At the very\n\nleast, Ellison would not have hesitated to hurt her (again) and try\n\nto help himself by telling his story to the police.    There is no\n\nreason to find the concern of coercion behind Miranda implicated\n\nhere.\n\n          Ellison’s remaining arguments have no foundation.     He\n\nclaims that the officers “coerced” him into speaking by means of a\n\nsubsequently broken promise that he would not be prosecuted for his\n\nrole in the robberies.    The short answer to this is that the\n\ndistrict court found that no such promise was made.      The court\n\ncredited Flanagan’s testimony that Ellison was told only that his\n\ncooperation would be brought to the attention of the prosecutor,\n\nwho would determine what benefit, if any, Ellison would receive.\n\nEllison also argues that the interrogation should have ceased once\n\nhe invoked his right to counsel.   But the district court found as\n\na fact that Ellison’s testimony that he had demanded to speak with\n\ncounsel “at least five times” was not credible (though the judge\n\ndid conclude that “there probably was some discussion of counsel”\n\nthat the officer “brush[ed] aside”).     But even if Ellison had\n\nclearly expressed a desire to speak with a lawyer, he could not\n\n\n                               -8-\n\fhave invoked any constitutional right to do that in a non-custodial\n\ninterrogation conducted before he was formally charged. See United\n\nStates v. Wyatt, 179 F.3d 532, 537 (7th Cir. 1999) (“The Fifth\n\nAmendment right to counsel safeguarded by Miranda cannot be invoked\n\nwhen a suspect is not in custody . . . .”); United States v.\n\nBoskic, 545 F.3d 69, 84 (1st Cir. 2008) (“The Sixth Amendment takes\n\nhold when the investigation gives way to a prosecution . . . .”).\n\nSuppression could not, therefore, vindicate the Constitution.   In\n\nany event, the district court’s finding pretermits any issue based\n\non the requests alleged.\n\n                               III\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -9-\n\f",

At an interview with a detective involved in the latter cases, Ellison said the girlfriend was the robber and admitted his own supporting role. After being charged with aiding and abetting the crimes, he moved to suppress his statement. The district court denied the motion, and we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>On January 24, 2006, a woman attempted to rob a convenience store in Concord, New Hampshire, and when that effort went awry she held up the clerk at a nearby grocery store and made off with $300. The following December Ellison was in jail in the State's north country, charged with trying to torch the dwelling of Robin Theriault, his ex-girlfriend and the beneficiary of a protective order he had recently been convicted of violating. Ellison let it be known to a Berlin Police Department detective, who was speaking with him in connection with an unrelated investigation, that he could provide information about the Concord robberies.</p>\n<p>The next day a Concord Police detective, Todd Flanagan, joined the Berlin officer in a second interview of Ellison, which took place in the jail library. Ellison was brought there in restraints, but these were removed at the request of Flanagan, who stated his understanding that Ellison wished to speak about the robberies. Flanagan told Ellison that he was not under arrest for these crimes, did not have to answer any questions, and was free to end the interview at any time by pushing a button on the table to summon the guards. Neither officer, however, advised Ellison of other rights subject to warnings required by <i>Miranda v. Arizona,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">694</span></a></span> (1966). Ellison was calm, showed no surprise, and consented to a recorded interview, during which he disclosed his erstwhile romantic involvement with Theriault at the time of the robberies, identified her as the robber and implicated himself in a supporting role.</p>\n<p>Ellison was then indicted for his part in the crimes, and, after the district court denied a motion to suppress his statement, he conditionally pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting robbery, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1951 and 2, and aiding and abetting the possession of a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence, 18 U.S.C. §§ 924(c) and 2. Here, Ellison contends that suppression was required because there were no <i>Miranda</i> warnings, the statement was coerced by a broken promise of leniency, and he had invoked his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to counsel during the interview with Flanagan.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p><i>Miranda</i> held that statements are generally inadmissible against a defendant if obtained during \"custodial interrogation\" without prior warnings that the suspect \"has a right to remain silent, that any statement he does make may be used as evidence against him, and that he has a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*729</span> right to the presence of an attorney, either retained or appointed.\" <i>Miranda,</i> 384 U.S. at 444, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1602</span></a></span>. The central issue here is whether the interview in the library was custodial interrogation, as Ellison says, simply because incarceration makes any interrogation custodial <i>per se</i> within the meaning of <i>Miranda.</i></p>\n<p>Determinations about <i>Miranda</i> custody begin by examining all of the \"circumstances surrounding the interrogation\" and asking whether \"a reasonable person [would] have felt he or she was not at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave,\" <i>Thompson v. Keohane,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117982\"><a href=\"/opinion/117982/thompson-v-keohane/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">99</span></a></span>, 112, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117982\"><a href=\"/opinion/117982/thompson-v-keohane/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">383</span></a></span> (1995). This \"initial determination ... depends on the objective circumstances of the interrogation, not on the subjective views harbored by either the interrogating officers or the person being questioned.\" <i>Stansbury v. California,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117843\"><a href=\"/opinion/117843/stansbury-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">318</span></a></span>, 323, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117843\"><a href=\"/opinion/117843/stansbury-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">293</span></a></span> (1994) (per curiam). Once a court finds that a reasonable person in the suspect's position would not have felt free to end the interview and walk away, there is a further question whether the suspect would reasonably find the circumstances coercive, thus raising the concern that drove <i>Miranda. See </i><i>Berkemer v. McCarty,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111249\"><a href=\"/opinion/111249/berkemer-v-mccarty/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">420</span></a></span>, 436-37, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111249\"><a href=\"/opinion/111249/berkemer-v-mccarty/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">317</span></a></span> (1984) (acknowledging that \"a traffic stop significantly curtails ... `freedom of action,'\" and then deciding \"whether a traffic stop exerts upon a detained person pressures that sufficiently impair his free exercise of his privilege against self-incrimination to require that he be warned of his constitutional rights\"). In the paradigm example of interrogating a suspect at a police station, the answer is obvious, in the absence of unusual facts: that was the situation in <i>Miranda</i> and the warnings are the required antidote to the stationhouse pressures observed there. <i>Miranda</i> is to be \"enforced strictly ... in those types of situations in which the concerns that powered the decision are implicated.\" <i>Id.</i> at 437, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111249\"><a href=\"/opinion/111249/berkemer-v-mccarty/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3138</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>But in dealing with a case outside the <i>Miranda</i> paradigm, it is essential to recall that \"the freedom-of-movement test identifies only a necessary and not a sufficient condition for <i>Miranda</i> custody.\" <i>Maryland v. Shatzer,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1734\"><a href=\"/opinion/1734/maryland-v-shatzer/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1213</span></a></span>, 1224, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1734\"><a href=\"/opinion/1734/maryland-v-shatzer/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1045</span></a></span> (2010). That is, custody under <i>Miranda</i> means a suspect is not free to go away, but a suspect's lack of freedom to go away does not necessarily mean that questioning is custodial interrogation for purposes of <i>Miranda.</i></p>\n<p>Never is this distinction more important than when the subject of interrogation is independently incarcerated. Even when he is given the option to end the interrogation as he chooses, he is not in the position of a suspect who is free to walk away and roam around where he pleases, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Oregon v. Mathiason,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109587\"><a href=\"/opinion/109587/oregon-v-mathiason/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></a></span>, 495, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109587\"><a href=\"/opinion/109587/oregon-v-mathiason/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">711</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109587\"><a href=\"/opinion/109587/oregon-v-mathiason/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">714</span></a></span> (1977). Still, the restrictions on his freedom do not necessarily equate his condition during any interrogation with <i>Miranda</i> custody. While the suspect in a case just like <i>Miranda</i> may well feel that the only way to end the pressure on him is to answer the questions, the usual circumstances of someone serving prison time following a conviction characteristically save him from any such apprehension; so long as he is not threatened with harsher confinement than normal until he talks, he knows that the worst that can happen to him will be his return to prison routine, and that he will be back on the street (in most cases) whether he answers questions or refuses. <i>See </i><i>Shatzer,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 1224-25. Accordingly, the Supreme Court concluded in <i>Shatzer</i> that \"lawful imprisonment imposed on conviction of a crime does not create the coercive <span class=\"star-pagination\">*730</span> pressures identified in <i>Miranda,\" id.</i> at 1224.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p><i>Shatzer</i> left open the question whether those pressures are necessarily brought to bear on someone who is incarcerated before trial and then interviewed about a crime distinct from the pending charges. It is true that the condition of someone being held while awaiting trial, like Ellison, is not exactly the same as the convict's position, since the suspect might reasonably perceive that the authorities have a degree of discretion over pretrial conditions, at least to the point of making recommendations to a court. But we see nothing in the facts of this case that would be likely to create the atmosphere of coercion subject to <i>Miranda</i> concern. As mentioned, Detective Flanagan told Ellison that he was not under arrest for the robberies and that he did not have to answer any questions. He was interviewed in the prison library (presumably one of its more comfortable areas), he was not restrained, and he could go from the library at any time after pressing the button to summon the guards.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>The relatively low atmospheric pressure in these circumstances is all the more obvious in light of Ellison's previously expressed desire to tell the Concord police about the unsolved crimes; Ellison had suggested such an interview, and Flanagan was there to take him up on his proposal. And viewed objectively, the record readily shows why someone in Ellison's position would wish to be there talking. Theriault, whom he had assaulted in violation of a protective order, and whose house he was charged with attempting to set alight, was his ex-girlfriend. The relationship had obviously gone sharply sour. At the very least, Ellison would not have hesitated to hurt her (again) and try to help himself by telling his story to the police. There is no reason to find the concern of coercion behind <i>Miranda</i> implicated here.</p>\n<p>Ellison's remaining arguments have no foundation. He claims that the officers \"coerced\" him into speaking by means of a subsequently broken promise that he would not be prosecuted for his role in the robberies. The short answer to this is that the district court found that no such promise was made. The court credited Flanagan's testimony that Ellison was told only that his cooperation would be brought to the attention of the prosecutor, who would determine what benefit, if any, Ellison would receive. Ellison also argues that the interrogation should have ceased once he invoked his right to counsel. But the district court found as a fact that Ellison's testimony that he had demanded to speak with counsel \"at least five times\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*731</span> was not credible (though the judge did conclude that \"there probably was some discussion of counsel\" that the officer \"brush[ed] aside\"). But even if Ellison had clearly expressed a desire to speak with a lawyer, he could not have invoked any constitutional right to do that in a non-custodial interrogation conducted before he was formally charged. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Wyatt,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764707\"><a href=\"/opinion/764707/united-states-v-richard-c-wyatt/\"><span class=\"volume\">179</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">532</span></a></span>, 537 (7th Cir.1999) (\"The Fifth Amendment right to counsel safeguarded by <i>Miranda</i> cannot be invoked when a suspect is not in custody....\"); <i>United States v.

Suppression could not, therefore, vindicate the Constitution.
