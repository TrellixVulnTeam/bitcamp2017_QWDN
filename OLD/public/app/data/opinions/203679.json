Gustavo A. Gelpí, U.S. District Judge]\n\n         [Hon. Sara E. De Jesús, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                    Lipez, Selya, and Howard,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Noemi Landrau Rivera and Landrau Rivera & Associates on brief\nfor appellant.\n     Iván Acosta-Rivera and Aña A. Balseiro-Chacón on brief pro se.\n\n\n                        February 19, 2009\n\f           SELYA, Circuit Judge.       This appeal, which requires us to\n\ndecide an issue of first impression at the federal appellate level,\n\nturns on the construction of a provision of the Bankruptcy Abuse\n\nPrevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA or the Act),\n\nPub. L. 109-8, 119 Stat. 23 (2005).         Writ large, the provision in\n\nquestion expands the debtor's duties of financial disclosure to the\n\nextent that he or she must now file with the bankruptcy court,\n\n\"unless the court orders otherwise,\" six traunches of financial\n\ninformation (including payment advices and an itemized statement of\n\nmonthly net income).     11 U.S.C. § 521(a)(1)(B)(iv),(v).           The issue\n\ncenters on whether the bankruptcy court may enter an order excusing\n\nnon-disclosure after the time for filing the required information\n\nhas   expired.     The   bankruptcy    court   thought   that   it    had   the\n\nauthority to enter such an order. It proceeded to exercise that\n\npower, thus avoiding dismissal of the debtors' petition under\n\nsection    521(i)(1)     (BAPCPA's     so-called   \"automatic    dismissal\"\n\nprovision).      The district court construed the \"orders otherwise\"\n\nprovision differently.     Consequently, it determined that the order\n\nexcusing the failure to file was beyond the scope of the bankruptcy\n\ncourt's authority.       See Rivera v. Miranda, 376 B.R. 382, 386\n\n(D.P.R. 2007).\n\n           We conclude that the bankruptcy court acted in consonance\n\nwith the statutory scheme and within the realm of its discretion.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fAccordingly, we reverse the district court's order and remand for\n\nfurther proceedings.\n\n           The procedural background is uncomplicated. The debtors,\n\nIván Acosta-Rivera and Aña Balseiro-Chacón, are married to each\n\nother. They originally filed a joint Chapter 13 petition and later\n\nconverted that filing to a Chapter 7 petition.1           The debtors'\n\nestate   included   an   unresolved   employment   discrimination   suit\n\nbrought by Acosta-Rivera against his quondam employer.         In that\n\nsuit, which had been pending for roughly eight years and had twice\n\nbeen appealed to the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, Acosta-Rivera\n\nsought reinstatement, backpay, and compensatory damages.\n\n           At this point, the plot thickens. Although this chose in\n\naction was plainly an asset of the debtors' estate, it did not\n\nappear on their original bankruptcy schedules, their first amended\n\nschedules, or their second amended schedules.\n\n           Six months after the filing of the bankruptcy petition,\n\nthe debtors revealed the existence of the chose in action, listing\n\nits value as \"unknown,\" in their third amended set of schedules.\n\nEven then, they failed to disclose that the suit demanded pecuniary\n\n\n\n     1\n       In brief, a Chapter 13 bankruptcy allows individuals who\nhave a regular source of income to submit to the bankruptcy court\na plan to repay all or part of their debts over a three to five\nyear period. During the repayment period creditors are stayed from\nstarting or continuing collection efforts. See 11 U.S.C. §§ 1321-\n1330. Chapter 7 is a liquidation. See 11 U.S.C. §§ 701-784. A\nbankruptcy trustee collects and sells the debtor's non-exempt\nassets and uses those proceeds to pay creditors.\n\n                                  -3-\n\frelief (e.g., backpay and money damages).               After several further\n\namendments (not material here), the debtors valued the chose in\n\naction at $2,700,000 and claimed an exemption of $350,000.\n\n               Eventually, the Chapter 7 trustee moved for leave to\n\nsettle the suit for $200,000 (a sum that would have generated\n\nenough cash to pay all allowed claims and produce some surplus\n\nfunds for the debtors).          Balking at this proposal, the debtors\n\nmoved       under   the   automatic    dismissal     provision,   11     U.S.C.   §\n\n521(i)(2), to confirm the dismissal of their petition.                 In support\n\nof their motion, they claimed not to have filed or otherwise\n\nprovided the payment advices and statement of monthly net income\n\nrequired by BAPCPA.         As their attorney acknowledged, the debtors\n\nwanted to dismiss the bankruptcy case so that they could \"continue\n\nprosecuting the state court action\" for damages.\n\n               We pause at this juncture to discuss the Act's \"automatic\n\ndismissal\"      provision.      When    a   debtor   fails   to   file    all   the\n\ninformation required by section 521(a)(1)(B) within the prescribed\n\nperiod — that is, within forty-five days of the filing date of the\n\nbankruptcy petition — BAPCPA provides that \"the case shall be\n\nautomatically dismissed.\"2             11 U.S.C. § 521(i)(1).            The term\n\n\n        2\n       The automatic dismissal deadline can be extended by another\nforty-five days upon timely request. See 11 U.S.C. § 521(i)(3).\nMoreover, the automatic dismissal provision is subject to an\nexplicit statutory exception: a timely motion by the trustee to\nforestall dismissal based on the best interests of the creditors\nand the debtors' good-faith efforts to effect the required filing.\nId. § 521(i)(1), (4). That exception does not apply here.\n\n                                        -4-\n\f\"automatic dismissal\" is something of a misnomer.             Typically,\n\ndismissal under this provision takes place at the instance of a\n\n\"party in interest.\"    Id. § 521(i)(2); see, e.g., In re Spencer,\n\n388 B.R. 418, 421 (Bankr. D.D.C. 2008).        Dismissal is, therefore,\n\nhardly \"automatic.\"3\n\n           We return to what transpired below.       In due season, the\n\nbankruptcy court denied the debtors' motion to dismiss, finding\n\nthat \"facts peculiar to this case do not require dismissal under\n\nsection 521.\" In support, the court noted that the debtors' motion\n\nstemmed from their \"disagreement with the proposed settlement.\"\n\nThat was significant because the putative settlement would have\n\nsatisfied all allowed claims; thus, neither the creditors nor the\n\ntrustee needed the missing (undisclosed) information.           Based on\n\nthat reasoning, the court entered \"an order nunc pro tunc . . .\n\nexcusing the debtors from filing the payment advices mentioned in\n\nsection   521(a)(1)(B)(iv).\"4   In    short,   the   court   excused   the\n\ndetailed disclosure by ordering the debtors to do \"otherwise\" under\n\nsection 521(a)(1)(B).\n\n\n\n\n     3\n       A few courts have conceptualized dismissal under this\nsection as a matter involving only the counting of the days. See,\ne.g., In re Fawson, 338 B.R. 505, 510 (Bankr. D. Utah 2006). To\ndecide this case, we need not resolve that question.\n     4\n        Although not explicitly mentioned, the court evidently\nmeant to excuse as well the filing of the monthly net income\nstatement. We proceed on that assumption.\n\n                                -5-\n\f             In a subsequent order, the court approved the trustee's\n\nrevised   recommendation     to   settle    the   discrimination   case   for\n\n$600,000, citing the likelihood of delay from further litigation,\n\nuncertainties surrounding collection, and the fact that Acosta-\n\nRivera stood to receive nearly $400,000, less mortgage arrearages,\n\nafter the allowed claims were paid.\n\n             The debtors appealed the denial of their motion to\n\ndismiss to the district court.       The district judge ruled that the\n\nbankruptcy court lacked authority to excuse compliance with the\n\ndisclosure requirement more than forty-five days after the debtors\n\nfiled their bankruptcy petition.       See Rivera, 376 B.R. at 386.        In\n\nthe judge's view, the strictures of the Act left the bankruptcy\n\njudge \"with no discretion to fashion any reasonable or equitable\n\nsolution.\"      Id.   at   386-87.    The    judge   stated:   \"'After    the\n\nexpiration of the specified period set forth in 11 U.S.C. §\n\n521(i)(1), there are no exceptions, no excuses, only dismissal and\n\nthe consequences that flow therefrom.'\"           Id. at 386 (quoting In re\n\nOtt, 343 B.R. 264, 268 (Bankr. D. Colo. 2006)).         This timely appeal\n\nfollowed.5\n\n             Some preliminary pruning is in order.           The Chapter 7\n\ntrustee devotes much of his brief to General Order 05-06 of the\n\n\n     5\n       Only the United States Trustee filed an answering brief in\nthe district court.    That court, however, designated both the\nUnited States Trustee and the Chapter 7 trustee as appellees. The\nChapter 7 trustee has taken the instant appeal. We are satisfied\nthat he has standing to do so.\n\n                                     -6-\n\fbankruptcy court, which directs debtors not to file the payment\n\nadvices required by section 521(a)(1)(B)(iv), but, rather, to\n\nprovide them to the trustee and interested creditors.   The general\n\norder further provides that \"[f]ailure of debtor to comply with the\n\nrequirements of 11 U.S.C. § 521(a)(1)(B)(iv)\" — presumably as\n\nadjusted by the general order — \"will result in automatic dismissal\n\nunder section 521(i)(1).\"     This general order is standard fare:\n\nbankruptcy courts in numerous districts have adopted comparable\n\norders.   See In re Brickey, 363 B.R. 59, 64 & n.4 (Bankr. N.D.N.Y.\n\n2007).\n\n           Neither the bankruptcy court nor the district court\n\nmentioned General Order 05-06.    Moreover, even if the debtors had\n\ncomplied with this general order — a circumstance that the record\n\ndoes not document and that the debtors deny — the statutory issue\n\nwould persist.   By its terms, the general order is limited to the\n\npayment advices required by section 521(a)(1)(B)(iv); it does not\n\nmitigate the debtors' duty to file the statement of monthly net\n\nincome required by section 521(a)(1)(B)(v).\n\n           The trustee has yet another new argument.   For the first\n\ntime, he suggests that the debtors filed the functional equivalent\n\nof a monthly net income statement in the form of Schedule J.   This\n\nis too little and too late.\n\n           Schedule J deals with a debtor's current expenditures.\n\nIn the process, it responds to a different filing requirement,\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fcontained in 11 U.S.C. § 521(a)(1)(B)(ii).               Although line 20 of\n\nSchedule J is called a \"Statement of Monthly Net Income\" and the\n\nadvisory committee note to the official bankruptcy forms states\n\nthat this line was added to Schedule J in 2005 \"as required by §\n\n521(a)(1)(B)(v),\" there is no reason to think that Schedule J is a\n\nproxy for the statement of current monthly income required by\n\nsection 521(a)(1)(B)(v).          In fact, the case law suggests the\n\nopposite conclusion.        See, e.g., In re Turner, 384 B.R. 852, 856\n\n(Bankr. D. Colo. 2008) (holding that a Chapter 7 debtor's duty to\n\nfile a section 521(a)(1)(B)(v) statement of monthly net income \"can\n\nonly be fulfilled by filing\" Form B22A).\n\n            We    need   not   probe    this   point   too   deeply.      Whether\n\nSchedule J can ever serve double duty in a given case is not before\n\nus.   Suffice it to say that, in this instance, we will not\n\nentertain the trustee's forfeited argument.              See Teamsters Union\n\nLocal No. 59 v. Superline Transp. Co., 953 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir.\n\n1992) (\"If any principle is settled in this circuit, it is that,\n\nabsent the most extraordinary circumstances, legal theories not\n\nsquarely raised in the lower court cannot be broached for the first\n\ntime on appeal.\").\n\n            Having cleared away the underbrush, what remains is the\n\nquestion    of    the    bankruptcy     court's   authority    to    waive   the\n\ndisclosure       requirement    after    the   expiration     of    the   filing\n\ndeadline.    The statute provides that the debtor \"shall . . . file\"\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fthe required disclosures \"unless the court orders otherwise.\"      11\n\nU.S.C. § 521(a)(1)(B).    The grant of judicial power to \"order[]\n\notherwise\" predated BAPCPA.6   In overhauling section 521, Congress\n\nleft this familiar language intact.        We do not regard that as a\n\nmere fortuity.    Nor do we think that a slip of the pen accounts\n\nfor the fact that the provision does not now contain an explicit\n\ndeadline for ordering otherwise.       In this context, we have a high\n\nregard for congressional silence.\n\n            Sharing this regard, a few courts have held that the\n\nbankruptcy court possesses authority to waive the disclosure\n\nrequirement even after the forty-five-day filing deadline has\n\nexpired.    See, e.g., In re Parker, 351 B.R. 790, 801-02 (Bankr.\n\nN.D. Ga. 2006); In re Jackson, 348 B.R. 487, 499-500 (Bankr. S.D.\n\nIowa 2006); cf. In re Bonner, 374 B.R. 62, 64-65 (Bankr. W.D.N.Y.\n\n2007) (suggesting that \"special circumstances can justify nunc pro\n\ntunc relief\" under section 521(i)).       Other courts, however, have\n\ntaken the view that BAPCPA's new forty-five-day deadline applies\n\nto courts and debtors alike.    See, e.g., In re Spencer, 388 B.R.\n\nat 422; Warren v. Wirum, 378 B.R. 640, 647 (N.D. Cal. 2007); In re\n\nHall, 368 B.R. 595, 599 (Bankr. W.D. Tex. 2007); In re Brickey,\n\n\n     6\n         The pre-BAPCPA version of section 521(1) provided:\n\n     The Debtor shall . . . file a list of creditors, and\n     unless the court orders otherwise, a schedule of assets\n     and liabilities, a schedule of current income and current\n     expenditures, and a statement of the debtor's financial\n     affairs.\n\n                                 -9-\n\f363 B.R. at 64-65 (Bankr. N.D.N.Y. 2007); In re Calhoun, 359 B.R.\n\n738, 740 (Bankr. E.D. Mo. 2007).          That view reads into the filing\n\ndeadline a restriction on bankruptcy courts' authority gleaned by\n\nimplication from the \"automatic dismissal\" provision.\n\n           Neither reading satisfies both head and heart in equal\n\nmeasure.   The former (more flexible) reading honors the policy\n\nbehind   the     Act   by   vesting   bankruptcy      courts   with    greater\n\ndiscretion to discourage bankruptcy abuse.             Because any party in\n\ninterest may request an order of automatic dismissal, debtors with\n\nsomething to hide are liable to treat dismissal as an escape hatch\n\nto be opened as needed.         See Parker, 351 B.R. at 802; see also\n\nHall, 368 B.R. at 602 (dismissing case on motion of debtor whom\n\ncourt describes as \"the poster child for a bad faith debtor\").                In\n\nsuch cases, the court has no occasion to address non-disclosure\n\nuntil long after the forty-five-day period has elapsed.                     That\n\ntimetable rubs uneasily against the strictures of an inflexible\n\nreading — and bankruptcy courts are, after all, courts of equity.\n\n           But the story has another side.           The stricter reading of\n\nthe   statute,    though    inflexible,      gives   sharper   teeth   to    the\n\nautomatic dismissal provision.          It ensures that dismissal at a\n\nparty's request is all but guaranteed once the forty-five days\n\nhave passed. Given Congress's concern with \"the recent escalation\n\nof consumer bankruptcy filings,\" H.R. Rep. No. 109-31, at 3-4,\n\nreprinted in 2005 U.S.C.C.A.N. 90, it can be argued that the\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fstricter reading has some implicit support in the legislative\n\nhistory.    See, e.g., Warren, 378 B.R. at 647; see also Rivera, 376\n\nB.R. at 386 (voicing concern that retroactive relief from the\n\nfiling requirement \"would render the automatic dismissal provision\n\nin § 521(i) meaningless\").\n\n            This position has a certain superficial appeal.   Still,\n\nwe must caution against trying to stretch a morsel into a meal.\n\nThe amendments to section 521 are part of an abuse-prevention\n\npackage.     With Congress's core purpose in mind, we are reluctant\n\nto read into the statute by implication a new limit on judicial\n\ndiscretion that would encourage rather than discourage bankruptcy\n\nabuse.     It is safe to say that Congress, in enacting BAPCPA, was\n\nnot bent on placing additional weapons in the hands of abusive\n\ndebtors.7\n\n            In all events, we believe that it is possible to give\n\neffect to all of section 521, preserving the bankruptcy court's\n\ndiscretion to forgive compliance with disclosure requirements\n\nafter the fact while at the same time preserving the authentic\n\nvalue of automatic dismissal.     When a party moves under section\n\n521(i)(2) for the entry of an order dismissing an incomplete\n\npetition, the court can do one of three things: dismiss the case,\n\n\n     7\n       By definition, such debtors are unfit for the \"good faith\"\nexception in section 521(i)(4). See supra note 2. Moreover, under\n11 U.S.C. § 707(a), a chapter 7 debtor has no absolute right to\ndismiss his petition but must instead show cause. See In re Smith,\n507 F.3d 64, 72 (2d Cir. 2007).\n\n                                 -11-\n\fdecline to dismiss the case if the good-faith exception for\n\npayment advices applies, see supra note 2; or determine, in its\n\ndiscretion, that the missing information is not \"required under\n\nsubsection (a)(1).\"    11 U.S.C. §521(i)(1).    In the last-mentioned\n\nevent, the court can deny the motion to dismiss.       Some courts in\n\n\"strict\" jurisdictions seem to assume that the second and third of\n\nthese options cover the same ground.     That thinking underlies the\n\nopinions construing the forty-five-day deadline for automatic\n\ndismissal as an implicit temporal limitation upon the court's\n\nauthority to order otherwise.      See, e.g., Spencer, 388 B.R. at\n\n422; Warren, 378 B.R. at 646; Hall, 368 B.R. at 599; Brickey, 363\n\nB.R. at 64-65; Calhoun, 359 B.R. at 740.\n\n            We find that mechanical reading unwise.   While it may be\n\ntextually plausible, it fails to harmonize the letter and purpose\n\nof the statute.    There is another, equally plausible reading — a\n\nreading that avoids this vice.\n\n            The approach that we endorse recognizes that missing\n\ninformation may or may not be required, in a practical sense,\n\ndepending upon what is deemed material by the court many months\n\n(or even years) after the bankruptcy petition has been filed.\n\nThis would seem to be a likely reason for Congress to have\n\nentrusted    the   bankruptcy   court   with   discretion   to   modify\n\ndisclosure requirements on the fly.     Where, as here, a previously\n\nhidden asset has more than enough value to cover the entire\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\funiverse of creditors' claims, dollar for dollar, dispensing with\n\nthe disclosure of statements reflecting payment advices and/or\n\nmonthly net income is both pragmatic and reasonable.

As we have said, BAPCPA did not\n\nexpressly curtail this aspect of the bankruptcy court's authority\n\nand, given the practical realities, we are reluctant to step in\n\nwhere Congress has elected not to tread.       Automatic dismissal may\n\nbe a new twist, but the importance of the judiciary's ability to\n\nassess   needs   and   respond   to   exigencies   free   of    artificial\n\nconstraints has not changed.          In our view, Congress must have\n\nrecognized that bankruptcy courts would still need a meaningful\n\nopportunity to gauge whether missing information is \"required\" in\n\na particular case.     We conclude, therefore, that when the missing\n\ninformation has become irrelevant or extraneous and the court, in\n\nlieu of dismissal on that account, \"order[s] otherwise,\" section\n\n521(i) does not compel dismissal of the case.8\n\n\n     8\n       To be sure, the time line for the entry of an order of\nautomatic dismissal suggests an impatience with delay.

Those exceptions apply when the court does not\n\nchoose to waive the disclosure requirement either ex ante or ex\n\npost; they do not apply when the court does so elect.           So\n\nunderstood, the exceptions operate within their own statutory\n\nambit and do not cabin the bankruptcy court's discretion in other\n\nareas.\n\n          Let us be perfectly clear.      We do not decide today\n\nwhether bankruptcy courts possess unfettered discretion to waive\n\nthe disclosure requirements ex post.   Where, however, there is no\n\ncontinuing need for the information or a waiver is needed to\n\nprevent automatic dismissal from furthering a debtor's abusive\n\nconduct, the court has discretion to take such an action. This\n\ncase is of that genre.9\n\n          To sum up, the great divide in section 521 is between\n\ninformation that is required and information that is not.   The Act\n\n\n\n\nwithin section 521(i)(1), \"the court shall enter an order of\ndismissal not later than 5 days after such request.\" 11 U.S.C. §\n521(i)(2).

In this case the bankruptcy\n\ncourt,   acting   with   care   and    restraint,   was   faithful   to   the\n\nevolving statutory scheme.       Its order was, therefore, within the\n\ncompass of its discretion.\n\n           The judgment of the district court is reversed and the\n\nmatter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this\n\nopinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\f",

Writ large, the provision in question expands the debtor's duties of financial disclosure to the extent that he or she must now file with the bankruptcy court, \"unless the court orders otherwise,\" six traunches of financial information (including payment advices and an itemized statement of monthly net income). 11 U.S.C. § 521(a)(1)(B)(iv),(v). The issue centers on whether the bankruptcy court may enter an order excusing non-disclosure <i>after</i> the time for filing the required information has expired. The bankruptcy court thought that it had the authority to enter such an order. It proceeded to exercise that power, thus avoiding dismissal of the debtors' petition under section 521(i)(1) (BAPCPA's so-called \"automatic dismissal\" provision). The district court construed the \"orders otherwise\" provision differently. Consequently, it determined that the order excusing the failure to file was beyond the scope of the bankruptcy court's authority. <i>See </i><i>Rivera v. Miranda,</i> 376 B.R. 382, 386 (D.P.R.2007).</p>\n<p>We conclude that the bankruptcy court acted in consonance with the statutory scheme and within the realm of its discretion. Accordingly, we reverse the district court's order and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p>The procedural background is uncomplicated. The debtors, Iván Acosta-Rivera <span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> and Aña Balseiro-Chacón, are married to each other. They originally filed a joint Chapter 13 petition and later converted that filing to a Chapter 7 petition.<sup>[1]</sup> The debtors' estate included an unresolved employment discrimination suit brought by Acosta-Rivera against his quondam employer. In that suit, which had been pending for roughly eight years and had twice been appealed to the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, Acosta-Rivera sought reinstatement, backpay, and compensatory damages.</p>\n<p>At this point, the plot thickens. Although this chose in action was plainly an asset of the debtors' estate, it did not appear on their original bankruptcy schedules, their first amended schedules, or their second amended schedules.</p>\n<p>Six months after the filing of the bankruptcy petition, the debtors revealed the existence of the chose in action, listing its value as \"unknown,\" in their third amended set of schedules. Even then, they failed to disclose that the suit demanded pecuniary relief (e.g., backpay and money damages). After several further amendments (not material here), the debtors valued the chose in action at $2,700,000 and claimed an exemption of $350,000.</p>\n<p>Eventually, the Chapter 7 trustee moved for leave to settle the suit for $200,000 (a sum that would have generated enough cash to pay all allowed claims and produce some surplus funds for the debtors). Balking at this proposal, the debtors moved under the automatic dismissal provision, 11 U.S.C. § 521(i)(2), to confirm the dismissal of their petition. In support of their motion, they claimed not to have filed or otherwise provided the payment advices and statement of monthly net income required by BAPCPA. As their attorney acknowledged, the debtors wanted to dismiss the bankruptcy case so that they could \"continue prosecuting the state court action\" for damages.</p>\n<p>We pause at this juncture to discuss the Act's \"automatic dismissal\" provision. When a debtor fails to file all the information required by section 521(a)(1)(B) within the prescribed period  that is, within forty-five days of the filing date of the bankruptcy petition  BAPCPA provides that \"the case shall be automatically dismissed.\"<sup>[2]</sup> 11 U.S.C. § 521(i)(1). The term \"automatic dismissal\" is something of a misnomer. Typically, dismissal under this provision takes place at the instance of a \"party in interest.\" <i>Id.</i> § 521(i)(2); <i>see, e.g., </i><i>In re Spencer,</i> 388 B.R. 418, 421 (Bankr.D.D.C.2008). Dismissal is, therefore, hardly \"automatic.\"<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>We return to what transpired below. In due season, the bankruptcy court denied the debtors' motion to dismiss, finding that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> \"facts peculiar to this case do not require dismissal under section 521.\" In support, the court noted that the debtors' motion stemmed from their \"disagreement with the proposed settlement.\" That was significant because the putative settlement would have satisfied all allowed claims; thus, neither the creditors nor the trustee needed the missing (undisclosed) information. Based on that reasoning, the court entered \"an order nunc pro tunc ... excusing the debtors from filing the payment advices mentioned in section 521(a)(1)(B)(iv).\"<sup>[4]</sup> In short, the court excused the detailed disclosure by ordering the debtors to do \"otherwise\" under section 521(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p>In a subsequent order, the court approved the trustee's revised recommendation to settle the discrimination case for $600,000, citing the likelihood of delay from further litigation, uncertainties surrounding collection, and the fact that Acosta-Rivera stood to receive nearly $400,000, less mortgage arrearages, after the allowed claims were paid.</p>\n<p>The debtors appealed the denial of their motion to dismiss to the district court. The district judge ruled that the bankruptcy court lacked authority to excuse compliance with the disclosure requirement more than forty-five days after the debtors filed their bankruptcy petition. <i>See </i><i>Rivera,</i> 376 B.R. at 386. In the judge's view, the strictures of the Act left the bankruptcy judge \"with no discretion to fashion any reasonable or equitable solution.\" <i>Id.</i> at 386-87. The judge stated: \"`After the expiration of the specified period set forth in 11 U.S.C. § 521(i)(1), there are no exceptions, no excuses, only dismissal and the consequences that flow therefrom.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 386 (quoting <i>In re Ott,</i> 343 B.R. 264, 268 (Bankr.D.Colo.2006)). This timely appeal followed.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Some preliminary pruning is in order. The Chapter 7 trustee devotes much of his brief to General Order 05-06 of the bankruptcy court, which directs debtors not to file the payment advices required by section 521(a)(1)(B)(iv), but, rather, to provide them to the trustee and interested creditors. The general order further provides that \"[f]ailure of debtor to comply with the requirements of 11 U.S.C. § 521(a)(1)(B)(iv)\"  presumably as adjusted by the general order  \"will result in automatic dismissal under section 521(i)(1).\" This general order is standard fare: bankruptcy courts in numerous districts have adopted comparable orders. <i>See </i><i>In re Brickey,</i> 363 B.R. 59, 64 &amp; n. 4 (Bankr. N.D.N.Y. 2007).</p>\n<p>Neither the bankruptcy court nor the district court mentioned General Order 05-06. Moreover, even if the debtors had complied with this general order  a circumstance that the record does not document and that the debtors deny  the statutory issue would persist. By its terms, the general order is limited to the payment advices required by section 521(a)(1)(B)(iv); it does not mitigate the debtors' duty to file the statement of monthly net income required by section 521(a)(1)(B)(v).</p>\n<p>The trustee has yet another new argument. For the first time, he suggests that the debtors filed the functional equivalent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> of a monthly net income statement in the form of Schedule J. This is too little and too late.</p>\n<p>Schedule J deals with a debtor's current expenditures. In the process, it responds to a different filing requirement, contained in 11 U.S.C. § 521(a)(1)(B)(ii). Although line 20 of Schedule J is called a \"Statement of Monthly Net Income\" and the advisory committee note to the official bankruptcy forms states that this line was added to Schedule J in 2005 \"as required by § 521(a)(1)(B)(v),\" there is no reason to think that Schedule J is a proxy for the statement of current monthly income required by section 521(a)(1)(B)(v). In fact, the case law suggests the opposite conclusion. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>In re Turner,</i> 384 B.R. 852, 856 (Bankr. D.Colo.2008) (holding that a Chapter 7 debtor's duty to file a section 521(a)(1)(B)(v) statement of monthly net income \"can only be fulfilled by filing\" Form B22A).</p>\n<p>We need not probe this point too deeply. Whether Schedule J can ever serve double duty in a given case is not before us. Suffice it to say that, in this instance, we will not entertain the trustee's forfeited argument. <i>See </i><i>Teamsters Union Local No. 59 v. Superline Transp. Co.,</i> 953 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir.1992) (\"If any principle is settled in this circuit, it is that, absent the most extraordinary circumstances, legal theories not squarely raised in the lower court cannot be broached for the first time on appeal.\").</p>\n<p>Having cleared away the underbrush, what remains is the question of the bankruptcy court's authority to waive the disclosure requirement after the expiration of the filing deadline. The statute provides that the debtor \"shall ... file\" the required disclosures \"unless the court orders otherwise.\" 11 U.S.C. § 521(a)(1)(B). The grant of judicial power to \"order[] otherwise\" predated BAPCPA.<sup>[6]</sup> In overhauling section 521, Congress left this familiar language intact. We do not regard that as a mere fortuity. Nor do we think that a slip of the pen accounts for the fact that the provision does not now contain an explicit deadline for ordering otherwise. In this context, we have a high regard for congressional silence.</p>\n<p>Sharing this regard, a few courts have held that the bankruptcy court possesses authority to waive the disclosure requirement even after the forty-five-day filing deadline has expired. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>In re Parker,</i> 351 B.R. 790, 801-02 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 2006); <i>In re Jackson,</i> 348 B.R. 487, 499-500 (Bankr. S.D. Iowa 2006); <i>cf. </i><i>In re Bonner,</i> 374 B.R. 62, 64-65 (Bankr.W.D.N.Y. 2007) (suggesting that \"special circumstances can justify <i>nunc pro tunc</i> relief\" under section 521(i)). Other courts, however, have taken the view that BAPCPA's new forty-five-day deadline applies to courts and debtors alike. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>In re Spencer,</i> 388 B.R. at 422; <i>Warren v. Wirum,</i> 378 B.R. 640, 647 (N.D.Cal.2007); <i>In re Hall,</i> 368 B.R. 595, 599 (Bankr. W.D.Tex.2007); <i>In re Brickey,</i> 363 B.R. at 64-65 (Bankr.N.D.N.Y.2007); <i>In re Calhoun,</i> 359 B.R. 738, 740 (Bankr.E.D.Mo. 2007). That view reads into the filing deadline a restriction on bankruptcy courts' authority gleaned by implication from the \"automatic dismissal\" provision.</p>\n<p>Neither reading satisfies both head and heart in equal measure. The former (more flexible) reading honors the policy behind the Act by vesting bankruptcy <span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> courts with greater discretion to discourage bankruptcy abuse. Because any party in interest may request an order of automatic dismissal, debtors with something to hide are liable to treat dismissal as an escape hatch to be opened as needed. <i>See </i><i>Parker,</i> 351 B.R. at 802; <i>see also </i><i>Hall,</i> 368 B.R. at 602 (dismissing case on motion of debtor whom court describes as \"the poster child for a bad faith debtor\"). In such cases, the court has no occasion to address non-disclosure until long after the forty-five-day period has elapsed. That timetable rubs uneasily against the strictures of an inflexible reading  and bankruptcy courts are, after all, courts of equity.</p>\n<p>But the story has another side. The stricter reading of the statute, though inflexible, gives sharper teeth to the automatic dismissal provision. It ensures that dismissal at a party's request is all but guaranteed once the forty-five days have passed. Given Congress's concern with \"the recent escalation of consumer bankruptcy filings,\" H.R.Rep. No. 109-31, at 3-4, reprinted in 2005 U.S.C.C.A.N. 90, it can be argued that the stricter reading has some implicit support in the legislative history. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Warren,</i> 378 B.R. at 647; <i>see also </i><i>Rivera,</i> 376 B.R. at 386 (voicing concern that retroactive relief from the filing requirement \"would render the automatic dismissal provision in § 521(i) meaningless\").</p>\n<p>This position has a certain superficial appeal. Still, we must caution against trying to stretch a morsel into a meal. The amendments to section 521 are part of an abuse-prevention package. With Congress's core purpose in mind, we are reluctant to read into the statute by implication a new limit on judicial discretion that would encourage rather than discourage bankruptcy abuse. It is safe to say that Congress, in enacting BAPCPA, was not bent on placing additional weapons in the hands of abusive debtors.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>In all events, we believe that it is possible to give effect to all of section 521, preserving the bankruptcy court's discretion to forgive compliance with disclosure requirements after the fact while at the same time preserving the authentic value of automatic dismissal. When a party moves under section 521(i)(2) for the entry of an order dismissing an incomplete petition, the court can do one of three things: dismiss the case, decline to dismiss the case if the good-faith exception for payment advices applies, <i>see supra</i> note 2; or determine, in its discretion, that the missing information is <i>not</i> \"required under subsection (a)(1).\" 11 U.S.C. § 521(i)(1). In the last-mentioned event, the court can deny the motion to dismiss. Some courts in \"strict\" jurisdictions seem to assume that the second and third of these options cover the same ground. That thinking underlies the opinions construing the forty-five-day deadline for automatic dismissal as an implicit temporal limitation upon the court's authority to order otherwise. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Spencer,</i> 388 B.R. at 422; <i>Warren,</i> 378 B.R. at 646; <i>Hall,</i> 368 B.R. at 599; <i>Brickey,</i> 363 B.R. at 64-65; <i>Calhoun,</i> 359 B.R. at 740.</p>\n<p>We find that mechanical reading unwise. While it may be textually plausible, it fails to harmonize the letter and purpose of the statute. There is another, equally plausible reading  a reading that avoids this vice.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> The approach that we endorse recognizes that missing information may or may not be required, in a practical sense, depending upon what is deemed material by the court many months (or even years) after the bankruptcy petition has been filed. This would seem to be a likely reason for Congress to have entrusted the bankruptcy court with discretion to modify disclosure requirements on the fly. Where, as here, a previously hidden asset has more than enough value to cover the entire universe of creditors' claims, dollar for dollar, dispensing with the disclosure of statements reflecting payment advices and/or monthly net income is both pragmatic and reasonable. Common sense suggests that Congress never intended to strip the bankruptcy court of the flexibility needed to respond intelligently to the emergence of such a circumstance after the forty-five-day filing deadline has expired.</p>\n<p>This intuition is reinforced by our certain knowledge that this degree of flexibility existed in the Bankruptcy Code prior to BAPCPA's passage. As we have said, BAPCPA did not expressly curtail this aspect of the bankruptcy court's authority and, given the practical realities, we are reluctant to step in where Congress has elected not to tread. Automatic dismissal may be a new twist, but the importance of the judiciary's ability to assess needs and respond to exigencies free of artificial constraints has not changed. In our view, Congress must have recognized that bankruptcy courts would still need a meaningful opportunity to gauge whether missing information is \"required\" in a particular case. We conclude, therefore, that when the missing information has become irrelevant or extraneous and the court, in lieu of dismissal on that account, \"order[s] otherwise,\" section 521(i) does not compel dismissal of the case.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>On the same reasoning, we also reject the assertion that the exceptions to automatic dismissal contained in section 521(i), <i>see supra</i> note 2, were meant to supplant the bankruptcy court's discretion to order otherwise more than forty-five days after the filing date. Those exceptions apply when the court does not choose to waive the disclosure requirement either ex ante or ex post; they do not apply when the court does so elect. So understood, the exceptions operate within their own statutory ambit and do not cabin the bankruptcy court's discretion in other areas.</p>\n<p>Let us be perfectly clear. We do not decide today whether bankruptcy courts possess unfettered discretion to waive the disclosure requirements ex post. Where, however, there is no continuing need for the information or a waiver is needed to prevent automatic dismissal from furthering a debtor's abusive conduct, the court has discretion to take such an action. This case is of that genre.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>To sum up, the great divide in section 521 is between information that is required and information that is not. The Act allows courts to do the sifting suggested by that divide without rigid adherence to the forty-five-day deadline.</p>\n<p>We need go no further. In this case the bankruptcy court, acting with care and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> restraint, was faithful to the evolving statutory scheme. Its order was, therefore, within the compass of its discretion.</p>\n<p><i>The judgment of the district court is reversed and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  In brief, a Chapter 13 bankruptcy allows individuals who have a regular source of income to submit to the bankruptcy court a plan to repay all or part of their debts over a three to five year period. During the repayment period creditors are stayed from starting or continuing collection efforts. <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. §§ 1321-1330. Chapter 7 is a liquidation. <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. §§ 701-784. A bankruptcy trustee collects and sells the debtor's non-exempt assets and uses those proceeds to pay creditors.</p>\n<p>[2]  The automatic dismissal deadline can be extended by another forty-five days upon timely request. <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. § 521(i)(3). Moreover, the automatic dismissal provision is subject to an explicit statutory exception: a timely motion by the trustee to forestall dismissal based on the best interests of the creditors and the debtors' good-faith efforts to effect the required filing. <i>Id.</i> § 521(i)(1), (4). That exception does not apply here.</p>\n<p>[3]  A few courts have conceptualized dismissal under this section as a matter involving only the counting of the days. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>In re Fawson,</i> 338 B.R. 505, 510 (Bankr.D.Utah 2006). To decide this case, we need not resolve that question.</p>\n<p>[4]  Although not explicitly mentioned, the court evidently meant to excuse as well the filing of the monthly net income statement. We proceed on that assumption.</p>\n<p>[5]  Only the United States Trustee filed an answering brief in the district court. That court, however, designated both the United States Trustee and the Chapter 7 trustee as appellees. The Chapter 7 trustee has taken the instant appeal. We are satisfied that he has standing to do so.</p>\n<p>[6]  The pre-BAPCPA version of section 521(1) provided:\n</p>\n<p>The Debtor shall . . . file a list of creditors, and unless the court orders otherwise, a schedule of assets and liabilities, a schedule of current income and current expenditures, and a statement of the debtor's financial affairs.</p>\n<p>[7]  By definition, such debtors are unfit for the \"good faith\" exception in section 521(i)(4). <i>See supra</i> note 2. Moreover, under 11 U.S.C. § 707(a), a chapter 7 debtor has no absolute right to dismiss his petition but must instead show cause. <i>See </i><i>In re Smith,</i> 507 F.3d 64, 72 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>[8]  To be sure, the time line for the entry of an order of automatic dismissal suggests an impatience with delay. When a party in interest requests dismissal and the case is one that falls within section 521(i)(1), \"the court shall enter an order of dismissal not later than 5 days after such request.\" 11 U.S.C. § 521(i)(2). Nothing in our holding today diminishes this mandate.</p>\n<p>[9]  It would serve no useful purpose for us to attempt to sketch the full range of circumstances that might justify the exercise of this discretion.</p>\n\n</div>",

After several further amendments (not material here), the debtors valued the chose in action at $2,700,000 and claimed an exemption of $350,000.</p>\n<p>Eventually, the Chapter 7 trustee moved for leave to settle the suit for $200,000 (a sum that would have generated enough cash to pay all allowed claims and produce some surplus funds for the debtors). Balking at this proposal, the debtors moved under the automatic dismissal provision, 11 U.S.C. § 521(i)(2), to confirm the dismissal of their petition. In support of their motion, they claimed not to have filed or otherwise provided the payment advices and statement of monthly net income required by BAPCPA. As their attorney acknowledged, the debtors wanted to dismiss the bankruptcy case so that they could \"continue prosecuting the state court action\" for damages.</p>\n<p>We pause at this juncture to discuss the Act's \"automatic dismissal\" provision. When a debtor fails to file all the information required by section 521(a)(1)(B) within the prescribed period  that is, within forty-five days of the filing date of the bankruptcy petition  BAPCPA provides that \"the case shall be automatically dismissed.\"<sup>[2]</sup> 11 U.S.C. § 521(i)(1). The term \"automatic dismissal\" is something of a misnomer. Typically, dismissal under this provision takes place at the instance of a \"party in interest.\" <i>Id.</i> § 521(i)(2); <i>see, e.g., </i><i>In re Spencer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1544773\"><a href=\"/opinion/1544773/in-re-spencer/\"><span class=\"volume\">388</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">418</span></a></span>, 421 (Bankr.D.D.C.2008). Dismissal is, therefore, hardly \"automatic.\"<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>We return to what transpired below. In due season, the bankruptcy court denied the debtors' motion to dismiss, finding that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> \"facts peculiar to this case do not require dismissal under section 521.\" In support, the court noted that the debtors' motion stemmed from their \"disagreement with the proposed settlement.\" That was significant because the putative settlement would have satisfied all allowed claims; thus, neither the creditors nor the trustee needed the missing (undisclosed) information. Based on that reasoning, the court entered \"an order nunc pro tunc ... excusing the debtors from filing the payment advices mentioned in section 521(a)(1)(B)(iv).\"<sup>[4]</sup> In short, the court excused the detailed disclosure by ordering the debtors to do \"otherwise\" under section 521(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p>In a subsequent order, the court approved the trustee's revised recommendation to settle the discrimination case for $600,000, citing the likelihood of delay from further litigation, uncertainties surrounding collection, and the fact that Acosta-Rivera stood to receive nearly $400,000, less mortgage arrearages, after the allowed claims were paid.</p>\n<p>The debtors appealed the denial of their motion to dismiss to the district court. The district judge ruled that the bankruptcy court lacked authority to excuse compliance with the disclosure requirement more than forty-five days after the debtors filed their bankruptcy petition. <i>See </i><i>Rivera,</i> 376 B.R. at 386. In the judge's view, the strictures of the Act left the bankruptcy judge \"with no discretion to fashion any reasonable or equitable solution.\" <i>Id.</i> at 386-87. The judge stated: \"`After the expiration of the specified period set forth in 11 U.S.C. § 521(i)(1), there are no exceptions, no excuses, only dismissal and the consequences that flow therefrom.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 386 (quoting <i>In re Ott,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1932612\"><a href=\"/opinion/1932612/in-re-ott/\"><span class=\"volume\">343</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">264</span></a></span>, 268 (Bankr.D.Colo.2006)). This timely appeal followed.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Some preliminary pruning is in order. The Chapter 7 trustee devotes much of his brief to General Order 05-06 of the bankruptcy court, which directs debtors not to file the payment advices required by section 521(a)(1)(B)(iv), but, rather, to provide them to the trustee and interested creditors. The general order further provides that \"[f]ailure of debtor to comply with the requirements of 11 U.S.C. § 521(a)(1)(B)(iv)\"  presumably as adjusted by the general order  \"will result in automatic dismissal under section 521(i)(1).\" This general order is standard fare: bankruptcy courts in numerous districts have adopted comparable orders. <i>See </i><i>In re Brickey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1536128\"><a href=\"/opinion/1536128/in-re-brickey/\"><span class=\"volume\">363</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span>, 64 &amp; n. 4 (Bankr. N.D.N.Y. 2007).</p>\n<p>Neither the bankruptcy court nor the district court mentioned General Order 05-06. Moreover, even if the debtors had complied with this general order  a circumstance that the record does not document and that the debtors deny  the statutory issue would persist. By its terms, the general order is limited to the payment advices required by section 521(a)(1)(B)(iv); it does not mitigate the debtors' duty to file the statement of monthly net income required by section 521(a)(1)(B)(v).</p>\n<p>The trustee has yet another new argument. For the first time, he suggests that the debtors filed the functional equivalent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> of a monthly net income statement in the form of Schedule J. This is too little and too late.</p>\n<p>Schedule J deals with a debtor's current expenditures. In the process, it responds to a different filing requirement, contained in 11 U.S.C. § 521(a)(1)(B)(ii). Although line 20 of Schedule J is called a \"Statement of Monthly Net Income\" and the advisory committee note to the official bankruptcy forms states that this line was added to Schedule J in 2005 \"as required by § 521(a)(1)(B)(v),\" there is no reason to think that Schedule J is a proxy for the statement of current monthly income required by section 521(a)(1)(B)(v). In fact, the case law suggests the opposite conclusion. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>In re Turner,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1812861\"><a href=\"/opinion/1812861/in-re-turner/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">852</span></a></span>, 856 (Bankr. D.Colo.2008) (holding that a Chapter 7 debtor's duty to file a section 521(a)(1)(B)(v) statement of monthly net income \"can only be fulfilled by filing\" Form B22A).</p>\n<p>We need not probe this point too deeply. Whether Schedule J can ever serve double duty in a given case is not before us. Suffice it to say that, in this instance, we will not entertain the trustee's forfeited argument. <i>See </i><i>Teamsters Union Local No. 59 v. Superline Transp. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"575211\"><a href=\"/opinion/575211/teamsters-chauffeurs-warehousemen-and-helpers-union-local-no-59-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 21 (1st Cir.1992) (\"If any principle is settled in this circuit, it is that, absent the most extraordinary circumstances, legal theories not squarely raised in the lower court cannot be broached for the first time on appeal.\").</p>\n<p>Having cleared away the underbrush, what remains is the question of the bankruptcy court's authority to waive the disclosure requirement after the expiration of the filing deadline. The statute provides that the debtor \"shall ... file\" the required disclosures \"unless the court orders otherwise.\" 11 U.S.C. § 521(a)(1)(B). The grant of judicial power to \"order[] otherwise\" predated BAPCPA.<sup>[6]</sup> In overhauling section 521, Congress left this familiar language intact. We do not regard that as a mere fortuity. Nor do we think that a slip of the pen accounts for the fact that the provision does not now contain an explicit deadline for ordering otherwise. In this context, we have a high regard for congressional silence.</p>\n<p>Sharing this regard, a few courts have held that the bankruptcy court possesses authority to waive the disclosure requirement even after the forty-five-day filing deadline has expired. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>In re Parker,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1804238\"><a href=\"/opinion/1804238/in-re-parker/\"><span class=\"volume\">351</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">790</span></a></span>, 801-02 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 2006); <i>In re Jackson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2019496\"><a href=\"/opinion/2019496/in-re-jackson/\"><span class=\"volume\">348</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">487</span></a></span>, 499-500 (Bankr. S.D. Iowa 2006); <i>cf. </i><i>In re Bonner,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1550734\"><a href=\"/opinion/1550734/in-re-bonner/\"><span class=\"volume\">374</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></a></span>, 64-65 (Bankr.W.D.N.Y. 2007) (suggesting that \"special circumstances can justify <i>nunc pro tunc</i> relief\" under section 521(i)). Other courts, however, have taken the view that BAPCPA's new forty-five-day deadline applies to courts and debtors alike. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>In re Spencer,</i> 388 B.R. at 422; <i>Warren v. Wirum,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2025819\"><a href=\"/opinion/2025819/warren-v-wirum/\"><span class=\"volume\">378</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span>, 647 (N.D.Cal.2007); <i>In re Hall,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1954072\"><a href=\"/opinion/1954072/in-re-hall/\"><span class=\"volume\">368</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">595</span></a></span>, 599 (Bankr. W.D.Tex.2007); <i>In re Brickey,</i> 363 B.R. at 64-65 (Bankr.N.D.N.Y.2007); <i>In re Calhoun,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1870161\"><a href=\"/opinion/1870161/in-re-calhoun/\"><span class=\"volume\">359</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></a></span>, 740 (Bankr.E.D.Mo. 2007). That view reads into the filing deadline a restriction on bankruptcy courts' authority gleaned by implication from the \"automatic dismissal\" provision.</p>\n<p>Neither reading satisfies both head and heart in equal measure. The former (more flexible) reading honors the policy behind the Act by vesting bankruptcy <span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> courts with greater discretion to discourage bankruptcy abuse. Because any party in interest may request an order of automatic dismissal, debtors with something to hide are liable to treat dismissal as an escape hatch to be opened as needed. <i>See </i><i>Parker,</i> 351 B.R. at 802; <i>see also </i><i>Hall,</i> 368 B.R. at 602 (dismissing case on motion of debtor whom court describes as \"the poster child for a bad faith debtor\"). In such cases, the court has no occasion to address non-disclosure until long after the forty-five-day period has elapsed. That timetable rubs uneasily against the strictures of an inflexible reading  and bankruptcy courts are, after all, courts of equity.</p>\n<p>But the story has another side. The stricter reading of the statute, though inflexible, gives sharper teeth to the automatic dismissal provision. It ensures that dismissal at a party's request is all but guaranteed once the forty-five days have passed. Given Congress's concern with \"the recent escalation of consumer bankruptcy filings,\" H.R.Rep. No. 109-31, at 3-4, reprinted in 2005 U.S.C.C.A.N. 90, it can be argued that the stricter reading has some implicit support in the legislative history. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Warren,</i> 378 B.R. at 647; <i>see also </i><i>Rivera,</i> 376 B.R. at 386 (voicing concern that retroactive relief from the filing requirement \"would render the automatic dismissal provision in § 521(i) meaningless\").</p>\n<p>This position has a certain superficial appeal. Still, we must caution against trying to stretch a morsel into a meal. The amendments to section 521 are part of an abuse-prevention package. With Congress's core purpose in mind, we are reluctant to read into the statute by implication a new limit on judicial discretion that would encourage rather than discourage bankruptcy abuse. It is safe to say that Congress, in enacting BAPCPA, was not bent on placing additional weapons in the hands of abusive debtors.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>In all events, we believe that it is possible to give effect to all of section 521, preserving the bankruptcy court's discretion to forgive compliance with disclosure requirements after the fact while at the same time preserving the authentic value of automatic dismissal. When a party moves under section 521(i)(2) for the entry of an order dismissing an incomplete petition, the court can do one of three things: dismiss the case, decline to dismiss the case if the good-faith exception for payment advices applies, <i>see supra</i> note 2; or determine, in its discretion, that the missing information is <i>not</i> \"required under subsection (a)(1).\" 11 U.S.C. § 521(i)(1). In the last-mentioned event, the court can deny the motion to dismiss. Some courts in \"strict\" jurisdictions seem to assume that the second and third of these options cover the same ground. That thinking underlies the opinions construing the forty-five-day deadline for automatic dismissal as an implicit temporal limitation upon the court's authority to order otherwise. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Spencer,</i> 388 B.R. at 422; <i>Warren,</i> 378 B.R. at 646; <i>Hall,</i> 368 B.R. at 599; <i>Brickey,</i> 363 B.R. at 64-65; <i>Calhoun,</i> 359 B.R. at 740.</p>\n<p>We find that mechanical reading unwise. While it may be textually plausible, it fails to harmonize the letter and purpose of the statute. There is another, equally plausible reading  a reading that avoids this vice.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> The approach that we endorse recognizes that missing information may or may not be required, in a practical sense, depending upon what is deemed material by the court many months (or even years) after the bankruptcy petition has been filed. This would seem to be a likely reason for Congress to have entrusted the bankruptcy court with discretion to modify disclosure requirements on the fly. Where, as here, a previously hidden asset has more than enough value to cover the entire universe of creditors' claims, dollar for dollar, dispensing with the disclosure of statements reflecting payment advices and/or monthly net income is both pragmatic and reasonable. Common sense suggests that Congress never intended to strip the bankruptcy court of the flexibility needed to respond intelligently to the emergence of such a circumstance after the forty-five-day filing deadline has expired.</p>\n<p>This intuition is reinforced by our certain knowledge that this degree of flexibility existed in the Bankruptcy Code prior to BAPCPA's passage. As we have said, BAPCPA did not expressly curtail this aspect of the bankruptcy court's authority and, given the practical realities, we are reluctant to step in where Congress has elected not to tread. Automatic dismissal may be a new twist, but the importance of the judiciary's ability to assess needs and respond to exigencies free of artificial constraints has not changed. In our view, Congress must have recognized that bankruptcy courts would still need a meaningful opportunity to gauge whether missing information is \"required\" in a particular case. We conclude, therefore, that when the missing information has become irrelevant or extraneous and the court, in lieu of dismissal on that account, \"order[s] otherwise,\" section 521(i) does not compel dismissal of the case.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>On the same reasoning, we also reject the assertion that the exceptions to automatic dismissal contained in section 521(i), <i>see supra</i> note 2, were meant to supplant the bankruptcy court's discretion to order otherwise more than forty-five days after the filing date. Those exceptions apply when the court does not choose to waive the disclosure requirement either ex ante or ex post; they do not apply when the court does so elect. So understood, the exceptions operate within their own statutory ambit and do not cabin the bankruptcy court's discretion in other areas.</p>\n<p>Let us be perfectly clear. We do not decide today whether bankruptcy courts possess unfettered discretion to waive the disclosure requirements ex post. Where, however, there is no continuing need for the information or a waiver is needed to prevent automatic dismissal from furthering a debtor's abusive conduct, the court has discretion to take such an action. This case is of that genre.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>To sum up, the great divide in section 521 is between information that is required and information that is not. The Act allows courts to do the sifting suggested by that divide without rigid adherence to the forty-five-day deadline.</p>\n<p>We need go no further. In this case the bankruptcy court, acting with care and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> restraint, was faithful to the evolving statutory scheme. Its order was, therefore, within the compass of its discretion.</p>\n<p><i>The judgment of the district court is reversed and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  In brief, a Chapter 13 bankruptcy allows individuals who have a regular source of income to submit to the bankruptcy court a plan to repay all or part of their debts over a three to five year period. During the repayment period creditors are stayed from starting or continuing collection efforts. <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. §§ 1321-1330. Chapter 7 is a liquidation. <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. §§ 701-784. A bankruptcy trustee collects and sells the debtor's non-exempt assets and uses those proceeds to pay creditors.</p>\n<p>[2]  The automatic dismissal deadline can be extended by another forty-five days upon timely request. <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. § 521(i)(3). Moreover, the automatic dismissal provision is subject to an explicit statutory exception: a timely motion by the trustee to forestall dismissal based on the best interests of the creditors and the debtors' good-faith efforts to effect the required filing. <i>Id.</i> § 521(i)(1), (4). That exception does not apply here.</p>\n<p>[3]  A few courts have conceptualized dismissal under this section as a matter involving only the counting of the days. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>In re Fawson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1529352\"><a href=\"/opinion/1529352/in-re-fawson/\"><span class=\"volume\">338</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">505</span></a></span>, 510 (Bankr.D.Utah 2006). To decide this case, we need not resolve that question.</p>\n<p>[4]  Although not explicitly mentioned, the court evidently meant to excuse as well the filing of the monthly net income statement. We proceed on that assumption.</p>\n<p>[5]  Only the United States Trustee filed an answering brief in the district court. That court, however, designated both the United States Trustee and the Chapter 7 trustee as appellees. The Chapter 7 trustee has taken the instant appeal. We are satisfied that he has standing to do so.</p>\n<p>[6]  The pre-BAPCPA version of section 521(1) provided:\n</p>\n<p>The Debtor shall . . . file a list of creditors, and unless the court orders otherwise, a schedule of assets and liabilities, a schedule of current income and current expenditures, and a statement of the debtor's financial affairs.</p>\n<p>[7]  By definition, such debtors are unfit for the \"good faith\" exception in section 521(i)(4). <i>See supra</i> note 2. Moreover, under 11 U.S.C. § 707(a), a chapter 7 debtor has no absolute right to dismiss his petition but must instead show cause. <i>See </i><i>In re Smith,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1435190\"><a href=\"/opinion/1435190/in-re-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span>, 72 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>[8]  To be sure, the time line for the entry of an order of automatic dismissal suggests an impatience with delay. When a party in interest requests dismissal and the case is one that falls within section 521(i)(1), \"the court shall enter an order of dismissal not later than 5 days after such request.\" 11 U.S.C. § 521(i)(2). Nothing in our holding today diminishes this mandate.</p>\n<p>[9]  It would serve no useful purpose for us to attempt to sketch the full range of circumstances that might justify the exercise of this discretion.</p>\n\n</div>",
