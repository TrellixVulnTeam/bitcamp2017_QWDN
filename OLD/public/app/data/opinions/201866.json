He\n\nnow appeals, arguing that (1) there was insufficient evidence to\n\nsupport the jury verdict, (2) the district court's jury instruction\n\non reasonable doubt constituted plain error, (3) the district court\n\nabused its discretion in denying his motion to exclude certain\n\nevidence, and (4) the district court erred in not striking, sua\n\nsponte, certain statements made by the prosecution during closing\n\nargument.    We affirm.\n\n                            I.   Background\n\n            Because O'Shea was convicted, we review the facts in the\n\nlight most favorable to the verdict. See United States v. Mercado,\n\n412 F.3d 243, 245 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            On January 22, 2002, shortly before 2:00 PM, Daniel Woods\n\n(\"Woods\") exited the Best Western Roundhouse Suites Hotel at 891\n\nMassachusetts Avenue in Boston, Massachusetts.    Woods got into his\n\ncar and made a call on his cellular phone.    As he made the call, a\n\nblack sport utility vehicle (\"SUV\") pulled up behind his car and\n\nblocked him in. A white male approximately twenty-eight to thirty-\n\none years old, with a shamrock tattoo on the right side of his\n\nneck, and wearing a black nylon jacket, a dark cap, and blue jeans\n\ngot out of the driver's seat.    The man approached the driver's side\n\nof Woods car, pointed a shiny silver revolver at Woods's head\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fthrough the open window and demanded \"the hotel receipts.\" The man\n\nalso demanded that Woods open his trunk, and Woods complied. While\n\nthe man was searching the trunk, Woods observed a passenger in the\n\nSUV.   The man took around $100 from Woods, got back into the SUV,\n\nand drove away with the passenger.\n\n            Woods, who had written down the SUV's license plate\n\nnumber, immediately reported the robbery to the police, who radioed\n\nthe information to other officers.          Less than one minute after\n\nreceiving    the   transmission,   Boston    police   officers   Richard\n\nRackauskas (\"Rackauskas\") and Edward Norton (\"Norton\") spotted the\n\nSUV on Dorchester Avenue as they were traveling to the crime scene.\n\nThey followed the SUV and turned on their lights and sirens.        The\n\nSUV did not stop, and it eventually reached the intersection of\n\nButtonwood Street and Columbia Road, where it entered Columbia Road\n\ngoing the wrong direction.1        The police officers followed but\n\nstayed on the proper side of the road.          The SUV was closest to\n\nRackauskas, who was driving the patrol car.       The officers' car was\n\napproximately four car lengths behind the SUV.\n\n            Columbia Road goes underneath Interstate 93 (\"I-93\") and\n\nleads to a rotary.    Just before the SUV reached the I-93 overpass,\n\nRackauskas observed the SUV's passenger stick his arm out the\n\nwindow.   The passenger's arm had gray clothing on it.       Rackauskas\n\n\n\n1\n   Columbia Road is a six-lane road with three lanes going in each\ndirection, separated by a median.\n\n                                   -3-\n\fsaw a \"silver metallic shiny object\" in the passenger's hand and\n\nobserved the passenger waving his arm back and forth.             He told\n\nNorton that \"he's throwing something, there's something hanging out\n\nthe window, he's got something out the window.\"         Rackauskas only\n\nsaw the object for a few seconds, did not see anything come out of\n\nthe passenger's hand, and could not identify what the object was.\n\nNorton testified that he never saw an object and did not recall\n\nRackauskas saying anything about such an object.\n\n          The officers lost sight of the SUV for about fifteen\n\nseconds as it traveled underneath the overpass and entered the\n\nrotary going clockwise, i.e., in the wrong direction.2            However,\n\nthey saw it emerging from the rotary onto Old Colony Avenue and\n\ncontinued their pursuit.      The occupants of the SUV abandoned the\n\nvehicle outside the Maryellan McCormack housing projects and ran in\n\nfront of the patrol car -- which was between fifty to one hundred\n\nyards away -- into the housing development.     Rackauskas identified\n\nthe occupants as two white males: one wearing a black jacket, black\n\nhat, blue jeans, and sneakers; the other wearing a blue and grey\n\nsweatshirt,   blue   jeans,   and   sneakers.   The   men   ran   into   an\n\napartment building at 433 Old Colony Avenue.             Rackauskas and\n\nNorton, joined by another policeman, Officer Daniel Ryan (\"Ryan\"),\n\nsaw the suspects enter the apartment building.        All three officers\n\n\n2\n   Since the SUV entered the rotary going clockwise, the passenger\nside was closest to the rotary's interior, which is where the gun\nat issue was eventually found.\n\n                                    -4-\n\finitially entered the building, but Rackauskas quickly exited to\n\ncover the windows.\n\n            The two suspects entered the second floor apartment of\n\nErnest Washburn (\"Washburn\"), who was home at the time.                As Norton\n\nand Ryan banged on the door, one of the suspects begged Washburn\n\nnot to open the door.         Washburn opened the door, however, and the\n\nsuspects jumped out of a window into the courtyard below.                 In the\n\nmeantime, Rackauskas had gone around to the back of the building\n\nwhere the courtyard was located.           He saw O'Shea, who was dressed in\n\na   blue   and     grey     sweatshirt,    jeans,    and   sneakers,   limping.\n\nRackauskas ordered O'Shea to stop.              O'Shea initially did not obey\n\nbut eventually surrendered.             Soon afterwards, the officers found\n\nthe other suspect, Kevin Kelley (\"Kelley\"), in a nearby apartment\n\nbuilding.    Kelly was wearing a black jacket, had a tattoo on his\n\nneck, and was also limping.\n\n            Because the dispatch had reported that a silver handgun\n\nwas used in the robbery, the police searched Kelley and O'Shea, the\n\nMaryellan McCormick housing project, and the SUV for the weapon.\n\nThey did not find a firearm, but found an empty holster in plain\n\nview sitting by the center console between the two front seats.\n\nRackauskas       directed     another    policeman,    Officer   Robert    Lucas\n\n(\"Lucas\"), to search the area around I-93 leading to the rotary.\n\nOfficer Lucas searched the interior island of the rotary and found\n\na silver handgun laying on the ground with nothing on top of it.\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\f            On March 26, 2003, a grand jury issued a superseding\n\nindictment charging O'Shea with being a felon in possession of a\n\nfirearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. ยง 922(g).     To convict under ยง 922\n\n(g), a jury must to find that a defendant (1) has previously been\n\nconvicted of a crime punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding\n\none year, and (2) has knowingly possessed a firearm, (3) that was\n\nin   or   affected   interstate   commerce.    See   United   States   v.\n\nCarpenter, 403 F.3d 9, 10 (1st Cir. 2005).     The parties stipulated\n\nthat O'Shea was a felon and that the gun found at the rotary had\n\ntraveled in interstate commerce. The only issue at trial therefore\n\nwas whether O'Shea had knowingly possessed the firearm.\n\n            After a four-day trial in the United States District\n\nCourt for the District of Massachusetts, a jury convicted O'Shea.\n\nOn January 16, 2004, the district court sentenced O'Shea to 180\n\nmonths imprisonment.     O'Shea appealed on January 27, 2004.\n\n                            II.   Discussion\n\nA.   Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n            At the close of evidence, O'Shea filed a motion for\n\njudgment of acquittal pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(a), arguing\n\nthat the evidence was insufficient to prove that he had knowingly\n\nand intentionally possessed the firearm. The district court denied\n\n\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fthe motion.3    After the jury verdict, O'Shea again filed a Rule 29\n\nmotion, which the district court denied.\n\n          We review de novo the denial of a Rule 29 motion for\n\nacquittal.     United States v. Mercado Irizarry, 404 F.3d 497, 503\n\n(1st Cir. 2005). \"In doing so we must decide, viewing the evidence\n\nin the light most favorable to the verdict of guilt, whether a\n\nreasonable factfinder could find the defendant guilty of the crime\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\"       Id.   This standard of review is\n\n\"formidable,\" United States v. Loder, 23 F.3d 586, 589 (1st Cir.\n\n1994), and \"[d]efendants challenging convictions for insufficiency\n\nof evidence face an uphill battle on appeal.\"      United States v.\n\nHernรกndez, 218 F.3d 58, 64 (1st Cir. 2000).    In our review of Rule\n\n29 determinations, \"'no premium is placed upon direct as opposed to\n\ncircumstantial evidence; both types of proof can adequately ground\n\na conviction.'\" Id. (quoting United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707,\n\n711 (1st Cir. 1992)).\n\n          O'Shea argues that the district court erred in denying\n\nhis Rule 29 motions because there is no evidence, direct or\n\ncircumstantial, to support his conviction.        He asserts that,\n\nalthough he was observed in the passenger seat of the SUV, there\n\nwas no evidence linking him to the initial robbery at the Best\n\n\n3\n   The district court did rule that the evidence was insufficient\nto find that O'Shea constructively possessed the firearm during the\nrobbery, which was one of the government's theories of the case.\nAccordingly, the district court only instructed the jury on actual\npossession.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fWestern, he was never seen with the gun in his hand, and the silver\n\nobject seen by Rackauskas could have been anything, something\n\nRackauskas admitted on cross-examination.           O'Shea also notes that\n\nthe   gun   was   located   \"a   good   distance\"   from   where   Rackauskas\n\nobserved the shiny metal object in the SUV passenger's hand.\n\n            The government argues that there was ample evidence for\n\nthe jury to conclude that O'Shea was with Kelley when Kelley robbed\n\nWoods and that O'Shea threw the silver firearm used in the robbery\n\nout the SUV's window as the police chased him and Kelley.            We agree\n\nthat the government has proven its case.             There was sufficient\n\nevidence for the jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that\n\nO'Shea possessed the firearm in the SUV.\n\n            The evidence supports the conclusion that O'Shea was the\n\npassenger in the SUV when Kelley robbed Woods with a silver\n\nhandgun.    Woods testified that he saw a passenger in the SUV as he\n\nwas being robbed and that he called the police as soon as the SUV\n\ndrove off.    The report was immediately sent to officers over the\n\nradio, and Rackauskas and Norton spotted the SUV less than one\n\nminute after receiving the dispatch.           It was reasonable for the\n\njury to conclude that the passenger in the SUV when Woods was\n\nrobbed was the same passenger in the SUV when the officers spotted\n\nthe vehicle minutes later.\n\n            Thus, it was also reasonable for the jury to conclude\n\nthat this was the same passenger whom Rackauskas saw wave his arm\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fout the window while holding a shiny metallic object, and the same\n\npassenger the officers saw exit the SUV and run into the housing\n\nproject.     And it was reasonable for the jury to conclude that\n\nO'Shea, who was apprehended beneath the window the two suspects had\n\njumped out of, was limping, and was wearing the same clothes as the\n\nman whom the officers observed running from the SUV, was this same\n\npassenger.\n\n           Against this backdrop, it was also reasonable for the\n\njury to conclude that the gun found on the rotary island was the\n\nsame gun used during the robbery.    The parties do not dispute that\n\na shiny silver revolver was used during the robbery, or that the\n\ngun found at the rotary was a shiny silver revolver.    After their\n\napprehension, a silver revolver was not found on either of the\n\nsuspects, in the housing project, or in the SUV, even though an\n\nempty holster was found in the SUV.     In light of these facts, it\n\nwas reasonable for the jury to conclude that the suspects rid\n\nthemselves of the firearm sometime between the robbery and when\n\nthey exited the SUV outside of the housing project.      This would\n\nleave two possibilities: (1) that the suspects disposed of the\n\nfirearm after the robbery but before they were spotted by the\n\npolice -- a dubious conclusion since the suspects would have had no\n\nmotive to dispose of the firearm at that time; or (2) that the\n\nsuspects disposed of the firearm after they were spotted, but did\n\nso when the officers were unable to see them.     Under this latter\n\n\n                               -9-\n\fpossibility, the jury could have reasonably concluded that the\n\nsuspects disposed of the firearm either somewhere in the housing\n\nprojects or during the period when the officers lost sight of the\n\nSUV once it entered the I-93 underpass.     However, a search of the\n\nhousing project turned up nothing, while a search of the area where\n\nthe suspects were when the police briefly lost sight of them\n\nrevealed a shiny silver revolver.      This revolver was found on the\n\nrotary island in the middle of the day, uncovered by any trash or\n\ndebris; in short, it did not appear to have been sitting there for\n\na long period of time.    The jury could have reasonably concluded\n\nthat this was the same revolver used during the robbery earlier\n\nthat day.\n\n            The jury also must have concluded that O'Shea possessed\n\nthis revolver.     We believe it could reasonably have done so.\n\nFirst, Rackauskas testified that he saw the passenger's arm out the\n\nwindow holding a shiny silver object.        O'Shea points out that\n\nNorton testified that he never saw the passenger throw an object\n\nfrom the car, never saw the SUV's window go up or down, and never\n\nsaw a shiny silver object, even though he was the passenger and\n\ncould pay more attention to the SUV than Rackauskas, who was\n\ndriving. However, Norton testified that he was handling the radio\n\nand watching cars in front of the patrol car and therefore did not\n\nhave his eyes on the SUV the entire time.        Further, Rackauskas\n\ntestified that he saw the metallic object for only a couple of\n\n\n                                -10-\n\fseconds.     The jury could easily have inferred that Norton simply\n\nwas not looking in the few seconds that Rackauskas observed the\n\nmetallic object.\n\n            O'Shea also makes much of the fact that Rackauskas saw\n\nthe object before the SUV went beneath the overpass, while the\n\nrevolver was found on the other side of the overpass on the rotary\n\nisland.     However, as Rackauskas testified, the time from when the\n\nofficers lost sight of the SUV to the time they saw it again\n\nexiting the rotary spanned only fifteen seconds. Further, it makes\n\nsense that O'Shea would have disposed of the firearm at a time when\n\nthe police could not see the SUV.          It also makes sense that he\n\nwould have disposed of the gun on the rotary island, hoping the\n\ngrass would hide the gun, rather than simply tossing it into the\n\nstreet.     Finally, the fact that the SUV entered the rotary going\n\nclockwise means that the rotary grass was on the passenger side of\n\nthe   SUV   and   therefore   nearest   O'Shea.   The   jury   could   have\n\nreasonably concluded that, in the fifteen-second window during\n\nwhich the police were out of sight, O'Shea tossed the gun into the\n\nrotary grass that was right next to his side of the car.\n\n            O'Shea also points out that Rackauskas admitted that the\n\nsilver object could have been anything, including a cell phone\n\nfound after the suspects' arrest.          He states that it is \"most\n\ncompelling\" that during deliberations the jury sent a note asking\n\nthe judge where the cell phone was found.               However, as the\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fgovernment notes, the cell phone was dark grey and plastic, not\n\nshiny and silver.      Further, the fact that the jury sent the note\n\nbut still convicted O'Shea simply indicates that the jury was doing\n\nits job.   It considered O'Shea's theory that the object could have\n\nbeen a cell phone but rejected it.\n\n           O'Shea devotes considerable attention to our decision in\n\nUnited States v. Luciano-Mosquera, 63 F.3d 1142 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\nHowever,   we   do   not   believe   that   case    is   helpful   to   O'Shea.\n\nLuciano-Mosquera involved several defendants engaged in a drug\n\nsmuggling operation.       The police conducted a sting operation and\n\ntwo of the defendants, Luciano-Mosquera and Pava-Buelba, were found\n\nunder a jeep that had a M-16 concealed in the chassis.                  Another\n\ndefendant, Lugo-Maya, was captured on a yawl as he headed out to\n\nsea.   The yawl was found to have 50 rounds of ammunition.              All of\n\nthe appellants were convicted of possessing firearms during or in\n\nrelation to a drug trafficking crime.         We reversed the convictions\n\nof Pava-Buelba and Lugo-Maya, finding that there was no evidence\n\neither of them had possessed the gun.              The facts of the instant\n\ncase are quite different, however.          As we have already discussed,\n\nit was reasonable for the jury to conclude that O'Shea was the\n\npassenger in the SUV during the robbery, that the gun found at the\n\nrotary was the gun used during the robbery, that the gun found at\n\nthe rotary was the shiny silver object Rackauskas saw in O'Shea's\n\nhand just before the SUV went under I-93, and that O'Shea threw the\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fgun into the rotary grass in the roughly fifteen-second window in\n\nwhich the police lost sight of the SUV.          We therefore affirm the\n\ndistrict court's denial of O'Shea's Rule 29 motions.\n\nB.   The District Court's Reasonable Doubt Instruction\n\n           O'Shea    next   challenges    the    district   court's     jury\n\ninstructions on reasonable doubt. Because he did not object to the\n\ninstructions during his trial, we review for plain error.              See,\n\nUnited States v. Rodrรญguez-Marrero, 390 F.3d 1, 25 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nUnder plain error review, O'Shea must show that (1) there was an\n\nerror (2) that was clear or obvious, (3) affected his substantial\n\nrights, and (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or\n\npublic reputation of judicial proceedings.          See United States v.\n\nMedina-Martรญnez, 396 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           While    we   have   warned    against   attempts   to     define\n\n\"reasonable doubt,\" noting that \"most efforts at clarification\n\nresult in further obfuscation of the concept[,] . . . a district\n\ncourt does not necessarily commit reversible error by attempting to\n\ndefine the concept of reasonable doubt for the jury.\"                 United\n\nStates v. Andรบjar, 49 F.3d 16, 23 (1st Cir. 1995) (internal\n\nquotation marks and citation omitted).          Instead, reasonable doubt\n\ninstructions constitute reversible error \"when, taken as a whole,\n\nthey have a 'reasonable likelihood' of misleading the jury to\n\nbelieve that it can convict on some lesser standard of proof than\n\n\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\fthat required under the reasonable doubt standard.\"   United States\n\nv. Romero, 32 F.3d 641, 651 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n          In the instant case, the jury instructions at issue read\n\nas follows:\n\n          Now, I've told you that the burden of proof is\n          on the government to prove the defendant is\n          guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The burden\n          of proof has nothing to do with who called the\n          witnesses or offered documents into evidence.\n          It goes to the quality of the evidence.\n\n          And now I'm going to explain to you in more\n          detail this concept of reasonable doubt.\n\n          It is a strict and heavy burden, but it does\n          not mean that a defendant's guilt must be\n          proved beyond all possible doubt.     It does\n          require   that  the   evidence  exclude   any\n          reasonable doubt concerning a defendant's\n          guilt. A reasonable doubt may arise not only\n          from the evidence produced, but also from the\n          lack of evidence.\n\n          Reasonable doubt exists when after weighing\n          and considering all of the evidence, using\n          reason, common sense, jurors cannot say that\n          they have a settled conviction of the truth of\n          the charge. Of course, a defendant is never\n          to be convicted on suspicion or conjecture.\n          If, for example, you view the evidence in the\n          case as reasonably permitting either of two\n          conclusions, one, that the defendant is guilty\n          as charged, and the other that the defendant\n          is not guilty, you will find the defendant not\n          guilty.\n\n(emphasis added).   O'Shea takes issue with the three emphasized\n\nportions of the instructions, arguing that they likely misled the\n\njury as to the proper standard of proof.\n\n\n\n\n                              -14-\n\f              As to the first portion, we find no error, and certainly\n\nno error that was clear or obvious.                   O'Shea argues that the\n\ninstruction regarding \"the quality of evidence\" put on onus on the\n\ndefendant to present evidence. We disagree. If anything, the jury\n\nwould have interpreted the instruction as having the opposite\n\neffect.       First, the sentence that the burden \"has nothing to do\n\nwith    who    called    witnesses   or    offered    documents        in   evidence\"\n\nindicates that the jury should not consider who put on evidence,\n\nbut only the evidence itself, meaning that it should not consider\n\nthe fact that O'Shea did not introduce any evidence.                         Further,\n\nconsidering      other    portions    of   the   instruction,      there      was    no\n\nlikelihood that the jury misunderstood the government's burden.\n\nSee United States v. Ranney, 298 F.3d 74, 80 (1st Cir. 2002)\n\n(stating that, even if a district court gave an improper jury\n\ninstruction, \"we will affirm if in the light of the entire jury\n\ncharge    there    was    no     'reasonable     likelihood'      that      the   jury\n\nmisunderstood the government's burden\").              Elsewhere, the district\n\ncourt    stated    that    O'Shea    had    no   obligation       to    \"prove      his\n\ninnocence,\" and also specifically stated that O'Shea was not\n\nrequired \"to produce any evidence at all.\"\n\n              O'Shea's    next    argument     is    that   the    sentence       \"[a]\n\nreasonable doubt may arise . . . from the lack of evidence\"\n\nindicated to the jury that it could consider the fact that O'Shea\n\ndid not present any evidence when considering reasonable doubt. We\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\fdisagree, essentially for the same reasons as above.   If anything,\n\nthe jury would likely have interpreted that instruction as meaning\n\nthat a reasonable doubt could arise from evidence the government\n\ndid not present.4    It would make no sense if the instruction meant\n\nthat a reasonable doubt as to O'Shea's guilt could arise as a\n\nresult of O'Shea's lack of evidence.     In any event, the district\n\ncourt made it clear elsewhere in the instructions that O'Shea did\n\nnot have to prove anything and did not have to put on any evidence.\n\nWe therefore find no plain error.\n\n          Finally, O'Shea argues that the district court's \"two\n\nconclusions\" instruction comparing guilt and non-guilt lowered the\n\ngovernment's burden of proof to a civil preponderance of the\n\nevidence standard.    See Andรบjar, 49 F.3d at 24 (stating that \"due\n\nto the risks of misleading the jury, district courts should refrain\n\nwherever possible from using a 'guilt or innocence' comparison in\n\ntheir jury instructions\").    The district court in the instant case\n\nreferred to guilt or non-guilt, not guilt or innocence.       As we\n\nnoted in Ranney, where a court refers \"to guilt and non-guilt,\n\nrather than innocence, a term less susceptible to the lay response,\n\nwe find the instruction less troublesome.\"         298 F.3d at 79.\n\n\"Nevertheless, telling jurors that the question is one of guilt or\n\nnon-guilt, without more, could risk undercutting the government's\n\n\n\n4\n    For example, the government was unable to present direct\ntestimony that O'Shea threw the gun out of the SUV.\n\n                                 -16-\n\fburden by suggesting that the defendant is guilty if they do not\n\nthink he is not guilty.\"   Id. at 79-80.\n\n          Ranney involved a jury instruction very similar to the\n\none at issue here.   Id. at 79.   There, the district court \"repeated\n\nits instruction that the government was required to prove guilt\n\n'beyond a reasonable doubt' on some twenty-three occasions.\"       Id.\n\nat 80.   We affirmed because, taking the jury instructions as a\n\nwhole, there was no reasonable likelihood that the jury failed to\n\nunderstand the government's burden of proof.     Id.5   In the instant\n\ncase, the district court stated that the government was required to\n\nprove O'Shea's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt at least nineteen\n\ntimes.   Further, the district court gave a careful and cogent\n\ndiscussion of the presumption of innocence, made it clear that\n\nO'Shea did not have to prove anything or present any evidence, and\n\nstated on at least three occasions that the jury could not consider\n\nthe fact that O'Shea did not testify.     See Andรบjar, 49 F.3d at 24.\n\nThe district court also stated that \"[i]t is not sufficient for the\n\ngovernment to establish a probability, although a strong one, that\n\na fact charged is more likely than not.    That is not enough to meet\n\nthe burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\"         This statement\n\ndecreased the likelihood that the jury would have mistakenly\n\n\n\n5\n   In Ranney, we affirmed even though we were reviewing under the\nless stringent abuse of discretion standard because the defendant\nhad objected to the instruction. Id. Here, we are reviewing for\nplain error.\n\n                                  -17-\n\fbelieved   that   the   government's   burden   of   proof   was   a    civil\n\npreponderance standard.     Taken as a whole, the jury instructions\n\nleave no reasonable likelihood that the jury misunderstood the\n\ngovernment's burden.       We find no plain error in the district\n\ncourt's instructions.\n\nC.   Evidence of the Robbery\n\n           O'Shea's third argument is that the district court erred\n\nwhen it admitted evidence of the robbery because it was not\n\nrelevant and was unduly prejudicial.      The government counters that\n\nthe district court properly admitted the evidence because the\n\nevidence was highly relevant and its probative value substantially\n\noutweighed any prejudice to O'Shea.\n\n           Prior to trial, O'Shea filed a motion in limine to\n\nexclude any evidence pertaining to the robbery of Woods.               In the\n\nmotion, O'Shea argued that evidence of the robbery was not relevant\n\nunder Fed. R. Evid. 401 and that, even if relevant, the evidence's\n\nprobative value was substantially outweighed by its prejudicial\n\neffect under Fed. R. Evid. 403.          In denying the motion, the\n\ndistrict court stated that\n\n           I find that, generally, the armed robbery is\n           relevant to proving that there was a gun in\n           the SUV, creates an opportunity for Mr. O'Shea\n           to    possess    that    gun    actually    or\n           constructively.   It's also relevant to the\n           credibility of the police officers' testimony\n           regarding seeing a silver object held outside\n           the passenger side of the vehicle and the\n           government's claim that the gun found on the\n           roadway was previously in the SUV.\n\n                                  -18-\n\f           . . .\n\n           I don't think that the 911 call alone would be\n           sufficient because . . . the testimony that\n           Kelley was the driver in a circumstance where\n           it is now alleged there were two people in the\n           car -- as I recall, the 911 call didn't\n           discuss a second person -- is relevant to\n           prove that if Kelley was the driver, O'Shea\n           was the passenger, and if Rackauskas is to be\n           believed and something silver was held out the\n           window and the jury concludes that silver\n           thing was the gun that was later found, it\n           provides relevant and potentially important\n           evidence that Mr. O'Shea was the passenger and\n           the person who held the gun out the window\n           and, therefore, possessed it.\n\n           The district court also gave a limiting instruction to\n\nthe jury making it clear that the jury could not convict O'Shea\n\nsolely because they believed that he was present at the robbery:\n\n\"Mr. O'Shea is not charged with participating in a robbery . . .\n\nAnd you're not being asked did he participate in a robbery or was\n\nhe present for the robbery?            You're being asked whether the\n\ngovernment has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he possessed\n\nthe firearm described in the indictment.\"\n\n           We review a district court's decision to admit evidence\n\nfor abuse of discretion.       See United States v. Flemmi, 402 F.3d 79,\n\n86 (1st Cir. 2005).     The district court in this case did not abuse\n\nits discretion in admitting evidence of the robbery.\n\n           O'Shea's first argument is that evidence of the robbery\n\nwas in no way relevant to the issue of whether he possessed a\n\nfirearm.    We     disagree.   Under   the   Federal   Rules   of   Evidence,\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\f\"'[r]elevant evidence' means evidence having any tendency to make\n\nthe    existence    of   any   fact   that    is    of   consequence   to     the\n\ndetermination of the action more probable or less probable than it\n\nwould be without the evidence.\"              Fed. R. Evid. 401.         As the\n\ndistrict court noted, evidence of the robbery was relevant to\n\nproving that there was a gun in the SUV and created an opportunity\n\nfor O'Shea to actually possess the gun.             It was also relevant to\n\nthe government's claim that the gun found on the rotary was in the\n\nSUV.     Further,    the   evidence   of     the   robbery   was   relevant    to\n\nRackauskas's credibility regarding his testimony that he saw a\n\nsilver object held outside the passenger side of the SUV.              In other\n\nwords, evidence of the robbery makes it more likely than not that\n\nO'Shea was the passenger in the SUV, had the opportunity to possess\n\nthe gun, and had the motive and opportunity to throw the gun from\n\nthe SUV onto the rotary.6        We therefore agree with the district\n\ncourt that evidence of the robbery was relevant.\n\n            O'Shea's second argument is that the admitted evidence's\n\nprobative value was substantially outweighed by its prejudicial\n\neffects.    See Fed. R. Evid. 403.            We have stated that \"[o]nly\n\nrarely -- and in extraordinarily compelling circumstances -- will\n\n\n\n6\n  As the government notes, O'Shea's brief basically concedes this\npoint. In arguing that the evidence was unduly prejudicial, O'Shea\nstates that \"it requires much less a stretch of one's imagine [sic]\nto deduce the unproven suggestions that Kelley's accomplice was a\nparticipant in the armed robbery, and being aware of the gun\nattempted to dispose of the same.\"\n\n                                      -20-\n\fwe, from the vista of a cold appellate record, reverse a district\n\ncourt's on-the-spot judgment concerning the relative weighing of\n\nprobative value and unfair effect.\"          Flemmi, 402 F.3d 79, 86\n\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).           O'Shea's case\n\ndoes not present such an extraordinarily compelling circumstance.\n\n           We acknowledge that the evidence of the robbery was\n\ncertainly prejudicial to O'Shea.     However, that is not enough.        We\n\nhave stated that \"[v]irtually all evidence is prejudicial -- if the\n\ntruth be told, that is almost always why the proponent seeks to\n\nintroduce it -- but it is only unfair prejudice against which the\n\nlaw protects.\"    United States v. Pinillos-Prieto, 419 F.3d 61, 72\n\n(1st Cir. 2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)\n\n(emphasis in original).     We do not think that any unfair prejudice\n\noccurred here, especially given the district court's instructions\n\nto the jury.     As we noted above, the district court expressly\n\ninstructed the jury that O'Shea was not being charged with the\n\nrobbery and that the only way the jury could convict him was to\n\nfind beyond a reasonable doubt that he possessed a firearm.             We\n\nbelieve   that   these   instructions    limited   the   risk   of   unfair\n\nprejudice to O'Shea.     See United States v. Taylor, 284 F.3d 95, 104\n\n(1st Cir. 2002). We therefore affirm the district court's decision\n\nto admit evidence of the robbery.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -21-\n\fD.   Prosecutor's Closing Remarks\n\n           O'Shea's   final   argument   is   that   the   district   court\n\ncommitted plain error7 in not striking portions of the prosecutor's\n\nclosing remark because they focused on matters not in evidence that\n\nlikely affected the trial's outcome.      Specifically, O'Shea argues\n\nthat the prosecutor improperly focused on O'Shea's involvement with\n\nKelley in the robbery of Woods. O'Shea points to twelve statements\n\nby the prosecutor which linked O'Shea to Kelley and the robbery of\n\nWoods.   According to O'Shea, \"there is absolutely no evidence of\n\nhis [O'Shea's] involvement in the robbery.\"          We disagree.\n\n           While \"[i]t is well settled that in its closing argument\n\nthe prosecution may not rely on knowledge or evidence unavailable\n\nto the jury . . . the prosecutor may attempt to persuade the jury\n\nto draw inferences from the evidence.\" United States v. Hamie, 165\n\nF.3d 80, 84 (1st Cir. 1999) (internal citation omitted).               The\n\ninstant case presents an example of the latter situation.             While\n\nthere was no direct evidence linking O'Shea to the robbery, there\n\nwas ample circumstantial evidence, including the testimony of\n\nWoods, the police officers, and Washburn, from which the jury could\n\nhave inferred that O'Shea was present at the robbery.8                  The\n\n\n\n\n7\n   O'Shea did not object to the statements at trial, which is why\nhe now argues for plain error.\n8\n   We have already recounted this evidence in our discussion of\nO'Shea's sufficiency of the evidence challenge.\n\n                                  -22-\n\fgovernment was entitled to attempt to persuade the jury to draw\n\ncertain inferences from that evidence.\n\n          O'Shea also argues that \"[g]iven the lack of evidence\n\nlinking O'Shea to the gun near the rotary, it is likely that the\n\njury convicted for possession at the hotel rather than possession\n\nduring the chase.\" However, this argument is muted by the district\n\ncourt's   instruction      that   \"Mr.    O'Shea      is   not   charged      with\n\nparticipating in a robbery . . . And you're not being asked did he\n\nparticipate in a robbery or was he present for the robbery?                You're\n\nbeing asked whether the government has proved beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt that he possessed the firearm described in the indictment.\"\n\n          In   sum,   we    do    not    find   any    plain     error   in   the\n\nprosecutor's   closing     remarks.       We    therefore      reject    O'Shea's\n\narguments on this issue.\n\n                             III.   Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we affirm O'Shea's conviction.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -23-\n\f",

Woods got into his car and made a call on his cellular phone. As he made the call, a black sport utility vehicle (\"SUV\") pulled up behind his car and blocked him in. A white male approximately twenty-eight to thirty-one years old, with a shamrock tattoo on the right side of his neck, and wearing a black nylon jacket, a dark cap, and blue jeans got out of the driver's seat. The man approached the driver's side of Woods car, pointed a shiny silver revolver at Woods's head through the open window and demanded \"the hotel receipts.\" The man also demanded that Woods open his trunk, and Woods complied. While the man was searching the trunk, Woods observed a passenger in the SUV. The man took around $100 from Woods, got back into the SUV, and drove away with the passenger.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woods, who had written down the SUV's license plate number, immediately reported the robbery to the police, who radioed the information to other officers. Less than one minute after receiving the transmission, Boston police officers Richard Rackauskas (\"Rackauskas\") and Edward Norton (\"Norton\") spotted the SUV on Dorchester Avenue as they were traveling to the crime scene. They followed the SUV and turned on their lights and sirens. The SUV did not stop, and it eventually reached the intersection of Buttonwood Street and Columbia Road, where it entered Columbia Road going the wrong direction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The police officers followed but stayed on the proper side of the road. The SUV was closest to Rackauskas, who was driving the patrol car. The officers' car was approximately four car lengths behind the SUV.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Columbia Road goes underneath Interstate 93 (\"I-93\") and leads to a rotary. Just before the SUV reached the I-93 overpass, Rackauskas observed the SUV's passenger stick his arm out the window. The passenger's arm had gray clothing on it. Rackauskas saw a \"silver metallic shiny object\" in the passenger's hand and observed the passenger waving his arm back and forth. He told Norton that \"he's throwing something, there's something hanging out the window, he's got something out the window.\" Rackauskas only saw the object for a few seconds, did not see anything come out of the passenger's hand, and could not identify what the object was. Norton testified that he never saw an object and did not recall Rackauskas saying anything about such an object.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The officers lost sight of the SUV for about fifteen seconds as it traveled underneath the overpass and entered the rotary going clockwise, <i>i.e.,</i> in the wrong direction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> However, they saw it emerging from the rotary onto Old Colony Avenue and continued their pursuit. The occupants of the SUV abandoned the vehicle outside the Maryellan McCormack housing projects and ran in front of the patrol car &#8212; which was between fifty to one hundred yards away &#8212; into the housing development. Rackauskas identified the occupants as two white males: one wearing a black jacket, black hat, blue jeans, and sneakers; the other wearing a blue and grey sweatshirt, blue jeans, and sneakers. The men ran into an apartment building at 433 Old Colony Avenue. Rackauskas and Norton, joined by another policeman, Officer Daniel Ryan (\"Ryan\"), saw the suspects enter the apartment building. All three officers initially entered the building, but Rackauskas quickly exited to cover the windows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two suspects entered the second floor apartment of Ernest Washburn (\"Washburn\"), who was home at the time. As Norton and Ryan banged on the door, one of the suspects begged Washburn not to open the door. Washburn opened the door, however, and the suspects jumped out of a window into the courtyard below. In the meantime, Rackauskas had gone around to the back of the building where the courtyard was located. He saw O'Shea, who was dressed in a blue and grey sweatshirt, jeans, and sneakers, limping. Rackauskas ordered O'Shea to stop. O'Shea initially did not obey but eventually surrendered. Soon afterwards, the officers found the other suspect, Kevin Kelley (\"Kelley\"), in a nearby apartment building. Kelley was wearing a black jacket, had a tattoo on his neck, and was also limping.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the dispatch had reported that a silver handgun was used in the robbery, the police searched Kelley and O'Shea, the Maryellan McCormick housing project, and the SUV for the weapon. They did not find a firearm, but found an empty holster in plain view sitting by the center console between the two front seats. Rackauskas directed another policeman, Officer Robert Lucas (\"Lucas\"), to search the area around I-93 leading to the rotary. Officer Lucas searched the interior island of the rotary and found a silver handgun laying on the ground with nothing on top of it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 26, 2003, a grand jury issued a superseding indictment charging O'Shea with being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g). To convict under &#167; 922(g), a jury must to find that a defendant (1) has previously been convicted of a crime punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year, and (2) has knowingly possessed a firearm, (3) that was in or affected interstate commerce. <i>See United States v. Carpenter,</i> 403 F.3d 9, 10 (1st Cir.2005). The parties stipulated that O'Shea was a felon and that the gun found at the rotary had traveled in interstate commerce. The only issue at trial therefore was whether O'Shea had knowingly possessed the firearm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a four-day trial in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, a jury convicted O'Shea. On January 16, 2004, the district court sentenced O'Shea to 180 months imprisonment. O'Shea appealed on January 27, 2004.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Discussion</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the close of evidence, O'Shea filed a motion for judgment of acquittal pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(a), arguing that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he had knowingly and intentionally possessed the firearm. The district court denied the motion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> After the jury verdict, O'Shea again filed a Rule 29 motion, which the district court denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review <i>de novo</i> the denial of a Rule 29 motion for acquittal. <i>United States v. Mercado Irizarry,</i> 404 F.3d 497, 503 (1st Cir.2005). \"In doing so we must decide, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict of guilt, whether a reasonable factfinder could find the defendant guilty of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>Id.</i> This standard of review is \"formidable,\" <i>United States v. Loder,</i> 23 F.3d 586, 589 (1st Cir.1994), and \"[d]efendants challenging convictions for insufficiency of evidence face an uphill battle on appeal.\" <i>United States v. Hern&#225;ndez,</i> 218 F.3d 58, 64 (1st Cir.2000). In our review of Rule 29 determinations, \"`no premium is placed upon direct as opposed to circumstantial evidence; both types of proof can adequately ground a conviction.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>United States v. Ortiz,</i> 966 F.2d 707, 711 (1st Cir.1992)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">O'Shea argues that the district court erred in denying his Rule 29 motions because there is no evidence, direct or circumstantial, to support his conviction. He asserts that, although he was observed in the passenger seat of the SUV, there was no evidence linking him to the initial robbery at the Best Western, he was never seen with the gun in his hand, and the silver object seen by Rackauskas could have been anything, something Rackauskas admitted on cross-examination. O'Shea also notes that the gun was located \"a good distance\" from where Rackauskas observed the shiny metal object in the SUV passenger's hand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that there was ample evidence for the jury to conclude that O'Shea was with Kelley when Kelley robbed Woods and that O'Shea threw the silver firearm used in the robbery out the SUV's window as the police chased him and Kelley. We agree that the government has proven its case. There was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that O'Shea possessed the firearm in the SUV.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence supports the conclusion that O'Shea was the passenger in the SUV when Kelley robbed Woods with a silver handgun. Woods testified that he saw a passenger in the SUV as he was being robbed and that he called the police as soon as the SUV drove off. The report was immediately sent to officers over the radio, and Rackauskas and Norton spotted the SUV less than one minute after receiving the dispatch. It was reasonable for the jury to conclude that the passenger in the SUV when Woods was robbed was the same passenger in the SUV when the officers spotted the vehicle minutes later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, it was also reasonable for the jury to conclude that this was the same passenger whom Rackauskas saw wave his arm out the window while holding a shiny metallic object, and the same passenger the officers saw exit the SUV and run into the housing project. And it was reasonable for the jury to conclude that O'Shea, who was apprehended beneath the window the two suspects had jumped out of, was limping, and was wearing the same clothes as the man whom the officers observed running from the SUV, was this same passenger.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, it was also reasonable for the jury to conclude that the gun found on the rotary island was the same gun used during the robbery. The parties do not dispute that a shiny silver revolver was used during the robbery, or that the gun found at the rotary was a shiny silver revolver. After their apprehension, a silver revolver was not found on either of the suspects, in the housing project, or in the SUV, even though an empty holster was found in the SUV. In light of these facts, it was reasonable for the jury to conclude that the suspects rid themselves of the firearm sometime between the robbery and when they exited the SUV outside of the housing project. This would leave two possibilities: (1) that the suspects disposed of the firearm after the robbery but before they were spotted by the police &#8212; a dubious conclusion since the suspects would have had no motive to dispose of the firearm at that time; or (2) that the suspects disposed of the firearm after they were spotted, but did so when the officers were unable to see them. Under this latter possibility, the jury could have reasonably concluded that the suspects disposed of the firearm either somewhere in the housing projects or during the period when the officers lost sight of the SUV once it entered the I-93 underpass. However, a search of the housing project turned up nothing, while a search of the area where the suspects were when the police briefly lost sight of them revealed a shiny silver revolver. This revolver was found on the rotary island in the middle of the day, uncovered by any trash or debris; in short, it did not appear to have been sitting there for a long period of time. The jury could have reasonably concluded that this was the same revolver used during the robbery earlier that day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury also must have concluded that O'Shea possessed this revolver. We believe it could reasonably have done so. First, Rackauskas testified that he saw the passenger's arm out the window holding a shiny silver object. O'Shea points out that Norton testified that he never saw the passenger throw an object from the car, never saw the SUV's window go up or down, and never saw a shiny silver object, even though he was the passenger and could pay more attention to the SUV than Rackauskas, who was driving. However, Norton testified that he was handling the radio and watching cars in front of the patrol car and therefore did not have his eyes on the SUV the entire time. Further, Rackauskas testified that he saw the metallic object for only a couple of seconds. The jury could easily have inferred that Norton simply was not looking in the few seconds that Rackauskas observed the metallic object.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">O'Shea also makes much of the fact that Rackauskas saw the object before the SUV went beneath the overpass, while the revolver was found on the other side of the overpass on the rotary island. However, as Rackauskas testified, the time from when the officers lost sight of the SUV to the time they saw it again exiting the rotary spanned only fifteen seconds. Further, it makes sense that O'Shea would have disposed of the firearm at a time when the police could not see the SUV. It also makes sense that he would have disposed of the gun on the rotary island, hoping the grass would hide the gun, rather than simply tossing it into the street. Finally, the fact that the SUV entered the rotary going clockwise means that the rotary grass was on the passenger side of the SUV and therefore nearest O'Shea. The jury could have reasonably concluded that, in the fifteen-second window during which the police were out of sight, O'Shea tossed the gun into the rotary grass that was right next to his side of the car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">O'Shea also points out that Rackauskas admitted that the silver object could have been anything, including a cell phone found after the suspects' arrest. He states that it is \"most compelling\" that during deliberations the jury sent a note asking the judge where the cell phone was found. However, as the government notes, the cell phone was dark grey and plastic, not shiny and silver. Further, the fact that the jury sent the note but still convicted O'Shea simply indicates that the jury was doing its job. It considered O'Shea's theory that the object could have been a cell phone but rejected it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">O'Shea devotes considerable attention to our decision in <i>United States v. Luciano-Mosquera,</i> 63 F.3d 1142 (1st Cir.1995). However, we do not believe that case is helpful to O'Shea. <i>Luciano-Mosquera</i> involved several defendants engaged in a drug smuggling operation. The police conducted a sting operation and two of the defendants, Luciano-Mosquera and Pava-Buelba, were found under a jeep that had a M-16 concealed in the chassis. Another defendant, Lugo-Maya, was captured on a yawl as he headed out to sea. The yawl was found to have 50 rounds of ammunition. All of the appellants were convicted of possessing firearms during or in relation to a drug trafficking crime. We reversed the convictions of Pava-Buelba and Lugo-Maya, finding that there was no evidence either of them had possessed the gun. The facts of the instant case are quite different, however. As we have already discussed, it was reasonable for the jury to conclude that O'Shea was the passenger in the SUV during the robbery, that the gun found at the rotary was the gun used during the robbery, that the gun found at the rotary was the shiny silver object Rackauskas saw in O'Shea's hand just before the SUV went under I-93, and that O'Shea threw the gun into the rotary grass in the roughly fifteen-second window in which the police lost sight of the SUV. We therefore affirm the district court's denial of O'Shea's Rule 29 motions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The District Court's Reasonable Doubt Instruction</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">O'Shea next challenges the district court's jury instructions on reasonable doubt. Because he did not object to the instructions during his trial, we review for plain error. <i>See, United States v. Rodr&#237;guez-Marrero,</i> 390 F.3d 1, 25 (1st Cir.2004). Under plain error review, O'Shea must show that (1) there was an error (2) that was clear or obvious, (3) affected his substantial rights, and (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <i>See United States v. Medina-Mart&#237;nez,</i> 396 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we have warned against attempts to define \"reasonable doubt,\" noting that \"most efforts at clarification result in further obfuscation of the concept[,] . . . a district court does not necessarily commit reversible error by attempting to define the concept of reasonable doubt for the jury.\" <i>United States v. And&#250;jar,</i> 49 F.3d 16, 23 (1st Cir.1995) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Instead, reasonable doubt instructions constitute reversible error \"when, taken as a whole, they have a `reasonable likelihood' of misleading the jury to believe that it can convict on some lesser standard of proof than that required under the reasonable doubt standard.\" <i>United States v. Romero,</i> 32 F.3d 641, 651 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, the jury instructions at issue read as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, I've told you that the burden of proof is on the government to prove the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>The burden of proof has nothing to do with who called the witnesses or offered documents into evidence. It goes to the quality of the evidence.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And now I'm going to explain to you in more detail this concept of reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is a strict and heavy burden, but it does not mean that a defendant's guilt must be proved beyond all possible doubt. It does require that the evidence exclude any reasonable doubt concerning a defendant's guilt. <i>A reasonable doubt may arise not only from the evidence produced, but also from the lack of evidence.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reasonable doubt exists when after weighing and considering all of the evidence, using reason, common sense, jurors cannot say that they have a settled conviction of the truth of the charge. Of course, a defendant is never to be convicted on suspicion or conjecture. <i>If, for example, you view the evidence in the case as reasonably permitting either of two conclusions, one, that the defendant is guilty as charged, and the other that the defendant is not guilty, you will find the defendant not guilty.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added). O'Shea takes issue with the three emphasized portions of the instructions, arguing that they likely misled the jury as to the proper standard of proof.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the first portion, we find no error, and certainly no error that was clear or obvious. O'Shea argues that the instruction regarding \"the quality of evidence\" put on onus on the defendant to present evidence. We disagree. If anything, the jury would have interpreted the instruction as having the <i>opposite</i> effect. First, the sentence that the burden \"has nothing to do with who called witnesses or offered documents in evidence\" indicates that the jury should not consider who put on evidence, but only the evidence itself, meaning that it should not consider the fact that O'Shea did not introduce any evidence. Further, considering other portions of the instruction, there was no likelihood that the jury misunderstood the government's burden. <i>See United States v. Ranney,</i> 298 F.3d 74, 80 (1st Cir.2002) (stating that, even if a district court gave an improper jury instruction, \"we will affirm if in the light of the entire jury charge there was no `reasonable likelihood' that the jury misunderstood the government's burden\"). Elsewhere, the district court stated that O'Shea had no obligation to \"prove his innocence,\" and also specifically stated that O'Shea was not required \"to produce any evidence at all.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">O'Shea's next argument is that the sentence \"[a] reasonable doubt may arise . . . from the lack of evidence\" indicated to the jury that it could consider the fact that O'Shea did not present any evidence when considering reasonable doubt. We disagree, essentially for the same reasons as above. If anything, the jury would likely have interpreted that instruction as meaning that a reasonable doubt could arise from evidence the <i>government</i> did not present.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> It would make no sense if the instruction meant that a reasonable doubt as to O'Shea's guilt could arise as a result of O'Shea's lack of evidence. In any event, the district court made it clear elsewhere in the instructions that O'Shea did not have to prove anything and did not have to put on any evidence. We therefore find no plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, O'Shea argues that the district court's \"two conclusions\" instruction comparing guilt and non-guilt lowered the government's burden of proof to a civil preponderance of the evidence standard. <i>See And&#250;jar,</i> 49 F.3d at 24 (stating that \"due to the risks of misleading the jury, district courts should refrain wherever possible from using a `guilt or innocence' comparison in their jury instructions\"). The district court in the instant case referred to guilt or non-guilt, not guilt or innocence. As we noted in <i>Ranney,</i> where a court refers \"to guilt and <i>non-guilt,</i> rather than innocence, a term less susceptible to the lay response, we find the instruction less troublesome.\" 298 F.3d at 79. \"Nevertheless, telling jurors that the question is one of guilt or non-guilt, without more, could risk undercutting the government's burden by suggesting that the defendant is guilty if they do not think he is not guilty.\" <i>Id.</i> at 79-80.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Ranney</i> involved a jury instruction very similar to the one at issue here. <i>Id.</i> at 79. There, the district court \"repeated its instruction that the government was required to prove guilt `beyond a reasonable doubt' on some twenty-three occasions.\" <i>Id.</i> at 80. We affirmed because, taking the jury instructions as a whole, there was no reasonable likelihood that the jury failed to understand the government's burden of proof. <i>Id.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> In the instant case, the district court stated that the government was required to prove O'Shea's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt at least nineteen times. Further, the district court gave a careful and cogent discussion of the presumption of innocence, made it clear that O'Shea did not have to prove anything or present any evidence, and stated on at least three occasions that the jury could not consider the fact that O'Shea did not testify. <i>See And&#250;jar,</i> 49 F.3d at 24. The district court also stated that \"[i]t is not sufficient for the government to establish a probability, although a strong one, that a fact charged is more likely than not. That is not enough to meet the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\" This statement decreased the likelihood that the jury would have mistakenly believed that the government's burden of proof was a civil preponderance standard. Taken as a whole, the jury instructions leave no reasonable likelihood that the jury misunderstood the government's burden. We find no plain error in the district court's instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Evidence of the Robbery</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">O'Shea's third argument is that the district court erred when it admitted evidence of the robbery because it was not relevant and was unduly prejudicial. The government counters that the district court properly admitted the evidence because the evidence was highly relevant and its probative value substantially outweighed any prejudice to O'Shea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to trial, O'Shea filed a motion <i>in limine</i> to exclude any evidence pertaining to the robbery of Woods. In the motion, O'Shea argued that evidence of the robbery was not relevant under Fed.R.Evid. 401 and that, even if relevant, the evidence's probative value was substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect under Fed.R.Evid. 403. In denying the motion, the district court stated that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I find that, generally, the armed robbery is relevant to proving that there was a gun in the SUV, creates an opportunity for Mr. O'Shea to possess that gun actually or constructively. It's also relevant to the credibility of the police officers' testimony regarding seeing a silver object held outside the passenger side of the vehicle and the government's claim that the gun found on the roadway was previously in the SUV.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I don't think that the 911 call alone would be sufficient because . . . the testimony that Kelley was the driver in a circumstance where it is now alleged there were two people in the car &#8212; as I recall, the 911 call didn't discuss a second person &#8212; is relevant to prove that if Kelley was the driver, O'Shea was the passenger, and if Rackauskas is to be believed and something silver was held out the window and the jury concludes that silver thing was the gun that was later found, it provides relevant and potentially important evidence that Mr. O'Shea was the passenger and the person who held the gun out the window and, therefore, possessed it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also gave a limiting instruction to the jury making it clear that the jury could not convict O'Shea solely because they believed that he was present at the robbery: \"Mr. O'Shea is not charged with participating in a robbery. . . And you're not being asked did he participate in a robbery or was he present for the robbery? You're being asked whether the government has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he possessed the firearm described in the indictment.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's decision to admit evidence for abuse of discretion. <i>See United States v. Flemmi,</i> 402 F.3d 79, 86 (1st Cir.2005). The district court in this case did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of the robbery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">O'Shea's first argument is that evidence of the robbery was in no way relevant to the issue of whether he possessed a firearm. We disagree. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, \"`[r]elevant evidence' means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\" Fed.R.Evid. 401. As the district court noted, evidence of the robbery was relevant to proving that there was a gun in the SUV and created an opportunity for O'Shea to actually possess the gun. It was also relevant to the government's claim that the gun found on the rotary was in the SUV. Further, the evidence of the robbery was relevant to Rackauskas's credibility regarding his testimony that he saw a silver object held outside the passenger side of the SUV. In other words, evidence of the robbery makes it more likely than not that O'Shea was the passenger in the SUV, had the opportunity to possess the gun, and had the motive and opportunity to throw the gun from the SUV onto the rotary.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> We therefore agree with the district court that evidence of the robbery was relevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">O'Shea's second argument is that the admitted evidence's probative value was substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effects. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 403. We have stated that \"[o]nly rarely &#8212; and in extraordinarily compelling circumstances &#8212; will we, from the vista of a cold appellate record, reverse a district court's on-the-spot judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.\" <i>Flemmi,</i> 402 F.3d 79, 86 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). O'Shea's case does not present such an extraordinarily compelling circumstance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We acknowledge that the evidence of the robbery was certainly prejudicial to O'Shea. However, that is not enough. We have stated that \"[v]irtually all evidence is prejudicial &#8212; if the truth be told, that is almost always why the proponent seeks to introduce it &#8212; but it is only <i>unfair</i> prejudice against which the law protects.\" <i>United States v. Pinillos-Prieto,</i> 419 F.3d 61, 72 (1st Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (emphasis in original). We do not think that any unfair prejudice occurred here, especially given the district court's instructions to the jury. As we noted above, the district court expressly instructed the jury that O'Shea was not being charged with the robbery and that the only way the jury could convict him was to find beyond a reasonable doubt that he possessed a firearm. We believe that these instructions limited the risk of unfair prejudice to O'Shea. <i>See United States v. Taylor,</i> 284 F.3d 95, 104 (1st Cir.2002). We therefore affirm the district court's decision to admit evidence of the robbery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Prosecutor's Closing Remarks</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">O'Shea's final argument is that the district court committed plain error<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> in not striking portions of the prosecutor's closing remark because they focused on matters not in evidence that likely affected the trial's outcome. Specifically, O'Shea argues that the prosecutor improperly focused on O'Shea's involvement with Kelley in the robbery of Woods. O'Shea points to twelve statements by the prosecutor which linked O'Shea to Kelley and the robbery of Woods. According to O'Shea, \"there is absolutely no evidence of his [O'Shea's] involvement in the robbery.\" We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While \"[i]t is well settled that in its closing argument the prosecution may not rely on knowledge or evidence unavailable to the jury . . . the prosecutor may attempt to persuade the jury to draw inferences from the evidence.\" <i>United States v. Hamie,</i> 165 F.3d 80, 84 (1st Cir.1999) (internal citation omitted). The instant case presents an example of the latter situation. While there was no direct evidence linking O'Shea to the robbery, there was ample circumstantial evidence, including the testimony of Woods, the police officers, and Washburn, from which the jury could have inferred that O'Shea was present at the robbery.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> The government was entitled to attempt to persuade the jury to draw certain inferences from that evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">O'Shea also argues that \"[g]iven the lack of evidence linking O'Shea to the gun near the rotary, it is likely that the jury convicted for possession at the hotel rather than possession during the chase.\" However, this argument is muted by the district court's instruction that \"Mr. O'Shea is not charged with participating in a robbery . . .

Woods got into his car and made a call on his cellular phone. As he made the call, a black sport utility vehicle (\"SUV\") pulled up behind his car and blocked him in. A white male approximately twenty-eight to thirty-one years old, with a shamrock tattoo on the right side of his neck, and wearing a black nylon jacket, a dark cap, and blue jeans got out of the driver's seat. The man approached the driver's side of Woods car, pointed a shiny silver revolver at Woods's head through the open window and demanded \"the hotel receipts.\" The man also demanded that Woods open his trunk, and Woods complied. While the man was searching the trunk, Woods observed a passenger in the SUV. The man took around $100 from Woods, got back into the SUV, and drove away with the passenger.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woods, who had written down the SUV's license plate number, immediately reported the robbery to the police, who radioed the information to other officers. Less than one minute after receiving the transmission, Boston police officers Richard Rackauskas (\"Rackauskas\") and Edward Norton (\"Norton\") spotted the SUV on Dorchester Avenue as they were traveling to the crime scene. They followed the SUV and turned on their lights and sirens. The SUV did not stop, and it eventually reached the intersection of Buttonwood Street and Columbia Road, where it entered Columbia Road going the wrong direction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The police officers followed but stayed on the proper side of the road. The SUV was closest to Rackauskas, who was driving the patrol car. The officers' car was approximately four car lengths behind the SUV.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Columbia Road goes underneath Interstate 93 (\"I-93\") and leads to a rotary. Just before the SUV reached the I-93 overpass, Rackauskas observed the SUV's passenger stick his arm out the window. The passenger's arm had gray clothing on it. Rackauskas saw a \"silver metallic shiny object\" in the passenger's hand and observed the passenger waving his arm back and forth. He told Norton that \"he's throwing something, there's something hanging out the window, he's got something out the window.\" Rackauskas only saw the object for a few seconds, did not see anything come out of the passenger's hand, and could not identify what the object was. Norton testified that he never saw an object and did not recall Rackauskas saying anything about such an object.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The officers lost sight of the SUV for about fifteen seconds as it traveled underneath the overpass and entered the rotary going clockwise, <i>i.e.,</i> in the wrong direction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> However, they saw it emerging from the rotary onto Old Colony Avenue and continued their pursuit. The occupants of the SUV abandoned the vehicle outside the Maryellan McCormack housing projects and ran in front of the patrol car &#8212; which was between fifty to one hundred yards away &#8212; into the housing development. Rackauskas identified the occupants as two white males: one wearing a black jacket, black hat, blue jeans, and sneakers; the other wearing a blue and grey sweatshirt, blue jeans, and sneakers. The men ran into an apartment building at 433 Old Colony Avenue. Rackauskas and Norton, joined by another policeman, Officer Daniel Ryan (\"Ryan\"), saw the suspects enter the apartment building. All three officers initially entered the building, but Rackauskas quickly exited to cover the windows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two suspects entered the second floor apartment of Ernest Washburn (\"Washburn\"), who was home at the time. As Norton and Ryan banged on the door, one of the suspects begged Washburn not to open the door. Washburn opened the door, however, and the suspects jumped out of a window into the courtyard below. In the meantime, Rackauskas had gone around to the back of the building where the courtyard was located. He saw O'Shea, who was dressed in a blue and grey sweatshirt, jeans, and sneakers, limping. Rackauskas ordered O'Shea to stop. O'Shea initially did not obey but eventually surrendered. Soon afterwards, the officers found the other suspect, Kevin Kelley (\"Kelley\"), in a nearby apartment building. Kelley was wearing a black jacket, had a tattoo on his neck, and was also limping.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the dispatch had reported that a silver handgun was used in the robbery, the police searched Kelley and O'Shea, the Maryellan McCormick housing project, and the SUV for the weapon. They did not find a firearm, but found an empty holster in plain view sitting by the center console between the two front seats. Rackauskas directed another policeman, Officer Robert Lucas (\"Lucas\"), to search the area around I-93 leading to the rotary. Officer Lucas searched the interior island of the rotary and found a silver handgun laying on the ground with nothing on top of it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 26, 2003, a grand jury issued a superseding indictment charging O'Shea with being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g). To convict under &#167; 922(g), a jury must to find that a defendant (1) has previously been convicted of a crime punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year, and (2) has knowingly possessed a firearm, (3) that was in or affected interstate commerce. <i>See United States v. Carpenter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201505\"><a href=\"/opinion/201505/united-states-v-carpenter/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir.2005). The parties stipulated that O'Shea was a felon and that the gun found at the rotary had traveled in interstate commerce. The only issue at trial therefore was whether O'Shea had knowingly possessed the firearm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a four-day trial in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, a jury convicted O'Shea.

He asserts that, although he was observed in the passenger seat of the SUV, there was no evidence linking him to the initial robbery at the Best Western, he was never seen with the gun in his hand, and the silver object seen by Rackauskas could have been anything, something Rackauskas admitted on cross-examination. O'Shea also notes that the gun was located \"a good distance\" from where Rackauskas observed the shiny metal object in the SUV passenger's hand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that there was ample evidence for the jury to conclude that O'Shea was with Kelley when Kelley robbed Woods and that O'Shea threw the silver firearm used in the robbery out the SUV's window as the police chased him and Kelley. We agree that the government has proven its case. There was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that O'Shea possessed the firearm in the SUV.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence supports the conclusion that O'Shea was the passenger in the SUV when Kelley robbed Woods with a silver handgun. Woods testified that he saw a passenger in the SUV as he was being robbed and that he called the police as soon as the SUV drove off. The report was immediately sent to officers over the radio, and Rackauskas and Norton spotted the SUV less than one minute after receiving the dispatch. It was reasonable for the jury to conclude that the passenger in the SUV when Woods was robbed was the same passenger in the SUV when the officers spotted the vehicle minutes later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, it was also reasonable for the jury to conclude that this was the same passenger whom Rackauskas saw wave his arm out the window while holding a shiny metallic object, and the same passenger the officers saw exit the SUV and run into the housing project. And it was reasonable for the jury to conclude that O'Shea, who was apprehended beneath the window the two suspects had jumped out of, was limping, and was wearing the same clothes as the man whom the officers observed running from the SUV, was this same passenger.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, it was also reasonable for the jury to conclude that the gun found on the rotary island was the same gun used during the robbery. The parties do not dispute that a shiny silver revolver was used during the robbery, or that the gun found at the rotary was a shiny silver revolver. After their apprehension, a silver revolver was not found on either of the suspects, in the housing project, or in the SUV, even though an empty holster was found in the SUV. In light of these facts, it was reasonable for the jury to conclude that the suspects rid themselves of the firearm sometime between the robbery and when they exited the SUV outside of the housing project. This would leave two possibilities: (1) that the suspects disposed of the firearm after the robbery but before they were spotted by the police &#8212; a dubious conclusion since the suspects would have had no motive to dispose of the firearm at that time; or (2) that the suspects disposed of the firearm after they were spotted, but did so when the officers were unable to see them. Under this latter possibility, the jury could have reasonably concluded that the suspects disposed of the firearm either somewhere in the housing projects or during the period when the officers lost sight of the SUV once it entered the I-93 underpass. However, a search of the housing project turned up nothing, while a search of the area where the suspects were when the police briefly lost sight of them revealed a shiny silver revolver. This revolver was found on the rotary island in the middle of the day, uncovered by any trash or debris; in short, it did not appear to have been sitting there for a long period of time. The jury could have reasonably concluded that this was the same revolver used during the robbery earlier that day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury also must have concluded that O'Shea possessed this revolver. We believe it could reasonably have done so. First, Rackauskas testified that he saw the passenger's arm out the window holding a shiny silver object. O'Shea points out that Norton testified that he never saw the passenger throw an object from the car, never saw the SUV's window go up or down, and never saw a shiny silver object, even though he was the passenger and could pay more attention to the SUV than Rackauskas, who was driving. However, Norton testified that he was handling the radio and watching cars in front of the patrol car and therefore did not have his eyes on the SUV the entire time. Further, Rackauskas testified that he saw the metallic object for only a couple of seconds. The jury could easily have inferred that Norton simply was not looking in the few seconds that Rackauskas observed the metallic object.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">O'Shea also makes much of the fact that Rackauskas saw the object before the SUV went beneath the overpass, while the revolver was found on the other side of the overpass on the rotary island. However, as Rackauskas testified, the time from when the officers lost sight of the SUV to the time they saw it again exiting the rotary spanned only fifteen seconds. Further, it makes sense that O'Shea would have disposed of the firearm at a time when the police could not see the SUV. It also makes sense that he would have disposed of the gun on the rotary island, hoping the grass would hide the gun, rather than simply tossing it into the street. Finally, the fact that the SUV entered the rotary going clockwise means that the rotary grass was on the passenger side of the SUV and therefore nearest O'Shea. The jury could have reasonably concluded that, in the fifteen-second window during which the police were out of sight, O'Shea tossed the gun into the rotary grass that was right next to his side of the car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">O'Shea also points out that Rackauskas admitted that the silver object could have been anything, including a cell phone found after the suspects' arrest. He states that it is \"most compelling\" that during deliberations the jury sent a note asking the judge where the cell phone was found. However, as the government notes, the cell phone was dark grey and plastic, not shiny and silver. Further, the fact that the jury sent the note but still convicted O'Shea simply indicates that the jury was doing its job. It considered O'Shea's theory that the object could have been a cell phone but rejected it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">O'Shea devotes considerable attention to our decision in <i>United States v. Luciano-Mosquera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196263\"><a href=\"/opinion/196263/united-states-v-luciano-mosquera/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1142</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1995). However, we do not believe that case is helpful to O'Shea. <i>Luciano-Mosquera</i> involved several defendants engaged in a drug smuggling operation. The police conducted a sting operation and two of the defendants, Luciano-Mosquera and Pava-Buelba, were found under a jeep that had a M-16 concealed in the chassis. Another defendant, Lugo-Maya, was captured on a yawl as he headed out to sea. The yawl was found to have 50 rounds of ammunition. All of the appellants were convicted of possessing firearms during or in relation to a drug trafficking crime. We reversed the convictions of Pava-Buelba and Lugo-Maya, finding that there was no evidence either of them had possessed the gun. The facts of the instant case are quite different, however. As we have already discussed, it was reasonable for the jury to conclude that O'Shea was the passenger in the SUV during the robbery, that the gun found at the rotary was the gun used during the robbery, that the gun found at the rotary was the shiny silver object Rackauskas saw in O'Shea's hand just before the SUV went under I-93, and that O'Shea threw the gun into the rotary grass in the roughly fifteen-second window in which the police lost sight of the SUV. We therefore affirm the district court's denial of O'Shea's Rule 29 motions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B.

Under plain error review, O'Shea must show that (1) there was an error (2) that was clear or obvious, (3) affected his substantial rights, and (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <i>See United States v.

It goes to the quality of the evidence.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And now I'm going to explain to you in more detail this concept of reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is a strict and heavy burden, but it does not mean that a defendant's guilt must be proved beyond all possible doubt. It does require that the evidence exclude any reasonable doubt concerning a defendant's guilt. <i>A reasonable doubt may arise not only from the evidence produced, but also from the lack of evidence.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reasonable doubt exists when after weighing and considering all of the evidence, using reason, common sense, jurors cannot say that they have a settled conviction of the truth of the charge. Of course, a defendant is never to be convicted on suspicion or conjecture. <i>If, for example, you view the evidence in the case as reasonably permitting either of two conclusions, one, that the defendant is guilty as charged, and the other that the defendant is not guilty, you will find the defendant not guilty.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added). O'Shea takes issue with the three emphasized portions of the instructions, arguing that they likely misled the jury as to the proper standard of proof.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the first portion, we find no error, and certainly no error that was clear or obvious. O'Shea argues that the instruction regarding \"the quality of evidence\" put on onus on the defendant to present evidence. We disagree. If anything, the jury would have interpreted the instruction as having the <i>opposite</i> effect. First, the sentence that the burden \"has nothing to do with who called witnesses or offered documents in evidence\" indicates that the jury should not consider who put on evidence, but only the evidence itself, meaning that it should not consider the fact that O'Shea did not introduce any evidence. Further, considering other portions of the instruction, there was no likelihood that the jury misunderstood the government's burden. <i>See United States v. Ranney,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200051\"><a href=\"/opinion/200051/united-states-v-ranney/\"><span class=\"volume\">298</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span>, 80 (1st Cir.2002) (stating that, even if a district court gave an improper jury instruction, \"we will affirm if in the light of the entire jury charge there was no `reasonable likelihood' that the jury misunderstood the government's burden\"). Elsewhere, the district court stated that O'Shea had no obligation to \"prove his innocence,\" and also specifically stated that O'Shea was not required \"to produce any evidence at all.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">O'Shea's next argument is that the sentence \"[a] reasonable doubt may arise . . . from the lack of evidence\" indicated to the jury that it could consider the fact that O'Shea did not present any evidence when considering reasonable doubt. We disagree, essentially for the same reasons as above. If anything, the jury would likely have interpreted that instruction as meaning that a reasonable doubt could arise from evidence the <i>government</i> did not present.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> It would make no sense if the instruction meant that a reasonable doubt as to O'Shea's guilt could arise as a result of O'Shea's lack of evidence. In any event, the district court made it clear elsewhere in the instructions that O'Shea did not have to prove anything and did not have to put on any evidence. We therefore find no plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, O'Shea argues that the district court's \"two conclusions\" instruction comparing guilt and non-guilt lowered the government's burden of proof to a civil preponderance of the evidence standard. <i>See And&#250;jar,</i> 49 F.3d at 24 (stating that \"due to the risks of misleading the jury, district courts should refrain wherever possible from using a `guilt or innocence' comparison in their jury instructions\"). The district court in the instant case referred to guilt or non-guilt, not guilt or innocence. As we noted in <i>Ranney,</i> where a court refers \"to guilt and <i>non-guilt,</i> rather than innocence, a term less susceptible to the lay response, we find the instruction less troublesome.\" 298 F.3d at 79. \"Nevertheless, telling jurors that the question is one of guilt or non-guilt, without more, could risk undercutting the government's burden by suggesting that the defendant is guilty if they do not think he is not guilty.\" <i>Id.</i> at 79-80.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Ranney</i> involved a jury instruction very similar to the one at issue here. <i>Id.</i> at 79. There, the district court \"repeated its instruction that the government was required to prove guilt `beyond a reasonable doubt' on some twenty-three occasions.\" <i>Id.</i> at 80. We affirmed because, taking the jury instructions as a whole, there was no reasonable likelihood that the jury failed to understand the government's burden of proof. <i>Id.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> In the instant case, the district court stated that the government was required to prove O'Shea's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt at least nineteen times. Further, the district court gave a careful and cogent discussion of the presumption of innocence, made it clear that O'Shea did not have to prove anything or present any evidence, and stated on at least three occasions that the jury could not consider the fact that O'Shea did not testify. <i>See And&#250;jar,</i> 49 F.3d at 24. The district court also stated that \"[i]t is not sufficient for the government to establish a probability, although a strong one, that a fact charged is more likely than not. That is not enough to meet the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\" This statement decreased the likelihood that the jury would have mistakenly believed that the government's burden of proof was a civil preponderance standard. Taken as a whole, the jury instructions leave no reasonable likelihood that the jury misunderstood the government's burden. We find no plain error in the district court's instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Evidence of the Robbery</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">O'Shea's third argument is that the district court erred when it admitted evidence of the robbery because it was not relevant and was unduly prejudicial. The government counters that the district court properly admitted the evidence because the evidence was highly relevant and its probative value substantially outweighed any prejudice to O'Shea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to trial, O'Shea filed a motion <i>in limine</i> to exclude any evidence pertaining to the robbery of Woods. In the motion, O'Shea argued that evidence of the robbery was not relevant under Fed.R.Evid. 401 and that, even if relevant, the evidence's probative value was substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect under Fed.R.Evid. 403. In denying the motion, the district court stated that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I find that, generally, the armed robbery is relevant to proving that there was a gun in the SUV, creates an opportunity for Mr. O'Shea to possess that gun actually or constructively. It's also relevant to the credibility of the police officers' testimony regarding seeing a silver object held outside the passenger side of the vehicle and the government's claim that the gun found on the roadway was previously in the SUV.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I don't think that the 911 call alone would be sufficient because . . . the testimony that Kelley was the driver in a circumstance where it is now alleged there were two people in the car &#8212; as I recall, the 911 call didn't discuss a second person &#8212; is relevant to prove that if Kelley was the driver, O'Shea was the passenger, and if Rackauskas is to be believed and something silver was held out the window and the jury concludes that silver thing was the gun that was later found, it provides relevant and potentially important evidence that Mr. O'Shea was the passenger and the person who held the gun out the window and, therefore, possessed it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also gave a limiting instruction to the jury making it clear that the jury could not convict O'Shea solely because they believed that he was present at the robbery: \"Mr. O'Shea is not charged with participating in a robbery. . . And you're not being asked did he participate in a robbery or was he present for the robbery? You're being asked whether the government has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he possessed the firearm described in the indictment.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's decision to admit evidence for abuse of discretion. <i>See United States v. Flemmi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201500\"><a href=\"/opinion/201500/united-states-v-flemmi/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span>, 86 (1st Cir.2005). The district court in this case did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of the robbery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">O'Shea's first argument is that evidence of the robbery was in no way relevant to the issue of whether he possessed a firearm. We disagree. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, \"`[r]elevant evidence' means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\" Fed.R.Evid. 401. As the district court noted, evidence of the robbery was relevant to proving that there was a gun in the SUV and created an opportunity for O'Shea to actually possess the gun. It was also relevant to the government's claim that the gun found on the rotary was in the SUV. Further, the evidence of the robbery was relevant to Rackauskas's credibility regarding his testimony that he saw a silver object held outside the passenger side of the SUV. In other words, evidence of the robbery makes it more likely than not that O'Shea was the passenger in the SUV, had the opportunity to possess the gun, and had the motive and opportunity to throw the gun from the SUV onto the rotary.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> We therefore agree with the district court that evidence of the robbery was relevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">O'Shea's second argument is that the admitted evidence's probative value was substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effects. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 403. We have stated that \"[o]nly rarely &#8212; and in extraordinarily compelling circumstances &#8212; will we, from the vista of a cold appellate record, reverse a district court's on-the-spot judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.\" <i>Flemmi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201500\"><a href=\"/opinion/201500/united-states-v-flemmi/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span>, 86 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). O'Shea's case does not present such an extraordinarily compelling circumstance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We acknowledge that the evidence of the robbery was certainly prejudicial to O'Shea. However, that is not enough. We have stated that \"[v]irtually all evidence is prejudicial &#8212; if the truth be told, that is almost always why the proponent seeks to introduce it &#8212; but it is only <i>unfair</i> prejudice against which the law protects.\" <i>United States v. Pinillos-Prieto,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201767\"><a href=\"/opinion/201767/united-states-v-pinillos/\"><span class=\"volume\">419</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">61</span></a></span>, 72 (1st Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (emphasis in original). We do not think that any unfair prejudice occurred here, especially given the district court's instructions to the jury. As we noted above, the district court expressly instructed the jury that O'Shea was not being charged with the robbery and that the only way the jury could convict him was to find beyond a reasonable doubt that he possessed a firearm. We believe that these instructions limited the risk of unfair prejudice to O'Shea. <i>See United States v. Taylor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199888\"><a href=\"/opinion/199888/united-states-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">95</span></a></span>, 104 (1st Cir.2002). We therefore affirm the district court's decision to admit evidence of the robbery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Prosecutor's Closing Remarks</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">O'Shea's final argument is that the district court committed plain error<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> in not striking portions of the prosecutor's closing remark because they focused on matters not in evidence that likely affected the trial's outcome. Specifically, O'Shea argues that the prosecutor improperly focused on O'Shea's involvement with Kelley in the robbery of Woods. O'Shea points to twelve statements by the prosecutor which linked O'Shea to Kelley and the robbery of Woods. According to O'Shea, \"there is absolutely no evidence of his [O'Shea's] involvement in the robbery.\" We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While \"[i]t is well settled that in its closing argument the prosecution may not rely on knowledge or evidence unavailable to the jury . . . the prosecutor may attempt to persuade the jury to draw inferences from the evidence.\" <i>United States v. Hamie,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198286\"><a href=\"/opinion/198286/united-states-v-hamie/\"><span class=\"volume\">165</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span>, 84 (1st Cir.1999) (internal citation omitted). The instant case presents an example of the latter situation. While there was no direct evidence linking O'Shea to the robbery, there was ample circumstantial evidence, including the testimony of Woods, the police officers, and Washburn, from which the jury could have inferred that O'Shea was present at the robbery.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> The government was entitled to attempt to persuade the jury to draw certain inferences from that evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">O'Shea also argues that \"[g]iven the lack of evidence linking O'Shea to the gun near the rotary, it is likely that the jury convicted for possession at the hotel rather than possession during the chase.\" However, this argument is muted by the district court's instruction that \"Mr. O'Shea is not charged with participating in a robbery . . . And you're not being asked did he participate in a robbery or was he present for the robbery? You're being asked whether the government has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he possessed the firearm described in the indictment.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we do not find any plain error in the prosecutor's closing remarks. We therefore reject O'Shea's arguments on this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm O'Shea's conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Columbia Road is a six-lane road with three lanes going in each direction, separated by a median</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Since the SUV entered the rotary going clockwise, the passenger side was closest to the rotary's interior, which is where the gun at issue was eventually found</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The district court did rule that the evidence was insufficient to find that O'Shea constructively possessed the firearm during the robbery, which was one of the government's theories of the case.
