B.J. Almeida appeals the district\n\ncourt’s denial of his motion to suppress evidence introduced at\n\ntrial that led to his conviction for possession with the intent to\n\ndistribute five or more grams of cocaine base.                See 21 U.S.C. §§\n\n841(a)(1) &    841(b)(1)(B).     We affirm.\n\n                                        I.\n\n           Police officers in Lewiston, Maine, placed a residence on\n\nVail Street under surveillance after receiving information from\n\nreliable sources that drugs, including cocaine base, were being\n\ndistributed from an apartment at this address.                While conducting\n\nthe surveillance, Officer Gregory Boucher began to follow an\n\nautomobile after he observed it pick up a passenger, noted by\n\nBoucher   to   be   a   black   male,    outside   of   the    building.    He\n\nimmediately called another officer, Eric Syphers for assistance.\n\nAfter Officers Syphers and Boucher observed the car run a stop\n\nsign, Syphers used his marked police car to pull it over into a\n\nparking lot.        Officer Wayne Clifford arrived seconds later.\n\n           Officers Syphers and Clifford approached the car and\n\nspoke with the driver, a white male, who identified himself as\n\nAndrew Ash.    Another white male sitting in the front identified\n\nhimself as Vernon Milliken, and a black male sitting in the back\n\nand on the right identified himself as B.J. Almeida.\n\n           Ash got out of the car and told Officer Syphers that\n\nAlmeida had asked to be dropped off on Vail Street and then picked\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fup after calling Ash on his cellular telephone. This narrative was\n\nconsistent with Officer Boucher’s earlier observations.                  Officer\n\nClifford received Ash’s permission to conduct a pat-down search and\n\ndiscovered $1,000 in cash.             This discovery raised Clifford's\n\nsuspicion that the occupants of the car were parties to a drug\n\ndeal.   Ash told Officer Clifford that he had nothing to hide and\n\nthat the officers were free to search his car.               They did so and\n\nrecovered a crack pipe, which later tested positive for cocaine\n\nresidue, under the right front seat. Clifford also found marijuana\n\nin the car’s center console.\n\n            The officers separated the suspects.            Officers Clifford\n\nand Boucher spoke to Milliken, who said that he and Ash had picked\n\nup Almeida in Gray, Maine, driven him to Lewiston and then dropped\n\nhim   off   so   he   could   “score   some   crack”   at   the   Vail   Street\n\napartment.       Officer Clifford then turned to Almeida, identified\n\nhimself as a police officer, and advised Almeida that officers had\n\nobserved him purchasing or selling illegal drugs.             Almeida denied\n\nthe accusation and consented to a pat-down search, which yielded\n\n$851 in cash in a pocket of his pants. Meanwhile, Milliken told\n\nOfficer Boucher that Almeida was concealing cocaine base between\n\nhis legs.    Officer Boucher approached Almeida, advised him that he\n\nknew that he had drugs in between his legs, and suggested that he\n\n“do the right thing” and surrender it.           Almeida stated, “Yeah, I\n\ngot something.”        Boucher observed him reach into his pants and\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fremove a clear plastic bag that contained 11.2 grams of cocaine\n\nbase. A federal grand jury subsequently indicted the three men for\n\ntrafficking in crack cocaine.\n\n            Almeida moved to suppress the statement he made admitting\n\npossession of drugs and his act of producing the cocaine base.           He\n\nargued that his words and conduct were custodial \"statements\"\n\nobtained in violation of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).\n\nAt an evidentiary hearing before a magistrate judge, the government\n\nstipulated that Almeida was “in custody” for purposes of Miranda\n\nwhen Officer Boucher asked him to surrender the hidden crack, and\n\nthat   it   would   not   offer   Almeida’s   statement,   “Yeah,   I   got\n\nsomething,” in its case-in-chief. But the government also took the\n\nposition that the manner in which it recovered the crack, and the\n\ncrack itself, were admissible.       One of the government's arguments\n\nwas that, even if Almeida had not turned the crack over to Officer\n\nBoucher, inevitably the contraband would have been discovered. The\n\ngovernment argued that probable cause to arrest Almeida existed\n\nafter Officers Boucher and Clifford found the crack pipe and\n\nmarijuana in the car, that the officers in fact would have arrested\n\nAlmeida, and that, after the arrest, Almeida would have been strip-\n\nsearched, and the drugs discovered, at the local jail.                  The\n\nmagistrate judge agreed and recommended that the district court\n\ndeny Almeida’s suppression motion under the inevitable discovery\n\ndoctrine.     After the district court accepted the magistrate’s\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\frecommendation,   Almeida   entered    a   conditional   guilty   plea,\n\nreserving an appeal of the suppression ruling.\n\n                                 II.\n\n          In assessing the denial of the suppression motion, we\n\nreview the district court's factual findings for clear error and\n\nits legal conclusions de novo.   See United States v. Maguire, 359\n\nF.3d 71, 76 (1st Cir. 2004).      As it did below, the government\n\nargues for the inevitable discovery exception to the exclusionary\n\nconsequences of a Miranda violation.       Almeida responds that the\n\ndrugs were obtained in violation of Miranda, but has not, in his\n\nbrief, challenged the asserted inevitable discovery basis for\n\nadmitting the evidence.      He has therefore waived his right to\n\nchallenge the government's inevitable discovery assertion.         But,\n\neven apart from the waiver, if we consider the inevitable discovery\n\nissue on the merits, we nevertheless believe that the district\n\ncourt correctly applied the inevitable discovery exception in these\n\ncircumstances.1\n\n          The purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter law\n\nenforcement officers from violating a defendant’s rights.          See\n\nUnited States v. Capozzi, 347 F.3d 327, 332 (1st Cir. 2003).       The\n\ninevitable discovery exception recognizes that, if the evidence\n\nwould have been discovered lawfully, “the deterrence rationale has\n\n\n\n     1\n       We take no position on whether there was a Miranda violation\nin this case.\n\n                                 -5-\n\fso little basis that the evidence should be received.”             Nix v.\n\nWilliams, 467 U.S. 431, 444 (1984).      The burden of proving that the\n\nexception applies rests with the government.         Id.\n\n            In evaluating inevitable discovery claims, we ask three\n\nquestions: first, whether the legal means by which the evidence\n\nwould have been discovered was truly independent; second, whether\n\nthe use of the legal means would have inevitably led to the\n\ndiscovery   of   the   evidence;   and   third,   whether    applying   the\n\ninevitable discovery rule would either provide an incentive for\n\npolice   misconduct      or   significantly       weaken    constitutional\n\nprotections.     See United States v. Pardue, 385 F.3d 101, 106 (1st\n\nCir. 2004).\n\n            We begin by considering whether Almeida's arrest, which\n\nthe government says would have set in motion the chain of events\n\nleading to the discovery of the crack, was truly independent of any\n\ninterrogation that caused Almeida to turn over the drugs.                An\n\narrest is considered to be independent if (1) the police, in fact,\n\nwould have arrested the defendant, even without first having\n\ndiscovered the challenged evidence, and (2) in the absence of the\n\nchallenged evidence, the officers nevertheless had probable cause\n\nto make the arrest without the challenged evidence.            See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Glenn, 152 F.3d 1047, 1049-1050 (8th Cir. 1998);\n\nUnited States v. Jones, 72 F.3d 1324, 1331-1333 (7th Cir. 1995);\n\nUnited States v. Moore, 37 Fed. Appx. 963, 967 (10th Cir. 2002);\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fUnited States v. White, No. 95-5752, 1997 WL 159540, at *4 (4th\n\nCir. Apr. 7, 1997) (unpublished disposition).         Both conditions are\n\nmet here.\n\n            The   district   court   credited    Officers   Boucher's   and\n\nClifford’s testimony that they would have arrested Almeida after\n\ndiscovering the crack pipe, and we see no basis in the record for\n\nupsetting that determination.        Discovery of the pipe, made as a\n\nresult of Ash’s consent to search the car, preceded (and thus was\n\nindependent of) Officer Boucher's request that Almeida turn over\n\nthe drugs.\n\n            So too probable cause existed for the arrest; at the time\n\nof arrest, “the facts and circumstances within [the officers’]\n\nknowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information\n\nwere sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that the\n\npetitioner had committed or was committing an offense.\"           Beck v.\n\nOhio, 379 U.S. 89, 91 (1964).          Under federal law, a person is\n\nguilty of a crime if he or she actively or constructively possesses\n\neven a small quantity of crack cocaine.         21 U.S.C. § 844(a); United\n\nStates v. Jeffers, 524 F.2d 253, 257 (7th Cir. 1975) (conviction\n\nunder 21 U.S.C. § 844(a) requires only a “trace” of a controlled\n\nsubstance).\n\n            Here, the officers retrieved a crack pipe from beneath\n\nthe seat directly in front of Almeida. The officers had previously\n\nwitnessed Almeida enter and exit an apartment that they had been\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\freliably told was a place where crack was being dealt.            Moreover,\n\nMilliken informed the officers that they had picked up Almeida for\n\nthe express purpose of “scoring some crack,” a substantial amount\n\nof cash was found on Almeida, and neither Ash nor Milliken admitted\n\nto   possession   of    the   pipe.    This   evidence,   taken   together,\n\nestablished probable cause for the officers to arrest Almeida prior\n\nto his having handed over the crack cocaine.\n\n            Turning to the question of whether the arrest inevitably\n\nwould have led to the discovery of the concealed drugs, the\n\ngovernment must demonstrate, to a high degree of probability, that\n\nthe evidence would have been discovered.              See United States v.\n\nRogers, 102 F.3d 641, 646 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n            Officers Boucher and Clifford testified that they would\n\nhave transported Almeida to the Androscoggin County Jail after they\n\narrested him, that the jail routinely strip-searched incoming\n\ndetainees as part of its intake processing, and that the drugs\n\nwould have been discovered at that time.        Based on this testimony,\n\nthe district court found that the drugs would have been discovered\n\nas a part of the routine search that would have followed Almeida’s\n\narrest.     This finding is supported by the record and thus is not\n\nclearly erroneous.      See Maguire, 359 F.3d at 76.\n\n            Finally, we consider whether applying the inevitable\n\ndiscovery    doctrine    in   these   circumstances    would   substantially\n\nweaken Miranda protections or encourage police misconduct.              See\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fPardue, 385 F.3d at 106.            This inquiry is case specific and\n\nrequires an appreciation of the societal costs of the exclusionary\n\nrule.   See United States v. Scott, 270 F.3d 30, 45 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n           Here, the government proved to the district court’s\n\nsatisfaction    not   only   that   the     officers   could   have   arrested\n\nAlmeida, but also that the officers would have arrested Almeida,\n\neven had they not discovered the drugs he possessed.             Because, as\n\ndiscussed above, the officers would have eventually seized the\n\ndrugs by arresting Almeida (as they had planned to do before\n\nquestioning him), they had little incentive to try to obtain the\n\ncrack through unconstitutional means when a lawful means was\n\nreadily available.      See id. (concluding that this aspect of the\n\ninevitable discovery exception test was met where applying the\n\nexception would \"not act as an incentive to unconstitutional\n\nbehavior\").     We therefore perceive no risk that applying the\n\ninevitable discovery exception in these circumstances will erode\n\nMiranda protections or encourage police misconduct.2\n\n                                     III.\n\n           For the reasons stated, we affirm Almeida's conviction\n\nand sentence.\n\n\n     2\n       Almeida also contests his sentence on the ground that the\ndistrict court declined to give him a downward departure because\nhis criminal history score was inflated.       The district court\ndeclined to grant the departure because it determined that, under\nthe facts of the case, a departure was not warranted. The district\ncourt's decision is thus not reviewable. See United States v.\nKornegay, 410 F.3d 89, 98 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                                     -9-\n\f",

At an evidentiary hearing before a magistrate judge, the government stipulated that Almeida was \"in custody\" for purposes of <i>Miranda</i> when Officer Boucher asked him to surrender the hidden crack, and that it would not offer Almeida's statement, \"Yeah, I got something,\" in its case-in-chief. But the government also took the position that the manner in which it recovered the crack, and the crack itself, were admissible. One of the government's arguments was that, even if Almeida had not turned the crack over to Officer Boucher, inevitably the contraband would have been discovered. The government argued that probable cause to arrest Almeida existed after Officers Boucher and Clifford found the crack pipe and marijuana in the car, that the officers in fact would have arrested Almeida, and that, after the arrest, Almeida would have been strip-searched, and the drugs discovered, at the local jail.

Almeida responds that the drugs were obtained in violation of <i>Miranda,</i> but has not, in his brief, challenged the asserted inevitable discovery basis for admitting the evidence. He has therefore waived his right to challenge the government's inevitable discovery assertion. But, even apart from the waiver, if we consider the inevitable discovery issue on the merits, we nevertheless believe that the district court correctly applied the inevitable discovery exception in these circumstances.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter law enforcement officers from violating a defendant's rights. <i>See United States v.

Almeida appeals the district court's denial of his motion to suppress evidence introduced at trial that led to his conviction for possession with the intent to distribute five or more grams of cocaine base. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1) &amp; 841(b)(1)(B). We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Police officers in Lewiston, Maine, placed a residence on Vail Street under surveillance after receiving information from reliable sources that drugs, including cocaine base, were being distributed from an apartment at this address. While conducting the surveillance, Officer Gregory Boucher began to follow an automobile after he observed it pick up a passenger, noted by Boucher to be a black male, outside of the building. He immediately called another officer, Eric Syphers for assistance. After Officers Syphers and Boucher observed the car run a stop sign, Syphers used his marked police car to pull it over into a parking lot. Officer Wayne Clifford arrived seconds later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officers Syphers and Clifford approached the car and spoke with the driver, a white male, who identified himself as Andrew Ash. Another white male sitting in the front identified himself as Vernon Milliken, and a black male sitting in the back and on the right identified himself as B.J. Almeida.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ash got out of the car and told Officer Syphers that Almeida had asked to be dropped off on Vail Street and then picked up after calling Ash on his cellular telephone. This narrative was consistent with Officer Boucher's earlier observations. Officer Clifford received Ash's permission to conduct a pat-down search and discovered $1,000 in cash. This discovery raised Clifford's suspicion that the occupants of the car were parties to a drug deal. Ash told Officer Clifford that he had nothing to hide and that the officers were free to search his car. They did so and recovered a crack pipe, which later tested positive for cocaine residue, under the right front seat. Clifford also found marijuana in the car's center console.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The officers separated the suspects. Officers Clifford and Boucher spoke to Milliken, who said that he and Ash had picked up Almeida in Gray, Maine, driven him to Lewiston and then dropped him off so he could \"score some crack\" at the Vail Street apartment. Officer Clifford then turned to Almeida, identified himself as a police officer, and advised Almeida that officers had observed him purchasing or selling illegal drugs. Almeida denied the accusation and consented to a pat-down search, which yielded $851 in cash in a pocket of his pants. Meanwhile, Milliken told Officer Boucher that Almeida was concealing cocaine base between his legs. Officer Boucher approached Almeida, advised him that he knew that he had drugs in between his legs, and suggested that he \"do the right thing\" and surrender it. Almeida stated, \"Yeah, I got something.\" Boucher observed him reach into his pants and remove a clear plastic bag that contained 11.2 grams of cocaine base. A federal grand jury subsequently indicted the three men for trafficking in crack cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Almeida moved to suppress the statement he made admitting possession of drugs and his act of producing the cocaine base. He argued that his words and conduct were custodial \"statements\" obtained in violation of <i>Miranda v. Arizona,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">694</span></a></span> (1966). At an evidentiary hearing before a magistrate judge, the government stipulated that Almeida was \"in custody\" for purposes of <i>Miranda</i> when Officer Boucher asked him to surrender the hidden crack, and that it would not offer Almeida's statement, \"Yeah, I got something,\" in its case-in-chief. But the government also took the position that the manner in which it recovered the crack, and the crack itself, were admissible. One of the government's arguments was that, even if Almeida had not turned the crack over to Officer Boucher, inevitably the contraband would have been discovered. The government argued that probable cause to arrest Almeida existed after Officers Boucher and Clifford found the crack pipe and marijuana in the car, that the officers in fact would have arrested Almeida, and that, after the arrest, Almeida would have been strip-searched, and the drugs discovered, at the local jail. The magistrate judge agreed and recommended that the district court deny Almeida's suppression motion under the inevitable discovery doctrine. After the district court accepted the magistrate's recommendation, Almeida entered a conditional guilty plea, reserving an appeal of the suppression ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In assessing the denial of the suppression motion, we review the district court's factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. <i>See United States v. Maguire,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201013\"><a href=\"/opinion/201013/united-states-v-maguire/\"><span class=\"volume\">359</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span>, 76 (1st Cir.2004). As it did below, the government argues for the inevitable discovery exception to the exclusionary consequences of a <i>Miranda</i> violation. Almeida responds that the drugs were obtained in violation of <i>Miranda,</i> but has not, in his brief, challenged the asserted inevitable discovery basis for admitting the evidence. He has therefore waived his right to challenge the government's inevitable discovery assertion. But, even apart from the waiver, if we consider the inevitable discovery issue on the merits, we nevertheless believe that the district court correctly applied the inevitable discovery exception in these circumstances.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter law enforcement officers from violating a defendant's rights. <i>See United States v. Capozzi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200671\"><a href=\"/opinion/200671/united-states-v-capozzi/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">327</span></a></span>, 332 (1st Cir.2003). The inevitable discovery exception recognizes that, if the evidence would have been discovered lawfully, \"the deterrence rationale has so little basis that the evidence should be received.\" <i>Nix v. Williams,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111204\"><a href=\"/opinion/111204/nix-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">431</span></a></span>, 444, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111204\"><a href=\"/opinion/111204/nix-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">377</span></a></span> (1984). The burden of proving that the exception applies rests with the government. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In evaluating inevitable discovery claims, we ask three questions: first, whether the legal means by which the evidence would have been discovered was truly independent; second, whether the use of the legal means would have inevitably led to the discovery of the evidence; and third, whether applying the inevitable discovery rule would either provide an incentive for police misconduct or significantly weaken constitutional protections. <i>See United States v. Pardue,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201272\"><a href=\"/opinion/201272/united-states-v-pardue/\"><span class=\"volume\">385</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">101</span></a></span>, 106 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by considering whether Almeida's arrest, which the government says would have set in motion the chain of events leading to the discovery of the crack, was truly independent of any interrogation that caused Almeida to turn over the drugs. An arrest is considered to be independent if (1) the police, in fact, would have arrested the defendant, even without first having discovered the challenged evidence, and (2) in the absence of the challenged evidence, the officers nevertheless had probable cause to make the arrest without the challenged evidence. <i>See, e.g., United States v.
