George Z. Singal, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                       Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                 Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Alvin Scott Corey on brief pro se.\n     F. Mark Terison, Senior Litigation Counsel and Paul D.\nSilsby, United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                            March 26, 2007\n\f            Per Curiam.       Petitioner, Alvin Scott Corey, appeals\n\nthe United States District Court for the District of Maine’s\n\ndismissal   of   his   habeas      corpus       petition,    which     he   filed\n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255.              We granted a certificate of\n\nappealability    on    the    issues      of    whether    (i)   his   sentence\n\nviolated the rule announced in Shepard v. United States, 125 S.\n\nCt. 1254 (2005), and (ii) the admission of expert testimony\n\nconcerning the manufacture of the weapon for which he was\n\nconvicted    violated        the   rule        announced    in   Crawford     v.\n\nWashington, 124 S. Ct. 1354 (2004).                   We held the case in\n\nabeyance while we awaited the Supreme Court’s decision in\n\nWhorton v. Bockting, 2007 U.S. LEXIS 2826 (Feb. 28, 2007), and\n\nthe path is now clear to proceed forward.\n\n            As the issues before us are purely legal, we review\n\nthem de novo.    Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255, petitioner had one\n\nyear within which to file his habeas petition.                   The district\n\ncourt dismissed it as time-barred, so the first order of\n\nbusiness is to determine the appropriate triggering date for\n\nthe one-year deadline.         Petitioner appears to argue that the\n\nclock should begin for his Shepard and Crawford claims on the\n\ndates upon which the Supreme Court issued those opinions.                     He\n\nunderstands, however, that the timing of his petition is such\n\nthat he must establish that the rules announced in those cases\n\nare newly recognized by the Supreme Court and are retroactively\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fapplicable to cases on collateral review.            See 28 U.S.C. §\n\n2255, ¶ 6(3).   Petitioner fails to clear this hurdle.\n\n          There is no dispute that the rules in Shepard and\n\nCrawford are newly recognized.      Nor is there any dispute that\n\nthose rules are procedural in nature.               Ordinarily, newly\n\nannounced rules of criminal procedure, about which the Supreme\n\nCourt has been silent as to retroactivity, are presumed to be\n\nnon-retroactive.    See Tyler v. Cain, 533 U.S. 656, 665 (2001)\n\n(interpreting Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288 (1989), as setting\n\ngeneral bar to retroactive application of newly announced rules\n\nof criminal procedure).    Petitioner argues that the exception\n\nto this general bar for \"watershed rules of criminal procedure\n\nimplicating   the   fundamental    fairness   and    accuracy   of   the\n\ncriminal proceeding\" applies here.      We disagree.\n\n          We first consider the Shepard claim.         Our opinion in\n\nCirilo-Munoz v. United States, 404 F.3d 527 (1st Cir. 2005),\n\nis instructive.     There, we held that the rule announced in\n\nUnited States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005), was not a\n\nwatershed rule.     See Cirilo-Munoz, 404 F.3d at 532-33.             In\n\ndoing so, we noted that judge-made findings at sentencing have\n\nbeen the conventional practice throughout our nation's history.\n\nSee id. We added that this retroactivity analysis resolves any\n\ncomparable \"Blakely-like\" claim in this circuit.          Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f           Our reasoning there applies with equal force here.\n\nShepard,   like    Booker,       set   forth      limitations   on    judicial\n\nfactfinding, but it did so to a far lesser degree, restricting\n\nonly the type of evidence that is appropriate for review in\n\nparticular circumstances.          See Shepard, 125 S.Ct. at 1263 (\"We\n\nhold that enquiry under the ACCA to determine whether a plea of\n\nguilty to burglary defined by a nongeneric statute necessarily\n\nadmitted elements of the generic offense is limited to the\n\nterms of the charging document, the terms of a plea agreement\n\nor transcript of colloquy between judge and defendant in which\n\nthe factual basis for the plea was confirmed by the defendant,\n\nor to some comparable judicial record of this information.\").\n\nAccordingly,      Shepard    presents        an    even    weaker    case    for\n\nretroactivity      than    did    Booker.          This   interpretation     is\n\nbolstered by the fact that each of the three courts of appeals\n\nthat has faced this issue has arrived at the same conclusion.\n\nSee United States v. Christensen, 456 F.3d 1205, 1208 (10th\n\nCir. 2006); United States v. Armstrong, 151 Fed. Appx. 155, 157\n\n(3d Cir. 2005); United States v. Davis, 133 Fed. Appx. 916 (4th\n\nCir. 2005).\n\n           Recent developments make the Crawford issue even\n\neasier to resolve. In Whorton, the Supreme Court held that the\n\nrule   announced    in    Crawford     is    not    a   watershed    rule   and,\n\n\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\ftherefore,     is   not    retroactively       applicable    to   cases    on\n\ncollateral review.        See 2007 U.S. LEXIS 2826 at *29.\n\n             Because   the    dates    upon    which   the   Supreme    Court\n\nannounced     the   rules     in     Shepard    and    Crawford   are     not\n\nappropriate    triggering      dates     for   section   2255's   one-year\n\nlimitations period in these circumstances, we are left with the\n\ndefault triggering date--the day that petitioner’s judgment of\n\nconviction became final.           Petitioner’s judgment of conviction\n\nbecame final in 2000, but he filed his petition several years\n\nlater.   Accordingly, it is untimely.\n\n             For these reasons, we summarily affirm the district\n\ncourt's dismissal of the petition on timeliness grounds.                  See\n\n1st Cir. R. 27.0(c).         AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f",
