Daniel McCarthy, a\nNewburyport, Massachusetts police officer, brought this action\nagainst the former and current chiefs of police, Thomas Cappelluzzo\nand Thomas H. Howard; fellow police officers Alan Maguire, David\nFoley and David Knight; former mayors of Newburyport Lisa Mead and\nAlan Lavender; and the City of Newburyport.                  McCarthy alleged\nclaims   under   42   U.S.C.    §   1983    for    violations   of   his   First\nAmendment, due process, and equal protection rights, as well as\nclaims under various state laws. The district court, in a thorough\nand well-reasoned memorandum and order, granted defendants’ motions\nfor summary judgment.     We affirm.\n\n\n                 I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n           McCarthy’s    lawsuit      stems       from   disciplinary   actions\nagainst him in the wake of controversy surrounding local newspaper\nreporting about the Newburyport Police Department (“NPD”).                   In\nMarch 2001, some NPD members came to believe that McCarthy was the\nsource of information used in local newspaper stories that were\ncritical of the department, based on McCarthy’s acquaintance with\na local member of the press.          This led to a letter to the city\ncouncil (signed by Officers David Foley and David Knight, among\nothers), a newspaper article that McCarthy claims alluded to him as\na disruptive presence in the NPD, and a letter from McCarthy to the\nnewspaper editor.\n           In April 2001, McCarthy made an arrest using a key to a\nprivate establishment.         An unknown person posted in the police\ndepartment a copy of the NPD policy forbidding officers from\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fpossessing keys to private establishments without permission from\nthe police chief, and Chief Thomas Cappelluzzo orally reprimanded\nMcCarthy for violating the policy. McCarthy then received repeated\nrequests for a written report on the incident from Sergeant Alan\nMaguire and Chief Cappelluzzo. In July 2001, after McCarthy failed\nto comply with the requests, Cappelluzzo suspended him for three\ndays. When Cappelluzzo ordered him to relinquish his gun and badge\nfor the duration of his suspension, McCarthy allegedly tossed his\nloaded gun onto Cappelluzzo’s desk.         McCarthy was then given an\nadditional five-day suspension.       An independent counsel reviewed\nand   upheld   these   suspensions,   and   recommended   an   additional\nfifteen-day suspension, which Lisa Mead, the mayor, ordered.\n            In February 2002, the Essex County District Attorney’s\nOffice filed a criminal assault complaint against McCarthy for\ntossing the gun onto Cappelluzzo’s desk.       The new chief of police,\nThomas H. Howard, placed McCarthy on administrative leave for the\nduration of the criminal case. In October 2002, the court directed\na verdict for McCarthy on the charge.\n            In September 2002, the new mayor, Alan Lavender, selected\nOfficer Maguire for promotion to sergeant.        Lavender passed over\nMcCarthy, who was the top-ranked candidate on the Civil Service\nList, in part because of the past disciplinary actions against\nMcCarthy and the then-pending criminal charge.       The Massachusetts\nState Human Resources Division subsequently affirmed Lavender’s\ndecision.\n            McCarthy filed this action in June 2003. In his 31-count\ncomplaint, he alleged that defendants violated his First Amendment\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\frights to freedom of speech and freedom of association, and his\nFourteenth Amendment due process and equal protection rights. He\nalso asserted various state law claims, including defamation,\ninvasion of privacy, malicious prosecution, abuse of process,\nintentional    infliction     of   emotional   distress,    negligence,   and\nviolation of his rights under the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act\n(“MCRA”).    The   district   court   granted     the   defendants’   summary\njudgment motions in February 2007.          This timely appeal followed.\n\n\n                          II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n            We review a summary judgment de novo, viewing the facts\nand reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the\nnonmovant plaintiff when determining whether the district court\ncorrectly applied the law in finding no genuine issues of material\nfact.     Nicolo v. Philip Morris, Inc., 201 F.3d 29, 33 (1st Cir.\n2000).     A “material” fact is a “contested fact [that] has the\npotential to change the outcome of the suit under the governing law\nif the dispute over it is resolved favorably to the nonmovant,” and\na “genuine issue” means that “the evidence about the fact is such\nthat a reasonable jury could resolve the point in favor of the\nnonmoving party.” Navarro v. Pfizer Corp., 261 F.3d 90, 93-94 (1st\nCir. 2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). If the\nmoving party has made a preliminary showing that there is no\ngenuine    issue   of   material    fact,   the   nonmovant   must    “produce\nspecific facts, in suitable evidentiary form, to . . . establish\nthe presence of a trialworthy issue.”             Triangle Trading Co. v.\nRobroy Indus., Inc., 200 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1999) (internal\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fquotation marks and citation omitted). If the nonmovant’s argument\n“rests merely upon conclusory allegations, improbable inferences,\nand unsupported speculation,” summary judgment is appropriate.\nMedina-Munoz v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 896 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir.\n1990).\n\n\n             III. CAPPELLUZZO’S SUMMARY JUDGMENT MOTION\n A.   First Amendment\n            A government employee alleging an adverse employment\naction in response to the exercise of First Amendment rights “must\nintroduce   sufficient    evidence     to     permit    a    finding    that   his\nparticipation in this protected activity was a substantial or\nmotivating factor behind the adverse employment action,”                 Perez v.\nPierluisi, 339 F.3d 43, 55 (1st Cir. 2003) (citing Mt. Healthy City\nSch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 287 (1977)).                   The\nburden of persuasion then shifts to the defendant to demonstrate by\na preponderance that the adverse employment action would have been\ntaken “even in the absence of the protected conduct.”                  Id. at 56\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).                 Summary judgment\non a First Amendment claim will be upheld “only if (1) the record\nevidence compelled the conclusion that the plaintiff would have\n[suffered    the   adverse   employment       action]       in   any   event   for\nnondiscriminatory reasons, or (2) the plaintiff did not introduce\nsufficient evidence in the first instance to shift the burden of\npersuasion to the defendants.”         Id. (internal quotation marks and\ncitation omitted).\n            McCarthy   argues   that    the    disciplinary        actions   taken\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fagainst him were motivated by his letter to the editor.                   There is\nno evidence to support this conclusory assertion.                As the district\ncourt pointed out, McCarthy’s letter to the editor actually praised\nCappelluzzo, and McCarthy’s testimony at his deposition was that\nCappelluzzo never took or threatened any action against him based\non his association with the reporter.                   Cappelluzzo had ample\nnondiscriminatory reason to discipline McCarthy, given McCarthy’s\nrepeated failure to comply with Cappelluzzo’s requests for a\nwritten    report.      We     agree    with   the   district    court     that   no\nreasonable juror could find that McCarthy’s protected speech was a\nmotivating factor for any alleged adverse employment action.\n\n\nB.   Equal Protection\n            McCarthy argues that he was denied equal protection\nbecause the facts asserted in support of his First Amendment claim\nraise an inference that he received unfavorable or malicious\ntreatment.    This    claim     fails    because     McCarthy    has   offered    no\nevidence that he was “intentionally treated differently from others\nsimilarly situated.”          Village of Willowbrook v. Olech, 528 U.S.\n562, 564 (2000) (per curiam).\n\n\nC.   Substantive Due Process\n            McCarthy argues that the facts alleged in his First\nAmendment     claim     establish       malicious       intent   or      deliberate\nindifference on the part of Cappelluzzo, in violation of McCarthy’s\nsubstantive due process rights. He contends that he suffered harm\nto   his   reputation    and    that    his    rights   under    state    law   were\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fadversely affected when he was passed over for a promotion, despite\nhis place at the top of the Civil Service List.                    This claim fails\nbecause McCarthy cannot demonstrate that he lost governmental\nbenefits    as     a   result     of   “government     action”     on   the    part    of\nCappelluzzo.       See Pendleton v. City of Haverhill, 156 F.3d 57, 63\n(1st Cir. 1998). The decision to bypass McCarthy for promotion was\nmade by Mayor Lavender and affirmed by the state Human Resources\nDivision.\n\n\nD.   State Law Claims\n            McCarthy        has    alleged   no   facts       in   support     of     his\nintentional infliction of emotional distress claim that would show\nthat Cappelluzzo’s conduct was “beyond all bounds of decency and .\n. . utterly intolerable in a civilized society,” Cady v. Marcella,\n729 N.E.2d 1125, 1131 (Mass. App. Ct. 2000) (internal quotation\nmarks and citation omitted).\n            Nor is there any evidence that Cappelluzzo violated the\nMCRA by interfering with McCarthy’s rights under the Massachusetts\nor federal constitution.           To prevail on an MCRA claim, a plaintiff\nmust demonstrate (1) an interference or attempted interference with\nthe exercise or enjoyment of rights secured by the Constitution,\nfederal     law,       or   Massachusetts       law,    (2)    through        “threats,\nintimidation, or coercion.”               Howcroft v. City of Peabody, 747\nN.E.2d 729, 745 (Mass. App. Ct. 2001) (internal quotation marks and\ncitation omitted).          McCarthy has alleged no facts that would allow\na reasonable jury find a violation.\n            The malicious prosecution and abuse of process claims\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\falso fail.   A malicious prosecution claim requires a showing that\ncriminal   proceedings   were    instituted    without   probable    cause,\nCorrellas v. Viveiros, 572 N.E.2d 7, 10 (Mass. 1991). McCarthy has\nnot alleged any facts that would support a finding that there was\nno probable cause behind Cappelluzzo’s referral of the incident to\nthe Essex County District Attorney’s Office.        The abuse of process\nclaim requires a showing of an “ulterior purpose” to the litigation\nin question, Silvia v. Bldg. Inspector of W. Bridgewater, 621\nN.E.2d 686, 687 (Mass. App. Ct. 451), and McCarthy has offered\nnothing beyond “conclusory allegations” to support his claim that\nCappelluzzo had such an ulterior purpose.\n\n\n         IV. REMAINING DEFENDANTS’ SUMMARY JUDGMENT MOTION\nA.   First Amendment\n           Because   Officers    Foley   and   Knight    took   no   adverse\nemployment action against McCarthy, they cannot be held liable for\nFirst Amendment retaliation.       With respect to Sergeant Maguire,\nMcCarthy   has   produced   no   evidence   that   Maguire’s    activities\namounted to an adverse employment action or were motivated by an\nintent to interfere with McCarthy’s First Amendment rights.              The\nclaim against Officer Howard also fails because McCarthy can point\nto no evidence that Officer Howard’s approval of the decision to\nplace McCarthy on administrative leave or to refer the gun-tossing\nincident to the district attorney’s office was motivated by any\nprotected speech.\n           Because McCarthy cannot prevail on his First Amendment\nclaims against Officers Foley, Knight, Howard and Sergeant Maguire,\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fMayors Mead and Lavender are also entitled to summary judgment on\nMcCarthy’s claim that they violated his First Amendment rights by\nnot taking action against the NPD officers who were supposedly\nretaliating against him.      McCarthy has also failed to demonstrate\nthat his letter to the editor was a “substantial or motivating\nfactor” behind the fifteen-day suspension imposed by Mead (which\nwas based on a recommendation by independent counsel), or behind\nLavender’s decision not to promote McCarthy.           Perez, 339 F.3d at\n55.\n             Finally, the City of Newburyport is entitled to summary\njudgment because, as the court below observed, McCarthy has not\nproduced the requisite evidence of a municipal custom or policy of\ndeliberate indifference to a constitutional violation.            Monell v.\nCity of New York Dept. of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658 (1978).\n\n\nB.    Equal Protection\n             The remaining defendants are also entitled to summary\njudgment on McCarthy’s equal protection claims for the same reason\nas Cappelluzzo.\n\n\nC.    Substantive Due Process\n             McCarthy argues that the remaining defendants’ actions\ntoward him reflected a malicious intent or deliberate indifference\nto his welfare, and thus violated his substantive due process\nrights.      The claim fails because McCarthy has offered no evidence\nthat   the    defendants’   actions    could   be   found   to   “shock   the\nconscience” or be considered “truly outrageous, uncivilized, and\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fintolerable.” Hasenfus v. LaJeunesse, 175 F.3d 68, 72 (1st Cir.\n1999) (citations omitted).\n\n\nD.   State Law Claims\n           McCarthy cannot prevail on his defamation claim against\nMaguire, Howard, Foley, and Knight because he has failed to allege\n(1) the basis of the libel or slander claim, along with the precise\nwording of at least one sentence of the statement at issue; (2) the\nmeans and approximate dates of publication; and (3) the falsity of\nthose statements.     Dorn v. Astra USA, 975 F.Supp. 388, 396 (D.\nMass. 1997).\n           The remaining individual defendants are also entitled to\nsummary   judgment   on   the   claim   for   intentional   infliction   of\nemotional distress because McCarthy has failed to allege any facts\nthat would show that the defendants’ conduct was “beyond all bounds\nof decency and . . . utterly intolerable in a civilized society,”\nCady, 729 N.E.2d at 1131.\n           McCarthy’s claim for negligence against the City of\nNewburyport fails because he did not comply with the Massachusetts\nTort Claims Act requirement to “first present his claim in writing\nto the executive officer of such public employer within two years\nafter the date upon which the cause of action arose.”          Mass. Gen.\nLaws ch 258, § 4; see Weaver v. Commonwealth, 438 N.E.2d 831, 834\n(Mass. 1982) (presentment must be made “in strict compliance with\nthe statute”).\n           The remaining defendants are entitled to summary judgment\non the MCRA claim. McCarthy alleges that Lavender threatened that\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fMcCarthy would never be promoted within the NPD if McCarthy did not\nsupport Lavender’s selection for the open sergeant position.   Even\nif this allegation were true, McCarthy has not demonstrated that\nLavender’s threat interfered with McCarthy’s rights under the\nConstitution, federal law, or Massachusetts law, as required.\nHowcroft, 747 N.E.2d at 745.\n\n\n                            V. CONCLUSION\n            For the foregoing reasons, the judgment is affirmed.\n\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\f",

Howard; fellow police officers Alan Maguire, David\nFoley and David Knight; former mayors of Newburyport Lisa Mead and\nAlan Lavender; and the City of Newburyport.

In October 2002, the court directed\na verdict for McCarthy on the charge.\n            In September 2002, the new mayor, Alan Lavender, selected\nOfficer Maguire for promotion to sergeant.        Lavender passed over\nMcCarthy, who was the top-ranked candidate on the Civil Service\nList, in part because of the past disciplinary actions against\nMcCarthy and the then-pending criminal charge.       The Massachusetts\nState Human Resources Division subsequently affirmed Lavender’s\ndecision.\n            McCarthy filed this action in June 2003. In his 31-count\ncomplaint, he alleged that defendants violated his First Amendment\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\frights to freedom of speech and freedom of association, and his\nFourteenth Amendment due process and equal protection rights. He\nalso asserted various state law claims, including defamation,\ninvasion of privacy, malicious prosecution, abuse of process,\nintentional    infliction     of   emotional   distress,    negligence,   and\nviolation of his rights under the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act\n(“MCRA”).    The   district   court   granted     the   defendants’   summary\njudgment motions in February 2007.          This timely appeal followed.\n\n\n                          II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n            We review a summary judgment de novo, viewing the facts\nand reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the\nnonmovant plaintiff when determining whether the district court\ncorrectly applied the law in finding no genuine issues of material\nfact.     Nicolo v. Philip Morris, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198766\"><a href=\"/opinion/198766/nicolo-v-philip-morris-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">201</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 33 (1st Cir.\n2000).     A “material” fact is a “contested fact [that] has the\npotential to change the outcome of the suit under the governing law\nif the dispute over it is resolved favorably to the nonmovant,” and\na “genuine issue” means that “the evidence about the fact is such\nthat a reasonable jury could resolve the point in favor of the\nnonmoving party.” Navarro v. Pfizer Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199563\"><a href=\"/opinion/199563/navarro-pomares-v-pfizer-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">261</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 93-94 (1st\nCir. 2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). If the\nmoving party has made a preliminary showing that there is no\ngenuine    issue   of   material    fact,   the   nonmovant   must    “produce\nspecific facts, in suitable evidentiary form, to . . . establish\nthe presence of a trialworthy issue.”             Triangle Trading Co. v.\nRobroy Indus., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198787\"><a href=\"/opinion/198787/triangle-trading-co-v-robroy-industries-i/\"><span class=\"volume\">200</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2 (1st Cir. 1999) (internal\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fquotation marks and citation omitted). If the nonmovant’s argument\n“rests merely upon conclusory allegations, improbable inferences,\nand unsupported speculation,” summary judgment is appropriate.\nMedina-Munoz v. R.J.

CAPPELLUZZO’S SUMMARY JUDGMENT MOTION\n A.   First Amendment\n            A government employee alleging an adverse employment\naction in response to the exercise of First Amendment rights “must\nintroduce   sufficient    evidence     to     permit    a    finding    that   his\nparticipation in this protected activity was a substantial or\nmotivating factor behind the adverse employment action,”                 Perez v.\nPierluisi, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200592\"><a href=\"/opinion/200592/guilloty-perez-v-fuentes-agostini/\"><span class=\"volume\">339</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 55 (1st Cir. 2003) (citing Mt. Healthy City\nSch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109574\"><a href=\"/opinion/109574/mt-healthy-city-bd-of-ed-v-doyle/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 287 (1977)).                   The\nburden of persuasion then shifts to the defendant to demonstrate by\na preponderance that the adverse employment action would have been\ntaken “even in the absence of the protected conduct.”                  Id. at 56\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).                 Summary judgment\non a First Amendment claim will be upheld “only if (1) the record\nevidence compelled the conclusion that the plaintiff would have\n[suffered    the   adverse   employment       action]       in   any   event   for\nnondiscriminatory reasons, or (2) the plaintiff did not introduce\nsufficient evidence in the first instance to shift the burden of\npersuasion to the defendants.”         Id. (internal quotation marks and\ncitation omitted).\n            McCarthy   argues   that    the    disciplinary        actions   taken\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fagainst him were motivated by his letter to the editor.                   There is\nno evidence to support this conclusory assertion.                As the district\ncourt pointed out, McCarthy’s letter to the editor actually praised\nCappelluzzo, and McCarthy’s testimony at his deposition was that\nCappelluzzo never took or threatened any action against him based\non his association with the reporter.                   Cappelluzzo had ample\nnondiscriminatory reason to discipline McCarthy, given McCarthy’s\nrepeated failure to comply with Cappelluzzo’s requests for a\nwritten    report.      We     agree    with   the   district    court     that   no\nreasonable juror could find that McCarthy’s protected speech was a\nmotivating factor for any alleged adverse employment action.\n\n\nB.   Equal Protection\n            McCarthy argues that he was denied equal protection\nbecause the facts asserted in support of his First Amendment claim\nraise an inference that he received unfavorable or malicious\ntreatment.    This    claim     fails    because     McCarthy    has   offered    no\nevidence that he was “intentionally treated differently from others\nsimilarly situated.”          Village of Willowbrook v. Olech, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1855348\"><a href=\"/opinion/1855348/village-of-willowbrook-v-olech/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">562</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 564 (2000) (per curiam).\n\n\nC.   Substantive Due Process\n            McCarthy argues that the facts alleged in his First\nAmendment     claim     establish       malicious       intent   or      deliberate\nindifference on the part of Cappelluzzo, in violation of McCarthy’s\nsubstantive due process rights. He contends that he suffered harm\nto   his   reputation    and    that    his    rights   under    state    law   were\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fadversely affected when he was passed over for a promotion, despite\nhis place at the top of the Civil Service List.                    This claim fails\nbecause McCarthy cannot demonstrate that he lost governmental\nbenefits    as     a   result     of   “government     action”     on   the    part    of\nCappelluzzo.       See Pendleton v. City of Haverhill, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198106\"><a href=\"/opinion/198106/pendleton-v-haverhill/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 63\n(1st Cir. 1998). The decision to bypass McCarthy for promotion was\nmade by Mayor Lavender and affirmed by the state Human Resources\nDivision.\n\n\nD.   State Law Claims\n            McCarthy        has    alleged   no   facts       in   support     of     his\nintentional infliction of emotional distress claim that would show\nthat Cappelluzzo’s conduct was “beyond all bounds of decency and .\n. . utterly intolerable in a civilized society,” Cady v. Marcella,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">729</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1125</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1131 (Mass. App. Ct. 2000) (internal quotation\nmarks and citation omitted).\n            Nor is there any evidence that Cappelluzzo violated the\nMCRA by interfering with McCarthy’s rights under the Massachusetts\nor federal constitution.           To prevail on an MCRA claim, a plaintiff\nmust demonstrate (1) an interference or attempted interference with\nthe exercise or enjoyment of rights secured by the Constitution,\nfederal     law,       or   Massachusetts       law,    (2)    through        “threats,\nintimidation, or coercion.”               Howcroft v. City of Peabody, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">747</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">729</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 745 (Mass. App. Ct. 2001) (internal quotation marks and\ncitation omitted).          McCarthy has alleged no facts that would allow\na reasonable jury find a violation.\n            The malicious prosecution and abuse of process claims\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\falso fail.   A malicious prosecution claim requires a showing that\ncriminal   proceedings   were    instituted    without   probable    cause,\nCorrellas v. Viveiros, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">572</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 10 (Mass. 1991). McCarthy has\nnot alleged any facts that would support a finding that there was\nno probable cause behind Cappelluzzo’s referral of the incident to\nthe Essex County District Attorney’s Office.        The abuse of process\nclaim requires a showing of an “ulterior purpose” to the litigation\nin question, Silvia v. Bldg. Inspector of W. Bridgewater, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2024447\"><a href=\"/opinion/2024447/silvia-v-bldg-inspector-of-west-bridgewater/\"><span class=\"volume\">621</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">686</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 687 (Mass. App. Ct. 451), and McCarthy has offered\nnothing beyond “conclusory allegations” to support his claim that\nCappelluzzo had such an ulterior purpose.\n\n\n         IV. REMAINING DEFENDANTS’ SUMMARY JUDGMENT MOTION\nA.   First Amendment\n           Because   Officers    Foley   and   Knight    took   no   adverse\nemployment action against McCarthy, they cannot be held liable for\nFirst Amendment retaliation.       With respect to Sergeant Maguire,\nMcCarthy   has   produced   no   evidence   that   Maguire’s    activities\namounted to an adverse employment action or were motivated by an\nintent to interfere with McCarthy’s First Amendment rights.              The\nclaim against Officer Howard also fails because McCarthy can point\nto no evidence that Officer Howard’s approval of the decision to\nplace McCarthy on administrative leave or to refer the gun-tossing\nincident to the district attorney’s office was motivated by any\nprotected speech.\n           Because McCarthy cannot prevail on his First Amendment\nclaims against Officers Foley, Knight, Howard and Sergeant Maguire,\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fMayors Mead and Lavender are also entitled to summary judgment on\nMcCarthy’s claim that they violated his First Amendment rights by\nnot taking action against the NPD officers who were supposedly\nretaliating against him.      McCarthy has also failed to demonstrate\nthat his letter to the editor was a “substantial or motivating\nfactor” behind the fifteen-day suspension imposed by Mead (which\nwas based on a recommendation by independent counsel), or behind\nLavender’s decision not to promote McCarthy.           Perez, 339 F.3d at\n55.\n             Finally, the City of Newburyport is entitled to summary\njudgment because, as the court below observed, McCarthy has not\nproduced the requisite evidence of a municipal custom or policy of\ndeliberate indifference to a constitutional violation.            Monell v.\nCity of New York Dept. of Soc. Servs., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109881\"><a href=\"/opinion/109881/monell-v-new-york-city-dept-of-social-servs/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">658</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1978).\n\n\nB.    Equal Protection\n             The remaining defendants are also entitled to summary\njudgment on McCarthy’s equal protection claims for the same reason\nas Cappelluzzo.\n\n\nC.    Substantive Due Process\n             McCarthy argues that the remaining defendants’ actions\ntoward him reflected a malicious intent or deliberate indifference\nto his welfare, and thus violated his substantive due process\nrights.      The claim fails because McCarthy has offered no evidence\nthat   the    defendants’   actions    could   be   found   to   “shock   the\nconscience” or be considered “truly outrageous, uncivilized, and\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fintolerable.” Hasenfus v. LaJeunesse, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198449\"><a href=\"/opinion/198449/hasenfus-v-lajeunesse/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 72 (1st Cir.\n1999) (citations omitted).\n\n\nD.   State Law Claims\n           McCarthy cannot prevail on his defamation claim against\nMaguire, Howard, Foley, and Knight because he has failed to allege\n(1) the basis of the libel or slander claim, along with the precise\nwording of at least one sentence of the statement at issue; (2) the\nmeans and approximate dates of publication; and (3) the falsity of\nthose statements.     Dorn v. Astra USA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1458922\"><a href=\"/opinion/1458922/dorn-v-astra-usa/\"><span class=\"volume\">975</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">388</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 396 (D.\nMass. 1997).\n           The remaining individual defendants are also entitled to\nsummary   judgment   on   the   claim   for   intentional   infliction   of\nemotional distress because McCarthy has failed to allege any facts\nthat would show that the defendants’ conduct was “beyond all bounds\nof decency and . . . utterly intolerable in a civilized society,”\nCady, 729 N.E.2d at 1131.\n           McCarthy’s claim for negligence against the City of\nNewburyport fails because he did not comply with the Massachusetts\nTort Claims Act requirement to “first present his claim in writing\nto the executive officer of such public employer within two years\nafter the date upon which the cause of action arose.”          Mass. Gen.\nLaws ch 258, § 4; see Weaver v. Commonwealth, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">831</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 834\n(Mass. 1982) (presentment must be made “in strict compliance with\nthe statute”).\n           The remaining defendants are entitled to summary judgment\non the MCRA claim. McCarthy alleges that Lavender threatened that\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fMcCarthy would never be promoted within the NPD if McCarthy did not\nsupport Lavender’s selection for the open sergeant position.   Even\nif this allegation were true, McCarthy has not demonstrated that\nLavender’s threat interfered with McCarthy’s rights under the\nConstitution, federal law, or Massachusetts law, as required.\nHowcroft, 747 N.E.2d at 745.\n\n\n                            V. CONCLUSION\n            For the foregoing reasons, the judgment is affirmed.\n\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\f</pre>",
