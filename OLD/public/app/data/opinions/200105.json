Robert E. Keeton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                        Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                 Selya and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Tony Johnson on brief pro se.\n     Tony Royall Smith, Christopher J. Campbell and Jackson, Lewis,\nSchnitzler & Krupman on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n                         August 23, 2002\n\f            Per Curiam. After carefully reviewing the briefs and\n\nrecord on appeal, we affirm substantially for the reasons\n\nstated by the district judge.\n\n            We emphasize only that the appellant never offered\n\nany evidence about the waiver’s actual consequences for hiring\n\nat     Cumberland   Farms.       His     speculative   reasoning    was\n\ninsufficient to survive summary judgment. After all, the issue\n\nwas not whether such a waiver could be discriminatory under\n\nsome    circumstances,   but   whether    Cumberland   Farms   actually\n\ndiscriminated. Minimally, the appellant needed to produce some\nnon-speculative evidence about actual and expected rates of\n\nminority applicants or employees at Cumberland Farms.\n            Although the appellant tends to suggest that the\nwaiver was illegal as a matter of law, he provides no pertinent\n\nauthority.     In Griggs v. Duke Power Company, 401 U.S. 424\n\n(1971), unlike the present case, the plaintiffs showed, inter\n\nalia, that the challenged policy was actually detrimental to\n\nminority employees.          In addition, the    appellant makes no\n\nshowing that employers are prohibited from seeking information\n\nfrom third parties under either M. G. L. c. 151B, § 4(9) or M.\n\nG. L. c. 6, § 172.
