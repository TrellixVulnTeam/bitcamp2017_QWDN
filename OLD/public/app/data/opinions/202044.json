This appeal concerns a claim for\n\ninsurance coverage following a maritime loss.                    The matter was\n\ndecided by the district judge adversely to the plaintiff, Frank P.\n\nGrande (\"Frank P.\"), on the defendants' motion for judgment as a\n\nmatter of law at the close of plaintiff's case during the trial\n\nbefore a jury.       Grande v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 365 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 57, 59 (D. Me. 2005).           We therefore recite the facts based\n\nupon the evidence offered by the plaintiff, drawing inferences in\n\nhis favor.    Guilloty Perez v. Pierluisi, 339 F.3d 43, 50 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).\n\n             Frank   P.     owned    a   25-foot    Catalina   sailboat   called\n\nAPHRODITE, based in Maine. He had charter insurance for the vessel\n\nfrom   St.   Paul    Fire   &   Marine    Insurance    Company    (\"St.   Paul\"),\n\nobtained through Charter Lakes Marine Insurance (\"Charter Lakes\"),\n\nwhich was an authorized agent of St. Paul.              The latest version of\n\nthe policy limited coverage to \"Atlantic coastal waters of the\n\nUnited States between Eastport, ME and St. Marys, GA, not more than\n\n100 miles from shore, Coastal Atlantic Maine.\"\n\n             In spring 2003, Frank P. found a new sailboat, a 44-foot\n\nIrwin named GINA, in Miami, Florida.               His cousin, Frank A. Grande\n\n(\"Frank A.\"), paid for the vessel, on the understanding that Frank\n\nP. would own and operate the vessel and eventually pay Frank A.\n\nback the purchase price.            Frank P. planned to sail the GINA from\n\nMiami back up to Maine and to use it in his charter business in\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fplace of the APHRODITE.       He contacted Mark VanEpps of Charter\n\nLakes, requesting coverage for chartering the vessel in Maine and\n\nfor his trip from Florida to Maine.\n\n             On or about April 28, 2003, VanEpps faxed an insurance\n\nquote and application to Frank P., who filled out the application,\n\nlisting himself as owner and sole operator, and faxed it back to\n\nVanEpps. The quote included one-time trip coverage from Florida to\n\nMaine for a $150 premium.     According to Frank P., he told VanEpps\n\nthat he wanted to get the GINA from Florida to Maine \"in a timely\n\nfashion and as the crow flies.\"\n\n             Prior to Frank P.'s departure from Miami on May 6, 2003,\n\nVanEpps reported by telephone to Frank P. (who had not yet received\n\nthe new policy) that he was now covered by St. Paul and thus was\n\n\"good to go\" with the GINA on his voyage to Maine.    On the trip to\n\nMaine, the GINA sought to evade bad weather near Cape Hatteras,\n\nadjusted her course southeast, and was 150 to 160 nautical miles\n\nfrom shore when Frank P. and crew were rescued by the Coast Guard\n\non May 17.    The vessel, although later salvaged, was effectively a\n\ntotal loss.\n\n             After the incident, Frank P. received a formal St. Paul\n\npolicy for the GINA dated May 19, 2003 (the day after he had called\n\nCharter Lakes to notify it of the loss), containing an endorsement\n\ncovering the trip but also stating that the GINA was covered only\n\nwithin 100 miles from shore.    When Frank P. filed a claim with St.\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fPaul, it was rejected on the ground that the GINA had been outside\n\nthe 100-mile limit when the loss occurred.\n\n              Several months later, Frank P. brought this diversity\n\nsuit against St. Paul and Charter Lakes in federal district court\n\nin Maine.      Frank P.'s contract claim asserted insurance coverage.\n\nA separate negligence claim charged Charter Lakes with failing to\n\nprocure the insurance that Frank P. requested, and with failing to\n\nnotify him of the supposed 100-mile limit prior to his departure\n\n(contrary to its alleged practice in prior dealings with Frank P.).\n\nFrank P. also asserted an estoppel claim,1 arguing that St. Paul\n\nwas barred from denying coverage because of his justified reliance\n\non their unreasonably misleading conduct.\n\n              The case was tried to a jury in April 2005, but after the\n\nclose of Frank P.'s evidence, the district court granted judgment\n\nfor the defendants as a matter of law.          Grande, 365 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n59.       In substance, the court said that Frank P. had failed to\n\nestablish     contract   coverage   for   the   trip   he   took;   that   any\n\ninsurance coverage he did procure was voidable because of the\n\nfailure to disclose Frank A.'s interest; and that the negligence\n\n\n      1\n      Estoppel is not ordinarily viewed as an independent cause of\naction, but as a set of rules preventing someone in specified\ncircumstances from altering or contesting a proposition. Prosser\n& Keeton on Torts ยง 105, at 733 (5th ed. 1984). Maine case law is\nunclear. Compare Waterville Homes, Inc. v. Me. Dep't of Transp.,\n589 A.2d 455, 457 (Me. 1991) (noting that estoppel functions only\nas \"an equitable affirmative defense\"), with Martin v. Prudential\nIns. Co., 389 A.2d 28, 30-32 (Me. 1978) (treating equitable\nestoppel as an independent theory of recovery).\n\n                                    -4-\n\fand estoppel claims foundered because of the non-disclosure and\n\nbecause Frank P. had failed to show that anyone else would have\n\ninsured him outside the 100-mile limit.   Id. at 62-67.\n\n          On this appeal, review is de novo because the district\n\ncourt granted judgment as a matter of law, and we take Frank P.'s\n\nevidence in the light most favorable to his case and assume\n\ncredibility issues in his favor.   Guilloty Perez, 339 F.3d at 50.\n\nWe accept the parties' view that Maine law applies except so far as\n\nit might be displaced by a governing federal rule applicable to\n\nmaritime matters. See Wilburn Boat Co. v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co.,\n\n348 U.S. 310, 319-21 (1955); Greenly v. Mariner Mgmt. Group, Inc.,\n\n192 F.3d 22, 25-26 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n          We begin with Frank P.'s contract theory, which, if\n\nsuccessful, likely looks to liability of St. Paul rather than\n\nCharter Lakes; an agent who acts for a disclosed principal is not\n\nordinarily party to the contract or liable for its breach by the\n\nprincipal.   See County Forest Prods., Inc. v. Green Mountain\n\nAgency, Inc., 758 A.2d 59, 69 (Me. 2000).   Here, Frank P. has not\n\nsought to recover on the policy as issued, regarding that avenue as\n\nblocked by the specific endorsement language excluding coverage\n\nbeyond the 100-mile limit.\n\n          Instead, Frank P. argues in substance that the contract\n\nin force during his trip was a temporary \"binder\" contract that\n\nfilled the gap until a formal policy later issued, and that the\n\n\n                               -5-\n\fformal policy misstated the coverage agreed to for the trip.                       This\n\nbinder contract, in Frank P.'s view, was formed by the exchanges\n\nbetween the parties, including VanEpps' ultimate \"good to go\"\n\nassertion, and does not incorporate any 100-mile limit on the trip\n\nfrom Florida to Maine.         According to Frank P.'s testimony, he told\n\nVanEpps that he was requesting trip insurance and VanEpps told him\n\nafter receiving the completed application back that he was covered.\n\n            Frank P. testified that he told VanEpps that he planned\n\nto travel from Florida to Maine in a straight line (specifically,\n\n\"as the crow flies\"). During opening arguments, Frank P.'s counsel\n\nstated that such a route would have taken Frank P. outside of the\n\n100-mile limit; although this statement itself was not evidence,\n\nUnited States v. Rose, 104 F.3d 1408, 1416 (1st Cir. 1997), cert.\n\ndenied,    520   U.S.   1258    (1997),    Frank     P.   later     submitted      into\n\nevidence a chart from which the jury could have determined that\n\nsuch a route would naturally have taken the GINA outside of a 100-\n\nmile limit between Cape Hatteras and Maine.\n\n            Frank P. further testified as to past practice in his\n\ndealings    with   Charter     Lakes.      He      claimed   that    in   the   past,\n\nnavigational limits for the APHRODITE had been cited in Charter\n\nLakes' quote letter, and that the written binder issued thereafter\n\nhad cited those same limits, which in turn were cited in the\n\nformally    issued   policy.       Frank      P.   testified   that       during    his\n\n\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fnegotiations with VanEpps, no navigational limit was mentioned by\n\nVanEpps as to the trip from Florida to Maine.\n\n           In granting judgment for defendants as a matter of law,\n\nthe district judge took the view that, under general law applicable\n\nto insurance, a temporary binder provides only that coverage that\n\nis common practice in the industry and that it was Frank P.'s\n\nobligation--as the claimant under a binder contract--to establish\n\nthat such insurance could be procured from St. Paul or others\n\nwithout a 100-mile limit.        Grande, 365 F. Supp. 2d at 63-64.\n\nAdmittedly, Frank P. offered no evidence on this issue one way or\n\nthe other.\n\n           Case law does use common practice to fill in missing\n\nterms where, as is ordinarily the case, the binder arrangement is\n\na temporary measure and contains little detail of its own. \"[W]hen\n\na loss occurs after a binder has been issued, but before a policy\n\nis written, the insurer is bound to provide coverage in line with\n\nits   standard   policies   referenced   in   the   binder,   or   policies\n\nstandard throughout the industry.\"        Pine Ridge Realty, Inc. v.\n\nMass. Bay Ins. Co., 752 A.2d 595, 599 (Me. 2000) (citations\n\nomitted); see also Acadia Ins. Co. v. Allied Marine Transp. LLC,\n\n151 F. Supp. 2d 107, 125 (D. Me. 2001).       If Frank P.'s binder claim\n\nrested on a general request for insurance followed by a standard\n\nbinder commitment by VanEpps, this would be a different case.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f          Here, however, Frank P. does not claim merely that he\n\nasked that insurance be switched from APHRODITE to GINA, which\n\nmight easily be understood as importing the existing 100-mile limit\n\ncontained in the APHRODITE policy or as compelling a search for\n\ncommon practice.   Rather, he testified that he also asked VanEpps\n\nfor coverage for the trip from Florida to Maine and that he told\n\nVanEpps that the GINA would follow the most direct course (which a\n\nreasonable jury might find--based on the chart submitted into\n\nevidence--would take her more than 100 miles offshore).\n\n          The \"common practice\" rule does not apply if a \"special\n\nagreement\" has been made in the course of contracting. Acadia Ins.\n\nCo. v. Allied Marine Transp. LLC, 151 F. Supp. 2d 107, 125 (D. Me.\n\n2001) (\"The general rule regarding the terms of an oral binder or\n\ncontract for temporary insurance pending issuance of a written\n\npolicy consists, in the absence of a special agreement, of the\n\nusual provisions of contracts employed to effect like insurance.\"\n\n(emphasis added)).   Thus, when VanEpps said that insurance was in\n\nforce, a jury could find (although not obliged to do so) that the\n\nparties were agreeing that the insurance was in force for the trip\n\nas described by Frank P. to VanEpps.\n\n          Defendants   might   say    that   the   conversations   were\n\ndifferent or urge different inferences, but these would be typical\n\njury issues.   If the facts are resolved in Frank P.'s favor, we\n\nthink that a contract--narrowed to an initial understanding that\n\n\n                                -8-\n\fcoverage would include the trip unconstrained by a 100-mile limit--\n\nmight reasonably be inferred by a jury.   How matters would stand at\n\nthe end of the defense case, if contrary evidence were offered, is\n\nnot something we need to anticipate.\n\n          Two other objections were found by the district court to\n\npreclude recovery. The first was what the district judge described\n\nas Frank P.'s failure to offer proof of causation running from the\n\nalleged wrong to actual harm.   The district judge said that Frank\n\nP. had failed to show that insurance providing the coverage sought\n\nby Frank P.--i.e., for a trip outside the 100-mile limit--would\n\nhave been available either from St. Paul or anyone else.    Grande,\n\n365 F. Supp. 2d at 63-64.\n\n          There is some precedent, including one case from a Maine\n\nsuperior court, that is hostile to claims for a negligent failure\n\nto procure insurance, or even an alleged breach of a promise to\n\nprocure insurance, where it turns out that the sought insurance was\n\nnot in fact available.2     This may make some sense where, as\n\ncommonly appears to be so in these cases, there was no reliance on\n\nthe broker's representation.    This is about the best sense we can\n\nmake of this case law when the facts of the cases are examined.\n\n\n\n     2\n      See Royal Maccabees Life Ins. Co. v. Peterson, 139 F.3d 568,\n570 (7th Cir. 1998); Huff v. Standard Life Ins. Co., 897 F.2d 1072,\n1074 (11th Cir. 1990); Bayly, Martin & Fay, Inc. v. Pete's Satire,\nInc., 739 P.2d 239, 244 (Colo. 1987); Bangor-Brewer Bowling Lanes,\nInc. v. Commercial Union-York Ins. Co., 2001 WL 1719238 (Me. Super.\nCt. Pen. Cty., July 3, 2001).\n\n                                 -9-\n\f            Frank P.'s contract claim does not rest on a promise by\n\nthe broker to seek to procure insurance--it is a claim that the\n\nbroker,    seemingly   with    apparent       authority,     provided   insurance\n\ncoverage    for    breach     of   which      (one   would    expect)    ordinary\n\nexpectation damages are available.             And, just to wrap matters up,\n\neven a negligence claim would on the present facts arguably rest on\n\nactual reliance (given Frank P.'s testimony that he would not have\n\ntraveled outside of the 100-mile navigational limit had he known\n\nthat such a limit attached).        Thus, the causation objection is not\n\nenough to justify the directed verdict.\n\n            The district court's other objection was that Frank P.'s\n\nwritten application for the insurance was materially false because\n\nit represented him as the GINA's \"registered owner\" and did not\n\ndisclose Frank A.'s interest anywhere on the application.                 365 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 64-67.      The district court said that under Maine law,\n\n\"[a]n insured must disclose in an application for insurance all\n\nknown circumstances that materially affect the insurer's risks,\"\n\nid. at 65, adding that the doctrine is especially stringent under\n\ngeneral    maritime    law     where    marine       insurance    policies    are\n\n\"traditionally contracts uberrimae fidei.\"                 Id. (quoting Windsor\n\nMount Joy Mut. Ins. Co. v. Giragosian, 57 F.3d 50, 54 (1st Cir.\n\n1995)).    \"Uberrimae fidei\" roughly translates as \"of the utmost\n\ngood faith.\"      Black's Law Dictionary 1558 (8th ed. 2004).\n\n\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\f           Regardless of whether the stricter maritime doctrine\n\napplies (as opposed to Maine law), we find that a jury issue is\n\npresented.   In the application that Frank P. faxed to VanEpps, the\n\nentry for \"registered owner(s) or [l]essee(s)\" was answered with\n\nFrank P.'s name and address.   It may be debatable whether Frank P.\n\nwas the \"owner\"; on the one hand, his cousin, Frank A., paid for\n\nthe vessel and the bill of sale was made out to Frank A.     On the\n\nother hand, Frank P. testified that it was understood between the\n\ntwo cousins that Frank P. then became the owner of the boat,\n\nsubject to an obligation to repay the purchase price in due course.\n\n           If Frank P.'s testimony is credited, then he might be\n\nregarded as \"the owner\" in the legal sense (given the intention of\n\nthe cousins as to ownership) and in the economic sense (if, as\n\nappears to have been the case, Frank P. bore the risk of loss in\n\nthe event that the boat sank uninsured).      Again, the defendants\n\ncould contest the facts and the inferences, but it is hard to see\n\nhow a verdict on the contrary premise could be directed.\n\n           Admittedly, Frank P. was apparently not the \"registered\n\nowner\" when the application was submitted.    This phrase refers to\n\na filing with an official registry for vessels, such as is afforded\n\nby individual states or by the Coast Guard.   Frank P. said that his\n\nplan was to register the vessel in his name when he got to Maine.\n\nIt is unclear that any such filing was ever made in Frank A.'s\n\nname.   Based on Frank P.'s testimony, a jury could reasonably find\n\n\n                                -11-\n\fhim to be the \"owner,\" but not the \"registered owner,\" of the\n\nvessel at the time it sailed.\n\n           Absent    a    different    regime   imposed     by    statute,   an\n\ninsurance contract is ordinarily voidable if a false statement in\n\nthe application was \"material\"--materiality meaning something that\n\naffects the risk and might lead either to a higher premium or a\n\nrefusal of insurance. There are various formulations: one treatise\n\nsays that in the marine insurance context, a material fact is \"that\n\nwhich can possibly influence the mind of a prudent and intelligent\n\ninsurer in determining whether it will accept the risk.\"                     4A\n\nAppleman & Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice ยง 2651 (rev. ed.\n\nSupp. 2005).\n\n           Materiality, although largely a matter of applying a\n\nlegal   standard    to   particular    facts,   is   one   of    those   \"mixed\"\n\nquestions that, like \"negligence,\" is ordinarily left to the trier\n\nof fact unless the outcome is so clear that a reasonable jury could\n\ndecide it only one way.         \"[C]ourts and commentators have long\n\nrecognized that materiality is primarily a question of fact, the\n\nresolution of which is necessarily a function of context and\n\ncircumstances.\"      Dopp v. Pritzker, 38 F.3d 1239, 1244 (1st Cir.\n\n1994), cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1108 (1995); see also Howard Fire\n\nIns. Co. v. Chase, 72 U.S. 509, 515 (1866).           Tradition and policy\n\nmake this a reasonable assignment of functions.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\f          Ownership of the insured property is normally a material\n\nfact in an insurance contract, see, e.g., Cigna Prop. & Cas. Ins.\n\nCo. v. Polaris Pictures Corp., 159 F.3d 412, 420 (9th Cir. 1998),\n\ncert. denied, 528 U.S. 815 (1999); among other things, the owner is\n\nthe main party with an insurable interest, and the owner ordinarily\n\nhas the primary incentive to safeguard the property (which reduces\n\nthe risk).     But if Frank P.'s testimony is accepted, he arguably\n\nwas the owner in both senses.         The district court seemed to think\n\nthat Frank A. was the real owner, but given Frank P.'s testimony,\n\nthis is a matter for the jury; indeed, it appears quite possible\n\nthat Frank A. was not the owner when the insurance was sought.\n\n          It    might   still    be   \"material\"   that   the   application\n\ninaccurately described Frank P. as the registered owner, but why is\n\nnot so evident as to justify judgment as a matter of law.           Neither\n\nthe district court nor St. Paul's brief explains why registration\n\nis significant to the risk.        There may well be a reason that St.\n\nPaul can adduce at trial.       But, for now, it is an open question why\n\nthe insurer would care whether Frank P., if the real owner,\n\ncompleted the registration before or after he arrived in Maine.\n\n          The district judge seemed to say that, in any event, it\n\nwas material that Frank A. had purchased the boat in the first\n\ninstance, transferred it orally, but had not yet been paid.           It is\n\nnot clear that any question in the application called for a\n\ndisclosure of such facts; for example, if Frank P. had purchased\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fthe vessel from the manufacturer with no money down and then\n\nregistered it in his name, nothing in the application seemed to\n\ncall for this to be disclosed.   Under ordinary contract law, false\n\nstatements can undermine contracts, but an affirmative duty to\n\ndisclose is not universal.    1 Farnsworth on Contracts ยง 3.26c(3),\n\nat 409-10 (3d ed. 2004).\n\n           Nevertheless, under the strict maritime rule of uberrimae\n\nfidei, an insured must make \"full disclosure of all material facts\n\nof which the insured has, or ought to have, knowledge . . . even\n\nthough no inquiry be made.\"   7 Russ & Segalla, Couch on Insurance\n\nยง 99:2 (3d ed. 1997) (footnote omitted); see also HIH Marine Servs.\n\nv. Fraser, 211 F.3d 1359, 1362 (11th Cir. 2000); Cigna, 159 F.3d at\n\n420.   This doctrine apparently rests on the special circumstances\n\nof maritime insurance in which the insurer may have less than\n\nordinary opportunities to inspect and verify.\n\n           Yet even if the maritime rule appliesโ-whether Maine law\n\nwould apply the same approach anyway has not been briefed--judgment\n\nas a matter of law was not justified here.   Frank A. testified that\n\nhe never intended to possess or operate the vessel, and Frank P.\n\nsaid that he owned the vessel, owing Frank A. the purchase price.\n\nIt is not clear why this arrangement would affect the insurer's\n\nrisk assessment (although reasons might be adduced during the\n\ndefendants' case at trial).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\f            We therefore conclude that as to Frank P.'s contract\n\nclaim against St. Paul, judgment as a matter of law should not have\n\nbeen granted.       This brings us to the negligence and estoppel\n\nclaims. Frank P. argues that such claims would survive even if the\n\ncontract claim fell; the district judge treated both non-contract\n\ntheories as more or less variations on the same theme as the\n\ncontract claim, and, after disposing of the contract claim, found\n\nthat the other two followed suit.\n\n            In principle, the contract, negligence, and estoppel\n\nclaims are not identical as to elements or even parties.                          For\n\nexample, while there is normally no liability of the agent for the\n\nprincipal's breach of contract, an agent may sometimes be liable in\n\nnegligence to one with whom he deals, County Forest Prods., 758\n\nA.2d at 69-70, while the principal may or may not be liable; and\n\nobviously    whether   one   made       and   breached   a    contract    or    acted\n\nnegligently    in   breach    of    a    duty    of   care    are   two   different\n\nquestions.\n\n            Here,   the      district         court   ruled     that      the    same\n\nconsiderations that it deemed to bar the contract claim--the\n\ndisclosure flaws and lack of causation--also barred the alternative\n\nclaims.     Because we disagree with the premise as applied to the\n\ncontract claim, no lengthy discussion of its extension to the other\n\ntwo claims is needed; they too must be remanded for further\n\nproceedings.    However, we caution against too ready an assumption\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\fthat   the    answers   or    defenses    that   work   against   one    claim\n\nnecessarily work against all.\n\n             The judgment of the district court is vacated and the\n\nmatter   remanded   for      further   proceedings   consistent   with    this\n\ndecision.

The matter was decided by the district judge adversely to the plaintiff, Frank P. Grande (\"Frank P.\"), on the defendants' motion for judgment as a matter of law at the close of plaintiff's case during the trial before a jury. <i>Grande v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co.,</i> 365 F.Supp.2d 57, 59 (D.Me.2005). We therefore recite the facts based upon the evidence offered by the plaintiff, drawing inferences in his favor. <i>Guilloty Perez v. Pierluisi,</i> 339 F.3d 43, 50 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Frank P. owned a 25-foot Catalina sailboat called APHRODITE, based in Maine. He had charter insurance for the vessel from St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Company (\"St.Paul\"), obtained through Charter Lakes Marine Insurance (\"Charter Lakes\"), which was an authorized agent of St. Paul. The latest version of the policy limited coverage to \"Atlantic coastal waters of the United States between Eastport, ME and St. Marys, GA, not more than 100 miles from shore, Coastal Atlantic Maine.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In spring 2003, Frank P. found a new sailboat, a 44-foot Irwin named GINA, in Miami, Florida. His cousin, Frank A. Grande (\"Frank A.\"), paid for the vessel, on the understanding that Frank P. would own and operate the vessel and eventually pay Frank A. back the purchase price. Frank P. planned to sail the GINA from Miami back up to Maine and to use it in his charter business in place of the APHRODITE. He contacted Mark VanEpps of Charter Lakes, requesting coverage for chartering the vessel in Maine and for his trip from Florida to Maine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or about April 28, 2003, VanEpps faxed an insurance quote and application to Frank P., who filled out the application, listing himself as owner and sole operator, and faxed it back to VanEpps. The quote included one-time trip coverage from Florida to Maine for a $150 premium. According to Frank P., he told VanEpps that he wanted to get the GINA from Florida to Maine \"in a timely fashion and as the crow flies.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to Frank P.'s departure from Miami on May 6, 2003, VanEpps reported by telephone to Frank P. (who had not yet received the new policy) that he was now covered by St. Paul and thus was \"good to go\" with the GINA on his voyage to Maine. On the trip to Maine, the GINA sought to evade bad weather near Cape Hatteras, adjusted her course southeast, and was 150 to 160 nautical miles from shore when Frank P. and crew were rescued by the Coast Guard on May 17. The vessel, although later salvaged, was effectively a total loss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the incident, Frank P. received a formal St. Paul policy for the GINA dated May 19, 2003 (the day after he had called Charter Lakes to notify it of the loss), containing an endorsement covering the trip but also stating that the GINA was covered only within 100 miles from shore. When Frank P. filed a claim with St. Paul, it was rejected on the ground that the GINA had been outside the 100-mile limit when the loss occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several months later, Frank P. brought this diversity suit against St. Paul and Charter Lakes in federal district court in Maine. Frank P.'s contract claim asserted insurance coverage. A separate negligence claim charged Charter Lakes with failing to procure the insurance that Frank P. requested, and with failing to notify him of the supposed 100-mile limit prior to his departure (contrary to its alleged practice in prior dealings with Frank P.). Frank P. also asserted an estoppel claim,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> arguing that St. Paul was barred from denying coverage because of his justified reliance on their unreasonably misleading conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was tried to a jury in April 2005, but after the close of Frank P.'s evidence, the district court granted judgment for the defendants as a matter of law. <i>Grande,</i> 365 F.Supp.2d at 59. In substance, the court said that Frank P. had failed to establish contract coverage for the trip he took; that any insurance coverage he did procure was voidable because of the failure to disclose Frank A.'s interest; and that the negligence and estoppel claims foundered because of the non-disclosure and because Frank P. had failed to show that anyone else would have insured him outside the 100-mile limit. <i>Id.</i> at 62-67.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal, review is <i>de novo</i> because the district court granted judgment as a matter of law, and we take Frank P.'s evidence in the light most favorable to his case and assume credibility issues in his favor. <i>Guilloty Perez,</i> 339 F.3d at 50. We accept the parties' view that Maine law applies except so far as it might be displaced by a governing federal rule applicable to maritime matters. <i>See Wilburn Boat Co. v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co.,</i> 348 U.S. 310, 319-21, 75 S.Ct. 368, 99 L.Ed. 337 (1955); <i>Greenly v. Mariner Mgmt. Group, Inc.,</i> 192 F.3d 22, 25-26 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with Frank P.'s contract theory, which, if successful, likely looks to liability of St. Paul rather than Charter Lakes; an agent who acts for a disclosed principal is not ordinarily party to the contract or liable for its breach by the principal. <i>See County Forest Prods., Inc. v. Green Mountain Agency, Inc.,</i> 758 A.2d 59, 69 (Me.2000). Here, Frank P. has not sought to recover on the policy <i>as issued,</i> regarding that avenue as blocked by the specific endorsement language excluding coverage beyond the 100-mile limit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, Frank P. argues in substance that the contract in force during his trip was a temporary \"binder\" contract that filled the gap until a formal policy later issued, and that the formal policy misstated the coverage agreed to for the trip. This binder contract, in Frank P.'s view, was formed by the exchanges between the parties, including VanEpps' ultimate \"good to go\" assertion, and does not incorporate any 100-mile limit on the trip from Florida to Maine. According to Frank P.'s testimony, he told VanEpps that he was requesting trip insurance and VanEpps told him after receiving the completed application back that he was covered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Frank P. testified that he told VanEpps that he planned to travel from Florida to Maine in a straight line (specifically, \"as the crow flies\"). During opening arguments, Frank P.'s counsel stated that such a route would have taken Frank P. outside of the 100-mile limit; although this statement itself was not evidence, <i>United States v. Rose,</i> 104 F.3d 1408, 1416 (1st Cir.1997), <i>cert. denied,</i> 520 U.S. 1258, 117 S.Ct. 2424, 138 L.Ed.2d 187 (1997), Frank P. later submitted into evidence a chart from which the jury could have determined that such a route would naturally have taken the GINA outside of a 100-mile limit between Cape Hatteras and Maine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Frank P. further testified as to past practice in his dealings with Charter Lakes. He claimed that in the past, navigational limits for the APHRODITE had been cited in Charter Lakes' quote letter, and that the written binder issued thereafter had cited those same limits, which in turn were cited in the formally issued policy. Frank P. testified that during his negotiations with VanEpps, no navigational limit was mentioned by VanEpps as to the trip from Florida to Maine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In granting judgment for defendants as a matter of law, the district judge took the view that, under general law applicable to insurance, a temporary binder provides only that coverage that is common practice in the industry and that it was Frank P.'s obligation&#8212;as the claimant under a binder contract&#8212;to establish that such insurance could be procured from St. Paul or others without a 100-mile limit. <i>Grande,</i> 365 F.Supp.2d at 63-64. Admittedly, Frank P. offered no evidence on this issue one way or the other.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Case law does use common practice to fill in missing terms where, as is ordinarily the case, the binder arrangement is a temporary measure and contains little detail of its own. \"[W]hen a loss occurs after a binder has been issued, but before a policy is written, the insurer is bound to provide coverage in line with its standard policies referenced in the binder, or policies standard throughout the industry.\" <i>Pine Ridge Realty, Inc. v. Mass. Bay Ins. Co.,</i> 752 A.2d 595, 599 (Me.2000) (citations omitted); <i>see also Acadia Ins. Co. v. Allied Marine Transp. LLC,</i> 151 F.Supp.2d 107, 125 (D.Me.2001). If Frank P.'s binder claim rested on a general request for insurance followed by a standard binder commitment by VanEpps, this would be a different case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, Frank P. does not claim merely that he asked that insurance be switched from APHRODITE to GINA, which might easily be understood as importing the existing 100-mile limit contained in the APHRODITE policy or as compelling a search for common practice. Rather, he testified that he also asked VanEpps for coverage for the trip from Florida to Maine and that he told VanEpps that the GINA would follow the most direct course (which a reasonable jury might find&#8212;based on the chart submitted into evidence&#8212;would take her more than 100 miles offshore).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"common practice\" rule does not apply if a \"special agreement\" has been made in the course of contracting. <i>Acadia Ins. Co. v. Allied Marine Transp. LLC,</i> 151 F.Supp.2d 107, 125 (D.Me.2001) (\"The general rule regarding the terms of an oral binder or contract for temporary insurance pending issuance of a written policy consists, <i>in the absence of a special agreement,</i> of the usual provisions of contracts employed to effect like insurance.\" (emphasis added)). Thus, when VanEpps said that insurance was in force, a jury could find (although not obliged to do so) that the parties were agreeing that the insurance was in force for the trip as described by Frank P. to VanEpps.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants might say that the conversations were different or urge different inferences, but these would be typical jury issues. If the facts are resolved in Frank P.'s favor, we think that a contract&#8212;narrowed to an initial understanding that coverage would include the trip unconstrained by a 100-mile limit&#8212;might reasonably be inferred by a jury. How matters would stand at the end of the defense case, if contrary evidence were offered, is not something we need to anticipate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two other objections were found by the district court to preclude recovery. The first was what the district judge described as Frank P.'s failure to offer proof of causation running from the alleged wrong to actual harm. The district judge said that Frank P. had failed to show that insurance providing the coverage sought by Frank P.&#8212;<i>i.e.,</i> for a trip outside the 100-mile limit&#8212;would have been available either from St. Paul or anyone else. <i>Grande,</i> 365 F.Supp.2d at 63-64.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is some precedent, including one case from a Maine superior court, that is hostile to claims for a negligent failure to procure insurance, or even an alleged breach of a promise to procure insurance, where it turns out that the sought insurance was not in fact available.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> This may make some sense where, as commonly appears to be so in these cases, there was no reliance on the broker's representation. This is about the best sense we can make of this case law when the facts of the cases are examined.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Frank P.'s contract claim does not rest on a promise by the broker to seek to procure insurance&#8212;it is a claim that the broker, seemingly with apparent authority, provided insurance coverage for breach of which (one would expect) ordinary expectation damages are available. And, just to wrap matters up, even a negligence claim would on the present facts arguably rest on actual reliance (given Frank P.'s testimony that he would not have traveled outside of the 100-mile navigational limit had he known that such a limit attached). Thus, the causation objection is not enough to justify the directed verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's other objection was that Frank P.'s written application for the insurance was materially false because it represented him as the GINA's \"registered owner\" and did not disclose Frank A.'s interest anywhere on the application. 365 F.Supp.2d at 64-67. The district court said that under Maine law, \"[a]n insured must disclose in an application for insurance all known circumstances that materially affect the insurer's risks,\" <i>id.</i> at 65, adding that the doctrine is especially stringent under general maritime law where marine insurance policies are \"traditionally contracts <i>uberrimae fidei.\" Id.</i> (quoting <i>Windsor Mount Joy Mut. Ins. Co. v. Giragosian,</i> 57 F.3d 50, 54 (1st Cir.1995)). \"<i>Uberrimae fidei</i>\" roughly translates as \"of the utmost good faith.\" <i>Black's Law Dictionary</i> 1558 (8th ed.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regardless of whether the stricter maritime doctrine applies (as opposed to Maine law), we find that a jury issue is presented. In the application that Frank P. faxed to VanEpps, the entry for \"registered owner(s) or [l]essee(s)\" was answered with Frank P.'s name and address. It may be debatable whether Frank P. was the \"owner\"; on the one hand, his cousin, Frank A., paid for the vessel and the bill of sale was made out to Frank A. On the other hand, Frank P. testified that it was understood between the two cousins that Frank P. then became the owner of the boat, subject to an obligation to repay the purchase price in due course.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If Frank P.'s testimony is credited, then he might be regarded as \"the owner\" in the legal sense (given the intention of the cousins as to ownership) and in the economic sense (if, as appears to have been the case, Frank P. bore the risk of loss in the event that the boat sank uninsured). Again, the defendants could contest the facts and the inferences, but it is hard to see how a verdict on the contrary premise could be directed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admittedly, Frank P. was apparently not the \"registered owner\" when the application was submitted. This phrase refers to a filing with an official registry for vessels, such as is afforded by individual states or by the Coast Guard. Frank P. said that his plan was to register the vessel in his name when he got to Maine. It is unclear that any such filing was ever made in Frank A.'s name. Based on Frank P.'s testimony, a jury could reasonably find him to be the \"owner,\" but not the \"registered owner,\" of the vessel at the time it sailed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Absent a different regime imposed by statute, an insurance contract is ordinarily voidable if a false statement in the application was \"material\"&#8212;materiality meaning something that affects the risk and might lead either to a higher premium or a refusal of insurance. There are various formulations: one treatise says that in the marine insurance context, a material fact is \"that which can possibly influence the mind of a prudent and intelligent insurer in determining whether it will accept the risk.\" 4A Appleman &amp; Appleman, <i>Insurance Law and Practice</i> &#167; 2651 (rev. ed. Supp.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Materiality, although largely a matter of applying a legal standard to particular facts, is one of those \"mixed\" questions that, like \"negligence,\" is ordinarily left to the trier of fact unless the outcome is so clear that a reasonable jury could decide it only one way. \"[C]ourts and commentators have long recognized that materiality is primarily a question of fact, the resolution of which is necessarily a function of context and circumstances.\" <i>Dopp v. Pritzker,</i> 38 F.3d 1239, 1244 (1st Cir.1994), <i>cert. denied,</i> 514 U.S. 1108, 115 S.Ct. 1959, 131 L.Ed.2d 851 (1995); <i>see also Howard Fire Ins. Co. v. Chase,</i> 5 Wall. 509, 72 U.S. 509, 515, 18 L.Ed. 524 (1866). Tradition and policy make this a reasonable assignment of functions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ownership of the insured property is normally a material fact in an insurance contract, <i>see, e.g., Cigna Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. v. Polaris Pictures Corp.,</i> 159 F.3d 412, 420 (9th Cir.1998), <i>cert. denied,</i> 528 U.S. 815, 120 S.Ct. 53, 145 L.Ed.2d 46 (1999); among other things, the owner is the main party with an insurable interest, and the owner ordinarily has the primary incentive to safeguard the property (which reduces the risk). But if Frank P.'s testimony is accepted, he arguably was the owner in both senses. The district court seemed to think that Frank A. was the real owner, but given Frank P.'s testimony, this is a matter for the jury; indeed, it appears quite possible that Frank A. was not the owner when the insurance was sought.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It might still be \"material\" that the application inaccurately described Frank P. as the <i>registered</i> owner, but why is not so evident as to justify judgment as a matter of law. Neither the district court nor St. Paul's brief explains why registration is significant to the risk. There may well be a reason that St. Paul can adduce at trial. But, for now, it is an open question why the insurer would care whether Frank P., if the real owner, completed the registration before or after he arrived in Maine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge seemed to say that, in any event, it was material that Frank A. had purchased the boat in the first instance, transferred it orally, but had not yet been paid. It is not clear that any question in the application called for a disclosure of such facts; for example, if Frank P. had purchased the vessel from the manufacturer with no money down and then registered it in his name, nothing in the application seemed to call for this to be disclosed. Under ordinary contract law, false statements can undermine contracts, but an affirmative duty to disclose is not universal. 1 <i>Farnsworth on Contracts</i> &#167; 3.26c(3), at 409-10 (3d ed.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, under the strict maritime rule of <i>uberrimae fidei,</i> an insured must make \"full disclosure of all material facts of which the insured has, or ought to have, knowledge ... even though no inquiry be made.\" 7 Russ &amp; Segalla, <i>Couch on Insurance</i> &#167; 99:2 (3d ed.1997) (footnote omitted); <i>see also HIH Marine Servs. v. Fraser,</i> 211 F.3d 1359, 1362 (11th Cir.2000); <i>Cigna,</i> 159 F.3d at 420. This doctrine apparently rests on the special circumstances of maritime insurance in which the insurer may have less than ordinary opportunities to inspect and verify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet even if the maritime rule applies&#8212;whether Maine law would apply the same approach anyway has not been briefed&#8212;judgment as a matter of law was not justified here. Frank A. testified that he never intended to possess or operate the vessel, and Frank P. said that he owned the vessel, owing Frank A. the purchase price. It is not clear why this arrangement would affect the insurer's risk assessment (although reasons might be adduced during the defendants' case at trial).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore conclude that as to Frank P.'s contract claim against St. Paul, judgment as a matter of law should not have been granted. This brings us to the negligence and estoppel claims. Frank P. argues that such claims would survive even if the contract claim fell; the district judge treated both non-contract theories as more or less variations on the same theme as the contract claim, and, after disposing of the contract claim, found that the other two followed suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In principle, the contract, negligence, and estoppel claims are not identical as to elements or even parties. For example, while there is normally no liability of the agent for the principal's breach of contract, an agent may sometimes be liable in negligence to one with whom he deals, <i>County Forest Prods.,</i> 758 A.2d at 69-70, while the principal may or may not be liable; and obviously whether one made and breached a contract or acted negligently in breach of a duty of care are two different questions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court ruled that the same considerations that it deemed to bar the contract claim&#8212;the disclosure flaws and lack of causation&#8212;also barred the alternative claims. Because we disagree with the premise as applied to the contract claim, no lengthy discussion of its extension to the other two claims is needed; they too must be remanded for further proceedings. However, we caution against too ready an assumption that the answers or defenses that work against one claim necessarily work against all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is <i>vacated</i> and the matter <i>remanded</i> for further proceedings consistent with this decision.

He had charter insurance for the vessel from St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Company (\"St.Paul\"), obtained through Charter Lakes Marine Insurance (\"Charter Lakes\"), which was an authorized agent of St. Paul. The latest version of the policy limited coverage to \"Atlantic coastal waters of the United States between Eastport, ME and St. Marys, GA, not more than 100 miles from shore, Coastal Atlantic Maine.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In spring 2003, Frank P. found a new sailboat, a 44-foot Irwin named GINA, in Miami, Florida. His cousin, Frank A. Grande (\"Frank A.\"), paid for the vessel, on the understanding that Frank P. would own and operate the vessel and eventually pay Frank A. back the purchase price. Frank P. planned to sail the GINA from Miami back up to Maine and to use it in his charter business in place of the APHRODITE. He contacted Mark VanEpps of Charter Lakes, requesting coverage for chartering the vessel in Maine and for his trip from Florida to Maine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or about April 28, 2003, VanEpps faxed an insurance quote and application to Frank P., who filled out the application, listing himself as owner and sole operator, and faxed it back to VanEpps. The quote included one-time trip coverage from Florida to Maine for a $150 premium. According to Frank P., he told VanEpps that he wanted to get the GINA from Florida to Maine \"in a timely fashion and as the crow flies.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to Frank P.'s departure from Miami on May 6, 2003, VanEpps reported by telephone to Frank P. (who had not yet received the new policy) that he was now covered by St. Paul and thus was \"good to go\" with the GINA on his voyage to Maine. On the trip to Maine, the GINA sought to evade bad weather near Cape Hatteras, adjusted her course southeast, and was 150 to 160 nautical miles from shore when Frank P. and crew were rescued by the Coast Guard on May 17. The vessel, although later salvaged, was effectively a total loss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the incident, Frank P. received a formal St. Paul policy for the GINA dated May 19, 2003 (the day after he had called Charter Lakes to notify it of the loss), containing an endorsement covering the trip but also stating that the GINA was covered only within 100 miles from shore. When Frank P. filed a claim with St. Paul, it was rejected on the ground that the GINA had been outside the 100-mile limit when the loss occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several months later, Frank P. brought this diversity suit against St. Paul and Charter Lakes in federal district court in Maine. Frank P.'s contract claim asserted insurance coverage. A separate negligence claim charged Charter Lakes with failing to procure the insurance that Frank P. requested, and with failing to notify him of the supposed 100-mile limit prior to his departure (contrary to its alleged practice in prior dealings with Frank P.). Frank P. also asserted an estoppel claim,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> arguing that St. Paul was barred from denying coverage because of his justified reliance on their unreasonably misleading conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was tried to a jury in April 2005, but after the close of Frank P.'s evidence, the district court granted judgment for the defendants as a matter of law. <i>Grande,</i> 365 F.Supp.2d at 59. In substance, the court said that Frank P. had failed to establish contract coverage for the trip he took; that any insurance coverage he did procure was voidable because of the failure to disclose Frank A.'s interest; and that the negligence and estoppel claims foundered because of the non-disclosure and because Frank P. had failed to show that anyone else would have insured him outside the 100-mile limit. <i>Id.</i> at 62-67.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal, review is <i>de novo</i> because the district court granted judgment as a matter of law, and we take Frank P.'s evidence in the light most favorable to his case and assume credibility issues in his favor. <i>Guilloty Perez,</i> 339 F.3d at 50.

Green Mountain Agency, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">758</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></span>, 69 (Me.2000). Here, Frank P. has not sought to recover on the policy <i>as issued,</i> regarding that avenue as blocked by the specific endorsement language excluding coverage beyond the 100-mile limit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, Frank P. argues in substance that the contract in force during his trip was a temporary \"binder\" contract that filled the gap until a formal policy later issued, and that the formal policy misstated the coverage agreed to for the trip. This binder contract, in Frank P.'s view, was formed by the exchanges between the parties, including VanEpps' ultimate \"good to go\" assertion, and does not incorporate any 100-mile limit on the trip from Florida to Maine. According to Frank P.'s testimony, he told VanEpps that he was requesting trip insurance and VanEpps told him after receiving the completed application back that he was covered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Frank P. testified that he told VanEpps that he planned to travel from Florida to Maine in a straight line (specifically, \"as the crow flies\"). During opening arguments, Frank P.'s counsel stated that such a route would have taken Frank P. outside of the 100-mile limit; although this statement itself was not evidence, <i>United States v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">187</span></span> (1997), Frank P. later submitted into evidence a chart from which the jury could have determined that such a route would naturally have taken the GINA outside of a 100-mile limit between Cape Hatteras and Maine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Frank P. further testified as to past practice in his dealings with Charter Lakes. He claimed that in the past, navigational limits for the APHRODITE had been cited in Charter Lakes' quote letter, and that the written binder issued thereafter had cited those same limits, which in turn were cited in the formally issued policy. Frank P. testified that during his negotiations with VanEpps, no navigational limit was mentioned by VanEpps as to the trip from Florida to Maine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In granting judgment for defendants as a matter of law, the district judge took the view that, under general law applicable to insurance, a temporary binder provides only that coverage that is common practice in the industry and that it was Frank P.'s obligation&#8212;as the claimant under a binder contract&#8212;to establish that such insurance could be procured from St. Paul or others without a 100-mile limit. <i>Grande,</i> 365 F.Supp.2d at 63-64.

Rather, he testified that he also asked VanEpps for coverage for the trip from Florida to Maine and that he told VanEpps that the GINA would follow the most direct course (which a reasonable jury might find&#8212;based on the chart submitted into evidence&#8212;would take her more than 100 miles offshore).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"common practice\" rule does not apply if a \"special agreement\" has been made in the course of contracting. <i>Acadia Ins.

Thus, when VanEpps said that insurance was in force, a jury could find (although not obliged to do so) that the parties were agreeing that the insurance was in force for the trip as described by Frank P. to VanEpps.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants might say that the conversations were different or urge different inferences, but these would be typical jury issues. If the facts are resolved in Frank P.'s favor, we think that a contract&#8212;narrowed to an initial understanding that coverage would include the trip unconstrained by a 100-mile limit&#8212;might reasonably be inferred by a jury. How matters would stand at the end of the defense case, if contrary evidence were offered, is not something we need to anticipate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two other objections were found by the district court to preclude recovery. The first was what the district judge described as Frank P.'s failure to offer proof of causation running from the alleged wrong to actual harm. The district judge said that Frank P. had failed to show that insurance providing the coverage sought by Frank P.&#8212;<i>i.e.,</i> for a trip outside the 100-mile limit&#8212;would have been available either from St. Paul or anyone else. <i>Grande,</i> 365 F.Supp.2d at 63-64.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is some precedent, including one case from a Maine superior court, that is hostile to claims for a negligent failure to procure insurance, or even an alleged breach of a promise to procure insurance, where it turns out that the sought insurance was not in fact available.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> This may make some sense where, as commonly appears to be so in these cases, there was no reliance on the broker's representation. This is about the best sense we can make of this case law when the facts of the cases are examined.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Frank P.'s contract claim does not rest on a promise by the broker to seek to procure insurance&#8212;it is a claim that the broker, seemingly with apparent authority, provided insurance coverage for breach of which (one would expect) ordinary expectation damages are available. And, just to wrap matters up, even a negligence claim would on the present facts arguably rest on actual reliance (given Frank P.'s testimony that he would not have traveled outside of the 100-mile navigational limit had he known that such a limit attached). Thus, the causation objection is not enough to justify the directed verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's other objection was that Frank P.'s written application for the insurance was materially false because it represented him as the GINA's \"registered owner\" and did not disclose Frank A.'s interest anywhere on the application. 365 F.Supp.2d at 64-67. The district court said that under Maine law, \"[a]n insured must disclose in an application for insurance all known circumstances that materially affect the insurer's risks,\" <i>id.</i> at 65, adding that the doctrine is especially stringent under general maritime law where marine insurance policies are \"traditionally contracts <i>uberrimae fidei.\" Id.</i> (quoting <i>Windsor Mount Joy Mut. Ins. Co. v. Giragosian,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196149\"><a href=\"/opinion/196149/windsor-v-giragosian/\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 54 (1st Cir.1995)). \"<i>Uberrimae fidei</i>\" roughly translates as \"of the utmost good faith.\" <i>Black's Law Dictionary</i> 1558 (8th ed.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regardless of whether the stricter maritime doctrine applies (as opposed to Maine law), we find that a jury issue is presented. In the application that Frank P. faxed to VanEpps, the entry for \"registered owner(s) or [l]essee(s)\" was answered with Frank P.'s name and address. It may be debatable whether Frank P. was the \"owner\"; on the one hand, his cousin, Frank A., paid for the vessel and the bill of sale was made out to Frank A. On the other hand, Frank P. testified that it was understood between the two cousins that Frank P. then became the owner of the boat, subject to an obligation to repay the purchase price in due course.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If Frank P.'s testimony is credited, then he might be regarded as \"the owner\" in the legal sense (given the intention of the cousins as to ownership) and in the economic sense (if, as appears to have been the case, Frank P. bore the risk of loss in the event that the boat sank uninsured). Again, the defendants could contest the facts and the inferences, but it is hard to see how a verdict on the contrary premise could be directed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admittedly, Frank P. was apparently not the \"registered owner\" when the application was submitted. This phrase refers to a filing with an official registry for vessels, such as is afforded by individual states or by the Coast Guard. Frank P. said that his plan was to register the vessel in his name when he got to Maine. It is unclear that any such filing was ever made in Frank A.'s name. Based on Frank P.'s testimony, a jury could reasonably find him to be the \"owner,\" but not the \"registered owner,\" of the vessel at the time it sailed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Absent a different regime imposed by statute, an insurance contract is ordinarily voidable if a false statement in the application was \"material\"&#8212;materiality meaning something that affects the risk and might lead either to a higher premium or a refusal of insurance. There are various formulations: one treatise says that in the marine insurance context, a material fact is \"that which can possibly influence the mind of a prudent and intelligent insurer in determining whether it will accept the risk.\" 4A Appleman &amp; Appleman, <i>Insurance Law and Practice</i> &#167; 2651 (rev. ed.

Ins. Co. v. Polaris Pictures Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"758778\"><a href=\"/opinion/758778/cigna-property-and-casualty-insurance-company-cigna-group-of-companies/\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">412</span></a></span>, 420 (9th Cir.1998), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">815</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></span> (1999); among other things, the owner is the main party with an insurable interest, and the owner ordinarily has the primary incentive to safeguard the property (which reduces the risk). But if Frank P.'s testimony is accepted, he arguably was the owner in both senses. The district court seemed to think that Frank A. was the real owner, but given Frank P.'s testimony, this is a matter for the jury; indeed, it appears quite possible that Frank A. was not the owner when the insurance was sought.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It might still be \"material\" that the application inaccurately described Frank P. as the <i>registered</i> owner, but why is not so evident as to justify judgment as a matter of law. Neither the district court nor St. Paul's brief explains why registration is significant to the risk. There may well be a reason that St. Paul can adduce at trial. But, for now, it is an open question why the insurer would care whether Frank P., if the real owner, completed the registration before or after he arrived in Maine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge seemed to say that, in any event, it was material that Frank A. had purchased the boat in the first instance, transferred it orally, but had not yet been paid. It is not clear that any question in the application called for a disclosure of such facts; for example, if Frank P. had purchased the vessel from the manufacturer with no money down and then registered it in his name, nothing in the application seemed to call for this to be disclosed. Under ordinary contract law, false statements can undermine contracts, but an affirmative duty to disclose is not universal. 1 <i>Farnsworth on Contracts</i> &#167; 3.26c(3), at 409-10 (3d ed.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, under the strict maritime rule of <i>uberrimae fidei,</i> an insured must make \"full disclosure of all material facts of which the insured has, or ought to have, knowledge ... even though no inquiry be made.\" 7 Russ &amp; Segalla, <i>Couch on Insurance</i> &#167; 99:2 (3d ed.1997) (footnote omitted); <i>see also HIH Marine Servs. v. Fraser,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1359</span></span>, 1362 (11th Cir.2000); <i>Cigna,</i> 159 F.3d at 420. This doctrine apparently rests on the special circumstances of maritime insurance in which the insurer may have less than ordinary opportunities to inspect and verify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet even if the maritime rule applies&#8212;whether Maine law would apply the same approach anyway has not been briefed&#8212;judgment as a matter of law was not justified here. Frank A. testified that he never intended to possess or operate the vessel, and Frank P. said that he owned the vessel, owing Frank A. the purchase price. It is not clear why this arrangement would affect the insurer's risk assessment (although reasons might be adduced during the defendants' case at trial).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore conclude that as to Frank P.'s contract claim against St. Paul, judgment as a matter of law should not have been granted. This brings us to the negligence and estoppel claims. Frank P. argues that such claims would survive even if the contract claim fell; the district judge treated both non-contract theories as more or less variations on the same theme as the contract claim, and, after disposing of the contract claim, found that the other two followed suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In principle, the contract, negligence, and estoppel claims are not identical as to elements or even parties. For example, while there is normally no liability of the agent for the principal's breach of contract, an agent may sometimes be liable in negligence to one with whom he deals, <i>County Forest Prods.,</i> 758 A.2d at 69-70, while the principal may or may not be liable; and obviously whether one made and breached a contract or acted negligently in breach of a duty of care are two different questions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court ruled that the same considerations that it deemed to bar the contract claim&#8212;the disclosure flaws and lack of causation&#8212;also barred the alternative claims. Because we disagree with the premise as applied to the contract claim, no lengthy discussion of its extension to the other two claims is needed; they too must be remanded for further proceedings. However, we caution against too ready an assumption that the answers or defenses that work against one claim necessarily work against all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is <i>vacated</i> and the matter <i>remanded</i> for further proceedings consistent with this decision.
