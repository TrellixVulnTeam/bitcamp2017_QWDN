Plaintiffs  Karl and  Diane\n                                  \n\nPihl  filed  this  lawsuit  in  1987,  alleging  that  defendants\n\nMassachusetts Department of  Education, Lowell School  Committee,\n\nCity  of Lowell and Lowell Special Education Administrator George\n\nTsandikos  denied educational  services due  Karl  as a  disabled\n\nchild.   They now appeal  from a district court  order dismissing\n\ntheir complaint  for failure to  state a claim upon  which relief\n\ncould be granted,  presumably because moot, since  the challenged\n\neducational  plan had  expired four years  earlier, and  Karl had\n\nsince passed the  age of entitlement for services.   We conclude,\n\nafter  review of  the  authorities,  that  the  Individuals  with\n\nDisabilities Education  Act (IDEA)1  empowers courts  to grant  a\n\nremedy in the form of compensatory education to disabled students\n\nwho  are beyond  the  statutory age  of  entitlement for  special\n\neducation services, and that  Karl Pihl has alleged  facts which,\n\nif proven, state  a claim for relief.   We therefore reverse  the\n\ndistrict   court's   decision   to  dismiss,   and   remand   for\n\ndetermination of the merits of his claim.\n\n                     I.  Factual Background2\n                                           \n\n                    \n\n1The IDEA was formerly known  as the Education of the Handicapped\nAct (EHA).  See Pub. L. 102-119,   25(b), Oct. 7, 1991, 105 Stat.\n               \n607 (substituting \"Individuals  with Disabilities Education  Act\"\nfor \"Education  of the Handicapped  Act\").  Except  when reciting\nthe history of the  case, or when quoting decisions which cite to\nthe EHA, the  parties cite to  the IDEA in  their briefs, and  we\njoin them in doing so.\n\n2These  facts  are  drawn from  the  three  volume Administrative\nRecord filed by the parties in the district court on September 9,\n1987, and the pleadings filed in this case. \n\n                               -2-\n\n     Plaintiff  Karl Pihl is  a twenty-seven-year-old man  who is\n\nemotionally disturbed and retarded, and who suffers from profound\n\nhearing  loss  and  speech deficiencies.    Karl  began receiving\n\nspecial education  services at  the age of  four, and  attended a\n\nnumber of  different programs over  the years.  The  local school\n\nsystem was  obligated by state  and federal law to  provide these\n\nservices to  him.  See infra at 7.   During the 1983 school year,\n                            \n\nKarl participated in a residential/educational program for multi-\n\nhandicapped deaf students  at the Perkins  School for the  Blind,\n\nbut was terminated due to aggressive  behavior.  He was placed at\n\nthe  Lighthouse School,  a  private day  facility, on  an interim\n\nbasis, until an  appropriate residential program could  be found.\n\nIn June 1985, dissatisfied with the educational services Karl was\n\nreceiving at the  Lighthouse School, Karl's mother  Diane removed\n\nhim from  school and  kept him  at home,  under the  care of  two\n\ntwenty-four  hour attendants.   While the Pihls  paid for twenty-\n\nfour hour  care, the  school system held  his place  open at  the\n\nLighthouse  School,  continuing  to  search  for  an  appropriate\n\nprogram, or ways  to adapt the Lighthouse School  program to meet\n\nKarl's needs.\n\n     In 1986, when Karl was  nineteen, his mother requested a due\n\nprocess hearing  before the  Board of  Special Education  Appeals\n\n(BSEA)  to review  her  claim  that Karl  was  not receiving  the\n\neducational services to which he  was entitled by law.  Following\n\nthe  hearing, held  on July 15,  1986, Mrs.  Pihl and  the Lowell\n\nPublic  Schools  signed  a consent  decree  requiring  the school\n\n                               -3-\n\ndistrict to provide interim services to Karl while an appropriate\n\nresidential placement was sought.3  The interim agreement  was to\n\nend on November  30, 1986, or earlier,  if Karl were placed  in a\n\nresidential  program acceptable to  his parent,  or ordered  by a\n\nhearing officer, or  if the agreement was terminated  by order of\n\nthe  hearing  officer.    The  hearing   officer  was  to  retain\n\njurisdiction, and the  hearing would reconvene if Lowell  had not\n\npresented  a program willing  to accept Karl  by that  date.  The\n\nhearing  also would  reconvene at either  party's request,  or if\n\nDiane Pihl were to reject a proposed program.\n\n     On  January  28,   1987,  the  hearing  was   reconvened  on\n\nplaintiffs' motion, and the Massachusetts Department of Education\n\n(DOE) was joined as a party.  Plaintiffs sought an order  that an\n\nappropriate  program be  created for  Karl,  because no  existing\n\nappropriate educational facility  had been  found for  him.   The\n\nBSEA issued an  order the next day, January  29, requiring Lowell\n\nto create a  home-based program.  The hearing  officer also noted\n\nan agreement by  the parties that Mrs. Pihl  would receive monies\n\ndue her from Lowell as a result of payments made pursuant  to the\n\nconsent  decree.   The  BSEA deferred  decision  on five  issues,\n\nincluding: whether  service  delivery  pursuant  to  the  consent\n\ndecree should  be adjudicated  inadequate and inappropriate;  and\n\n                    \n\n3 The consent decree specifically  stated that Mrs. Pihl did not,\nby  this  agreement,  admit that  the  interim  services provided\npursuant to  the decree  were sufficient  or adequate  to fulfill\nLowell Public Schools' obligations under state and federal law.\n\n                               -4-\n\nwhether Karl was entitled to  compensatory services for two years\n\nfollowing his 22nd birthday.  \n\n     Two  weeks later,  the school  district filed  a  motion for\n\nreconsideration,  indicating  that  it  had found  a  residential\n\nplacement for Karl  at the Brown  School in  Austin, Texas.   The\n\nsame day, the  plaintiffs filed this  lawsuit, seeking to  compel\n\nthe  defendants to provide Karl with an appropriate education, in\n\naccordance with the BSEA's January 29 decision.  The BSEA granted\n\nthe  motion  for  reconsideration,  and,  following  a  five  day\n\nhearing, ruled  that the  program proposed  by defendants  was an\n\nappropriate placement for Karl, and ordered Lowell to  prepare an\n\nindividualized educational program (IEP) for Karl reflecting this\n\nplacement.4  \n\n     On  May  11,  1987, plaintiffs  filed  an  amended complaint\n\nalleging causes of action under the  Education of the Handicapped\n\nAct (EHA),  20 U.S.C.     1401-1415, and  parallel provisions  of\n\nMassachusetts law, Mass. Gen. L. Ch. 71B.  They claimed that Karl\n\nhad never been provided with  an appropriate IEP; that except for\n\n                    \n\n4 The IEP is a comprehensive written statement, developed jointly\nby  the  child's   parents,  the  school  district,   and,  where\nappropriate,  the  child,  which  outlines  the  child's  special\neducational  needs,  and the  specially designed  instruction and\nservices to be provided by the school system to meet those needs.\n20 U.S.C.   1401 (a)(20); 34 C.F.R.    300.340, 300.344, 300.346;\n603 Code  Mass. Regs.     28.314.0,  28.322.0.  The  IEP must  be\nreviewed, and, where appropriate, revised,  at least once a year,\nin order to  ensure that  local agencies  tailor the  statutorily\nrequired  \"free  appropriate education\"  to  each child's  unique\nneeds.   Honig v.  Doe, 484 U.S.  305, 311  (1988); 20  U.S.C.   \n                      \n1413(a)(1,11), 1414(a)(5); 34 C.F.R.   300.343; Mass. Gen. L. Ch.\n71B,   3.\n\n                               -5-\n\na  few  weeks of  intermittent  tutorial  services, he  had  been\n\nwithout an  IEP, or  any education whatsoever,  for at  least two\n\nyears; and that  the Brown School placement was inappropriate and\n\nin violation of state law, because of its great distance from the\n\nPihls' home,  its  restrictive (hospital-based)  nature, and  the\n\nfact  that it  was not  approved  by Massachusetts  or Texas  for\n\neducation  of the  deaf, due  to the  lack of  properly certified\n\npersonnel.   Plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction requiring\n\nLowell  to  maintain  interim services  until  resolution  of the\n\ndispute;  an injunction against  the Brown School  placement that\n\nwould  require the defendants to provide an appropriate education\n\nin the least restrictive setting as close as possible to home; an\n\ninjunction requiring compensatory education; an order for payment\n\nof  out-of-pocket  educational, legal,  and  expert expenses  and\n\ncosts; and all other forms of relief that the court deemed just.\n\n     On  May 18, 1987,  the district court  dismissed plaintiffs'\n\nsection 1983 claim, since plaintiffs' exclusive avenue for appeal\n\nand relief was provided  by the IDEA.   Nearly six years  later,5\n\non   March  9,  1993,   another  district  court   judge  allowed\n\ndefendants' second  motion to  dismiss.  In  a margin  order, the\n\ncourt  stated that plaintiffs had  failed to show \"entitlement to\n\nany relief this court could  properly grant.\"  The district court\n\ndid not elaborate on the reasons for its decision.  It apparently\n\n                    \n\n5The case was initially set for trial on  September 28, 1987, but\nwas  postponed  due  to the  withdrawal  of  plaintiffs' counsel.\nExcept  for two  pro se  motions made by  plaintiffs in  1987 and\n1988, no  further action  was taken on  this case  until November\n1991, when a magistrate judge convened a status conference.\n\n                               -6-\n\nadopted,  however,  the  defendants'  position  that  plaintiffs'\n\ncomplaint was  moot because the  challenged IEP had  expired four\n\nyears earlier, and because Karl was beyond the age of entitlement\n\nfor special educational services under the IDEA.6\n\n     On  this appeal,  plaintiffs address  only  their claim  for\n\ncompensatory  education.  They contend that, if Karl demonstrates\n\nthat  defendants   failed  to   provide   him  with   appropriate\n\neducational  services during  the challenged  period,  he is  now\n\nentitled  to  compensatory  services,   regardless  of  his  age.\n\nAlthough they  acknowledge that the  BSEA has not  rendered final\n\ndecisions on the appropriateness of services provided during some\n\nof the contested  period, they argue that they  should be excused\n\nfrom  the usual exhaustion  requirement.  Defendants  continue to\n\nargue that this case is  moot, because the challenged IEP expired\n\nover  five years  ago, and  because  Karl is  beyond  the age  of\n\nentitlement for services under the Act.  \n\n     When evaluating a motion to  dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), we\n\ntake the  well-pleaded facts  as  they appear  in the  complaint,\n\nextending plaintiff  every  reasonable inference  in  his  favor.\n\nCoyne  v. City  of Somerville,  972  F.2d 440,  442-43 (1st  Cir.\n                             \n\n1992).  We begin with a review of the statutory backdrop.\n\n                         II.  Discussion\n                                        \n\n     A.   Statutory Framework\n                             \n\n                    \n\n6The  court  apparently  gave some  significance  to  the earlier\ndismissal, noting that \"defendants' earlier motion to dismiss . .\n.  was previously  allowed  on  May 18,  1987.\"   That  decision,\nhowever, had dismissed only the section 1983 claims.  \n\n                               -7-\n\n     The  IDEA requires  states,  as  a  condition  of  accepting\n\nfederal  financial  assistance,  to ensure  a  \"free  appropriate\n\npublic  education\" to all children  with disabilities.  20 U.S.C.\n\n    1400(c), 1412(1).   In Massachusetts, in  accordance with the\n\nstate's  responsibility under the  Act, disabled  children remain\n\neligible for special education services  up to the age of twenty-\n\ntwo, provided they have not yet attained a high school diploma or\n\nits equivalent.  Mass. Gen. Laws Ch. 71B,    1, 3. \n\n     The  Act  imposes   extensive  procedural  requirements   on\n\nparticipating  state and local  agencies to safeguard  a disabled\n\nstudent's  right to  a  free appropriate  public  education.   20\n\nU.S.C.      1401(a)(20);   1412(2,4,5,7);  1415(a,b);  Board   of\n                                                                 \n\nEducation of Hendrick  Hudson Central School District  v.

In\n\nMassachusetts, this  function is  performed by the  BSEA.   Mass.\n\nGen. L. ch. 15,    1M (West Supp. 1993).

We next  discuss the\n\navailability of this type  of relief following the  statutory age\n\nof entitlement.\n\n     B.   Availability of compensatory education under the Act\n                                                              \n\n     In this case, the Pihls  claim that there was no appropriate\n\nIEP for substantial periods of time, beginning from a time before\n\nKarl's removal  from the  Lighthouse School in  June 1985.   They\n\ncontend  that the Supreme  Court's decision in  Burlington School\n                                                                 \n\nCommittee v. Mass. Dept. of  Ed., 471 U.S. 359 (1984) establishes\n                                \n\nthat a student who  fails to receive appropriate services  during\n\nany  time  in which  he  is  entitled  to  them  may  be  awarded\n\ncompensation in the form of  additional services at a later time.\n\nPlaintiffs claim  that Karl lacked  an appropriate IEP,  and thus\n\nadequate educational services,  beginning with the period  before\n\nhis removal from  the Lighthouse School in 1985,  and through his\n\nlast school  year of eligibility  in 1987-1988.  They  claim that\n\neven though he  is beyond the statutory age  of entitlement, Karl\n\nis still  entitled to future  services to make up  for the school\n\ndistrict's failure to provide adequate services in the past.7\n\n                    \n\n7Defendants devote most of their  brief to arguing that this case\nis moot, invoking cases suggesting that review is unavailable for\nan expired IEP, except in special circumstances, such as when the\ndispute  over the  development  and/or rejection  of  the IEP  is\nlikely to be  repeated in the same form  in the future.   None of\n\n                               -9-\n\n     In Burlington, the Supreme Court held that courts' authority\n                  \n\nto grant relief under the Act \"includes the power to order school\n\nauthorities  to  reimburse  parents  for  their  expenditures  on\n\nprivate school  education  for a  child if  the court  ultimately\n\ndetermines that  such placement, rather  than a proposed  IEP, is\n\nproper under the Act.\"  471 U.S.  at 369.  In the context of  the\n\ncomprehensive, and often  time-consuming, review process afforded\n\nby  the IDEA, this  type of equitable relief  helps to secure the\n\nchild's right to a free  appropriate public education, as well as\n                       \n\nthe parents' right to meaningful participation in the development\n\nof a proper  IEP, in accordance with the  congressional intent to\n\nprovide  relief that remedies deprivations  of these rights.

In awarding compensatory education  past the age of\nentitlement,  courts have  directed  the  parties  to  take  into\naccount the student's  educational status and  needs at the  time\nthe  relief takes  effect.   See Straube,  801 F. Supp.  at 1181;\n                                        \nPuffer v. Raynolds, 761 F. Supp. 838, 853 (D.

Each of the other circuits adopting this view has\n             \n\nexplained its ruling in a similar fashion.  \n\n     Although  the First Circuit has not ruled explicitly whether\n\ncompensatory  education is  available  under  the  Act,  we  have\n\nassumed that  it is.   See Murphy  v. Timberlane  Regional School\n                                                                 \n\nDist.,  973  F.2d   13,  16  (1st   Cir.  1992)  (citing   cases)\n     \n\n(recognizing that \"every  circuit which has addressed  this issue\n\nsince .  .  .

With the  issue now\n\nsquarely  before  us, we  have  no  difficulty in  joining  those\n\ncircuits  that  have  decided  that   compensatory  education  is\n\navailable  to  remedy   past  deprivations.    For   the  reasons\n\narticulated  by those courts,  and noted above,  we are persuaded\n\nthat Burlington  anticipates  the  availability  of  compensatory\n               \n\neducation  under the  IDEA.    We  therefore  reject  defendants'\n\nsuggestion that  this case  is moot simply  because the  time for\n\nmodifying the challenged  IEPs has passed.  If an IEP from a past\n\nyear is found to be deficient, the  Act may require services at a\n\nfuture time to compensate for what was lost. \n\n     C.

They rely on  Honig, 484\n                                                            \n\nU.S.  at  318, in  which  the  Supreme Court  held  that an  IDEA\n\n                               -12-\n\nchallenge  to  a  policy  allowing  indefinite  suspension  of  a\n\ndisabled student for violent and disruptive conduct stemming from\n\nhis disabilities was moot as to Doe, a 24-year-old man,  since he\n\nwas \"no  longer entitled to  the protections and benefits  of the\n\n[IDEA], which limits eligibility to disabled children between the\n\nages of 3 and 21.\"   Because the Act did not cover him, the Court\n\nheld, there  was no  reasonable likelihood that  Doe again  would\n\nsuffer  the  challenged harm.    He  therefore  had no  right  to\n\ninjunctive relief against such suspensions.  Id.   \n                                                \n\n     Defendants maintain that, like Doe,  Karl Pihl is beyond the\n\nage of entitlement and thus  is ineligible for services under the\n\nIDEA.  And, like  Doe, they claim, Pihl does not  fall within the\n\nexception to the mootness doctrine  for conduct that is  \"capable\n\nof repetition, yet evading review,\" see Honig, 484 U.S. at 318-23\n                                             \n\n(discussing \"capable of repetition, yet evading review\" exception\n\nto mootness),  as  he  ceased  to  be  eligible  for  educational\n\nservices under the IDEA in 1988,  when he turned 22.  Lowell  has\n\nnot since been, nor  ever will be again, required to negotiate an\n\nIEP for Karl.\n\n     We  find  Honig  inapplicable to  a  claim  for compensatory\n                    \n\neducation.    The  Act  requires  a  state  to  provide  a  \"free\n\nappropriate  education\"  to  every disabled  child,  and empowers\n\ndistrict  courts to provide  a remedy for  individual handicapped\n\nchildren who are  deprived of that right.  20  U.S.C.    1400(c),\n\n1412(1),  1415(e).  The crucial difference between Honig and this\n                                                        \n\ncase is the  nature of the relief  requested.  In Honig,  Doe was\n                                                       \n\n                               -13-\n\nasking the  court to make the school district comply with the Act\n\nin  the  future.    But,  because  Doe  was  beyond  the  age  of\n\nentitlement  for services,  he had  no right  to demand  that the\n\nschool district  comply with the  Act either presently or  in the\n\nfuture.  By  contrast, Karl Pihl  is asking  only that the  court\n\ncompensate  him  for rights  that he  claims the  school district\n\ndenied him in the past.  See Lester H., 916 at F.2d at 872.\n                                      \n\n     This past term, the Supreme Court implicitly recognized this\n\ndistinction in Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School District, 113\n                                                            \n\nS. Ct. 2464, 246?, n.3 (1993).  In Zobrest, the Court  found that\n                                          \n\na student's claim  under  the IDEA for reimbursement for services\n\npresented  a live controversy,  notwithstanding the fact  that he\n\nhad graduated  from  high school,  and  therefore was  no  longer\n\neligible  for services  under the  Act.   Even before  Zobrest, a\n                                                              \n\nnumber of circuits  had held that a  student who was  deprived of\n\nservices to which he was entitled under the IDEA has a right to a\n\nremedy, in the form of  compensatory education, regardless of his\n\neligibility for  current or future  services under the Act.   See\n                                                                 \n\nBurr,  863 F.2d at  1078; Lester H.,  916 F.2d  at 873; Jefferson\n                                                                 \n\nCounty Bd. of Ed., 853 F.2d at 857.  \n                 \n\n     Common sense commands  such a conclusion.  In  order to give\n\nmeaning to a disabled student's right to an education between the\n\nages  of three  and twenty-one,  compensatory  education must  be\n\navailable beyond  a student's twenty-first birthday.   Otherwise,\n\nschool districts simply could stop providing required services to\n\nolder  teenagers,  relying  on  the  Act's time-consuming  review\n\n                               -14-\n\nprocess  to  protect  them from  further  obligations.   Although\n\nstudents  able to  front  the costs  of an  appropriate education\n\nlater  could claim  reimbursement under  Burlington and  Zobrest,\n                                                                \n\nabsent  a compensatory education award, courts would be powerless\n\nto aid  intended beneficiaries who  were over twenty-one  but who\n\nhad  not  sought out  an  alternative educational  program.   See\n                                                                 \n\nLester H., 916  F.2d at 872; Burr, 863  F.2d at 1078.   We cannot\n                                 \n\nbelieve that Congress, in establishing a disabled student's right\n\nto public education, would allow a school district to suspend the\n\neducational rights  of such disabled eighteen-  or nineteen-year-\n\nolds without  a remedy.   See  id.   In addition,  as the  Eighth\n                                  \n\nCircuit has  noted,  compensatory education  is  consistent  with\n\nCongress' intent to channel available resources to activities and\n\nprograms that benefit disabled students.  See Miener, 800 F.2d at\n                                                    \n\n753,  citing  Smith  v.

Rec. 19501 (1975).\n       \n\n     Thus, if Karl Pihl can prove that the school district denied\n\nhim his right  to an appropriate education under  the IDEA during\n\nthe  challenged period,  he could  claim  relief in  the form  of\n\ncompensatory education, notwithstanding  the fact that he  is now\n\ntwenty-seven years old.\n\n           III.

See David\n                                                                 \n\nD. v.

In its January 29, 1987 order,\n\nthe BSEA explicitly  deferred decision on five  specific matters,\n\nincluding  \"[w]hether service  delivery pursuant  to the  Consent\n\nDecree should be  adjudicated inadequate and inappropriate,\"  and\n\n\"[w]hether  Karl is  entitled to  compensatory  services for  two\n\nyears  following  his  22nd  birthday.\"    Therefore,  it is  not\n\nautomatically  barred  from consideration.    The BSEA,  however,\n\nnever made a final determination on the pre-1987 time period, and\n\nthe  rules regarding  exhaustion of  administrative remedies  may\n\nconstrain  the  district  court's   evaluation  of  the  services\n\nprovided during that time.\n\n                               -16-\n\n     While   parties  ordinarily   must  exhaust   administrative\n\nremedies  under the  IDEA  before  initiating  court  action,  in\n\ncertain cases, they may bypass the administrative process to seek\n\njudicial  relief.

During  the debate on the\nSenate Conference  Report, Senator Williams, the  Act's principal\nauthor, stated that \"exhaustion of the administrative  procedures\nestablished  under  this part  should  not  be  required for  any\nindividual  complainant filing a  judicial action in  cases where\nsuch exhaustion  would be futile  either as a legal  or practical\nmatter.\"   121 Cong.

Similarly, the House Report for the 1986 amendments\nrecited  permissible exceptions  to  the exhaustion  requirement,\nincluding where using administrative procedures would be  futile;\nwhere  an agency's  policy or  practice is  contrary to  law; and\nwhere it  is improbable that  adequate relief can be  obtained by\npursuing administrative remedies (e.g., the hearing officer lacks\nthe  authority to grant the  relief sought).

No. 296,\n99th Cong.,  1st Sess.  7 (1985), quoted  in Christopher  W., 877\n                                                            \nF.2d at 1094.\n\n                               -17-\n\nremedies  with respect  to the  issue  of compensatory  education\n\nprior to the Brown School placement is due to the BSEA's error or\n\nintransigence.  It  is not clear, however, that  the agency bears\n\nsole  responsibility for this  failure.  The  record does support\n\nplaintiffs' claim  that once the hearing officer had reserved the\n\nissue of Karl  Pihl's entitlement to compensatory  education, she\n\nnever returned to  it.  However, in evaluating  BSEA's failure to\n\naddress  this issue,  plaintiffs'  own  actions  should  also  be\n\nconsidered.  See, e.g., Plaintiffs' letter accompanying motion in\n                      \n\nopposition to  reconsideration, dated February 17,  1987 (waiving\n\nany determination  by the BSEA  at this time  regarding questions\n\nother  than those  relative to  Karl  Pihl's current  appropriate\n\neducational placement); see also supra at  6, n. 5.  Moreover, it\n                                      \n\nis open to question whether plaintiffs could have sought an order\n\nfrom the court  requiring the BSEA to convene in order to resolve\n\nthe issue  of plaintiffs'  entitlement to  compensatory education\n\nfor the earlier period.  See Ezratty, 648 F.2d at 777 n.7.\n                                    \n\n     We  believe  the  exhaustion  issue  is  more  appropriately\n\nresolved by the district court, which already will be considering\n\nthe 1987-1988 IEP.  We note, however, that our preliminary review\n\nsuggests  that   the  factual   record   regarding  Karl   Pihl's\n\neducational  placement during the  two years  prior to  the Brown\n\nSchool IEP is substantially developed, and the court may not need\n\nthe \"peculiar  expertise of  an administrative  hearing officer,\"\n\nsee Lester H.,  916 F.2d at 425,  to aid in its  determination of\n             \n\nthis claim.  Moreover, the  Act empowers courts sitting in review\n\n                               -18-\n\nof  administrative complaints  to supplement  the  hearing record\n\nwith additional evidence  at trial.

Plaintiffs  Karl and  Diane\n                                  \n\nPihl  filed  this  lawsuit  in  1987,  alleging  that  defendants\n\nMassachusetts Department of  Education, Lowell School  Committee,\n\nCity  of Lowell and Lowell Special Education Administrator George\n\nTsandikos  denied educational  services due  Karl  as a  disabled\n\nchild.   They now appeal  from a district court  order dismissing\n\ntheir complaint  for failure to  state a claim upon  which relief\n\ncould be granted,  presumably because moot, since  the challenged\n\neducational  plan had  expired four years  earlier, and  Karl had\n\nsince passed the  age of entitlement for services.   We conclude,\n\nafter  review of  the  authorities,  that  the  Individuals  with\n\nDisabilities Education  Act (IDEA)1  empowers courts  to grant  a\n\nremedy in the form of compensatory education to disabled students\n\nwho  are beyond  the  statutory age  of  entitlement for  special\n\neducation services, and that  Karl Pihl has alleged  facts which,\n\nif proven, state  a claim for relief.   We therefore reverse  the\n\ndistrict   court's   decision   to  dismiss,   and   remand   for\n\ndetermination of the merits of his claim.\n\n                     I.  Factual Background2\n                                           \n\n                    \n\n1The IDEA was formerly known  as the Education of the Handicapped\nAct (EHA).  See Pub. L. 102-119,   25(b), Oct. 7, 1991, 105 Stat.\n               \n607 (substituting \"Individuals  with Disabilities Education  Act\"\nfor \"Education  of the Handicapped  Act\").  Except  when reciting\nthe history of the  case, or when quoting decisions which cite to\nthe EHA, the  parties cite to  the IDEA in  their briefs, and  we\njoin them in doing so.\n\n2These  facts  are  drawn from  the  three  volume Administrative\nRecord filed by the parties in the district court on September 9,\n1987, and the pleadings filed in this case. \n\n                               -2-\n\n     Plaintiff  Karl Pihl is  a twenty-seven-year-old man  who is\n\nemotionally disturbed and retarded, and who suffers from profound\n\nhearing  loss  and  speech deficiencies.    Karl  began receiving\n\nspecial education  services at  the age of  four, and  attended a\n\nnumber of  different programs over  the years.  The  local school\n\nsystem was  obligated by state  and federal law to  provide these\n\nservices to  him.  See infra at 7.   During the 1983 school year,\n                            \n\nKarl participated in a residential/educational program for multi-\n\nhandicapped deaf students  at the Perkins  School for the  Blind,\n\nbut was terminated due to aggressive  behavior.  He was placed at\n\nthe  Lighthouse School,  a  private day  facility, on  an interim\n\nbasis, until an  appropriate residential program could  be found.\n\nIn June 1985, dissatisfied with the educational services Karl was\n\nreceiving at the  Lighthouse School, Karl's mother  Diane removed\n\nhim from  school and  kept him  at home,  under the  care of  two\n\ntwenty-four  hour attendants.   While the Pihls  paid for twenty-\n\nfour hour  care, the  school system held  his place  open at  the\n\nLighthouse  School,  continuing  to  search  for  an  appropriate\n\nprogram, or ways  to adapt the Lighthouse School  program to meet\n\nKarl's needs.\n\n     In 1986, when Karl was  nineteen, his mother requested a due\n\nprocess hearing  before the  Board of  Special Education  Appeals\n\n(BSEA)  to review  her  claim  that Karl  was  not receiving  the\n\neducational services to which he  was entitled by law.  Following\n\nthe  hearing, held  on July 15,  1986, Mrs.  Pihl and  the Lowell\n\nPublic  Schools  signed  a consent  decree  requiring  the school\n\n                               -3-\n\ndistrict to provide interim services to Karl while an appropriate\n\nresidential placement was sought.3  The interim agreement  was to\n\nend on November  30, 1986, or earlier,  if Karl were placed  in a\n\nresidential  program acceptable to  his parent,  or ordered  by a\n\nhearing officer, or  if the agreement was terminated  by order of\n\nthe  hearing  officer.    The  hearing   officer  was  to  retain\n\njurisdiction, and the  hearing would reconvene if Lowell  had not\n\npresented  a program willing  to accept Karl  by that  date.  The\n\nhearing  also would  reconvene at either  party's request,  or if\n\nDiane Pihl were to reject a proposed program.\n\n     On  January  28,   1987,  the  hearing  was   reconvened  on\n\nplaintiffs' motion, and the Massachusetts Department of Education\n\n(DOE) was joined as a party.  Plaintiffs sought an order  that an\n\nappropriate  program be  created for  Karl,  because no  existing\n\nappropriate educational facility  had been  found for  him.   The\n\nBSEA issued an  order the next day, January  29, requiring Lowell\n\nto create a  home-based program.  The hearing  officer also noted\n\nan agreement by  the parties that Mrs. Pihl  would receive monies\n\ndue her from Lowell as a result of payments made pursuant  to the\n\nconsent  decree.   The  BSEA deferred  decision  on five  issues,\n\nincluding: whether  service  delivery  pursuant  to  the  consent\n\ndecree should  be adjudicated  inadequate and inappropriate;  and\n\n                    \n\n3 The consent decree specifically  stated that Mrs. Pihl did not,\nby  this  agreement,  admit that  the  interim  services provided\npursuant to  the decree  were sufficient  or adequate  to fulfill\nLowell Public Schools' obligations under state and federal law.\n\n                               -4-\n\nwhether Karl was entitled to  compensatory services for two years\n\nfollowing his 22nd birthday.  \n\n     Two  weeks later,  the school  district filed  a  motion for\n\nreconsideration,  indicating  that  it  had found  a  residential\n\nplacement for Karl  at the Brown  School in  Austin, Texas.   The\n\nsame day, the  plaintiffs filed this  lawsuit, seeking to  compel\n\nthe  defendants to provide Karl with an appropriate education, in\n\naccordance with the BSEA's January 29 decision.  The BSEA granted\n\nthe  motion  for  reconsideration,  and,  following  a  five  day\n\nhearing, ruled  that the  program proposed  by defendants  was an\n\nappropriate placement for Karl, and ordered Lowell to  prepare an\n\nindividualized educational program (IEP) for Karl reflecting this\n\nplacement.4  \n\n     On  May  11,  1987, plaintiffs  filed  an  amended complaint\n\nalleging causes of action under the  Education of the Handicapped\n\nAct (EHA),  20 U.S.C.     1401-1415, and  parallel provisions  of\n\nMassachusetts law, Mass. Gen. L. Ch. 71B.  They claimed that Karl\n\nhad never been provided with  an appropriate IEP; that except for\n\n                    \n\n4 The IEP is a comprehensive written statement, developed jointly\nby  the  child's   parents,  the  school  district,   and,  where\nappropriate,  the  child,  which  outlines  the  child's  special\neducational  needs,  and the  specially designed  instruction and\nservices to be provided by the school system to meet those needs.\n20 U.S.C.   1401 (a)(20); 34 C.F.R.    300.340, 300.344, 300.346;\n603 Code  Mass. Regs.     28.314.0,  28.322.0.  The  IEP must  be\nreviewed, and, where appropriate, revised,  at least once a year,\nin order to  ensure that  local agencies  tailor the  statutorily\nrequired  \"free  appropriate education\"  to  each child's  unique\nneeds.

Plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction requiring\n\nLowell  to  maintain  interim services  until  resolution  of the\n\ndispute;  an injunction against  the Brown School  placement that\n\nwould  require the defendants to provide an appropriate education\n\nin the least restrictive setting as close as possible to home; an\n\ninjunction requiring compensatory education; an order for payment\n\nof  out-of-pocket  educational, legal,  and  expert expenses  and\n\ncosts; and all other forms of relief that the court deemed just.\n\n     On  May 18, 1987,  the district court  dismissed plaintiffs'\n\nsection 1983 claim, since plaintiffs' exclusive avenue for appeal\n\nand relief was provided  by the IDEA.   Nearly six years  later,5\n\non   March  9,  1993,   another  district  court   judge  allowed\n\ndefendants' second  motion to  dismiss.  In  a margin  order, the\n\ncourt  stated that plaintiffs had  failed to show \"entitlement to\n\nany relief this court could  properly grant.\"  The district court\n\ndid not elaborate on the reasons for its decision.  It apparently\n\n                    \n\n5The case was initially set for trial on  September 28, 1987, but\nwas  postponed  due  to the  withdrawal  of  plaintiffs' counsel.\nExcept  for two  pro se  motions made by  plaintiffs in  1987 and\n1988, no  further action  was taken on  this case  until November\n1991, when a magistrate judge convened a status conference.\n\n                               -6-\n\nadopted,  however,  the  defendants'  position  that  plaintiffs'\n\ncomplaint was  moot because the  challenged IEP had  expired four\n\nyears earlier, and because Karl was beyond the age of entitlement\n\nfor special educational services under the IDEA.6\n\n     On  this appeal,  plaintiffs address  only  their claim  for\n\ncompensatory  education.  They contend that, if Karl demonstrates\n\nthat  defendants   failed  to   provide   him  with   appropriate\n\neducational  services during  the challenged  period,  he is  now\n\nentitled  to  compensatory  services,   regardless  of  his  age.\n\nAlthough they  acknowledge that the  BSEA has not  rendered final\n\ndecisions on the appropriateness of services provided during some\n\nof the contested  period, they argue that they  should be excused\n\nfrom  the usual exhaustion  requirement.  Defendants  continue to\n\nargue that this case is  moot, because the challenged IEP expired\n\nover  five years  ago, and  because  Karl is  beyond  the age  of\n\nentitlement for services under the Act.  \n\n     When evaluating a motion to  dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), we\n\ntake the  well-pleaded facts  as  they appear  in the  complaint,\n\nextending plaintiff  every  reasonable inference  in  his  favor.\n\nCoyne  v.

With the  issue now\n\nsquarely  before  us, we  have  no  difficulty in  joining  those\n\ncircuits  that  have  decided  that   compensatory  education  is\n\navailable  to  remedy   past  deprivations.    For   the  reasons\n\narticulated  by those courts,  and noted above,  we are persuaded\n\nthat Burlington  anticipates  the  availability  of  compensatory\n               \n\neducation  under the  IDEA.    We  therefore  reject  defendants'\n\nsuggestion that  this case  is moot simply  because the  time for\n\nmodifying the challenged  IEPs has passed.  If an IEP from a past\n\nyear is found to be deficient, the  Act may require services at a\n\nfuture time to compensate for what was lost. \n\n     C.

They rely on  Honig, 484\n                                                            \n\nU.S.  at  318, in  which  the  Supreme Court  held  that an  IDEA\n\n                               -12-\n\nchallenge  to  a  policy  allowing  indefinite  suspension  of  a\n\ndisabled student for violent and disruptive conduct stemming from\n\nhis disabilities was moot as to Doe, a 24-year-old man,  since he\n\nwas \"no  longer entitled to  the protections and benefits  of the\n\n[IDEA], which limits eligibility to disabled children between the\n\nages of 3 and 21.\"   Because the Act did not cover him, the Court\n\nheld, there  was no  reasonable likelihood that  Doe again  would\n\nsuffer  the  challenged harm.    He  therefore  had no  right  to\n\ninjunctive relief against such suspensions.  Id.   \n                                                \n\n     Defendants maintain that, like Doe,  Karl Pihl is beyond the\n\nage of entitlement and thus  is ineligible for services under the\n\nIDEA.  And, like  Doe, they claim, Pihl does not  fall within the\n\nexception to the mootness doctrine  for conduct that is  \"capable\n\nof repetition, yet evading review,\" see Honig, 484 U.S. at 318-23\n                                             \n\n(discussing \"capable of repetition, yet evading review\" exception\n\nto mootness),  as  he  ceased  to  be  eligible  for  educational\n\nservices under the IDEA in 1988,  when he turned 22.  Lowell  has\n\nnot since been, nor  ever will be again, required to negotiate an\n\nIEP for Karl.\n\n     We  find  Honig  inapplicable to  a  claim  for compensatory\n                    \n\neducation.    The  Act  requires  a  state  to  provide  a  \"free\n\nappropriate  education\"  to  every disabled  child,  and empowers\n\ndistrict  courts to provide  a remedy for  individual handicapped\n\nchildren who are  deprived of that right.  20  U.S.C.    1400(c),\n\n1412(1),  1415(e).  The crucial difference between Honig and this\n                                                        \n\ncase is the  nature of the relief  requested.  In Honig,  Doe was\n                                                       \n\n                               -13-\n\nasking the  court to make the school district comply with the Act\n\nin  the  future.    But,  because  Doe  was  beyond  the  age  of\n\nentitlement  for services,  he had  no right  to demand  that the\n\nschool district  comply with the  Act either presently or  in the\n\nfuture.  By  contrast, Karl Pihl  is asking  only that the  court\n\ncompensate  him  for rights  that he  claims the  school district\n\ndenied him in the past.

Even before  Zobrest, a\n                                                              \n\nnumber of circuits  had held that a  student who was  deprived of\n\nservices to which he was entitled under the IDEA has a right to a\n\nremedy, in the form of  compensatory education, regardless of his\n\neligibility for  current or future  services under the Act.   See\n                                                                 \n\nBurr,  863 F.2d at  1078; Lester H.,  916 F.2d  at 873; Jefferson\n                                                                 \n\nCounty Bd. of Ed., 853 F.2d at 857.  \n                 \n\n     Common sense commands  such a conclusion.  In  order to give\n\nmeaning to a disabled student's right to an education between the\n\nages  of three  and twenty-one,  compensatory  education must  be\n\navailable beyond  a student's twenty-first birthday.   Otherwise,\n\nschool districts simply could stop providing required services to\n\nolder  teenagers,  relying  on  the  Act's time-consuming  review\n\n                               -14-\n\nprocess  to  protect  them from  further  obligations.   Although\n\nstudents  able to  front  the costs  of an  appropriate education\n\nlater  could claim  reimbursement under  Burlington and  Zobrest,\n                                                                \n\nabsent  a compensatory education award, courts would be powerless\n\nto aid  intended beneficiaries who  were over twenty-one  but who\n\nhad  not  sought out  an  alternative educational  program.   See\n                                                                 \n\nLester H., 916  F.2d at 872; Burr, 863  F.2d at 1078.   We cannot\n                                 \n\nbelieve that Congress, in establishing a disabled student's right\n\nto public education, would allow a school district to suspend the\n\neducational rights  of such disabled eighteen-  or nineteen-year-\n\nolds without  a remedy.

In addition,  as the  Eighth\n                                  \n\nCircuit has  noted,  compensatory education  is  consistent  with\n\nCongress' intent to channel available resources to activities and\n\nprograms that benefit disabled students.

In its January 29, 1987 order,\n\nthe BSEA explicitly  deferred decision on five  specific matters,\n\nincluding  \"[w]hether service  delivery pursuant  to the  Consent\n\nDecree should be  adjudicated inadequate and inappropriate,\"  and\n\n\"[w]hether  Karl is  entitled to  compensatory  services for  two\n\nyears  following  his  22nd  birthday.\"    Therefore,  it is  not\n\nautomatically  barred  from consideration.    The BSEA,  however,\n\nnever made a final determination on the pre-1987 time period, and\n\nthe  rules regarding  exhaustion of  administrative remedies  may\n\nconstrain  the  district  court's   evaluation  of  the  services\n\nprovided during that time.\n\n                               -16-\n\n     While   parties  ordinarily   must  exhaust   administrative\n\nremedies  under the  IDEA  before  initiating  court  action,  in\n\ncertain cases, they may bypass the administrative process to seek\n\njudicial  relief.

Exhaustion may not be required  where the pursuit of\n\nadministrative  remedies would  be  futile  or inadequate;  waste\n\nresources, and work  severe or irreparable harm  on the litigant;\n\nor when  the issues raised  involve purely legal questions.

During  the debate on the\nSenate Conference  Report, Senator Williams, the  Act's principal\nauthor, stated that \"exhaustion of the administrative  procedures\nestablished  under  this part  should  not  be  required for  any\nindividual  complainant filing a  judicial action in  cases where\nsuch exhaustion  would be futile  either as a legal  or practical\nmatter.\"   121 Cong.  Rec. 37416 (1975),  quoted in  Ezratty, 648\n                                                            \nF.2d at 774.  Similarly, the House Report for the 1986 amendments\nrecited  permissible exceptions  to  the exhaustion  requirement,\nincluding where using administrative procedures would be  futile;\nwhere  an agency's  policy or  practice is  contrary to  law; and\nwhere it  is improbable that  adequate relief can be  obtained by\npursuing administrative remedies (e.g., the hearing officer lacks\nthe  authority to grant the  relief sought).   H.R. Rep. No. 296,\n99th Cong.,  1st Sess.  7 (1985), quoted  in Christopher  W., 877\n                                                            \nF.2d at 1094.\n\n                               -17-\n\nremedies  with respect  to the  issue  of compensatory  education\n\nprior to the Brown School placement is due to the BSEA's error or\n\nintransigence.  It  is not clear, however, that  the agency bears\n\nsole  responsibility for this  failure.  The  record does support\n\nplaintiffs' claim  that once the hearing officer had reserved the\n\nissue of Karl  Pihl's entitlement to compensatory  education, she\n\nnever returned to  it.  However, in evaluating  BSEA's failure to\n\naddress  this issue,  plaintiffs'  own  actions  should  also  be\n\nconsidered.  See, e.g., Plaintiffs' letter accompanying motion in\n                      \n\nopposition to  reconsideration, dated February 17,  1987 (waiving\n\nany determination  by the BSEA  at this time  regarding questions\n\nother  than those  relative to  Karl  Pihl's current  appropriate\n\neducational placement); see also supra at  6, n. 5.  Moreover, it\n                                      \n\nis open to question whether plaintiffs could have sought an order\n\nfrom the court  requiring the BSEA to convene in order to resolve\n\nthe issue  of plaintiffs'  entitlement to  compensatory education\n\nfor the earlier period.  See Ezratty, 648 F.2d at 777 n.7.\n                                    \n\n     We  believe  the  exhaustion  issue  is  more  appropriately\n\nresolved by the district court, which already will be considering\n\nthe 1987-1988 IEP.  We note, however, that our preliminary review\n\nsuggests  that   the  factual   record   regarding  Karl   Pihl's\n\neducational  placement during the  two years  prior to  the Brown\n\nSchool IEP is substantially developed, and the court may not need\n\nthe \"peculiar  expertise of  an administrative  hearing officer,\"\n\nsee Lester H.,  916 F.2d at 425,  to aid in its  determination of\n             \n\nthis claim.
