Hirt, on brief for\nrespondent.\n\n\n\n\n                           September 19, 2008\n\n\n\n\n           *\n               Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f            DYK, Circuit Judge. Sovann Nou (“Nou”) petitions for\n\nreview of a final order of removal entered by the Board of\n\nImmigration   Appeals     (“BIA”),   dismissing    Nou’s    appeal     from   a\n\ndecision of the Immigration Judge.           The Immigration Judge (“IJ”)\n\ndenied Nou’s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and\n\nrelief under the Convention Against Torture. Because we agree that\n\nsubstantial evidence supports the BIA’s conclusion that Nou was not\n\ntargeted on account of one of the protected statutory grounds, and\n\nthat   he   did    not   establish   a     well-founded    fear   of    future\n\npersecution, we conclude that the BIA did not err in rejecting\n\nNou’s asylum claim and in denying Nou’s petition for judicial\n\nreview.\n\n                                     I.\n\n            Nou, a native and citizen of Cambodia, has been living in\n\nthe United States since September 2001. While in Cambodia, Nou was\n\nan active member of the Sam Rainsy Party, which is opposed to the\n\nruling party in Cambodia, the Cambodian People’s Party.                Nou was\n\nnot, however, a party official.       Nou worked in the Krakor District\n\nas a Fisheries Officer for the Wildlife Division of the Cambodian\n\ngovernment.       In that capacity, Nou was charged with enforcing\n\nCambodian fishing laws. Nou testified that in February 1998, while\n\nNou was working, he heard gunshots being fired at his government\n\nbuilding.    Nou and others fled, jumping from the building into an\n\nadjacent body of water. The next day, the police investigating the\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fincident learned from several of the local villagers that the\n\nshooters     were   a    group   of   soldiers    or   police    officers.      Nou\n\ntestified that he was later threatened by soldiers who wanted to\n\nfish using hand grenades in violation of Cambodian law.                         The\n\nsoldiers also tried to bribe Nou, but Nou declined to cooperate.\n\n             Nou testified that he sought and was granted relocation\n\nto the province of Siem Reab, where he was again confronted and\n\nthreatened by soldiers wanting to fish using grenades.                   In 2000,\n\nNou   took   part   in    arresting     and    detaining   a    group   of   twenty\n\nfisherman for fishing illegally using grenades and electric shock.\n\nSeveral members of the Cambodian People’s Party were among those\n\narrested.      After that incident, Nou claims that he received a\n\nthreat from an unidentified person that, if he did not cooperate,\n\nhe would be killed.        Nou transferred a second time to the province\n\nof Kampong Chanang.         Several months after Nou’s transfer, he and\n\nhis entire work group were told to stop working, and he was fired\n\nfrom his job.\n\n             Nou secured airline tickets to leave Cambodia.                  He and\n\nhis wife left through the Phnom Phen airport, using passports\n\nissued in their own names.            He left the country without incident.\n\n             In September 2001, Nou entered the United States as a\n\nnonimmigrant B-2 visitor, authorized to remain in this country for\n\na temporary period not past March 6, 2002.               On June 29, 2002, Nou\n\nfiled an application seeking asylum.                   On April 8, 2003, the\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fDepartment of Homeland Security charged Nou with removal as a\n\nnonimmigrant visitor who had remained in the country longer than\n\nauthorized.\n\n                In   the   removal    proceedings,     the    IJ   denied   Nou’s\n\napplication for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection\n\nunder the Convention against Torture, and ordered Nou’s removal\n\nfrom the United States to Cambodia.             In his oral opinion, the IJ\n\nfound that Nou’s testimony was not credible.                 The IJ also found\n\nthat, even if he were to find Nou’s account credible as to the\n\nincidents that Nou described, “any action which had been attempted\n\nagainst [Nou] was not because of his membership in the Sam Rainsy\n\nParty but because of his unwillingness to cooperate with the people\n\nof the Cambodian People’s Party.”             J.A. at 12.     Accordingly, Nou\n\ndid not establish that “a reasonable person in his circumstances\n\nwould fear persecution on account of a statutorily protected\n\nground.”   J.A. at 13.        The IJ held that Nou had not established\n\nthat he was the victim of past persecution or that he would suffer\n\nfuture persecution.          The IJ also concluded that Nou had not\n\nestablished that he would be likely to suffer torture if he was\n\nreturned   to    Cambodia,    as     required    by   the   Convention   Against\n\nTorture.\n\n           Nou appealed to the BIA.             The BIA assumed that Nou was\n\ncredible but agreed that his evidence did not establish that Nou\n\n“was targeted on account of the statutory grounds.”                  J.A. at 2.\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fThe BIA also concluded that Nou could not establish a well-founded\n\nfear of future persecution, given the ease with which he obtained\n\nhis passport and visa to enter the United States, and given the\n\nchanged political conditions in Cambodia.1       The BIA concluded that\n\nNou also had not established his claim for withholding of removal\n\nor his claim under the Convention Against Torture.               The BIA\n\ndismissed Nou’s appeal. Nou timely petitioned for review. We have\n\njurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).\n\n                                  II.\n\n          On review, petitioner challenges only the rejection of\n\nhis asylum claim.   While we review the decision of the BIA, where,\n\nas here, the BIA adopts portions of the IJ’s decision, we review\n\nthose adopted portions directly.      Ouk v. Keisler, 505 F.3d 63, 67\n\n(1st Cir. 2007).    In doing so, we review findings of fact for\n\nsubstantial evidence and questions of law de novo. Sok v. Mukasey,\n\n526 F.3d 48, 52-53 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n          An   applicant    seeking     asylum   bears   the   burden   of\n\nestablishing that he is a “refugee” as defined by 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1101(a)(42)(A). Diab v. Ashcroft, 397 F.3d 35, 39 (1st Cir. 2005);\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1).     To do so, the applicant “must show either\n\npast persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution.”\n\nAlbathani v. I.N.S., 318 F.3d 365, 373 (1st Cir. 2003); 8 C.F.R. §\n\n\n          1\n            The BIA determined as well that Nou had not established\nthat the actions against him constituted persecution. In light of\nour disposition, we need not reach this question.\n                                -5-\n\f208.13(b).   Proof of past persecution entitles an applicant to a\n\npresumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 208.13(b)(1); Diab, 397 F.3d at 39.         In addition, the regulation\n\nrequires that such past or future persecution must be “on account\n\nof race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social\n\ngroup, or political opinion.”      8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1); Albathani,\n\n318 F.3d at 373.\n\n           Nou’s central contention is that the evidence before the\n\nIJ   establishes   his   past   persecution    in   Cambodia.     This      past\n\npersecution, Nou argues, was either on account of his membership in\n\na particular social group--namely the Sam Rainsy political party--\n\nor because of his political opinion.\n\n           We conclude that substantial evidence supports the BIA’s\n\nfinding that Nou has not shown that he was targeted “on account of”\n\nany of the protected statutory grounds.                Nou claimed that he\n\nsuffered persecution based on his membership in the Sam Rainsy\n\nParty, a political party opposed to the controlling Cambodian\n\nPeople’s Party.     He testified that, in 2000, his uncle–-a Sam\n\nRainsy Party officer--was killed on his way to a Sam Rainsy Party\n\nmeeting.   He also claimed that both he and his wife, as active Sam\n\nRainsy   Party   members,   had   been    threatened    by   members   of    the\n\nCambodian People’s Party, and that he had been shot at and lost his\n\njob in the Wildlife Division based on his party affiliation.                When\n\npressed, however, Nou admitted that he had been threatened and shot\n\nat and fired from his position because he enforced the ban on\n                                    -6-\n\fillegal fishing, and that others who were not members of the Sam\n\nRainsy Party were also fired.        The BIA did not err in concluding\n\nthat the actions that Nou relies on were in response to Nou’s\n\nefforts to enforce the ban on illegal fishing rather than his Sam\n\nRainsy Party membership.\n\n            Nou also asserts that he established a well-founded fear\n\nof   future    persecution,   even    if    he   did   not    establish   past\n\npersecution.    The BIA rejected Nou’s claim, finding that the ease\n\nof Nou’s departure from Cambodia belied his claim that he ever\n\nfaced any real danger from the government, and that, moreover, the\n\npolitical conditions in Cambodia do not support Nou’s contention.\n\nFor example, the Board noted that the Sam Rainsy Party actually\n\nholds approximately 20% of the seats in the Cambodian national\n\nassembly.     See also Ly v. Mukasey, 524 F.3d 126, 132-33 (1st Cir.\n\n2008)   (discussing   changed   political        conditions    in   Cambodia).\n\nSubstantial evidence supports the BIA’s conclusion that Nou did not\n\nestablish a well-founded fear of future persecution.\n\n            We have considered Nou’s other contentions and find them\n\nto be without merit.\n\n                                     III.\n\n            Accordingly, the petition for judicial review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f",

In addition, the regulation\n\nrequires that such past or future persecution must be “on account\n\nof race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social\n\ngroup, or political opinion.”      8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1); Albathani,\n\n318 F.3d at 373.\n\n           Nou’s central contention is that the evidence before the\n\nIJ   establishes   his   past   persecution    in   Cambodia.     This      past\n\npersecution, Nou argues, was either on account of his membership in\n\na particular social group--namely the Sam Rainsy political party--\n\nor because of his political opinion.\n\n           We conclude that substantial evidence supports the BIA’s\n\nfinding that Nou has not shown that he was targeted “on account of”\n\nany of the protected statutory grounds.                Nou claimed that he\n\nsuffered persecution based on his membership in the Sam Rainsy\n\nParty, a political party opposed to the controlling Cambodian\n\nPeople’s Party.     He testified that, in 2000, his uncle–-a Sam\n\nRainsy Party officer--was killed on his way to a Sam Rainsy Party\n\nmeeting.   He also claimed that both he and his wife, as active Sam\n\nRainsy   Party   members,   had   been    threatened    by   members   of    the\n\nCambodian People’s Party, and that he had been shot at and lost his\n\njob in the Wildlife Division based on his party affiliation.                When\n\npressed, however, Nou admitted that he had been threatened and shot\n\nat and fired from his position because he enforced the ban on\n                                    -6-\n\fillegal fishing, and that others who were not members of the Sam\n\nRainsy Party were also fired.        The BIA did not err in concluding\n\nthat the actions that Nou relies on were in response to Nou’s\n\nefforts to enforce the ban on illegal fishing rather than his Sam\n\nRainsy Party membership.\n\n            Nou also asserts that he established a well-founded fear\n\nof   future    persecution,   even    if    he   did   not    establish   past\n\npersecution.    The BIA rejected Nou’s claim, finding that the ease\n\nof Nou’s departure from Cambodia belied his claim that he ever\n\nfaced any real danger from the government, and that, moreover, the\n\npolitical conditions in Cambodia do not support Nou’s contention.\n\nFor example, the Board noted that the Sam Rainsy Party actually\n\nholds approximately 20% of the seats in the Cambodian national\n\nassembly.
