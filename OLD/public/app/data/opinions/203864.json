Katsas, Assistant Attorney General, was on   brief for\nrespondent.\n\n\n\n                          June 10, 2009\n\n\n\n\n     *\n          Pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 43(c)(2), Attorney General\nEric H. Holder, Jr. has been substituted for former Attorney\nGeneral Michael Mukasey as the respondent.\n\f            LYNCH, Chief Judge.         The sole question presented by this\n\npetition for review by Francine Pangemanan, of Indonesia, is\n\nwhether the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") erred in affirming\n\nthe finding of an immigration judge (\"IJ\") that Pangemanan had not\n\nestablished     her     claim    for   withholding          of   removal     after    she\n\noverstayed in this country. Because there was substantial evidence\n\nto    support   the     determination      that       she    had   not     shown     past\n\npersecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution, we deny\n\nthe petition.\n\n                                        I.\n\n            Pangemanan entered the United States on March 26, 2000 as\n\na non-immigrant visitor with authorization to remain no longer than\n\nsix months.       Her husband had come to the United States in 1997.\n\nShe   overstayed.        On     February   3,     2003,      the       Immigration    and\n\nNaturalization Service1 served Pangemanan with a Notice to Appear,\n\ncharging    her    as    removable     under      8    U.S.C.      §    1227(a)(1)(B).\n\nPangemanan filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal,\n\nand protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture\n\n(\"CAT\") on September 23, 2004.\n\n            Pangemanan's testimony before the IJ was that she is a\n\nChristian.      She actively participated in her church in Indonesia\n\n\n       1\n          On March 1, 2003, the INS ceased existing as an\nindependent agency, and many of its duties were transferred to U.S.\nCitizenship and Immigration Services, a subdivision of the\nDepartment of Homeland Security. Sharari v. Gonzales, 407 F.3d\n467, 469 n.2 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                                        -2-\n\ffrom 1972 until she came to the United States in 2000.      She and her\n\nhusband were never mistreated in Indonesia on account of their\n\nreligion.    Pangemanan's expressed fear of returning to Indonesia\n\nwas instead based upon the experiences of several family members.\n\n            Specifically, Pangemanan claimed that her father was\n\ndenied promotions within the military because he was a Christian.\n\nHer father died in 1990, and Pangemanan attributed his death, in\n\npart, to the stress he felt as an Indonesian Christian.\n\n            Pangemanan's mother had some difficulty obtaining her\n\nhusband’s pension following his death.      However, she continued to\n\nlive in Indonesia without incident until her death in 2006.\n\n            Pangemanan's brother was stabbed near a mosque in 1998 by\n\na Muslim youth.   Yet he continues to live in Indonesia and has not\n\nsubsequently   experienced   any   mistreatment   on   account   of   his\n\nreligion.\n\n            In 1999, a Christian school near the home of Pangemanan's\n\nsister burned down, causing her sister to move to another town in\n\nIndonesia.    She also still lives in Indonesia and has experienced\n\nno further problems.\n\n            Pangemanan has two daughters.   Her daughters attended a\n\nChristian school in Indonesia.     Although neither of her daughters\n\nwas harmed while living in Indonesia, Pangemanan testified that\n\nChristian students were the victims of violence in Indonesia.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fMoreover, the father of her younger daughter's friend was beheaded\n\nin 2000.\n\n           Pangemanan's husband testified that a Christian school\n\nfounded by his grandfather was burned in 2000.                His brother,\n\nhowever, continues to work as a police officer in the same town.\n\n           On July 20, 2006, the IJ rejected Pangemanan's asylum\n\napplication as untimely, and found the delay was not excused by\n\n\"changed conditions\" or \"extraordinary circumstances.\"                 See 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B), (D).       But even assuming that Pangemanan's\n\nasylum   application   was   not    time-barred,   the   IJ    found    that\n\nPangemanan had failed to establish a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution should she be returned to Indonesia. See Scatambuli v.\n\nHolder, 558 F.3d 53, 58 (1st Cir. 2009); see also 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1101(a)(42)(A).   Having failed to make the required showing for\n\nasylum relief, Pangemanan's request for withholding of removal was\n\nalso rejected. The IJ also denied Pangemanan relief under the CAT,\n\nfinding no evidence that Pangemanan would be tortured by or with\n\nthe acquiescence of the Indonesian government upon her return.\n\n           On February 29, 2008, the BIA affirmed in an opinion that\n\nlargely tracked the IJ's reasoning.         This timely petition for\n\nreview followed, raising only the question of denial of withholding\n\nof removal.2\n\n\n     2\n          Pangemanan has not made any arguments to us regarding her\nCAT claim, which we deem waived. See Scatambuli, 558 F.3d at 61;\nSinurat v. Mukasey, 537 F.3d 59, 62 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n                                    -4-\n\f                                      II.\n\n            This court lacks jurisdiction to review Pangemanan's\n\nasylum claim, which the IJ found time-barred.                  See 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1158(a)(3).     We address only Pangemanan's claim for withholding\n\nof removal.     Her argument is that the IJ erred in finding any fear\n\npetitioner had of returning to Indonesia was not objectively\n\nreasonable because the IJ did not account for numerous incidents\n\nwhich were geographically close to where she lived even if they\n\ninvolved other persons.       She also argues that the IJ and BIA failed\n\nto    account   for   an   overlay   of   government   laws,   policies,   and\n\npractices which penalize the Christian minority.                In sum, the\n\nargument is that the totality of the evidence was not considered.\n\n            Our review of the BIA's factual findings is under the\n\ndeferential substantial evidence standard.             Sinurat, 537 F.3d at\n\n61.     \"We uphold the BIA's findings if they are 'supported by\n\nreasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record\n\nconsidered as a whole.'\"        Id. (quoting Sharari, 407 F.3d at 473).\n\nThe BIA's factual findings are \"conclusive unless any reasonable\n\nadjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\"                8\n\nU.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B).\n\n            To qualify for withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1231(b)(3), an applicant must demonstrate that it is more likely\n\nthan not that she will face persecution in the country of removal.\n\nSee Scatambuli, 558 F.3d at 58; see also 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b).             We\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fhave described this showing as requiring a \"clear probability\" of\n\nfuture persecution.       See, e.g., Oroh v. Holder, 561 F.3d 62, 67\n\n(1st Cir. 2009).\n\n            We     conclude    that    substantial    evidence     supports    the\n\nconclusion that Pangemanan did not meet her burden of demonstrating\n\na   clear   probability       of    future    persecution.       Pangemanan,   her\n\nhusband,     and    daughters       never    themselves   were    mistreated   in\n\nIndonesia on account of their Christian faith. At most, Pangemanan\n\nhas alleged a series of isolated incidents involving others, which\n\nfall well short of the sort of systemic mistreatment indicative of\n\npast persecution or a clear probability of future persecution for\n\nher.   See Bocova v. Gonzales, 412 F.3d 257, 263 (1st Cir. 2005);\n\nsee also Budiono v. Mukasey, 548 F.3d 44, 48 (1st Cir. 2008) (\"To\n\nqualify as persecution, the harm to the petitioner must exceed\n\n'unpleasantness, harassment, and even basic suffering.'\"                (quoting\n\nNelson v. INS, 232 F.3d 258, 263 (1st Cir. 2000))); Susanto v.\n\nGonzales, 439 F.3d 57, 60-61 (1st Cir. 2006) (\"[P]ersecution\n\nrequires 'more than mere discomfiture, unpleasantness, harassment,\n\nor unfair treatment.'\"             (quoting Nikijuluw v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d\n\n115, 120 (1st Cir. 2005))); see generally Sombah v. Mukasey, 529\n\nF.3d 49, 51 (1st Cir. 2008) (\"Discrimination in Indonesia does not,\n\nwithout     more,    qualify       a   Christian   Indonesian      national    for\n\nasylum.\").    Moreover, the fact that Pangemanan’s family continues\n\nto live safely in Indonesia undermines her claim that she faces a\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\fclear   probability   of   future    persecution.   See,   e.g.,   Ouk   v.\n\nGonzales, 464 F.3d 108, 111 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n           Finally, contrary to Pangemanan’s assertions, the BIA and\n\nIJ fully considered all of the testimonial and documentary evidence\n\nsubmitted in support of her claim for relief.              The BIA also\n\ncorrectly noted that petitioner relied on riots in 1988 and country\n\nreports from 2002 and 2003.         We agree that these references were\n\nnot current and did not advance petitioner's cause.\n\n           The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f",

She also still lives in Indonesia and has experienced no further problems.</p>\n<p>Pangemanan has two daughters. Her daughters attended a Christian school in Indonesia. Although neither of her daughters was harmed while living in Indonesia, Pangemanan testified that Christian students were the victims of violence in Indonesia. Moreover, the father of her younger daughter's friend was beheaded in 2000.</p>\n<p>Pangemanan's husband testified that a Christian school founded by his grandfather was burned in 2000. His brother, however, continues to work as a police officer in the same town.</p>\n<p>On July 20, 2006, the IJ rejected Pangemanan's asylum application as untimely, and found the delay was not excused by \"changed conditions\" or \"extraordinary circumstances.\" <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B), (D). But even assuming that Pangemanan's asylum application was not time-barred, the IJ found that Pangemanan had failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution should she be returned to Indonesia. <i>See </i><i>Scatambuli v. Holder,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1355710\"><a href=\"/opinion/1355710/scatambuli-v-holder/\"><span class=\"volume\">558</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span>, 58 (1st Cir.2009); <i>see also</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A). Having failed to make the required showing for asylum relief, Pangemanan's request for withholding of removal was also rejected. The IJ also denied Pangemanan relief under the CAT, finding no evidence that Pangemanan would be tortured by or with the acquiescence of the Indonesian government upon her return.</p>\n<p>On February 29, 2008, the BIA affirmed in an opinion that largely tracked the IJ's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*3</span> reasoning. This timely petition for review followed, raising only the question of denial of withholding of removal.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>This court lacks jurisdiction to review Pangemanan's asylum claim, which the IJ found time-barred. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(3). We address only Pangemanan's claim for withholding of removal. Her argument is that the IJ erred in finding any fear petitioner had of returning to Indonesia was not objectively reasonable because the IJ did not account for numerous incidents which were geographically close to where she lived even if they involved other persons. She also argues that the IJ and BIA failed to account for an overlay of government laws, policies, and practices which penalize the Christian minority. In sum, the argument is that the totality of the evidence was not considered.</p>\n<p>Our review of the BIA's factual findings is under the deferential substantial evidence standard. <i>Sinurat,</i> 537 F.3d at 61. \"We uphold the BIA's findings if they are 'supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Sharari,</i> 407 F.3d at 473). The BIA's factual findings are \"conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p>To qualify for withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), an applicant must demonstrate that it is more likely than not that she will face persecution in the country of removal. <i>See </i><i>Scatambuli,</i> 558 F.3d at 58; <i>see also</i> 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b). We have described this showing as requiring a \"clear probability\" of future persecution. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Oroh v. Holder,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203747\"><a href=\"/opinion/203747/oroh-v-holder/\"><span class=\"volume\">561</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></a></span>, 67 (1st Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>We conclude that substantial evidence supports the conclusion that Pangemanan did not meet her burden of demonstrating a clear probability of future persecution. Pangemanan, her husband, and daughters never themselves were mistreated in Indonesia on account of their Christian faith. At most, Pangemanan has alleged a series of isolated incidents involving others, which fall well short of the sort of systemic mistreatment indicative of past persecution or a clear probability of future persecution for her. <i>See </i><i>Bocova v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201655\"><a href=\"/opinion/201655/bocova-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></a></span>, 263 (1st Cir.2005); <i>see also </i><i>Budiono v.

INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771091\"><a href=\"/opinion/771091/laeila-nelson-stephanie-nelson-phil-nelson-v-immigration-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">258</span></a></span>, 263 (1st Cir.2000))); <i>Susanto v.

Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201886\"><a href=\"/opinion/201886/nikijuluw-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span></a></span>, 120 (1st Cir.2005))); <i>see generally </i><i>Sombah v.

Moreover, the fact that Pangemanan's family continues to live safely in Indonesia undermines her claim that she faces a clear probability of future persecution. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Ouk v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202443\"><a href=\"/opinion/202443/ouk-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">108</span></a></span>, 111 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>Finally, contrary to Pangemanan's assertions, the BIA and IJ fully considered all of the testimonial and documentary evidence submitted in support of her claim <span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> for relief. The BIA also correctly noted that petitioner relied on riots in 1988 and country reports from 2002 and 2003.
