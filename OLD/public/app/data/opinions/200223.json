William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                     Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n                   Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                   and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n    Richard DeCato on memorandum pro se.\n\n\n\n                       November 27, 2002\n\f       Per Curiam.         Petitioner Richard J. DeCato Jr. has applied for\n\na certificate of appealability (COA) in order to appeal from the\n\ndismissal of his habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2255.                                           To\n\nqualify for a COA, he must make \"a substantial showing of the\n\ndenial of a constitutional right.\"                                 Id. § 2253(c)(2).             This\n\nstandard requires a demonstration that \"reasonable jurists could\n\ndebate whether ... the petition should have been resolved in a\n\ndifferent manner or that the issues presented were <adequate to\n\ndeserve encouragement to proceed further.'\" Slack v. McDaniel, 529\n\nU.S. 473, 484 (2000) (quoting Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U.S. 880,\n\n893    n.4   (1983)        (internal      quotation               marks      omitted)).        Having\n\nscrutinized petitioner's submissions and the relevant parts of the\n\nrecord, we conclude that this standard has not been met.\n\n       Pursuant to a written plea agreement, petitioner pled guilty\n\nin    1994   to    one     count     of   engaging                in    a    continuing      criminal\n\nenterprise        (CCE),     21    U.S.C.      §       848,       and       to   seventeen    related\n\ncharges.     He was sentenced in 1995 to a prison term of 308 months.\n\nPetitioner pursued no direct appeal.                              In May 2000, he filed the\n\ninstant § 2255 petition, setting forth six claims that mainly\n\ncomplained of ineffective assistance on the part of counsel.                                     In a\n\nmargin order, the district court summarily denied the petition as\n\nuntimely.         See      28   U.S.C.     §       2255       ¶    6    (prescribing         one-year\n\nlimitations period); see also Rogers v. United States, 180 F.3d\n\n349,    353-55      (1st    Cir.    1999)      (adopting                one-year     grace     period\n\n\n                                                   2\n\fcommencing on AEDPA's effective date of April 24, 1996), cert.\n\ndenied, 528 U.S. 1126 (2000).     The court thereafter denied a COA.\n\n     It is possible that at least one of petitioner's claims--that\n\nrelying on Richardson v. United States, 526 U.S. 813 (1999)--was\n\ntimely filed.    See, e.g., United States v. Lopez, 248 F.3d 427,\n\n430-32 (5th Cir.) (applying Richardson retroactively to case on\n\ncollateral review pursuant to § 2255 ¶ 6(3)), cert. denied, 122 S.\n\nCt. 222 (2001).      It is also at least arguable that a timely\n\nRichardson claim would mean that the entire petition was timely.\n\nRather than delve into the knotty issues surrounding application of\n\nthe limitations period here, we prefer to dispose of the claims on\n\nthe merits. We conclude that, regardless of the correctness of the\n\ndistrict   court's   procedural   ruling,   petitioner   has   failed   to\n\ndemonstrate \"that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether\n\nthe petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional\n\nright.\"    Slack, 529 U.S. at 484.\n\n     First.     Petitioner's first claim, which relies on Roe v.\n\nFlores-Ortega, 528 U.S. 470 (2000), complains of counsel's failure\n\nto file a direct appeal.      Even on the arguendo assumption that\n\nFlores can be invoked here, this claim falls short.            Petitioner\n\nacknowledges in his affidavit that he and counsel discussed the\n\npossibility of appealing on at least three occasions following\n\nimposition of sentence.    At no point does petitioner suggest, much\n\nless aver, that he gave counsel \"specific instructions\" to file a\n\n\n                                     3\n\fnotice of appeal.     Id. at 477.   His complaint instead amounts to a\n\ndisagreement with counsel's advice, which does not constitute a\n\nFlores violation.     In turn, even if the discussions with counsel\n\nfell short of a \"consult[ation]\" as the Court defined that term,\n\nsee id. at 478--a matter we do not decide--we think it clear for\n\nthree reasons that no constitutional violation would have obtained.\n\nFirst, the conviction here followed a guilty plea, which the Court\n\ndeemed a \"highly relevant factor.\"         Id. at 480.   Second, although\n\ncalculated in different fashion, the sentence imposed was virtually\n\nidentical to that contemplated by the plea agreement.              See id.\n\n(describing    as   pertinent   \"whether   the    defendant   received   the\n\nsentence bargained for as part of the plea\").         And third, a review\n\nof petitioner's other assignments of error suggests they would have\n\nhad negligible prospect of success.          Under these circumstances,\n\nFlores imposed no obligation on counsel to do more than he did.\n\n     Second.    Petitioner next asserts that he was entitled to some\n\nsentencing     reduction   to   reflect     his   cooperation    with    the\n\ngovernment.1    Yet as he acknowledges, an anticipated motion for\n\ndownward departure under U.S.S.G. § 5K1.1 was not pursued because\n\nhe refused to testify at the trial of his codefendants--something\n\nthe plea agreement obligated him to do.           And as he now concedes,\n\n\n     1\n       As with his other sentencing challenges, this argument, to\nthe extent advanced as a substantive claim independent of any\nineffective-assistance charge, would not be cognizable on\ncollateral review. See, e.g., Knight v. United States, 37 F.3d\n769, 771-74 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n                                    4\n\fhis earlier reliance on § 5K2.0 was misplaced.   See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Alegria, 192 F.3d 179, 189 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n     Third. Petitioner also complains that he failed to receive an\n\nadditional two-point reduction in his offense level as contemplated\n\nby the plea agreement. That stipulation concerned a deduction \"for\n\ntime served as a result of the federal prosecution in the District\n\nof Maine, to conform with the intent [of U.S.S.G.] § 5G1.3.\"   The\n\npresentence report (PSR) understandably voiced confusion about this\n\nprovision, inasmuch as § 5G1.3 provides a mechanism for addressing\n\na \"prior unexpired term of imprisonment\" and the Maine prison term\n\nhad already expired. Regardless, the PSR compensated under § 5G1.3\n\nby affording petitioner full credit for time served on an unexpired\n\nterm of imprisonment in New Hampshire--a proposal not included in\n\nthe plea agreement.   The ensuing sentence (308 months, commencing\n\nin mid-December 1995) was virtually identical to that recommended\n\nby the plea agreement (324 months, commencing in late July 1994).\n\nPetitioner's assertion that he should have received both the plea\n\nagreement's two-level reduction and the PSR's sixteen-month credit\n\nignores the fact that those two calculations were alternative means\n\nof implementing § 5G1.3.\n\n     Fourth. Petitioner also objects to his sentencing enhancement\n\nfor obstruction of justice.   Under the 1989 version of U.S.S.G. §\n\n3C1.1, a two-level increase was warranted if petitioner \"willfully\n\nimpeded or obstructed ... the administration of justice during the\n\n\n                                5\n\finvestigation or prosecution of the instant offense.\"                     The plea\n\nagreement recommended such an enhancement, as did the PSR, which\n\nnoted that petitioner had been \"a fugitive from justice from the\n\nNew Hampshire courts since 1982.\" Petitioner does not dispute that\n\nhis fugitive status obstructed justice in the state prosecution.\n\nYet he argues that, because the federal investigation allegedly did\n\nnot commence until after his recapture in 1990, he engaged in no\n\nobstructive behavior \"during the investigation or prosecution of\n\nthe instant offense.\"\n\n     Given the close connection between the state and federal\n\noffenses, this contention likely fails for the reasons recited in\n\nUnited States v. Emery, 991 F.2d 907, 910-12 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\nRegardless, even if the § 3C1.1 enhancement were open to challenge,\n\npetitioner has not made out a claim of ineffective assistance. His\n\ncomplaint is that counsel should have objected to that enhancement\n\nat sentencing or on appeal.         Yet such a course likely would have\n\nnullified the plea agreement and thereby raised the prospect of a\n\nlonger sentence.       We recently rejected an ineffective-assistance\n\nclaim under analogous circumstances.               See Cofske v. United States,\n\n290 F.3d 437, 443-45 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n     Fifth.     Petitioner's next challenge is to the use of the 1989\n\nversion   of    the   sentencing   guidelines.           Because   that    version\n\nincreased      the    penalties    for       tax    violations,    and     because\n\npetitioner's tax offenses were completed before that amendment took\n\n\n                                         6\n\feffect, he argues that the Ex Post Facto Clause required use of the\n\n1988   version     of   the   guidelines.           This      contention,   however,\n\noverlooks the policy statement in U.S.S.G. § 1B1.11(b)(3) and\n\naccompanying commentary, which supports the choice of guidelines\n\nmade here.      See also United States v. Regan, 989 F.2d 44, 48-49 (1st\n\nCir. 1993). Moreover, petitioner's claim of prejudice rests on the\n\nquestionable      premise     that   the       remedy   for    any   ex   post   facto\n\nviolation would be to apply the 1988 guidelines, not just to his\n\ntax offenses, but to all counts of conviction.                   See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Sullivan, 255 F.3d 1256, 1263 (10th Cir. 2001) (rejecting\n\nsimilar argument on ground that it would produce \"anomal[ous]\"\n\nresult whereby commission of additional crimes resulted in lower\n\noverall sentence), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1166 (2002).                       We also\n\nnote that the plea agreement endorsed use of a post-1988 version of\n\nthe guidelines.      Again, therefore, any challenge along these lines\n\nmight have nullified the agreement and threatened an increased\n\nsentence.    Counsel cannot be faulted for eschewing such a course.\n\n       Sixth.     Petitioner's final claim relies on Richardson, in\n\nwhich the Court held that the jury must unanimously agree which\n\nspecific drug violations make up the \"continuing series\" for a CCE\n\nconviction.      In a two-pronged argument, petitioner alleges that,\n\nbecause he was not informed of this requirement, (1) his guilty\n\nplea was not knowing, intelligent and voluntary, and (2) his\n\ncounsel rendered ineffective assistance.                   The first part of this\n\n\n                                           7\n\fclaim, not having been raised on direct appeal, is procedurally\n\ndefaulted.   See, e.g., Cody v. United States, 249 F.3d 47, 51-52\n\n(1st Cir. 2001).   It thus may be pursued on collateral review only\n\nif petitioner can demonstrate either \"cause\" and \"prejudice\" or\n\n\"actual innocence.\"   See, e.g., Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S.\n\n614, 622 (1998).   Petitioner has made none of these showings.\n\n     As explained in United States v. Scott, 218 F.3d 835, 837-39\n\n(8th Cir.), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1000 (2000), the unanimity\n\nquestion was not sufficiently novel at the time of petitioner's\n\nconviction so as to provide cause for the failure to raise it;\n\nindeed, petitioner himself acknowledges that one circuit court had\n\nheld in 1988 that unanimity was required in this context.   In turn,\n\njust as in United States v. Lopez, 248 F.3d 427, 433 (5th Cir.),\n\ncert. denied, 122 S. Ct. 222 (2001), we find no prejudice (or\n\nactual innocence).    Petitioner did not object to the PSR, which\n\ncontained a detailed account of his drug activity over the course\n\nof more than a decade.2   And he admitted in the plea agreement that\n\n$3 million in cash and thirteen separate properties were subject to\n\nforfeiture as a result of such activity. Against this backdrop, we\n\nthink it inconceivable that a jury would have failed to agree\n\n\n\n     2\n        To cite just three examples: petitioner distributed over\nfifty kilograms of cocaine and thousands of pounds of marijuana\nduring the 1980s and netted over $3 million from such sales (PSR ¶¶\n9 & 10); he visited his customer base on a weekly or bi-weekly\nbasis (¶ 28); and one customer purchased a kilogram of cocaine per\nmonth from him for several years (¶ 30).\n\n                                  8\n\funanimously upon three CCE predicates (or that petitioner could\n\nreasonably have so thought at the time of his plea).   Petitioner's\n\nonly attempts at a rebuttal--that his drug sales were unrelated\n\nevents and that he played no supervisory role--are belied by the\n\nrecord.   This lack of prejudice, in turn, also suffices to dispose\n\nof the ineffective-assistance component of the Richardson claim.\n\nAccord, e.g., Scott, 218 F.3d at 238.\n\n     For these reasons, the application for a COA is denied and the\n\nappeal is terminated.\n\n\n\n\n                                 9\n\f",

Petitioner's first claim, which relies on Roe v.\n\nFlores-Ortega, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118339\"><a href=\"/opinion/118339/roe-v-flores-ortega/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">470</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000), complains of counsel's failure\n\nto file a direct appeal.      Even on the arguendo assumption that\n\nFlores can be invoked here, this claim falls short.            Petitioner\n\nacknowledges in his affidavit that he and counsel discussed the\n\npossibility of appealing on at least three occasions following\n\nimposition of sentence.    At no point does petitioner suggest, much\n\nless aver, that he gave counsel \"specific instructions\" to file a\n\n\n                                     3\n\fnotice of appeal.     Id. at 477.   His complaint instead amounts to a\n\ndisagreement with counsel's advice, which does not constitute a\n\nFlores violation.     In turn, even if the discussions with counsel\n\nfell short of a \"consult[ation]\" as the Court defined that term,\n\nsee id. at 478--a matter we do not decide--we think it clear for\n\nthree reasons that no constitutional violation would have obtained.\n\nFirst, the conviction here followed a guilty plea, which the Court\n\ndeemed a \"highly relevant factor.\"         Id. at 480.   Second, although\n\ncalculated in different fashion, the sentence imposed was virtually\n\nidentical to that contemplated by the plea agreement.              See id.\n\n(describing    as   pertinent   \"whether   the    defendant   received   the\n\nsentence bargained for as part of the plea\").         And third, a review\n\nof petitioner's other assignments of error suggests they would have\n\nhad negligible prospect of success.          Under these circumstances,\n\nFlores imposed no obligation on counsel to do more than he did.\n\n     Second.    Petitioner next asserts that he was entitled to some\n\nsentencing     reduction   to   reflect     his   cooperation    with    the\n\ngovernment.1    Yet as he acknowledges, an anticipated motion for\n\ndownward departure under U.S.S.G. § 5K1.1 was not pursued because\n\nhe refused to testify at the trial of his codefendants--something\n\nthe plea agreement obligated him to do.           And as he now concedes,\n\n\n     1\n       As with his other sentencing challenges, this argument, to\nthe extent advanced as a substantive claim independent of any\nineffective-assistance charge, would not be cognizable on\ncollateral review. See, e.g., Knight v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195690\"><a href=\"/opinion/195690/knight-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">769</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 771-74 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n                                    4\n\fhis earlier reliance on § 5K2.0 was misplaced.   See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Alegria, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198656\"><a href=\"/opinion/198656/united-states-v-alegria/\"><span class=\"volume\">192</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">179</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 189 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n     Third. Petitioner also complains that he failed to receive an\n\nadditional two-point reduction in his offense level as contemplated\n\nby the plea agreement. That stipulation concerned a deduction \"for\n\ntime served as a result of the federal prosecution in the District\n\nof Maine, to conform with the intent [of U.S.S.G.] § 5G1.3.\"   The\n\npresentence report (PSR) understandably voiced confusion about this\n\nprovision, inasmuch as § 5G1.3 provides a mechanism for addressing\n\na \"prior unexpired term of imprisonment\" and the Maine prison term\n\nhad already expired. Regardless, the PSR compensated under § 5G1.3\n\nby affording petitioner full credit for time served on an unexpired\n\nterm of imprisonment in New Hampshire--a proposal not included in\n\nthe plea agreement.   The ensuing sentence (308 months, commencing\n\nin mid-December 1995) was virtually identical to that recommended\n\nby the plea agreement (324 months, commencing in late July 1994).\n\nPetitioner's assertion that he should have received both the plea\n\nagreement's two-level reduction and the PSR's sixteen-month credit\n\nignores the fact that those two calculations were alternative means\n\nof implementing § 5G1.3.\n\n     Fourth. Petitioner also objects to his sentencing enhancement\n\nfor obstruction of justice.   Under the 1989 version of U.S.S.G. §\n\n3C1.1, a two-level increase was warranted if petitioner \"willfully\n\nimpeded or obstructed ... the administration of justice during the\n\n\n                                5\n\finvestigation or prosecution of the instant offense.\"                     The plea\n\nagreement recommended such an enhancement, as did the PSR, which\n\nnoted that petitioner had been \"a fugitive from justice from the\n\nNew Hampshire courts since 1982.\" Petitioner does not dispute that\n\nhis fugitive status obstructed justice in the state prosecution.\n\nYet he argues that, because the federal investigation allegedly did\n\nnot commence until after his recapture in 1990, he engaged in no\n\nobstructive behavior \"during the investigation or prosecution of\n\nthe instant offense.\"\n\n     Given the close connection between the state and federal\n\noffenses, this contention likely fails for the reasons recited in\n\nUnited States v. Emery, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"605526\"><a href=\"/opinion/605526/united-states-v-charles-e-emery/\"><span class=\"volume\">991</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">907</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 910-12 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\nRegardless, even if the § 3C1.1 enhancement were open to challenge,\n\npetitioner has not made out a claim of ineffective assistance. His\n\ncomplaint is that counsel should have objected to that enhancement\n\nat sentencing or on appeal.         Yet such a course likely would have\n\nnullified the plea agreement and thereby raised the prospect of a\n\nlonger sentence.       We recently rejected an ineffective-assistance\n\nclaim under analogous circumstances.               See Cofske v. United States,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199961\"><a href=\"/opinion/199961/cofske-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">290</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">437</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 443-45 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n     Fifth.     Petitioner's next challenge is to the use of the 1989\n\nversion   of    the   sentencing   guidelines.           Because   that    version\n\nincreased      the    penalties    for       tax    violations,    and     because\n\npetitioner's tax offenses were completed before that amendment took\n\n\n                                         6\n\feffect, he argues that the Ex Post Facto Clause required use of the\n\n1988   version     of   the   guidelines.           This      contention,   however,\n\noverlooks the policy statement in U.S.S.G. § 1B1.11(b)(3) and\n\naccompanying commentary, which supports the choice of guidelines\n\nmade here.      See also United States v. Regan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602836\"><a href=\"/opinion/602836/united-states-v-peter-j-regan/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 48-49 (1st\n\nCir. 1993). Moreover, petitioner's claim of prejudice rests on the\n\nquestionable      premise     that   the       remedy   for    any   ex   post   facto\n\nviolation would be to apply the 1988 guidelines, not just to his\n\ntax offenses, but to all counts of conviction.                   See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Sullivan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773918\"><a href=\"/opinion/773918/united-states-of-america-v-johnnie-c-sullivan/\"><span class=\"volume\">255</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1256</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1263 (10th Cir. 2001) (rejecting\n\nsimilar argument on ground that it would produce \"anomal[ous]\"\n\nresult whereby commission of additional crimes resulted in lower\n\noverall sentence), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1166</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2002).                       We also\n\nnote that the plea agreement endorsed use of a post-1988 version of\n\nthe guidelines.      Again, therefore, any challenge along these lines\n\nmight have nullified the agreement and threatened an increased\n\nsentence.    Counsel cannot be faulted for eschewing such a course.\n\n       Sixth.     Petitioner's final claim relies on Richardson, in\n\nwhich the Court held that the jury must unanimously agree which\n\nspecific drug violations make up the \"continuing series\" for a CCE\n\nconviction.      In a two-pronged argument, petitioner alleges that,\n\nbecause he was not informed of this requirement, (1) his guilty\n\nplea was not knowing, intelligent and voluntary, and (2) his\n\ncounsel rendered ineffective assistance.                   The first part of this\n\n\n                                           7\n\fclaim, not having been raised on direct appeal, is procedurally\n\ndefaulted.   See, e.g., Cody v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199404\"><a href=\"/opinion/199404/cody-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">249</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 51-52\n\n(1st Cir. 2001).   It thus may be pursued on collateral review only\n\nif petitioner can demonstrate either \"cause\" and \"prejudice\" or\n\n\"actual innocence.\"   See, e.g., Bousley v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118205\"><a href=\"/opinion/118205/bousley-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">614</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 622 (1998).   Petitioner has made none of these showings.\n\n     As explained in United States v. Scott, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769436\"><a href=\"/opinion/769436/united-states-v-christopher-scott-and-johnny-ray-butler/\"><span class=\"volume\">218</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">835</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 837-39\n\n(8th Cir.), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1000</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000), the unanimity\n\nquestion was not sufficiently novel at the time of petitioner's\n\nconviction so as to provide cause for the failure to raise it;\n\nindeed, petitioner himself acknowledges that one circuit court had\n\nheld in 1988 that unanimity was required in this context.   In turn,\n\njust as in United States v. Lopez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"23943\"><a href=\"/opinion/23943/united-states-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">248</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">427</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 433 (5th Cir.),\n\ncert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">222</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2001), we find no prejudice (or\n\nactual innocence).    Petitioner did not object to the PSR, which\n\ncontained a detailed account of his drug activity over the course\n\nof more than a decade.2   And he admitted in the plea agreement that\n\n$3 million in cash and thirteen separate properties were subject to\n\nforfeiture as a result of such activity. Against this backdrop, we\n\nthink it inconceivable that a jury would have failed to agree\n\n\n\n     2\n        To cite just three examples: petitioner distributed over\nfifty kilograms of cocaine and thousands of pounds of marijuana\nduring the 1980s and netted over $3 million from such sales (PSR ¶¶\n9 & 10); he visited his customer base on a weekly or bi-weekly\nbasis (¶ 28); and one customer purchased a kilogram of cocaine per\nmonth from him for several years (¶ 30).\n\n                                  8\n\funanimously upon three CCE predicates (or that petitioner could\n\nreasonably have so thought at the time of his plea).   Petitioner's\n\nonly attempts at a rebuttal--that his drug sales were unrelated\n\nevents and that he played no supervisory role--are belied by the\n\nrecord.   This lack of prejudice, in turn, also suffices to dispose\n\nof the ineffective-assistance component of the Richardson claim.\n\nAccord, e.g., Scott, 218 F.3d at 238.\n\n     For these reasons, the application for a COA is denied and the\n\nappeal is terminated.\n\n\n\n\n                                 9\n\f</pre>",
