Abul Maksud Sayied appeals the district\n\ncourt's dismissal without prejudice of his complaint for failure to\n\ncomply with Rule 8(a) and (e) of the Federal Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure.    Although Sayied has expressly requested oral argument,\n\nwe conclude that no substantial question is presented by the appeal\n\nand therefore deny the motion.   See 1st Cir. R. 27(c).   Sayied's de\n\nfacto request to append an addendum to his reply brief is granted.\n\n          The district court's dismissal for failure to comply with\n\nthe requirements of Rule 8 is subject to review only for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.    Kuehl v. F.D.I.C., 8 F.3d 905, 908 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n\"Dismissal [for noncompliance with Rule 8] is usually reserved for\n\nthose cases in which the complaint is so confused, ambiguous,\n\nvague, or otherwise unintelligible that its true substance, if any,\n\nis well disguised.\"    Salahuddin v. Cuomo, 861 F.2d 40, 42 (2d Cir.\n\n1988).   The complaint in this case unquestionably falls into that\n\ncategory and is so prolix, redundant and unintelligible that it\n\nwould have been unreasonable to expect defendants to frame a\n\nresponse to it.    Accordingly, we discern no abuse of discretion in\n\nthe district court's determination nor in its choice of sanction.\n\nSee 5 Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice &\n\nProcedure ยง 1281, at 522 (2d ed. 1990)(\"Unnecessary prolixity in a\n\npleading places an unjustified burden on the court and the party\n\nwho must respond to it because they are forced to select the\n\nrelevant material from a mass of verbiage\").\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\f          To the extent Sayied contends that the district court's\n\ndecision was motivated by bias or discrimination, he has offered\n\nnothing in support of those allegations other than the fact that\n\nthe court dismissed his complaint.    As discussed, dismissal was\n\nproper.\n\n          Affirmed.   See 1st Cir. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                -3-\n\f",
