Garcia,\nUnited States Attorney, and Germán A. Rieckehoff, Assistant United\nStates Attorney, were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n                                 April 7, 2005\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the District of Maine, sitting by designation.\n\f          Per Curiam.      On February 21, 2002, after a five-day\n\ntrial, a jury convicted Juan Santiago-Vazquez (\"Santiago\") on one\n\ncount of conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, 21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 846 (2000).   He was thereafter sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nHe now appeals, claiming ineffective assistance of counsel, trial\n\nerrors and errors at sentencing. He has supplemented his counsel's\n\nbrief with his own.\n\n          From the evidence presented at trial, the jury could have\n\nfound the following.    Between 1990 and 1993, Santiago ran a drug\n\npoint in the Manuel A. Perez housing projects in Puerto Rico.\n\nSantiago's organization primarily sold crack--1.5 to 2 kilograms\n\nper month, and over five kilograms in 1992 alone--but also dabbled\n\nin cocaine, heroin and marijuana. Santiago supervised at least ten\n\nother individuals in the operation of his drug point.\n\n          Starting in 1991, Santiago's organization found itself at\n\nwar with rival drug dealers in the area.      Over the course of the\n\nconflict--which lasted through 1993--Santiago allied himself with\n\nanother drug dealer named Victor Negrón.        Negrón and Santiago\n\nloaned firearms to one another for protection, sold drugs to one\n\nanother, and coordinated manhunts to kill the supporters of rival\n\ngangs.\n\n          Santiago planned and sanctioned the participation of his\n\nsubordinates in these manhunts, which resulted in the deaths of at\n\nleast five rivals.    The firearms used in these killings, as well as\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fin   the   day-to-day   operations    of   Santiago's   drug   enterprise,\n\nincluded pistols, submachine guns, shotguns and rifles.          Santiago\n\nwas arrested with one such weapon in 1993, and a stock of similar\n\nweapons was seized from an apartment at which Santiago's main\n\nlieutenant was present.\n\n            At trial much of the government's testimony came from\n\nthree cooperating witnesses: Alexander Cruz-Rojas, who had run a\n\ndrug point near Santiago's and had fought against Santiago in the\n\ndrug war; Ramon Cesareo-Soto, who worked in Negrón's organization,\n\nwas closely allied with Santiago in the drug war, and frequented\n\nSantiago's drug point; and Negrón himself.        Given their professed\n\nroles in drug dealings and drug wars, their testimony was very\n\nharmful to Santiago.\n\n            We deal first with Santiago's myriad claims of trial\n\nerror, all of which are fact-based and none of which entails novel\n\nor complex issues of law.       The claims are, among others, that\n\ndefense counsel failed to object to leading questions, permitted\n\nintroduction of prejudicial evidence relating to events outside the\n\nrelevant time frame or not sufficiently connected to the defendant,\n\npermitted the jury to learn that other defendants had pled guilty,\n\nallowed answers from witnesses without personal knowledge of the\n\nevents, and permitted expert testimony from a witness not qualified\n\nas an expert.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f          Virtually none of these claims, many made in a sentence\n\nor two or at most a paragraph, is adequately developed on appeal,\n\nwhich is alone fatal.   See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17\n\n(1st Cir.), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1082 (1990).    In most cases, it\n\nappears that no objection was made in the district court, so review\n\nwould in any event be only for plain error, but no effort is made\n\non appeal to show that any such error likely altered the outcome of\n\nthe trial given the other evidence against the defendant.    United\n\nStates v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732 (1993).\n\n          Santiago says that various trial errors insufficient in\n\nthemselves may cumulate so as to undermine the fairness of a trial\n\nand make out a due process violation.        See United States v.\n\nSepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1195-96 (1st Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 512\n\nU.S. 1223 (1994); see also United States v. Meserve, 271 F.3d 314,\n\n332 (1st Cir. 2001).     However, the case against Santiago was a\n\nstrong one, uncontradicted by any witnesses for the defense; and in\n\nany event the brief on appeal fails to show that there were serious\n\nerrors, let alone a prejudicial accumulation.\n\n          The government has taken the trouble to address the\n\nindividual claims of error one by one.      If any one of them was\n\nproperly preserved in the district court and appeared to have a\n\nclear potential to alter the outcome of the trial, we would discuss\n\nit.   But none falls into this category.        Given their sketchy\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fdevelopment on appeal we think it is enough to say this and no more\n\nabout the individual trial error claims.\n\n            Santiago's next challenge (made in his pro se brief) is\n\nto the court's special verdict form.           The form, a modified version\n\nof which had been requested by defense counsel, asked jurors three\n\nquestions: first, whether Santiago was guilty of the conspiracy to\n\ndistribute drugs charged in the indictment; second, whether more\n\nthan a specific quantity of each of four named drugs was involved;\n\nand third, whether Santiago had conspired to commit murder over the\n\ncourse of the conspiracy.           The drug quantities contained in the\n\nsecond question had been charged in the indictment against Santiago\n\nand were included in response to a defense argument invoking\n\nApprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000). The murders mentioned\n\nin the third question were not charged in the indictment, but could\n\nhave    resulted   in   a   sentencing      enhancement   under     U.S.S.G.   §\n\n2D1.1(d)(1); defense counsel therefore sought a separate jury\n\ndetermination regarding the murders on the theory (loosely stated\n\nby counsel) that Apprendi applied to that particular enhancement\n\nunder the guidelines.\n\n            Santiago--this     is    his    own   argument,   not    appellate\n\ncounsel's--says that the second and third questions both pointed\n\nthe jury in the direction of a life sentence, so that either way he\n\nlost.    That either alternative sufficed to raise the sentencing\n\nrange is true, but that is a function of the guideline in question.\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fSee U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1.    Santiago would not have \"lost\" if the jury\n\nhad answered in the negative on both questions; unfortunately for\n\nSantiago, the jury found that the government had proven its drug\n\nquantities beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n          Alternatively,     Santiago   complains   that   the    second\n\nquestion did not allow the jury to find lesser drug quantities than\n\nthose specified. This misunderstands the function of the question,\n\nwhich was simply to determine in accordance with Apprendi whether\n\nfacts charged in the indictment (and raising the statutory maximum)\n\nhad been proven to a jury.    If the jury concluded that only lesser\n\namounts had been proven, the answer would have been negative and\n\nthe precise lesser quantity irrelevant to the issue that Apprendi\n\nreserved for the jury.\n\n          Santiago's final challenge to the special verdict form\n\nclaims that the mention of murder in the form unfairly prejudiced\n\nthe jury against him--particularly because no murders were charged\n\nin his indictment. Leaving aside the fact that the special verdict\n\nform--in particular the question about murders--was requested by\n\ndefense counsel and opposed by the government, we note that there\n\nhad already been ample (and appropriate) testimony about Santiago's\n\ninvolvement in the murders over the course of the trial.         The jury\n\nwould have already known of Santiago's alleged involvement in the\n\nkillings, and that knowledge would not have disappeared once\n\ndeliberations began.    If the additional mention of drug murders in\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fthe special verdict form affected the jury's deliberations at all,\n\nit could not have tainted them so effectively as to amount to a\n\ndenial of due process to Santiago.\n\n            Santiago also contests two of his supervised release\n\nconditions: (1) that he submit to drug tests at his probation\n\nofficer's discretion; and (2) that he participate in a substance\n\nabuse program at the officer's discretion if those tests are\n\npositive.     Santiago      did    not    object   to   either   condition   at\n\nsentencing, but the government concedes that both conditions are\n\nplain error under United States v. Melendez-Santana, 353 F.3d 93\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).     Melendez said that both conditions were error\n\nbut, for reasons not relevant here, the court was required to\n\ndecide only whether one of them was \"plain error\" and made no\n\nruling as to whether the other would be so classified.\n\n            Two judges of this court have recently questioned whether\n\nMelendez'   plain   error    analysis      is   correct,   United   States   v.\n\nPadilla, 393 F.3d 256, 259-61 (1st Cir. 2004) (Campbell and Selya,\n\nJJ., concurring in the judgment), and we have recently granted\n\nrehearing en banc in that case to assess the continued viability of\n\nthe Melendez rationale.           But unless and until the en banc court\n\nholds to the contrary, Melendez' analysis controls. The government\n\nconcedes that both delegations in this case are inconsistent with\n\nMelendez and does not seek to distinguish between them as to\n\n\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\f\"plainness.\" Under these circumstances, we accept the government's\n\nconcession without further inquiry.\n\n                Santiago's remaining challenges to his sentence do not\n\nfare       as   well.     Santiago    claims    that   both       of   his   sentencing\n\nenhancements--two levels for possession of a firearm in connection\n\nwith the offense, U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(1), and four levels for a\n\nleadership        role    in   the   offense,   U.S.S.G.      §    3B1.1(a)--violate\n\nBlakely v. Washington, 124 S. Ct. 2531 (2004), as do the guidelines\n\nas a whole.        Although Santiago relied upon Apprendi in seeking a\n\nspecial verdict form, he got such a form (even if not exactly the\n\none he sought) and he thereafter made no further attack on the\n\nguidelines at sentencing.             We thus review for plain error.2\n\n                Following the Supreme Court's decision in United States\n\nv. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005), and this circuit's decision in\n\nUnited States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68 (1st Cir. 2005), the\n\ndistrict        court's    use   of    mandatory   guidelines          at    sentencing\n\nconstitutes \"error\" that is \"plain.\"               Nonetheless, Santiago must\n\nstill demonstrate prejudice and fundamental unfairness. See Olano,\n\n507 U.S. at 732-36; Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 77. In particular,\n\nSantiago must show that there is a reasonable probability that he\n\nwould have been sentenced differently but for the error.                           \"The\n\n\n\n       2\n      Santiago claims that his allocution at sentencing, in which\nhe denied having dealt drugs with his co-conspirators, is enough to\npreserve his Blakely claim on the leadership enhancement.        We\ndisagree.\n\n                                          -8-\n\fburden is on the defendant to convince us on specific facts\" that\n\nthis is so.    Id. at 80.\n\n           Santiago has been afforded the opportunity to point to\n\nsuch facts in supplemental briefing, but has failed to do so.                 He\n\nnotes   that   the   district   court    stated     that   its    sentence    and\n\nenhancements were \"pursuant to the guidelines,\" and that it relied\n\nprimarily (or perhaps exclusively) on the presentence report to\n\nsupport its enhancements.           But the former is not sufficient to\n\nsuggest   that    the     district    court    would   have      sentenced    him\n\ndifferently under a discretionary post-Booker regime; and the\n\nlatter remains a valid exercise of the district court's authority\n\neven after Booker.       Santiago has pointed to nothing exceptional or\n\nsympathetic about his case that would give us reason to suspect\n\nthat the district court would have sentenced him more leniently had\n\nit been empowered to do so, and without more he has failed to meet\n\nthe requirements of Antonakopoulos for remand and resentencing.\n\n           There remains the claim that Santiago's trial counsel\n\nwas ineffective.        Such claims cannot be raised on direct appeal,\n\nsave in the rare case where the error claimed can be considered\n\nwithout further development of the record--a step usually necessary\n\nto   determine    why     counsel    took     the   actions      challenged   as\n\nincompetent.     See United States v. Martinez-Vargas, 321 F.3d 245,\n\n251 (1st Cir. 2003).       This case falls squarely within the general\n\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\frule and we decline to reach the ineffective assistance claim,\n\nwithout prejudice to a section 2255 motion.\n\n          We affirm Santiago's conviction and sentence save that we\n\nvacate the drug treatment and drug testing portions of Santiago's\n\nsupervised release conditions, and remand for resentencing as to\n\nthose conditions.\n\n          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n                      Concurrence follows.\n\n\n\n\n                               -10-\n\f           CARTER, Senior District Judge, concurring.                I concur in\n\nthe Opinion of the majority in its decision on the merits of\n\nDefendant’s challenges to the validity of his conviction and the\n\nvacating of   the      drug    treatment      and   drug   testing   portions   of\n\nDefendant’s supervised release conditions.\n\n           Because this panel is bound by a preexisting panel\n\ndecision of this court, see Eulitt v. Me. Dep’t. Of Educ., 386 F.3d\n\n344, 349 (1st Cir. 2004), I reluctantly, and on that specific basis\n\nalone,   concur   as    to    the    majority’s     rejection   of   Defendant’s\n\nchallenge, on the basis of Blakely v. Washington, 124 S. Ct. 2531\n\n(2004) and United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005), to the\n\nvalidity of his sentence.           While I must accept, for purposes of my\n\nparticipation in this case, the holding of a panel of this circuit\n\nin United States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68 (1st Cir. 2005), I\n\ndo not agree with that decision’s rationale or holding.                  I share\n\nthe concerns raised by Judge Lipez in his concurring opinion in\n\nUnited States v. Serrano-Beauvaix, No. 02-2286, 2005 WL 503247 (1st\n\nCir. Mar. 4, 2005).           I believe, however, that the rationale of\n\nAntonakopoulos is more deeply flawed in its constitutional analysis\n\nthan even Judge Lipez suggests in Serrano-Beauvaix.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\f",

In most cases, it\n\nappears that no objection was made in the district court, so review\n\nwould in any event be only for plain error, but no effort is made\n\non appeal to show that any such error likely altered the outcome of\n\nthe trial given the other evidence against the defendant.

However, the case against Santiago was a\n\nstrong one, uncontradicted by any witnesses for the defense; and in\n\nany event the brief on appeal fails to show that there were serious\n\nerrors, let alone a prejudicial accumulation.\n\n          The government has taken the trouble to address the\n\nindividual claims of error one by one.      If any one of them was\n\nproperly preserved in the district court and appeared to have a\n\nclear potential to alter the outcome of the trial, we would discuss\n\nit.   But none falls into this category.        Given their sketchy\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fdevelopment on appeal we think it is enough to say this and no more\n\nabout the individual trial error claims.\n\n            Santiago's next challenge (made in his pro se brief) is\n\nto the court's special verdict form.           The form, a modified version\n\nof which had been requested by defense counsel, asked jurors three\n\nquestions: first, whether Santiago was guilty of the conspiracy to\n\ndistribute drugs charged in the indictment; second, whether more\n\nthan a specific quantity of each of four named drugs was involved;\n\nand third, whether Santiago had conspired to commit murder over the\n\ncourse of the conspiracy.           The drug quantities contained in the\n\nsecond question had been charged in the indictment against Santiago\n\nand were included in response to a defense argument invoking\n\nApprendi v. New Jersey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000). The murders mentioned\n\nin the third question were not charged in the indictment, but could\n\nhave    resulted   in   a   sentencing      enhancement   under     U.S.S.G.   §\n\n2D1.1(d)(1); defense counsel therefore sought a separate jury\n\ndetermination regarding the murders on the theory (loosely stated\n\nby counsel) that Apprendi applied to that particular enhancement\n\nunder the guidelines.\n\n            Santiago--this     is    his    own   argument,   not    appellate\n\ncounsel's--says that the second and third questions both pointed\n\nthe jury in the direction of a life sentence, so that either way he\n\nlost.    That either alternative sufficed to raise the sentencing\n\nrange is true, but that is a function of the guideline in question.\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fSee U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1.    Santiago would not have \"lost\" if the jury\n\nhad answered in the negative on both questions; unfortunately for\n\nSantiago, the jury found that the government had proven its drug\n\nquantities beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n          Alternatively,     Santiago   complains   that   the    second\n\nquestion did not allow the jury to find lesser drug quantities than\n\nthose specified. This misunderstands the function of the question,\n\nwhich was simply to determine in accordance with Apprendi whether\n\nfacts charged in the indictment (and raising the statutory maximum)\n\nhad been proven to a jury.    If the jury concluded that only lesser\n\namounts had been proven, the answer would have been negative and\n\nthe precise lesser quantity irrelevant to the issue that Apprendi\n\nreserved for the jury.\n\n          Santiago's final challenge to the special verdict form\n\nclaims that the mention of murder in the form unfairly prejudiced\n\nthe jury against him--particularly because no murders were charged\n\nin his indictment. Leaving aside the fact that the special verdict\n\nform--in particular the question about murders--was requested by\n\ndefense counsel and opposed by the government, we note that there\n\nhad already been ample (and appropriate) testimony about Santiago's\n\ninvolvement in the murders over the course of the trial.         The jury\n\nwould have already known of Santiago's alleged involvement in the\n\nkillings, and that knowledge would not have disappeared once\n\ndeliberations began.    If the additional mention of drug murders in\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fthe special verdict form affected the jury's deliberations at all,\n\nit could not have tainted them so effectively as to amount to a\n\ndenial of due process to Santiago.\n\n            Santiago also contests two of his supervised release\n\nconditions: (1) that he submit to drug tests at his probation\n\nofficer's discretion; and (2) that he participate in a substance\n\nabuse program at the officer's discretion if those tests are\n\npositive.     Santiago      did    not    object   to   either   condition   at\n\nsentencing, but the government concedes that both conditions are\n\nplain error under United States v. Melendez-Santana, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200784\"><a href=\"/opinion/200784/united-states-v-melendez-santana/\"><span class=\"volume\">353</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).     Melendez said that both conditions were error\n\nbut, for reasons not relevant here, the court was required to\n\ndecide only whether one of them was \"plain error\" and made no\n\nruling as to whether the other would be so classified.\n\n            Two judges of this court have recently questioned whether\n\nMelendez'   plain   error    analysis      is   correct,   United   States   v.\n\nPadilla, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">256</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 259-61 (1st Cir. 2004) (Campbell and Selya,\n\nJJ., concurring in the judgment), and we have recently granted\n\nrehearing en banc in that case to assess the continued viability of\n\nthe Melendez rationale.           But unless and until the en banc court\n\nholds to the contrary, Melendez' analysis controls. The government\n\nconcedes that both delegations in this case are inconsistent with\n\nMelendez and does not seek to distinguish between them as to\n\n\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\f\"plainness.\" Under these circumstances, we accept the government's\n\nconcession without further inquiry.\n\n                Santiago's remaining challenges to his sentence do not\n\nfare       as   well.     Santiago    claims    that   both       of   his   sentencing\n\nenhancements--two levels for possession of a firearm in connection\n\nwith the offense, U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(1), and four levels for a\n\nleadership        role    in   the   offense,   U.S.S.G.      §    3B1.1(a)--violate\n\nBlakely v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2531</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2004), as do the guidelines\n\nas a whole.        Although Santiago relied upon Apprendi in seeking a\n\nspecial verdict form, he got such a form (even if not exactly the\n\none he sought) and he thereafter made no further attack on the\n\nguidelines at sentencing.             We thus review for plain error.2\n\n                Following the Supreme Court's decision in United States\n\nv. Booker, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

See Olano,\n\n507 U.S. at 732-36; Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 77. In particular,\n\nSantiago must show that there is a reasonable probability that he\n\nwould have been sentenced differently but for the error.                           \"The\n\n\n\n       2\n      Santiago claims that his allocution at sentencing, in which\nhe denied having dealt drugs with his co-conspirators, is enough to\npreserve his Blakely claim on the leadership enhancement.        We\ndisagree.\n\n                                          -8-\n\fburden is on the defendant to convince us on specific facts\" that\n\nthis is so.    Id. at 80.\n\n           Santiago has been afforded the opportunity to point to\n\nsuch facts in supplemental briefing, but has failed to do so.                 He\n\nnotes   that   the   district   court    stated     that   its    sentence    and\n\nenhancements were \"pursuant to the guidelines,\" and that it relied\n\nprimarily (or perhaps exclusively) on the presentence report to\n\nsupport its enhancements.           But the former is not sufficient to\n\nsuggest   that    the     district    court    would   have      sentenced    him\n\ndifferently under a discretionary post-Booker regime; and the\n\nlatter remains a valid exercise of the district court's authority\n\neven after Booker.       Santiago has pointed to nothing exceptional or\n\nsympathetic about his case that would give us reason to suspect\n\nthat the district court would have sentenced him more leniently had\n\nit been empowered to do so, and without more he has failed to meet\n\nthe requirements of Antonakopoulos for remand and resentencing.\n\n           There remains the claim that Santiago's trial counsel\n\nwas ineffective.        Such claims cannot be raised on direct appeal,\n\nsave in the rare case where the error claimed can be considered\n\nwithout further development of the record--a step usually necessary\n\nto   determine    why     counsel    took     the   actions      challenged   as\n\nincompetent.
