Dryden, Office of Immigration\nLitigation, United States Department of Justice, Civil Division,\nwere on the brief, for respondent.\n\n\n\n\n                             October 8, 2003\n\n\n\n\n*   Of the Third Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f           STAPLETON, Circuit Judge.\n\n                                I.\n\n           Henry Kiyaga (“Petitioner”), a citizen of Uganda, appeals\n\nthe decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”), which\n\naffirmed, without opinion, the Immigration Judge’s (“IJ”) denial of\n\nhis application for asylum. The IJ held that Petitioner was barred\n\nfrom being granted asylum by 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(B) which\n\nstipulates that an alien is not a refugee for purposes of asylum if\n\nhe has persecuted others on account of nationality or political\n\nopinion. Petitioner challenges this holding. He also alleges that\n\nthe BIA erred in applying its summary affirmance procedure to his\n\ncase.\n\n                               II.\n\n           Petitioner’s military service in Uganda lasted from 1985\n\nto 1999.   In 1985, he began his military career by joining the\n\nFederal Democratic Army (“FDA”), a guerilla group opposing then-\n\nUgandan President Otobe.     Another guerilla group, the National\n\nResistance Army (“NRA”), was commanded by Yoweri Museveni. The NRA\n\ntoppled the existing Ugandan government in 1986 and integrated the\n\nFDA and other rival factions into one army. Petitioner served with\n\nthe NRA, which later changed its name to the Ugandan People’s\n\nDefense Force (“UPDF”), from 1986-1999.    Petitioner was placed in\n\nthe mobile unit of the Fourth Division.        During that period,\n\nPetitioner was involved in several regional conflicts in Uganda,\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fRwanda, and Zaire.             Zaire subsequently became the Democratic\n\nRepublic of Congo (“the Congo”).\n\n              In    1999,   Petitioner      was    imprisoned      by       the   UPDF.\n\nPetitioner asserts that he was jailed for complaining about the\n\nUPDF’s presence in the Congo, and the death of so many UPDF\n\nsoldiers in the conflict.          Petitioner was charged with planning to\n\nplot a coup against the UPDF,            conspiring to kill fellow soldiers,\n\nconspiring     to    control    Kisangani,      Congo,    and    insubordination.\n\nKiyaga asserts that he was tortured while in prison.                         At the IJ\n\nproceeding, he provided photographic evidence of his injuries that\n\nhe   claims    resulted     from   the    torture.       After    a    few    days    of\n\nimprisonment, Kiyaga was allowed to escape.                     In October, 1999,\n\nKiyaga fled to the United States.\n\n                                         III.\n\n              Kiyaga applied for asylum, claiming that he had suffered\n\npast persecution and had a well-founded fear of future persecution.\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1).          His application was denied.             Although the\n\nIJ concluded that Petitioner had carried his burden of showing past\n\npersecution,       he   held   that   asylum      was   barred    by    8    U.S.C.    §\n\n1101(a)(42)(B), which provides as follows:\n\n              The term “refugee” does not include any person\n              who ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise\n              participated in the persecution of any person\n              on account of race, religion, nationality,\n              membership in a particular social group, or\n              political opinion.\n\nAfter concluding that Petitioner had the burden of proving he was\n\n                                         -3-\n\fa refugee, the IJ found that Petitioner’s insistence that he had\n\nnot persecuted others on political grounds was simply not credible\n\nand, accordingly, insufficient to carry that burden.               The IJ went\n\non to find that the “documentary evidence in the record, as well as\n\nthe inconsistencies within the [Petitioner’s] testimony regarding\n\nthe killing of civilians, establish by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence that the [Petitioner] persecuted others.”\n\n            More     specifically,    the   IJ    found     that   “the   record\n\noverwhelmingly establish[ed] that the UPDF, including the Fourth\n\nDivision, was directly responsible for human rights violations\n\nagainst civilians, on account of their nationality and political\n\nopposition towards the ruling government.”           The court also pointed\n\nto specific atrocities committed by members of Petitioner’s unit\n\nand division, which occurred while Petitioner was a member of that\n\nforce.    The IJ, citing Fedorenko v. United States, 449 U.S. 490,\n\n494 (1981), held the Petitioner accountable for the actions of his\n\nmobile brigade unit because “he was present when these incidents\n\nhappened, he was issued a uniform and armed with a rifle to\n\npatrol.” The court found that although the Petitioner claimed that\n\nhe never harmed civilians, the fact that he supplied soldiers with\n\nfood,    clothing,    and   other    supplies    assisted    the   soldiers   in\n\npersecuting others. The IJ stated that “[b]ecause the [Petitioner]\n\ndid not act to stop civilian killings, he enabled persecution on\n\naccount of nationality and political opinion.”               Id.   Finally, the\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fIJ noted that, although “activity directly related to a civil war,\n\nsuch as forced recruitment, destruction of property, military\n\nattacks or mere membership in an organization is not necessarily\n\npersecution,”1 the Petitioner “was involved in activities beyond\n\nthe ‘natural occurrences’ of civil war.” The IJ based this finding\n\non   the    fact   that   Petitioner    was   a   member   of    a   governmental\n\norganization that participated in gross human rights violations on\n\naccount of nationality and political opinion.\n\n              The IJ ordered Petitioner removed to Uganda, and the BIA\n\nsummarily affirmed the IJ’s decision without opinion.                  8 C.F.R. §\n\n3.1(e)(4) (now 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(4)).\n\n                                       IV.\n\n              Kiyaga timely petitioned this Court for review of the\n\nBIA’s judgment.      We have jurisdiction to review the final order of\n\nremoval pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a).             When the BIA applies its\n\nstreamlined affirmance-without-opinion procedure, see 8 C.F.R. §\n\n1003.1(e)(4), we review the decision of the IJ.                 See Albathani v.\n\nINS, 318 F.3d 365, 378 (1st Cir. 2003) (stating that a court bases\n\nits review on the IJ’s decision and the record on which it is based\n\nwhen the 8 C.F.R. 3.1(a)(7)2 streamlining procedure is used);                 El\n\nMoraghy v. Ashcroft, 331 F.3d 195, 205 (1st Cir. 2003) (applying\n\n\n\n      1\n      See Matter of Rodriguez-Majano, 19 I. & N. Dec. 811 (BIA\n1988).\n      2\n          Now 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(a)(7).\n\n                                       -5-\n\fAlbathani to the affirmance without opinion procedure in 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 3.1(e)(4)).\n\n                                       V.\n\n               To be eligible for asylum, an alien has the burden of\n\nshowing that he or she is a “refugee.” 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1);\n\nFesseha v. Ashcroft, 333 F.3d 13, 18 (1st Cir. 2003).             As we have\n\nindicated, under § 1101(a)(42)(B), an alien cannot be a “refugee”\n\nif   he   or    she   has   assisted   or   otherwise   participated   in   the\n\npersecution of others on account of political opinions.             Moreover,\n\nas we have further noted, the IJ concluded that if there is\n\nevidence of such assistance or participation, the “applicant [has]\n\nthe burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he or\n\nshe did not so act.”         As is evident from Petitioner’s briefing and\n\nas expressly confirmed by Petitioner’s counsel at oral argument,\n\nPetitioner does not challenge any of these legal propositions. His\n\nargument is rather that the record will not support a finding that\n\nasylum is barred by § 1101(a)(42)(B).            We cannot agree.\n\n               Evidence was produced before the IJ tending the show that\n\nthe Petitioner had assisted in the persecution of others on account\n\nof a prohibited ground.           This included evidence that the UPDF\n\nforcefully relocated civilians into “protected camps.”              Civilians\n\nwere beaten if they refused to comply.           See Amnesty International,\n\nUganda:        Breaking the Circle:         Protecting Human Rights in the\n\nNorther War Zone (1999).          If civilians left the protected camps,\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fthey were assumed to be members of the opposing force.                     Evidence\n\nalso indicated that the UPDF mobile troops had shelled villages\n\nwhere civilians had returned from the protected camps to cultivate\n\ncrops.   Finally, there was evidence that UPDF soldiers in the\n\nFourth Division were involved in the lynching of civilians on\n\nAugust 16, 1996, in Gulu, Uganda.              This was Petitioner’s military\n\ndivision and he admits to being in Gulu at this time.                 Additional\n\nevidence indicated that the mobile patrol in which Petitioner\n\nserved was involved in killing 30 children in the Kitgum District\n\nin March of 1998, when it ambushed a group of opposing forces who\n\nwere holding the children captive.             Finally, evidence was produced\n\nthat Petitioner had indicated to an asylum officer in an interview\n\nthat he had killed or harmed non-combative civilians on four\n\ndifferent occasions in Uganda.\n\n          In response to this evidence, Petitioner attempted to\n\ncarry his burden of showing he was a refugee by offering his own\n\ntestimony that he had never participated in persecuting others.\n\nThe IJ concluded, however, that this testimony was not credible.\n\nThis credibility determination effectively resolves Petitioner’s\n\nasylum claim    because    no    other    evidence     was   presented      to   the\n\nImmigration Court that could prove by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence that       Petitioner   did     not    persecute    or   assist    in   the\n\npersecution    of     others.    Therefore,       if   the   IJ’s    credibility\n\ndetermination survives our scrutiny, we must deny the petition for\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\freview.\n\n            The    IJ’s    credibility      determination       is    reviewed     for\n\nsubstantial       evidence    and   “must       be   upheld    if     supported     by\n\nreasonable,    substantial      and   probative       evidence       on   the   record\n\nconsidered as a whole.”         Mendes v. INS, 197 F.3d 6, 13 (1st Cir.\n\n1999) (internal quotations omitted); see also Mediouni v. INS, 314\n\nF.3d 24, 26-27 (1st Cir. 2002).           We will reverse a finding of fact,\n\nsuch as a credibility determination, only if “the evidence is so\n\ncompelling that no reasonable fact-finder could fail to reach the\n\ncontrary conclusion.”         Oliva-Muralles v. Ashcroft, 328 F.3d 25, 27\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).\n\n            The     IJ’s     conclusion     that     Petitioner’s         denial    of\n\nparticipation in persecution lacks credibility was based primarily\n\non the fact that Petitioner provided inconsistent and evasive\n\nresponses to questions regarding his activities while serving in\n\nthe UPDF.     As the IJ explained:\n\n            When asked about the one time he served on the\n            front line, he says he never killed any\n            civilian.   On another occasion, he says he\n            never killed any civilians intentionally,\n            although he may have killed a civilian\n            accidentally.   When asked by the Service on\n            cross-examination, he was unable to give a\n            straight answer.\n\nThe IJ also pointed out the Assessment to Refer, which asserted\n\nthat   Petitioner     had     admitted     to    killing      civilians     on     four\n\noccasions, and the statement about civilians having to die if they\n\nwere caught between enemy forces.               There is substantial evidence\n\n                                      -8-\n\fsupporting these conclusions of the IJ.\n\n          In the Assessment to Refer, the asylum officer who\n\ninterviewed Petitioner asserted that Petitioner had admitted to\n\nkilling non-combative civilians on four separate occasions in\n\nUganda.   He also quoted the Petitioner as stating, “if they\n\n[civilians] were in the middle, they had to die, ... we were\n\nordered to do so, we had to fight.”\n\n          At Petitioner’s first hearing, he provided the following\n\nresponses to the government’s questions:\n\n          Q.   Sir, did you see civilians being killed\n          while you were involved in combat in the army?\n\n          A.   Yes, I did.\n\n          . . .\n\n          Q.   Sir, did you ever kill civilians during\n          your period in the army?\n\n          A.    No, in time I have never killed a\n          civilian.   I have never killed a civilian\n          intentional unless it happened by accident[.]\n          [B]ut I have never killed any civilian\n          intentionally.\n\n          . . .\n\n          Q. Sir, did you ever – do you believe that\n          you ever killed civilians accidentally?\n\n          A.   Well, it could be, I cannot say no or yes,\n\n          . . .\n\n\n          At Petitioner’s second removal hearing on April 5, 2001,\n\nhe stated the following:\n\n\n                                -9-\n\f         Q. Sir, is it your testimony that throughout\n         your 13 year military career, you were never\n         involved in the killing of civilians?\n\n         A. Personally, the entire period I was in the\n         military, I have never killed a civilian nor\n         tortured one.\n\n         . . .\n\n         Q.   Sir, did you tell the asylum officer\n         during your asylum interview that you were\n         involved in the killing of civilians?\n\n         A.   That question was raised to me and I\n         answered him directly that I have never\n         participated in the killing of civilians.\n\n         Petitioner was confronted with the Assessment to Refer\n\nmemo, written by the asylum officer, quoting the “if [civilians]\n\nwere in the middle, they had to die,” language.     The following\n\ncolloquy took place:\n\n          Q.   Sir, . . . the document says that the\n          applicant admitted that he has killed or\n          harmed non-combat civilians on four different\n          occasions.\n\n          . . .\n\n          Q. Sir, is now your testimony that you did\n          not say that you had killed or harmed\n          civilians on four different occasions?\n\n          . . .\n\n          A. Unless the officer did not understand the\n          language I tried to explain to him, but I\n          remember the question was raised to me and I\n          answered that I have never participated in the\n          killing of civilians.\n\n          The Petitioner explained that the interview with the\n\nasylum officer was conducted in English, and that he had had a\n\n                              -10-\n\fdifficult time communicating in that interview. Then the following\n\nexchange occurred:\n\n           A.    Sir, did you say and I am quoting\n           “Civilians were in the middle and they had to\n           die?”\n\n           . . .\n\n           Q. Yes, when the question was raised to me, I\n           answered him and said, and tried to explain to\n           him that when there is fighting going on and\n           the civilians are in the middle, they can\n           easily be killed, but I have never told him\n           that I have killed any civilian and I\n           personally have never intentionally killed any\n           civilian.\n\n           Petitioner cites Hartooni v. INS, 21 F.3d 336, 342 (9th\n\nCir.   1994),   for   the   proposition   that   the    IJ    must   provide   a\n\nlegitimate articulable basis for his credibility determination. He\n\nasserts that the IJ failed in this respect because he limited his\n\nanalysis   of   Petitioner’s    credibility      to    only   one    area,   his\n\ntestimony about whether he had killed civilians, when the whole of\n\nhis testimony was otherwise consistent and believable.\n\n           Hartooni holds that the IJ “must have a legitimate\n\narticulable basis to question the petitioner’s credibility, and\n\nmust offer a specific, cogent reason for any stated disbelief.” 21\n\nF.3d at 342.    As we have heretofore explained, however, the IJ did\n\nprovide a legitimate articulable basis to question the Petitioner’s\n\ncredibility.\n\n           Petitioner also quotes a page from the Basic Law Manual,\n\nproduced by the INS, as authority for the proposition that “a claim\n\n                                   -11-\n\fmay be credible even though the claimant later submits information\n\nnot submitted at the first examination.” U.S. Dep’t of Justice,\n\nImmigration and Naturalization Serv., The Basic Law Manual 105\n\n(1994).   Petitioner alleges that he did not have an interpreter at\n\nthe first examination, which resulted in perceived inconsistencies\n\nwith later interviews in which an interpreter was provided.                        He\n\nasserts his testimony at the removal proceeding was not truly\n\ninconsistent,    but    simply   an   attempt       to   clarify     his   earlier\n\nstatements in a logical and direct manner.\n\n          The discrepancy in Petitioner’s testimony does not simply\n\nreflect information that the Petitioner forgot to include in his\n\nfirst interview, which he is later elaborating or clarifying, as\n\nthe cited passage in the Basic Law Manual appears to contemplate.\n\nIt is an inconsistency in the testimony that makes it plausible,\n\neven likely, that the Petitioner is telling less than the whole\n\ntruth regarding his conduct toward civilians.\n\n          Petitioner also alleges that the inconsistency in his\n\ntestimony was not material because he consistently testified that\n\nhe did not intentionally kill civilians.                  He insists that an\n\ninconsistency must “shut off a line of inquiry which is relevant to\n\nthe alien’s eligibility and which might well have resulted in a\n\nproper determination that he be excluded.”               Matter of Bosuego, 17\n\nI. & N. Dec. 125 (BIA 1979); accord Solis-Muela v. INS, 13 F.3d\n\n372, 376-77     (10th   Cir.   1993).        Even   if   we   were   to    apply    a\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fmateriality standard, however, Petitioner’s inconsistent testimony\n\nregarding his participation in the killing of civilians was clearly\n\nrelevant     to    an     inquiry    into       the    presence      or     absence    of\n\nparticipation in          persecution.\n\n             Finally, Petitioner cites Qiu v. Ashcroft, 329 F.3d 140,\n\n156 (2d Cir. 2003), for the proposition that courts “have ...\n\nprodded immigration tribunals to give petitioners a chance to\n\nrespond      to   the     adjudicator’s         concerns     about        ‘missing’    or\n\ninconsistent evidence or testimony.”                  Petitioner asserts that the\n\nIJ failed to give his asylum application the benefit of doubt and\n\nassist    him     in   clarifying       and    substantiating      his     case.      But\n\nPetitioner was given an opportunity to respond to the government’s\n\nconcerns about the inconsistent testimony.                    His answers to this\n\nquestioning were not consistent or straightforward.\n\n             We    hold    that   the    IJ’s       credibility    determination       is\n\nsupported by substantial evidence.                  The Petitioner’s testimony was\n\nnot only inconsistent with the testimony he gave at an earlier\n\ninterview, it was inconsistent during the removal hearing itself.\n\nHe at first states, unequivocally, that he killed no civilians\n\nduring his military service.                  He then allows that he may have\n\n“accidentally” killed some.              We would also note, although the IJ\n\nwas not explicit in basing his credibility determination on this\n\npoint, that Petitioner testified that he had no reason to believe\n\nthat   the    Fourth      Division      of    the    UPDF   had   killed     civilians.\n\n\n                                             -13-\n\fHowever, evidence in the record indicated that members of the\n\nFourth Division participated in the lynching of civilians in Gulu\n\nat the time Petitioner was stationed there.          See Aguilar-Solis v.\n\nINS, 168 F.3d 565, 570-71 (1st Cir. 1999) (stating that it is not\n\nrequired that “a reviewing court must take every applicant’s\n\nuncontradicted testimony at face value, for testimony is sometimes\n\ninternally inconsistent or belied by prevailing circumstances” and\n\nthat “when a hearing officer who saw and heard a witness makes\n\nadverse credibility determination and supports it with specific\n\nfindings,    an   appellate   court     ordinarily    should   accord   it\n\nsignificant respect”).\n\n            For these reasons, the IJ’s credibility determination\n\nwithstands Petitioner’s challenge.          Having found that adverse\n\ncredibility determination supported by substantial evidence, the\n\nPetitioner did not meet his burden of showing that the persecution-\n\nof-others bar did not apply to him.        Therefore, we will deny the\n\npetition for review.\n\n                                  VI.\n\n            Petitioner argues that the BIA erred in applying 8 C.F.R.\n\n3.1(e) (now 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)), to affirm the result of the IJ’s\n\ndecision without opinion.\n\n            8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(4), the section used by the BIA to\n\naffirm without opinion states, in pertinent part:\n\n            Affirmance without opinion. (I) The Board\n            member to whom a case is assigned shall affirm\n\n                                 -14-\n\f          the decision of the Service or the immigration\n          judge, without opinion, if the Board member\n          determines that the result reached in the\n          decision under review was correct; that any\n          errors in the decision under review were\n          harmless or nonmaterial; and that\n\n          (A) The issues on appeal are squarely\n          controlled by existing Board or federal court\n          precedent and do not involve the application\n          of precedent to a novel factual situation; or\n          (B) The factual and legal issues raised on\n          appeal are not so substantial that the case\n          warrants the issuance of a written opinion in\n          the case.\n\n          Petitioner asserts that the IJ’s decision was not in\n\nconformity with the law or applicable precedents and was the result\n\nof clearly erroneous factual determinations.       It is a subject of\n\nsome debate whether we may review the BIA’s decision to apply the\n\nstreamlining regulation, itself.       See Albathani, 318 F.3d at 378\n\n(“Were there evidence of systemic violation by the BIA of its\n\nregulations, this would be a different case.    We would then have to\n\nface, inter alia, the INS’s claim that the decision to streamline\n\nan immigration appeal is not reviewable by the courts because these\n\nare matters committed to agency discretion.”). Because we conclude\n\nthat the IJ’s credibility determination is clearly supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence, the Petitioner failed to meet his burden of\n\nshowing his “refugee” status.      Therefore, we shall dispose of\n\nPetitioner’s argument without deciding whether we may review the\n\nBIA’s decision to apply the streamlining regulation.\n\n          The petition for review is DENIED.\n\n\n                                -15-\n\f",

The IJ held that Petitioner was barred\n\nfrom being granted asylum by 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(B) which\n\nstipulates that an alien is not a refugee for purposes of asylum if\n\nhe has persecuted others on account of nationality or political\n\nopinion. Petitioner challenges this holding. He also alleges that\n\nthe BIA erred in applying its summary affirmance procedure to his\n\ncase.\n\n                               II.\n\n           Petitioner’s military service in Uganda lasted from 1985\n\nto 1999.   In 1985, he began his military career by joining the\n\nFederal Democratic Army (“FDA”), a guerilla group opposing then-\n\nUgandan President Otobe.     Another guerilla group, the National\n\nResistance Army (“NRA”), was commanded by Yoweri Museveni. The NRA\n\ntoppled the existing Ugandan government in 1986 and integrated the\n\nFDA and other rival factions into one army. Petitioner served with\n\nthe NRA, which later changed its name to the Ugandan People’s\n\nDefense Force (“UPDF”), from 1986-1999.    Petitioner was placed in\n\nthe mobile unit of the Fourth Division.        During that period,\n\nPetitioner was involved in several regional conflicts in Uganda,\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fRwanda, and Zaire.             Zaire subsequently became the Democratic\n\nRepublic of Congo (“the Congo”).\n\n              In    1999,   Petitioner      was    imprisoned      by       the   UPDF.\n\nPetitioner asserts that he was jailed for complaining about the\n\nUPDF’s presence in the Congo, and the death of so many UPDF\n\nsoldiers in the conflict.          Petitioner was charged with planning to\n\nplot a coup against the UPDF,            conspiring to kill fellow soldiers,\n\nconspiring     to    control    Kisangani,      Congo,    and    insubordination.\n\nKiyaga asserts that he was tortured while in prison.                         At the IJ\n\nproceeding, he provided photographic evidence of his injuries that\n\nhe   claims    resulted     from   the    torture.       After    a    few    days    of\n\nimprisonment, Kiyaga was allowed to escape.                     In October, 1999,\n\nKiyaga fled to the United States.\n\n                                         III.\n\n              Kiyaga applied for asylum, claiming that he had suffered\n\npast persecution and had a well-founded fear of future persecution.\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1).          His application was denied.             Although the\n\nIJ concluded that Petitioner had carried his burden of showing past\n\npersecution,       he   held   that   asylum      was   barred    by    8    U.S.C.    §\n\n1101(a)(42)(B), which provides as follows:\n\n              The term “refugee” does not include any person\n              who ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise\n              participated in the persecution of any person\n              on account of race, religion, nationality,\n              membership in a particular social group, or\n              political opinion.\n\nAfter concluding that Petitioner had the burden of proving he was\n\n                                         -3-\n\fa refugee, the IJ found that Petitioner’s insistence that he had\n\nnot persecuted others on political grounds was simply not credible\n\nand, accordingly, insufficient to carry that burden.               The IJ went\n\non to find that the “documentary evidence in the record, as well as\n\nthe inconsistencies within the [Petitioner’s] testimony regarding\n\nthe killing of civilians, establish by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence that the [Petitioner] persecuted others.”\n\n            More     specifically,    the   IJ    found     that   “the   record\n\noverwhelmingly establish[ed] that the UPDF, including the Fourth\n\nDivision, was directly responsible for human rights violations\n\nagainst civilians, on account of their nationality and political\n\nopposition towards the ruling government.”           The court also pointed\n\nto specific atrocities committed by members of Petitioner’s unit\n\nand division, which occurred while Petitioner was a member of that\n\nforce.    The IJ, citing Fedorenko v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110381\"><a href=\"/opinion/110381/fedorenko-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">490</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n494 (1981), held the Petitioner accountable for the actions of his\n\nmobile brigade unit because “he was present when these incidents\n\nhappened, he was issued a uniform and armed with a rifle to\n\npatrol.” The court found that although the Petitioner claimed that\n\nhe never harmed civilians, the fact that he supplied soldiers with\n\nfood,    clothing,    and   other    supplies    assisted    the   soldiers   in\n\npersecuting others. The IJ stated that “[b]ecause the [Petitioner]\n\ndid not act to stop civilian killings, he enabled persecution on\n\naccount of nationality and political opinion.”               Id.   Finally, the\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fIJ noted that, although “activity directly related to a civil war,\n\nsuch as forced recruitment, destruction of property, military\n\nattacks or mere membership in an organization is not necessarily\n\npersecution,”1 the Petitioner “was involved in activities beyond\n\nthe ‘natural occurrences’ of civil war.” The IJ based this finding\n\non   the    fact   that   Petitioner    was   a   member   of    a   governmental\n\norganization that participated in gross human rights violations on\n\naccount of nationality and political opinion.\n\n              The IJ ordered Petitioner removed to Uganda, and the BIA\n\nsummarily affirmed the IJ’s decision without opinion.                  8 C.F.R. §\n\n3.1(e)(4) (now 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(4)).\n\n                                       IV.\n\n              Kiyaga timely petitioned this Court for review of the\n\nBIA’s judgment.      We have jurisdiction to review the final order of\n\nremoval pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a).

As we have\n\nindicated, under § 1101(a)(42)(B), an alien cannot be a “refugee”\n\nif   he   or    she   has   assisted   or   otherwise   participated   in   the\n\npersecution of others on account of political opinions.             Moreover,\n\nas we have further noted, the IJ concluded that if there is\n\nevidence of such assistance or participation, the “applicant [has]\n\nthe burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he or\n\nshe did not so act.”         As is evident from Petitioner’s briefing and\n\nas expressly confirmed by Petitioner’s counsel at oral argument,\n\nPetitioner does not challenge any of these legal propositions. His\n\nargument is rather that the record will not support a finding that\n\nasylum is barred by § 1101(a)(42)(B).            We cannot agree.\n\n               Evidence was produced before the IJ tending the show that\n\nthe Petitioner had assisted in the persecution of others on account\n\nof a prohibited ground.           This included evidence that the UPDF\n\nforcefully relocated civilians into “protected camps.”              Civilians\n\nwere beaten if they refused to comply.           See Amnesty International,\n\nUganda:        Breaking the Circle:         Protecting Human Rights in the\n\nNorther War Zone (1999).          If civilians left the protected camps,\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fthey were assumed to be members of the opposing force.                     Evidence\n\nalso indicated that the UPDF mobile troops had shelled villages\n\nwhere civilians had returned from the protected camps to cultivate\n\ncrops.   Finally, there was evidence that UPDF soldiers in the\n\nFourth Division were involved in the lynching of civilians on\n\nAugust 16, 1996, in Gulu, Uganda.              This was Petitioner’s military\n\ndivision and he admits to being in Gulu at this time.                 Additional\n\nevidence indicated that the mobile patrol in which Petitioner\n\nserved was involved in killing 30 children in the Kitgum District\n\nin March of 1998, when it ambushed a group of opposing forces who\n\nwere holding the children captive.             Finally, evidence was produced\n\nthat Petitioner had indicated to an asylum officer in an interview\n\nthat he had killed or harmed non-combative civilians on four\n\ndifferent occasions in Uganda.\n\n          In response to this evidence, Petitioner attempted to\n\ncarry his burden of showing he was a refugee by offering his own\n\ntestimony that he had never participated in persecuting others.\n\nThe IJ concluded, however, that this testimony was not credible.\n\nThis credibility determination effectively resolves Petitioner’s\n\nasylum claim    because    no    other    evidence     was   presented      to   the\n\nImmigration Court that could prove by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence that       Petitioner   did     not    persecute    or   assist    in   the\n\npersecution    of     others.    Therefore,       if   the   IJ’s    credibility\n\ndetermination survives our scrutiny, we must deny the petition for\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\freview.\n\n            The    IJ’s    credibility      determination       is    reviewed     for\n\nsubstantial       evidence    and   “must       be   upheld    if     supported     by\n\nreasonable,    substantial      and   probative       evidence       on   the   record\n\nconsidered as a whole.”         Mendes v.

As the IJ explained:\n\n            When asked about the one time he served on the\n            front line, he says he never killed any\n            civilian.   On another occasion, he says he\n            never killed any civilians intentionally,\n            although he may have killed a civilian\n            accidentally.   When asked by the Service on\n            cross-examination, he was unable to give a\n            straight answer.\n\nThe IJ also pointed out the Assessment to Refer, which asserted\n\nthat   Petitioner     had     admitted     to    killing      civilians     on     four\n\noccasions, and the statement about civilians having to die if they\n\nwere caught between enemy forces.               There is substantial evidence\n\n                                      -8-\n\fsupporting these conclusions of the IJ.\n\n          In the Assessment to Refer, the asylum officer who\n\ninterviewed Petitioner asserted that Petitioner had admitted to\n\nkilling non-combative civilians on four separate occasions in\n\nUganda.   He also quoted the Petitioner as stating, “if they\n\n[civilians] were in the middle, they had to die, ... we were\n\nordered to do so, we had to fight.”\n\n          At Petitioner’s first hearing, he provided the following\n\nresponses to the government’s questions:\n\n          Q.   Sir, did you see civilians being killed\n          while you were involved in combat in the army?\n\n          A.   Yes, I did.\n\n          . . .\n\n          Q.   Sir, did you ever kill civilians during\n          your period in the army?\n\n          A.    No, in time I have never killed a\n          civilian.   I have never killed a civilian\n          intentional unless it happened by accident[.]\n          [B]ut I have never killed any civilian\n          intentionally.\n\n          . . .\n\n          Q. Sir, did you ever – do you believe that\n          you ever killed civilians accidentally?\n\n          A.   Well, it could be, I cannot say no or yes,\n\n          . . .\n\n\n          At Petitioner’s second removal hearing on April 5, 2001,\n\nhe stated the following:\n\n\n                                -9-\n\f         Q. Sir, is it your testimony that throughout\n         your 13 year military career, you were never\n         involved in the killing of civilians?\n\n         A. Personally, the entire period I was in the\n         military, I have never killed a civilian nor\n         tortured one.\n\n         . . .\n\n         Q.   Sir, did you tell the asylum officer\n         during your asylum interview that you were\n         involved in the killing of civilians?\n\n         A.   That question was raised to me and I\n         answered him directly that I have never\n         participated in the killing of civilians.\n\n         Petitioner was confronted with the Assessment to Refer\n\nmemo, written by the asylum officer, quoting the “if [civilians]\n\nwere in the middle, they had to die,” language.     The following\n\ncolloquy took place:\n\n          Q.   Sir, . . . the document says that the\n          applicant admitted that he has killed or\n          harmed non-combat civilians on four different\n          occasions.\n\n          . . .\n\n          Q. Sir, is now your testimony that you did\n          not say that you had killed or harmed\n          civilians on four different occasions?\n\n          . . .\n\n          A. Unless the officer did not understand the\n          language I tried to explain to him, but I\n          remember the question was raised to me and I\n          answered that I have never participated in the\n          killing of civilians.\n\n          The Petitioner explained that the interview with the\n\nasylum officer was conducted in English, and that he had had a\n\n                              -10-\n\fdifficult time communicating in that interview. Then the following\n\nexchange occurred:\n\n           A.    Sir, did you say and I am quoting\n           “Civilians were in the middle and they had to\n           die?”\n\n           . . .\n\n           Q. Yes, when the question was raised to me, I\n           answered him and said, and tried to explain to\n           him that when there is fighting going on and\n           the civilians are in the middle, they can\n           easily be killed, but I have never told him\n           that I have killed any civilian and I\n           personally have never intentionally killed any\n           civilian.\n\n           Petitioner cites Hartooni v.

He\n\nasserts that the IJ failed in this respect because he limited his\n\nanalysis   of   Petitioner’s    credibility      to    only   one    area,   his\n\ntestimony about whether he had killed civilians, when the whole of\n\nhis testimony was otherwise consistent and believable.\n\n           Hartooni holds that the IJ “must have a legitimate\n\narticulable basis to question the petitioner’s credibility, and\n\nmust offer a specific, cogent reason for any stated disbelief.” 21\n\nF.3d at 342.    As we have heretofore explained, however, the IJ did\n\nprovide a legitimate articulable basis to question the Petitioner’s\n\ncredibility.\n\n           Petitioner also quotes a page from the Basic Law Manual,\n\nproduced by the INS, as authority for the proposition that “a claim\n\n                                   -11-\n\fmay be credible even though the claimant later submits information\n\nnot submitted at the first examination.” U.S. Dep’t of Justice,\n\nImmigration and Naturalization Serv., The Basic Law Manual 105\n\n(1994).   Petitioner alleges that he did not have an interpreter at\n\nthe first examination, which resulted in perceived inconsistencies\n\nwith later interviews in which an interpreter was provided.                        He\n\nasserts his testimony at the removal proceeding was not truly\n\ninconsistent,    but    simply   an   attempt       to   clarify     his   earlier\n\nstatements in a logical and direct manner.\n\n          The discrepancy in Petitioner’s testimony does not simply\n\nreflect information that the Petitioner forgot to include in his\n\nfirst interview, which he is later elaborating or clarifying, as\n\nthe cited passage in the Basic Law Manual appears to contemplate.\n\nIt is an inconsistency in the testimony that makes it plausible,\n\neven likely, that the Petitioner is telling less than the whole\n\ntruth regarding his conduct toward civilians.\n\n          Petitioner also alleges that the inconsistency in his\n\ntestimony was not material because he consistently testified that\n\nhe did not intentionally kill civilians.                  He insists that an\n\ninconsistency must “shut off a line of inquiry which is relevant to\n\nthe alien’s eligibility and which might well have resulted in a\n\nproper determination that he be excluded.”               Matter of Bosuego, 17\n\nI. & N.

But\n\nPetitioner was given an opportunity to respond to the government’s\n\nconcerns about the inconsistent testimony.                    His answers to this\n\nquestioning were not consistent or straightforward.\n\n             We    hold    that   the    IJ’s       credibility    determination       is\n\nsupported by substantial evidence.                  The Petitioner’s testimony was\n\nnot only inconsistent with the testimony he gave at an earlier\n\ninterview, it was inconsistent during the removal hearing itself.\n\nHe at first states, unequivocally, that he killed no civilians\n\nduring his military service.                  He then allows that he may have\n\n“accidentally” killed some.              We would also note, although the IJ\n\nwas not explicit in basing his credibility determination on this\n\npoint, that Petitioner testified that he had no reason to believe\n\nthat   the    Fourth      Division      of    the    UPDF   had   killed     civilians.\n\n\n                                             -13-\n\fHowever, evidence in the record indicated that members of the\n\nFourth Division participated in the lynching of civilians in Gulu\n\nat the time Petitioner was stationed there.          See Aguilar-Solis v.\n\nINS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198342\"><a href=\"/opinion/198342/aguilar-solis-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 570-71 (1st Cir. 1999) (stating that it is not\n\nrequired that “a reviewing court must take every applicant’s\n\nuncontradicted testimony at face value, for testimony is sometimes\n\ninternally inconsistent or belied by prevailing circumstances” and\n\nthat “when a hearing officer who saw and heard a witness makes\n\nadverse credibility determination and supports it with specific\n\nfindings,    an   appellate   court     ordinarily    should   accord   it\n\nsignificant respect”).\n\n            For these reasons, the IJ’s credibility determination\n\nwithstands Petitioner’s challenge.          Having found that adverse\n\ncredibility determination supported by substantial evidence, the\n\nPetitioner did not meet his burden of showing that the persecution-\n\nof-others bar did not apply to him.        Therefore, we will deny the\n\npetition for review.\n\n                                  VI.\n\n            Petitioner argues that the BIA erred in applying 8 C.F.R.\n\n3.1(e) (now 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)), to affirm the result of the IJ’s\n\ndecision without opinion.\n\n            8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(4), the section used by the BIA to\n\naffirm without opinion states, in pertinent part:\n\n            Affirmance without opinion. (I) The Board\n            member to whom a case is assigned shall affirm\n\n                                 -14-\n\f          the decision of the Service or the immigration\n          judge, without opinion, if the Board member\n          determines that the result reached in the\n          decision under review was correct; that any\n          errors in the decision under review were\n          harmless or nonmaterial; and that\n\n          (A) The issues on appeal are squarely\n          controlled by existing Board or federal court\n          precedent and do not involve the application\n          of precedent to a novel factual situation; or\n          (B) The factual and legal issues raised on\n          appeal are not so substantial that the case\n          warrants the issuance of a written opinion in\n          the case.\n\n          Petitioner asserts that the IJ’s decision was not in\n\nconformity with the law or applicable precedents and was the result\n\nof clearly erroneous factual determinations.       It is a subject of\n\nsome debate whether we may review the BIA’s decision to apply the\n\nstreamlining regulation, itself.       See Albathani, 318 F.3d at 378\n\n(“Were there evidence of systemic violation by the BIA of its\n\nregulations, this would be a different case.    We would then have to\n\nface, inter alia, the INS’s claim that the decision to streamline\n\nan immigration appeal is not reviewable by the courts because these\n\nare matters committed to agency discretion.”). Because we conclude\n\nthat the IJ’s credibility determination is clearly supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence, the Petitioner failed to meet his burden of\n\nshowing his “refugee” status.      Therefore, we shall dispose of\n\nPetitioner’s argument without deciding whether we may review the\n\nBIA’s decision to apply the streamlining regulation.\n\n          The petition for review is DENIED.\n\n\n                                -15-\n\f</pre>",
