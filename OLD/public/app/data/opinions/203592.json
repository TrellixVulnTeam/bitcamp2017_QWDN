Nathaniel M. Gorton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n                        Lynch, Chief Judge,\n                Boudin and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Scott A. Lathrop with whom Scott A. Lathrop & Associates was\non brief for appellant.\n     Kevin S. McDermott, Assistant General Counsel, MBTA Law\nDepartment,   for   appellee  Massachusetts   Bay   Transportation\nAuthority.\n     John F. McMahon with whom Angoff, Goldman, Manning, Wanger &\nHynes, P.C. was on brief for appellee Boston Carmen's Union, Local\n589.\n\n\n\n                        December 16, 2008\n\f          Per Curiam. Paula D. Casamento appeals from the judgment\n\nof the district court in her law suit against her employer, the\n\nMassachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (\"MBTA\"), and her union,\n\nBoston Carmen's Union, Local 589 (\"Local 589\").     The central claim\n\nis one of gender discrimination.       Most of the relevant facts are\n\nundisputed and easily recited.\n\n          Casamento was hired by the MBTA as a bus driver in the\n\nwinter of 1984 and became a member of Local 589.      In 1997, due to\n\nmedical problems precluding her from driving a bus, Casamento moved\n\nto a position in the MBTA's revenue collection department.         On\n\nOctober 22, 2002, the MBTA posted a notice that a managerial\n\nposition--Supervisor of Revenue Sales Operations--was available to\n\nbe filled, and Casamento applied.\n\n          Ten other applicants sought the position including one\n\nother woman.   On June 23, 2003, before anyone was interviewed,\n\nSusan Wolfson, the MBTA's Director of Revenue, informed all the\n\napplicants that the posting of the job was rescinded.      The stated\n\nreasons for the position not being filled were primarily budget\n\nconstraints and because a new automated fare system might affect\n\nstaffing requirements.\n\n          In July 2003, Casamento complained that contrary to\n\nWolfson's announcement, a co-worker, Ralph Schlueter, had in fact\n\nbeen awarded the advertised position.        Casamento was told that\n\nSchlueter had not been given the position but remained in the same\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fpost he had filled within the Revenue Department for the prior\n\nthirteen years.        Unconvinced, Casamento filed a grievance with\n\nLocal 589 alleging gender discrimination.\n\n            The union declined to act, saying (among other things)\n\nthat the supervisor job sought by Casamento was not part of                  Local\n\n589's bargaining unit.        Casamento then filed a charge of gender\n\ndiscrimination against the MBTA with the Massachusetts Commission\n\nAgainst    Discrimination     (\"MCAD\"),      which    dismissed     the   charge,\n\nfinding no evidence to support it.               Casamento also filed claims\n\nagainst both the MBTA and Local 589 before the Equal Employment\n\nOpportunity Commission, which granted her a right to sue letter.\n\n            Casamento    then      filed   the    present     law   suit.        The\n\ncomplaint, as amended, charged both the MBTA and the union with\n\ngender discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights\n\nAct of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e (2000) et seq.                In due course, the\n\ndistrict   court   granted      summary    judgment    for    defendants:        even\n\npositing that Casamento had made out a prima facie case warranting\n\nan explanation by defendants, McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411\n\nU.S. 792, 802 (1973), the court ultimately found no evidence of\n\ngender discrimination.\n\n            Casamento now seeks review.           In Casamento's favor is the\n\nfact that the district judge refused to decide on summary judgment\n\nwhether    Schleuter    was   in    fact   performing    the    duties      of   the\n\npreviously posted position; this may have been properly cautious\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fsince the MBTA said that Schleuter's own longstanding job covered\n\nsome of the same duties as the posted position, although it said\n\nthat his pay and title had not been changed after the job listing\n\nwas rescinded and that he continued in his original position.\n\n          In all events, a prima facie case is merely a mechanical\n\nshowing that requires the employer (or, arguably, the union) to\n\ncome forward with an explanation for its decision--which both the\n\nMBTA and union did.     At this point, \"the presumption raised by the\n\nprima facie case is rebutted,” Tex. Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v.\n\nBurdine, 450 U.S. 248, 255 (1981), and “drops from the case,” id.,\n\nat 255 n.10, and it is up to the complainant to show that a\n\nforbidden motive was at work.     St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509\n\nU.S. 502, 508 (1993).    To reach a jury, there must be evidence that\n\nwould permit a jury to so conclude.       Id.\n\n          Here, there was no evidence that gender discrimination\n\nmotivated the MBTA's action.     Whether or not Schlueter was already\n\nperforming some of the functions of the advertised job and whether\n\nor not this played a role in the MBTA's decision to rescind the\n\nposition, no evidence suggested that the posting was withdrawn\n\nbecause   of   gender   discrimination;    indeed,   nothing   directly\n\ncontradicts the MBTA's original claim that budget concerns and the\n\nadvent of automatic fare collection made it reasonable not to go\n\nforward with a new management appointment at that time.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\f             Nor does it furnish evidence of gender discrimination to\n\nassume (as the district judge admittedly did) that the MBTA's\n\nexplanation could be regarded as \"pretext\" if Schlueter were now\n\noccupying the posted job.          Possibly in some contexts a showing of\n\na false explanation can add weight to a discrimination claim\n\nsupported by evidence; but it is hard to imagine such a case where\n\nthere is no evidence of a discriminatory motive in the first place;\n\nand,    if   an   exception   to   this   generalization   can   possibly   be\n\nimagined, it is certainly not this case.\n\n             The case against the union is equally hopeless.                In\n\naddition to its proscription against gender discrimination by\n\nemployers, Title VII renders it unlawful for \"a labor organization\n\n. . . to discriminate against[] any individual because of . . .\n\nsex.\"    42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(c)(1).          A union will be found to have\n\nviolated Title VII when \"it deliberately declines to pursue a\n\nmember's claim because of the member's gender.\"              Beck v. United\n\nFood & Comm. Workers Union, Local 99, 506 F.3d 874, 882 (9th Cir.\n\n2007).\n\n             Once again, there is no evidence in this case of gender\n\ndiscrimination.        The union explained its refusal to pursue a\n\ngrievance on behalf of Casamento, giving colorable reasons entirely\n\nunrelated to the fact that she is a woman.                 Nothing to which\n\nCasamento points suggests that its given reasons were false, let\n\nalone that the true underlying reason was gender discrimination on\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fthe part of the union.   No court could send such a case to trial\n\nbecause there was nothing to be tried.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -6-\n\f",
