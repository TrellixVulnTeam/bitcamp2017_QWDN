Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, Inc.\n\n(“Wells Fargo”), appeals from a district court order denying an\n\nappeal from a determination of the United States Bankruptcy Court\n\nfor the District of Massachusetts. The bankruptcy court denied two\n\nmotions filed by appellant: (1) a motion to approve a stipulation\n\nbetween Wells Fargo and the debtor, Phillippe Charles (“Charles”);\n\nand,       (2)   an    “assented   to”   motion    to   enjoin   the   debtor   from\n\nencumbering certain real property located at 33 Wellington Hill\n\nStreet, Mattapan, Massachusetts, and to vacate a previously entered\n\ndischarge order as it pertained to Wells Fargo’s interest in the\n\nMattapan realty.           We affirm.\n\n                                           I.\n\n                 In April 1996, Charles filed a voluntary Chapter 13\n\npetition.1        An order confirming the debtor’s Chapter 13 plan was\n\nentered by the bankruptcy court on July 31, 1997.                        Under the\n\nconfirmed plan, Charles was to make monthly payments to the Chapter\n\n13 trustee.           A portion of each payment was to be applied toward the\n\nsecured claim held by Lehman Capital Corporation (“Lehman”), Wells\n\nFargo’s predecessor in interest.                Lehman’s claim was secured by a\n\nmortgage on the Mattapan realty.                Also, the debtor was to make a\n\nfinal “balloon” payment to Lehman. The order provided in pertinent\n\npart:\n\n\n\n\n       1\n           See 11 U.S.C. §§ 1301-1330.\n\n                                          -2-\n\f                d) Debtor shall make payments totaling\n           $97,350 to the Trustee, which shall constitute\n           payments toward the secured claim of Lehman\n           Capital Corporation.     Debtor shall make a\n           final “balloon payment” in the exact amount of\n           $64,565.40 (or such other amount as may be\n           hereafter stipulated to between the parties\n           and approved by this Court). This payment may\n           be made directly by debtor to creditor and is\n           not required to be paid through the Chapter 13\n           Trustee.   Trustee must receive evidence of\n           this “balloon” payment from Debtor and\n           confirmation of payment from Creditor before\n           Debtor will be deemed to have fully [complied]\n           with this provision of this Order. No Order\n           for Discharge shall otherwise enter.\n\n                e) Upon the entry of an Order of\n           Discharge under 11 USC Section 1328, the\n           discharge so entered shall constitute a\n           discharge of the above referenced secured\n           mortgage claim.\n\nOrder of Confirmation, C.A. No. 96-12305-JNF (Bankr. D. Mass. July\n\n31, 1997).\n\n           In June 2001, after Charles failed to make the final\n\nballoon payment in accordance with the confirmation order, Wells\n\nFargo filed a motion for relief from the automatic stay and for\n\nleave to foreclose the mortgage on the Mattapan realty. The motion\n\nwas granted on July 3, 2001.          Charles then filed a motion for\n\nreconsideration of the July 3 order and a motion to refinance the\n\nMattapan property.\n\n             In October 2001, during the pendency of the debtor’s\n\nmotions,   Charles    and   Wells   Fargo   entered   into   a   stipulation\n\npertaining     to   Charles’   outstanding    obligation.        Under   the\n\nstipulation, Charles was to refinance the Mattapan realty on or\n\n                                    -3-\n\fbefore November 17, 2001.     From the proceeds of the refinancing,\n\n$71,000.00 was to be remitted to Wells Fargo in full satisfaction\n\nof Charles’ obligation to the company.\n\n           The refinancing transaction was closed on October 29,\n\n2001.    The debtor’s attorney, Michael G. McDonald (“McDonald”),\n\nserved as settlement agent for the new mortgage lender, Long Beach\n\nMortgage Company.      Although McDonald retained $71,000.00 of the\n\nloan proceeds for the purpose of disbursing those funds to Wells\n\nFargo, he failed to do so.\n\n           On or about April 15, 2002, more than five months after\n\nthe closing, McDonald tendered a check, drawn on either his client\n\ntrust or business account,2 in the amount of $71,000.00 to Wells\n\nFargo.   The   check   subsequently   was   dishonored   by   the   drawee\n\nfinancial institution for the reason that there were insufficient\n\nfunds in the account.\n\n           On May 1, 2002, Charles, through McDonald, filed a motion\n\nto vacate the bankruptcy court’s July 3, 2001 order granting Wells\n\nFargo relief from the automatic stay.       The motion was assented to\n\non Wells Fargo’s behalf by its attorney, who, apparently, lacked\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      It is unclear from the record whether following settlement of\nthe refinancing transaction McDonald deposited and maintained the\n$71,000.00 in his client trust account. That issue is not before\nus for determination.     However, we note that Rule 1.15 of the\nMassachusetts Rules of Professional Conduct requires that a lawyer\nmaintain funds belonging to clients or third parties in a trust\naccount, separate from the attorney’s own funds.\n\n                                  -4-\n\fknowledge     of   the   check’s   dishonor.3     The     motion    provided   in\n\npertinent part:\n\n            1.    The Debtor[’]s counsel has provided\n            Shapiro and Kreisman [Wells Fargo’s counsel]\n            with a check in the amount of $71,000.00 for\n            the balloon payment of the bankruptcy.\n\n            2.   The Debtor has therefore completed it’s\n            [sic] debt to the creditor Wells Fargo in full\n            according to the Confirmed Chapter 13 Plan for\n            bankruptcy.\n\nC.A. No. 96-12305-JNF (Bankr. D. Mass. May 1, 2002).                  On May 3,\n\n2002, the bankruptcy court granted the motion and vacated its July\n\n3, 2001 order.\n\n            On June 21, 2002, the Chapter 13 trustee submitted a\n\nreport and accounting and requested the debtor’s discharge.                     An\n\norder discharging Charles was entered on that same date.                       The\n\ntrustee’s final report and account was filed on August 12, 2002.\n\nThe trustee was discharged on September 16, 2002.            As of that date,\n\nWells Fargo had not provided the bankruptcy court with notice that\n\nthe debtor’s obligation had not been satisfied.\n\n            Thereafter, on September 19, 2002, Wells Fargo requested\n\na   hearing    “relative     to    Debtor’s     failure    to      satisfy   plan\n\nobligations” and “for determination of manner in which outstanding\n\n\n\n     3\n      Wells Fargo received notification of the check’s dishonor on\nor before May 7, 2002.      However, according to the company’s\nattorney, that information was not communicated by Well Fargo’s\ncashiering department to its bankruptcy department, or to its\ncounsel, until late-June 2002, following entry of the bankruptcy\ncourt’s June 21, 2002 debtor discharge order.\n\n                                      -5-\n\fobligations     will   be    satisfied.”         By   that     date,       McDonald    had\n\ntendered a second check which had also been dishonored.\n\n           A hearing was conducted by the bankruptcy court on\n\nNovember 14, 2002.           McDonald appeared as counsel for Charles.\n\nMcDonald   represented       to   the   court     that       funds,    including       the\n\n$71,000.00 in refinancing proceeds that were designated for payment\n\nto Wells Fargo, had been misappropriated from his client trust and\n\nbusiness accounts during his extended absence from his law office.4\n\n           At    the    hearing,     McDonald         told    the     court    that     he\n\npersonally    planned       to   satisfy   the    Wells       Fargo    obligation       by\n\nrefinancing     some   commercial       property      and     that    he    anticipated\n\ncompleting the process within 45 to 60 days.                     Counsel for Wells\n\nFargo agreed to provide McDonald with 60 days within which to\n\nsatisfy the outstanding obligation.              The court directed counsel to\n\nsubmit a proposed order reflecting that agreement.\n\n             On November 14, apparently following the hearing, Wells\n\nFargo filed its “assented to” motion to enjoin the debtor from\n\nencumbering the Mattapan property and to vacate the discharge order\n\nas it pertained to Wells Fargo’s interest in the realty.                          Wells\n\nFargo sought the requested relief pending satisfaction of the\n\noutstanding     obligation.         McDonald     assented       to    the     motion    on\n\nCharles’ behalf.       The bankruptcy court scheduled a hearing on the\n\n\n\n     4\n      McDonald cited his spouse’s death and his own serious illness\nas the reason for his absence.\n\n                                        -6-\n\fmotion for November 20, 2002.\n\n     On the day of hearing on the motion to enjoin/vacate, Wells\n\nFargo filed the second motion at issue in the instant appeal, the\n\nmotion to approve a stipulation between Wells Fargo and Charles.\n\nThe stipulation was signed by McDonald on Charles’ behalf and\n\nprovided, in pertinent part:\n\n          1. Debtor’s counsel, Michael McDonald, shall\n          complete payment to Wells Fargo Home Mortgage,\n          Inc[.] (“Wells”) of $71,000 within 60 days of\n          the date hereof.\n          . . .\n          3.   Debtor agrees that from the date hereof\n          until the date of satisfaction of the\n          obligation to Wells through payment of funds\n          referred to above, debtor and anyone acting on\n          his behalf or at his direction shall not\n          undertake to transfer, encumber or otherwise\n          diminish the interest held by debtor in the\n          property that is the subject of the payment\n          obligation referred to above, 33 Wellington\n          Hill Street, Mattapan, Massachusetts.\n\nC.A. No. 96-12305-JNF (Bankr. D. Mass. Nov. 20, 2002).\n\n          During the November 20, 2002 hearing, Charles stated\n\nthat, up until that hearing, he had been unaware that McDonald had\n\nnot satisfied the Wells Fargo obligation.   Further, Charles denied\n\nthat he had authorized McDonald to execute the stipulation on his\n\nbehalf.\n\n          Under oath, McDonald admitted that he had not consulted\n\nwith Charles before assenting to either the motion to enjoin/vacate\n\nor to the stipulation.   Moreover, contrary to the representation\n\nthat he had made to the court during the November 14 hearing,\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fMcDonald acknowledged that he had never informed Charles that the\n\n$71,000.00 obligation had not been satisfied.\n\n            The bankruptcy judge determined that Charles’ assertion\n\nthat he had no knowledge of the non-satisfaction of the Wells Fargo\n\nobligation was credible.           The court denied both the motion to\n\nenjoin/vacate and the motion to approve the stipulation. The court\n\nstated: “Clearly . . . Mr. McDonald had no authority from Mr.\n\nCharles to sign those.       They were inconsistent–they were not just\n\ninconsistent.        They   were   patently    opposed   to   Mr.   Charles’s\n\ninterests.”\n\n            Wells Fargo appealed the bankruptcy court’s denial of the\n\nmotions to the district court.              On June 2, 2003, the district\n\ncourt, concluding that the bankruptcy court had not abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying either motion, denied the appeal.                     This\n\nappeal followed.\n\n                                      II.\n\n            On appeal, we directly review the bankruptcy court’s\n\ndecision.      In re Watman, 301 F.3d 3, 7 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n            The issue presented for our determination is a narrow\n\none: Whether the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in denying\n\nthe   motion    to   enjoin/vacate    and     the   motion   to   approve   the\n\nstipulation.      See In re Weinstein, 164 F.3d 677, 686 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).\n\n            The bankruptcy court premised its denial of both motions\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fon its determination that Charles had not assented to either motion\n\nand that the relief sought in the unauthorized motions was contrary\n\nto the debtor’s best interests.          We examine the bankruptcy court’s\n\nfactual findings for clear error and review its conclusions of law\n\nde novo.    In re Watman, 301 F.3d at 7.\n\n            The bankruptcy court’s finding that the debtor had not\n\nauthorized McDonald to execute the motions on his behalf is amply\n\nsupported by the record.        Charles denied knowing that the Wells\n\nFargo obligation had not been satisfied and asserted that he had\n\nneither seen nor assented to the pleadings in issue.           The debtor’s\n\nrepresentations     to   the   court   were   corroborated   by     McDonald’s\n\ntestimony    that   he   had   neither    informed   his   client    that   the\n\nobligation had not been satisfied nor obtained Charles’ authority\n\nto assent to Wells Fargo’s motion to enjoin/vacate or to agree on\n\nCharles’ behalf to Wells Fargo’s proposed stipulation.\n\n            Further, the bankruptcy court’s determination that the\n\nrelief sought by Wells Fargo through the motions was contrary to\n\nCharles’ interests is clearly supported by the record.              The debtor\n\npreviously had obtained a discharge of his obligation to Wells\n\nFargo.     In furtherance of that objective, Charles had refinanced\n\nthe Mattapan property, thereby incurring additional indebtedness\n\nand an additional encumbrance on the realty.           McDonald acquired a\n\nportion of the loan proceeds, $71,000.00, in trust, for payment to\n\nWells Fargo but, in contravention of his obligations under Rule\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\f1.15(b) of the Massachusetts Rules of Professional Conduct, failed\n\nto promptly deliver those funds to the company.          The motions, if\n\ngranted,   would   have   prohibited    Charles   from   encumbering   or\n\ntransferring the Mattapan realty until such time as McDonald\n\nsatisfied his obligations to Wells Fargo.          Further, the result\n\nsought by Wells Fargo and purportedly agreed to by Charles would\n\nhave deprived the debtor of the benefits of the discharge order\n\npreviously entered by the bankruptcy court.\n\n           Because the bankruptcy court’s findings that the motions\n\nwere not authorized by the debtor and that they were contrary to\n\nhis best interests were not clearly erroneous, the bankruptcy court\n\ndid not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to enjoin/vacate\n\nand the motion to approve the stipulation on that basis.5\n\n                                 III.\n\n           For the above reasons, we uphold both the bankruptcy\n\ncourt’s denial of the motions and the district court’s affirmance\n\nof that decision.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      Wells Fargo’s assertion to the contrary notwithstanding,\nwhether the debtor had complied with the confirmation plan was not\nan issue before the bankruptcy court for determination on November\n20, 2002 and, accordingly, is not before this court for\nconsideration on appeal.\n\n                                 -10-\n\f",

Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, Inc.\n\n(“Wells Fargo”), appeals from a district court order denying an\n\nappeal from a determination of the United States Bankruptcy Court\n\nfor the District of Massachusetts. The bankruptcy court denied two\n\nmotions filed by appellant: (1) a motion to approve a stipulation\n\nbetween Wells Fargo and the debtor, Phillippe Charles (“Charles”);\n\nand,       (2)   an    “assented   to”   motion    to   enjoin   the   debtor   from\n\nencumbering certain real property located at 33 Wellington Hill\n\nStreet, Mattapan, Massachusetts, and to vacate a previously entered\n\ndischarge order as it pertained to Wells Fargo’s interest in the\n\nMattapan realty.           We affirm.\n\n                                           I.\n\n                 In April 1996, Charles filed a voluntary Chapter 13\n\npetition.1        An order confirming the debtor’s Chapter 13 plan was\n\nentered by the bankruptcy court on July 31, 1997.                        Under the\n\nconfirmed plan, Charles was to make monthly payments to the Chapter\n\n13 trustee.           A portion of each payment was to be applied toward the\n\nsecured claim held by Lehman Capital Corporation (“Lehman”), Wells\n\nFargo’s predecessor in interest.                Lehman’s claim was secured by a\n\nmortgage on the Mattapan realty.                Also, the debtor was to make a\n\nfinal “balloon” payment to Lehman. The order provided in pertinent\n\npart:\n\n\n\n\n       1\n           See 11 U.S.C. §§ 1301-1330.\n\n                                          -2-\n\f                d) Debtor shall make payments totaling\n           $97,350 to the Trustee, which shall constitute\n           payments toward the secured claim of Lehman\n           Capital Corporation.     Debtor shall make a\n           final “balloon payment” in the exact amount of\n           $64,565.40 (or such other amount as may be\n           hereafter stipulated to between the parties\n           and approved by this Court). This payment may\n           be made directly by debtor to creditor and is\n           not required to be paid through the Chapter 13\n           Trustee.   Trustee must receive evidence of\n           this “balloon” payment from Debtor and\n           confirmation of payment from Creditor before\n           Debtor will be deemed to have fully [complied]\n           with this provision of this Order. No Order\n           for Discharge shall otherwise enter.\n\n                e) Upon the entry of an Order of\n           Discharge under 11 USC Section 1328, the\n           discharge so entered shall constitute a\n           discharge of the above referenced secured\n           mortgage claim.\n\nOrder of Confirmation, C.A. No. 96-12305-JNF (Bankr. D. Mass. July\n\n31, 1997).\n\n           In June 2001, after Charles failed to make the final\n\nballoon payment in accordance with the confirmation order, Wells\n\nFargo filed a motion for relief from the automatic stay and for\n\nleave to foreclose the mortgage on the Mattapan realty. The motion\n\nwas granted on July 3, 2001.          Charles then filed a motion for\n\nreconsideration of the July 3 order and a motion to refinance the\n\nMattapan property.\n\n             In October 2001, during the pendency of the debtor’s\n\nmotions,   Charles    and   Wells   Fargo   entered   into   a   stipulation\n\npertaining     to   Charles’   outstanding    obligation.        Under   the\n\nstipulation, Charles was to refinance the Mattapan realty on or\n\n                                    -3-\n\fbefore November 17, 2001.     From the proceeds of the refinancing,\n\n$71,000.00 was to be remitted to Wells Fargo in full satisfaction\n\nof Charles’ obligation to the company.\n\n           The refinancing transaction was closed on October 29,\n\n2001.    The debtor’s attorney, Michael G. McDonald (“McDonald”),\n\nserved as settlement agent for the new mortgage lender, Long Beach\n\nMortgage Company.      Although McDonald retained $71,000.00 of the\n\nloan proceeds for the purpose of disbursing those funds to Wells\n\nFargo, he failed to do so.\n\n           On or about April 15, 2002, more than five months after\n\nthe closing, McDonald tendered a check, drawn on either his client\n\ntrust or business account,2 in the amount of $71,000.00 to Wells\n\nFargo.   The   check   subsequently   was   dishonored   by   the   drawee\n\nfinancial institution for the reason that there were insufficient\n\nfunds in the account.\n\n           On May 1, 2002, Charles, through McDonald, filed a motion\n\nto vacate the bankruptcy court’s July 3, 2001 order granting Wells\n\nFargo relief from the automatic stay.       The motion was assented to\n\non Wells Fargo’s behalf by its attorney, who, apparently, lacked\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      It is unclear from the record whether following settlement of\nthe refinancing transaction McDonald deposited and maintained the\n$71,000.00 in his client trust account. That issue is not before\nus for determination.     However, we note that Rule 1.15 of the\nMassachusetts Rules of Professional Conduct requires that a lawyer\nmaintain funds belonging to clients or third parties in a trust\naccount, separate from the attorney’s own funds.\n\n                                  -4-\n\fknowledge     of   the   check’s   dishonor.3     The     motion    provided   in\n\npertinent part:\n\n            1.    The Debtor[’]s counsel has provided\n            Shapiro and Kreisman [Wells Fargo’s counsel]\n            with a check in the amount of $71,000.00 for\n            the balloon payment of the bankruptcy.\n\n            2.   The Debtor has therefore completed it’s\n            [sic] debt to the creditor Wells Fargo in full\n            according to the Confirmed Chapter 13 Plan for\n            bankruptcy.\n\nC.A. No. 96-12305-JNF (Bankr. D. Mass. May 1, 2002).                  On May 3,\n\n2002, the bankruptcy court granted the motion and vacated its July\n\n3, 2001 order.\n\n            On June 21, 2002, the Chapter 13 trustee submitted a\n\nreport and accounting and requested the debtor’s discharge.                     An\n\norder discharging Charles was entered on that same date.                       The\n\ntrustee’s final report and account was filed on August 12, 2002.\n\nThe trustee was discharged on September 16, 2002.            As of that date,\n\nWells Fargo had not provided the bankruptcy court with notice that\n\nthe debtor’s obligation had not been satisfied.\n\n            Thereafter, on September 19, 2002, Wells Fargo requested\n\na   hearing    “relative     to    Debtor’s     failure    to      satisfy   plan\n\nobligations” and “for determination of manner in which outstanding\n\n\n\n     3\n      Wells Fargo received notification of the check’s dishonor on\nor before May 7, 2002.      However, according to the company’s\nattorney, that information was not communicated by Well Fargo’s\ncashiering department to its bankruptcy department, or to its\ncounsel, until late-June 2002, following entry of the bankruptcy\ncourt’s June 21, 2002 debtor discharge order.\n\n                                      -5-\n\fobligations     will   be    satisfied.”         By   that     date,       McDonald    had\n\ntendered a second check which had also been dishonored.\n\n           A hearing was conducted by the bankruptcy court on\n\nNovember 14, 2002.           McDonald appeared as counsel for Charles.\n\nMcDonald   represented       to   the   court     that       funds,    including       the\n\n$71,000.00 in refinancing proceeds that were designated for payment\n\nto Wells Fargo, had been misappropriated from his client trust and\n\nbusiness accounts during his extended absence from his law office.4\n\n           At    the    hearing,     McDonald         told    the     court    that     he\n\npersonally    planned       to   satisfy   the    Wells       Fargo    obligation       by\n\nrefinancing     some   commercial       property      and     that    he    anticipated\n\ncompleting the process within 45 to 60 days.                     Counsel for Wells\n\nFargo agreed to provide McDonald with 60 days within which to\n\nsatisfy the outstanding obligation.              The court directed counsel to\n\nsubmit a proposed order reflecting that agreement.\n\n             On November 14, apparently following the hearing, Wells\n\nFargo filed its “assented to” motion to enjoin the debtor from\n\nencumbering the Mattapan property and to vacate the discharge order\n\nas it pertained to Wells Fargo’s interest in the realty.                          Wells\n\nFargo sought the requested relief pending satisfaction of the\n\noutstanding     obligation.         McDonald     assented       to    the     motion    on\n\nCharles’ behalf.       The bankruptcy court scheduled a hearing on the\n\n\n\n     4\n      McDonald cited his spouse’s death and his own serious illness\nas the reason for his absence.\n\n                                        -6-\n\fmotion for November 20, 2002.\n\n     On the day of hearing on the motion to enjoin/vacate, Wells\n\nFargo filed the second motion at issue in the instant appeal, the\n\nmotion to approve a stipulation between Wells Fargo and Charles.\n\nThe stipulation was signed by McDonald on Charles’ behalf and\n\nprovided, in pertinent part:\n\n          1. Debtor’s counsel, Michael McDonald, shall\n          complete payment to Wells Fargo Home Mortgage,\n          Inc[.] (“Wells”) of $71,000 within 60 days of\n          the date hereof.\n          . . .\n          3.   Debtor agrees that from the date hereof\n          until the date of satisfaction of the\n          obligation to Wells through payment of funds\n          referred to above, debtor and anyone acting on\n          his behalf or at his direction shall not\n          undertake to transfer, encumber or otherwise\n          diminish the interest held by debtor in the\n          property that is the subject of the payment\n          obligation referred to above, 33 Wellington\n          Hill Street, Mattapan, Massachusetts.\n\nC.A. No. 96-12305-JNF (Bankr. D. Mass. Nov. 20, 2002).\n\n          During the November 20, 2002 hearing, Charles stated\n\nthat, up until that hearing, he had been unaware that McDonald had\n\nnot satisfied the Wells Fargo obligation.   Further, Charles denied\n\nthat he had authorized McDonald to execute the stipulation on his\n\nbehalf.\n\n          Under oath, McDonald admitted that he had not consulted\n\nwith Charles before assenting to either the motion to enjoin/vacate\n\nor to the stipulation.   Moreover, contrary to the representation\n\nthat he had made to the court during the November 14 hearing,\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fMcDonald acknowledged that he had never informed Charles that the\n\n$71,000.00 obligation had not been satisfied.\n\n            The bankruptcy judge determined that Charles’ assertion\n\nthat he had no knowledge of the non-satisfaction of the Wells Fargo\n\nobligation was credible.           The court denied both the motion to\n\nenjoin/vacate and the motion to approve the stipulation. The court\n\nstated: “Clearly . . . Mr. McDonald had no authority from Mr.\n\nCharles to sign those.       They were inconsistent–they were not just\n\ninconsistent.        They   were   patently    opposed   to   Mr.   Charles’s\n\ninterests.”\n\n            Wells Fargo appealed the bankruptcy court’s denial of the\n\nmotions to the district court.              On June 2, 2003, the district\n\ncourt, concluding that the bankruptcy court had not abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying either motion, denied the appeal.                     This\n\nappeal followed.\n\n                                      II.\n\n            On appeal, we directly review the bankruptcy court’s\n\ndecision.      In re Watman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200092\"><a href=\"/opinion/200092/groman-v-watman/\"><span class=\"volume\">301</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 7 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n            The issue presented for our determination is a narrow\n\none: Whether the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in denying\n\nthe   motion    to   enjoin/vacate    and     the   motion   to   approve   the\n\nstipulation.      See In re Weinstein, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198278\"><a href=\"/opinion/198278/patriot-portfolio-v-weinstein/\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">677</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 686 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).\n\n            The bankruptcy court premised its denial of both motions\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fon its determination that Charles had not assented to either motion\n\nand that the relief sought in the unauthorized motions was contrary\n\nto the debtor’s best interests.          We examine the bankruptcy court’s\n\nfactual findings for clear error and review its conclusions of law\n\nde novo.    In re Watman, 301 F.3d at 7.\n\n            The bankruptcy court’s finding that the debtor had not\n\nauthorized McDonald to execute the motions on his behalf is amply\n\nsupported by the record.        Charles denied knowing that the Wells\n\nFargo obligation had not been satisfied and asserted that he had\n\nneither seen nor assented to the pleadings in issue.           The debtor’s\n\nrepresentations     to   the   court   were   corroborated   by     McDonald’s\n\ntestimony    that   he   had   neither    informed   his   client    that   the\n\nobligation had not been satisfied nor obtained Charles’ authority\n\nto assent to Wells Fargo’s motion to enjoin/vacate or to agree on\n\nCharles’ behalf to Wells Fargo’s proposed stipulation.\n\n            Further, the bankruptcy court’s determination that the\n\nrelief sought by Wells Fargo through the motions was contrary to\n\nCharles’ interests is clearly supported by the record.              The debtor\n\npreviously had obtained a discharge of his obligation to Wells\n\nFargo.     In furtherance of that objective, Charles had refinanced\n\nthe Mattapan property, thereby incurring additional indebtedness\n\nand an additional encumbrance on the realty.           McDonald acquired a\n\nportion of the loan proceeds, $71,000.00, in trust, for payment to\n\nWells Fargo but, in contravention of his obligations under Rule\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\f1.15(b) of the Massachusetts Rules of Professional Conduct, failed\n\nto promptly deliver those funds to the company.          The motions, if\n\ngranted,   would   have   prohibited    Charles   from   encumbering   or\n\ntransferring the Mattapan realty until such time as McDonald\n\nsatisfied his obligations to Wells Fargo.          Further, the result\n\nsought by Wells Fargo and purportedly agreed to by Charles would\n\nhave deprived the debtor of the benefits of the discharge order\n\npreviously entered by the bankruptcy court.\n\n           Because the bankruptcy court’s findings that the motions\n\nwere not authorized by the debtor and that they were contrary to\n\nhis best interests were not clearly erroneous, the bankruptcy court\n\ndid not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to enjoin/vacate\n\nand the motion to approve the stipulation on that basis.5\n\n                                 III.\n\n           For the above reasons, we uphold both the bankruptcy\n\ncourt’s denial of the motions and the district court’s affirmance\n\nof that decision.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      Wells Fargo’s assertion to the contrary notwithstanding,\nwhether the debtor had complied with the confirmation plan was not\nan issue before the bankruptcy court for determination on November\n20, 2002 and, accordingly, is not before this court for\nconsideration on appeal.\n\n                                 -10-\n\f</pre>",
