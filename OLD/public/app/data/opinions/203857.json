Jay A. Garcia-Gregory, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                         Lynch, Chief Judge,\n                Farris* and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Luis F.

Residents of three public housing\n\ncomplexes brought a civil rights suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n\nagainst the Mayor of Barceloneta, Puerto Rico, protesting the\n\nprecipitous seizures and cruel killings of their pet cats and dogs.\n\nThe twenty named plaintiff families assert violations of their\n\nFourth Amendment rights to be free from unreasonable seizures of\n\ntheir \"effects\" and their Fourteenth Amendment procedural and\n\nsubstantive due process rights.\n\n           The pets were taken in two successive raids, within ten\n\ndays of the Municipality of Barceloneta assuming control of the\n\npublic housing complexes from the Puerto Rico Public Housing\n\nAdministration (\"PRPHA\") on October 1, 2007.      Plaintiffs allege\n\nthat before that transfer, they had been permitted to have their\n\npets.   Only a few days before the raids, the residents were told to\n\nsurrender their pets on pain of being evicted from their homes.\n\nThey allege that after many of the pets were seized, the pets were\n\nkilled by slamming them into the sides of vans and by hurling the\n\nsurvivors off a 50-foot-high bridge.     Some plaintiffs eventually\n\nfound their family pets dead under the bridge.\n\n           The Mayor, in his personal capacity, moved to dismiss all\n\ndamages claims against him on grounds of qualified immunity.   That\n\nmotion was denied; the Mayor has taken an interlocutory appeal.\n\nThis court denied the Mayor's motion to stay proceedings in the\n\n\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fdistrict court.     We are informed that discovery is being completed\n\nand that the case is nearly ready for trial.\n\n           We affirm the denial of the Mayor's motion for qualified\n\nimmunity     on   the   Fourth   Amendment   and   Fourteenth   Amendment\n\nprocedural due process claims.        Applying the Supreme Court's new\n\ndecision in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, No. 07-1015, ___ S. Ct. ___, 2009 WL\n\n1361536 (May 18, 2009), we reverse the denial of qualified immunity\n\nto the Mayor as to the plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment substantive\n\ndue process claims and order those claims dismissed.             We also\n\nrevise our prior circuit law on the steps to follow in the\n\nqualified immunity analysis in light of superceding Supreme Court\n\nprecedent.\n\n                                    I.\n\n           On interlocutory appeal from the denial of qualified\n\nimmunity through a motion to dismiss, \"we must take all the factual\n\nallegations in the complaint as true.\"       Iqbal, 2009 WL 1361536, at\n\n*13.   Yet we need not accept as true legal conclusions from the\n\ncomplaint or \"'naked assertion[s]' devoid of 'further factual\n\nenhancement.'\"     Id. at *12 (alteration in original) (quoting Bell\n\nAtl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 557 (2007)).\n\n           The Municipality assumed operational control over three\n\npublic housing complexes in Barceloneta from the PRPHA on October\n\n1, 2007. Between October 3 and 7, 2007, the Municipality delivered\n\nnotices to residents of those complexes that it would be enforcing\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fa pet policy, which prohibited the residents from having cats or\n\ndogs.    The notices threatened eviction for those who did not\n\nsurrender their pets and included an English-language copy of the\n\npet policy, but not a Spanish-language version.            The residents of\n\nthose complexes are predominantly Spanish speakers.             Plaintiffs\n\nallege   that   few   speak,   read,    or   write   English.   Before   the\n\nMunicipality took control of the housing complexes, residents had\n\nkept pets with the knowledge and consent of the housing complexes'\n\nadministrators, and there was no enforced prohibition on the\n\nownership of a cat or dog.\n\n            On October 8, 2007, without any further notice to the\n\nresidents, uniformed municipal employees and workers from Animal\n\nControl Solutions, Inc. (\"ACS\"), a private contractor hired by the\n\nMunicipality, arrived at the three public housing complexes and\n\nviolently captured numerous pet cats and dogs.           They went door-to-\n\ndoor and demanded that the residents give up their pets or face\n\neviction.   Many people complied.        Some residents who were not home\n\nat the time had their pets taken from inside their enclosed patios\n\nand laundry areas.        Municipal employees and ACS workers also\n\ncaptured several pets that were in the common areas of the housing\n\nproject, even taking pets away from children.           The Mayor and other\n\nhigh ranking municipal officials were present that day at least at\n\none of the housing complexes while the animals were seized.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f            Once the pets were captured, municipal employees and ACS\n\nworkers injected some of the animals with an unknown substance.\n\nThey also slammed the animals against the side of a van, causing\n\nsome witnesses to believe that their pets had been killed in their\n\npresence.       Those animals surviving the initial trauma were then\n\nthrown to their deaths off a 50-foot-high bridge, known as El Paseo\n\nde Indio (\"The Indian Walk\").               Some residents eventually found\n\ntheir pets dead underneath the bridge.\n\n            Similar raids occurred two days later at each of the\n\nthree housing complexes, also resulting in the cruel killings of\n\nthe residents' animals. There is no claim that the defendant Mayor\n\nwas present at these raids.             The residents protested.         On October\n\n17,     2007,    the    Municipality       resigned     its    position    as   the\n\nadministrator of the public housing complexes in Barceloneta.\n\n            On October 19, 2007, the residents sued the Mayor and\n\nother    municipal      officials   under        42   U.S.C.   §   1983,   claiming\n\nviolations      of     their   rights    under    the   Fourth     and   Fourteenth\n\nAmendments, as well as under other federal and state laws that are\n\nnot involved in this appeal.              The complaint sought, inter alia,\n\npunitive damages and compensatory damages of at least $1500 for the\n\nvalue of each pet and $500,000 for the harm inflicted on each\n\nplaintiff, as well as injunctive and declaratory relief.\n\n            On April 29, 2008, the Mayor moved to dismiss all the\n\ndamage claims against him, asserting qualified immunity.                   On July\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\f29, 2008, the district court issued an opinion and order denying\n\nthe   Mayor    qualified   immunity     on    the   plaintiffs'    Fourth   and\n\nFourteenth Amendment claims.1         This interlocutory appeal from the\n\ndistrict court's denial of qualified immunity followed.\n\n                                      II.\n\nA.            Appellate Jurisdiction over Denials of Qualified Immunity\n\n              An order rejecting a public official's qualified immunity\n\ndefense is immediately appealable as a \"final\" judgment within the\n\nmeaning of 28 U.S.C. § 1291 to the extent that it turns on an issue\n\nof law.    Iqbal, 2009 WL 1361536, at *8 (\"[T]his court has been\n\ncareful to say that a district court's order rejecting qualified\n\nimmunity at the motion-to-dismiss stage of a proceeding is a 'final\n\ndecision' within the meaning of § 1291.\"); Behrens v. Pelletier,\n\n516 U.S. 299, 306-07 (1996); Bergeron v. Cabral, 560 F.3d 1, 5 (1st\n\nCir. 2009).      That is, \"when the district court assumes a set of\n\nfacts favorable to the plaintiff and decides as a matter of law\n\nthat those facts do not form a satisfactory basis for a finding of\n\nqualified immunity, an interlocutory appeal is available under the\n\ncollateral order doctrine.\"      Bergeron, 560 F.3d at 6.\n\n              Here, we have jurisdiction to consider the Mayor's legal\n\nargument      that   the   plaintiffs        have   not   stated   cognizable\n\n\n      1\n          The Mayor also moved to dismiss for failure to state a\nclaim, which the district court granted as to a few claims, but\ndenied as to the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment claims and pendent\nstate law claims. That order was not appealable and is not before\nus.\n\n                                      -6-\n\fconstitutional violations, accepting the facts alleged in the\n\ncomplaint as true. We also have jurisdiction to decide whether the\n\nconstitutional      rights   that    the    Mayor    allegedly     violated     were\n\nclearly established at the time.                But we do not at this stage in\n\nthe   litigation      have     jurisdiction         to    decide      whether    any\n\nconstitutional violations actually occurred or to resolve any\n\nfactual disputes necessary to make that determination.\n\n            Assessing qualified immunity at the motion to dismiss\n\nstage requires that we evaluate the sufficiency of the plaintiffs'\n\npleadings.        Indeed,    because      \"whether    a   particular     complaint\n\nsufficiently alleges a clearly established violation of law cannot\n\nbe decided in isolation from the facts pleaded,\" Iqbal, 2009 WL\n\n1361536, at *9, we must scrutinize the plaintiffs' complaint to\n\ndetermine whether it states a plausible entitlement to relief.\n\n            Two underlying principles guide our assessment of the\n\nadequacy of the plaintiffs' pleadings.               \"First, the tenet that a\n\ncourt must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a\n\ncomplaint    is    inapplicable     to     legal    conclusions.        Threadbare\n\nrecitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere\n\nconclusory   statements,      do    not    suffice.\"       Id.   at   *13   (citing\n\nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 555).           Such conclusory statements are \"not\n\nentitled to the assumption of truth.\"               Id.\n\n            \"Second, only a complaint that states a plausible claim\n\nfor relief survives a motion to dismiss.\" Id. (citing Twombly, 550\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fU.S. at 556).        This second principle recognizes that the court's\n\nassessment of the pleadings is \"context-specific,\" requiring \"the\n\nreviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common\n\nsense.\"     Id.     \"[W]here the well-pleaded facts do not permit the\n\ncourt to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the\n\ncomplaint has alleged -- but it has not 'show[n]' -- 'that the\n\npleader   is      entitled   to    relief.'\"       Id.   (second   alteration     in\n\noriginal) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).\n\nB.          The Qualified Immunity Doctrine\n\n            The qualified immunity doctrine provides defendant public\n\nofficials      an   immunity      from   suit    and   not   a   mere   defense   to\n\nliability.        Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 526 (1985).                  For\n\nthis reason, immunity is to be resolved at the earliest possible\n\nstage in litigation.         Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U.S. 224, 227 (1991).\n\nIn some cases, the doctrine ensures that insubstantial claims\n\nagainst government officials will be resolved before discovery.\n\nAnderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640, n.2 (1987).                      Indeed,\n\n\"[t]he basic thrust of the qualified immunity doctrine is to free\n\nofficials from the concerns of litigation, including 'avoidance of\n\ndisruptive discovery.'\"            Iqbal, 2009 WL 1361536, at *16 (quoting\n\nSiegert   v.      Gilley,    500    U.S.    226,   236   (1991)    (Kennedy,      J.,\n\nconcurring in judgment)).\n\n\n\n\n                                           -8-\n\f           1.        Qualified Immunity: A Two-Step Analysis\n\n           The Supreme Court's most recent rulings on qualified\n\nimmunity provide clarification on several points and require some\n\nrevision of the nomenclature and steps this circuit has previously\n\nused.\n\n           In Pearson v. Callahan, 129 S. Ct. 808 (2009), the Court\n\nreiterated that the qualified immunity inquiry is a two-part test.\n\nA court must decide: (1) whether the facts alleged or shown by the\n\nplaintiff make out a violation of a constitutional right; and (2)\n\nif so, whether the right was \"clearly established\" at the time of\n\nthe defendant's alleged violation.           Id. at 815-16.    The Supreme\n\nCourt has often described the analysis as a two-step test.              See,\n\ne.g., id. at 815; Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 377 (2007);\n\nBrosseau v. Haugen, 543 U.S. 194, 195 (2004) (per curiam); Chavez\n\nv. Martinez, 538 U.S. 760, 766 (2003); Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S.\n\n194, 201 (2001), overruled in part by Pearson, 129 S. Ct. 808.\n\n           It is clear from the Supreme Court's description of the\n\nsecond,   \"clearly    established\"    step   of   the   qualified   immunity\n\nanalysis that the second step, in turn, has two aspects.                 One\n\naspect of the analysis focuses on the clarity of the law at the\n\ntime of the alleged civil rights violation.         To overcome qualified\n\nimmunity, \"[t]he contours of the right must be sufficiently clear\n\nthat a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing\n\nviolates that right.\"     Anderson, 483 U.S. at 640.       The other aspect\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\ffocuses more concretely on the facts of the particular case and\n\nwhether a reasonable defendant would have understood that his\n\nconduct violated the plaintiffs' constitutional rights.                          Indeed,\n\n\"[i]t    is    important     to   emphasize         that    this   inquiry      'must   be\n\nundertaken in light of the specific context of the case, not as a\n\nbroad general proposition.'\"              Brosseau, 543 U.S. at 198 (quoting\n\nSaucier, 533 U.S. at 201).           Cognizant of both the contours of the\n\nallegedly infringed right and the particular facts of the case,\n\n\"[t]he relevant, dispositive inquiry in determining whether a right\n\nis clearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable\n\nofficer       that   his   conduct   was       unlawful      in    the    situation     he\n\nconfronted.\"         Id. at 199 (quoting Saucier, 533 U.S. at 202)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).                  That is, the salient question\n\nis whether the state of the law at the time of the alleged\n\nviolation gave the defendant fair warning that his particular\n\nconduct was unconstitutional.             See Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730,\n\n741 (2002).\n\n               In administering the Court's test, this circuit has\n\ntended    to    list   separately    the       two    sub-parts     of    the   \"clearly\n\nestablished\" prong along with the first prong and, as a result, has\n\narticulated the qualified immunity test as a three-part test. See,\n\ne.g.,    Bergeron,     560   F.3d    at    7    &    n.2;    Estate      of   Bennett   v.\n\nWainwright, 548 F.3d 155, 167 (1st Cir. 2008); Parker v. Gerrish,\n\n547 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir. 2008); Philip v. Cronin, 537 F.3d 26, 34\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\f(1st Cir. 2008).    While the substance of our three-part test has\n\nbeen faithful to the substance of the Court's two-part test, we owe\n\nfidelity to the Court's articulation of the test as well.          And so\n\nwe now adopt the Court's two-part test and abandon our previous\n\nusage of a three-step analysis.\n\n          This we can do without invoking an en banc court given\n\nthe intervention of the Supreme Court's decision in Pearson.         See\n\nWallace v. Reno, 194 F.3d 279, 283 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"When a panel\n\nof this circuit has decided an issue, another panel will ordinarily\n\nnot revisit that issue; but, of course, this limitation does not\n\napply where an intervening decision of the Supreme Court overturns\n\nor undermines our earlier decision.\").\n\n          2.       It is Permissible to Avoid the First Step of the\n                   Qualified Immunity Analysis\n\n          Pearson also held that while it is frequently appropriate\n\nfor courts to answer each step in turn, it is not mandatory that\n\ncourts follow the two-step analysis sequentially.           Courts have\n\ndiscretion to decide whether, on the facts of a particular case, it\n\nis worthwhile to address first whether the facts alleged make out\n\na violation of a constitutional right.\n\n          As   Pearson   explained,   the   primary   motivation   behind\n\nSaucier's sequential two-step rule was to promote the development\n\nof constitutional precedent.    129 S. Ct. at 816.     Of course, there\n\nmay be instances where \"a discussion of why the relevant facts do\n\nnot violate clearly established law . . . make[s] it apparent that\n\n                                 -11-\n\fin fact the relevant facts do not make out a constitutional\n\nviolation at all,\" id. at 818, making it worthwhile to address the\n\nfirst prong of the qualified immunity analysis.\n\n            But in some cases, discussion of the first prong of the\n\nqualified      immunity   analysis      will   result   \"in    a   substantial\n\nexpenditure of scarce judicial resources on difficult questions\n\nthat have no effect on the outcome of the case.\"                    Id.        This\n\nexpenditure of resources by the courts and the parties is difficult\n\nto justify in cases where the constitutional questions presented\n\nare heavily fact-bound, minimizing their precedential value.                    Id.\n\nat 819.\n\n            Further, the utility of bypassing the first prong is\n\nparticularly apparent \"[w]hen qualified immunity is asserted at the\n\npleading    stage   [because]     the    precise    factual    basis     for    the\n\nplaintiff's claim or claims may be hard to identify.\"              Id.   Indeed,\n\nas this circuit has held, and Pearson recognized, where the answer\n\nto the first prong of the immunity question may depend on the\n\nfurther development of the facts, it may be wise to avoid the first\n\nstep.     See id. (citing Buchanan v. Maine, 469 F.3d 158, 168 (1st\n\nCir. 2006)).     The Mayor here has chosen not to wait, but to press\n\nthe   Fourth    Amendment   and   Fourteenth       Amendment   issues     at    the\n\npleadings stage, and then to appeal, in part, the denial of\n\nqualified immunity on the pleadings.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\f                               III.\n\nA.        Application of Qualified Immunity Analysis to the Fourth\n          Amendment Claim\n\n          The Mayor argues that the complaint fails to state a\n\ncognizable constitutional claim under the Fourth Amendment because\n\nthat Amendment does not provide protection to individuals in their\n\nownership of household pets under these circumstances.   The first\n\npart of the Mayor's argument is essentially that taking plaintiffs'\n\nassertions in the complaint as true, the complaint still fails to\n\nstate a Fourth Amendment claim.\n\n          An individual's interest in his pet cat or dog does fall\n\nwithin the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of unreasonable seizures,\n\nthough we have not addressed the question before.    As the Fourth\n\nCircuit's decision in Altman v. City of High Point, 330 F.3d 194\n\n(4th Cir. 2003), establishes, privately owned pet dogs do qualify\n\nas property, such that pets are \"effects\" under the seizure clause\n\nof the Fourth Amendment.2   Id. at 202-04.   We rely on and do not\n\nrepeat Judge Luttig's scholarly analysis that dogs are \"effects\"\n\nfor purposes of being secure from unreasonable seizure under the\n\nFourth Amendment.\n\n\n     2\n          The Fourth Amendment provides, in relevant part: \"The\nright of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers\nand effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not\nbe violated.\"    U.S. Const. amend. IV.    The Fourth Amendment's\nprohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures applies to Puerto\nRico and to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. See Mapp\nv. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 655 (1961); Martínez-Rivera v. Sánchez\nRamos, 498 F.3d 3, 7 n.4 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n                               -13-\n\f          The    killing   of   a   person's    pet   dog   or   cat   by   the\n\ngovernment without the person's consent is also a seizure within\n\nthe meaning of the Fourth Amendment.            Three other circuits had\n\nannounced this conclusion well before the violations alleged here.\n\nSee Brown v. Muhlenberg Twp., 269 F.3d 205, 210 (3d Cir. 2001);\n\nFuller v. Vines, 36 F.3d 65, 68 (9th Cir. 1994), overruled on other\n\ngrounds by Robinson v. Solano County, 278 F.3d 1007 (9th Cir.\n\n2002); Lesher v. Reed, 12 F.3d 148, 150-51 (8th Cir. 1994).             Since\n\nthen, the Seventh Circuit has also held that the killing of a\n\ncompanion dog is a Fourth Amendment seizure.           See Viilo v. Eyre,\n\n547 F.3d 707, 710 (7th Cir. 2008).             No circuit court has held\n\notherwise.\n\n          We reject the Mayor's argument that this law was not\n\nclearly established because this court had not earlier addressed\n\nthe questions of effects and seizure.             Against the widespread\n\nacceptance of these points in the federal circuit courts, the\n\nMayor's argument fails.     These are principles of law, and the law\n\nwas sufficiently recognized by courts to be clearly established.\n\nSee Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603, 617 (1999) (holding that a\n\nconstitutional right is clearly established if \"a consensus of\n\npersuasive authority\" exists \"such that a reasonable officer could\n\nnot have believed that his actions were lawful\"); Bergeron, 560\n\nF.3d at 11-12.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\f             The    Mayor's     underlying    argument     as   to    the    Fourth\n\nAmendment qualified immunity issue is that, as a matter of law, a\n\ncourt should now hold that a reasonable official in the Mayor's\n\nposition would not have thought he was violating the plaintiffs'\n\nFourth Amendment rights, under the second aspect of the \"clearly\n\nestablished\" second prong.          He reasons that there is a diminished\n\nexpectation of privacy in pet ownership, and that diminished\n\ninterest routinely must give way to public safety and health\n\nconcerns.     The Mayor argues that the plaintiffs' privacy interest\n\nin   their   pets    was   particularly       diminished    here     because    the\n\nresidents had \"voluntarily subscribed\" to the pet policy through\n\ntheir lease agreements.          Given the state's interest in collecting\n\nstray animals, the plaintiffs' \"voluntary\" subscription to the pet\n\npolicy, and the Municipality's decision to collect strays and\n\naccept non-conforming pets only with advance notice, the Mayor\n\nargues that he could reasonably believe that his actions did not\n\nviolate the Fourth Amendment.\n\n             The    Mayor's    version   of    what   happened       is,   however,\n\ninconsistent with the factual allegations of the complaint, which\n\nwe must take as true.         Starting with the pet policy, the inferences\n\nfrom the complaint are that the terms of the pet policy were not\n\npart of plaintiffs' leases, and were imposed after the fact and\n\nwithout the residents' consent.          A reasonable inference from the\n\ncomplaint is that the pet policy was new to the residents of these\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\fthree public housing complexes and was unilaterally imposed by the\n\nMayor on October 1.    These are material disputes of fact as to when\n\nthe   pet    policy   was   first   applied   to   plaintiffs   and   the\n\ncircumstances under which it was applied.          The Mayor says these\n\ndisputes are immaterial by pointing to 42 U.S.C. § 1437z-3, a\n\npublic health and welfare law covering pet ownership in public\n\nhousing complexes. But that statute works against the Mayor for it\n\nauthorizes public housing residents to own common household pets\n\n\"subject to the reasonable requirements of the public housing\n\nagency.\"    Id. § 1437z-3(a).3\n\n            The residents also complain about the manner in which\n\nthey were notified of the policy, and their lack of an opportunity\n\nto object.    The residents are predominantly Spanish speaking; yet\n\nthe Municipality provided the pet policy to them only in English.\n\nThe notice on its face did not provide any opportunity to object to\n\nthe policy.     Nor did the notice say when the policy would be\n\nenforced.     And the short length of time between the residents'\n\nreceipt of the notice and the policy's enforcement, the plaintiffs\n\nallege, provided them with insufficient opportunity to find humane\n\nsolutions for any pets which they had to relinquish.\n\n\n\n\n      3\n          It is unclear whether the residents also deny that the\npet policy is a reasonable requirement or that there have been\nproblems such as to justify the regulations. If so, this presents\nmaterial issues of disputed fact.\n\n                                    -16-\n\f          We cannot say on the basis of the pleadings alone that an\n\nobjective official in the Mayor's position, as a matter of law,\n\nwould have reasonably concluded his actions in implementing and\n\nexecuting the pet policy were not a violation of the Fourth\n\nAmendment.   The district court was correct to deny the Mayor\n\nqualified immunity on the Fourth Amendment claims based on the\n\npleadings.\n\nB.        Application of Qualified Immunity Analysis       to   the\n          Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Claims\n\n          The Mayor has waived any appeal from the denial of\n\nqualified immunity as to the Fourteenth Amendment procedural due\n\nprocess claims by failing to brief it.4\n\n          The plaintiffs have also alleged Fourteenth Amendment\n\nsubstantive due process violations, and the Mayor does appeal from\n\nthe denial of qualified immunity as to those claims.    Fourteenth\n\nAmendment substantive due process claims often turn on whether the\n\nalleged misconduct \"shocks the conscience.\" See Espinoza v. Sabol,\n\n558 F.3d 83, 87 (1st Cir. 2009) (\"The substantive component of the\n\nDue Process Clause is violated by executive action 'when it can\n\nproperly be characterized as arbitrary, or conscience shocking, in\n\na constitutional sense.'\"   (quoting County of Sacramento v. Lewis,\n\n523 U.S. 833, 847 (1998))).\n\n\n\n     4\n          This does not mean he is barred from raising qualified\nimmunity as to the procedural due process claims again on a more\ndeveloped record before or at trial.\n\n                                -17-\n\f           The Mayor's primary argument that he is entitled to\n\nimmunity is that a \"shock the conscience\" violation against him or\n\nother   municipal   officials    is    not   stated   on   the   face   of    the\n\ncomplaint because such a claim cannot arise as to the treatment of\n\nanimals.    He makes a cursory argument that such a claim may be\n\nstated only as to the treatment of people and that the treatment of\n\nanimals must be left to state law.              But the language of the\n\nFourteenth Amendment is that a state shall not \"deprive any person\n\nof life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\"                  U.S.\n\nConst. amend. XIV, § 1.     The Fourteenth Amendment protects against\n\ncertain    deprivations     of   people's     property,     and    \"property\"\n\nencompasses people's pet cats and dogs.\n\n           The Mayor's argument continues that the substantive due\n\nprocess \"shock the conscience\" caselaw does not apply in situations\n\nof deprivation of property, but only to deprivations of the life\n\nand/or liberty of a person.       This argument, we think, ignores the\n\nlanguage of the Amendment.       It is the effect on the person from the\n\ndeprivation of the interest in life, liberty, or property which may\n\nbe   \"shocking   to   the    conscience,\"      and    perhaps     beyond      the\n\nconstitutional pale.      We see no reason to read the word \"property\"\n\nout of the Amendment; we would be reluctant to conclude that\n\ndeprivations of property cannot ever be so shocking in their effect\n\non the person as to lead to a Fourteenth Amendment substantive due\n\nprocess violation. Cf. Clark v. Boscher, 514 F.3d 107, 112-13 (1st\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\fCir.   2008)   (considering     an    alleged    substantive    due   process\n\nviolation involving the deprivation of property but recognizing\n\nthat \"the substantive due process doctrine may not, in the ordinary\n\ncourse, be invoked to challenge\" the type of misconduct alleged\n\n(quoting Mongeau v. City of Marlborough, 492 F.3d 14, 17 (1st Cir.\n\n2007))).\n\n            Yet it is also true that the Supreme Court has been firm\n\nin   its   reluctance   to   expand   the    doctrine   of   substantive   due\n\nprocess.    See Chavez, 538 U.S. at 775.         Indeed, it is because of\n\nthis resistance toward expanding the reach of substantive due\n\nprocess that the official conduct \"most likely to rise to the\n\nconscience-shocking level\" is \"conduct intended to injure in some\n\nway unjustifiable by any government interest.\" Id. (quoting Lewis,\n\n523 U.S. at 849) (internal quotation marks omitted).             While there\n\nis reason for skepticism about the plaintiffs' theory, we are\n\nreluctant to resolve at this point the question of whether the\n\ngovernment had an interest sufficient to justify the cruel killing\n\nof household pets arbitrarily seized from their owners, even if the\n\ngovernment ultimately had a legitimate interest in restricting\n\nownership of pet cats and dogs in public housing.             We do not need\n\nto render what would essentially be an advisory opinion on these\n\nprecise arguments by the Mayor that a substantive due process claim\n\nmay never be stated as to the arbitrary and cruel seizure and\n\nkilling of pets.    See Pearson, 129 S. Ct. at 818.\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\f          Instead, we resolve the qualified immunity issue in the\n\nMayor's favor under Pearson's first prong for different reasons.\n\nThat is, analyzing the pleadings under Iqbal, we hold that the\n\nallegations of the complaint do not allege a sufficient connection\n\nbetween the Mayor and the alleged conscience-shocking behavior --\n\nthe killing of the seized pets -- to state the elements of a\n\nsubstantive due process violation.5\n\n          The purported liability of the Mayor for damages for\n\nsubstantive due process violations does not involve a policy of the\n\nMunicipality for which he is responsible, nor does it rest on his\n\npersonal conduct.   Instead, the allegations against the Mayor are\n\nthat he promulgated a pet policy for the public housing complexes\n\nand was present at and participated in one of the raids.      This\n\nlevel of involvement is insufficient to support a finding of\n\nliability.\n\n          First, there is nothing conscience-shocking about the pet\n\npolicy itself.      The terms of the pet policy, for which the\n\ncomplaint holds the Mayor responsible, say nothing about how\n\n\"Prohibited Pets,\" which include cats and dogs, are to be removed\n\n\n\n     5\n          The district court, in denying qualified immunity on the\nsubstantive due process claim, did not analyze the specific facts\nalleged against the Mayor, but incorrectly focused instead on the\nacts of the \"government officials.\" We also note that the district\ncourt opinion uses language which could be misread to conclude that\nthe court found the defendants had in fact violated constitutional\nrights. That issue was not before the court, and it could make no\nsuch findings at this stage in the litigation.\n\n                               -20-\n\ffrom       their   owners      or    what   happens      thereafter    to    the    pets.\n\nPlaintiffs complaint identifies no policy which authorized the\n\nkilling of the pets, much less one which the Mayor authorized.6\n\n               Second, the complaint does not allege that the Mayor was\n\npersonally involved in any conscience-shocking conduct during the\n\nraids. The complaint does allege that the Mayor was present during\n\nthe first raid on October 8, 2007 and that he observed it.                         But he\n\nis not named as the individual who directly planned, supervised,\n\nand executed the raids of their aftermath; the complaint merely\n\nalleges that he supervised, directly or indirectly, the agencies\n\ninvolved. And there is no allegation the Mayor participated in the\n\nkilling      of    any   pet    or   directed      the   services     of    the   private\n\ncontractor.\n\n               There is a generalized allegation that the Mayor planned,\n\npersonally participated in, and executed the raids in concert with\n\nothers, but the others are named as the persons with specific\n\nadministrative responsibilities as to the public housing complexes.\n\n\n\n       6\n          The complaint alleges that an informal policy emerged\nfrom the repeating of the raids. But a single repetition of the\nraids alone is insufficient to establish endorsement of an informal\npolicy by the Mayor.     See Estate of Bennett, 548 F.3d at 177\n(recognizing that to impose liability on the policymaking official\nunder § 1983, a policy \"must be so well settled and widespread that\nthe policymaking officials of the municipality can be said to have\neither actual or constructive knowledge of it yet did nothing to\nend the practice\" (quoting Bordanaro v. McLeod, 871 F.2d 1151, 1156\n(1st Cir. 1989))). We reject such \"'naked assertion[s]' devoid of\n'further factual enhancement.'\" Iqbal, 2009 WL 1361536, at *12\n(alteration in original) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557).\n\n                                            -21-\n\f\"These bare assertions, much like the pleading of conspiracy in\n\nTwombly, amount to nothing more than a 'formulaic recitation of the\n\nelements' of a constitutional [tort],\" Iqbal, 2009 WL 1361536, at\n\n*14 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555), and are insufficient to\n\npush the plaintiffs' claim beyond the pleadings stage.                Moreover,\n\nthe complaint alleges, without any more details, that the Mayor was\n\namong all the other public and private employees \"snatching pets\n\nfrom owners.\"     Although these bare allegations may be \"consistent\n\nwith\" a finding of liability against the Mayor for seizure of the\n\nsame pets, such allegations \"stop[] short of the line between\n\npossibility and plausibility of 'entitlement to relief'\" on the\n\nlarger substantive due process claim.             Iqbal, 2009 WL 1361536, at\n\n*12 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n            A   government    official      who    himself    inflicts     truly\n\noutrageous, uncivilized, and intolerable harm on a person or his\n\nproperty may be liable; but there is no claim in this complaint the\n\nMayor   himself   inflicted   such    harm.        Cf.   Vélez-Díaz   v.   Vega-\n\nIrizarry, 421 F.3d 71, 79 (1st Cir. 2005) (granting qualified\n\nimmunity where there was no allegation that the government actors\n\nwere directly involved in the offensive conduct).             The allegations\n\nagainst the Mayor thus do not establish that his involvement was\n\nsufficiently direct to hold him liable for violations of the\n\nplaintiffs' substantive due process rights.\n\n\n                                     -22-\n\f          Nor    do   the    allegations     make    out    a   viable        case   for\n\nsupervisory    liability,      such   that    the    Mayor      could,       on   these\n\npleadings, be held responsible for violations of the plaintiffs'\n\nsubstantive due process rights committed by subordinate municipal\n\nemployees or workers from ACS.7           See Estate of Bennett, 548 F.3d at\n\n176-77   (explaining        that    supervisory      liability         for     alleged\n\nsubstantive     due   process       violations      requires       a       showing    of\n\n\"supervisory encouragement, condonation or acquiescence or gross\n\nnegligence amounting to deliberate indifference\" (quoting Pineda v.\n\nToomey, 533 F.3d 50, 54 (1st Cir. 2008))).                  Indeed, supervisory\n\nliability lies only where an \"'affirmative link' between the\n\nbehavior of a subordinate and the action or inaction of his\n\nsupervisor\"    exists   such       that   \"'the   supervisor's             conduct   led\n\ninexorably to the constitutional violation.'\"                Pineda, 533 F.3d at\n\n54 (quoting Hegarty v. Somerset County, 53 F.3d 1367, 1380 (1st\n\nCir. 1995)).\n\n          Further,      supervisory        liability       under       a    theory    of\n\ndeliberate indifference \"will be found only if it would be manifest\n\n\n     7\n           Some recent language from the Supreme Court may call into\nquestion our prior circuit law on the standard for holding a public\nofficial liable for damages under § 1983 on a theory of supervisory\nliability. See Iqbal, 2009 WL 1361536, at *11 (\"Because vicarious\nliability is inapplicable to Bivens and § 1983 suits, a plaintiff\nmust plead that each Government-official defendant, through the\nofficial's    own    individual    actions,   has    violated    the\nConstitution.\"). We need not resolve this issue, however, because\nwe find that the plaintiffs have not pled facts sufficient to make\nout a plausible entitlement to relief under our previous\nformulation of the standards for supervisory liability.\n\n                                      -23-\n\fto any reasonable official that his conduct was very likely to\n\nviolate an individual's constitutional rights.\"               Id. (quoting\n\nHegarty, 53 F.3d at 1380) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nHere, the Mayor's promulgation of a pet policy that was silent as\n\nto the manner in which the pets were to be collected and disposed\n\nof, coupled with his mere presence at one of the raids, is\n\ninsufficient to create the affirmative link necessary for a finding\n\nof   supervisory    liability,   even   under   a   theory   of   deliberate\n\nindifference.      The Mayor is entitled to qualified immunity on the\n\npleadings on the Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process\n\nclaims.\n\n           We note that the Mayor has denied many of the factual\n\nallegations asserted in the complaint.          Nothing in this opinion\n\nprecludes the Mayor from seeking qualified immunity on a further\n\ndeveloped record at a later stage.\n\n                                   IV.\n\n           The district court's order denying the Mayor qualified\n\nimmunity as to the plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment and Fourteenth\n\nAmendment procedural due process claims is affirmed.          The district\n\ncourt's order denying the Mayor qualified immunity as to the\n\nplaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process claims is\n\nreversed, and the plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment substantive due\n\nprocess claims are dismissed. Each party shall bear its own costs.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -24-\n\f",

Yet we need not accept as true legal conclusions from the complaint or \"`naked assertion[s]' devoid of `further factual enhancement.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 1960 (alteration in original) (quoting <i>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly,</i> 550 U.S. 544, 557, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)).</p>\n<p>The Municipality assumed operational control over three public housing complexes in Barceloneta from the PRPHA on October 1, 2007. Between October 3 and 7, 2007, the Municipality delivered notices to residents of those complexes that it would be enforcing a pet policy, which prohibited the residents from having cats or dogs. The notices threatened eviction for those who did not surrender their pets and included an English-language copy of the pet policy, but not a Spanish-language version. The residents of those complexes are predominantly Spanish speakers. Plaintiffs allege that few speak, read, or write English. Before the Municipality took control of the housing complexes, residents had kept pets with the knowledge and consent of the housing complexes' administrators, and there was no enforced prohibition on the ownership of a cat or dog.</p>\n<p>On October 8, 2007, without any further notice to the residents, uniformed municipal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*267</span> employees and workers from Animal Control Solutions, Inc. (\"ACS\"), a private contractor hired by the Municipality, arrived at the three public housing complexes and violently captured numerous pet cats and dogs. They went door-to-door and demanded that the residents give up their pets or face eviction. Many people complied. Some residents who were not home at the time had their pets taken from inside their enclosed patios and laundry areas. Municipal employees and ACS workers also captured several pets that were in the common areas of the housing project, even taking pets away from children. The Mayor and other high ranking municipal officials were present that day at least at one of the housing complexes while the animals were seized.</p>\n<p>Once the pets were captured, municipal employees and ACS workers injected some of the animals with an unknown substance. They also slammed the animals against the side of a van, causing some witnesses to believe that their pets had been killed in their presence. Those animals surviving the initial trauma were then thrown to their deaths off a 50-foot-high bridge, known as El Paseo de Indio (\"The Indian Walk\"). Some residents eventually found their pets dead underneath the bridge.</p>\n<p>Similar raids occurred two days later at each of the three housing complexes, also resulting in the cruel killings of the residents' animals. There is no claim that the defendant Mayor was present at these raids. The residents protested. On October 17, 2007, the Municipality resigned its position as the administrator of the public housing complexes in Barceloneta.</p>\n<p>On October 19, 2007, the residents sued the Mayor and other municipal officials under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, claiming violations of their rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, as well as under other federal and state laws that are not involved in this appeal. The complaint sought, inter alia, punitive damages and compensatory damages of at least $1500 for the value of each pet and $500,000 for the harm inflicted on each plaintiff, as well as injunctive and declaratory relief.</p>\n<p>On April 29, 2008, the Mayor moved to dismiss all the damage claims against him, asserting qualified immunity. On July 29, 2008, the district court issued an opinion and order denying the Mayor qualified immunity on the plaintiffs' Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment claims.<sup>[1]</sup> This interlocutory appeal from the district court's denial of qualified immunity followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Appellate Jurisdiction over Denials of Qualified Immunity</i>\n</h2>\n<p>An order rejecting a public official's qualified immunity defense is immediately appealable as a \"final\" judgment within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 1291 to the extent that it turns on an issue of law. <i>Iqbal,</i> 129 S.Ct. at 1947 (\"[T]his court has been careful to say that a district court's order rejecting qualified immunity at the motion-to-dismiss stage of a proceeding is a `final decision' within the meaning of § 1291.\"); <i>Behrens v. Pelletier,</i> 516 U.S. 299, 306-07, 116 S.Ct. 834, 133 L.Ed.2d 773 (1996); <i>Bergeron v. Cabral,</i> 560 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2009). That is, \"when the district court assumes a set of facts favorable to the plaintiff and decides as a matter of law that those facts do not form a satisfactory basis for a finding of qualified immunity, an interlocutory appeal is available under <span class=\"star-pagination\">*268</span> the collateral order doctrine.\" <i>Bergeron,</i> 560 F.3d at 6.</p>\n<p>Here, we have jurisdiction to consider the Mayor's legal argument that the plaintiffs have not stated cognizable constitutional violations, accepting the facts alleged in the complaint as true. We also have jurisdiction to decide whether the constitutional rights that the Mayor allegedly violated were clearly established at the time. But we do not at this stage in the litigation have jurisdiction to decide whether any constitutional violations actually occurred or to resolve any factual disputes necessary to make that determination.</p>\n<p>Assessing qualified immunity at the motion to dismiss stage requires that we evaluate the sufficiency of the plaintiffs' pleadings. Indeed, because \"whether a particular complaint sufficiently alleges a clearly established violation of law cannot be decided in isolation from the facts pleaded,\" <i>Iqbal,</i> at 1946, we must scrutinize the plaintiffs' complaint to determine whether it states a plausible entitlement to relief.</p>\n<p>Two underlying principles guide our assessment of the adequacy of the plaintiffs' pleadings. \"First, the tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions. Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1949 (citing <i>Twombly,</i> 550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955). Such conclusory statements are \"not entitled to the assumption of truth.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>\"Second, only a complaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Twombly,</i> 550 U.S. at 556, 127 S.Ct. 1955). This second principle recognizes that the court's assessment of the pleadings is \"context-specific,\" requiring \"the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\" <i>Id.</i> \"[W]here the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has allegedbut it has not `show[n]'`that the pleader is entitled to relief.'\" <i>Id.</i> (second alteration in original) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>The Qualified Immunity Doctrine</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The qualified immunity doctrine provides defendant public officials an immunity from suit and not a mere defense to liability. <i>Mitchell v. Forsyth,</i> 472 U.S. 511, 526, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985). For this reason, immunity is to be resolved at the earliest possible stage in litigation. <i>Hunter v. Bryant,</i> 502 U.S. 224, 227, 112 S.Ct. 534, 116 L.Ed.2d 589 (1991). In some cases, the doctrine ensures that insubstantial claims against government officials will be resolved before discovery. <i>Anderson v. Creighton,</i> 483 U.S. 635, 640, n. 2, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987). Indeed, \"[t]he basic thrust of the qualified immunity doctrine is to free officials from the concerns of litigation, including `avoidance of disruptive discovery.'\" <i>Iqbal,</i> at 1953 (quoting <i>Siegert v. Gilley,</i> 500 U.S. 226, 236, 111 S.Ct. 1789, 114 L.Ed.2d 277 (1991) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Qualified Immunity: A Two-Step Analysis</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The Supreme Court's most recent rulings on qualified immunity provide clarification on several points and require some revision of the nomenclature and steps this circuit has previously used.</p>\n<p>In <i>Pearson v. Callahan,</i> ___ U.S. ____, 129 S.Ct. 808, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009), the Court reiterated that the qualified <span class=\"star-pagination\">*269</span> immunity inquiry is a two-part test. A court must decide: (1) whether the facts alleged or shown by the plaintiff make out a violation of a constitutional right; and (2) if so, whether the right was \"clearly established\" at the time of the defendant's alleged violation. <i>Id.</i> at 815-16. The Supreme Court has often described the analysis as a two-step test. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> at 815; <i>Scott v. Harris,</i> 550 U.S. 372, 377, 127 S.Ct. 1769, 167 L.Ed.2d 686 (2007); <i>Brosseau v. Haugen,</i> 543 U.S. 194, 195, 125 S.Ct. 596, 160 L.Ed.2d 583 (2004) (per curiam); <i>Chavez v. Martinez,</i> 538 U.S. 760, 766, 123 S.Ct. 1994, 155 L.Ed.2d 984 (2003); <i>Saucier v. Katz,</i> 533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001), <i>overruled in part by </i><i>Pearson,</i> ___ U.S. ____, 129 S.Ct. 808, 172 L.Ed.2d 565.</p>\n<p>It is clear from the Supreme Court's description of the second, \"clearly established\" step of the qualified immunity analysis that the second step, in turn, has two aspects. One aspect of the analysis focuses on the clarity of the law at the time of the alleged civil rights violation. To overcome qualified immunity, \"[t]he contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.\" <i>Anderson,</i> 483 U.S. at 640, 107 S.Ct. 3034. The other aspect focuses more concretely on the facts of the particular case and whether a reasonable defendant would have understood that his conduct violated the plaintiffs' constitutional rights. Indeed, \"[i]t is important to emphasize that this inquiry `must be undertaken in light of the specific context of the case, not as a broad general proposition.'\" <i>Brosseau,</i> 543 U.S. at 198, 125 S.Ct. 596 (quoting <i>Saucier,</i> 533 U.S. at 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151). Cognizant of both the contours of the allegedly infringed right and the particular facts of the case, \"[t]he relevant, dispositive inquiry in determining whether a right is clearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.\" <i>Id.</i> at 199, 125 S.Ct. 596 (quoting <i>Saucier,</i> 533 U.S. at 202, 121 S.Ct. 2151) (internal quotation marks omitted). That is, the salient question is whether the state of the law at the time of the alleged violation gave the defendant fair warning that his particular conduct was unconstitutional. <i>See </i><i>Hope v. Pelzer,</i> 536 U.S. 730, 741, 122 S.Ct. 2508, 153 L.Ed.2d 666 (2002).</p>\n<p>In administering the Court's test, this circuit has tended to list separately the two sub-parts of the \"clearly established\" prong along with the first prong and, as a result, has articulated the qualified immunity test as a three-part test. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Bergeron,</i> 560 F.3d at 7 &amp; n. 2; <i>Estate of Bennett v. Wainwright,</i> 548 F.3d 155, 167 (1st Cir.2008); <i>Parker v. Gerrish,</i> 547 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir.2008); <i>Philip v. Cronin,</i> 537 F.3d 26, 34 (1st Cir.2008). While the substance of our three-part test has been faithful to the substance of the Court's two-part test, we owe fidelity to the Court's articulation of the test as well. And so we now adopt the Court's two-part test and abandon our previous usage of a three-step analysis.</p>\n<p>This we can do without invoking an en banc court given the intervention of the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Pearson. See </i><i>Wallace v. Reno,</i> 194 F.3d 279, 283 (1st Cir.1999) (\"When a panel of this circuit has decided an issue, another panel will ordinarily not revisit that issue; but, of course, this limitation does not apply where an intervening decision of the Supreme Court overturns or undermines our earlier decision.\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>It is Permissible to Avoid the First Step of the Qualified Immunity Analysis</i>\n</h2>\n<p><i>Pearson</i> also held that while it is frequently appropriate for courts to answer <span class=\"star-pagination\">*270</span> each step in turn, it is not mandatory that courts follow the two-step analysis sequentially. Courts have discretion to decide whether, on the facts of a particular case, it is worthwhile to address first whether the facts alleged make out a violation of a constitutional right.</p>\n<p>As <i>Pearson</i> explained, the primary motivation behind <i>Saucier</i>'s sequential two-step rule was to promote the development of constitutional precedent. 129 S.Ct. at 816. Of course, there may be instances where \"a discussion of why the relevant facts do not violate clearly established law... make[s] it apparent that in fact the relevant facts do not make out a constitutional violation at all,\" <i>id.</i> at 818, making it worthwhile to address the first prong of the qualified immunity analysis.</p>\n<p>But in some cases, discussion of the first prong of the qualified immunity analysis will result \"in a substantial expenditure of scarce judicial resources on difficult questions that have no effect on the outcome of the case.\" <i>Id.</i> This expenditure of resources by the courts and the parties is difficult to justify in cases where the constitutional questions presented are heavily fact-bound, minimizing their precedential value. <i>Id.</i> at 819.</p>\n<p>Further, the utility of bypassing the first prong is particularly apparent \"[w]hen qualified immunity is asserted at the pleading stage [because] the precise factual basis for the plaintiff's claim or claims may be hard to identify.\" <i>Id.</i> Indeed, as this circuit has held, and <i>Pearson</i> recognized, where the answer to the first prong of the immunity question may depend on the further development of the facts, it may be wise to avoid the first step. <i>See id.</i> (citing <i>Buchanan v. Maine,</i> 469 F.3d 158, 168 (1st Cir.2006)). The Mayor here has chosen not to wait, but to press the Fourth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment issues at the pleadings stage, and then to appeal, in part, the denial of qualified immunity on the pleadings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Application of Qualified Immunity Analysis to the Fourth Amendment Claim</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The Mayor argues that the complaint fails to state a cognizable constitutional claim under the Fourth Amendment because that Amendment does not provide protection to individuals in their ownership of household pets under these circumstances. The first part of the Mayor's argument is essentially that taking plaintiffs' assertions in the complaint as true, the complaint still fails to state a Fourth Amendment claim.</p>\n<p>An individual's interest in his pet cat or dog does fall within the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of unreasonable seizures, though we have not addressed the question before. As the Fourth Circuit's decision in <i>Altman v. City of High Point,</i> 330 F.3d 194 (4th Cir.2003), establishes, privately owned pet dogs do qualify as property, such that pets are \"effects\" under the seizure clause of the Fourth Amendment.<sup>[2]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 202-04. We rely on and do not repeat Judge Luttig's scholarly analysis that dogs are \"effects\" for purposes <span class=\"star-pagination\">*271</span> of being secure from unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p>The killing of a person's pet dog or cat by the government without the person's consent is also a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. Three other circuits had announced this conclusion well before the violations alleged here. <i>See </i><i>Brown v. Muhlenberg Twp.,</i> 269 F.3d 205, 210 (3d Cir.2001); <i>Fuller v. Vines,</i> 36 F.3d 65, 68 (9th Cir. 1994), <i>overruled on other grounds by </i><i>Robinson v. Solano County,</i> 278 F.3d 1007 (9th Cir.2002); <i>Lesher v. Reed,</i> 12 F.3d 148, 150-51 (8th Cir.1994). Since then, the Seventh Circuit has also held that the killing of a companion dog is a Fourth Amendment seizure. <i>See </i><i>Viilo v. Eyre,</i> 547 F.3d 707, 710 (7th Cir.2008). No circuit court has held otherwise.</p>\n<p>We reject the Mayor's argument that this law was not clearly established because <i>this</i> court had not earlier addressed the questions of effects and seizure. Against the widespread acceptance of these points in the federal circuit courts, the Mayor's argument fails. These are principles of law, and the law was sufficiently recognized by courts to be clearly established. <i>See </i><i>Wilson v. Layne,</i> 526 U.S. 603, 617, 119 S.Ct. 1692, 143 L.Ed.2d 818 (1999) (holding that a constitutional right is clearly established if \"a consensus of persuasive authority\" exists \"such that a reasonable officer could not have believed that his actions were lawful\"); <i>Bergeron,</i> 560 F.3d at 11-12.</p>\n<p>The Mayor's underlying argument as to the Fourth Amendment qualified immunity issue is that, as a matter of law, a court should now hold that a reasonable official in the Mayor's position would not have thought he was violating the plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment rights, under the second aspect of the \"clearly established\" second prong. He reasons that there is a diminished expectation of privacy in pet ownership, and that diminished interest routinely must give way to public safety and health concerns. The Mayor argues that the plaintiffs' privacy interest in their pets was particularly diminished here because the residents had \"voluntarily subscribed\" to the pet policy through their lease agreements. Given the state's interest in collecting stray animals, the plaintiffs' \"voluntary\" subscription to the pet policy, and the Municipality's decision to collect strays and accept non-conforming pets only with advance notice, the Mayor argues that he could reasonably believe that his actions did not violate the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p>The Mayor's version of what happened is, however, inconsistent with the factual allegations of the complaint, which we must take as true. Starting with the pet policy, the inferences from the complaint are that the terms of the pet policy were not part of plaintiffs' leases, and were imposed after the fact and without the residents' consent. A reasonable inference from the complaint is that the pet policy was new to the residents of these three public housing complexes and was unilaterally imposed by the Mayor on October 1. These are material disputes of fact as to when the pet policy was first applied to plaintiffs and the circumstances under which it was applied. The Mayor says these disputes are immaterial by pointing to 42 U.S.C. § 1437z-3, a public health and welfare law covering pet ownership in public housing complexes. But that statute works against the Mayor for it authorizes public housing residents to own common household pets \"subject to the reasonable requirements of the public housing agency.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*272</span> <i>Id.</i> § 1437z-3(a).<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>The residents also complain about the manner in which they were notified of the policy, and their lack of an opportunity to object. The residents are predominantly Spanish speaking; yet the Municipality provided the pet policy to them only in English. The notice on its face did not provide any opportunity to object to the policy. Nor did the notice say when the policy would be enforced. And the short length of time between the residents' receipt of the notice and the policy's enforcement, the plaintiffs allege, provided them with insufficient opportunity to find humane solutions for any pets which they had to relinquish.</p>\n<p>We cannot say on the basis of the pleadings alone that an objective official in the Mayor's position, as a matter of law, would have reasonably concluded his actions in implementing and executing the pet policy were not a violation of the Fourth Amendment. The district court was correct to deny the Mayor qualified immunity on the Fourth Amendment claims based on the pleadings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Application of Qualified Immunity Analysis to the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Claims</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The Mayor has waived any appeal from the denial of qualified immunity as to the Fourteenth Amendment <i>procedural</i> due process claims by failing to brief it.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>The plaintiffs have also alleged Fourteenth Amendment <i>substantive</i> due process violations, and the Mayor does appeal from the denial of qualified immunity as to those claims. Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process claims often turn on whether the alleged misconduct \"shocks the conscience.\" <i>See </i><i>Espinoza v. Sabol,</i> 558 F.3d 83, 87 (1st Cir.2009) (\"The substantive component of the Due Process Clause is violated by executive action `when it can properly be characterized as arbitrary, or conscience shocking, in a constitutional sense.'\" (quoting <i>County of Sacramento v. Lewis,</i> 523 U.S. 833, 847, 118 S.Ct. 1708, 140 L.Ed.2d 1043 (1998))).</p>\n<p>The Mayor's primary argument that he is entitled to immunity is that a \"shock the conscience\" violation against him or other municipal officials is not stated on the face of the complaint because such a claim cannot arise as to the treatment of animals. He makes a cursory argument that such a claim may be stated only as to the treatment of people and that the treatment of animals must be left to state law. But the language of the Fourteenth Amendment is that a state shall not \"deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1. The Fourteenth Amendment protects against certain deprivations of people's property, and \"property\" encompasses people's pet cats and dogs.</p>\n<p>The Mayor's argument continues that the substantive due process \"shock the conscience\" caselaw does not apply in situations of deprivation of property, but only to deprivations of the life and/or liberty of a person. This argument, we think, ignores the language of the Amendment. It is the <i>effect</i> on the person from the deprivation of the interest in life, liberty, or property which may be \"shocking to the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*273</span> conscience,\" and perhaps beyond the constitutional pale. We see no reason to read the word \"property\" out of the Amendment; we would be reluctant to conclude that deprivations of property cannot ever be so shocking in their effect on the person as to lead to a Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process violation. <i>Cf. </i><i>Clark v. Boscher,</i> 514 F.3d 107, 112-13 (1st Cir.2008) (considering an alleged substantive due process violation involving the deprivation of property but recognizing that \"the substantive due process doctrine may not, in the ordinary course, be invoked to challenge\" the type of misconduct alleged (quoting <i>Mongeau v. City of Marlborough,</i> 492 F.3d 14, 17 (1st Cir.2007))).</p>\n<p>Yet it is also true that the Supreme Court has been firm in its reluctance to expand the doctrine of substantive due process. <i>See </i><i>Chavez,</i> 538 U.S. at 775, 123 S.Ct. 1994. Indeed, it is because of this resistance toward expanding the reach of substantive due process that the official conduct \"most likely to rise to the conscience-shocking level\" is \"conduct intended to injure in some way unjustifiable by any government interest.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Lewis,</i> 523 U.S. at 849, 118 S.Ct. 1708) (internal quotation marks omitted). While there is reason for skepticism about the plaintiffs' theory, we are reluctant to resolve at this point the question of whether the government had an interest sufficient to justify the cruel killing of household pets arbitrarily seized from their owners, even if the government ultimately had a legitimate interest in restricting ownership of pet cats and dogs in public housing. We do not need to render what would essentially be an advisory opinion on these precise arguments by the Mayor that a substantive due process claim may never be stated as to the arbitrary and cruel seizure and killing of pets. <i>See </i><i>Pearson,</i> 129 S.Ct. at 818.</p>\n<p>Instead, we resolve the qualified immunity issue in the Mayor's favor under <i>Pearson</i>'s first prong for different reasons. That is, analyzing the pleadings under <i>Iqbal,</i> we hold that the allegations of the complaint do not allege a sufficient connection between the Mayor and the alleged conscience-shocking behaviorthe killing of the seized petsto state the elements of a substantive due process violation.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>The purported liability of the Mayor for damages for substantive due process violations does not involve a policy of the Municipality for which he is responsible, nor does it rest on his personal conduct. Instead, the allegations against the Mayor are that he promulgated a pet policy for the public housing complexes and was present at and participated in one of the raids. This level of involvement is insufficient to support a finding of liability.</p>\n<p>First, there is nothing conscience-shocking about the pet policy itself. The terms of the pet policy, for which the complaint holds the Mayor responsible, say nothing about how \"Prohibited Pets,\" which include cats and dogs, are to be removed from their owners or what happens thereafter to the pets. Plaintiffs complaint identifies no policy which authorized the killing of the pets, much less one which the Mayor authorized.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*274</span> Second, the complaint does not allege that the Mayor was personally involved in any conscience-shocking conduct during the raids. The complaint does allege that the Mayor was present during the first raid on October 8, 2007 and that he observed it. But he is not named as the individual who directly planned, supervised, and executed the raids of their aftermath; the complaint merely alleges that he supervised, directly or indirectly, the agencies involved. And there is no allegation the Mayor participated in the killing of any pet or directed the services of the private contractor.</p>\n<p>There is a generalized allegation that the Mayor planned, personally participated in, and executed the raids in concert with others, but the others are named as the persons with specific administrative responsibilities as to the public housing complexes. \"These bare assertions, much like the pleading of conspiracy in <i>Twombly,</i> amount to nothing more than a `formulaic recitation of the elements' of a constitutional [tort],\" <i>Iqbal,</i> at 1951 (quoting <i>Twombly,</i> 550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955), and are insufficient to push the plaintiffs' claim beyond the pleadings stage. Moreover, the complaint alleges, without any more details, that the Mayor was among all the other public and private employees \"snatching pets from owners.\" Although these bare allegations may be \"consistent with\" a finding of liability against the Mayor for seizure of the same pets, such allegations \"stop[] short of the line between possibility and plausibility of `entitlement to relief'\" on the larger substantive due process claim. <i>Iqbal,</i> at 1960 (quoting <i>Twombly,</i> 550 U.S. at 557, 127 S.Ct. 1955) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>A government official who himself inflicts truly outrageous, uncivilized, and intolerable harm on a person or his property may be liable; but there is no claim in this complaint the Mayor himself inflicted such harm. <i>Cf. </i><i>Velez-Diaz v. Vega-Irizarry,</i> 421 F.3d 71, 79 (1st Cir.2005) (granting qualified immunity where there was no allegation that the government actors were directly involved in the offensive conduct). The allegations against the Mayor thus do not establish that his involvement was sufficiently direct to hold him liable for violations of the plaintiffs' substantive due process rights.</p>\n<p>Nor do the allegations make out a viable case for supervisory liability, such that the Mayor could, on these pleadings, be held responsible for violations of the plaintiffs' substantive due process rights committed by subordinate municipal employees or workers from ACS.<sup>[7]</sup><i>See </i><i>Estate of Bennett,</i> 548 F.3d at 176-77 (explaining <span class=\"star-pagination\">*275</span> that supervisory liability for alleged substantive due process violations requires a showing of \"supervisory encouragement, condonation or acquiescence or gross negligence amounting to deliberate indifference\" (quoting <i>Pineda v. Toomey,</i> 533 F.3d 50, 54 (1st Cir.2008))). Indeed, supervisory liability lies only where an \"`affirmative link' between the behavior of a subordinate and the action or inaction of his supervisor\" exists such that \"`the supervisor's conduct led inexorably to the constitutional violation.'\" <i>Pineda,</i> 533 F.3d at 54 (quoting <i>Hegarty v. Somerset County,</i> 53 F.3d 1367, 1380 (1st Cir.1995)).</p>\n<p>Further, supervisory liability under a theory of deliberate indifference \"will be found only if it would be manifest to any reasonable official that his conduct was very likely to violate an individual's constitutional rights.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Hegarty,</i> 53 F.3d at 1380) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the Mayor's promulgation of a pet policy that was silent as to the manner in which the pets were to be collected and disposed of, coupled with his mere presence at one of the raids, is insufficient to create the affirmative link necessary for a finding of supervisory liability, even under a theory of deliberate indifference. The Mayor is entitled to qualified immunity on the pleadings on the Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process claims.</p>\n<p>We note that the Mayor has denied many of the factual allegations asserted in the complaint. Nothing in this opinion precludes the Mayor from seeking qualified immunity on a further developed record at a later stage.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>The district court's order denying the Mayor qualified immunity as to the plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment procedural due process claims is <i>affirmed.</i> The district court's order denying the Mayor qualified immunity as to the plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process claims is <i>reversed,</i> and the plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process claims are <i>dismissed.</i> Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The Mayor also moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim, which the district court granted as to a few claims, but denied as to the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment claims and pendent state law claims. That order was not appealable and is not before us.</p>\n<p>[2]  The Fourth Amendment provides, in relevant part: \"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.\" U.S. Const. amend. IV. The Fourth Amendment's prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures applies to Puerto Rico and to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. <i>See </i><i>Mapp v. Ohio,</i> 367 U.S. 643, 655, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961); <i>Martinez-Rivera v. Sánchez Ramos,</i> 498 F.3d 3, 7 n. 4 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>[3]  It is unclear whether the residents also deny that the pet policy is a reasonable requirement or that there have been problems such as to justify the regulations. If so, this presents material issues of disputed fact.</p>\n<p>[4]  This does not mean he is barred from raising qualified immunity as to the procedural due process claims again on a more developed record before or at trial.</p>\n<p>[5]  The district court, in denying qualified immunity on the substantive due process claim, did not analyze the specific facts alleged against the Mayor, but incorrectly focused instead on the acts of the \"government officials.\" We also note that the district court opinion uses language which could be misread to conclude that the court found the defendants had in fact violated constitutional rights. That issue was not before the court, and it could make no such findings at this stage in the litigation.</p>\n<p>[6]  The complaint alleges that an informal policy emerged from the repeating of the raids. But a single repetition of the raids alone is insufficient to establish endorsement of an informal policy by the Mayor. <i>See </i><i>Estate of Bennett,</i> 548 F.3d at 177 (recognizing that to impose liability on the policymaking official under § 1983, a policy \"must be so well settled and widespread that the policymaking officials of the municipality can be said to have either actual or constructive knowledge of it yet did nothing to end the practice\" (quoting <i>Bordanaro v. McLeod,</i> 871 F.2d 1151, 1156 (1st Cir.1989))). We reject such \"`naked assertion[s]' devoid of `further factual enhancement.'\" <i>Iqbal,</i> at 1950 (alteration in original) (quoting <i>Twombly,</i> 550 U.S. at 557, 127 S.Ct. 1955).</p>\n<p>[7]  Some recent language from the Supreme Court may call into question our prior circuit law on the standard for holding a public official liable for damages under § 1983 on a theory of supervisory liability. <i>See Iqbal,</i> at 1948 (\"Because vicarious liability is inapplicable to <i>Bivens</i> and § 1983 suits, a plaintiff must plead that each Government-official defendant, through the official's own individual actions, has violated the Constitution.\"). We need not resolve this issue, however, because we find that the plaintiffs have not pled facts sufficient to make out a plausible entitlement to relief under our previous formulation of the standards for supervisory liability.</p>\n\n</div>",

The twenty named plaintiff families assert violations of their Fourth Amendment rights to be free from unreasonable seizures of their \"effects\" and their Fourteenth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights.</p>\n<p>The pets were taken in two successive raids, within ten days of the Municipality of Barceloneta assuming control of the public housing complexes from the Puerto Rico Public Housing Administration (\"PRPHA\") on October 1, 2007. Plaintiffs allege that before that transfer, they had been permitted to have their pets. Only a few days before the raids, the residents were told to surrender their pets on pain of being evicted from their homes.

Between October 3 and 7, 2007, the Municipality delivered notices to residents of those complexes that it would be enforcing a pet policy, which prohibited the residents from having cats or dogs. The notices threatened eviction for those who did not surrender their pets and included an English-language copy of the pet policy, but not a Spanish-language version. The residents of those complexes are predominantly Spanish speakers. Plaintiffs allege that few speak, read, or write English. Before the Municipality took control of the housing complexes, residents had kept pets with the knowledge and consent of the housing complexes' administrators, and there was no enforced prohibition on the ownership of a cat or dog.</p>\n<p>On October 8, 2007, without any further notice to the residents, uniformed municipal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*267</span> employees and workers from Animal Control Solutions, Inc. (\"ACS\"), a private contractor hired by the Municipality, arrived at the three public housing complexes and violently captured numerous pet cats and dogs. They went door-to-door and demanded that the residents give up their pets or face eviction. Many people complied. Some residents who were not home at the time had their pets taken from inside their enclosed patios and laundry areas. Municipal employees and ACS workers also captured several pets that were in the common areas of the housing project, even taking pets away from children. The Mayor and other high ranking municipal officials were present that day at least at one of the housing complexes while the animals were seized.</p>\n<p>Once the pets were captured, municipal employees and ACS workers injected some of the animals with an unknown substance. They also slammed the animals against the side of a van, causing some witnesses to believe that their pets had been killed in their presence. Those animals surviving the initial trauma were then thrown to their deaths off a 50-foot-high bridge, known as El Paseo de Indio (\"The Indian Walk\"). Some residents eventually found their pets dead underneath the bridge.</p>\n<p>Similar raids occurred two days later at each of the three housing complexes, also resulting in the cruel killings of the residents' animals. There is no claim that the defendant Mayor was present at these raids. The residents protested. On October 17, 2007, the Municipality resigned its position as the administrator of the public housing complexes in Barceloneta.</p>\n<p>On October 19, 2007, the residents sued the Mayor and other municipal officials under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, claiming violations of their rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, as well as under other federal and state laws that are not involved in this appeal. The complaint sought, inter alia, punitive damages and compensatory damages of at least $1500 for the value of each pet and $500,000 for the harm inflicted on each plaintiff, as well as injunctive and declaratory relief.</p>\n<p>On April 29, 2008, the Mayor moved to dismiss all the damage claims against him, asserting qualified immunity. On July 29, 2008, the district court issued an opinion and order denying the Mayor qualified immunity on the plaintiffs' Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment claims.<sup>[1]</sup> This interlocutory appeal from the district court's denial of qualified immunity followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Appellate Jurisdiction over Denials of Qualified Immunity</i>\n</h2>\n<p>An order rejecting a public official's qualified immunity defense is immediately appealable as a \"final\" judgment within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 1291 to the extent that it turns on an issue of law. <i>Iqbal,</i> 129 S.Ct. at 1947 (\"[T]his court has been careful to say that a district court's order rejecting qualified immunity at the motion-to-dismiss stage of a proceeding is a `final decision' within the meaning of § 1291.\"); <i>Behrens v.

That is, \"when the district court assumes a set of facts favorable to the plaintiff and decides as a matter of law that those facts do not form a satisfactory basis for a finding of qualified immunity, an interlocutory appeal is available under <span class=\"star-pagination\">*268</span> the collateral order doctrine.\" <i>Bergeron,</i> 560 F.3d at 6.</p>\n<p>Here, we have jurisdiction to consider the Mayor's legal argument that the plaintiffs have not stated cognizable constitutional violations, accepting the facts alleged in the complaint as true. We also have jurisdiction to decide whether the constitutional rights that the Mayor allegedly violated were clearly established at the time. But we do not at this stage in the litigation have jurisdiction to decide whether any constitutional violations actually occurred or to resolve any factual disputes necessary to make that determination.</p>\n<p>Assessing qualified immunity at the motion to dismiss stage requires that we evaluate the sufficiency of the plaintiffs' pleadings. Indeed, because \"whether a particular complaint sufficiently alleges a clearly established violation of law cannot be decided in isolation from the facts pleaded,\" <i>Iqbal,</i> at 1946, we must scrutinize the plaintiffs' complaint to determine whether it states a plausible entitlement to relief.</p>\n<p>Two underlying principles guide our assessment of the adequacy of the plaintiffs' pleadings. \"First, the tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions. Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1949 (citing <i>Twombly,</i> 550 U.S. at 555, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145730\"><a href=\"/opinion/145730/bell-atlantic-corp-v-twombly/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

One aspect of the analysis focuses on the clarity of the law at the time of the alleged civil rights violation. To overcome qualified immunity, \"[t]he contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.\" <i>Anderson,</i> 483 U.S. at 640, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111953\"><a href=\"/opinion/111953/anderson-v-creighton/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The other aspect focuses more concretely on the facts of the particular case and whether a reasonable defendant would have understood that his conduct violated the plaintiffs' constitutional rights. Indeed, \"[i]t is important to emphasize that this inquiry `must be undertaken in light of the specific context of the case, not as a broad general proposition.'\" <i>Brosseau,</i> 543 U.S. at 198, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137736\"><a href=\"/opinion/137736/brosseau-v-haugen/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Cognizant of both the contours of the allegedly infringed right and the particular facts of the case, \"[t]he relevant, dispositive inquiry in determining whether a right is clearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.\" <i>Id.</i> at 199, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137736\"><a href=\"/opinion/137736/brosseau-v-haugen/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

While the substance of our three-part test has been faithful to the substance of the Court's two-part test, we owe fidelity to the Court's articulation of the test as well. And so we now adopt the Court's two-part test and abandon our previous usage of a three-step analysis.</p>\n<p>This we can do without invoking an en banc court given the intervention of the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Pearson.

Courts have discretion to decide whether, on the facts of a particular case, it is worthwhile to address first whether the facts alleged make out a violation of a constitutional right.</p>\n<p>As <i>Pearson</i> explained, the primary motivation behind <i>Saucier</i>'s sequential two-step rule was to promote the development of constitutional precedent. 129 S.Ct. at 816. Of course, there may be instances where \"a discussion of why the relevant facts do not violate clearly established law... make[s] it apparent that in fact the relevant facts do not make out a constitutional violation at all,\" <i>id.</i> at 818, making it worthwhile to address the first prong of the qualified immunity analysis.</p>\n<p>But in some cases, discussion of the first prong of the qualified immunity analysis will result \"in a substantial expenditure of scarce judicial resources on difficult questions that have no effect on the outcome of the case.\" <i>Id.</i> This expenditure of resources by the courts and the parties is difficult to justify in cases where the constitutional questions presented are heavily fact-bound, minimizing their precedential value. <i>Id.</i> at 819.</p>\n<p>Further, the utility of bypassing the first prong is particularly apparent \"[w]hen qualified immunity is asserted at the pleading stage [because] the precise factual basis for the plaintiff's claim or claims may be hard to identify.\" <i>Id.</i> Indeed, as this circuit has held, and <i>Pearson</i> recognized, where the answer to the first prong of the immunity question may depend on the further development of the facts, it may be wise to avoid the first step. <i>See id.</i> (citing <i>Buchanan v. Maine,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">158</span></span>, 168 (1st Cir.2006)). The Mayor here has chosen not to wait, but to press the Fourth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment issues at the pleadings stage, and then to appeal, in part, the denial of qualified immunity on the pleadings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Application of Qualified Immunity Analysis to the Fourth Amendment Claim</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The Mayor argues that the complaint fails to state a cognizable constitutional claim under the Fourth Amendment because that Amendment does not provide protection to individuals in their ownership of household pets under these circumstances. The first part of the Mayor's argument is essentially that taking plaintiffs' assertions in the complaint as true, the complaint still fails to state a Fourth Amendment claim.</p>\n<p>An individual's interest in his pet cat or dog does fall within the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of unreasonable seizures, though we have not addressed the question before. As the Fourth Circuit's decision in <i>Altman v. City of High Point,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"782092\"><a href=\"/opinion/782092/ann-altman-robert-altman-kimberly-larsen-wendy-frye-gilbert/\"><span class=\"volume\">330</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></a></span> (4th Cir.2003), establishes, privately owned pet dogs do qualify as property, such that pets are \"effects\" under the seizure clause of the Fourth Amendment.<sup>[2]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 202-04. We rely on and do not repeat Judge Luttig's scholarly analysis that dogs are \"effects\" for purposes <span class=\"star-pagination\">*271</span> of being secure from unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p>The killing of a person's pet dog or cat by the government without the person's consent is also a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. Three other circuits had announced this conclusion well before the violations alleged here. <i>See </i><i>Brown v. Muhlenberg Twp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775324\"><a href=\"/opinion/775324/kim-brown-david-brown-hw-v-muhlenberg-township-board-of-supervisors-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">269</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">205</span></a></span>, 210 (3d Cir.2001); <i>Fuller v.

Since then, the Seventh Circuit has also held that the killing of a companion dog is a Fourth Amendment seizure. <i>See </i><i>Viilo v.

No circuit court has held otherwise.</p>\n<p>We reject the Mayor's argument that this law was not clearly established because <i>this</i> court had not earlier addressed the questions of effects and seizure. Against the widespread acceptance of these points in the federal circuit courts, the Mayor's argument fails. These are principles of law, and the law was sufficiently recognized by courts to be clearly established. <i>See </i><i>Wilson v.

He reasons that there is a diminished expectation of privacy in pet ownership, and that diminished interest routinely must give way to public safety and health concerns. The Mayor argues that the plaintiffs' privacy interest in their pets was particularly diminished here because the residents had \"voluntarily subscribed\" to the pet policy through their lease agreements. Given the state's interest in collecting stray animals, the plaintiffs' \"voluntary\" subscription to the pet policy, and the Municipality's decision to collect strays and accept non-conforming pets only with advance notice, the Mayor argues that he could reasonably believe that his actions did not violate the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p>The Mayor's version of what happened is, however, inconsistent with the factual allegations of the complaint, which we must take as true. Starting with the pet policy, the inferences from the complaint are that the terms of the pet policy were not part of plaintiffs' leases, and were imposed after the fact and without the residents' consent. A reasonable inference from the complaint is that the pet policy was new to the residents of these three public housing complexes and was unilaterally imposed by the Mayor on October 1. These are material disputes of fact as to when the pet policy was first applied to plaintiffs and the circumstances under which it was applied. The Mayor says these disputes are immaterial by pointing to 42 U.S.C. § 1437z-3, a public health and welfare law covering pet ownership in public housing complexes. But that statute works against the Mayor for it authorizes public housing residents to own common household pets \"subject to the reasonable requirements of the public housing agency.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*272</span> <i>Id.</i> § 1437z-3(a).<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>The residents also complain about the manner in which they were notified of the policy, and their lack of an opportunity to object. The residents are predominantly Spanish speaking; yet the Municipality provided the pet policy to them only in English. The notice on its face did not provide any opportunity to object to the policy. Nor did the notice say when the policy would be enforced. And the short length of time between the residents' receipt of the notice and the policy's enforcement, the plaintiffs allege, provided them with insufficient opportunity to find humane solutions for any pets which they had to relinquish.</p>\n<p>We cannot say on the basis of the pleadings alone that an objective official in the Mayor's position, as a matter of law, would have reasonably concluded his actions in implementing and executing the pet policy were not a violation of the Fourth Amendment. The district court was correct to deny the Mayor qualified immunity on the Fourth Amendment claims based on the pleadings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Application of Qualified Immunity Analysis to the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Claims</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The Mayor has waived any appeal from the denial of qualified immunity as to the Fourteenth Amendment <i>procedural</i> due process claims by failing to brief it.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>The plaintiffs have also alleged Fourteenth Amendment <i>substantive</i> due process violations, and the Mayor does appeal from the denial of qualified immunity as to those claims. Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process claims often turn on whether the alleged misconduct \"shocks the conscience.\" <i>See </i><i>Espinoza v. Sabol,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">558</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></span>, 87 (1st Cir.2009) (\"The substantive component of the Due Process Clause is violated by executive action `when it can properly be characterized as arbitrary, or conscience shocking, in a constitutional sense.'\" (quoting <i>County of Sacramento v. Lewis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118214\"><a href=\"/opinion/118214/countyof-sacramento-v-lewis/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">833</span></a></span>, 847, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118214\"><a href=\"/opinion/118214/countyof-sacramento-v-lewis/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1043</span></a></span> (1998))).</p>\n<p>The Mayor's primary argument that he is entitled to immunity is that a \"shock the conscience\" violation against him or other municipal officials is not stated on the face of the complaint because such a claim cannot arise as to the treatment of animals. He makes a cursory argument that such a claim may be stated only as to the treatment of people and that the treatment of animals must be left to state law. But the language of the Fourteenth Amendment is that a state shall not \"deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1. The Fourteenth Amendment protects against certain deprivations of people's property, and \"property\" encompasses people's pet cats and dogs.</p>\n<p>The Mayor's argument continues that the substantive due process \"shock the conscience\" caselaw does not apply in situations of deprivation of property, but only to deprivations of the life and/or liberty of a person. This argument, we think, ignores the language of the Amendment. It is the <i>effect</i> on the person from the deprivation of the interest in life, liberty, or property which may be \"shocking to the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*273</span> conscience,\" and perhaps beyond the constitutional pale. We see no reason to read the word \"property\" out of the Amendment; we would be reluctant to conclude that deprivations of property cannot ever be so shocking in their effect on the person as to lead to a Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process violation. <i>Cf. </i><i>Clark v. Boscher,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203125\"><a href=\"/opinion/203125/clark-v-boscher/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span>, 112-13 (1st Cir.2008) (considering an alleged substantive due process violation involving the deprivation of property but recognizing that \"the substantive due process doctrine may not, in the ordinary course, be invoked to challenge\" the type of misconduct alleged (quoting <i>Mongeau v. City of Marlborough,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202812\"><a href=\"/opinion/202812/mongeau-v-city-of-marlborough/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.2007))).</p>\n<p>Yet it is also true that the Supreme Court has been firm in its reluctance to expand the doctrine of substantive due process. <i>See </i><i>Chavez,</i> 538 U.S. at 775, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127927\"><a href=\"/opinion/127927/chavez-v-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1994</span></a></span>. Indeed, it is because of this resistance toward expanding the reach of substantive due process that the official conduct \"most likely to rise to the conscience-shocking level\" is \"conduct intended to injure in some way unjustifiable by any government interest.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Lewis,</i> 523 U.S. at 849, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118214\"><a href=\"/opinion/118214/countyof-sacramento-v-lewis/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1708</span></a></span>) (internal quotation marks omitted). While there is reason for skepticism about the plaintiffs' theory, we are reluctant to resolve at this point the question of whether the government had an interest sufficient to justify the cruel killing of household pets arbitrarily seized from their owners, even if the government ultimately had a legitimate interest in restricting ownership of pet cats and dogs in public housing. We do not need to render what would essentially be an advisory opinion on these precise arguments by the Mayor that a substantive due process claim may never be stated as to the arbitrary and cruel seizure and killing of pets. <i>See </i><i>Pearson,</i> 129 S.Ct. at 818.</p>\n<p>Instead, we resolve the qualified immunity issue in the Mayor's favor under <i>Pearson</i>'s first prong for different reasons. That is, analyzing the pleadings under <i>Iqbal,</i> we hold that the allegations of the complaint do not allege a sufficient connection between the Mayor and the alleged conscience-shocking behaviorthe killing of the seized petsto state the elements of a substantive due process violation.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>The purported liability of the Mayor for damages for substantive due process violations does not involve a policy of the Municipality for which he is responsible, nor does it rest on his personal conduct. Instead, the allegations against the Mayor are that he promulgated a pet policy for the public housing complexes and was present at and participated in one of the raids. This level of involvement is insufficient to support a finding of liability.</p>\n<p>First, there is nothing conscience-shocking about the pet policy itself. The terms of the pet policy, for which the complaint holds the Mayor responsible, say nothing about how \"Prohibited Pets,\" which include cats and dogs, are to be removed from their owners or what happens thereafter to the pets. Plaintiffs complaint identifies no policy which authorized the killing of the pets, much less one which the Mayor authorized.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*274</span> Second, the complaint does not allege that the Mayor was personally involved in any conscience-shocking conduct during the raids. The complaint does allege that the Mayor was present during the first raid on October 8, 2007 and that he observed it. But he is not named as the individual who directly planned, supervised, and executed the raids of their aftermath; the complaint merely alleges that he supervised, directly or indirectly, the agencies involved. And there is no allegation the Mayor participated in the killing of any pet or directed the services of the private contractor.</p>\n<p>There is a generalized allegation that the Mayor planned, personally participated in, and executed the raids in concert with others, but the others are named as the persons with specific administrative responsibilities as to the public housing complexes. \"These bare assertions, much like the pleading of conspiracy in <i>Twombly,</i> amount to nothing more than a `formulaic recitation of the elements' of a constitutional [tort],\" <i>Iqbal,</i> at 1951 (quoting <i>Twombly,</i> 550 U.S. at 555, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145730\"><a href=\"/opinion/145730/bell-atlantic-corp-v-twombly/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1955</span></a></span>), and are insufficient to push the plaintiffs' claim beyond the pleadings stage. Moreover, the complaint alleges, without any more details, that the Mayor was among all the other public and private employees \"snatching pets from owners.\" Although these bare allegations may be \"consistent with\" a finding of liability against the Mayor for seizure of the same pets, such allegations \"stop[] short of the line between possibility and plausibility of `entitlement to relief'\" on the larger substantive due process claim. <i>Iqbal,</i> at 1960 (quoting <i>Twombly,</i> 550 U.S. at 557, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145730\"><a href=\"/opinion/145730/bell-atlantic-corp-v-twombly/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1955</span></a></span>) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>A government official who himself inflicts truly outrageous, uncivilized, and intolerable harm on a person or his property may be liable; but there is no claim in this complaint the Mayor himself inflicted such harm. <i>Cf. </i><i>Velez-Diaz v. Vega-Irizarry,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201798\"><a href=\"/opinion/201798/velez-diaz-v-vega-irizarry/\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span>, 79 (1st Cir.2005) (granting qualified immunity where there was no allegation that the government actors were directly involved in the offensive conduct). The allegations against the Mayor thus do not establish that his involvement was sufficiently direct to hold him liable for violations of the plaintiffs' substantive due process rights.</p>\n<p>Nor do the allegations make out a viable case for supervisory liability, such that the Mayor could, on these pleadings, be held responsible for violations of the plaintiffs' substantive due process rights committed by subordinate municipal employees or workers from ACS.<sup>[7]</sup><i>See </i><i>Estate of Bennett,</i> 548 F.3d at 176-77 (explaining <span class=\"star-pagination\">*275</span> that supervisory liability for alleged substantive due process violations requires a showing of \"supervisory encouragement, condonation or acquiescence or gross negligence amounting to deliberate indifference\" (quoting <i>Pineda v.

Indeed, supervisory liability lies only where an \"`affirmative link' between the behavior of a subordinate and the action or inaction of his supervisor\" exists such that \"`the supervisor's conduct led inexorably to the constitutional violation.'\" <i>Pineda,</i> 533 F.3d at 54 (quoting <i>Hegarty v.

Here, the Mayor's promulgation of a pet policy that was silent as to the manner in which the pets were to be collected and disposed of, coupled with his mere presence at one of the raids, is insufficient to create the affirmative link necessary for a finding of supervisory liability, even under a theory of deliberate indifference. The Mayor is entitled to qualified immunity on the pleadings on the Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process claims.</p>\n<p>We note that the Mayor has denied many of the factual allegations asserted in the complaint. Nothing in this opinion precludes the Mayor from seeking qualified immunity on a further developed record at a later stage.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>The district court's order denying the Mayor qualified immunity as to the plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment procedural due process claims is <i>affirmed.</i> The district court's order denying the Mayor qualified immunity as to the plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process claims is <i>reversed,</i> and the plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process claims are <i>dismissed.</i> Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The Mayor also moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim, which the district court granted as to a few claims, but denied as to the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment claims and pendent state law claims.

That issue was not before the court, and it could make no such findings at this stage in the litigation.</p>\n<p>[6]  The complaint alleges that an informal policy emerged from the repeating of the raids.

We reject such \"`naked assertion[s]' devoid of `further factual enhancement.'\" <i>Iqbal,</i> at 1950 (alteration in original) (quoting <i>Twombly,</i> 550 U.S. at 557, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145730\"><a href=\"/opinion/145730/bell-atlantic-corp-v-twombly/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1955</span></a></span>).</p>\n<p>[7]  Some recent language from the Supreme Court may call into question our prior circuit law on the standard for holding a public official liable for damages under § 1983 on a theory of supervisory liability. <i>See Iqbal,</i> at 1948 (\"Because vicarious liability is inapplicable to <i>Bivens</i> and § 1983 suits, a plaintiff must plead that each Government-official defendant, through the official's own individual actions, has violated the Constitution.\"). We need not resolve this issue, however, because we find that the plaintiffs have not pled facts sufficient to make out a plausible entitlement to relief under our previous formulation of the standards for supervisory liability.</p>\n\n</div>",
