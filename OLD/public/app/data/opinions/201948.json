Plaintiff Judy Morris\n\nappeals     the      district    court’s       denial       of    her    motion        for\n\nreconsideration.        The district court entered judgment for Morris\n\nunder the Employee Retirement and Insurance Security Act, 29 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 1001-1461, granting her two years of payments on her claim for\n\nmental disability.        It denied her claim for benefits for long-term\n\ndisability based on chronic fatigue syndrome.                    Morris did not file\n\na timely notice of appeal from the judgment.                     Instead, she filed\n\ntwo post-judgment motions attacking the court’s decision, which the\n\ncourt denied.1        Because Morris has not shown that the district\n\ncourt abused its discretion, we affirm the court’s judgment.\n\n                                PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n              On March 23, 2004, the district court issued a Memorandum\n\nand   Order    awarding    Morris       two   years    of   benefits       for   mental\n\ndisability     but    denying     her    claim   for    benefits        for    physical\n\ndisability.       On the same day, the court entered judgment pursuant\n\nto the Order, awarding Morris $231,214.82.                  Morris did not appeal\n\nthe judgment but instead filed a motion for reconsideration on\n\nApril 5, within the ten-day period allowed by Federal Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure     59(e).2      The    district     court    denied      that      motion    on\n\n\n      1\n      In addition to two motions for reconsideration, Morris filed\na motion titled “Plaintiff’s Motion for Extension and Enlargement\nof Time for Filing of Postjudgment Motions; Request for Hearing\n(Preferably By Telephone); and Other Matters” that did not directly\nchallenge the court’s March 23, 2004 decision.\n      2\n      Plaintiff styled her motion “Request for Judicial Notice of\nDisability and Preliminary Request for Reconsideration of the\nCourt’s March 23, 2004 Verdict. Request for a Hearing as an\n\fApril 21, but also granted Morris until May 28, 2004, “for the\n\nfiling of any further post-judgment motions.”     On May 28, Morris\n\ninformed the district court that she would be unable to file her\n\npost-judgment motions before June 1.      On that day she filed a\n\nvoluminous motion for reconsideration.3   The district court denied\n\nthat motion on October 21 and the next day entered a second\n\njudgment “pursuant to the Memorandum and Order of the Court entered\n\nOctober 21, 2004.”4   On November 5, Morris timely filed a notice of\n\nappeal “from the October 21, 2004 decision.”\n\n          Morris has not appealed the merits judgment of March 23,\n\n2004.    The question is whether the denial of her motions for\n\nreconsideration was an abuse of discretion.\n\n                             DISCUSSION\n\n          Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) provides that\n\n“[a]ny motion to alter or amend a judgment shall be filed no later\n\nthan 10 days after entry of the judgment.”      That time limit is\n\nmandatory.   See Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(b) stating that\n\nthe court “may not extend the time for taking any action under\n\n\nAccommodation for My Disability.”\n     3\n      The motion was styled: “Motion/Memorandum/Affidavit in\nSupport of Judgment as a Matter of Law, and/or New (Non-Jury)\nTrial, and/or Reconsideration, and/or Alteration or Amendment to\nCourt’s March 23, 2004 Final Judgment with Addition or Amendment to\nCourt’s Findings of Fact and Case Precident [sic] as Required by\nLaw.”\n     4\n      The entry of a second judgment by the District Court clerk\nwas presumably a clerical error.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fRule[] . . . 59(e).”     It leaves the district court with “no power\n\nor discretion to modify it.”     Vargas v. Gonzalez, 975 F.2d 916, 917\n\n(1st   Cir.    1992).   An   untimely    motion    for   reconsideration   is\n\ntherefore a nullity, at least for purposes of Rule 59(e).          Flint v.\n\nHoward, 464 F.2d 1084, 1086        (1st Cir. 1972) (citing Jusino v.\n\nMorales & Tio, 139 F.2d 946 (1st Cir. 1944)).\n\n              Morris’s April 5 motion for reconsideration was filed\n\nwithin the Rule 59(e) ten-day deadline.           See Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a).\n\nMorris did not appeal the April 21 denial of that motion, choosing\n\ninstead to file a renewed motion for post-judgment relief. Even if\n\nthe court’s April 21 order were construed as leave to file further\n\npost-judgment motions, the court was without power to entertain a\n\nfurther Rule 59 motion.       See Feinstein v. Moses, 951 F.2d 16, 19\n\n(1st Cir. 1991) (holding that district court lacks power to enlarge\n\ntime to file Rule 59(e) motion).        The June 1 motion, therefore, was\n\na nullity for Rule 59(e) purposes and the district court was\n\nwithout jurisdiction to grant it.            Air Line Pilots Ass’n v.\n\nPrecision Valley Aviation, Inc., 26 F.3d 220, 224 (1st Cir. 1994);\n\nVargas, 975 F.2d at 918.\n\n              The Supreme Court has acknowledged a limited exception\n\nallowing otherwise untimely appeals from post-judgment motions in\n\n“unique circumstances.” Thompson v. INS, 375 U.S. 384, 387 (1964);\n\nAir Line Pilots Ass’n, 26 F.3d at 225.        The district court’s order\n\nallowing further post-judgment motions to be filed until May 28,\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\f2004, however, did not excuse Morris’s late filing of her notice of\n\nappeal. First, this Circuit has questioned the continued viability\n\nof the Thompson doctrine.     Davignon v. Clemmey, 322 F.3d 1, 10\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).    Second, even if the doctrine remains viable, the\n\ndistrict court’s order did not create a “unique circumstance.”\n\n“[C]ourts generally have insisted on the requirement that the\n\ndoctrine applies only where a court has affirmatively assured a\n\nparty that its appeal will be timely.”     United States v. Heller,\n\n957 F.2d 26, 29 (1st Cir. 1992) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThe district court gave no such assurance.      The April 21 Order,\n\nwhich merely gave leave to file “post-judgment motions,” did not\n\nrelieve Morris from the Rule 59(e) deadline.\n\n     Even if we were to view Morris’s motion as having been timely\n\nmade under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b), as we may, see\n\nUnited States v. One Urban Lot, 882 F.2d 582, 584-85 (1st Cir.\n\n1989), the outcome would be the same.     The June 1 motion did not\n\nassert any of the grounds for relief from judgment listed in\n\nRule 60(b).\n\n     Although we do not reach the merits, our review of the record\n\npersuades us nonetheless that Morris’s brief is totally lacking in\n\nany demonstration of error below and that “this is not a case where\n\ntechnical rules have immunized a miscarriage of justice.”    Flint,\n\n464 F.2d at 1087.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f                 CONCLUSION\n\nThe judgment is affirmed.\n\nAffirmed\n\n\n\n\n                     -6-\n\f",

On that day she filed a voluminous motion for reconsideration.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The district court denied that motion on October 21 and the next day entered a second judgment \"pursuant to the Memorandum and Order of the Court entered October 21, 2004.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> On November 5, Morris timely filed a notice of appeal \"from the October 21, 2004 decision.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morris has not appealed the merits judgment of March 23, 2004.

See Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(b) stating that the court \"may not extend the time for taking any action under Rule[] ... 59(e).\" It leaves the district court with \"no power or discretion to modify it.\" <i>Vargas v.

An untimely motion for reconsideration is therefore a nullity, at least for purposes of Rule 59(e). <i>Flint v.

Morris did not appeal the April 21 denial of that motion, choosing instead to file a renewed motion for post-judgment relief. Even if the court's April 21 order were construed as leave to file further post-judgment motions, the court was without power to entertain a further Rule 59 motion. <i>See Feinstein v. Moses,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573153\"><a href=\"/opinion/573153/frederick-feinstein-v-morris-and-joyce-moses-dba-sun-cal-products/\"><span class=\"volume\">951</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 19 (1st Cir.1991) (holding that district court lacks power to enlarge time to file Rule 59(e) motion). The June 1 motion, therefore, was a nullity for Rule 59(e) purposes and the district court was without jurisdiction to grant it. <i>Air Line Pilots Ass'n v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">404</span></a></span> (1964); <i>Air Line Pilots Ass'n,</i> 26 F.3d at 225. The district court's order allowing further post-judgment motions to be filed until May 28, 2004, however, did not excuse Morris's late filing of her notice of appeal. First, this Circuit has questioned the continued viability of the <i>Thompson</i> doctrine. <i>Davignon v. Clemmey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781156\"><a href=\"/opinion/781156/neal-davignon-and-patricia-kelley-plaintiffs-appelleescross-appellants/\"><span class=\"volume\">322</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir.2003). Second, even if the doctrine remains viable, the district court's order did not create a \"unique circumstance.\" \"[C]ourts generally have insisted on the requirement that the doctrine applies only where a court has affirmatively assured a party that its appeal will be timely.\" <i>United States v. Heller,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578200\"><a href=\"/opinion/578200/energy-mgt-p-26666-united-states-of-america-v-glenn-martin-heller-dba/\"><span class=\"volume\">957</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 29 (1st Cir.1992) (internal quotation marks omitted). The district court gave no such assurance. The April 21 Order, which merely gave leave to file \"post-judgment motions,\" did not relieve Morris from the Rule 59(e) deadline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we were to view Morris's motion as having been timely made under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b), as we may, <i>see United States v.
