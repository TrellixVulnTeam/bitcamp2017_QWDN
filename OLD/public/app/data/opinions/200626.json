Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                         Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n                 Torruella and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Thomas L. Goodwin, with whom Strike, Goodwin & O'Brien was on\nbrief, for appellant.\n     Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, with whom Paula D.\nSilsby, United States Attorney, was on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          September 4, 2003\n\f               TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.             Defendant Barry S. May was\n\ncharged with two conspiracy counts: involvement in a conspiracy to\n\ndistribute cocaine and involvement in a conspiracy to distribute\n\nmarijuana.       May pled guilty to the marijuana count and as part of\n\nhis plea agreement the cocaine count was dismissed.                           Now May\n\nappeals, arguing that the district court erroneously augmented his\n\nsentence when it found (1) a kilogram of cocaine attributable to\n\nMay,     (2) his co-conspirator used a dangerous weapon, (3) May had\n\na   leadership     role     in   the     offense,    and   (3)    three   misdemeanor\n\nconvictions should be included as part of May's criminal history.\n\nAfter careful review, we affirm.\n\n                                    I.      Background\n\n               May and Scott Barbour began to obtain and distribute\n\nmarijuana in Texas, Florida, and Maine in 1996.                    Over time, others\n\njoined    in    the    marijuana         distribution,     with    May    heading   the\n\noperation in Maine.\n\n               Typically, Barbour and others purchased marijuana in\n\nTexas and shipped it to May and others for distribution in Maine.\n\nMay    retained       his   share      of    the   proceeds      and   forwarded    the\n\nappropriate share to Barbour and others in Texas.\n\n               In February 2000, May aided Barbour in the collection of\n\n$10,000 in drug debts.           At Barbour's trial, May testified that he\n\nwent to Texas to collect a debt owed by two men for some marijuana\n\nthey had \"strong armed\" from Barbour.                    May, co-conspirator Shane\n\n\n                                             -2-\n\fHall, and Barbour got drunk and went to Hall's house, where Hall\n\nobtained a .38 caliber pistol; the three then went looking for the\n\ndebtors.\n\n           In May 2000, Barbour sent May a package containing one\n\nkilogram of cocaine.    No cocaine had previously been involved in\n\nthe marijuana distribution conspiracy, and Barbour had not told May\n\nthat cocaine was being sent on this occasion.         According to May,\n\nthe receipt of the cocaine was unexpected and unwanted; May had\n\nbeen treated in 1989-90 for cocaine addiction, and knew proximity\n\nto the drug posed a danger of relapse.        When he realized Barbour\n\nhad sent him cocaine, not marijuana, he communicated his anger to\n\nBarbour in Texas and to two other conspirators in Maine, Steven\n\nCase and Kevin Woodward.         He told the three men that he wanted\n\nnothing to do with cocaine and that he was withdrawing from the\n\nmarijuana conspiracy.\n\n           The   kilogram   of    cocaine   was   divided   into   smaller\n\nquantities, and May gave seventeen ounces to Case, ten to Woodward,\n\nand retained seven ounces for himself.        May established terms of\n\npayment for the cocaine. Fearing access to cocaine would cause him\n\nto return to his former drug habit, May later gave his seven ounces\n\nto Woodward.\n\n           May denied having anything to do with distributing the\n\ncocaine after its receipt and division. He also denied both paying\n\nfor the cocaine and accepting payment for Barbour.\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f            In spite of his statements to his co-conspirators, May\n\ndid not immediately withdraw from the marijuana conspiracy.       He\n\ncontinued to receive and distribute marijuana (but not cocaine)\n\nfrom Texas, primarily from one Todd Massey.    As part of the ongoing\n\nconspiracy, there was a further shipment to Maine of forty-two\n\nounces of cocaine, but this went directly to Case without May's\n\nknowledge or participation.\n\n            On October 16, 2001, a federal grand jury indicted May\n\nand Barbour on two counts of conspiracy.      Count One alleged that\n\nbetween January 1, 1999 and October 1, 2001, May and Barbour\n\nconspired to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute at\n\nleast 500 grams of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1)\n\nand 846 (\"the cocaine count\").    Count Two alleged that during the\n\nsame time period May and Barbour conspired to distribute and to\n\npossess with intent to distribute more than fifty kilograms of\n\nmarijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841 (a)(1), 841 (b)(1)(C),\n\nand 846 (\"the marijuana count\").\n\n            On January 2, 2002, May pled guilty to the marijuana\n\ncount.   The plea agreement provided that the maximum statutory\n\nsentence was twenty years' imprisonment under 21 U.S.C. § 841\n\n(b)(1)(C).    The government agreed to move to dismiss the cocaine\n\ncount after sentencing on the marijuana count.     The plea agreement\n\ndid   not    contain   stipulations    for    sentencing   guidelines\n\ncalculations.\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f          Prior to sentencing, the parties stipulated that the\n\nquantity of marijuana attributable to May as relevant offense\n\nconduct was between 700 and 1,000 kilograms, corresponding to an\n\noffense level of thirty.        The parties disagreed as to whether any\n\ncocaine should be counted as relevant offense conduct, whether\n\nthere should be a deadly weapon enhancement, and whether three\n\nmisdemeanors    should     be    included   in    the    criminal     history\n\ncalculation.    These questions were submitted to the district court\n\nfor determination at the sentencing hearing.1\n\n          The   district    court    accepted    the    stipulation   of   the\n\nparties regarding marijuana quantity, and attributed one kilogram\n\nof cocaine to May as relevant offense conduct.2            This attribution\n\n\n1\n    At the sentencing hearing, the district court heard the\ntestimony of defense counsel, the government, and May.          In\naddition, the district court judge could take into account the\ntestimony from the Barbour trial, over which he presided and of\nwhich a transcript was submitted as evidence at the sentencing\nhearing.    Along with the presentence report, these are all\nappropriate sources of facts at sentencing. Cf. United States v.\nGarafano, 36 F.3d 133, 135 (1st Cir. 1994) (\"Normally the trial\ncourt makes its own assessment of the facts that pertain to\nsentencing, drawing on trial evidence, the presentence report, any\nevidence offered at the hearing, and other appropriate sources.\");\nsee also United States v. Sklar, 920 F.2d 107, 110 (1st Cir. 1990)\n(indicating rules of evidence do not apply at sentencing and that\nthe court may consider \"virtually any dependable information\").\n2\n   The government had argued for attribution of an additional\nforty-two ounces of cocaine, but the district court made no finding\nabout that quantity since it would not change the offense level\nunder the guidelines.\n\n   The district court determined that May had been \"effectively in\njoint possession, constructive possession of [the kilogram of]\ncocaine at the time,\" and accordingly held him responsible for it.\n\n                                    -5-\n\fresulted in raising the base offense level from level thirty to\n\nlevel thirty-two. The district court imposed upward adjustments of\n\nfour levels for role in the offense and two levels for possession\n\nof a firearm, and a downward adjustment of three levels for\n\nacceptance of responsibility, resulting in an adjusted offense\n\nlevel   of   thirty-five.             May's   criminal        history       category   was\n\ndetermined to be Category III, based on the inclusion of, among\n\nother   past       offenses,     convictions          for     the    misdemeanors       of\n\nterrorizing, assault, and criminal mischief. Offense level thirty-\n\nfive and criminal history Category III combined to produce a\n\nguidelines range of 210 – 262 months.\n\n             Upon    the   government's           §   5K1.1    motion       for   downward\n\ndeparture, the district court departed downward and sentenced May\n\nto 174 months' imprisonment, to be followed by three years of\n\nsupervised release.          May now appeals the sentence.\n\n                                      II.   Analysis\n\n             May    argues      the    sentencing       court       erred    in   several\n\nrespects.     First, May argues that the drug quantity determination\n\nwas erroneous because the kilogram of cocaine should not have been\n\nattributed     to   him    as   relevant      offense       conduct.         Second,   May\n\nquestions the enhancement for a co-conspirator's possession of a\n\n\n\nThe district court went on to say, \"you did not distance yourself\nenough from it, although I understand emotionally in your mind, you\nthink you did, you did not take part in it. But so far as the law\nis concerned, you are responsible for that.\"\n\n                                            -6-\n\fdeadly   weapon,   claiming   that    such   possession   is   not   always\n\nreasonably foreseeable during an attempt to collect a drug-related\n\ndebt.    Third, May posits that the district court erred in finding\n\nMay to be a leader or organizer.             Finally, May believes the\n\ndistrict court erred in including three misdemeanors as part of his\n\ncriminal history.    We address each argument in turn.3\n\nA.   Drug Quantity\n\n            Under the United States Sentencing Guidelines, a court is\n\nto consider all relevant conduct in determining the quantity of\n\ndrugs for which a defendant is responsible.        U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3.      A\n\npreponderance of the evidence standard applies to the determination\n\nof drug quantity, United States v. Caba, 241 F.3d 98, 101 (1st Cir.\n\n2001), and a sentencing court’s drug quantity determination is a\n\nfactual matter that will not be disturbed on appeal unless it is\n\nclearly erroneous.    United States v. Innamorati, 996 F.2d 456, 489\n\n(1st Cir. 1993).\n\n           A defendant may be held \"responsible for drug quantities\n\nwhich [he himself] sold, transported or negotiated\" as part of a\n\n\n\n3\n   Only the first issue was briefed by counsel and addressed at\noral arguments, but May raised the others in his pro se brief.\nMay's additional argument regarding the existence of two separate\nconspiracies fails because this Court presumes conspiracies exist\nabsent an affirmative showing of their termination. United States\nv. Elwell, 984 F.2d 1289, 1293 (1st Cir. 1993). The argument that\nthe inclusion of the cocaine constituted an amendment of the\nindictment is similarly doomed. Cf. United States v. Reyes, 3 F.3d\n29 (1st Cir. 1993) (upholding inclusion as relevant conduct of drug\ntransactions that were initially charged but dropped).\n\n                                     -7-\n\fconspiracy.     United States v. Miranda-Santiago, 96 F.3d 517, 524\n\n(1st Cir. 1996).      In addition, a defendant is accountable for\n\n\"reasonably   foreseeable    quantities     of   contraband.\"       U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 1B1.3, cmt. n.2.     In this case, the sentencing court found May\n\nresponsible for a kilogram of cocaine not because May had any\n\n\"reason to foresee the cocaine was going to turn up\" but rather\n\nbecause he was \"effectively in joint possession, constructive\n\npossession of that cocaine.\"        The court remarked on May's failure\n\nto act after receiving the cocaine, stating:\n\n          You could have left right then. You could have\n          turned it in. You didn't do any of that.\n          Instead, you stayed. You went with it and were\n          there to see it broken up and ultimately, went\n          into the distribution channels. And you were\n          effectively in joint possession, constructive\n          possession of the cocaine at the time, and you\n          are responsible for it.\n\n          The    court's    conclusion     regarding    May's     joint   and\n\nconstructive possession of the cocaine is well-supported by the\n\nrecord.   According    to   May's    own   statement   at   his   sentencing\n\nhearing, he was present when Woodward and Case divided the kilogram\n\nof cocaine into smaller amounts for further distribution. Further,\n\nMay personally distributed cocaine to Case and Woodward, and had\n\nseven ounces in his own possession for a period of time.                  See\n\nUnited States v. Georgacarakos, 988 F.2d 1289, 1296 (1st Cir. 1993)\n\n(\"Constructive possession exists if the defendant knows the drugs\n\nare available and has the power and intent to exercise dominion and\n\ncontrol over them.\"); see also United States v. Batista-Polanco,\n\n                                    -8-\n\f927 F.2d 14, 18-19 (1st Cir. 1991) (defendant sitting at table with\n\nothers while heroin was being packaged was in joint constructive\n\npossession of drug). Certainly, by personally transferring control\n\nof the cocaine to others and by having an amount of the drug in his\n\nown possession however briefly, May was \"directly involved\" with\n\nthe   drug,   which   suffices   to   hold   him   accountable   for   the\n\ncontraband.    See U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3, cmt. n.2.\n\n          Moreover, the delivery of the kilogram of cocaine alone\n\nwould have sufficed to render the cocaine relevant conduct to May.\n\nSee United States v. Young, 78 F.3d 758, 763 n.5 (1st Cir. 1996)\n\n(transactions involving different drugs but same conspirators and\n\na common scheme made both drugs relevant conduct).        May, Barbour,\n\nWoodward, and Case were all members of the same criminal enterprise\n\nthat had been distributing marijuana for almost four years.            The\n\nsame people and process were used for the cocaine as for the\n\nmarijuana, again reinforcing the district court's decision to\n\nattribute the cocaine to May.     See U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3, cmt. n.9(A);\n\nUnited States v. Wood, 924 F.2d 399, 404 (1st Cir. 1991) (taking\n\ninto account conduct that involved the same mode of distribution\n\nand transaction type as the charged drug offense).\n\n          Because of May's direct involvement with the handling of\n\nthe kilogram of cocaine and the use of the marijuana distribution\n\nsystem for the cocaine, we find that the district court's inclusion\n\nof the cocaine in the drug quantity was not clearly erroneous.\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fB.   Deadly Weapon Enhancement\n\n            May challenges the two-level enhancement for the presence\n\nof a gun, arguing that the district court erroneously held that it\n\nis foreseeable that guns will always be involved in the collection\n\nof drug debts.    Where only a guideline's application to the facts\n\nof a case is at issue, we review for clear error.   United States v.\n\nJackson, 3 F.3d 506, 509 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n            A two-level increase in offense level is mandated \"[i]f\n\na dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed\" in the\n\ncourse of a drug offense. U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(1). The enhancement\n\napplies \"if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable\n\nthat the weapon was connected with the offense.\"      Id., cmt. n.3.\n\nIn a conspiracy case, the government must first show that one of\n\nthe defendant's co-conspirators \"possessed a weapon during the\n\noffense.\"   United States v. Nelson-Rodríguez, 319 F.3d 12, 59 (1st\n\nCir. 2003).    Once the government demonstrates the possession of a\n\ngun, the burden is on the defendant to show that the connection\n\nbetween the gun and the drug crime was \"clearly improbable.\"     See\n\nJackson, 3 F.3d at 509.\n\n            In this case, the government demonstrated a gun was used\n\nin the course of the conspiracy.   May went to Texas to help Barbour\n\ncollect a marijuana debt.    One of May's co-conspirators brought a\n\n.38 caliber pistol along when they went to collect the debt; May's\n\ntestimony at Barbour's trial indicated he knew his co-conspirator\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fhad the gun.    May presented no evidence to show the improbability\n\nof the connection between the gun and the conspiracy.            Given May's\n\nfailure to show that the gun was likely not connected to the\n\nconspiracy, we cannot say that the district court erred in applying\n\nthe deadly weapon enhancement.\n\nC.   Role in the Offense\n\n           May also challenges the application of the four-level\n\nenhancement for being an \"organizer or leader of criminal activity\n\nthat   involved   five   or   more     participants   or   was    otherwise\n\nextensive.\"    U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1.     Application of this enhancement is\n\nreviewable only for clear error. United States v. Olivier-Díaz, 13\n\nF.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1993).    We have noted before that \"battles over\n\na defendant's status . . . will almost always be won or lost in the\n\ndistrict court\" because \"the assessment of the appellant's role in\n\nthe offense of conviction is factbound.\"         United States v. Conley,\n\n156 F.3d 78, 85 (1st Cir. 1998) (internal quotation omitted).\n\n           May concedes that he was a \"key player\" and a \"manager\"\n\nbut argues that he had a middleman role which should result in a\n\nthree-level managerial enhancement as opposed to a four-level\n\nenhancement for a leadership role.          Among the relevant factors in\n\ndetermining the role of a defendant are:\n\n           the exercise of decision making authority, the\n           nature of participation in the commission of\n           the offense, the recruitment of accomplices,\n           the claimed right to a larger share of the\n           fruits   of   the   crime,   the   degree   of\n           participation in planning or organizing the\n\n                                     -11-\n\f            offense, the nature and scope of the illegal\n            activity, and the degree of control and\n            authority exercised over others.\n\nU.S.S.G. § 3B1.1, cmt. n.4.\n\n            The record here provides ample support for the finding\n\nthat May was a leader or organizer of the marijuana conspiracy.\n\nThe conspiracy which May and Barbour instigated in 1996 involved at\n\nleast seventeen participants.     According to the presentence report\n\nand by May's own admission, May's role in the conspiracy included\n\nrecruiting participants to the conspiracy as well as strawmen in\n\nMaine to be used for delivery of the marijuana from Texas.            May\n\ncollected the marijuana from the delivery sites, took it to others,\n\nreceived payment, and divided the proceeds among the participants.\n\nHe was personally involved in the collection of drug debts, and\n\ntypically kept for himself a larger share of the proceeds than\n\nanyone except Barbour.     When Barbour was arrested in 2000, it was\n\nMay who took over the business with Massey.             The evidence at\n\nBarbour's trial showed that a co-conspirator identified May as the\n\nperson in charge of the Maine end of the operation and used the\n\npresent tense in giving that description.         Cf. Olivier-Díaz, 13\n\nF.3d at 5 (finding sufficient support for determination that\n\ndefendant was a leader or organizer where, among other things, he\n\nrecruited    others   to   distribute    the   drugs,   \"supervised   the\n\n\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\fcollection of debts,\" and oversaw the operations when two of his\n\nco-conspirators were in prison).4\n\n            On this evidence, the trial court's conclusion that May\n\nhad a leadership role, rather than a managerial one, cannot be said\n\nto be clearly erroneous.\n\nD.    Criminal History\n\n            May's final argument is that his criminal history score\n\nwas improperly calculated because the district court erroneously\n\ntook into account three convictions for misdemeanors.               He renews\n\nthe   argument   made    at   his    sentencing    hearing   that   the   three\n\nmisdemeanors are sufficiently similar to the crime of disorderly\n\nconduct to merit exclusion from the criminal history calculation.\n\n            A    sentencing         court     should   consider     felonies,\n\nmisdemeanors, and petty offenses for criminal history purposes\n\nunless the misdemeanor or petty offense falls within one of the\n\n\n4\n  May argues that the fact that the conspiracy stopped during part\nof Barbour's time in prison is evidence that it was Barbour and not\nMay who led the drug ring. First of all, the presentence report\nindicates that, while the conspiracy slowed during Barbour's\ninitial time in custody, it did continue. After a temporary hiatus\nin July 1998, May and Massey continued the distribution during\nanother of Barbour's stints in prison in 2000.       More than one\nperson can have a leadership role in a conspiracy. See U.S.S.G.\n§ 3B1.1, cmt. n.4 (\"There can, of course, be more than one person\nwho qualifies as a leader or organizer of a criminal association or\nconspiracy.\"); see also United States v. Andújar, 49 F.3d 16, 25\n(1st Cir. 1995) (affirming determination that defendant was a\nleader in spite of the fact that someone else was \"running the\nshow\" because the defendant was the ultimate organizer's \"personal\ncontact, or principal man, . . . and in that sense he was the\nleader, a leader and organizer\"). Here, May was Barbour's contact\nin Maine and led the operation in that state.\n\n                                       -13-\n\fexceptions provided by the guidelines.           U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2.      One\n\nexception provides that a conviction for disorderly conduct or a\n\n\"similar\" offense is \"counted only if (a) the sentence was a term\n\nof probation of at least one year or a term of imprisonment of at\n\nleast thirty days, or (B) the prior offense was similar to an\n\ninstant offense.\"    U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(c)(1).        The application of a\n\nguideline to the facts is reviewable for clear error.          See United\n\nStates v. Camilo, 71 F.3d 984, 986 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n           May contends that his 1989 conviction for terrorizing is\n\nsufficiently similar to disorderly conduct to be excluded from his\n\ncriminal history.     In that instance, May received a sixty day\n\nsuspended sentence and one year of probation.         Under the terms of\n\n§ 4A1.2(c)(1)(A), even if the crime was similar to disorderly\n\nconduct or any other enumerated crime, it would count towards\n\ncriminal history where \"the sentence was a term of probation of at\n\nleast one year.\"    See also United States v. Gray, 177 F.3d 86, 89\n\nn.1 (1st   Cir.   1999).   Thus,    the     terrorizing   misdemeanor   was\n\nproperly considered toward his criminal history.\n\n           Next, May argues his prior assault conviction was also\n\nsufficiently similar to the crime of disorderly conduct to qualify\n\nfor exclusion.     Relying on United States v. Unger, 915 F.2d 759\n\n(1st Cir. 1990), May argues that the court erred in considering the\n\nconduct involved in the assault.          He posits that the elements of\n\nthe crime are sufficiently similar to those of the crime of\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fdisorderly conduct, as defined by the Model Penal Code, to justify\n\nexclusion of the misdemeanor.\n\n          May's argument is flawed.    May misconstrues Unger, which\n\ndictates that courts consider not just the statutory elements of an\n\noffense as compared to those of an exception, but also \"the\n\nsubstance of the underlying state offense in order to determine\n\nwhether it falls within the proscription\" of § 4A1.2(c)(1)(A). 915\n\nF.2d at 763; see also United States v. Spaulding, 2003 U.S. App.\n\nLEXIS 15512, at *4 n.1 (1st Cir. Aug. 4, 2003) (applying Unger,\n\nwhich was about U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(c)(2), to cases involving U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 4A1.2(c)(1)).   Thus, the district court did not err in observing\n\nthat he \"knocked somebody down and kicked them\" and using the\n\nbehavior to distinguish the assault from disorderly conduct.\n\n          Assault is not one of the offenses enumerated in § 4A1.2\n\n(c)(1)(A), but we evaluate the similarity between it and the listed\n\noffense of disorderly conduct.     The statutory elements and the\n\npunishment provided for each offense are among the factors that\n\ndeserve comparison in the assessment of similarity.      See United\n\nStates v. Reyes-Maya, 305 F.3d 362, 366 (5th Cir. 2002).    The two\n\ncrimes, as defined by Maine law, are clearly different.         The\n\nassault statute requires physical injury or contact5 whereas the\n\n\n5\n  Under Maine's all-purpose assault statute, \"[a] person is guilty\nof assault if he intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causes\nbodily injury or offensive physical contact to another.\" Me. Rev.\nStat. Ann. tit. 17-A, § 207(1) (2003). By statute, bodily injury\nis defined as \"physical pain, physical illness or any impairment of\n\n                                -15-\n\fdisorderly    conduct       statute   is   simply     aimed    at     \"annoyance.\"6\n\nFurther, the maximum punishment for assault is twice that for\n\ndisorderly conduct.7        Thus, trying to draw a comparison between the\n\ntwo crimes is futile.\n\n             Similar   reasoning      applies    to   the     third    misdemeanor\n\nconviction.      First,      as   described     above,   the    court    correctly\n\nconsidered the conduct involved, which here included throwing beer\n\nbottles at a moving vehicle and continued damage even after the\n\nvehicle stopped. The court distinguished the conduct at issue from\n\nthat contemplated in disorderly conduct, saying:\n\n             if indeed you'd been throwing those bottles at\n             a wall where they just broke harmlessly, that\n             might have been disorderly conduct, but you\n             were throwing them at a moving vehicle. And\n             when it stopped, you jumped on and continued\n             to damage it. That distinguishes it from the\n             disorderly conduct . . . .\n\n             Second,    a   comparison     of   the   statutes        confirms   the\n\ninclusion of the misdemeanor in the criminal history.                     Criminal\n\nmischief is defined as the intentional, knowing, or reckless damage\n\n\nphysical condition.\" Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, § 2(5) (2003);\nsee also United States v. Nason, 269 F.3d 10, 18 (1st Cir. 2001).\n6\n    Maine's statute defines disorderly conduct as conduct that\n\"intentionally or recklessly causes annoyance to others\" by such\nmeans as \"making loud and unreasonable noises,\" causing \"noxious or\noffensive odors\" to be released, or fighting. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann.\ntit. 17-A, § 501 (2003).\n7\n   Assault is punishable by up to a year in prison, see Me. Rev.\nStat. Ann. tit. 17-A, § 1252(1)(D) (2003), whereas disorderly\nconduct is punishable by a maximum of six months in prison, see Me.\nRev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, § 1252(1)(E) (2003).\n\n                                      -16-\n\for destruction of another's property without a right to do so.       Me.\n\nRev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, § 806 (2003).            The misdemeanor is\n\npunishable by up to one year in prison.          See id; Me. Rev. Stat.\n\nAnn. tit. 17-A, § 1252(1)(D).         As discussed above, disorderly\n\nconduct involves but does not require destruction and is punishable\n\nby up to six months in prison.       Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, §\n\n501; Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, § 1252(1)(E).         We hold May's\n\ncriminal mischief constituted an offense that differed sufficiently\n\nfrom that of disorderly conduct to support its inclusion in the\n\ncriminal history computation.\n\n          The   district   court    calculated   the   criminal   history\n\ncategory properly by including all three misdemeanors.\n\n                           III.    Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the district court's judgment\n\nis affirmed.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\f",

May was charged with two conspiracy counts: involvement in a conspiracy to distribute cocaine and involvement in a conspiracy to distribute marijuana. May pled guilty to the marijuana count and as part of his plea agreement the cocaine count was dismissed. Now May appeals, arguing that the district court erroneously augmented his sentence when it found (1) a kilogram of cocaine attributable to May, (2) his co-conspirator used a dangerous weapon, (3) May had a leadership role in the offense, and (4) three misdemeanor convictions should be included as part of May's criminal history. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">May and Scott Barbour began to obtain and distribute marijuana in Texas, Florida, and Maine in 1996. Over time, others joined in the marijuana distribution, with May heading the operation in Maine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Typically, Barbour and others purchased marijuana in Texas and shipped it to May and others for distribution in Maine. May retained his share of the proceeds and forwarded the appropriate share to Barbour and others in Texas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 2000, May aided Barbour in the collection of $10,000 in drug debts. At Barbour's trial, May testified that he went to Texas to collect a debt owed by two men for some marijuana they had \"strong armed\" from Barbour. May, co-conspirator Shane Hall, and Barbour got drunk and went to Hall's house, where Hall obtained a .38 caliber pistol; the three then went looking for the debtors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 2000, Barbour sent May a package containing one kilogram of cocaine. No cocaine had previously been involved in the marijuana distribution conspiracy, and Barbour had not told May that cocaine was being sent on this occasion. According to May, the receipt of the cocaine was unexpected and unwanted; May had been treated in 1989-90 for cocaine addiction, and knew proximity to the drug posed a danger of relapse. When he realized Barbour had sent him cocaine, not marijuana, he communicated his anger to Barbour in Texas and to two other conspirators in Maine, Steven Case and Kevin Woodward. He told the three men that he wanted nothing to do with cocaine and that he was withdrawing from the marijuana conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The kilogram of cocaine was divided into smaller quantities, and May gave seventeen ounces to Case, ten to Woodward, and retained seven ounces for himself. May established terms of payment for the cocaine. Fearing access to cocaine would cause him to return to his former drug habit, May later gave his seven ounces to Woodward.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">May denied having anything to do with distributing the cocaine after its receipt and division. He also denied both paying for the cocaine and accepting payment for Barbour.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In spite of his statements to his co-conspirators, May did not immediately withdraw from the marijuana conspiracy. He continued to receive and distribute marijuana (but not cocaine) from Texas, primarily from one Todd Massey. As part of the ongoing conspiracy, there was a further shipment to Maine of forty-two ounces of cocaine, but this went directly to Case without May's knowledge or participation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 16, 2001, a federal grand jury indicted May and Barbour on two counts of conspiracy. Count One alleged that between January 1, 1999 and October 1, 2001, May and Barbour conspired to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute at least 500 grams of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1) and 846 (\"the cocaine count\"). Count Two alleged that during the same time period May and Barbour conspired to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute more than fifty kilograms of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(C), and 846 (\"the marijuana count\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 2, 2002, May pled guilty to the marijuana count. The plea agreement provided that the maximum statutory sentence was twenty years' imprisonment under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(C). The government agreed to move to dismiss the cocaine count after sentencing on the marijuana count. The plea agreement did not contain stipulations for sentencing guidelines calculations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to sentencing, the parties stipulated that the quantity of marijuana attributable to May as relevant offense conduct was between 700 and 1,000 kilograms, corresponding to an offense level of thirty. The parties disagreed as to whether any cocaine should be counted as relevant offense conduct, whether there should be a deadly weapon enhancement, and whether three misdemeanors should be included in the criminal history calculation. These questions were submitted to the district court for determination at the sentencing hearing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court accepted the stipulation of the parties regarding marijuana quantity, and attributed one kilogram of cocaine to May as relevant offense conduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> This attribution resulted in raising the base offense level from level thirty to level thirty-two. The district court imposed upward adjustments of four levels for role in the offense and two levels for possession of a firearm, and a downward adjustment of three levels for acceptance of responsibility, resulting in an adjusted offense level of thirty-five. May's criminal history category was determined to be Category III, based on the inclusion of, among other past offenses, convictions for the misdemeanors of terrorizing, assault, and criminal mischief. Offense level thirty-five and criminal history Category III combined to produce a guidelines range of 210-262 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon the government's &#167; 5K1.1 motion for downward departure, the district court departed downward and sentenced May to 174 months' imprisonment, to be followed by three years of supervised release. May now appeals the sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Analysis</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">May argues the sentencing court erred in several respects. First, May argues that the drug quantity determination was erroneous because the kilogram of cocaine should not have been attributed to him as relevant offense conduct. Second, May questions the enhancement for a co-conspirator's possession of a deadly weapon, claiming that such possession is not always reasonably foreseeable during an attempt to collect a drug-related debt. Third, May posits that the district court erred in finding May to be a leader or organizer. Finally, May believes the district court erred in including three misdemeanors as part of his criminal history. We address each argument in turn.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Drug Quantity</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the United States Sentencing Guidelines, a court is to consider all relevant conduct in determining the quantity of drugs for which a defendant is responsible. U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3. A preponderance of the evidence standard applies to the determination of drug quantity, <i>United States v. Caba,</i> 241 F.3d 98, 101 (1st Cir.2001), and a sentencing court's drug quantity determination is a factual matter that will not be disturbed on appeal unless it is clearly erroneous. <i>United States v. Innamorati,</i> 996 F.2d 456, 489 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A defendant may be held \"responsible for drug quantities which [he himself] sold, transported or negotiated\" as part of a conspiracy. <i>United States v. Miranda-Santiago,</i> 96 F.3d 517, 524 (1st Cir.1996). In addition, a defendant is accountable for \"reasonably foreseeable quantities of contraband.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3, cmt. n. 2. In this case, the sentencing court found May responsible for a kilogram of cocaine not because May had any \"reason to foresee the cocaine was going to turn up\" but rather because he was \"effectively in joint possession, constructive possession of that cocaine.\" The court remarked on May's failure to act after receiving the cocaine, stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You could have left right then. You could have turned it in. You didn't do any of that. Instead, you stayed. You went with it and were there to see it broken up and ultimately, went into the distribution channels. And you were effectively in joint possession, constructive possession of the cocaine at the time, and you are responsible for it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's conclusion regarding May's joint and constructive possession of the cocaine is well-supported by the record. According to May's own statement at his sentencing hearing, he was present when Woodward and Case divided the kilogram of cocaine into smaller amounts for further distribution. Further, May personally distributed cocaine to Case and Woodward, and had seven ounces in his own possession for a period of time. <i>See United States v. Georgacarakos,</i> 988 F.2d 1289, 1296 (1st Cir.1993) (\"Constructive possession exists if the defendant knows the drugs are available and has the power and intent to exercise dominion and control over them.\"); <i>see also United States v. Batista-Polanco,</i> 927 F.2d 14, 18-19 (1st Cir.1991) (defendant sitting at table with others while heroin was being packaged was in joint constructive possession of drug). Certainly, by personally transferring control of the cocaine to others and by having an amount of the drug in his own possession however briefly, May was \"directly involved\" with the drug, which suffices to hold him accountable for the contraband. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3, cmt. n.2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the delivery of the kilogram of cocaine alone would have sufficed to render the cocaine relevant conduct to May. <i>See United States v. Young,</i> 78 F.3d 758, 763 n. 5 (1st Cir.1996) (transactions involving different drugs but same conspirators and a common scheme made both drugs relevant conduct). May, Barbour, Woodward, and Case were all members of the same criminal enterprise that had been distributing marijuana for almost four years. The same people and process were used for the cocaine as for the marijuana, again reinforcing the district court's decision to attribute the cocaine to May. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3, cmt. n.9(A); <i>United States v. Wood,</i> 924 F.2d 399, 404 (1st Cir.1991) (taking into account conduct that involved the same mode of distribution and transaction type as the charged drug offense).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of May's direct involvement with the handling of the kilogram of cocaine and the use of the marijuana distribution system for the cocaine, we find that the district court's inclusion of the cocaine in the drug quantity was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Deadly Weapon Enhancement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">May challenges the two-level enhancement for the presence of a gun, arguing that the district court erroneously held that it is foreseeable that guns will always be involved in the collection of drug debts. Where only a guideline's application to the facts of a case is at issue, we review for clear error. <i>United States v. Jackson,</i> 3 F.3d 506, 509 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A two-level increase in offense level is mandated \"[i]f a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed\" in the course of a drug offense. U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1). The enhancement applies \"if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\" <i>Id.,</i> cmt. n.3. In a conspiracy case, the government must first show that one of the defendant's co-conspirators \"possessed a weapon during the offense.\" <i>United States v. Nelson-Rodriguez,</i> 319 F.3d 12, 59 (1st Cir.2003). Once the government demonstrates the possession of a gun, the burden is on the defendant to show that the connection between the gun and the drug crime was \"clearly improbable.\" <i>See Jackson,</i> 3 F.3d at 509.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the government demonstrated a gun was used in the course of the conspiracy. May went to Texas to help Barbour collect a marijuana debt. One of May's co-conspirators brought a .38 caliber pistol along when they went to collect the debt; May's testimony at Barbour's trial indicated he knew his co-conspirator had the gun. May presented no evidence to show the improbability of the connection between the gun and the conspiracy. Given May's failure to show that the gun was likely not connected to the conspiracy, we cannot say that the district court erred in applying the deadly weapon enhancement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Role in the Offense</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">May also challenges the application of the four-level enhancement for being an \"organizer or leader of criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1. Application of this enhancement is reviewable only for clear error. <i>United States v. Olivier-Diaz,</i> 13 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1993). We have noted before that \"battles over a defendant's status... will almost always be won or lost in the district court\" because \"the assessment of the appellant's role in the offense of conviction is factbound.\" <i>United States v. Conley,</i> 156 F.3d 78, 85 (1st Cir.1998) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">May concedes that he was a \"key player\" and a \"manager\" but argues that he had a middleman role which should result in a three-level managerial enhancement as opposed to a four-level enhancement for a leadership role. Among the relevant factors in determining the role of a defendant are:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1, cmt. n.4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record here provides ample support for the finding that May was a leader or organizer of the marijuana conspiracy. The conspiracy which May and Barbour instigated in 1996 involved at least seventeen participants. According to the presentence report and by May's own admission, May's role in the conspiracy included recruiting participants to the conspiracy as well as strawmen in Maine to be used for delivery of the marijuana from Texas. May collected the marijuana from the delivery sites, took it to others, received payment, and divided the proceeds among the participants. He was personally involved in the collection of drug debts, and typically kept for himself a larger share of the proceeds than anyone except Barbour. When Barbour was arrested in 2000, it was May who took over the business with Massey. The evidence at Barbour's trial showed that a co-conspirator identified May as the person in charge of the Maine end of the operation and used the present tense in giving that description. <i>Cf. Olivier-Diaz,</i> 13 F.3d at 5 (finding sufficient support for determination that defendant was a leader or organizer where, among other things, he recruited others to distribute the drugs, \"supervised the collection of debts,\" and oversaw the operations when two of his co-conspirators were in prison).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this evidence, the trial court's conclusion that May had a leadership role, rather than a managerial one, cannot be said to be clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Criminal History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">May's final argument is that his criminal history score was improperly calculated because the district court erroneously took into account three convictions for misdemeanors. He renews the argument made at his sentencing hearing that the three misdemeanors are sufficiently similar to the crime of disorderly conduct to merit exclusion from the criminal history calculation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A sentencing court should consider felonies, misdemeanors, and petty offenses for criminal history purposes <i>unless</i> the misdemeanor or petty offense falls within one of the exceptions provided by the guidelines. U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2. One exception provides that a conviction for disorderly conduct or a \"similar\" offense is \"counted only if (a) the sentence was a term of probation of at least one year or a term of imprisonment of at least thirty days, or (B) the prior offense was similar to an instant offense.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2(c)(1). The application of a guideline to the facts is reviewable for clear error. <i>See United States v. Camilo,</i> 71 F.3d 984, 986 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">May contends that his 1989 conviction for terrorizing is sufficiently similar to disorderly conduct to be excluded from his criminal history. In that instance, May received a sixty day suspended sentence and one year of probation. Under the terms of &#167; 4A1.2(c)(1)(A), even if the crime was similar to disorderly conduct or any other enumerated crime, it would count towards criminal history where \"the sentence was a term of probation of at least one year.\" <i>See also United States v. Gray,</i> 177 F.3d 86, 89 n. 1 (1st Cir.1999). Thus, the terrorizing misdemeanor was properly considered toward his criminal history.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, May argues his prior assault conviction was also sufficiently similar to the crime of disorderly conduct to qualify for exclusion. Relying on <i>United States v. Unger,</i> 915 F.2d 759 (1st Cir. 1990), May argues that the court erred in considering the conduct involved in the assault. He posits that the elements of the crime are sufficiently similar to those of the crime of disorderly conduct, as defined by the Model Penal Code, to justify exclusion of the misdemeanor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">May's argument is flawed. May misconstrues <i>Unger,</i> which dictates that courts consider not just the statutory elements of an offense as compared to those of an exception, but also \"the substance of the underlying state offense in order to determine whether it falls within the proscription\" of &#167; 4A1.2(c)(1)(A). 915 F.2d at 763; <i>see also United States v. Spaulding,</i> 339 F.3d 20, 22 n.1 (1st Cir.2003) (applying <i>Unger,</i> which was about U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2(c)(2), to cases involving U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2(c)(1)). Thus, the district court did not err in observing that he \"knocked somebody down and kicked them\" and using the behavior to distinguish the assault from disorderly conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assault is not one of the offenses enumerated in &#167; 4A1.2 (c)(1)(A), but we evaluate the similarity between it and the listed offense of disorderly conduct. The statutory elements and the punishment provided for each offense are among the factors that deserve comparison in the assessment of similarity. <i>See United States v. Reyes-Maya,</i> 305 F.3d 362, 366 (5th Cir.2002). The two crimes, as defined by Maine law, are clearly different. The assault statute requires physical injury or contact<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> whereas the disorderly conduct statute is simply aimed at \"annoyance.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Further, the maximum punishment for assault is twice that for disorderly conduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Thus, trying to draw a comparison between the two crimes is futile.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similar reasoning applies to the third misdemeanor conviction. First, as described above, the court correctly considered the conduct involved, which here included throwing beer bottles at a moving vehicle and continued damage even after the vehicle stopped. The court distinguished the conduct at issue from that contemplated in disorderly conduct, saying:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">if indeed you'd been throwing those bottles at a wall where they just broke harmlessly, that might have been disorderly conduct, but you were throwing them at a moving vehicle. And when it stopped, you jumped on and continued to damage it. That distinguishes it from the disorderly conduct ....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, a comparison of the statutes confirms the inclusion of the misdemeanor in the criminal history. Criminal mischief is defined as the intentional, knowing, or reckless damage or destruction of another's property without a right to do so. Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &#167; 806 (2003). The misdemeanor is punishable by up to one year in prison. <i>See id.;</i> Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &#167; 1252(1)(D). As discussed above, disorderly conduct involves but does not require destruction and is punishable by up to six months in prison. Me. Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &#167; 501; Me.Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &#167; 1252(1)(E). We hold May's criminal mischief constituted an offense that differed sufficiently from that of disorderly conduct to support its inclusion in the criminal history computation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court calculated the criminal history category properly by including all three misdemeanors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court's judgment is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> At the sentencing hearing, the district court heard the testimony of defense counsel, the government, and May. In addition, the district court judge could take into account the testimony from the Barbour trial, over which he presided and of which a transcript was submitted as evidence at the sentencing hearing. Along with the presentence report, these are all appropriate sources of facts at sentencing<i>Cf. United States v. Garafano,</i> 36 F.3d 133, 135 (1st Cir.1994) (\"Normally the trial court makes its own assessment of the facts that pertain to sentencing, drawing on trial evidence, the presentence report, any evidence offered at the hearing, and other appropriate sources.\"); <i>see also United States v. Sklar,</i> 920 F.2d 107, 110 (1st Cir.1990) (indicating rules of evidence do not apply at sentencing and that the court may consider \"virtually any dependable information\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The government had argued for attribution of an additional forty-two ounces of cocaine, but the district court made no finding about that quantity since it would not change the offense level under the guidelines</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The district court determined that May had been \"effectively in joint possession, constructive possession of [the kilogram of] cocaine at the time,\" and accordingly held him responsible for it. The district court went on to say, \"you did not distance yourself enough from it, although I understand emotionally in your mind, you think you did, you did not take part in it. But so far as the law is concerned, you are responsible for that.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Only the first issue was briefed by counsel and addressed at oral arguments, but May raised the others in his pro se brief. May's additional argument regarding the existence of two separate conspiracies fails because this Court presumes conspiracies exist absent an affirmative showing of their termination<i>United States v. Elwell,</i> 984 F.2d 1289, 1293 (1st Cir.1993). The argument that the inclusion of the cocaine constituted an amendment of the indictment is similarly doomed. <i>Cf. United States v. Reyes,</i> 3 F.3d 29 (1st Cir.1993) (upholding inclusion as relevant conduct of drug transactions that were initially charged but dropped).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> May argues that the fact that the conspiracy stopped during part of Barbour's time in prison is evidence that it was Barbour and not May who led the drug ring. First of all, the presentence report indicates that, while the conspiracy slowed during Barbour's initial time in custody, it did continue. After a temporary hiatus in July 1998, May and Massey continued the distribution during another of Barbour's stints in prison in 2000. More than one person can have a leadership role in a conspiracy<i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1, cmt. n.4 (\"There can, of course, be more than one person who qualifies as a leader or organizer of a criminal association or conspiracy.\"); <i>see also United States v. Andujar,</i> 49 F.3d 16, 25 (1st Cir.1995) (affirming determination that defendant was a leader in spite of the fact that someone else was \"running the show\" because the defendant was the ultimate organizer's \"personal contact, or principal man, ... and in that sense he was the leader, a leader and organizer\").

May was charged with two conspiracy counts: involvement in a conspiracy to distribute cocaine and involvement in a conspiracy to distribute marijuana. May pled guilty to the marijuana count and as part of his plea agreement the cocaine count was dismissed. Now May appeals, arguing that the district court erroneously augmented his sentence when it found (1) a kilogram of cocaine attributable to May, (2) his co-conspirator used a dangerous weapon, (3) May had a leadership role in the offense, and (4) three misdemeanor convictions should be included as part of May's criminal history. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">May and Scott Barbour began to obtain and distribute marijuana in Texas, Florida, and Maine in 1996. Over time, others joined in the marijuana distribution, with May heading the operation in Maine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Typically, Barbour and others purchased marijuana in Texas and shipped it to May and others for distribution in Maine. May retained his share of the proceeds and forwarded the appropriate share to Barbour and others in Texas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 2000, May aided Barbour in the collection of $10,000 in drug debts. At Barbour's trial, May testified that he went to Texas to collect a debt owed by two men for some marijuana they had \"strong armed\" from Barbour. May, co-conspirator Shane Hall, and Barbour got drunk and went to Hall's house, where Hall obtained a .38 caliber pistol; the three then went looking for the debtors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 2000, Barbour sent May a package containing one kilogram of cocaine. No cocaine had previously been involved in the marijuana distribution conspiracy, and Barbour had not told May that cocaine was being sent on this occasion. According to May, the receipt of the cocaine was unexpected and unwanted; May had been treated in 1989-90 for cocaine addiction, and knew proximity to the drug posed a danger of relapse. When he realized Barbour had sent him cocaine, not marijuana, he communicated his anger to Barbour in Texas and to two other conspirators in Maine, Steven Case and Kevin Woodward. He told the three men that he wanted nothing to do with cocaine and that he was withdrawing from the marijuana conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The kilogram of cocaine was divided into smaller quantities, and May gave seventeen ounces to Case, ten to Woodward, and retained seven ounces for himself. May established terms of payment for the cocaine. Fearing access to cocaine would cause him to return to his former drug habit, May later gave his seven ounces to Woodward.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">May denied having anything to do with distributing the cocaine after its receipt and division. He also denied both paying for the cocaine and accepting payment for Barbour.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In spite of his statements to his co-conspirators, May did not immediately withdraw from the marijuana conspiracy. He continued to receive and distribute marijuana (but not cocaine) from Texas, primarily from one Todd Massey. As part of the ongoing conspiracy, there was a further shipment to Maine of forty-two ounces of cocaine, but this went directly to Case without May's knowledge or participation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 16, 2001, a federal grand jury indicted May and Barbour on two counts of conspiracy. Count One alleged that between January 1, 1999 and October 1, 2001, May and Barbour conspired to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute at least 500 grams of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1) and 846 (\"the cocaine count\"). Count Two alleged that during the same time period May and Barbour conspired to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute more than fifty kilograms of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(C), and 846 (\"the marijuana count\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 2, 2002, May pled guilty to the marijuana count. The plea agreement provided that the maximum statutory sentence was twenty years' imprisonment under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(C). The government agreed to move to dismiss the cocaine count after sentencing on the marijuana count. The plea agreement did not contain stipulations for sentencing guidelines calculations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to sentencing, the parties stipulated that the quantity of marijuana attributable to May as relevant offense conduct was between 700 and 1,000 kilograms, corresponding to an offense level of thirty. The parties disagreed as to whether any cocaine should be counted as relevant offense conduct, whether there should be a deadly weapon enhancement, and whether three misdemeanors should be included in the criminal history calculation. These questions were submitted to the district court for determination at the sentencing hearing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court accepted the stipulation of the parties regarding marijuana quantity, and attributed one kilogram of cocaine to May as relevant offense conduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> This attribution resulted in raising the base offense level from level thirty to level thirty-two. The district court imposed upward adjustments of four levels for role in the offense and two levels for possession of a firearm, and a downward adjustment of three levels for acceptance of responsibility, resulting in an adjusted offense level of thirty-five. May's criminal history category was determined to be Category III, based on the inclusion of, among other past offenses, convictions for the misdemeanors of terrorizing, assault, and criminal mischief. Offense level thirty-five and criminal history Category III combined to produce a guidelines range of 210-262 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon the government's &#167; 5K1.1 motion for downward departure, the district court departed downward and sentenced May to 174 months' imprisonment, to be followed by three years of supervised release. May now appeals the sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Analysis</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">May argues the sentencing court erred in several respects. First, May argues that the drug quantity determination was erroneous because the kilogram of cocaine should not have been attributed to him as relevant offense conduct. Second, May questions the enhancement for a co-conspirator's possession of a deadly weapon, claiming that such possession is not always reasonably foreseeable during an attempt to collect a drug-related debt. Third, May posits that the district court erred in finding May to be a leader or organizer. Finally, May believes the district court erred in including three misdemeanors as part of his criminal history. We address each argument in turn.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Drug Quantity</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the United States Sentencing Guidelines, a court is to consider all relevant conduct in determining the quantity of drugs for which a defendant is responsible. U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3. A preponderance of the evidence standard applies to the determination of drug quantity, <i>United States v. Caba,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199298\"><a href=\"/opinion/199298/united-states-v-caba/\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></a></span>, 101 (1st Cir.2001), and a sentencing court's drug quantity determination is a factual matter that will not be disturbed on appeal unless it is clearly erroneous. <i>United States v. Innamorati,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"609734\"><a href=\"/opinion/609734/united-states-v-kenneth-innamorati-united-states-v-william-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">456</span></a></span>, 489 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A defendant may be held \"responsible for drug quantities which [he himself] sold, transported or negotiated\" as part of a conspiracy. <i>United States v. Miranda-Santiago,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196984\"><a href=\"/opinion/196984/united-states-v-miranda-santiago/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">517</span></a></span>, 524 (1st Cir.1996). In addition, a defendant is accountable for \"reasonably foreseeable quantities of contraband.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3, cmt. n. 2. In this case, the sentencing court found May responsible for a kilogram of cocaine not because May had any \"reason to foresee the cocaine was going to turn up\" but rather because he was \"effectively in joint possession, constructive possession of that cocaine.\" The court remarked on May's failure to act after receiving the cocaine, stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You could have left right then. You could have turned it in. You didn't do any of that. Instead, you stayed. You went with it and were there to see it broken up and ultimately, went into the distribution channels. And you were effectively in joint possession, constructive possession of the cocaine at the time, and you are responsible for it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's conclusion regarding May's joint and constructive possession of the cocaine is well-supported by the record. According to May's own statement at his sentencing hearing, he was present when Woodward and Case divided the kilogram of cocaine into smaller amounts for further distribution. Further, May personally distributed cocaine to Case and Woodward, and had seven ounces in his own possession for a period of time. <i>See United States v. Georgacarakos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602802\"><a href=\"/opinion/602802/united-states-v-peter-n-georgacarakos/\"><span class=\"volume\">988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1289</span></a></span>, 1296 (1st Cir.1993) (\"Constructive possession exists if the defendant knows the drugs are available and has the power and intent to exercise dominion and control over them.\"); <i>see also United States v.

Certainly, by personally transferring control of the cocaine to others and by having an amount of the drug in his own possession however briefly, May was \"directly involved\" with the drug, which suffices to hold him accountable for the contraband. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3, cmt. n.2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the delivery of the kilogram of cocaine alone would have sufficed to render the cocaine relevant conduct to May. <i>See United States v.

May, Barbour, Woodward, and Case were all members of the same criminal enterprise that had been distributing marijuana for almost four years. The same people and process were used for the cocaine as for the marijuana, again reinforcing the district court's decision to attribute the cocaine to May. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3, cmt. n.9(A); <i>United States v. Wood,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555054\"><a href=\"/opinion/555054/united-states-v-darryl-wood/\"><span class=\"volume\">924</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">399</span></a></span>, 404 (1st Cir.1991) (taking into account conduct that involved the same mode of distribution and transaction type as the charged drug offense).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of May's direct involvement with the handling of the kilogram of cocaine and the use of the marijuana distribution system for the cocaine, we find that the district court's inclusion of the cocaine in the drug quantity was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Deadly Weapon Enhancement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">May challenges the two-level enhancement for the presence of a gun, arguing that the district court erroneously held that it is foreseeable that guns will always be involved in the collection of drug debts. Where only a guideline's application to the facts of a case is at issue, we review for clear error. <i>United States v.

U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1). The enhancement applies \"if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\" <i>Id.,</i> cmt. n.3. In a conspiracy case, the government must first show that one of the defendant's co-conspirators \"possessed a weapon during the offense.\" <i>United States v.

Once the government demonstrates the possession of a gun, the burden is on the defendant to show that the connection between the gun and the drug crime was \"clearly improbable.\" <i>See Jackson,</i> 3 F.3d at 509.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the government demonstrated a gun was used in the course of the conspiracy. May went to Texas to help Barbour collect a marijuana debt. One of May's co-conspirators brought a .38 caliber pistol along when they went to collect the debt; May's testimony at Barbour's trial indicated he knew his co-conspirator had the gun. May presented no evidence to show the improbability of the connection between the gun and the conspiracy. Given May's failure to show that the gun was likely not connected to the conspiracy, we cannot say that the district court erred in applying the deadly weapon enhancement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Role in the Offense</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">May also challenges the application of the four-level enhancement for being an \"organizer or leader of criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1. Application of this enhancement is reviewable only for clear error. <i>United States v. Olivier-Diaz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195103\"><a href=\"/opinion/195103/united-states-v-olivier/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.1993). We have noted before that \"battles over a defendant's status... will almost always be won or lost in the district court\" because \"the assessment of the appellant's role in the offense of conviction is factbound.\" <i>United States v. Conley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198112\"><a href=\"/opinion/198112/united-states-v-conley/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span>, 85 (1st Cir.1998) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">May concedes that he was a \"key player\" and a \"manager\" but argues that he had a middleman role which should result in a three-level managerial enhancement as opposed to a four-level enhancement for a leadership role. Among the relevant factors in determining the role of a defendant are:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1, cmt. n.4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record here provides ample support for the finding that May was a leader or organizer of the marijuana conspiracy. The conspiracy which May and Barbour instigated in 1996 involved at least seventeen participants. According to the presentence report and by May's own admission, May's role in the conspiracy included recruiting participants to the conspiracy as well as strawmen in Maine to be used for delivery of the marijuana from Texas. May collected the marijuana from the delivery sites, took it to others, received payment, and divided the proceeds among the participants. He was personally involved in the collection of drug debts, and typically kept for himself a larger share of the proceeds than anyone except Barbour. When Barbour was arrested in 2000, it was May who took over the business with Massey. The evidence at Barbour's trial showed that a co-conspirator identified May as the person in charge of the Maine end of the operation and used the present tense in giving that description. <i>Cf. Olivier-Diaz,</i> 13 F.3d at 5 (finding sufficient support for determination that defendant was a leader or organizer where, among other things, he recruited others to distribute the drugs, \"supervised the collection of debts,\" and oversaw the operations when two of his co-conspirators were in prison).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this evidence, the trial court's conclusion that May had a leadership role, rather than a managerial one, cannot be said to be clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Criminal History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">May's final argument is that his criminal history score was improperly calculated because the district court erroneously took into account three convictions for misdemeanors. He renews the argument made at his sentencing hearing that the three misdemeanors are sufficiently similar to the crime of disorderly conduct to merit exclusion from the criminal history calculation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A sentencing court should consider felonies, misdemeanors, and petty offenses for criminal history purposes <i>unless</i> the misdemeanor or petty offense falls within one of the exceptions provided by the guidelines. U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2. One exception provides that a conviction for disorderly conduct or a \"similar\" offense is \"counted only if (a) the sentence was a term of probation of at least one year or a term of imprisonment of at least thirty days, or (B) the prior offense was similar to an instant offense.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2(c)(1). The application of a guideline to the facts is reviewable for clear error. <i>See United States v. Camilo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196478\"><a href=\"/opinion/196478/united-states-v-camilo/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">984</span></a></span>, 986 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">May contends that his 1989 conviction for terrorizing is sufficiently similar to disorderly conduct to be excluded from his criminal history. In that instance, May received a sixty day suspended sentence and one year of probation. Under the terms of &#167; 4A1.2(c)(1)(A), even if the crime was similar to disorderly conduct or any other enumerated crime, it would count towards criminal history where \"the sentence was a term of probation of at least one year.\" <i>See also United States v. Gray,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198495\"><a href=\"/opinion/198495/united-states-v-gray/\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span>, 89 n. 1 (1st Cir.1999). Thus, the terrorizing misdemeanor was properly considered toward his criminal history.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, May argues his prior assault conviction was also sufficiently similar to the crime of disorderly conduct to qualify for exclusion. Relying on <i>United States v. Unger,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548928\"><a href=\"/opinion/548928/united-states-v-eric-n-unger/\"><span class=\"volume\">915</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">759</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1990), May argues that the court erred in considering the conduct involved in the assault. He posits that the elements of the crime are sufficiently similar to those of the crime of disorderly conduct, as defined by the Model Penal Code, to justify exclusion of the misdemeanor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">May's argument is flawed. May misconstrues <i>Unger,</i> which dictates that courts consider not just the statutory elements of an offense as compared to those of an exception, but also \"the substance of the underlying state offense in order to determine whether it falls within the proscription\" of &#167; 4A1.2(c)(1)(A). 915 F.2d at 763; <i>see also United States v. Spaulding,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200586\"><a href=\"/opinion/200586/united-states-v-spaulding/\"><span class=\"volume\">339</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 22 n.1 (1st Cir.2003) (applying <i>Unger,</i> which was about U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2(c)(2), to cases involving U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2(c)(1)). Thus, the district court did not err in observing that he \"knocked somebody down and kicked them\" and using the behavior to distinguish the assault from disorderly conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assault is not one of the offenses enumerated in &#167; 4A1.2 (c)(1)(A), but we evaluate the similarity between it and the listed offense of disorderly conduct. The statutory elements and the punishment provided for each offense are among the factors that deserve comparison in the assessment of similarity. <i>See United States v. Reyes-Maya,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"28778\"><a href=\"/opinion/28778/united-states-v-reyes-maya/\"><span class=\"volume\">305</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">362</span></a></span>, 366 (5th Cir.2002). The two crimes, as defined by Maine law, are clearly different. The assault statute requires physical injury or contact<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> whereas the disorderly conduct statute is simply aimed at \"annoyance.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Further, the maximum punishment for assault is twice that for disorderly conduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Thus, trying to draw a comparison between the two crimes is futile.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similar reasoning applies to the third misdemeanor conviction. First, as described above, the court correctly considered the conduct involved, which here included throwing beer bottles at a moving vehicle and continued damage even after the vehicle stopped. The court distinguished the conduct at issue from that contemplated in disorderly conduct, saying:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">if indeed you'd been throwing those bottles at a wall where they just broke harmlessly, that might have been disorderly conduct, but you were throwing them at a moving vehicle. And when it stopped, you jumped on and continued to damage it. That distinguishes it from the disorderly conduct ....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, a comparison of the statutes confirms the inclusion of the misdemeanor in the criminal history. Criminal mischief is defined as the intentional, knowing, or reckless damage or destruction of another's property without a right to do so. Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &#167; 806 (2003). The misdemeanor is punishable by up to one year in prison. <i>See id.;</i> Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &#167; 1252(1)(D). As discussed above, disorderly conduct involves but does not require destruction and is punishable by up to six months in prison. Me. Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &#167; 501; Me.Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &#167; 1252(1)(E). We hold May's criminal mischief constituted an offense that differed sufficiently from that of disorderly conduct to support its inclusion in the criminal history computation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court calculated the criminal history category properly by including all three misdemeanors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court's judgment is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> At the sentencing hearing, the district court heard the testimony of defense counsel, the government, and May. In addition, the district court judge could take into account the testimony from the Barbour trial, over which he presided and of which a transcript was submitted as evidence at the sentencing hearing. Along with the presentence report, these are all appropriate sources of facts at sentencing<i>Cf. United States v. Garafano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195613\"><a href=\"/opinion/195613/united-states-v-garafano/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">133</span></a></span>, 135 (1st Cir.1994) (\"Normally the trial court makes its own assessment of the facts that pertain to sentencing, drawing on trial evidence, the presentence report, any evidence offered at the hearing, and other appropriate sources.\"); <i>see also United States v.

The district court went on to say, \"you did not distance yourself enough from it, although I understand emotionally in your mind, you think you did, you did not take part in it. But so far as the law is concerned, you are responsible for that.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Only the first issue was briefed by counsel and addressed at oral arguments, but May raised the others in his pro se brief. May's additional argument regarding the existence of two separate conspiracies fails because this Court presumes conspiracies exist absent an affirmative showing of their termination<i>United States v.

The argument that the inclusion of the cocaine constituted an amendment of the indictment is similarly doomed. <i>Cf. United States v.

First of all, the presentence report indicates that, while the conspiracy slowed during Barbour's initial time in custody, it did continue. After a temporary hiatus in July 1998, May and Massey continued the distribution during another of Barbour's stints in prison in 2000. More than one person can have a leadership role in a conspiracy<i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1, cmt. n.4 (\"There can, of course, be more than one person who qualifies as a leader or organizer of a criminal association or conspiracy.\"); <i>see also United States v.
