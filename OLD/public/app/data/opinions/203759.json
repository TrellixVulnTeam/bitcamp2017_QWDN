D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                        Lynch, Chief Judge,\n\n              Torruella and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Judith H. Mizner, Assistant Federal Public Defender, Federal\nPublic Defender's Office, for appellant.\n     Renée M. Bunker, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nPaula D. Silsby, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          April 2, 2009\n\f            BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.           The issue the parties have\n\nframed on this appeal is whether, where the district court adjusts\n\na prior sentence to account for post-sentence cooperation by the\n\ndefendant, the adjustment may reflect factors other than that\n\ncooperation.     We sustain the district court's disposition of this\n\ncase but on a narrower ground, deferring until necessary the larger\n\nissue--which may arise only rarely and implicates a difficult and\n\ndelicate issue of statutory construction.\n\n            The defendant, Jonathan Poland, was eighteen years and\n\nthree months old when he and his seventeen-year old cousin (who was\n\njust shy of his eighteenth birthday) made and detonated two pipe\n\nbombs during the Spring of 2004. Poland was indicted and convicted\n\nof unlawfully possessing an unregistered destructive device, 26\n\nU.S.C. §§ 5861(d), 5841, 5845(f), 5871 (2006), and use of an\n\nexplosive   to   maliciously   damage   or    destroy   property   used   in\n\ninterstate commerce, 18 U.S.C. § 844(i) (2006).\n\n            The explosion caused little damage but was close to a\n\ntruck stop office and fuel of various kinds and so was no minor\n\nprank.   Poland was sentenced to 63 months imprisonment, the three\n\nmonths over and above the mandatory minimum sentence of 60 months\n\nbeing added because he committed perjury during a suppression\n\nhearing.     Poland appealed, but later withdrew the appeal and\n\ncooperated with the government.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\f            The cooperation led to successful government proceedings\n\nagainst    Poland's   cousin    but,    the    matter   having     begun    with   a\n\njuvenile charge, the cousin received a sentence of only three\n\nmonths.    After Poland cooperated, the government moved to reduce\n\nPoland's sentence to 48 months.         Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(b)(1).          Poland\n\nsought a sentence below 48 months, arguing that all of the ordinary\n\nstatutory factors could be considered afresh, see 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3553(a),    and   stressing    the     much   longer    sentence    he     received\n\ncompared to his cousin.\n\n            At a hearing on the motion, the district judge asked the\n\nparties to address the impact of new language in Rule 35(b).                 Under\n\nprecedents    construing      former    versions,      sentencing    courts    may\n\nconsider only the extent of the cooperation given in calculating\n\nthe reduced sentence.          The district court noted that both the\n\nrule's new language and an advisory committee note suggested that\n\non re-sentencing any of the factors identified in 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3553(a) could now be considered.              The pertinent language of the\n\nrespective changes appears below.\n\n            In the end, the district court held that to so read the\n\nnew rule would work a substantive change and violate the Rules\n\nEnabling Act,     28 U.S.C. § 2072(a).         United States v. Poland, 533\n\nF. Supp. 2d 199, 210 (D. Me. 2008).              To avoid this outcome, the\n\ndistrict court followed precedent under the old rule and held that\n\n\"the new Rule 35(b) . . . limit[s] the judge, as before the\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\famendment, to consider only substantial assistance factors in\n\nsupport of the amount of a reduction, notwithstanding the amendment\n\nand the Advisory Committee Note.\"    Id. at 211.\n\n          The government's recommendation did not bind the district\n\ncourt, which concluded that a reduction to 40 months properly\n\naccounted for the cooperation provided by Poland.     However, the\n\ncourt said that were it free to consider factors other than\n\ncooperation--in particular \"the need to avoid unwarranted sentence\n\ndisparities among defendants with similar records who have been\n\nfound guilty of similar conduct,\" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6)--it would\n\nreduce Poland's sentence to 30 months.    Id. at 213-14.\n\n          Poland now appeals, arguing that under the current Rule\n\n35(b), the judge was free once the motion was made to consider\n\nfactors other than cooperation in reducing the sentence.   We have\n\njurisdiction over the appeal, 28 U.S.C. § 1291; United States v.\n\nMcAndrews, 12 F.3d 273, 277-78 (1st Cir. 1993); and, as the issue\n\nis whether the district court misinterpreted governing law, review\n\nis de novo and our authority to provide it is clear despite a\n\ncircuit split that might matter if the issue were not purely\n\nlegal.1\n\n\n     1\n      Other circuits, disagreeing with McAndrews, regard the\nappealability of a Rule 35(b) decision as limited by 18 U.S.C. §\n3742, e.g., United States v. Haskins, 479 F.3d 955, 957 (8th Cir.\n2007) (per curiam), but even if that limitation applied, the claim\nhere would be reviewable because--if the district court were\nmistaken--the sentence would reflect a mistake of law and so be\n\"imposed in violation of law\" under section 3742(a)(1).\n\n                               -4-\n\f              The merits of the legal issue, to which we now turn,\n\nrequire a precise understanding of how Rule 35(b) evolved.         Before\n\nthe sentencing guidelines, Rule 35(b) permitted a sentencing judge\n\nto reduce a sentence, more or less without condition, within 120\n\ndays of the sentence or disposition of any appeal.       This open ended\n\napproach was substantially altered by the Sentencing Reform Act of\n\n1984, Pub. L. No. 98-473, Title II, 98 Stat. 1987 (\"the Reform\n\nAct\"), which adopted a framework for sentencing guidelines that\n\naimed    at    restricting   the   discretion   of   judges   in   initial\n\nsentencing.\n\n              Consonantly, the Reform Act limited the judge's authority\n\nto alter a final sentence, confining it to three categories, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3582(c), of which only one directly concerns us.              It\n\nreads:\n\n              The   court  may  not   modify  a   term  of\n              imprisonment once it has been imposed except\n              that--\n\n              (1) in any case--\n              ....\n\n              (B) the court may modify     an imposed term of\n              imprisonment to the extent   otherwise expressly\n              permitted by statute or      by Rule 35 of the\n              Federal Rules of Criminal    Procedure . . . .\n\nThe Reform Act also rewrote Rule 35(b) to provide:\n\n              The court, on motion of the Government, may\n              within one year after the imposition of a\n              sentence, lower a sentence to reflect a\n              defendant's subsequent, substantial assistance\n              in the investigation or prosecution of another\n              person who has committed an offense, in\n\n                                    -5-\n\f           accordance with the guidelines and policy\n           statements issued by the Sentencing Commission\n           . . . .\n\nReform Act of 1984, § 212(b)(emphasis added).\n\n           Before the Reform Act became effective in 1987, Congress\n\nagain added provisions to both 18 U.S.C. and to Rule 35, which\n\nfurnished the district court authority, in both initial sentencing\n\nand re-sentencing, to impose sentences below prescribed statutory\n\nminimums based on a government substantial assistance motion, Anti-\n\nDrug Abuse Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-570, Title I, §§ 1007, 1009,\n\n100 Stat. 3207-08 (1986); but we defer discussion of those changes.\n\n           Given the underscored language of Rule 35(b) as amended\n\nby the 1984 Reform Act--\"to reflect a defendant's subsequent,\n\nsubstantial   assistance\"--other     circuit    courts    (unsurprisingly)\n\nconcluded that only the defendant's substantial assistance could be\n\nconsidered in granting or measuring a Rule 35(b) reduction.           E.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Chavarria-Herrara, 15 F.3d 1033, 1037 (11th Cir.\n\n1994).     This circuit (and other circuits) similarly construed\n\nparallel language in the statute that permits a sentence below a\n\nstatutory minimum to reflect substantial assistance. E.g., United\n\nStates v. Ahlers, 305 F.3d 54, 60 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n           In 2002, in re-drafting the rules to improve clarity, the\n\nadvisory committee proposed a \"stylistic\" change to Rule 35(b),\n\nexcising   the   language   that   required    that   a   reduced   sentence\n\n\"reflect\" a defendant's substantial assistance.           Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\f35 advisory committee's note, 2002 amendments.        Instead, the 2002\n\ntext provided only that \"reducing the sentence accord[] with the\n\nSentencing Commission's guidelines and policy statements.\"2\n\n          In fact, neither before nor after has the Commission\n\nadopted guidelines or policy statements directed to post-sentence\n\nreductions based on substantial assistance.       There has been from\n\nthe outset a general guideline provision, not using \"reflect\"\n\nlanguage, for guideline departures based on substantial assistance,\n\nseemingly directed to original sentencing. U.S.S.G. § 5K1.1. This\n\ncircuit, and other courts, read this guideline as implicitly\n\nincorporating such a requirement.       United States v. Chestna, 962\n\nF.2d 103, 106-07 (1st Cir.), cert. denied 506 U.S. 920 (1992).\n\n          Despite the 2002 elision, the few circuits to address the\n\nissue continued to read Rule 35(b) as limiting post-sentence\n\nreductions to assistance-related factors.      E.g., United States v.\n\nDobson, No. 07-15732, 2008 WL 4962927 at *2-3 (11th Cir. Nov. 21,\n\n2008) (unpublished); United States v. Lindsay, 254 F. App'x. 168,\n\n169-70 (4th Cir. 2007) (unpublished), cert. denied 128 S.Ct. 1688\n\n(2008).   Precedent   is   limited   because   many   circuits   limit   a\n\ndefendant's ability to appeal decisions on Rule 35(b) motions.\n\nE.g., Haskins, 479 F.3d at 957.\n\n\n     2\n      Since 1984, a number changes have been made to Rule 35(b);\nfor example, the rule was altered in 2004 to allow consideration fo\nassistance provided after one year after sentencing but only under\nstated conditions. Our discussion of rule changes is limited to\nthose material to the present case.\n\n                                  -7-\n\f              The next step in the chronology was the Supreme Court's\n\n2005 decision in United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005),\n\nmaking the guidelines advisory rather than mandatory to save them\n\nfrom constitutional invalidity.        Thereafter, apparently believing\n\nthat       Booker   required   this   change,   the   advisory   committee\n\nrecommended deletion of Rule 35(b)'s then existing requirement that\n\na sentence reduction \"accord[] with the Sentencing Commission's\n\nGuidelines and policy statements,\"3 and the deletion was adopted\n\nthrough the rules process effective December 1, 2007.\n\n              Rule 35(b) now reads in relevant part, and so read when\n\nthe district court considered the government motion in this case,\n\nas follows:\n\n              Upon the government's motion made within one\n              year of sentencing, the court may reduce a\n              sentence if the defendant, after sentencing,\n              provided    substantial     assistance     in\n              investigating or prosecuting another person.\n\nIf this language alone were considered, Poland might well plausibly\n\nargue that a re-sentencing court could, in granting a substantial\n\nassistance motion, consider other factors and not just substantial\n\nassistance in setting the new sentence.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      Memorandum from Booker Subcomm. to Advisory Comm. on Criminal\nRules,      4     (Mar.      15,     2005),      available       at\nhttp://www.uscourts.gov/rules/Agenda_Books.htm#criminal. This view\nwas contrary to that of the Sentencing Commission staff. Letter\nfrom Judith W. Sheon, Staff Director, Sentencing Commission, to the\nStanding    Committee     (Feb.    15,    2006),    available    at\nhttp://www.uscourts.gov/rules/CRRules2005.htm.\n\n                                      -8-\n\f           This is so even though the language changes that produced\n\nthe present rule resulted from two apparent mistakes. The first is\n\nthe   advisory   committee's   belief     that    deleting   the    limiting\n\n\"reflect\" language from Rule 35(b) in 2002 was mere clarification;\n\nthe second is its view that Booker compelled it to delete in 2007\n\nthe remaining reference to the guidelines.           The former error is\n\npatent,   although   temporarily    masked   by   the   reference    to   the\n\nguidelines, and stands as caution to restyling projects.\n\n           As for the second change, the revisors' view (although\n\nshared by the Ninth Circuit, United States v. Hicks, 472 F.3d 1167\n\n(9th Cir. 2007)), quite probably misreads Booker.            The jury trial\n\nconcerns that led to invalidating mandatory guidelines for initial\n\nsentencing do not bear equally on every regulation of sentencing.\n\nBooker's Sixth Amendment rationale built on a tension with jury\n\ntrial values insofar as the guidelines mandated an increased\n\npenalty because of additional conduct (e.g., using a gun, harming\n\na victim) found only by the judge rather than the jury.\n\n           Neither the language of Booker nor its rationale appears\n\nto constrain Congress' power to delimit, whether by guideline or\n\notherwise, the conditions on which judges may reduce sentences once\n\nimposed; Congress can surely decide whether and when any reductions\n\nare allowed and surely as well who should make the downward\n\nadjustment and on what basis.       Cf.   United States v. Fanfan, No.\n\n08-2062, 2009 WL 531281, at        *4, ___ F.3d ___ (1st Cir. Mar. 4,\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\f2009) (constraining downward adjustment under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)\n\nbased on revision of crack cocaine guideline).\n\n           But despite faulty premises, the 2002 and 2007 changes in\n\nRule 35(b) were adopted through the rulemaking process, and laws\n\nbased on mistaken premises, whether legal or factual, are not\n\nuncommon and are commonly given effect.           Cf. Pernell v. Southall\n\nRealty, 416 U.S. 363 (1974). So such rule changes arguably control\n\nunless barred by the Rules Enabling Act, which famously authorizes\n\n\"procedural\" rules and provides that \"[s]uch rules shall not\n\nabridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right.\"              28 U.S.C. §\n\n2072(b).\n\n           The district court said that stripping out Congress'\n\n\"reflect\" language from Rule 35(b) and the limiting reference to\n\nthe guidelines would comprise such a \"substantive\" change barred by\n\nthe Rules Enabling Act; thus, the judge read back into the rule the\n\n\"requirement   that    the   reduction        'reflect'   the   'subsequent\n\nsubstantial assistance.'\"     Poland, 533 F. Supp. 2d at 211.         This,\n\nthe judge said, brought back into play earlier case law almost\n\nuniformly reading such language to exclude non-assistance factors\n\nin determining such a reduction.\n\n           The Rules Enabling Act's key language is opaque and its\n\nfew   constructions   have   occurred    in    quite   different   contexts.\n\nBurlington N. R.R. Co. v. Woods, 480 U.S. 1 (1987); Sibbach v.\n\nWilson, 312 U.S. 1 (1941).     Among other difficulties, the statute\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fbrings into play both an enduring conundrum--the line between\n\nsubstance and procedure--and the puzzle of the statute's reference\n\nto \"rights.\"4     The rules process is among the most important\n\nendeavors in the judiciary; any constraining construction of the\n\nstatute could have far reaching implications.\n\n            The sentencing question in our case arises out of a fact\n\npattern that may not be common: usually the only new fact on a Rule\n\n35(b) motion will be the substantial assistance furnished since\n\nother factors will have already been fully considered; it is the\n\npeculiarity here of the belated sentence for Poland's cousin that\n\ncreated a second argument for a reduction after the original\n\nsentence.    So we choose to affirm the district court's outcome on\n\na narrower ground and defer for now any encounter with the Rules\n\nEnabling Act.\n\n             Poland's   reduced   sentence   was   below   the   statutory\n\nminimum of sixty months.    18 U.S.C. § 844(i).     Had the substantial\n\nassistance reduction Poland received occurred at the time of his\n\ninitial sentencing, it would have been governed by 18 U.S.C. §\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      Examples of the vast literature on the topic are Steven B.\nBurbank, The Rules Enabling Act of 1934, 130 U. Pa L. Rev. 1015\n(1982); John Hart Ely, The Irrepressible Myth of Erie, 87 Harv. L.\nRev. 693 (1974); Leslie M. Kelleher, Taking \"Substantive Rights\"\n(in the Rules Enabling Act) More Seriously, 74 Notre Dame L. Rev.\n47 (1998); Martin H. Redish & Dennis Murashko, The Rules Enabling\nAct and the Procedural-Substantive Tension: A Lesson in Statutory\nInterpretation, 93 Minn. L. Rev. 26 (2008).\n\n                                  -11-\n\f3553(e), which was added to the Reform Act by the previously cited\n\nAnti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986; the provision states (emphasis added):\n\n           Upon motion of the Government, the court shall\n           have the authority to impose a sentence below\n           a level established by statute as a minimum\n           sentence so as to reflect a defendant's\n           substantial assistance in the investigation or\n           prosecution   of   another  person   who   has\n           committed an offense. Such sentence shall be\n           imposed in accordance with the guidelines and\n           policy statements issued by the Sentencing\n           Commission pursuant to section 994 of title\n           28, United States Code.\n\n           Rule 35(b) similarly provides, in language also added in\n\n1986 by the same statute and now in subsection (4), that on the\n\ngovernment's motion based on substantial assistance, \"the court may\n\nreduce   the   sentence   to    a   level   below   the   minimum   sentence\n\nestablished    by   statute.\"       Traditionally,    the   reductions   for\n\nsubstantial assistance below the statutory minimum--whether at\n\ninitial sentencing or on sentence reduction--have been governed by\n\nthe same standards, see, e.g., United States v. Doe, 940 F.2d 199,\n\n203 n.7 (7th Cir.), cert. denied 502 U.S. 869 (1992), as Congress\n\ndoubtless intended.\n\n           Courts would surely have reached this result in re-\n\nsentencing cases, even if Congress had not echoed the \"reflects\"\n\nlanguage in the Reform Act's version of Rule 35(b).                 Had that\n\nphrase been omitted, the courts would still have construed the two\n\nenactments in para materia, there being no obvious reason why\n\nCongress would want the reflects limitation to apply in one context\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fbut not in the other.    Cf. In re Sealed Case No. 97-3112, 181 F.3d\n\n128, 133 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (noting Rule 35(b), § 3553(e), and §\n\n5K1.1 are to be read \"in pari materia\").       For mandatory minimums,\n\nbut perhaps only for mandatory minimums, the 2002 deletion of the\n\n\"reflects\" language in the rule may be merely \"stylistic.\"\n\n           To put the matter differently, we hold that for re-\n\nsentence adjustments that go below the statutory mandatory minimum,\n\nRule 35(b) must be read in conformity with 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e).\n\nCongress has never changed the statutory rule that such reductions\n\nmust reflect only the assistance provided.       Nor is there anything\n\nin the \"legislative history\" of changes to Rule 35(b) that reflects\n\nany desire to create a discrepancy for post-sentence adjustments\n\nbelow the mandatory minimum.\n\n           Poland's    statutory   mandatory   minimum   sentence   is   60\n\nmonths.   The district court was entitled to reduce the sentence to\n\nreflect the assistance provided, which it calculated to justify a\n\nsentence of 40 months.       It could not, as we read Rule 35(b),\n\nprovide a greater reduction below the mandatory minimum for any\n\nother reason.   This disposes of Poland's reliance on comparability\n\nwith his cousin, any alternative interpretation of U.S.S.G. § 5K1.1\n\nor otherwise pertinent sentencing factors prescribed by Congress.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n                       -Concurring Opinion Follows-\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\f           TORRUELLA,   Circuit     Judge    (Concurring).     I     join   the\n\nresult, but write separately to express my views on our current\n\nsentencing regime as it affected this case.\n\n           As set forth below, all of the parties, including the\n\ndistrict   court,   agreed   that   the     sentencing   disparity    between\n\nPoland's sentence and his cousin's juvenile sentence supported a\n\nsentencing reduction to lessen that disparity.           The plain text of\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b), after amendments made to\n\nit in 2002 and 2007, permitted such a reduction.           The parties and\n\nthe district court, however, got caught up in the minutiae of\n\nwhether those amendments, the latter inspired by Booker, allowed\n\nthe district court to provide such a reduction.           Although I agree\n\nwith the ultimate result given the existing state of the law, and\n\nthus join the majority's affirmance, I find the events that led to\n\nthat result troubling.\n\n           In order to understand my concerns, I will provide some\n\nbackground that was not essential to the majority opinion but is\n\nrelevant here.      After Poland cooperated, the government filed a\n\nmotion to reduce Poland's sentence under Rule 35(b), recommending\n\na 48-month sentence.    Poland filed a responsive memorandum, urging\n\nthe district court to look beyond the factors outlined in U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 5k1.1 and consider all factors under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).            Poland\n\nspecifically asked the court to consider the disparity between\n\nPoland's sentence (63 months) and his cousin's (3 months).\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\f             A       hearing   on   the   government's     motion    was   held    on\n\nJanuary 9, 2008. The district court prefaced the hearing by asking\n\nthe parties to address the recent 2007 amendments to Rule 35(b),\n\nwhich had occurred a month earlier.               The government, going first,\n\nexplained that Poland's cooperation alone \"is clearly worthy of\n\nmore than what we have asked for,\" but made its recommendation in\n\norder   to   reflect       Poland's       delay   in   cooperating    until    after\n\nsentencing and his obstruction of justice prior to his decision to\n\ncooperate.           The government then emphasized that Poland's cousin\n\n\"received        a    substantially,      substantially    less     sentence    than\n\nJonathan did,\" that \"the juvenile sentence . . . is not even on the\n\nradar screen,\" and that \"the disparity between the two sentences is\n\ndifficult for me to justify at this point,\" given that \"the\n\njuvenile was more culpable and did more.\"\n\n             When asked by the district court whether the court was\n\npermitted to consider \"the 3553(a) factors,\" and, in particular,\n\nthe   sentencing         disparity   in    reducing    Poland's     sentence,     the\n\ngovernment responded:\n\n             I do, I do. I -- at your request I read the\n             rule, I read the notation, the commentary to\n             the rule, and it was very clear -- I had a\n             discussion with [Poland's counsel] about it,\n             it was clear to both of us -- that, like a\n             typical sentencing, not a re-sentencing or\n             situation such as this, if you were -- you are\n             essentially to treat the Rule 35 motion in the\n             light you would a -- if you were re-sentencing\n             Mr. Poland today because you may look beyond\n             the guidelines at 3553(a) factors.     And the\n             language of the statute used to be simply that\n\n                                          -15-\n\f              you looked at the guidelines, which of course\n              the Court knows is now advisory. So I read\n              that to mean that the book is open in terms of\n              the factors that you may consider both in the\n              advisory guidelines as well as 3553(a) factors\n              in coming to a conclusion as to what\n              percentage of a departure should be imposed if\n              a departure should be imposed.\n\n                     So I do believe you can follow 3553(a).\n              I would encourage the Court to do so.        I\n              certainly   did    so   in   general    terms,\n              theoretically, in coming up with the reasons\n              why a Rule 35 motion was appropriate. But I\n              do think that Mr. Poland has a number of\n              indicia in his case that speak directly to\n              many of the factors in 3553(a), such as the\n              comparison of his behavior to that of a\n              juvenile and the disparity between their\n              sentences.\n\nWhen asked, the government clarified that its recommended sentence\n\nof 48-months did not reflect the disparity between Poland and his\n\ncousin's sentences, but admitted that \"I don't disagree with\n\nanything that [Poland's counsel] said in his response.\"                  The\n\ndistrict court asked if the government's \"agreement that the\n\n[3553(a)] factors can govern reflect your office's consideration of\n\nthe significance of this change?\"           The government responded that\n\nthe \"appellate division\" had not addressed the issue.\n\n              After the hearing, the government attorney consulted with\n\nthe   U.S.    Attorney's   Office    to   determine    its   position.    On\n\nJanuary 10, 2008, the government filed a memorandum clarifying that\n\nposition.     In the memorandum the government stated that \"while the\n\nCourt   may     consider   3553(a)   factors    in    reducing   Defendant's\n\nsentence, it is the Government's position that it may do so only in\n\n                                     -16-\n\fdetermining   to   what   extent   to   reduce   the   sentence   based   on\n\nDefendant's cooperation.\"      Foreshadowing the majority's reasoning,\n\nthe Government then stated that \"the extent of any reduction is\n\nstrictly limited by 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e) in this case as a result of\n\nthe mandatory minimum.\"\n\n          With this background in mind, I stress my discomfort with\n\na sentencing regime (including its mandatory minimum sentences) in\n\nwhich the good faith efforts of the parties and the district court\n\nto do the right thing and reflect the disparity between Poland's\n\nsentence and his cousin's sentence, were essentially derailed by\n\nthe complexity and uncertainty of the existing state of the law.\n\nThe district judge, in fact, stated outright that \"[i]f [it] were\n\nable to consider these additional § 3553(a) factors, [it] would\n\nreduce the defendant's sentence to thirty months.\"            United States\n\nv. Poland, 533 F. Supp. 2d 199, 214 (D. Me. 2008).            Instead, the\n\ndistrict court was reduced to divining the propriety of several\n\nchanges to Rule 35(b) in light of Booker, ultimately expressing\n\nsome concern that a unconstrained interpretation of Rule 35(b) may\n\nviolate the Rules Enabling Act, an Act which, as the sentencing\n\ncourt admitted, has never in its history caused the Supreme Court\n\nto invalidate a rule.     See id. at 210-11 (citing sources).\n\n          I   also   express   disappointment    with   the    government's\n\nchange of position.       That said, the government did go to great\n\npains to point out that the disparity between Poland's sentence and\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\fhis cousin's sentence was \"difficult . . . to justify at this\n\npoint\" and expressed great sympathy with Poland's position that the\n\nsentencing disparity should be considered.               It is troubling that\n\nsuch concerns had to fall by the way side.\n\n           Taken together, the district court's and the government's\n\nactions are indicative of a sentencing regime (in particular, the\n\nmandatory minimum in this case) containing little flexibility.                 In\n\nthe real life scenario of sentencing, such a regime makes little\n\nsense because it takes away much of the discretion from where it\n\nshould be, those on the front lines of the criminal justice system.\n\nOur   sentencing     regime    reflects     the   work   of   persons   with   a\n\nbackground of much theory and little practice in the art of\n\nsentencing.    I do not begrudge the district court for its care in\n\nattempting to reach the right conclusion.            The issue before us is\n\ndifficult, and given the existing state of law, I am forced to\n\nagree   with   the   result.      But   I   am    also   obliged   to   vent   my\n\nfrustration with the situation in which we find ourselves mired, a\n\nsentencing regime plagued with uncertainty and rigidity.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\f",

D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                        Lynch, Chief Judge,\n\n              Torruella and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Judith H. Mizner, Assistant Federal Public Defender, Federal\nPublic Defender's Office, for appellant.\n     Renée M. Bunker, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nPaula D. Silsby, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          April 2, 2009\n\f            BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.           The issue the parties have\n\nframed on this appeal is whether, where the district court adjusts\n\na prior sentence to account for post-sentence cooperation by the\n\ndefendant, the adjustment may reflect factors other than that\n\ncooperation.     We sustain the district court's disposition of this\n\ncase but on a narrower ground, deferring until necessary the larger\n\nissue--which may arise only rarely and implicates a difficult and\n\ndelicate issue of statutory construction.\n\n            The defendant, Jonathan Poland, was eighteen years and\n\nthree months old when he and his seventeen-year old cousin (who was\n\njust shy of his eighteenth birthday) made and detonated two pipe\n\nbombs during the Spring of 2004. Poland was indicted and convicted\n\nof unlawfully possessing an unregistered destructive device, 26\n\nU.S.C. §§ 5861(d), 5841, 5845(f), 5871 (2006), and use of an\n\nexplosive   to   maliciously   damage   or    destroy   property   used   in\n\ninterstate commerce, 18 U.S.C. § 844(i) (2006).\n\n            The explosion caused little damage but was close to a\n\ntruck stop office and fuel of various kinds and so was no minor\n\nprank.   Poland was sentenced to 63 months imprisonment, the three\n\nmonths over and above the mandatory minimum sentence of 60 months\n\nbeing added because he committed perjury during a suppression\n\nhearing.     Poland appealed, but later withdrew the appeal and\n\ncooperated with the government.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\f            The cooperation led to successful government proceedings\n\nagainst    Poland's   cousin    but,    the    matter   having     begun    with   a\n\njuvenile charge, the cousin received a sentence of only three\n\nmonths.    After Poland cooperated, the government moved to reduce\n\nPoland's sentence to 48 months.         Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(b)(1).          Poland\n\nsought a sentence below 48 months, arguing that all of the ordinary\n\nstatutory factors could be considered afresh, see 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3553(a),    and   stressing    the     much   longer    sentence    he     received\n\ncompared to his cousin.\n\n            At a hearing on the motion, the district judge asked the\n\nparties to address the impact of new language in Rule 35(b).                 Under\n\nprecedents    construing      former    versions,      sentencing    courts    may\n\nconsider only the extent of the cooperation given in calculating\n\nthe reduced sentence.          The district court noted that both the\n\nrule's new language and an advisory committee note suggested that\n\non re-sentencing any of the factors identified in 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3553(a) could now be considered.              The pertinent language of the\n\nrespective changes appears below.\n\n            In the end, the district court held that to so read the\n\nnew rule would work a substantive change and violate the Rules\n\nEnabling Act,     28 U.S.C. § 2072(a).

To avoid this outcome, the\n\ndistrict court followed precedent under the old rule and held that\n\n\"the new Rule 35(b) . . . limit[s] the judge, as before the\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\famendment, to consider only substantial assistance factors in\n\nsupport of the amount of a reduction, notwithstanding the amendment\n\nand the Advisory Committee Note.\"    Id. at 211.\n\n          The government's recommendation did not bind the district\n\ncourt, which concluded that a reduction to 40 months properly\n\naccounted for the cooperation provided by Poland.     However, the\n\ncourt said that were it free to consider factors other than\n\ncooperation--in particular \"the need to avoid unwarranted sentence\n\ndisparities among defendants with similar records who have been\n\nfound guilty of similar conduct,\" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6)--it would\n\nreduce Poland's sentence to 30 months.    Id. at 213-14.\n\n          Poland now appeals, arguing that under the current Rule\n\n35(b), the judge was free once the motion was made to consider\n\nfactors other than cooperation in reducing the sentence.

Before\n\nthe sentencing guidelines, Rule 35(b) permitted a sentencing judge\n\nto reduce a sentence, more or less without condition, within 120\n\ndays of the sentence or disposition of any appeal.       This open ended\n\napproach was substantially altered by the Sentencing Reform Act of\n\n1984, Pub. L. No. 98-473, Title II, 98 Stat. 1987 (\"the Reform\n\nAct\"), which adopted a framework for sentencing guidelines that\n\naimed    at    restricting   the   discretion   of   judges   in   initial\n\nsentencing.\n\n              Consonantly, the Reform Act limited the judge's authority\n\nto alter a final sentence, confining it to three categories, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3582(c), of which only one directly concerns us.              It\n\nreads:\n\n              The   court  may  not   modify  a   term  of\n              imprisonment once it has been imposed except\n              that--\n\n              (1) in any case--\n              ....\n\n              (B) the court may modify     an imposed term of\n              imprisonment to the extent   otherwise expressly\n              permitted by statute or      by Rule 35 of the\n              Federal Rules of Criminal    Procedure . . . .\n\nThe Reform Act also rewrote Rule 35(b) to provide:\n\n              The court, on motion of the Government, may\n              within one year after the imposition of a\n              sentence, lower a sentence to reflect a\n              defendant's subsequent, substantial assistance\n              in the investigation or prosecution of another\n              person who has committed an offense, in\n\n                                    -5-\n\f           accordance with the guidelines and policy\n           statements issued by the Sentencing Commission\n           . . . .\n\nReform Act of 1984, § 212(b)(emphasis added).\n\n           Before the Reform Act became effective in 1987, Congress\n\nagain added provisions to both 18 U.S.C. and to Rule 35, which\n\nfurnished the district court authority, in both initial sentencing\n\nand re-sentencing, to impose sentences below prescribed statutory\n\nminimums based on a government substantial assistance motion, Anti-\n\nDrug Abuse Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-570, Title I, §§ 1007, 1009,\n\n100 Stat. 3207-08 (1986); but we defer discussion of those changes.\n\n           Given the underscored language of Rule 35(b) as amended\n\nby the 1984 Reform Act--\"to reflect a defendant's subsequent,\n\nsubstantial   assistance\"--other     circuit    courts    (unsurprisingly)\n\nconcluded that only the defendant's substantial assistance could be\n\nconsidered in granting or measuring a Rule 35(b) reduction.

Chavarria-Herrara, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"661826\"><a href=\"/opinion/661826/united-states-v-bernal-chavarria-herrara/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1033</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1037 (11th Cir.\n\n1994).

Thereafter, apparently believing\n\nthat       Booker   required   this   change,   the   advisory   committee\n\nrecommended deletion of Rule 35(b)'s then existing requirement that\n\na sentence reduction \"accord[] with the Sentencing Commission's\n\nGuidelines and policy statements,\"3 and the deletion was adopted\n\nthrough the rules process effective December 1, 2007.\n\n              Rule 35(b) now reads in relevant part, and so read when\n\nthe district court considered the government motion in this case,\n\nas follows:\n\n              Upon the government's motion made within one\n              year of sentencing, the court may reduce a\n              sentence if the defendant, after sentencing,\n              provided    substantial     assistance     in\n              investigating or prosecuting another person.\n\nIf this language alone were considered, Poland might well plausibly\n\nargue that a re-sentencing court could, in granting a substantial\n\nassistance motion, consider other factors and not just substantial\n\nassistance in setting the new sentence.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      Memorandum from Booker Subcomm. to Advisory Comm. on Criminal\nRules,      4     (Mar.      15,     2005),      available       at\nhttp://www.uscourts.gov/rules/Agenda_Books.htm#criminal.

The jury trial\n\nconcerns that led to invalidating mandatory guidelines for initial\n\nsentencing do not bear equally on every regulation of sentencing.\n\nBooker's Sixth Amendment rationale built on a tension with jury\n\ntrial values insofar as the guidelines mandated an increased\n\npenalty because of additional conduct (e.g., using a gun, harming\n\na victim) found only by the judge rather than the jury.\n\n           Neither the language of Booker nor its rationale appears\n\nto constrain Congress' power to delimit, whether by guideline or\n\notherwise, the conditions on which judges may reduce sentences once\n\nimposed; Congress can surely decide whether and when any reductions\n\nare allowed and surely as well who should make the downward\n\nadjustment and on what basis.

Cir. 1999) (noting Rule 35(b), § 3553(e), and §\n\n5K1.1 are to be read \"in pari materia\").       For mandatory minimums,\n\nbut perhaps only for mandatory minimums, the 2002 deletion of the\n\n\"reflects\" language in the rule may be merely \"stylistic.\"\n\n           To put the matter differently, we hold that for re-\n\nsentence adjustments that go below the statutory mandatory minimum,\n\nRule 35(b) must be read in conformity with 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e).\n\nCongress has never changed the statutory rule that such reductions\n\nmust reflect only the assistance provided.       Nor is there anything\n\nin the \"legislative history\" of changes to Rule 35(b) that reflects\n\nany desire to create a discrepancy for post-sentence adjustments\n\nbelow the mandatory minimum.\n\n           Poland's    statutory   mandatory   minimum   sentence   is   60\n\nmonths.   The district court was entitled to reduce the sentence to\n\nreflect the assistance provided, which it calculated to justify a\n\nsentence of 40 months.       It could not, as we read Rule 35(b),\n\nprovide a greater reduction below the mandatory minimum for any\n\nother reason.   This disposes of Poland's reliance on comparability\n\nwith his cousin, any alternative interpretation of U.S.S.G. § 5K1.1\n\nor otherwise pertinent sentencing factors prescribed by Congress.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n                       -Concurring Opinion Follows-\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\f           TORRUELLA,   Circuit     Judge    (Concurring).     I     join   the\n\nresult, but write separately to express my views on our current\n\nsentencing regime as it affected this case.\n\n           As set forth below, all of the parties, including the\n\ndistrict   court,   agreed   that   the     sentencing   disparity    between\n\nPoland's sentence and his cousin's juvenile sentence supported a\n\nsentencing reduction to lessen that disparity.           The plain text of\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b), after amendments made to\n\nit in 2002 and 2007, permitted such a reduction.           The parties and\n\nthe district court, however, got caught up in the minutiae of\n\nwhether those amendments, the latter inspired by Booker, allowed\n\nthe district court to provide such a reduction.           Although I agree\n\nwith the ultimate result given the existing state of the law, and\n\nthus join the majority's affirmance, I find the events that led to\n\nthat result troubling.\n\n           In order to understand my concerns, I will provide some\n\nbackground that was not essential to the majority opinion but is\n\nrelevant here.      After Poland cooperated, the government filed a\n\nmotion to reduce Poland's sentence under Rule 35(b), recommending\n\na 48-month sentence.    Poland filed a responsive memorandum, urging\n\nthe district court to look beyond the factors outlined in U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 5k1.1 and consider all factors under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).            Poland\n\nspecifically asked the court to consider the disparity between\n\nPoland's sentence (63 months) and his cousin's (3 months).\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\f             A       hearing   on   the   government's     motion    was   held    on\n\nJanuary 9, 2008. The district court prefaced the hearing by asking\n\nthe parties to address the recent 2007 amendments to Rule 35(b),\n\nwhich had occurred a month earlier.               The government, going first,\n\nexplained that Poland's cooperation alone \"is clearly worthy of\n\nmore than what we have asked for,\" but made its recommendation in\n\norder   to   reflect       Poland's       delay   in   cooperating    until    after\n\nsentencing and his obstruction of justice prior to his decision to\n\ncooperate.           The government then emphasized that Poland's cousin\n\n\"received        a    substantially,      substantially    less     sentence    than\n\nJonathan did,\" that \"the juvenile sentence . . . is not even on the\n\nradar screen,\" and that \"the disparity between the two sentences is\n\ndifficult for me to justify at this point,\" given that \"the\n\njuvenile was more culpable and did more.\"\n\n             When asked by the district court whether the court was\n\npermitted to consider \"the 3553(a) factors,\" and, in particular,\n\nthe   sentencing         disparity   in    reducing    Poland's     sentence,     the\n\ngovernment responded:\n\n             I do, I do. I -- at your request I read the\n             rule, I read the notation, the commentary to\n             the rule, and it was very clear -- I had a\n             discussion with [Poland's counsel] about it,\n             it was clear to both of us -- that, like a\n             typical sentencing, not a re-sentencing or\n             situation such as this, if you were -- you are\n             essentially to treat the Rule 35 motion in the\n             light you would a -- if you were re-sentencing\n             Mr. Poland today because you may look beyond\n             the guidelines at 3553(a) factors.     And the\n             language of the statute used to be simply that\n\n                                          -15-\n\f              you looked at the guidelines, which of course\n              the Court knows is now advisory. So I read\n              that to mean that the book is open in terms of\n              the factors that you may consider both in the\n              advisory guidelines as well as 3553(a) factors\n              in coming to a conclusion as to what\n              percentage of a departure should be imposed if\n              a departure should be imposed.\n\n                     So I do believe you can follow 3553(a).\n              I would encourage the Court to do so.        I\n              certainly   did    so   in   general    terms,\n              theoretically, in coming up with the reasons\n              why a Rule 35 motion was appropriate. But I\n              do think that Mr. Poland has a number of\n              indicia in his case that speak directly to\n              many of the factors in 3553(a), such as the\n              comparison of his behavior to that of a\n              juvenile and the disparity between their\n              sentences.\n\nWhen asked, the government clarified that its recommended sentence\n\nof 48-months did not reflect the disparity between Poland and his\n\ncousin's sentences, but admitted that \"I don't disagree with\n\nanything that [Poland's counsel] said in his response.\"                  The\n\ndistrict court asked if the government's \"agreement that the\n\n[3553(a)] factors can govern reflect your office's consideration of\n\nthe significance of this change?\"           The government responded that\n\nthe \"appellate division\" had not addressed the issue.\n\n              After the hearing, the government attorney consulted with\n\nthe   U.S.    Attorney's   Office    to   determine    its   position.    On\n\nJanuary 10, 2008, the government filed a memorandum clarifying that\n\nposition.     In the memorandum the government stated that \"while the\n\nCourt   may     consider   3553(a)   factors    in    reducing   Defendant's\n\nsentence, it is the Government's position that it may do so only in\n\n                                     -16-\n\fdetermining   to   what   extent   to   reduce   the   sentence   based   on\n\nDefendant's cooperation.\"      Foreshadowing the majority's reasoning,\n\nthe Government then stated that \"the extent of any reduction is\n\nstrictly limited by 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e) in this case as a result of\n\nthe mandatory minimum.\"\n\n          With this background in mind, I stress my discomfort with\n\na sentencing regime (including its mandatory minimum sentences) in\n\nwhich the good faith efforts of the parties and the district court\n\nto do the right thing and reflect the disparity between Poland's\n\nsentence and his cousin's sentence, were essentially derailed by\n\nthe complexity and uncertainty of the existing state of the law.\n\nThe district judge, in fact, stated outright that \"[i]f [it] were\n\nable to consider these additional § 3553(a) factors, [it] would\n\nreduce the defendant's sentence to thirty months.\"            United States\n\nv.

Instead, the\n\ndistrict court was reduced to divining the propriety of several\n\nchanges to Rule 35(b) in light of Booker, ultimately expressing\n\nsome concern that a unconstrained interpretation of Rule 35(b) may\n\nviolate the Rules Enabling Act, an Act which, as the sentencing\n\ncourt admitted, has never in its history caused the Supreme Court\n\nto invalidate a rule.     See id. at 210-11 (citing sources).\n\n          I   also   express   disappointment    with   the    government's\n\nchange of position.       That said, the government did go to great\n\npains to point out that the disparity between Poland's sentence and\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\fhis cousin's sentence was \"difficult . . . to justify at this\n\npoint\" and expressed great sympathy with Poland's position that the\n\nsentencing disparity should be considered.               It is troubling that\n\nsuch concerns had to fall by the way side.\n\n           Taken together, the district court's and the government's\n\nactions are indicative of a sentencing regime (in particular, the\n\nmandatory minimum in this case) containing little flexibility.                 In\n\nthe real life scenario of sentencing, such a regime makes little\n\nsense because it takes away much of the discretion from where it\n\nshould be, those on the front lines of the criminal justice system.\n\nOur   sentencing     regime    reflects     the   work   of   persons   with   a\n\nbackground of much theory and little practice in the art of\n\nsentencing.    I do not begrudge the district court for its care in\n\nattempting to reach the right conclusion.            The issue before us is\n\ndifficult, and given the existing state of law, I am forced to\n\nagree   with   the   result.      But   I   am    also   obliged   to   vent   my\n\nfrustration with the situation in which we find ourselves mired, a\n\nsentencing regime plagued with uncertainty and rigidity.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\f</pre>",
