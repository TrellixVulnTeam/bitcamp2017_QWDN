Plaintiff-appellant Nydia\n\nEstades   Negroni     (\"Estades\")       brought     an   action    against     the\n\nAssociates    Corp.   of    North     America    (\"Associates     Corporation\"),\n\nAssociates Financial Services (\"Associates\"), Associates First\n\nCapital     Corp.,    and    Associates       Corporation    of    Puerto      Rico\n\n(collectively    \"defendants\"),         alleging    unlawful      discrimination\n\nbecause of her age and disability in contravention of the Age\n\nDiscrimination in Employment Act (\"ADEA\"), 29 U.S.C. §§ 621-634\n\n(2003), the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 12182-12189 (2003), and several provisions of Puerto Rico law.\n\nThe district     court      granted    summary    judgment   in   favor   of    the\n\ndefendants; Estades now appeals.          After careful review, we affirm.\n\n                                I.    Background1\n\n            Estades was hired by Associates in 1986.               Between 1989\n\nand 1990, she became aware of financial irregularities regarding\n\nloans carried out by some of her co-workers in Associates' Arecibo\n\nI branch.     In 1992, Estades reported the irregularities to Juan\n\nIrizarry, Group Assistant Vice President at Associates, through his\n\nsecretary, Haydeé López.        As a result of Estades's allegations of\n\nfraud, several audits were performed that resulted in the firing of\n\nseveral of her co-workers, including her supervisors, in 1993.\n\n\n1\n  We largely reproduce the facts as stated in the district court's\nopinion, Estades Negroni v. Assocs. Corp. of N. Am., 208 F. Supp.\n2d 144, 145 (D.P.R. 2002), but present them in the light most\nfavorable to the plaintiff. Rosenberg v. City of Everett, 328 F.3d\n12, 17 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n                                        -2-\n\f            After she reported the irregularities, Estades alleges\n\nshe experienced a \"pattern of discrimination.\"                According to\n\nEstades's   brief,   \"her   supervisors     were   bothered   by   Estades's\n\nwhistle-blowing activities.\"       Estades contends that, as a result,\n\nher workload was increased to the point of being \"excessive.\"\n\nEstades also claims that she requested her workload be reduced to\n\nits original level or that an assistant be hired; her employer\n\nrefused both requests. She also alleges that the director of human\n\nresources, at least one of her supervisors, and several of her co-\n\nworkers at Associates made \"age motivated remarks.\"2\n\n            In   March   1996,   Estades   experienced   chest     pains   and\n\nvisited a doctor, who diagnosed her with severe depression.                On\n\nMarch 21, 1996, Estades, following her doctor's recommendation,\n\nreported to the State Insurance Fund (\"SIF\").            The SIF examined\n\nEstades and found her to be disabled; she was placed on leave to\n\nreceive medical treatment.\n\n            On April 9, 1996, Estades requested short-term disability\n\nbenefits under Associates' employee benefits policy (the \"Policy\").\n\nThe Policy was administered by Associates Corporation and managed\n\n\n\n2\n   Estades's brief extensively cites to her own deposition and\nthose of Irizarry and Wilfredo Ortíz Guerra in cataloguing the\nallegedly ageist remarks made by her supervisors and co-workers.\nAlthough our prior opinion was withdrawn to permit consideration of\nseveral of appellant's evidentiary submissions in English, our re-\nexamination of the case leads us to affirm dismissal of the ADEA\nclaim based on the alternative rationale relied upon by the\ndistrict court.\n\n                                    -3-\n\fby Prudential Healthcare Group (\"Prudential\").              Estades received\n\nshort-term disability benefits for the maximum period possible,\n\nfrom March 1996 to September 1996.\n\n            On May 2, 1996, Carmen Hernández, a social worker with\n\nthe SIF, interviewed Estades in connection with her request for\n\ntreatment.     SIF referred Estades to Dr. Pablo Pérez Torredo, a\n\npsychiatrist, for evaluation.        On June 18, 1996, Dr. Pérez Torredo\n\nissued   his   final   psychiatric    report,    diagnosing    Estades   with\n\nadaptive disorder with mixed emotional symptoms and recommending\n\nthat she receive additional psychotherapeutic treatment.\n\n            On August 23, 1996, Associates notified Estades that her\n\nshort-term disability benefits would expire on September 27, 1996.\n\nAssociates further informed Estades of her right to apply for\n\nlong-term disability benefits (\"LTD\") and recommended that she also\n\napply for Social Security Disability Insurance benefits (\"SSDI\") to\n\nsupplement her income.\n\n            On September 25, 1996, Estades applied for LTD.            In her\n\napplication, Estades certified that her emotional state did not\n\nallow her to concentrate on or to perform her job functions.\n\nFurthermore, she indicated that the date for her return to work was\n\nnot available, and that she did not expect to return to any other\n\noccupation.\n\n            In a letter dated January 7, 1997, Prudential denied\n\nEstades's    request   for   LTD   based   on   lack   of   medical   evidence\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fsupporting her claim that her condition kept her from performing\n\nher duties       as   Branch   Operations     Manager.    The   denial   letter\n\ninformed her of her right to appeal the denial of LTD.                   Estades\n\nappealed Prudential's decision in a letter dated February 25, 1997.\n\n            On March 19, 1997, Estades's employment with Associates\n\nwas terminated with an effective date of February 28, 1997, because\n\nher short-term disability benefits had expired, her application for\n\nLTD had been denied, and she had not reported to work.                        On\n\nApril 15, 1997, Prudential reconsidered its denial of LTD and\n\napproved Estades's request retroactively to September 18, 1996.\n\nEstades was reinstated in her employment with Associates with LTD\n\nstatus.     As part of her LTD benefits, Estades was entitled to\n\nreceive 60 percent of her salary while undergoing treatment.                  On\n\nMay 2, 1997, Estades sent a letter to Associates stating her desire\n\nto return to work on June 1, 1997.\n\n            Prudential informed Estades that if her recovery was\n\ndelayed she could be required to apply for SSDI.             She applied, and\n\non July 7, 1997, she was granted SSDI retroactively to September\n\n1996.     The Social Security Administration found that, under its\n\nrules, she had become disabled on March 20, 1996.\n\n            On    April   29,   1998,    Aetna   US    Healthcare   (\"Aetna\"),\n\nAssociates' new health insurance carrier, sent Estades a letter\n\nstating that, based on the medical information in their possession,\n\nher claim for LTD had been approved.                  Aetna further informed\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fEstades that, under a plan provision, she was required to file for\n\nSSDI benefits and to provide them with proof of application.              The\n\nletter further informed Estades that failure to comply would result\n\nin suspension and termination of benefits.\n\n            Rather than comply with Aetna's request, Estades told\n\nAetna to ask Prudential for a copy of her SSDI award letter.\n\nEstades stated that she refused to provide Aetna with a copy of the\n\nletter because \"they had been so bad to her.\"\n\n            On June 2, 1998, Aetna sent Estades a second letter\n\nrequesting that she inform the company of the status of her SSDI\n\napplication.       On August 11, 1998, Aetna sent Estades a letter\n\ninforming her that her LTD benefits were terminated effective\n\nJuly 31, 1998, because Aetna had not received from Estades any\n\nproof that she had at least applied for SSDI.                  Aetna further\n\ninformed Estades that she was entitled to petition for a review of\n\nthat decision within sixty days.        She appealed, but the appeal was\n\ndenied on October 1, 1998, because Aetna had not received a copy of\n\nher SSDI award letter.     After October 1, 1998, Estades did not make\n\nany further efforts to obtain LTD.             Estades has not contacted\n\nAssociates regarding her availability or desire to return to work\n\nsince her LTD was terminated in August 1998.\n\n            Estades is currently undergoing psychiatric treatment and\n\nhas   not   made   any   attempt   to   find   another   job    because   her\n\npsychiatrist has told her she is still unable to work.\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\f          On June 5, 1998, Estades filed a complaint against\n\ndefendants alleging that they violated the ADEA and the ADA, and\n\nraising supplemental law claims under Puerto Rico Law.3\n\n          The defendants moved for summary judgment on all claims.\n\nThe motion was referred to a magistrate judge, who recommended that\n\nthe court grant the motion for summary judgment. Estades filed her\n\nobjections to the report and recommendation.\n\n          On May 30, 2002, the district court issued an opinion and\n\norder adopting the magistrate judge's report and recommendation and\n\ndismissing Estades's causes of action under the ADEA and the ADA.\n\nThe district court dismissed the supplemental state law claims\n\nwithout prejudice because no federal claims to ground original\n\njurisdiction remained before the court.    Estades now appeals the\n\ndistrict court's grant of summary judgment and dismissal of her\n\nstate claims.\n\n                          II.   Analysis\n\n          Summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine\n\nissue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to a\n\njudgment as a matter of law based on the pleadings, depositions,\n\nanswers to interrogatories, admissions on file, and any affidavits.\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).   We review a grant of summary judgment de\n\nnovo, construing the record in the light most favorable to Estades,\n\n\n\n3\n   Plaintiff filed her complaint before Aetna terminated her LTD\nbenefits.\n\n                                -7-\n\fthe non-movant.      Rosenberg, 328 F.3d at 17.      We may affirm the\n\ndistrict court's decision on any grounds supported by the record.\n\nRodríguez v. Smithkline Beecham, 224 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\nA.   Age Discrimination Claim\n\n           Estades argues that the district court erred in granting\n\nsummary judgment on the ADEA claim because she presented direct\n\nevidence of age discrimination. In the alternative, Estades claims\n\nsummary judgment should not have been granted with regard to the\n\nprima facie case because a genuine issue of material fact exists\n\nregarding whether she was actually or constructively discharged.\n\n           The ADEA makes it \"unlawful for an employer . . . to\n\ndischarge any individual . . . because of such individual's age.\"\n\n29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1).     In an ADEA case, the plaintiff bears the\n\nburden of proving [s]he would not have been discharged \"but for\n\n[her] age.\"   Serrano-Cruz v. DFI P.R., Inc., 109 F.3d 23, 25 (1st\n\nCir. 1997).   It goes without saying that a plaintiff's failure to\n\npresent a triable question of material fact as to her having\n\nsuffered an adverse employment action dooms an ADEA claim from the\n\nstart.   Under the circumstances of this case, we begin, therefore,\n\nby considering whether the record supports her claim to have\n\nsuffered an adverse employment action at the hands of Associates.\n\n           When she first became ill, Estades applied for and\n\nobtained short-term disability benefits under Associates' employee\n\nbenefits   policy.     Before   those   benefits   expired,   Associates\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fnotified Estades that she could apply for long-term disability\n\nbenefits and recommended that she apply for SSDI.            The insurer,\n\nPrudential, at first denied her request for LTD, but notified her\n\nof the right to appeal which she exercised.         As a matter of fact,\n\nEstades's employment with Associates was terminated as of February\n\n28, 1997.    Once Estades obtained a favorable appeal of her LTD\n\ndenial on April 15, 1997, she was reinstated retroactively and with\n\nbenefits.\n\n            We find that this sequence of events does not contain a\n\ndischarge   actionable    under   the     ADEA.    Neither   do   Estades's\n\nsubsequent difficulties with AETNA, ultimately resulting in the\n\ntermination of her long-term disability benefits, establish that\n\nAssociates discharged her. Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of\n\nEstades's ADEA claim, agreeing with the district court that she\n\nfailed at the threshold to support the claim that she suffered an\n\nadverse employment action.\n\nB.   Failure to Accommodate Claim\n\n            Estades also claims that Associates violated the ADA by\n\nrefusing    to   grant   the   accommodations     she   requested,    namely\n\nreduction of her workload or provision of an assistant.4             The ADA\n\nprohibits discrimination against \"a qualified individual with a\n\ndisability because of the disability of such individual in regard\n\n\n4\n   Neither Estades's complaint nor her briefs before this court\npresent any claim that she was discharged because of her\ndisability. Rather, she focuses on the issue of accommodation.\n\n                                    -9-\n\fto . . . terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.\" 42\n\nU.S.C. § 12112(a).     An employer violates the ADA if it \"knows of a\n\ndisability yet fails to make reasonable accommodations.\"           Higgins\n\nv. New Balance Athletic Shoe, Inc., 194 F.3d 252, 264 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).     To   survive     summary   judgment      on   her   \"reasonable\n\naccommodation claim, [Estades] must produce enough evidence for a\n\nreasonable jury to find that (1) [s]he is disabled within the\n\nmeaning of the ADA, (2) [s]he was able to perform the essential\n\nfunctions of the job with or without a reasonable accommodation,\n\nand (3) [Associates], despite knowing of [Estades]'s disability,\n\ndid not reasonably accommodate it.\"          Rocafort v. IBM Corp., 334\n\nF.3d 115, 119 (1st Cir. 2003).     We focus our attention on the third\n\nprong: whether Associates knew of Estades's disability yet failed\n\nto accommodate her.5\n\n          Before     she   was   diagnosed   with   depression,    Estades\n\nrequested a reduced workload or the aid of an assistant.          Under the\n\nADA, requests for accommodation must be express and must be linked\n\nto a disability.      See Cruz Carrillo v. AMR Eagle, Inc., 148 F.\n\n\n5\n   Estades also discusses her qualification to perform the job.\nThe district court states that \"Estades failed to proffer\nsufficient evidence that she could perform her duties with or\nwithout any reasonable accommodations as required by the ADA,\" but\nmakes no further comment on this prong. Estades Negroni, 208 F.\nSupp. 2d at 148.     Because we find Estades failed to present\nsufficient evidence on the third prong, we need not address whether\nshe could perform her duties.      Cf. Rocafort, 334 F.3d at 119\n(\"assum[ing], without deciding,\" that defendant met his burden with\nregard to the first two prongs where plaintiff failed to meet\nburden on the third prong).\n\n                                   -10-\n\fSupp. 2d 142, 146 (D.P.R. 2001).               An employer need not provide\n\naccommodations where it does not know an employee has a disability.\n\nSee Reed v. Lepage Bakeries, Inc., 244 F.3d 254, 261 (1st Cir.\n\n2001) (\"The employer has no duty to divine the need for a special\n\naccommodation where the employee merely makes a mundane request for\n\na change at the workplace.\"); see also EEOC, Enforcement Guidance:\n\nReasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans\n\nwith Disabilities Act, FEP (BNA) 405: 7601, at 7605-06 (March 1,\n\n1999) (\"before addressing the merits of the accommodation request,\n\nthe    employer     needs   to    determine    if    the    individual's      medical\n\ncondition meets the ADA definition of 'disability,' a prerequisite\n\nfor the individual to be entitled to a reasonable accommodation\"),\n\navailable          at    http://www.eeoc.gov/docs/accommodation.html.\n\nAssociates did not know Estades was disabled when she requested the\n\naccommodation -- she had not yet been diagnosed with a disability\n\nat    the   time   she   sought    a   reduced      workload      or   an   assistant.\n\nAlthough Estades argues that her depression was evident when she\n\nrequested the accommodation, the record does not support this\n\nclaim.       Finally,    there    is   no   evidence       that    the   request   was\n\nexpressly repeated after Estades was diagnosed with a mental\n\ndisability.\n\n             We uphold the grant of summary judgment on the ADA claim\n\nbecause Associates was unaware of Estades's disability when it\n\ndenied her requested accommodation.\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fC.   State Law Claims\n\n           The   district   court    acted   \"well   within   its   broad\n\ndiscretion\" in refusing to exercise supplemental jurisdiction and\n\ndismissing without prejudice the state law claims because no\n\nfederal claims remained.    Lares Group, II v. Tobin, 221 F.3d 41, 45\n\n(1st Cir. 2000).\n\n                            III.    Conclusion\n\n           For the foregoing reasons, the district court's grant of\n\nsummary judgment is affirmed.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\f",

She also alleges that the director of human resources, at least one of her supervisors, and several of her co-workers at Associates made \"age motivated remarks.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1996, Estades experienced chest pains and visited a doctor, who diagnosed her with severe depression. On March 21, 1996, Estades, following her doctor's recommendation, reported to the State Insurance Fund (\"SIF\"). The SIF examined Estades and found her to be disabled; she was placed on leave to receive medical treatment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 9, 1996, Estades requested short-term disability benefits under Associates' employee benefits policy (the \"Policy\"). The Policy was administered by Associates Corporation and managed by Prudential Healthcare Group (\"Prudential\"). Estades received short-term disability benefits for the maximum period possible, from March 1996 to September 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 2, 1996, Carmen Hernandez, a social worker with the SIF, interviewed Estades in connection with her request for treatment. SIF referred Estades to Dr. Pablo P&#233;rez Torredo, a psychiatrist, for evaluation. On June 18, 1996, Dr. Perez Torredo issued his final psychiatric report, diagnosing Estades with adaptive disorder with mixed emotional symptoms and recommending that she receive additional psychotherapeutic treatment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 23, 1996, Associates notified Estades that her short-term disability benefits would expire on September 27, 1996. Associates further informed Estades of her right to apply for long-term disability benefits (\"LTD\") and recommended that she also apply for Social Security Disability Insurance benefits (\"SSDI\") to supplement her income.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 25, 1996, Estades applied for LTD. In her application, Estades certified that her emotional state did not allow her to concentrate on or to perform her job functions. Furthermore, she indicated that the date for her return to work was not available, and that she did not expect to return to any other occupation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a letter dated January 7, 1997, Prudential denied Estades's request for LTD based on lack of medical evidence supporting her claim that her condition kept her from performing her duties as Branch Operations Manager. The denial letter informed her of her right to appeal the denial of LTD. Estades appealed Prudential's decision in a letter dated February 25, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 19, 1997, Estades's employment with Associates was terminated with an effective date of February 28, 1997, because her short-term disability benefits had expired, her application for LTD had been denied, and she had not reported to work. On April 15, 1997, Prudential reconsidered its denial of LTD and approved Estades's request retroactively to September 18, 1996. Estades was reinstated in her employment with Associates with LTD status. As part of her LTD benefits, Estades was entitled to receive 60 percent of her salary while undergoing treatment. On May 2, 1997, Estades sent a letter to Associates stating her desire to return to work on June 1, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prudential informed Estades that if her recovery was delayed she could be required to apply for SSDI. She applied, and on July 7, 1997, she was granted SSDI retroactively to September 1996. The Social Security Administration found that, under its rules, she had become disabled on March 20, 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 29, 1998, Aetna U.S. Healthcare (\"Aetna\"), Associates' new health insurance carrier, sent Estades a letter stating that, based on the medical information in their possession, her claim for LTD had been approved. Aetna further informed Estades that, under a plan provision, she was required to file for SSDI benefits and to provide them with proof of application. The letter further informed Estades that failure to comply would result in suspension and termination of benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather than comply with Aetna's request, Estades told Aetna to ask Prudential for a copy of her SSDI award letter. Estades stated that she refused to provide Aetna with a copy of the letter because \"they had been so bad to her.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 2, 1998, Aetna sent Estades a second letter requesting that she inform the company of the status of her SSDI application. On August 11, 1998, Aetna sent Estades a letter informing her that her LTD benefits were terminated effective July 31, 1998, because Aetna had not received from Estades any proof that she had at least applied for SSDI. Aetna further informed Estades that she was entitled to petition for a review of that decision within sixty days. She appealed, but the appeal was denied on October 1, 1998, because Aetna had not received a copy of her SSDI award letter. After October 1, 1998, Estades did not make any further efforts to obtain LTD. Estades has not contacted Associates regarding her availability or desire to return to work since her LTD was terminated in August 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Estades is currently undergoing psychiatric treatment and has not made any attempt to find another job because her psychiatrist has told her she is still unable to work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 5, 1998, Estades filed a complaint against defendants alleging that they violated the ADEA and the ADA, and raising supplemental law claims under Puerto Rico Law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants moved for summary judgment on all claims. The motion was referred to a magistrate judge, who recommended that the court grant the motion for summary judgment. Estades filed her objections to the report and recommendation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 30, 2002, the district court issued an opinion and order adopting the magistrate judge's report and recommendation and dismissing Estades's causes of action under the ADEA and the ADA. The district court dismissed the supplemental state law claims without prejudice because no federal claims to ground original jurisdiction remained before the court. Estades now appeals the district court's grant of summary judgment and dismissal of her state claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Analysis</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law based on the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions on file, and any affidavits. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, construing the record in the light most favorable to Estades, the non-movant. <i>Rosenberg,</i> 328 F.3d at 17. We may affirm the district court's decision on any grounds supported by the record. <i>Rodr&#237;guez v. Smithkline Beecham,</i> 224 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Age Discrimination Claim</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Estades argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on the ADEA claim because she presented direct evidence of age discrimination. In the alternative, Estades claims summary judgment should not have been granted with regard to the prima facie case because a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding whether she was actually or constructively discharged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ADEA makes it \"unlawful for an employer ... to discharge any individual ... because of such individual's age.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 623(a)(1). In an ADEA case, the plaintiff bears the burden of proving [s]he would not have been discharged \"but for [her] age.\" <i>Serrano-Cruz v. DFI P.R., Inc.,</i> 109 F.3d 23, 25 (1st Cir.1997). It goes without saying that a plaintiff's failure to present a triable question of material fact as to her having suffered an adverse employment action dooms an ADEA claim from the start. Under the circumstances of this case, we begin, therefore, by considering whether the record supports her claim to have suffered an adverse employment action at the hands of Associates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When she first became ill, Estades applied for and obtained short-term disability benefits under Associates' employee benefits policy. Before those benefits expired, Associates notified Estades that she could apply for long-term disability benefits and recommended that she apply for SSDI. The insurer, Prudential, at first denied her request for LTD, but notified her of the right to appeal which she exercised. As a matter of fact, Estades's employment with Associates was terminated as of February 28, 1997. Once Estades obtained a favorable appeal of her LTD denial on April 15, 1997, she was reinstated <i>retroactively</i> and <i>with benefits.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that this sequence of events does not contain a discharge actionable under the ADEA. Neither do Estades's subsequent difficulties with AETNA, ultimately resulting in the termination of her long-term disability benefits, establish that Associates discharged her. Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of Estades's ADEA claim, agreeing with the district court that she failed at the threshold to support the claim that she suffered an adverse employment action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Failure to Accommodate Claim</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Estades also claims that Associates violated the ADA by refusing to grant the accommodations she requested, namely reduction of her workload or provision of an assistant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The ADA prohibits discrimination against \"a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to ... terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12112(a). An employer violates the ADA if it \"knows of a disability yet fails to make reasonable accommodations.\" <i>Higgins v. New Balance Athletic Shoe, Inc.,</i> 194 F.3d 252, 264 (1st Cir.1999). To survive summary judgment on her \"reasonable accommodation claim, [Estades] must produce enough evidence for a reasonable jury to find that (1)[s]he is disabled within the meaning of the ADA, (2)[s]he was able to perform the essential functions of the job with or without a reasonable accommodation, and (3) [Associates], despite knowing of [Estades]'s disability, did not reasonably accommodate it.\" <i>Rocafort v. IBM Corp.,</i> 334 F.3d 115, 119 (1st Cir.2003). We focus our attention on the third prong: whether Associates knew of Estades's disability yet failed to accommodate her.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before she was diagnosed with depression, Estades requested a reduced workload or the aid of an assistant. Under the ADA, requests for accommodation must be express and must be linked to a disability. <i>See Cruz Carrillo v. AMR Eagle, Inc.,</i> 148 F.Supp.2d 142, 146 (D.P.R.2001). An employer need not provide accommodations where it does not know an employee has a disability. <i>See Reed v. LePage Bakeries, Inc.,</i> 244 F.3d 254, 261 (1st Cir.2001) (\"The employer has no duty to divine the need for a special accommodation where the employee merely makes a mundane request for a change at the workplace.\"); <i>see also</i> EEOC, <i>Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act,</i> FEP (BNA) 405: 7601, at 7605-06 (March 1, 1999) (\"before addressing the merits of the accommodation request, the employer needs to determine if the individual's medical condition meets the ADA definition of `disability,' a prerequisite for the individual to be entitled to a reasonable accommodation\"), <i>available at</i> http://www.eeoc.gov/docs/accommodation.html. Associates did not know Estades was disabled when she requested the accommodation &#8212; she had not yet been diagnosed with a disability at the time she sought a reduced workload or an assistant. Although Estades argues that her depression was evident when she requested the accommodation, the record does not support this claim. Finally, there is no evidence that the request was expressly repeated after Estades was diagnosed with a mental disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We uphold the grant of summary judgment on the ADA claim because Associates was unaware of Estades's disability when it denied her requested accommodation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>State Law Claims</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court acted \"well within its broad discretion\" in refusing to exercise supplemental jurisdiction and dismissing without prejudice the state law claims because no federal claims remained. <i>Lares Group, II v.

Aetna further informed Estades that, under a plan provision, she was required to file for SSDI benefits and to provide them with proof of application. The letter further informed Estades that failure to comply would result in suspension and termination of benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather than comply with Aetna's request, Estades told Aetna to ask Prudential for a copy of her SSDI award letter. Estades stated that she refused to provide Aetna with a copy of the letter because \"they had been so bad to her.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 2, 1998, Aetna sent Estades a second letter requesting that she inform the company of the status of her SSDI application. On August 11, 1998, Aetna sent Estades a letter informing her that her LTD benefits were terminated effective July 31, 1998, because Aetna had not received from Estades any proof that she had at least applied for SSDI. Aetna further informed Estades that she was entitled to petition for a review of that decision within sixty days. She appealed, but the appeal was denied on October 1, 1998, because Aetna had not received a copy of her SSDI award letter. After October 1, 1998, Estades did not make any further efforts to obtain LTD. Estades has not contacted Associates regarding her availability or desire to return to work since her LTD was terminated in August 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Estades is currently undergoing psychiatric treatment and has not made any attempt to find another job because her psychiatrist has told her she is still unable to work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 5, 1998, Estades filed a complaint against defendants alleging that they violated the ADEA and the ADA, and raising supplemental law claims under Puerto Rico Law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants moved for summary judgment on all claims. The motion was referred to a magistrate judge, who recommended that the court grant the motion for summary judgment. Estades filed her objections to the report and recommendation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 30, 2002, the district court issued an opinion and order adopting the magistrate judge's report and recommendation and dismissing Estades's causes of action under the ADEA and the ADA. The district court dismissed the supplemental state law claims without prejudice because no federal claims to ground original jurisdiction remained before the court. Estades now appeals the district court's grant of summary judgment and dismissal of her state claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Analysis</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law based on the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions on file, and any affidavits. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, construing the record in the light most favorable to Estades, the non-movant. <i>Rosenberg,</i> 328 F.3d at 17. We may affirm the district court's decision on any grounds supported by the record. <i>Rodr&#237;guez v. Smithkline Beecham,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770098\"><a href=\"/opinion/770098/hilda-rodriguezplaintiffs-v-smithkline-beecham-their-agents-officers/\"><span class=\"volume\">224</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Age Discrimination Claim</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Estades argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on the ADEA claim because she presented direct evidence of age discrimination. In the alternative, Estades claims summary judgment should not have been granted with regard to the prima facie case because a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding whether she was actually or constructively discharged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ADEA makes it \"unlawful for an employer ... to discharge any individual ... because of such individual's age.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 623(a)(1). In an ADEA case, the plaintiff bears the burden of proving [s]he would not have been discharged \"but for [her] age.\" <i>Serrano-Cruz v. DFI P.R., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"738222\"><a href=\"/opinion/738222/digna-serrano-cruz-hector-irizarry-and-the-conjugal-society-comprised/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span>, 25 (1st Cir.1997). It goes without saying that a plaintiff's failure to present a triable question of material fact as to her having suffered an adverse employment action dooms an ADEA claim from the start. Under the circumstances of this case, we begin, therefore, by considering whether the record supports her claim to have suffered an adverse employment action at the hands of Associates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When she first became ill, Estades applied for and obtained short-term disability benefits under Associates' employee benefits policy. Before those benefits expired, Associates notified Estades that she could apply for long-term disability benefits and recommended that she apply for SSDI. The insurer, Prudential, at first denied her request for LTD, but notified her of the right to appeal which she exercised. As a matter of fact, Estades's employment with Associates was terminated as of February 28, 1997. Once Estades obtained a favorable appeal of her LTD denial on April 15, 1997, she was reinstated <i>retroactively</i> and <i>with benefits.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that this sequence of events does not contain a discharge actionable under the ADEA. Neither do Estades's subsequent difficulties with AETNA, ultimately resulting in the termination of her long-term disability benefits, establish that Associates discharged her. Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of Estades's ADEA claim, agreeing with the district court that she failed at the threshold to support the claim that she suffered an adverse employment action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Failure to Accommodate Claim</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Estades also claims that Associates violated the ADA by refusing to grant the accommodations she requested, namely reduction of her workload or provision of an assistant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The ADA prohibits discrimination against \"a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to ... terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12112(a). An employer violates the ADA if it \"knows of a disability yet fails to make reasonable accommodations.\" <i>Higgins v. New Balance Athletic Shoe, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198690\"><a href=\"/opinion/198690/higgins-v-new-balance/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">252</span></a></span>, 264 (1st Cir.1999). To survive summary judgment on her \"reasonable accommodation claim, [Estades] must produce enough evidence for a reasonable jury to find that (1)[s]he is disabled within the meaning of the ADA, (2)[s]he was able to perform the essential functions of the job with or without a reasonable accommodation, and (3) [Associates], despite knowing of [Estades]'s disability, did not reasonably accommodate it.\" <i>Rocafort v.

We focus our attention on the third prong: whether Associates knew of Estades's disability yet failed to accommodate her.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before she was diagnosed with depression, Estades requested a reduced workload or the aid of an assistant. Under the ADA, requests for accommodation must be express and must be linked to a disability. <i>See Cruz Carrillo v. AMR Eagle, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2567819\"><a href=\"/opinion/2567819/cruz-carrillo-v-amr-eagle-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">148</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Associates did not know Estades was disabled when she requested the accommodation &#8212; she had not yet been diagnosed with a disability at the time she sought a reduced workload or an assistant. Although Estades argues that her depression was evident when she requested the accommodation, the record does not support this claim. Finally, there is no evidence that the request was expressly repeated after Estades was diagnosed with a mental disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We uphold the grant of summary judgment on the ADA claim because Associates was unaware of Estades's disability when it denied her requested accommodation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>State Law Claims</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court acted \"well within its broad discretion\" in refusing to exercise supplemental jurisdiction and dismissing without prejudice the state law claims because no federal claims remained. <i>Lares Group, II v.
