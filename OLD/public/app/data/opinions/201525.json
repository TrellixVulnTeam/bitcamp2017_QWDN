MORIN, JR.,\n\n                     Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n         [Hon. Steven J. McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                      Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n                  Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                   and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n    Bjorn Lange, Assistant Federal Public Defender, for appellant.\n\n     Mark E. Howard, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nThomas P. Colantuono, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                         April 8, 2005\n\f           PER CURIAM. The defendant, Edward R. Morin, Jr., pleaded\n\nguilty to one count of distributing 190 mg of cocaine base under 21\n\nU.S.C. ยง 841(a)(1). Because of two prior felony convictions, Morin\n\nqualified as a career offender under USSG ยง 4B1.1.          The district\n\ncourt calculated a total offense level of 32, which, with Morin's\n\ncriminal history category of VI, yielded (after a three-level\n\ndownward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility) a sentencing\n\nrange of 151 to 188 months.\n\n             At sentencing, Morin protested that the amount of drugs\n\ninvolved in his offense was so trivial as to take his case out of\n\nthe heartland of typical career-offender cases, and he was thus\n\nentitled to a downward departure under 18 U.S.C. ยง 3553(b)(1) and\n\nUSSG ยง 5K2.0.      The district court was sympathetic to Morin's\n\nplight,   saying   that   it   would   depart   downward   if   it   could.\n\nUltimately, however, it concluded that it lacked the authority to\n\ndo so in Morin's case.         The court said, \"In my judgment the\n\nsmallness, if you will, of the drug quantity involved in the\n\noffense of conviction is not a basis for a downward departure in\n\nthis case.    If I'm wrong about that, if that does provide a legal\n\nbasis for a departure downward, I would have departed.\"         The court\n\nthen sentenced Morin to 151 months in prison, at the lowest end of\n\nthe available range.\n\n           This appeal followed.       After the Supreme Court decided\n\nUnited States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005), we asked for\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fsupplemental briefing on whether Morin should be resentenced in\n\nlight of that decision.       We now remand for resentencing.\n\n            Morin did not raise his claim of Booker error below, so\n\nwe review it for plain error. See United States v. Antonakopoulos,\n\n399 F.3d 68, 76 (1st Cir. 2005).         Morin must show (1) an error (2)\n\nthat was plain, (3) that affects substantial rights, and (4) that\n\nseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of\n\njudicial proceedings.        United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732\n\n(1993).    Here, the error was plain.        See Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d\n\nat 77.     In Antonakopoulos, we said that a situation like Morin's\n\nwould present a strong argument for remand:\n\n     [T]he mandatory nature of the Guidelines has produced\n     particular results which led trial judges to express that\n     the sentences imposed were unjust, grossly unfair, or\n     disproportionate to the crime committed, and the judges\n     would otherwise have sentenced differently. Where the\n     district judge has said as much about a Guidelines\n     sentence, that is a powerful argument for remand. If the\n     resulting sentence after remand is itself unreasonable,\n     the government can appeal.\n\nId. at 81 (citations omitted); see also United States v. MacKinnon,\n\n__ F.3d __, No. 03-2219, 2005 WL 605031 (1st Cir. Mar. 16, 2005)\n\n(remanding    under   like    circumstances).       The   district    court's\n\ncomments justify such a remand in this case.\n\n            Even if we do remand, the government has asked us \"to\n\nprovide an answer to the 'smallness' question so that re-sentencing\n\ncan be accomplished in a meaningful manner.\"                We decline that\n\nrequest.      Morin   could    raise    other   arguments   under    advisory\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fguidelines that were previously precluded.   The district court may\n\ndecide to reduce Morin's sentence based on other grounds, and may\n\nnot need to address the \"smallness\" question at all.       Prudence\n\ndictates that we refrain from answering questions that may have\n\nnothing to do with the ultimate resolution of this case.\n\n          Morin's sentence is VACATED; the case is REMANDED for\n\nresentencing.\n\n\n\n\n                               -4-\n\f",
