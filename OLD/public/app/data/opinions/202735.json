This is Frank Igwebuike Enwonwu's second\n\npetition for review of a determination by the Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals      (\"BIA\")      that   he   is     ineligible    for   relief   under       the\n\nConvention Against Torture (\"CAT\").1               In Enwonwu v. Gonzales, 438\n\nF.3d 22 (1st Cir. 2006) (\"Enwonwu I\"),2 we dismissed Enwonwu's\n\nconstitutional claims but remanded his claim for CAT relief to the\n\nBIA for \"further consideration . . . in light of its failure to\n\naddress the second ground in the IJ's decision,\" id. at 35, i.e.,\n\nthat Enwonwu would likely be tortured in retaliation for his\n\ncooperation with the Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") in\n\ntheir investigation of other Nigerian drug traffickers. On remand,\n\nthe BIA issued a new decision addressing the issue and finding\n\nEnwonwu ineligible for CAT relief on that ground.                  Enwonwu has now\n\nfiled a petition for review of the BIA's decision on remand,\n\nraising various procedural and substantive challenges to the BIA's\n\ndecision.          The    respondent    counters    those     challenges       and,   in\n\naddition, makes several threshold arguments.                     One such argument\n\nturns       on   the     scope   of   this    court's     jurisdiction    to    review\n\n\n     1\n      The Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or\nDegrading Treatment or Punishment, Dec. 10, 1984, 1465 U.N.T.S. 85,\nwas implemented in the United States by the Foreign Affairs Reform\nand Restructuring Act of 1998, Pub. L. No. 105-277, § 2242, 112\nStat. 2681-761 (codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1231 (note) (2000)).\n        2\n      The procedural history of this case prior to our decision in\nEnwonwu I is set forth in that decision, Enwonwu I, 438 F.3d at 24,\n25-28, as are the basic facts of this case as found by the\nImmigration Judge (\"IJ\"), id. at 25-26, and need not be repeated\nhere.\n\n                                             -2-\n\f\"questions of law\" in the wake of the Real ID Act.          See 8 U.S.C.\n\n1252(a)(2)(C)    &   (D).   Because     this   statutory   jurisdictional\n\nargument presents difficult and unsettled issues, we will by-pass\n\nit, see United States v. Ayala-Lopez, 457 F.3d 107, 108 (1st Cir.\n\n2006), and, for the reasons discussed below, deny the petition on\n\nother grounds.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          Before addressing Enwonwu's challenges to the BIA's\n\ndecision, we dispose of several of those challenges on other\n\nthreshold grounds identified by the respondent.\n\n                                 A.\n\n          First, we agree with the respondent that Enwonwu failed\n\nto exhaust his administrative remedies before the BIA with respect\n\nto two of the issues that Enwonwu raises here;         consequently, we\n\nwill not consider those issues.       See Boakai v. Gonzales, 447 F.3d\n\n1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 2005).      Those issues are (1) whether the case\n\nshould be remanded to the BIA for reconsideration of its rejection\n\nof the IJ's first rationale for finding it likely that Enwonwu\n\nwould be tortured if returned to Nigeria, i.e., that he would be\n\ndetained in a Nigerian prison because he had been convicted of a\n\ndrug offense in the United States,3 and (2) whether Enwonwu was\n\n\n     3\n      If Enwonwu had attempted to raise this issue before the BIA,\nthe Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") might well have argued\nthat the argument was outside the scope of this court's limited\nremand--i.e., \"for . . . further consideration of the CAT issue in\nlight of its failure to address the second ground in the IJ's\n\n                                  -3-\n\fobliged to \"provide evidence that he . . . would be singled out\n\nindividually\" for torture.4\n\n                                    B.\n\n            We also agree that another of Enwonwu's arguments is\n\nbarred by this court's decision in Enwonwu I.          The argument is that\n\nhis removal would impermissibly deprive him, retroactively, of his\n\n\"vested    rights\"   under   his   confidential     informant     agreement.\n\nAlthough    the   respondent   frames     this   bar   as   one   of   \"claim\n\npreclusion,\" it fits more comfortably into the doctrine of law of\n\nthe case.\n\n            Under the relevant branch of that doctrine, \"a legal\n\ndecision made at one stage of a civil or criminal proceeding . . .\n\nremain[s] the law of that case throughout the litigation, unless\n\nand until the decision is modified or overruled by a higher court.\n\nThat branch binds . . . a successor appellate panel in a second\n\nappeal in the same case . . . .\"        United States v. Moran, 393 F.3d\n\n1, 7 (1st Cir. 2004); see also Ellis v. United States, 313 F.3d\n\n636, 646-47 (1st Cir. 2002) (explaining the \"salutary policies\"\n\n\ndecision,\" Enwonwu I, 438 F.3d at 35 (emphasis added).            See United\nStates v. Bell, 988 F.2d 247, 250 (1st Cir. 1993).\n     4\n      After reviewing the administrative record, we conclude that\na third issue identified by the respondent--that the BIA should\nhave considered the district court's findings in that court's\nadvisory opinion in Enwonwu's habeas corpus case, Enwonwu v.\nChertoff, 376 F. Supp. 2d 42 (D. Mass. 2005)--was sufficiently\nraised before the BIA to satisfy the exhaustion requirement.\nHowever, for the reasons discussed later, we conclude that the BIA\nproperly declined to consider those findings.\n\n                                    -4-\n\fbehind this doctrine).        And it applies not only to issues actually\n\nraised and resolved in the first appeal but also to issues that\n\ncould have been raised in the first appeal but were not.                   United\n\nStates v. Ticchiarelli, 171 F.3d 24, 29 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n            It   makes   no   difference     whether   the    \"vested      rights\"\n\nargument that Enwonwu makes in his present petition is identical to\n\nor a variation on the substantive due process argument that was\n\nraised and rejected in Enwonwu I, 438 F.3d at 29-31.                 Either the\n\nargument was previously raised and rejected in his first petition,\n\nor it could have been raised there but was not.                Either way, the\n\nlaw   of   the   case   doctrine   precludes    Enwonwu      from   making   this\n\nargument in this second petition.\n\n                                       II.\n\n            We will discuss Enwonwu's remaining challenges to the\n\nBIA's decision on remand.\n\n                                       A.\n\n            In Enwonwu I, this court remanded Enwonwu's petition for\n\nreview of the denial of his CAT claim to the BIA to address the\n\nIJ's alternative finding that retribution would be sought against\n\nEnwonwu because of his cooperation with the DEA.                Enwonwu I, 438\n\nF.3d at 35.      On remand, the BIA provided the missing explanation.\n\nBut   in   its   resulting    order,   it    mistakenly   said      that   \"[t]he\n\nrespondent's [i.e., Enwonwu's] appeal is dismissed.\"                In fact, it\n\nwas the DHS (or its predecessor, the Immigration and Naturalization\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fService) that had appealed to the BIA from the IJ's decision in\n\nEnwonwu's favor, so the order should have said that the DHS's\n\nappeal is sustained, as did the BIA's original order.\n\n          In his brief to this court, Enwonwu points to that error\n\nas \"[t]he most glaring indicator of the continued arbitrary nature\n\nof the BIA's adjudication of this case on remand.\"   The error was\n\nnot substantive, since the body of the original decision clearly\n\nindicated that the BIA intended to rule in DHS's favor.   The BIA's\n\ninadvertent use of the opposite language hardly rises to the level\n\nof a constitutional due process violation, particularly given the\n\nabsence of any prejudice to Enwonwu and the BIA's prompt correction\n\nof its error.   See Ibe v. Gonzales, 415 F.3d 142, 144 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).\n\n                                 B.\n\n          Somewhat paradoxically, Enwonwu next claims that the\n\nBIA's correction of its order to say that the DHS appeal was\n\nsustained also constituted \"a serious violation of [his] due\n\nprocess rights.\"   As to how the correction was made, the record\n\nindicates only the following:   After Enwonwu pointed out the error\n\nin one of his many attempts to obtain a stay of removal pending\n\nappeal, the BIA amended its order, \"upon [its] own motion,\" to\n\nread, \"The DHS appeal is sustained.\"     The amended decision also\n\nadded--presumably in response to Enwonwu's further argument that\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fthere was no removal order in effect5--an explicit order that\n\n\"[t]he respondent is ordered removed from the United States to\n\nNigeria.\"      In   all   other   respects,   the   amended   decision\n\n\"incorporat[ed] by reference the text of the attached vacated\n\norder,\" i.e., the original decision.\n\n            According to Enwonwu, \"The only reasonable conclusion\n\nthat can be drawn [from that sequence of events] is that the BIA\n\nwas alerted to the error in its prior decision on an ex parte basis\n\nby the Government after the Petitioner filed his Petition for\n\nReview in this Court.\"      He claims that the inferred ex parte\n\ncontact violated his due process rights.\n\n            There are several problems with this due process claim,\n\nthe first of which is the absence of any concrete evidence in the\n\nrecord to rebut the BIA's own statement that the correction was\n\nmade \"upon the Board's own motion\" or the presumption of regularity\n\nthat attaches to the BIA's official acts.     McLeod v. INS, 802 F.2d\n\n89, 95 n.8 (3d Cir. 1986); see generally Giordano v. Fair, 697 F.2d\n\n14, 17 (1st Cir. 1983).      There is no evidence that the alleged\n\ncontact even occurred.    See United States v. Ames, 743 F.2d 46, 48\n\n(1st Cir. 1984).\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      In fact, the BIA's earlier decision, dated May 30, 2003,\nwhich was reviewed in Enwonwu I, already contained an order that\nEnwonwu be removed from the United States.        In addition, as\ndiscussed below, the IJ had ordered removal in the first instance.\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f           Second, even if such contact occurred, it would not\n\nnecessarily be impermissible.        Rather, under the Administrative\n\nProcedure Act, the only ex parte communications that are prohibited\n\nare those \"relevant to the merits of the proceeding.\"             5 U.S.C.\n\n§   557(d)(1)(A)   &   (B).   Any   ex    parte   communication   of   this\n\nessentially clerical error in the BIA's original decision was\n\nirrelevant to the merits of the BIA's decision, which remained the\n\nsame before and after the error was corrected.\n\n           Third, Enwonwu has not made the requisite showing that he\n\nwas prejudiced by communication of the error, which he himself had\n\nalready pointed out in a pleading of public record.        Absent such a\n\nshowing a prejudice, even an impermissible ex parte communication\n\ndoes not violate due process.       United States v. Nelson-Rodriguez,\n\n319 F.3d 12, 62 (1st Cir. 2003); In re Pearson, 990 F.2d 653, 661\n\n(1993).\n\n                                    C.\n\n           Next, Enwonwu argues that the BIA had no authority to\n\nenter a removal order \"in the first instance.\"6              The factual\n\npremise of that argument is mistaken since Enwonwu's removal order\n\nwas entered initially by the IJ, not the BIA.            Since Enwonwu's\n\n\n      6\n      Arguably, this argument is barred by the law of the case\ndoctrine, since the BIA's 2003 decision contained an identical\nremoval order, which Enwonwu could have but did not challenge in\nEnwonwu I. Ticchiarelli, 171 F.3d at 29. However, the respondent\ndid not raise this non-jurisdictional argument in his brief, so we\ndo not address it. Venegas-Hernandez v. Sonolux Records, 370 F.3d\n183, 188 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                                    -8-\n\fargument is based on this mistaken premise, we need not reach the\n\nissue of whether the BIA would have authority to issue a removal\n\norder where the IJ had not ordered removal, or at least made a\n\ndetermination of removability, in the first instance.\n\n                                    D.\n\n          Next, Enwonwu faults the BIA for declining to rely upon\n\nthe district court's factual findings in Enwonwu v. Chertoff.          As\n\nEnwonwu implicitly acknowledges by arguing that the BIA should have\n\ntaken administrative notice of those findings, absent taking such\n\nnotice, the BIA was powerless to adopt them.           See 8 C.F.R. §\n\n1003.1(d)(3)(iv)   (\"Except   for   taking   administrative   notice   of\n\ncommonly known facts such as current events or the contents of\n\nofficial documents, the Board will not engage in factfinding in the\n\ncourse of deciding appeals.\").\n\n          His arguments that the applicable regulations or due\n\nprocess required the BIA to take such notice are unavailing. First\n\nof all, we doubt that the district court's advisory opinion is an\n\n\"official document\" that the BIA is authorized to notice under 8\n\nC.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv) or that the facts found therein are the\n\nkinds of facts that may be noticed, see Gebremichael v. INS, 10\n\nF.3d 28, 37 & n.25 (1st Cir. 1993) (holding that BIA may take\n\nadministrative notice of \"legislative\" facts, i.e., \"those which\n\n'do not usually concern the immediate parties but are the general\n\nfacts which help the tribunal decide questions of law and policy\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fand discretion'\" as opposed to \"'adjudicative facts[,] [which]\n\nusually answer the questions of who did what, where, when, how,\n\nwhy, with what motive or intent'\").                 The BIA also appropriately\n\ndeclined to take notice, given the advisory nature of that opinion\n\nand the limited scope of this court's remand order, which directed\n\nthe BIA only to further explain its reasons for overturning the\n\nIJ's decision. Cf. Guzmán-Ruíz v. Hernández-Colón, 406 F.3d 31, 36\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                                           E.\n\n              Finally, Enwonwu paradoxically shifts from arguing that\n\nthe BIA should have considered the district court's findings to\n\narguing that the BIA was bound by the factual findings of the IJ\n\nbased on the record before him.            Consonant with the directive that\n\nthe   BIA    \"not    engage   in    de    novo   review   of   findings   of   fact\n\ndetermined by an immigration judge,\" 8 C.F.R. § 1103.1(d)(3)(i),\n\nthe BIA here expressly declined to engage in de novo review.\n\nInstead, the BIA reviewed the IJ's factual findings against the\n\nunderlying evidence only to determine whether those findings were\n\nclearly erroneous, as it was permitted to do.                    Id.   Finding no\n\n\"clear      error\"   in   the      IJ's   factual    findings,    including     his\n\ncredibility findings, the BIA \"accept[ed] the facts as stated by\n\nthe [IJ]\" but rejected the IJ's legal conclusion that, on those\n\nfacts, Enwonwu was eligible for CAT relief as a matter of law.\n\nEngaging in such de novo review of the IJ's legal conclusions was\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\fnot improper.   See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).   Those conclusions\n\nwere reasonable and were supported by substantial evidence.\n\n          In sum, all of Enwonwu's challenges to the BIA's decision\n\non remand are either procedurally barred or without merit or both.\n\nAccordingly, the petition is denied. See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.0(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\f",

One such argument\n\nturns       on   the     scope   of   this    court's     jurisdiction    to    review\n\n\n     1\n      The Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or\nDegrading Treatment or Punishment, Dec. 10, 1984, 1465 U.N.T.S. 85,\nwas implemented in the United States by the Foreign Affairs Reform\nand Restructuring Act of 1998, Pub.

See Boakai v.

Those issues are (1) whether the case\n\nshould be remanded to the BIA for reconsideration of its rejection\n\nof the IJ's first rationale for finding it likely that Enwonwu\n\nwould be tortured if returned to Nigeria, i.e., that he would be\n\ndetained in a Nigerian prison because he had been convicted of a\n\ndrug offense in the United States,3 and (2) whether Enwonwu was\n\n\n     3\n      If Enwonwu had attempted to raise this issue before the BIA,\nthe Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") might well have argued\nthat the argument was outside the scope of this court's limited\nremand--i.e., \"for . . . further consideration of the CAT issue in\nlight of its failure to address the second ground in the IJ's\n\n                                  -3-\n\fobliged to \"provide evidence that he . . . would be singled out\n\nindividually\" for torture.4\n\n                                    B.\n\n            We also agree that another of Enwonwu's arguments is\n\nbarred by this court's decision in Enwonwu I.          The argument is that\n\nhis removal would impermissibly deprive him, retroactively, of his\n\n\"vested    rights\"   under   his   confidential     informant     agreement.\n\nAlthough    the   respondent   frames     this   bar   as   one   of   \"claim\n\npreclusion,\" it fits more comfortably into the doctrine of law of\n\nthe case.\n\n            Under the relevant branch of that doctrine, \"a legal\n\ndecision made at one stage of a civil or criminal proceeding . . .\n\nremain[s] the law of that case throughout the litigation, unless\n\nand until the decision is modified or overruled by a higher court.\n\nThat branch binds . . . a successor appellate panel in a second\n\nappeal in the same case . . . .\"        United States v.

Either the\n\nargument was previously raised and rejected in his first petition,\n\nor it could have been raised there but was not.                Either way, the\n\nlaw   of   the   case   doctrine   precludes    Enwonwu      from   making   this\n\nargument in this second petition.\n\n                                       II.\n\n            We will discuss Enwonwu's remaining challenges to the\n\nBIA's decision on remand.\n\n                                       A.\n\n            In Enwonwu I, this court remanded Enwonwu's petition for\n\nreview of the denial of his CAT claim to the BIA to address the\n\nIJ's alternative finding that retribution would be sought against\n\nEnwonwu because of his cooperation with the DEA.                Enwonwu I, 438\n\nF.3d at 35.      On remand, the BIA provided the missing explanation.\n\nBut   in   its   resulting    order,   it    mistakenly   said      that   \"[t]he\n\nrespondent's [i.e., Enwonwu's] appeal is dismissed.\"                In fact, it\n\nwas the DHS (or its predecessor, the Immigration and Naturalization\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fService) that had appealed to the BIA from the IJ's decision in\n\nEnwonwu's favor, so the order should have said that the DHS's\n\nappeal is sustained, as did the BIA's original order.\n\n          In his brief to this court, Enwonwu points to that error\n\nas \"[t]he most glaring indicator of the continued arbitrary nature\n\nof the BIA's adjudication of this case on remand.\"   The error was\n\nnot substantive, since the body of the original decision clearly\n\nindicated that the BIA intended to rule in DHS's favor.   The BIA's\n\ninadvertent use of the opposite language hardly rises to the level\n\nof a constitutional due process violation, particularly given the\n\nabsence of any prejudice to Enwonwu and the BIA's prompt correction\n\nof its error.

Any   ex    parte   communication   of   this\n\nessentially clerical error in the BIA's original decision was\n\nirrelevant to the merits of the BIA's decision, which remained the\n\nsame before and after the error was corrected.\n\n           Third, Enwonwu has not made the requisite showing that he\n\nwas prejudiced by communication of the error, which he himself had\n\nalready pointed out in a pleading of public record.

Chertoff.          As\n\nEnwonwu implicitly acknowledges by arguing that the BIA should have\n\ntaken administrative notice of those findings, absent taking such\n\nnotice, the BIA was powerless to adopt them.           See 8 C.F.R. §\n\n1003.1(d)(3)(iv)   (\"Except   for   taking   administrative   notice   of\n\ncommonly known facts such as current events or the contents of\n\nofficial documents, the Board will not engage in factfinding in the\n\ncourse of deciding appeals.\").\n\n          His arguments that the applicable regulations or due\n\nprocess required the BIA to take such notice are unavailing. First\n\nof all, we doubt that the district court's advisory opinion is an\n\n\"official document\" that the BIA is authorized to notice under 8\n\nC.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv) or that the facts found therein are the\n\nkinds of facts that may be noticed, see Gebremichael v.

Consonant with the directive that\n\nthe   BIA    \"not    engage   in    de    novo   review   of   findings   of   fact\n\ndetermined by an immigration judge,\" 8 C.F.R. § 1103.1(d)(3)(i),\n\nthe BIA here expressly declined to engage in de novo review.\n\nInstead, the BIA reviewed the IJ's factual findings against the\n\nunderlying evidence only to determine whether those findings were\n\nclearly erroneous, as it was permitted to do.                    Id.   Finding no\n\n\"clear      error\"   in   the      IJ's   factual    findings,    including     his\n\ncredibility findings, the BIA \"accept[ed] the facts as stated by\n\nthe [IJ]\" but rejected the IJ's legal conclusion that, on those\n\nfacts, Enwonwu was eligible for CAT relief as a matter of law.\n\nEngaging in such de novo review of the IJ's legal conclusions was\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\fnot improper.   See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).   Those conclusions\n\nwere reasonable and were supported by substantial evidence.\n\n          In sum, all of Enwonwu's challenges to the BIA's decision\n\non remand are either procedurally barred or without merit or both.\n\nAccordingly, the petition is denied.
