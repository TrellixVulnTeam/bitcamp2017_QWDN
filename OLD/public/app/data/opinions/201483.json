OAKES,\n                      Petitioner, Appellant,\n\n                                v.\n\n                    UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\n                      Respondent, Appellee.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF MAINE\n\n\n         [Hon. Gene Carter, Senior U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n                   Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                    and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     James H. Feldman, Jr., with whom Alan Ellis, Peter Goldberger,\nand Law Offices of Alan Ellis were on brief, for appellant.\n     F. Mark Terison, Assistant United States Attorney (Senior\nLitigation Counsel), with whom Paula D. Silsby, United States\nAttorney, was on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          March 16, 2005\n\f          SELYA, Circuit Judge.            Petitioner-appellant David J.\n\nOakes, a person incarcerated by reason of a previous conviction on\n\nfederal child pornography charges, appeals from the dismissal of\n\nhis petition to vacate his conviction and sentence.                 The district\n\ncourt based its decision on procedural default even though the\n\ngovernment had failed to raise that defense in its response to\n\nOakes's petition.     In a challenge that frames a question of first\n\nimpression in this circuit, Oakes now posits, inter alia, that the\n\ndistrict court lacked the authority to interject the question of\n\nprocedural default into the case sua sponte.            Although we reject\n\nthat premise, we nonetheless vacate the judgment below because the\n\ncourt failed to give Oakes either notice of its intention to\n\nconsider the previously unraised issue or an opportunity to be\n\nheard on that issue before dismissing his petition.\n\n          We briefly rehearse the background.               In July of 2000,\n\npolice   officers     executed   a    search      warrant     and     discovered\n\napproximately    45,000     images   of    what    appeared     to    be   child\n\npornography in Oakes's computer files.            The next month, a federal\n\ngrand jury charged him with one count of knowingly receiving child\n\npornography     and   one   count    of     knowingly       possessing     child\n\npornography.     See 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(2)(A) & (5)(B).                  Oakes\n\neventually entered a guilty plea to the first of these counts and,\n\non July 19, 2001, the district court sentenced him to a 54-month\n\nincarcerative term.\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f          Oakes     appealed    solely    on   sentence-related   grounds.\n\nDuring the pendency of that appeal, the Supreme Court decided\n\nAshcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. 234 (2002).                That\n\ndecision held unconstitutional under the First Amendment the Child\n\nPornography Prevention Act of 1996 (CPPA), insofar as it prohibited\n\nvirtual pornographic images (i.e., images that were created without\n\nusing actual children).        See id. at 251-56.     The CPPA encompassed\n\nthe statute of conviction in Oakes's case and, six days after the\n\ndecision in Free Speech Coalition, Oakes filed in the district\n\ncourt a pro se petition to vacate his conviction and sentence\n\npursuant to the federal habeas statute, 28 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\n          On April 26, 2002, Oakes filed a supporting memorandum\n\nthat crystallized his argument.           In it, he asserted that his\n\nconviction and sentence should be vacated because his guilty plea\n\nhad been neither knowing nor voluntary. He based this assertion on\n\na claim that he did not understand, at the time he pleaded guilty,\n\nthat the government would have to prove that the images in his\n\npossession depicted actual children.           Anticipating what seemed a\n\nlikely government rejoinder, he also argued that his failure to\n\nchallenge his guilty plea on direct appeal should be excused as the\n\npossibility    of     mounting       a    challenge      based    on    the\n\nunconstitutionality of the CPPA was not knowable at the time of\n\nthat appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f            The   district   court   referred   Oakes's   petition   to   a\n\nmagistrate judge, see Fed R. Civ. P. 72(b), who recommended that it\n\nbe dismissed without prejudice due to the pendency of Oakes's\n\ndirect appeal.     See, e.g., United States v. Gordon, 634 F.2d 638,\n\n638 (1st Cir. 1980) (holding that \"the orderly administration of\n\ncriminal justice precludes a district court from considering a §\n\n2255 motion while review of the direct appeal is still pending\")\n\n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted).         Oakes objected,\n\nthus bringing the matter before the district court for de novo\n\nreview.     See Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b).     The court sensibly appointed\n\ncounsel for Oakes and directed the government to reply to the\n\npetition.    In its reply, the government did not raise a defense of\n\nprocedural default; it argued only that Free Speech Coalition was\n\ninapposite to Oakes's case.\n\n            On October 4, 2002, this court rejected the petitioner's\n\ndirect appeal, see United States v. Oakes, 47 Fed. Appx. 5, 6 (1st\n\nCir. 2002) (per curiam), thus removing the sequencing obstacle that\n\nhad concerned the magistrate judge.             A few weeks later, the\n\ndistrict court took up the habeas petition, raised sua sponte the\n\nquestion of procedural default, and denied relief on that basis.\n\nUnited States v. Oakes, 224 F. Supp. 2d 296, 298 (D. Me. 2002).           In\n\nthe course of its ruling, the court discussed and discarded two\n\npossible avenues for avoiding the usual consequences of procedural\n\ndefault, namely, (i) cause and prejudice (including the argument\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fpreemptively raised in the petition),1 and (ii) actual innocence.\n\nId. at 300-02.        Oakes was not afforded an opportunity to address\n\neither avenue.\n\n            Oakes unsuccessfully sought to have the district court\n\nissue a certificate of appealability.            See 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(1);\n\n1st Cir. R. 22(b)(1).         He then repaired to this court in search of\n\nsuch a certificate.         We obliged, limiting review to \"[w]hether the\n\ndistrict court [had] erred in denying petitioner's 28 U.S.C. § 2255\n\nmotion on the ground of procedural default.\"               This timely appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n            It   is     a    bedrock    principle    that,      under    ordinary\n\ncircumstances, the voluntariness of a guilty plea can be questioned\n\non collateral review under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 only if, and to the\n\nextent that,     the    plea    has    been   challenged   on   direct   appeal.\n\nBousley v. United States, 523 U.S. 614, 621 (1998).                If a federal\n\nhabeas petitioner challenges his conviction or sentence on a ground\n\nthat he did not advance on direct appeal, his claim is deemed\n\nprocedurally defaulted.         Id.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      To this end, the district court noted that, at the time of\nthe petitioner's sentencing, the First Amendment argument that the\nSupreme Court would later accept in Free Speech Coalition already\nhad been made and rejected in this circuit.      See Oakes, 224 F.\nSupp. 2d at 300-01 (citing United States v. Hilton, 167 F.3d 61, 73\n(1st Cir. 1999)). Thus, such an argument was available — and the\nfact that it may have seemed futile did not excuse the default.\nId. at 301.\n\n                                        -5-\n\f            A procedural default is not necessarily a total bar to\n\nfederal habeas relief.           Notwithstanding such a default, a federal\n\nhabeas petition will be allowed to go forward if the petitioner can\n\nshow either (i) that there is cause for the default and actual\n\nprejudice resulting from it, or (ii) that he is actually innocent\n\nof the offense of conviction.          See id. at 622-23; Derman v. United\n\nStates, 298 F.3d 34, 45 (1st Cir. 2002).              Before us, the petitioner\n\ndoes not dispute the default, but, rather, challenges both the\n\ndistrict court's ability to invoke the doctrine of procedural\n\ndefault sua sponte and the court's treatment of the two avenues\n\nthat have the potential to offset his procedural default.\n\n            Oakes's first assignment of error has several dimensions.\n\nHe begins with the proposition that procedural default is an\n\naffirmative defense and that, therefore, the government may lose\n\nthe defense by neglecting to raise it in a response to a habeas\n\npetition.     That is a correct statement of the law.                     See, e.g.,\n\nHoward v. United States, 374 F.3d 1068, 1073 (11th Cir. 2004); Doe\n\nv. United States, 51 F.3d 693, 698-99 (7th Cir. 1995); cf. Trest v.\n\nCain, 522 U.S. 87, 89 (1997) (holding, under 28 U.S.C. § 2254, that\n\n\"procedural    default      is   normally    a     defense   that   the    State   is\n\nobligated     to   raise\"    (citation       and    internal    quotation      marks\n\nomitted)).     Building on this foundation, Oakes urges us to find\n\nthat allowing the district court to \"choose sides\" by spontaneously\n\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fcuring the government's omission would undermine the adversarial\n\nsystem.\n\n           This exhortation presents a question of first impression\n\nin this circuit.   There are, however, straws in the wind.           In the\n\nrelated context of habeas appeals from state convictions under 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2254, we have sanctioned the practice of district courts\n\nraising issues of procedural default sua sponte. See, e.g., Brewer\n\nv. Marshall, 119 F.3d 993, 999 (1st Cir. 1997).         Other courts of\n\nappeals have agreed that a district court has discretion to raise\n\nthe issue of procedural default sua sponte in the section 2254\n\nmilieu.    See, e.g., Sweger v. Chesney, 294 F.3d 506, 520-21 (3d\n\nCir. 2002); Yeatts v. Angelone, 166 F.3d 255, 261 (4th Cir. 1999);\n\nBurgin v. Broglin, 900 F.2d 990, 997-98 (7th Cir. 1990).\n\n           Oakes labors to distinguish between the two contexts by\n\npointing   out   that,    in   permitting   district   courts   to    raise\n\nprocedural default sua sponte in section 2254 cases, courts have\n\ncommented that doing so assuages federal-state comity concerns.\n\nSee, e.g., Sweger, 294 F.3d at 521; Yeatts, 166 F.3d at 261; Ortiz\n\nv. Dubois, 19 F.3d 708, 714-15 (1st Cir. 1994).          In that sense,\n\nsection 2254 offers more fertile soil for sua sponte recognition of\n\nprocedural default.      Even so, the section 2254 cases furnish some\n\nsupport for allowing district courts, in section 2255 cases, to\n\nraise issues of procedural default sua sponte. We explain briefly.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\f           In regard to section 2254, courts also have noted that\n\nallowing sua sponte recognition of procedural defaults serves a\n\nsecond interest:      the federal courts' interest in husbanding, and\n\nefficiently allocating, scarce judicial resources. See Sweger, 294\n\nF.3d at 521; Yeatts, 166 F.3d at 261; Ortiz, 19 F.3d at 715; see\n\nalso Hardiman v. Reynolds, 971 F.2d 500, 502-03 (10th Cir. 1992).\n\nThat interest is equally compelling in section 2255 cases. And the\n\npraxis, in both sets of cases, implicates the federal courts'\n\ninterest in finality.      Cf. Andiarena v. United States, 967 F.2d\n\n715, 717 (1st Cir. 1992) (per curiam) (rejecting any distinction\n\nbetween section 2254 and section 2255 in \"abuse of the writ\" cases\n\nand noting that while section 2254 abuse of the writ jurisprudence\n\nhas its roots in comity and federalism, \"the central concern\n\nunderlying [that jurisprudence] — the importance of promoting\n\nfinality   in   the   criminal   arena   —   is   not   confined   to   state\n\nprisoners\").    That is a matter of great import because \"[i]nroads\n\non the concept of finality tend to undermine confidence in the\n\nintegrity of our procedures.\"       Hines v. United States, 971 F.2d\n\n506, 508 (10th Cir. 1992) (quoting United States v. Addonizio, 442\n\nU.S. 178, 184 n.11 (1979)).        We previously have recognized the\n\nstrong interest in finality served by section 2255's procedural\n\ndefault rule.   See Prou v. United States, 199 F.3d 37, 47 (1st Cir.\n\n1999); United States v. Barrett, 178 F.3d 34, 38 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\nThat interest is heightened in the circumstances of this case. See\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fBousley, 523 U.S. at 621 (noting that the \"concern with finality\n\nserved by the limitation on collateral attack has special force\n\nwith respect to convictions based on guilty pleas\") (quoting United\n\nStates v. Timmreck, 441 U.S. 780, 784 (1979)).\n\n             We add, moreover, that the articulation of the procedural\n\ndefault rule in state habeas cases under section 2254 is similar to\n\nthat   in    federal   habeas   cases   under   section    2255.   In   both\n\ninstances, the rule holds that if a person in custody has cut\n\nhimself off from otherwise-available remedies on a particular\n\nmatter due to his own procedural default, that default constitutes\n\nan independent and adequate ground sufficient to foreclose federal\n\nhabeas review of the alleged error.        Ortiz, 19 F.3d at 714 (citing\n\nWainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, 87 (1977)); accord Derman, 298\n\nF.3d at 44 & n.5 (noting that the Supreme Court has extended\n\nWainwright's      \"general   rule   that   a    criminal    defendant   must\n\nseasonably advance an objection to a potential constitutional\n\ninfirmity in order to preserve the point for collateral attack\" to\n\nthe section 2255 context) (citing Bousley, 523 U.S. at 622); see\n\ngenerally 3 Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice and\n\nProcedure § 596.1 (3d ed. 2004); 17A id. §§ 4266-4266.1 (2d ed.\n\n1988).      So viewed, the rule has the salutary effect of preventing\n\ncriminal defendants from using collateral review as a painless\n\nsurrogate for direct appellate review.          See Bousley, 523 U.S. at\n\n621 (discussing procedural default in the section 2255 context);\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fReed v. Farley, 512 U.S. 339, 354 (1994) (discussing procedural\n\ndefault in the section 2254 context).\n\n               To sum up, judicial economy and finality, like comity,\n\nare institutional values that transcend the litigants' parochial\n\ninterests.          Where such values are in play, the court should have\n\nsome say in deciding whether a defense should be considered or\n\ndeemed waived.            Cf. Hardiman, 971 F.2d at 503 (\"Unless the state\n\nprocedural bar defense can be raised sua sponte, a state that fails\n\nto raise that defense can effectively force a federal court to\n\nreview the merits of a case that may be simpler to decide on\n\nprocedural grounds.\").                Preventing the facile use of a habeas\n\npetition       as    a    substitute     for    a    direct   appeal   can    best    be\n\naccomplished if district courts have the discretion to enforce the\n\nprocedural default rule even though the government (federal or\n\nstate) turns a blind eye.               Consequently, we hold that a district\n\ncourt    has    the       discretion,    in    a    section   2255   case,   to     raise\n\nquestions       of       procedural    default      sua   sponte,    even    when    the\n\ngovernment has filed a reply and eschewed any reference to that\n\ndefense.2      This holding is consistent with the position adopted by\n\nthe two other courts of appeals that have addressed this matter to\n\ndate.    See United States v. Willis, 273 F.3d 592, 596-97 (5th Cir.\n\n\n     2\n      We emphasize that this authority is discretionary and that a\ndistrict court, if it so elects, may choose to hold the government\nto its waiver. See Hines, 971 F.2d at 509; cf. Trest, 522 U.S. at\n89 (noting, in a section 2254 case, that a \"court of appeals is not\nrequired to raise the issue of procedural default sua sponte\").\n\n                                          -10-\n\f2001); Hines, 971 F.2d at 508-09; cf. Femia v. United States, 47\n\nF.3d 519, 523 (2d Cir. 1995) (relying on the interests of judicial\n\neconomy and finality in allowing district court to dismiss section\n\n2255 petition sua sponte on the procedural ground of abuse of the\n\nwrit); United States v. Fallon, 992 F.2d 212, 213 (8th Cir. 1993)\n\n(same).\n\n           This holding does not end our inquiry.           Oakes argues\n\npersuasively that he should not have been required to be prescient.\n\nHe says that he had no duty to anticipate potential affirmative\n\ndefenses, but, rather, was entitled to wait and address such\n\ndefenses when and if they were raised.        Thus, even if the district\n\ncourt acted within the realm of its discretion in bringing up the\n\nissue of procedural default sua sponte — and we have held that it\n\ndid — he (Oakes) should have been given notice of the court's\n\nintention and afforded an opportunity to respond.\n\n           We think that this position is well-taken.       The ubiquity\n\nof the \"notice and opportunity to be heard\" principle as a matter\n\nof fundamental fairness is deeply engrained in our jurisprudence.\n\nSee Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 542 (1985)\n\n(stating that notice and an opportunity to be heard together\n\ncomprise   an   \"essential   principle   of   due   process\");   Earle   v.\n\nMcVeigh, 91 U.S. 503, 504 (1875) (citing the \"well-known legal\n\nmaxim, that no one shall be condemned in his person or property\n\nwithout notice, and an opportunity to be heard in his defence\").\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fThat this principle applies in the context of the procedural\n\ndefault defense cannot be gainsaid. See, e.g., Willis, 273 F.3d at\n\n597; Boyd v. Thompson, 147 F.3d 1124, 1128 (9th Cir. 1998); Hines,\n\n971 F.2d at 509; Hardiman, 971 F.2d at 505.                 This is as it should\n\nbe; procedural default is an affirmative defense, and a plaintiff\n\ngenerally is not required to negate an affirmative defense unless\n\nand until the defendant has placed it in issue.                 See, e.g., Gomez\n\nv.   Toledo,     446   U.S.    635,    640    (1980);   Tregenza     v.   Great   Am.\n\nCommunications Co., 12 F.3d 717, 718 (7th Cir. 1993).                     That rule\n\napplies foursquare in habeas cases — and particularly so in cases\n\ninvolving pro se petitioners. See, e.g., Hill v. Braxton, 277 F.3d\n\n701, 706 (4th Cir. 2002).\n\n            In    this   instance,       the    district     court   directed     the\n\ngovernment to reply to the petition.                   Its response omitted any\n\nmention of       procedural        default.     At   that   juncture,     Oakes   was\n\nentitled to assume that the defense was by the boards and the fact\n\nthat he had preemptively addressed the defense in his original pro\n\nse petition does not alter this entitlement.                  For one thing, once\n\nthe government chose to eschew the defense despite the petition's\n\nexplicit reference to it, Oakes had even more cause than usual to\n\nassume that the issue was out of the case.                  Cf. Lewis v. Sternes,\n\n390 F.3d 1019, 1029 (7th Cir. 2004) (noting that government's\n\nspecific failure to raise procedural default after it has been\n\nmentioned      elsewhere      in    pleadings    may    raise   an   inference     of\n\n\n                                         -12-\n\fintentional    waiver).         For    another     thing,    the     petitioner's\n\npreemptive thrust did not exhaust the compendium of his possible\n\nanswers to a procedural default defense.                Had he been made aware\n\nthat the issue was live, he could have mustered all of his\n\narguments in response.       Cf. Bousley, 523 U.S. at 623 (finding it\n\n\"appropriate\" to permit a habeas petitioner to raise an actual\n\ninnocence claim for the first time on remand even though he had not\n\nraised the claim in his initial petition).\n\n            To be sure, despite the government's nonchalance the\n\ndistrict court lawfully exercised its discretion in choosing to\n\nresurrect the procedural default issue.              At that point, however,\n\nthe court should have given the petitioner notice of its intention\n\nand afforded him an opportunity to respond before dismissing the\n\npetition.     See Lugo v. Keane, 15 F.3d 29, 30 (2d Cir. 1994) (per\n\ncuriam) (\"No     principle      is    more   fundamental     to   our    system    of\n\njudicial administration than that a person is entitled to notice\n\nbefore   adverse    judicial     action      is   taken   against    him.\");       cf.\n\nBerkovitz v. Home Box Office, Inc., 89 F.3d 24, 29 (1st Cir. 1996)\n\n(enforcing,    in   the   sua    sponte       summary     judgment      context,    a\n\nrequirement of notice and an opportunity to be heard).\n\n            In some circumstances, such an error might be harmless.\n\nThat would be true if, say, a petitioner admittedly could not\n\ndemonstrate either cause and prejudice or actual innocence.                        Cf.\n\nLattab v. Ashcroft, 384 F.3d 8, 20-21 & n.6 (1st Cir. 2004) (noting\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\fthat claim of lack of due process need not be adjudicated when, in\n\nall events, petitioner's admissions conclusively showed a lack of\n\nany prejudice).    But this is not such a case.          We explain briefly.\n\n           While Oakes does not challenge the district court's\n\nholding that the supposed \"unavailability\" of a First Amendment\n\ndefense does not constitute cause for his procedural default, see\n\nsupra note 1, he does advance two other theories on which the\n\ndefault might be excused.        First, he proffers a claim of actual\n\ninnocence.3    Although the district court did state that it believed\n\nOakes would not be able to successfully raise such a claim, Oakes,\n\n224 F. Supp. 2d at 302 n.8, it hardly can fault the petitioner for\n\nfailing to flesh out a winning \"actual innocence\" argument when it\n\ndeprived   him   both   of   notice   that   such   an   argument    would   be\n\nnecessary and of an opportunity to develop it.\n\n           The   petitioner    also    insinuates   that    he    has   another\n\npossible ground for cause:      ineffective assistance of counsel.           In\n\nthis regard, he notes that the Supreme Court decided Free Speech\n\nCoalition while briefing was still ongoing in his direct appeal.\n\nBuilding on this foundation, he suggests that counsel's failure to\n\nraise    the   First    Amendment     argument   during    that     proceeding\n\n\n     3\n      We note that the district court found that Oakes failed to\nraise actual innocence in his pro se petition. Oakes, 224 F. Supp.\n2d at 302. Whether or not he raised the point is hotly contested\nbut, in the last analysis, is beside the point. After all, Oakes\nwas not under an obligation to meet a charge of procedural default\nunless and until such a charge was levied (either by the government\nor by the district court).\n\n                                      -14-\n\fconstituted      substandard   performance    that      redounded     to   his\n\ndetriment.       Ineffective assistance of counsel, if proved, would\n\nconstitute cause for excusing the procedural default.               Murray v.\n\nCarrier, 477 U.S. 478, 488 (1986); Prou, 199 F.3d at 47.             Here too,\n\nhowever, Oakes was not given notice and a fair chance to make that\n\ncase.\n\n           We need go no further. Because the lower court failed to\n\nafford Oakes either notice of its intention to rely upon his\n\nprocedural default or an opportunity to respond to that issue, we\n\nmust    vacate    the   judgment   and   remand   the   case   for    further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion. In that respect, we hold\n\nonly that Oakes should have a fair opportunity to show why his\n\npetition is not barred by procedural default.             We take no view\n\neither of his claim of actual innocence or of his claim of\n\nineffective assistance of counsel.\n\n\n\n             Vacated and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\f",

Oakes, a person incarcerated by reason of a previous conviction on federal child pornography charges, appeals from the dismissal of his petition to vacate his conviction and sentence. The district court based its decision on procedural default even though the government had failed to raise that defense in its response to Oakes's petition. In a challenge that frames a question of first impression in this circuit, Oakes now posits, inter alia, that the district court lacked the authority to interject the question of procedural default into the case sua sponte. Although we reject that premise, we nonetheless vacate the judgment below because the court failed to give Oakes either notice of its intention to consider the previously unraised issue or an opportunity to be heard on that issue before dismissing his petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We briefly rehearse the background. In July of 2000, police officers executed a search warrant and discovered approximately 45,000 images of what appeared to be child pornography in Oakes's computer files. The next month, a federal grand jury charged him with one count of knowingly receiving child pornography and one count of knowingly possessing child pornography. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2252A(a)(2)(A) &amp; (5)(B). Oakes eventually entered a guilty plea to the first of these counts and, on July 19, 2001, the district court sentenced him to a 54-month incarcerative term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Oakes appealed solely on sentence-related grounds. During the pendency of that appeal, the Supreme Court decided <i>Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition,</i> 535 U.S. 234, 122 S.Ct. 1389, 152 L.Ed.2d 403 (2002). That decision held unconstitutional under the First Amendment the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996 (CPPA), insofar as it prohibited virtual pornographic images (i.e., images that were created without using actual children). <i>See id.</i> at 251-56, 122 S.Ct. 1389. The CPPA encompassed the statute of conviction in Oakes's case and, six days after the decision in <i>Free Speech Coalition,</i> Oakes filed in the district court a pro se petition to vacate his conviction and sentence pursuant to the federal habeas statute, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 26, 2002, Oakes filed a supporting memorandum that crystallized his argument. In it, he asserted that his conviction and sentence should be vacated because his guilty plea had been neither knowing nor voluntary. He based this assertion on a claim that he did not understand, at the time he pleaded guilty, that the government would have to prove that the images in his possession depicted actual children. Anticipating what seemed a likely government rejoinder, he also argued that his failure to challenge his guilty plea on direct appeal should be excused as the possibility of mounting a challenge based on the unconstitutionality of the CPPA was not knowable at the time of that appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court referred Oakes's petition to a magistrate judge, <i>see</i> Fed R. Civ. P. 72(b), who recommended that it be dismissed without prejudice due to the pendency of Oakes's direct appeal. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Gordon,</i> 634 F.2d 638, 638 (1st Cir.1980) (holding that \"the orderly administration of criminal justice precludes a district court from considering a &#167; 2255 motion while review of the direct appeal is still pending\") (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Oakes objected, thus bringing the matter before the district court for de novo review. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(b). The court sensibly appointed counsel for Oakes and directed the government to reply to the petition. In its reply, the government did not raise a defense of procedural default; it argued only that <i>Free Speech Coalition</i> was inapposite to Oakes's case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 4, 2002, this court rejected the petitioner's direct appeal, <i>see United States v. Oakes,</i> 47 Fed.Appx. 5, 6 (1st Cir.2002) (per curiam), thus removing the sequencing obstacle that had concerned the magistrate judge. A few weeks later, the district court took up the habeas petition, raised sua sponte the question of procedural default, and denied relief on that basis. <i>United States v. Oakes,</i> 224 F.Supp.2d 296, 298 (D.Me.2002). In the course of its ruling, the court discussed and discarded two possible avenues for avoiding the usual consequences of procedural default, namely, (i) cause and prejudice (including the argument preemptively raised in the petition),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and (ii) actual innocence. <i>Id.</i> at 300-02. Oakes was not afforded an opportunity to address either avenue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Oakes unsuccessfully sought to have the district court issue a certificate of appealability. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253(c)(1); 1st Cir. R. 22(b)(1). He then repaired to this court in search of such a certificate. We obliged, limiting review to \"[w]hether the district court [had] erred in denying petitioner's 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 motion on the ground of procedural default.\" This timely appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is a bedrock principle that, under ordinary circumstances, the voluntariness of a guilty plea can be questioned on collateral review under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 only if, and to the extent that, the plea has been challenged on direct appeal. <i>Bousley v. United States,</i> 523 U.S. 614, 621, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998). If a federal habeas petitioner challenges his conviction or sentence on a ground that he did not advance on direct appeal, his claim is deemed procedurally defaulted. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A procedural default is not necessarily a total bar to federal habeas relief. Notwithstanding such a default, a federal habeas petition will be allowed to go forward if the petitioner can show either (i) that there is cause for the default and actual prejudice resulting from it, or (ii) that he is actually innocent of the offense of conviction. <i>See id.</i> at 622-23, 118 S.Ct. 1604; <i>Derman v. United States,</i> 298 F.3d 34, 45 (1st Cir.2002). Before us, the petitioner does not dispute the default, but, rather, challenges both the district court's ability to invoke the doctrine of procedural default sua sponte and the court's treatment of the two avenues that have the potential to offset his procedural default.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Oakes's first assignment of error has several dimensions. He begins with the proposition that procedural default is an affirmative defense and that, therefore, the government may lose the defense by neglecting to raise it in a response to a habeas petition. That is a correct statement of the law. <i>See, e.g., Howard v. United States,</i> 374 F.3d 1068, 1073 (11th Cir.2004); <i>Doe v. United States,</i> 51 F.3d 693, 698-99 (7th Cir.1995); <i>cf. Trest v. Cain,</i> 522 U.S. 87, 89, 118 S.Ct. 478, 139 L.Ed.2d 444 (1997) (holding, under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254, that \"procedural default is normally a defense that the State is obligated to raise\" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). Building on this foundation, Oakes urges us to find that allowing the district court to \"choose sides\" by spontaneously curing the government's omission would undermine the adversarial system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This exhortation presents a question of first impression in this circuit. There are, however, straws in the wind. In the related context of habeas appeals from state convictions under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254, we have sanctioned the practice of district courts raising issues of procedural default sua sponte. <i>See, e.g., Brewer v. Marshall,</i> 119 F.3d 993, 999 (1st Cir.1997). Other courts of appeals have agreed that a district court has discretion to raise the issue of procedural default sua sponte in the section 2254 milieu. <i>See, e.g., Sweger v. Chesney,</i> 294 F.3d 506, 520-21 (3d Cir.2002); <i>Yeatts v. Angelone,</i> 166 F.3d 255, 261 (4th Cir.1999); <i>Burgin v. Broglin,</i> 900 F.2d 990, 997-98 (7th Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Oakes labors to distinguish between the two contexts by pointing out that, in permitting district courts to raise procedural default sua sponte in section 2254 cases, courts have commented that doing so assuages federal-state comity concerns. <i>See, e.g., Sweger,</i> 294 F.3d at 521; <i>Yeatts,</i> 166 F.3d at 261; <i>Ortiz v. Dubois,</i> 19 F.3d 708, 714-15 (1st Cir.1994). In that sense, section 2254 offers more fertile soil for sua sponte recognition of procedural default. Even so, the section 2254 cases furnish some support for allowing district courts, in section 2255 cases, to raise issues of procedural default sua sponte. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In regard to section 2254, courts also have noted that allowing sua sponte recognition of procedural defaults serves a second interest: the federal courts' interest in husbanding, and efficiently allocating, scarce judicial resources. <i>See Sweger,</i> 294 F.3d at 521; <i>Yeatts,</i> 166 F.3d at 261; <i>Ortiz,</i> 19 F.3d at 715; <i>see also Hardiman v. Reynolds,</i> 971 F.2d 500, 502-03 (10th Cir.1992). That interest is equally compelling in section 2255 cases. And the praxis, in both sets of cases, implicates the federal courts' interest in finality. <i>Cf. Andiarena v. United States,</i> 967 F.2d 715, 717 (1st Cir.1992) (per curiam) (rejecting any distinction between section 2254 and section 2255 in \"abuse of the writ\" cases and noting that while section 2254 abuse of the writ jurisprudence has its roots in comity and federalism, \"the central concern underlying [that jurisprudence] &#8212; the importance of promoting finality in the criminal arena &#8212; is not confined to state prisoners\"). That is a matter of great import because \"[i]nroads on the concept of finality tend to undermine confidence in the integrity of our procedures.\" <i>Hines v. United States,</i> 971 F.2d 506, 508 (10th Cir.1992) (quoting <i>United States v. Addonizio,</i> 442 U.S. 178, 184 n. 11, 99 S.Ct. 2235, 60 L.Ed.2d 805 (1979)). We previously have recognized the strong interest in finality served by section 2255's procedural default rule. <i>See Prou v. United States,</i> 199 F.3d 37, 47 (1st Cir.1999); <i>United States v. Barrett,</i> 178 F.3d 34, 38 (1st Cir.1999). That interest is heightened in the circumstances of this case. <i>See Bousley,</i> 523 U.S. at 621, 118 S.Ct. 1604 (noting that the \"concern with finality served by the limitation on collateral attack has special force with respect to convictions based on guilty pleas\") (quoting <i>United States v. Timmreck,</i> 441 U.S. 780, 784, 99 S.Ct. 2085, 60 L.Ed.2d 634 (1979)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add, moreover, that the articulation of the procedural default rule in state habeas cases under section 2254 is similar to that in federal habeas cases under section 2255. In both instances, the rule holds that if a person in custody has cut himself off from otherwise-available remedies on a particular matter due to his own procedural default, that default constitutes an independent and adequate ground sufficient to foreclose federal habeas review of the alleged error. <i>Ortiz,</i> 19 F.3d at 714 (citing <i>Wainwright v. Sykes,</i> 433 U.S. 72, 87, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977)); <i>accord Derman,</i> 298 F.3d at 44 &amp; n. 5 (noting that the Supreme Court has extended <i>Wainwright's</i>\"general rule that a criminal defendant must seasonably advance an objection to a potential constitutional infirmity in order to preserve the point for collateral attack\" to the section 2255 context) (citing <i>Bousley,</i> 523 U.S. at 622, 118 S.Ct. 1604); <i>see generally</i> 3 Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 596.1 (3d ed.2004); 17A <i>id.</i> &#167;&#167; 4266-4266.1 (2d ed.1988). So viewed, the rule has the salutary effect of preventing criminal defendants from using collateral review as a painless surrogate for direct appellate review. <i>See Bousley,</i> 523 U.S. at 621, 118 S.Ct. 1604 (discussing procedural default in the section 2255 context); <i>Reed v. Farley,</i> 512 U.S. 339, 354, 114 S.Ct. 2291, 129 L.Ed.2d 277 (1994) (discussing procedural default in the section 2254 context).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, judicial economy and finality, like comity, are institutional values that transcend the litigants' parochial interests. Where such values are in play, the court should have some say in deciding whether a defense should be considered or deemed waived. <i>Cf. Hardiman,</i> 971 F.2d at 503 (\"Unless the state procedural bar defense can be raised sua sponte, a state that fails to raise that defense can effectively force a federal court to review the merits of a case that may be simpler to decide on procedural grounds.\"). Preventing the facile use of a habeas petition as a substitute for a direct appeal can best be accomplished if district courts have the discretion to enforce the procedural default rule even though the government (federal or state) turns a blind eye. Consequently, we hold that a district court has the discretion, in a section 2255 case, to raise questions of procedural default sua sponte, even when the government has filed a reply and eschewed any reference to that defense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> This holding is consistent with the position adopted by the two other courts of appeals that have addressed this matter to date. <i>See United States v. Willis,</i> 273 F.3d 592, 596-97 (5th Cir.2001); <i>Hines,</i> 971 F.2d at 508-09; <i>cf. Femia v. United States,</i> 47 F.3d 519, 523 (2d Cir.1995) (relying on the interests of judicial economy and finality in allowing district court to dismiss section 2255 petition sua sponte on the procedural ground of abuse of the writ); <i>United States v. Fallon,</i> 992 F.2d 212, 213 (8th Cir.1993) (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This holding does not end our inquiry. Oakes argues persuasively that he should not have been required to be prescient. He says that he had no duty to anticipate potential affirmative defenses, but, rather, was entitled to wait and address such defenses when and if they were raised. Thus, even if the district court acted within the realm of its discretion in bringing up the issue of procedural default sua sponte &#8212; and we have held that it did &#8212; he (Oakes) should have been given notice of the court's intention and afforded an opportunity to respond.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that this position is well-taken. The ubiquity of the \"notice and opportunity to be heard\" principle as a matter of fundamental fairness is deeply engrained in our jurisprudence. <i>See Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill,</i> 470 U.S. 532, 542, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 84 L.Ed.2d 494 (1985) (stating that notice and an opportunity to be heard together comprise an \"essential principle of due process\"); <i>Earle v. McVeigh,</i> 91 U.S.(1 Otto) 503, 504, 23 L.Ed. 398 (1875) (citing the \"well-known legal maxim, that no one shall be condemned in his person or property without notice, and an opportunity to be heard in his defence\"). That this principle applies in the context of the procedural default defense cannot be gainsaid. <i>See, e.g., Willis,</i> 273 F.3d at 597; <i>Boyd v. Thompson,</i> 147 F.3d 1124, 1128 (9th Cir.1998); <i>Hines,</i> 971 F.2d at 509; <i>Hardiman,</i> 971 F.2d at 505. This is as it should be; procedural default is an affirmative defense, and a plaintiff generally is not required to negate an affirmative defense unless and until the defendant has placed it in issue. <i>See, e.g., Gomez v. Toledo,</i> 446 U.S. 635, 640, 100 S.Ct. 1920, 64 L.Ed.2d 572 (1980); <i>Tregenza v. Great Am. Communications Co.,</i> 12 F.3d 717, 718 (7th Cir.1993). That rule applies foursquare in habeas cases &#8212; and particularly so in cases involving pro se petitioners. <i>See, e.g., Hill v. Braxton,</i> 277 F.3d 701, 706 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the district court directed the government to reply to the petition. Its response omitted any mention of procedural default. At that juncture, Oakes was entitled to assume that the defense was by the boards and the fact that he had preemptively addressed the defense in his original pro se petition does not alter this entitlement. For one thing, once the government chose to eschew the defense despite the petition's explicit reference to it, Oakes had even more cause than usual to assume that the issue was out of the case. <i>Cf. Lewis v. Sternes,</i> 390 F.3d 1019, 1029 (7th Cir.2004) (noting that government's specific failure to raise procedural default after it has been mentioned elsewhere in pleadings may raise an inference of intentional waiver). For another thing, the petitioner's preemptive thrust did not exhaust the compendium of his possible answers to a procedural default defense. Had he been made aware that the issue was live, he could have mustered all of his arguments in response. <i>Cf. Bousley,</i> 523 U.S. at 623, 118 S.Ct. 1604 (finding it \"appropriate\" to permit a habeas petitioner to raise an actual innocence claim for the first time on remand even though he had not raised the claim in his initial petition).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, despite the government's nonchalance the district court lawfully exercised its discretion in choosing to resurrect the procedural default issue. At that point, however, the court should have given the petitioner notice of its intention and afforded him an opportunity to respond before dismissing the petition. <i>See Lugo v. Keane,</i> 15 F.3d 29, 30 (2d Cir.1994) (per curiam) (\"No principle is more fundamental to our system of judicial administration than that a person is entitled to notice before adverse judicial action is taken against him.\"); <i>cf. Berkovitz v. Home Box Office, Inc.,</i> 89 F.3d 24, 29 (1st Cir.1996) (enforcing, in the sua sponte summary judgment context, a requirement of notice and an opportunity to be heard).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In some circumstances, such an error might be harmless. That would be true if, say, a petitioner admittedly could not demonstrate either cause and prejudice or actual innocence. <i>Cf. Lattab v. Ashcroft,</i> 384 F.3d 8, 20-21 &amp; n. 6 (1st Cir.2004) (noting that claim of lack of due process need not be adjudicated when, in all events, petitioner's admissions conclusively showed a lack of any prejudice). But this is not such a case. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Oakes does not challenge the district court's holding that the supposed \"unavailability\" of a First Amendment defense does not constitute cause for his procedural default, <i>see supra</i> note 1, he does advance two other theories on which the default might be excused. First, he proffers a claim of actual innocence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Although the district court did state that it believed Oakes would not be able to successfully raise such a claim, <i>Oakes,</i> 224 F.Supp.2d at 302 n. 8, it hardly can fault the petitioner for failing to flesh out a winning \"actual innocence\" argument when it deprived him both of notice that such an argument would be necessary and of an opportunity to develop it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner also insinuates that he has another possible ground for cause: ineffective assistance of counsel. In this regard, he notes that the Supreme Court decided <i>Free Speech Coalition</i> while briefing was still ongoing in his direct appeal. Building on this foundation, he suggests that counsel's failure to raise the First Amendment argument during that proceeding constituted substandard performance that redounded to his detriment. Ineffective assistance of counsel, if proved, would constitute cause for excusing the procedural default. <i>Murray v. Carrier,</i> 477 U.S. 478, 488, 106 S.Ct. 2639, 91 L.Ed.2d 397 (1986); <i>Prou,</i> 199 F.3d at 47. Here too, however, Oakes was not given notice and a fair chance to make that case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Because the lower court failed to afford Oakes either notice of its intention to rely upon his procedural default or an opportunity to respond to that issue, we must vacate the judgment and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. In that respect, we hold only that Oakes should have a fair opportunity to show why his petition is not barred by procedural default. We take no view either of his claim of actual innocence or of his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Vacated and remanded.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> To this end, the district court noted that, at the time of the petitioner's sentencing, the First Amendment argument that the Supreme Court would later accept in<i>Free Speech Coalition</i> already had been made and rejected in this circuit. <i>See Oakes,</i> 224 F.Supp.2d at 300-01 (citing <i>United States v. Hilton,</i> 167 F.3d 61, 73 (1st Cir.1999)).

Oakes, a person incarcerated by reason of a previous conviction on federal child pornography charges, appeals from the dismissal of his petition to vacate his conviction and sentence. The district court based its decision on procedural default even though the government had failed to raise that defense in its response to Oakes's petition. In a challenge that frames a question of first impression in this circuit, Oakes now posits, inter alia, that the district court lacked the authority to interject the question of procedural default into the case sua sponte. Although we reject that premise, we nonetheless vacate the judgment below because the court failed to give Oakes either notice of its intention to consider the previously unraised issue or an opportunity to be heard on that issue before dismissing his petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We briefly rehearse the background. In July of 2000, police officers executed a search warrant and discovered approximately 45,000 images of what appeared to be child pornography in Oakes's computer files. The next month, a federal grand jury charged him with one count of knowingly receiving child pornography and one count of knowingly possessing child pornography. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2252A(a)(2)(A) &amp; (5)(B). Oakes eventually entered a guilty plea to the first of these counts and, on July 19, 2001, the district court sentenced him to a 54-month incarcerative term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Oakes appealed solely on sentence-related grounds. During the pendency of that appeal, the Supreme Court decided <i>Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118496\"><a href=\"/opinion/118496/ashcroft-v-free-speech-coalition/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">234</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118496\"><a href=\"/opinion/118496/ashcroft-v-free-speech-coalition/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">403</span></a></span> (2002). That decision held unconstitutional under the First Amendment the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996 (CPPA), insofar as it prohibited virtual pornographic images (i.e., images that were created without using actual children). <i>See id.</i> at 251-56, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118496\"><a href=\"/opinion/118496/ashcroft-v-free-speech-coalition/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1389</span></a></span>. The CPPA encompassed the statute of conviction in Oakes's case and, six days after the decision in <i>Free Speech Coalition,</i> Oakes filed in the district court a pro se petition to vacate his conviction and sentence pursuant to the federal habeas statute, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 26, 2002, Oakes filed a supporting memorandum that crystallized his argument. In it, he asserted that his conviction and sentence should be vacated because his guilty plea had been neither knowing nor voluntary. He based this assertion on a claim that he did not understand, at the time he pleaded guilty, that the government would have to prove that the images in his possession depicted actual children. Anticipating what seemed a likely government rejoinder, he also argued that his failure to challenge his guilty plea on direct appeal should be excused as the possibility of mounting a challenge based on the unconstitutionality of the CPPA was not knowable at the time of that appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court referred Oakes's petition to a magistrate judge, <i>see</i> Fed R. Civ. P. 72(b), who recommended that it be dismissed without prejudice due to the pendency of Oakes's direct appeal. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Gordon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"384349\"><a href=\"/opinion/384349/united-states-v-jacob-john-gordon/\"><span class=\"volume\">634</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">638</span></a></span>, 638 (1st Cir.1980) (holding that \"the orderly administration of criminal justice precludes a district court from considering a &#167; 2255 motion while review of the direct appeal is still pending\") (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Oakes objected, thus bringing the matter before the district court for de novo review. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(b). The court sensibly appointed counsel for Oakes and directed the government to reply to the petition. In its reply, the government did not raise a defense of procedural default; it argued only that <i>Free Speech Coalition</i> was inapposite to Oakes's case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 4, 2002, this court rejected the petitioner's direct appeal, <i>see United States v. Oakes,</i> 47 Fed.Appx. 5, 6 (1st Cir.2002) (per curiam), thus removing the sequencing obstacle that had concerned the magistrate judge. A few weeks later, the district court took up the habeas petition, raised sua sponte the question of procedural default, and denied relief on that basis. <i>United States v. Oakes,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2490116\"><a href=\"/opinion/2490116/united-states-v-oakes/\"><span class=\"volume\">224</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></a></span>, 298 (D.Me.2002). In the course of its ruling, the court discussed and discarded two possible avenues for avoiding the usual consequences of procedural default, namely, (i) cause and prejudice (including the argument preemptively raised in the petition),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and (ii) actual innocence. <i>Id.</i> at 300-02. Oakes was not afforded an opportunity to address either avenue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Oakes unsuccessfully sought to have the district court issue a certificate of appealability. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253(c)(1); 1st Cir. R. 22(b)(1). He then repaired to this court in search of such a certificate. We obliged, limiting review to \"[w]hether the district court [had] erred in denying petitioner's 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 motion on the ground of procedural default.\" This timely appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is a bedrock principle that, under ordinary circumstances, the voluntariness of a guilty plea can be questioned on collateral review under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 only if, and to the extent that, the plea has been challenged on direct appeal. <i>Bousley v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118205\"><a href=\"/opinion/118205/bousley-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">614</span></a></span>, 621, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118205\"><a href=\"/opinion/118205/bousley-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

If a federal habeas petitioner challenges his conviction or sentence on a ground that he did not advance on direct appeal, his claim is deemed procedurally defaulted. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A procedural default is not necessarily a total bar to federal habeas relief. Notwithstanding such a default, a federal habeas petition will be allowed to go forward if the petitioner can show either (i) that there is cause for the default and actual prejudice resulting from it, or (ii) that he is actually innocent of the offense of conviction. <i>See id.</i> at 622-23, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118205\"><a href=\"/opinion/118205/bousley-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Before us, the petitioner does not dispute the default, but, rather, challenges both the district court's ability to invoke the doctrine of procedural default sua sponte and the court's treatment of the two avenues that have the potential to offset his procedural default.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Oakes's first assignment of error has several dimensions. He begins with the proposition that procedural default is an affirmative defense and that, therefore, the government may lose the defense by neglecting to raise it in a response to a habeas petition. That is a correct statement of the law. <i>See, e.g., Howard v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"76617\"><a href=\"/opinion/76617/ronnie-maurice-howard-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">374</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1068</span></a></span>, 1073 (11th Cir.2004); <i>Doe v.

Building on this foundation, Oakes urges us to find that allowing the district court to \"choose sides\" by spontaneously curing the government's omission would undermine the adversarial system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This exhortation presents a question of first impression in this circuit. There are, however, straws in the wind. In the related context of habeas appeals from state convictions under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254, we have sanctioned the practice of district courts raising issues of procedural default sua sponte. <i>See, e.g., Brewer v. Marshall,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197471\"><a href=\"/opinion/197471/brewer-v-marshall-sheriff/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">993</span></a></span>, 999 (1st Cir.1997). Other courts of appeals have agreed that a district court has discretion to raise the issue of procedural default sua sponte in the section 2254 milieu. <i>See, e.g., Sweger v. Chesney,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778088\"><a href=\"/opinion/778088/nevin-g-sweger-jr-v-joseph-w-chesney-district-attorney-of-the-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">506</span></a></span>, 520-21 (3d Cir.2002); <i>Yeatts v.

Dubois,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195274\"><a href=\"/opinion/195274/ortiz-v-dubois/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">708</span></a></span>, 714-15 (1st Cir.1994). In that sense, section 2254 offers more fertile soil for sua sponte recognition of procedural default. Even so, the section 2254 cases furnish some support for allowing district courts, in section 2255 cases, to raise issues of procedural default sua sponte. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In regard to section 2254, courts also have noted that allowing sua sponte recognition of procedural defaults serves a second interest: the federal courts' interest in husbanding, and efficiently allocating, scarce judicial resources. <i>See Sweger,</i> 294 F.3d at 521; <i>Yeatts,</i> 166 F.3d at 261; <i>Ortiz,</i> 19 F.3d at 715; <i>see also Hardiman v.

That interest is equally compelling in section 2255 cases. And the praxis, in both sets of cases, implicates the federal courts' interest in finality. <i>Cf. Andiarena v.

In both instances, the rule holds that if a person in custody has cut himself off from otherwise-available remedies on a particular matter due to his own procedural default, that default constitutes an independent and adequate ground sufficient to foreclose federal habeas review of the alleged error. <i>Ortiz,</i> 19 F.3d at 714 (citing <i>Wainwright v.

Where such values are in play, the court should have some say in deciding whether a defense should be considered or deemed waived. <i>Cf. Hardiman,</i> 971 F.2d at 503 (\"Unless the state procedural bar defense can be raised sua sponte, a state that fails to raise that defense can effectively force a federal court to review the merits of a case that may be simpler to decide on procedural grounds.\"). Preventing the facile use of a habeas petition as a substitute for a direct appeal can best be accomplished if district courts have the discretion to enforce the procedural default rule even though the government (federal or state) turns a blind eye. Consequently, we hold that a district court has the discretion, in a section 2255 case, to raise questions of procedural default sua sponte, even when the government has filed a reply and eschewed any reference to that defense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> This holding is consistent with the position adopted by the two other courts of appeals that have addressed this matter to date. <i>See United States v. Willis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"25898\"><a href=\"/opinion/25898/united-states-v-willis/\"><span class=\"volume\">273</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">592</span></a></span>, 596-97 (5th Cir.2001); <i>Hines,</i> 971 F.2d at 508-09; <i>cf.

Oakes argues persuasively that he should not have been required to be prescient. He says that he had no duty to anticipate potential affirmative defenses, but, rather, was entitled to wait and address such defenses when and if they were raised. Thus, even if the district court acted within the realm of its discretion in bringing up the issue of procedural default sua sponte &#8212; and we have held that it did &#8212; he (Oakes) should have been given notice of the court's intention and afforded an opportunity to respond.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that this position is well-taken. The ubiquity of the \"notice and opportunity to be heard\" principle as a matter of fundamental fairness is deeply engrained in our jurisprudence. <i>See Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111372\"><a href=\"/opinion/111372/cleveland-bd-of-ed-v-loudermill/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">532</span></a></span>, 542, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111372\"><a href=\"/opinion/111372/cleveland-bd-of-ed-v-loudermill/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">494</span></a></span> (1985) (stating that notice and an opportunity to be heard together comprise an \"essential principle of due process\"); <i>Earle v.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">398</span></span> (1875) (citing the \"well-known legal maxim, that no one shall be condemned in his person or property without notice, and an opportunity to be heard in his defence\"). That this principle applies in the context of the procedural default defense cannot be gainsaid. <i>See, e.g., Willis,</i> 273 F.3d at 597; <i>Boyd v. Thompson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"755508\"><a href=\"/opinion/755508/98-cal-daily-op-serv-5100-98-daily-journal-dar-7195-danny-boyd-v-s/\"><span class=\"volume\">147</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1124</span></a></span>, 1128 (9th Cir.1998); <i>Hines,</i> 971 F.2d at 509; <i>Hardiman,</i> 971 F.2d at 505. This is as it should be; procedural default is an affirmative defense, and a plaintiff generally is not required to negate an affirmative defense unless and until the defendant has placed it in issue. <i>See, e.g., Gomez v. Toledo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110268\"><a href=\"/opinion/110268/gomez-v-toledo/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">635</span></a></span>, 640, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110268\"><a href=\"/opinion/110268/gomez-v-toledo/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

That rule applies foursquare in habeas cases &#8212; and particularly so in cases involving pro se petitioners. <i>See, e.g., Hill v. Braxton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776225\"><a href=\"/opinion/776225/sherwood-l-hill-v-d-a-braxton-buckingham-correctional-center/\"><span class=\"volume\">277</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">701</span></a></span>, 706 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the district court directed the government to reply to the petition. Its response omitted any mention of procedural default. At that juncture, Oakes was entitled to assume that the defense was by the boards and the fact that he had preemptively addressed the defense in his original pro se petition does not alter this entitlement. For one thing, once the government chose to eschew the defense despite the petition's explicit reference to it, Oakes had even more cause than usual to assume that the issue was out of the case. <i>Cf. Lewis v. Sternes,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788517\"><a href=\"/opinion/788517/peter-lewis-v-jerry-sternes/\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1019</span></a></span>, 1029 (7th Cir.2004) (noting that government's specific failure to raise procedural default after it has been mentioned elsewhere in pleadings may raise an inference of intentional waiver). For another thing, the petitioner's preemptive thrust did not exhaust the compendium of his possible answers to a procedural default defense. Had he been made aware that the issue was live, he could have mustered all of his arguments in response. <i>Cf. Bousley,</i> 523 U.S. at 623, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118205\"><a href=\"/opinion/118205/bousley-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

At that point, however, the court should have given the petitioner notice of its intention and afforded him an opportunity to respond before dismissing the petition. <i>See Lugo v. Keane,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"661556\"><a href=\"/opinion/661556/alfredo-lugo-v-john-p-keane/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span>, 30 (2d Cir.1994) (per curiam) (\"No principle is more fundamental to our system of judicial administration than that a person is entitled to notice before adverse judicial action is taken against him.\"); <i>cf.

Home Box Office, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196881\"><a href=\"/opinion/196881/berkovitz-v-home-box-office/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 29 (1st Cir.1996) (enforcing, in the sua sponte summary judgment context, a requirement of notice and an opportunity to be heard).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In some circumstances, such an error might be harmless. That would be true if, say, a petitioner admittedly could not demonstrate either cause and prejudice or actual innocence. <i>Cf. Lattab v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201243\"><a href=\"/opinion/201243/lattab-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 20-21 &amp; n. 6 (1st Cir.2004) (noting that claim of lack of due process need not be adjudicated when, in all events, petitioner's admissions conclusively showed a lack of any prejudice). But this is not such a case. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Oakes does not challenge the district court's holding that the supposed \"unavailability\" of a First Amendment defense does not constitute cause for his procedural default, <i>see supra</i> note 1, he does advance two other theories on which the default might be excused. First, he proffers a claim of actual innocence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Although the district court did state that it believed Oakes would not be able to successfully raise such a claim, <i>Oakes,</i> 224 F.Supp.2d at 302 n. 8, it hardly can fault the petitioner for failing to flesh out a winning \"actual innocence\" argument when it deprived him both of notice that such an argument would be necessary and of an opportunity to develop it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner also insinuates that he has another possible ground for cause: ineffective assistance of counsel. In this regard, he notes that the Supreme Court decided <i>Free Speech Coalition</i> while briefing was still ongoing in his direct appeal. Building on this foundation, he suggests that counsel's failure to raise the First Amendment argument during that proceeding constituted substandard performance that redounded to his detriment. Ineffective assistance of counsel, if proved, would constitute cause for excusing the procedural default. <i>Murray v. Carrier,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111727\"><a href=\"/opinion/111727/murray-v-carrier/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></a></span>, 488, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111727\"><a href=\"/opinion/111727/murray-v-carrier/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">397</span></a></span> (1986); <i>Prou,</i> 199 F.3d at 47. Here too, however, Oakes was not given notice and a fair chance to make that case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Because the lower court failed to afford Oakes either notice of its intention to rely upon his procedural default or an opportunity to respond to that issue, we must vacate the judgment and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. In that respect, we hold only that Oakes should have a fair opportunity to show why his petition is not barred by procedural default. We take no view either of his claim of actual innocence or of his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Vacated and remanded.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> To this end, the district court noted that, at the time of the petitioner's sentencing, the First Amendment argument that the Supreme Court would later accept in<i>Free Speech Coalition</i> already had been made and rejected in this circuit. <i>See Oakes,</i> 224 F.Supp.2d at 300-01 (citing <i>United States v.
