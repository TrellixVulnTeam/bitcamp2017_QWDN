Smith on brief for appellant.\n                  \nEdwin  J. Gale,  United  States  Attorney,  and Zechariah  Chafee,\n                                                                 \nAssistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n                                         \n\n                                         \n\n          Per  Curiam.    Appellant Wesley  Gonzalez  pleaded\n                     \n\nguilty  to  a  one-count indictment  which  charged  him with\n\npossession of a  substance containing a detectable  amount of\n\ncocaine with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C.  \n\n841(a)(1).  He appeals two aspects of the sentence imposed by\n\nthe  district   court  under  the  United  States  Sentencing\n\nGuidelines (U.S.S.G.).   Because the appeal does  not present\n\nany  substantial  questions,  we   summarily  dispose  of  it\n\npursuant to Local Rule 27.1.\n\n          1.    Appellant  claims  that  the  district  court\n\nimproperly fined  him for the  cost of his five-year  term of\n\nsupervised release.  This fine amounts to $6,918 and is to be\n\npaid in  monthly installments  of $115.30  once appellant  is\n\nreleased.  According  to appellant, U.S.S.G.    5E1.2(i) does\n\nnot permit such a fine in his case because the district court\n\n\"waived\" the  assessment of a punitive fine.\n\n          U.S.S.G.   5E1.2(a) states that \"[t]he  court shall\n\nimpose  a  fine  in all  cases,  except  where the  defendant\n\nestablishes that  he is unable  to pay  and is not  likely to\n\nbecome able  to pay  any fine.\"   U.S.S.G.    5E1.2(i) states\n\nthat [n]otwithstanding . . . the provisions of subsection (c)\n\n[list  of  minimum   and  maximum  fines],  but   subject  to\n\nsubsection (f)  [waiver or  imposition of  lesser fine],  the\n\ncourt shall impose an additional fine amount that is at least\n\nsufficient to pay  the costs to the  government of any .  . .\n\nsupervised release ordered.\"  In United States v. Corral, 964\n                                                        \n\nF.2d  83 (1st Cir. 1992), we held  that \"a district court may\n\nnot  impose a duty  to pay for the  costs of incarceration or\n\nsupervised  release if the defendant is indigent for purposes\n\nof  a  [punitive] fine  under  Sentencing Guidelines  section\n\n5E1.2(a).\"  Id. at 84.\n               \n\n          Corral is of no avail  to appellant for the  simple\n                \n\nreason  that the  district  court,  in  fact,  did  impose  a\n\npunitive fine under  U.S.S.G.   5E1.2(a).   Appellant's claim\n\nto the  contrary rests  upon page 5  of the Judgment  form on\n\nwhich  the district  court  checked  the  box  preceding  the\n\nfollowing words:   \"Fine is waived or is  below the guideline\n\nrange, because of the defendant's inability to pay.\"  By only\n\nfocussing   on  the  \"inability  to  pay\"  language  for  the\n\nproposition  that a  punitive  fine  was \"waived,\"  appellant\n\nconveniently  ignores what the  district court judge  said at\n\nthe sentencing hearing concerning a fine under   5E1.2(a):\n\n               As far as the fine is concerned,  it\n          does  not  appear  you  have  substantial\n          assets.  You  have some assets  and based\n          on  that, the Court will impose a fine in\n                                                   \n          the amount of one  hundred dollars and  a\n                                            \n          special assessment in the amount of fifty\n          dollars as required by law.\n\nTranscript of Sentencing Hearing,  at 17-18 (emphasis added).\n\nIndeed, page 4 of the Judgment form specifically  states that\n\nthe total fine  of $7,018 is composed  of a fine of  $100 and\n                                                \n\n                             -3-\n\nthe cost of  supervised release of $6,918.   Thus, this claim\n\nis without merit.\n\n          2.  Appellant's second assignment of error concerns\n\nthe conversion  of $29,990  into 1,000  grams of  cocaine for\n\nsentencing purposes under U.S.S.G.   1B1.3(a)(2) and   2D1.1.\n\nThis  sum was  part  of the  cash seized  during a  search of\n\nappellant's  apartment  conducted  by  the  Drug  Enforcement\n\nAdministration  (DEA).  Also  seized were 3  plastic sandwich\n\nbags containing a total of 17.6 grams of 80% pure  cocaine, a\n\npager, a cellular  telephone, a shoe box filled  with plastic\n\nbags, three  sifters, a spoon  and a triple-beam scale.   The\n\nlatter three  items were  found  to have  cocaine residue  on\n\nthem;  it is  undisputed that  all of  the seized  items were\n\n\"common\" implements of the cocaine trade.\n\n          As for  the cash,  DEA agents  found $4,450 in  the\n\nbedroom and $3,990 on a table in the living room.   They also\n\ndiscovered $26,000 hidden beneath  a stereo speaker.  Out  of\n\nthe total  amount, the government  accepted appellant's claim\n\nthat $4,450 represented the settlement of an insurance claim.\n\nThis  left the  $29,990 which  the  Presentence Report  (PSI)\n\nconcluded represented the proceeds of sales of 1,000 grams of\n\ncocaine.\n\n          Appellant  did  not object  at  sentencing  to this\n\ncalculation.   Normally, such a  failure results in a waiver.\n\nSee United States v. Dietz,  950 F.2d 50, 55 (1st Cir.  1991)\n                          \n\n                             -4-\n\n(\"in connection with  sentencing as in other contexts,  . . .\n\narguments not seasonably addressed to the trial court may not\n\nbe  raised  for  the  first  time  in  an  appellate venue\").\n\nAppellant urges, nonetheless, that where a fundamental  error\n\nin  the application  of the Guidelines  affects \"substantial\"\n\nrights,  review  is  proper  to  prevent  a  \"miscarriage  of\n\njustice.\"   See United States  v. Agoro, 996 F.2d  1288, 1291\n                                       \n\n(1st  Cir. 1993) (where government agreed with defendant that\n\nsentence  imposed  by district  court exceeded  the allowable\n\nguideline range, court  would address claim raised  for first\n\ntime on appeal).\n\n          This  is  not  such a  case.    Indeed, appellant's\n\narguments  fall  short  of demonstrating  any  defect  in the\n                                             \n\ncourt's  sentencing calculations.    Pursuant  to U.S.S.G.   \n\n1B1.3(a)(2),  appellant is responsible for all acts that were\n\n\"part of the same course of  conduct or common scheme or plan\n\nas the offense  of conviction. . .  .\"  See United  States v.\n                                                          \n\nFigueroa, 976 F.2d 1446, 1460 (1st  Cir. 1992), cert. denied,\n                                                            \n\n113 S. Ct.  1346 (1993).  When applied to  drug offenses, the\n\ndistrict court  may take into  account \"the amount  of drugs,\n\nwhether or not  `specified in the  count of conviction,'\"  so\n\nlong  as the  drugs  are  part of  the  conduct underlying  a\n\ndefendant's conviction.   United States v. Tabares,  951 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n405, 410 (1st  Cir. 1991) (quoting    1B1.3(a)(2) &amp;  comment.\n\n(backg'd)).    Further,  in  determining  a  defendant's base\n\n                             -5-\n\noffense level where  \"the amount seized does not  reflect the\n\nscale  of  the  offense,  the  court  shall  approximate  the\n\nquantity of  the controlled  substance.\"   U.S.S.G.    2D1.1,\n\ncommentary (n.12).\n\n          Appellant argues  that  the  government  failed  to\n\nestablish by a preponderance of the evidence that there was a\n\nsufficient  connection between the $29,990 and the offense to\n\nwhich he  pleaded guilty.   Specifically,  appellant contends\n\nthat  the PSI  merely concluded  that  the money  represented\n\nproceeds from other drug transactions without  presenting any\n\nevidence of  actual sales  or any  evidence of  a conspiracy.\n\nInstead,  appellant asserts,  the only concrete  evidence was\n\nthe  17.6 grams  found in  his apartment.   This  should have\n\nresulted,  he goes on,  in a finding that  he was involved in\n\nonly a \"very small scale operation.\"  Thus, he concludes that\n\nour decision in  United States v. Gerante, 891  F.2d 364 (1st\n                                         \n\nCir.  1989), does  not  control  and  an  \"approximation\"  by\n\nconverting  the  cash into  1,000  grams of  cocaine  was not\n\npermitted.\n\n          In  Gerante, defendant was arrested while he was in\n                     \n\npossession of 4.98 kilograms of cocaine.  A subsequent search\n\nof  his home revealed small additional quantities of cocaine,\n\nfive loaded guns  and $68,000.  Upon being  questioned by DEA\n\nagents, defendant  stated, among  other things,  that he  had\n\nbeen trafficking in multi-kilogram amounts of cocaine for six\n\n                             -6-\n\nmonths and that the $68,000 represented proceeds from a prior\n\ndeal.  We  held that the district  court's determination that\n\nthe drugs  purchased with the  $68,000 were part of  the same\n\ncourse  of conduct  under  U.S.S.G.     1B1.3(a)(2)  was  not\n\nclearly  erroneous.   891  F.2d at  368.   As  a result,  the\n\nconversion  of  the cash  into  a  quantity  of  cocaine  was\n\npermitted by the Guidelines, in  part, because the amount  of\n\ndrugs seized did  not reflect the scale of the  offense.  Id.\n                                                             \n\nat 369 (citation omitted).\n\n          Appellant's  effort   to  distinguish   Gerante  is\n                                                         \n\nunavailing.   Conspicuously absent  from his  version of  the\n\nevents  is  the  admission,  made  by  his  attorney  at  the\n\nsentencing hearing,  that the  $29,990, in fact,  represented\n\nproceeds from sales of cocaine.  See Transcript of Sentencing\n                                    \n\nHearing, at 4, 14 (in  arguing for a reduction for acceptance\n\nof responsibility, counsel emphasized the fact that appellant\n\ndid  not \"fight\"  the conversion  of the  money into  sums of\n\ncocaine and acknowledged that the money appellant made to buy\n\ncocaine put him in a higher guideline range).  As in Gerante,\n                                                            \n\nthis admission  provides sufficient evidence that the $29,990\n\nwas  part of  the same  course of  conduct as the  offense of\n\nconviction.  See United States v. Figueroa, 976 F.2d at 1460-\n                                          \n\n61 (where defendants in taped  telephone conversations stated\n\nthat they  sold $6,000  worth of \"dime\"  bags of  cocaine per\n\nday,  no clear error  in approximating the  amount of cocaine\n\n                             -7-\n\nbased on \"the  sums of money admittedly  received\") (footnote\n\nomitted).\n\n          Finally, we  reject appellant's  argument that  the\n\nresult of the conversion (which raised his base offense level\n\nfrom   12   to    26)   rendered   his    sentence   \"grossly\n\ndisproportionate\" and  \"inequitable.\"   Similar increases  in\n\nsentencing ranges due to the addition of  quantities of drugs\n\nnot included in  the offense conduct have been  upheld.  See,\n                                                            \n\ne.g., United States v.

Indeed, page 4 of the Judgment form specifically states that the total fine of $7,018 is composed of a fine of $100 and the cost of supervised release of $6,918.  Thus, this claim is without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Appellant's second assignment of error concerns the conversion of $29,990 into 1,000 grams of cocaine for sentencing purposes under U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3(a)(2) and &#167; 2D1.1.  This sum was part of the cash seized during a search of appellant's apartment conducted by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).  Also seized were 3 plastic sandwich bags containing a total of 17.6 grams of 80% pure cocaine, a pager, a cellular telephone, a shoe box filled with plastic bags, three sifters, a spoon and a triple-beam scale.  The latter three items were found to have cocaine residue on them;  it is undisputed that all of the seized items were \"common\" implements of the cocaine trade.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the cash, DEA agents found $4,450 in the bedroom and $3,990 on a table in the living room.  They also discovered $26,000 hidden beneath a stereo speaker.  Out of the total amount, the government accepted appellant's claim that $4,450 represented the settlement of an insurance claim.  This left the $29,990 which the Presentence Report (PSI) concluded represented the proceeds of sales of 1,000 grams of cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant did not object at sentencing to this calculation.  Normally, such a failure results in a waiver.   See United States v. Dietz, 950 F.2d 50, 55 (1st Cir. 1991) (\"in connection with sentencing as in other contexts, ... arguments not seasonably addressed to the trial court may not be raised for the first time in an appellate venue\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant urges, nonetheless, that where a fundamental error in the application of the Guidelines affects \"substantial\" rights, review is proper to prevent a \"miscarriage of justice.\"   See United States v. Agoro, 996 F.2d 1288, 1291 (1st Cir. 1993) (where government agreed with defendant that sentence imposed by district court exceeded the allowable guideline range, court would address claim raised for first time on appeal).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not such a case.  Indeed, appellant's arguments fall short of demonstrating any defect in the court's sentencing calculations.  Pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3(a)(2), appellant is responsible for all acts that were \"part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction....\"   See United States v. Figueroa, 976 F.2d 1446, 1460 (1st Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 1346 (1993).  When applied to drug offenses, the district court may take into account \"the amount of drugs, whether or not 'specified in the count of conviction,' \" so long as the drugs are part of the conduct underlying a defendant's conviction.   United States v. Tabares, 951 F.2d 405, 410 (1st Cir. 1991) (quoting &#167; 1B1.3(a)(2) &amp; comment.  (backg'd)).  Further, in determining a defendant's base offense level where \"the amount seized does not reflect the scale of the offense, the court shall approximate the quantity of the controlled substance.\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1, commentary (n.12).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant argues that the government failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that there was a sufficient connection between the $29,990 and the offense to which he pleaded guilty.  Specifically, appellant contends that the PSI merely concluded that the money represented proceeds from other drug transactions without presenting any evidence of actual sales or any evidence of a conspiracy.  Instead, appellant asserts, the only concrete evidence was the 17.6 grams found in his apartment.  This should have resulted, he goes on, in a finding that he was involved in only a \"very small scale operation.\"  Thus, he concludes that our decision in  United States v. Gerante, 891 F.2d 364 (1st Cir. 1989), does not control and an \"approximation\" by converting the cash into 1,000 grams of cocaine was not permitted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Gerante, defendant was arrested while he was in possession of 4.98 kilograms of cocaine.  A subsequent search of his home revealed small additional quantities of cocaine, five loaded guns and $68,000.  Upon being questioned by DEA agents, defendant stated, among other things, that he had been trafficking in multi-kilogram amounts of cocaine for six months and that the $68,000 represented proceeds from a prior deal.  We held that the district court's determination that the drugs purchased with the $68,000 were part of the same course of conduct under U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3(a)(2) was not clearly erroneous.  891 F.2d at 368.  As a result, the conversion of the cash into a quantity of cocaine was permitted by the Guidelines, in part, because the amount of drugs seized did not reflect the scale of the offense.   Id. at 369 (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's effort to distinguish Gerante is unavailing.  Conspicuously absent from his version of the events is the admission, made by his attorney at the sentencing hearing, that the $29,990, in fact, represented proceeds from sales of cocaine.  See Transcript of Sentencing Hearing, at 4, 14 (in arguing for a reduction for acceptance of responsibility, counsel emphasized the fact that appellant did not \"fight\" the conversion of the money into sums of cocaine and acknowledged that the money appellant made to buy cocaine put him in a higher guideline range).  As in Gerante, this admission provides sufficient evidence that the $29,990 was part of the same course of conduct as the offense of conviction.   See United States v. Figueroa, 976 F.2d at 1460-61 (where defendants in taped telephone conversations stated that they sold $6,000 worth of \"dime\" bags of cocaine per day, no clear error in approximating the amount of cocaine based on \"the sums of money admittedly received\") (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we reject appellant's argument that the result of the conversion (which raised his base offense level from 12 to 26) rendered his sentence \"grossly disproportionate\" and \"inequitable.\"  Similar increases in sentencing ranges due to the addition of quantities of drugs not included in the offense conduct have been upheld.   See, e.g., United States v. Sklar, 920 F.2d 107, 112-14 (1st Cir. 1990) (despite seizure of only one package containing cocaine, court's addition for sentencing purposes of estimated quantities of cocaine contained in eleven previously mailed packages-which essentially doubled guideline range-not clearly erroneous);   United States v. Vazzano, 906 F.2d 879, 884 (2d Cir. 1990) (addition of extra amount of cocaine defendant told informant he had recently sold for purposes of calculating base offense level held not clear error;  addition almost tripled guideline range).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant adds the claim that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance in violation of the Sixth Amendment by, among other omissions, failing to object at the sentencing hearing to the conversion of the $29,990 into 1,000 grams of cocaine.  \"We have held with a regularity bordering on the monotonous that fact-specific claims of ineffective assistance cannot make their debut on direct review of criminal convictions, but, rather, must originally be presented to, and acted upon by, the trial court.\"  United States v. Mala, No. 91-2229, slip op. at 9-10 (1st Cir.  October 27, 1993).
