Nathaniel M. Gorton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                    Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n\n                   Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                   and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Beverly Chorbajian for appellant.\n     Cynthia A. Young, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief,\nfor appellee.\n\n\n\n                        November 23, 2005\n\f          HOWARD, Circuit Judge. Asserting that the district court\n\nerroneously permitted the government to present hearsay evidence at\n\nhis revocation hearing, Corey Rondeau appeals from a final judgment\n\nrevoking his supervised release.      We affirm.\n\n                                 I.\n\n          In May 1999, Rondeau pleaded guilty to conspiracy to\n\npossess and distribute cocaine base and possession of cocaine base\n\nwith the intent to distribute.   See 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) & 846.\n\nHe was sentenced to 65 months of imprisonment and five years of\n\nsupervised release.\n\n          On July 17, 2004, after Rondeau had served his initial\n\nprison sentence and while on supervised release, he was arrested by\n\nthe Worcester, Massachusetts police for committing an assault with\n\na dangerous weapon.   The United States Probation Office petitioned\n\nthe district court to revoke Rondeau's supervised release, alleging\n\nthat Rondeau had committed two grade A violations (the assault and\n\nillegally possessing a firearm) and two grade C violations (failing\n\nto participate in a drug test and failing to meet with a probation\n\nofficer as scheduled).1\n\n\n     1\n      Under the relevant provisions of the United States Sentencing\nGuidelines, violations of supervised release are classified into\nthree grades: A, B, and C.       Grade A violations include the\ncommission of a violent felony.       Grade C violations include\nviolations of drug testing and reporting conditions. If the court\nfinds a grade A violation, it must revoke the defendant's release,\nbut it need not to do so for a grade C violation. If two or more\nseparate violations have occurred, the more (or most) serious\nviolation controls the punishment. See U.S.S.G. §§ 7B1.1 & 7B1.3\n\n                                 -2-\n\f            In December 2004, the district court held an evidentiary\n\nhearing on the government's motion to revoke Rondeau's supervised\n\nrelease.    Rondeau admitted the grade C violations but denied the\n\ngrade A violations.      The district court thus only heard evidence\n\nrelated to the assault and the unlawful possession of a firearm.\n\n            The   government   relied     on   the   testimony   of     Sergeant\n\nMichael McKiernan of the Worcester Police Department.                 McKiernan\n\ntestified that, on July 17, 2004, he became involved in the\n\ninvestigation of an incident at 128 Chino Street in Worcester.                 In\n\nthe early morning hours of July 17th, the police received two 911\n\ncalls. Several officers, not including McKiernan, responded to the\n\ncalls and, on arriving at the scene, were informed by Marsha\n\nWilliams,   one   of   the   callers,   that    Rondeau   had    come    to   her\n\napartment building looking for his girlfriend.                   According to\n\nWilliams, when she told Rondeau that his girlfriend was not there,\n\nhe began arguing with her, held a gun to her head, threatened to\n\nkill her, and then left in a dark-colored Ford Expedition.\n\n            Williams then gave the police a handwritten statement\n\nmatching her verbal account.       Subsequent to obtaining the written\n\nstatement, McKiernan spoke with Williams more than a dozen times,\n\nand she never changed her account of the altercation with Rondeau.\n\n\n\n\n(2004).\n\n                                    -3-\n\f           McKiernan also testified to the other 911 call that the\n\npolice received about the incident.      This call had been placed by\n\nVanessa   Estrada,   a   thirteen-year-old   girl   who   lived   in   the\n\napartment that Rondeau attempted to enter.          As the assault was\n\noccurring, Estrada called to report that Rondeau was holding a gun\n\nto Williams' head.       In a handwritten statement to the police,\n\nEstrada explained that Rondeau had banged on the door of her\n\napartment but that another occupant of the apartment had refused to\n\nopen the door.    According to Estrada, Williams approached Rondeau\n\nto tell him that his girlfriend was not present.          At that point,\n\nRondeau pulled the gun and pointed it at Williams.\n\n           Several minutes after the assault, the police stopped a\n\nblack Ford Expedition a few blocks from Chino Street.         There were\n\nsix people in the car, including Rondeau, who was in the rear on\n\nthe passenger side.      The officers found two handguns, each loaded\n\nwith one round in the chamber.     One was a 9 mm Luger found in the\n\nclosed console in the middle of the rear seat.      The other was a .25\n\ncaliber Colt found on the floor on the driver's side of the rear\n\nseat.   Williams later identified the Colt the gun that Rondeau had\n\npointed at her.\n\n           The government rested after McKiernan's testimony, the\n\nintroduction of Williams' and Estrada's written statements, and the\n\nintroduction of the relevant police reports.          Rondeau did not\n\npresent evidence but objected to the government's proof on the\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fground   that   he    did   not   have    an    opportunity    to    confront     the\n\nwitnesses against him.          The government responded that it did not\n\ncall   Williams      or   the   thirteen-year      old   Estrada     in   light   of\n\nWilliams' expressed safety concern, based in part on her knowledge\n\nthat Rondeau was a \"gang member.\" The government argued that their\n\nlive   testimony      was   unnecessary        because   the   hearsay    evidence\n\npresented was reliable. The district court agreed and admitted the\n\nevidence.    It then concluded that the government had established,\n\nby a preponderance of the evidence, that Rondeau had assaulted\n\nWilliams with a deadly weapon and was a felon unlawfully in\n\npossession of a firearm.          The court imposed an additional twenty-\n\nfour months of incarceration.\n\n                                         II.\n\n            Rondeau argues that the presentation of hearsay evidence,\n\nthrough the testimony of Sergeant McKiernan, violated both his\n\nSixth Amendment right to confront witnesses, as recognized in\n\nCrawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004), and his rights under\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 32.1(b)(2)(C).           We begin with the constitutional\n\nquestion, which we consider de novo.             See United States v. Cianci,\n\n378 F.3d 71, 101 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n            In Crawford, the Supreme Court held that, in a criminal\n\nprosecution, the Sixth Amendment forbids the introduction of an\n\nout-of-court      testimonial       statement       unless     the    witness     is\n\nunavailable and the defendant has previously had an opportunity to\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fcross-examine her.        See 541 U.S. at 68.         Even if Williams' and\n\nEstrada's statements constituted testimonial hearsay, we hold that\n\nCrawford     does   not    apply   to   supervised      release    revocation\n\nproceedings.2\n\n             The Confrontation Clause provides defendants with the\n\nright to confront adverse witnesses \"[i]n criminal prosecutions.\"\n\nU.S. Const. amend. VI.      The Supreme Court has long recognized that\n\na   parole   revocation    hearing,     which   for   present     purposes    is\n\nanalogous to a supervised release hearing, see United States v.\n\nCorrea-Torres, 326 F.3d 18, 22 (1st Cir. 2003), is not equivalent\n\nto \"a criminal prosecution.\"        Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471,\n\n480 (1972). Therefore, \"the full panoply of rights due a defendant\n\nin such a proceeding does not apply to parole revocations.\"                  Id.\n\nRather, the proceeding \"should be flexible enough to consider\n\nevidence including letter affidavits, and other material that would\n\nnot be admissible in an adversary criminal trial.\"              Id. at 489.\n\n             Given that the Confrontation Clause focuses on \"criminal\n\nprosecutions,\"      we have not found the Clause to be applicable to\n\npost-conviction proceedings.          See United States v. Luciano, 414\n\nF.3d 174, 179 (1st Cir. 2005) (holding that the Confrontation\n\nClause does not apply to sentencing hearings); see also United\n\nStates v. Work, 409 F.3d 484, 491 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"The law is\n\n\n\n      2\n      We reserved this issue in United States v. Taveras, 380 F.3d\n532, 538 n.8 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                                      -6-\n\fclear that once the original sentence has been imposed in a\n\ncriminal case, further proceedings with respect to that sentence\n\nare not governed by Sixth Amendment protections.\").                       Nothing in\n\nCrawford indicates that the Supreme Court intended to extend the\n\nConfrontation       Clause's      reach   beyond       the   criminal    prosecution\n\ncontext.    See Luciano, 414 F.3d at 179; United States v. Aspinall,\n\n389 F.3d 332, 342-43 (2d Cir. 2004).                   We therefore join several\n\nother circuits in concluding that, because a supervised release\n\nrevocation hearing is not a \"criminal prosecution,\" Crawford does\n\nnot apply.    See Hall, 419 F.3d 980, 985-86 (9th Cir. 2005); United\n\nStates v. Kirby, 418 F.3d 621, 627-28 (6th Cir. 2005); Aspinall,\n\n389 F.3d at 342-43; United States v. Martin, 382 F.3d 840, 844 n.4\n\n(8th Cir. 2004).3\n\n             Although Rondeau does not have a Sixth Amendment right to\n\nexamine adverse witnesses, he does have a limited confrontation\n\nright under Fed. R. Crim. P. 32.1(b)(2)(C).                     This Rule provides\n\nthat a defendant subject to supervised release revocation \"is\n\nentitled to an opportunity to . . . question any adverse witness\n\nunless the court determines that the interest of justice does not\n\nrequire    the     witness   to    appear     .    .   .   .\"    Fed.    R.   Crim   P.\n\n32.1(b)(2)(C).\n\n             The    Advisory      Committee       Notes    to   Rule    32.1(b)(2)(C)\n\n\n    3\n     Rondeau cites Ash v. Reilly, 354 F. Supp. 2d 1, 8-9 (D.D.C.\n2004),to argue that Crawford should apply in these circumstances.\nFor the reasons discussed above, we do not find Ash persuasive.\n\n                                          -7-\n\fexplain that a court should apply this Rule by balancing the\n\nreleasee's right to confront witnesses with the government's good\n\ncause for denying confrontation.                See Taveras, 380 F.3d at 536\n\n(applying the relevant Advisory Committee Notes under similar\n\ncircumstances).       In conducting this analysis, a court should\n\nconsider   the     reliability     of    the     hearsay      testimony     and    the\n\ngovernment's      reason   for    declining      to    produce      the    declarant.\n\nSee id. at 536 (\"An important element of the good cause analysis is\n\nthe reliability of the evidence that the Government seeks to\n\nintroduce.\"); Martin, 382 F.3d at 845 (stating that a court should\n\nconsider   \"the    explanation     the    government       offers     of    why    live\n\ntestimony is undesirable or impracticable\") (internal citation and\n\nquotation marks omitted).         We review the district court's decision\n\nto admit hearsay evidence under Rule 32.1(b)(2)(C) for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.    See Taveras, 380 F.3d at 536.\n\n           The     district      court    was    within       its   discretion      in\n\nconcluding that the hearsay evidence against Rondeau was reliable.\n\nFirst,   Williams'     and    Estrada's        911    calls    were   made    as    or\n\nimmediately after Rondeau threatened Williams with the gun.                       Given\n\nthe volatility of the situation, these statements qualify as\n\nexcited utterances.        See Fed. R. Evid. 803(2); United States v.\n\nBrito, 427 F.3d 53, 62-63 (1st Cir. 2005).                Second, Williams' and\n\nEstrada's accounts of the assault were offered to the police\n\nseparately, but were materially identical.                 See United States v.\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fWashington, 38 Fed. Appx. 522, 524 (10th Cir. 2002) (statements by\n\ntwo witnesses were considered reliable where the statements were\n\ngiven to the police separately but were consistent).                       Third,\n\nWilliams and Estrada reduced their verbal statements to writing.\n\nCompare United States v. Comito, 177 F.3d 1166, 1171 (9th Cir.\n\n1999) (concluding that \"verbal allegations are . . . the least\n\nreliable type of hearsay\") with United States v. Pratt, 52 F.3d\n\n671,   677   (7th    Cir.    1995)     (concluding     that   officer's   hearsay\n\ntestimony was reliable because it was consistent with the written\n\nstatements    of    the     victim).        Fourth,   McKiernan   discussed     the\n\nincident with Williams over a dozen times, and she never changed\n\nher description of the assault.                   See Hall, 419 F.3d at 987\n\n(statement deemed reliable, in part, because declarant provided\n\nsame account several times).                Finally, the police corroborated\n\nWilliams' statement by locating Rondeau near Williams' building in\n\na car that matched Williams' description and in which they also\n\ndiscovered the gun that Williams later identified.                     See United\n\nStates v. Waters, 158 F.3d 933, 941 (6th Cir. 1998) (admitting\n\nhearsay statement of a co-conspirator at revocation hearing where\n\nthe government had confirmed some of the details in the statement).\n\n             In     challenging      the      district      court's   reliability\n\ndetermination, Rondeau relies on Taveras.                That case does not help\n\nhim.   In Taveras, the government sought to introduce a hearsay\n\nstatement    from    the    victim     of    an   alleged   assault   through   the\n\n\n                                            -9-\n\ftestimony of the releasee's probation officer.                 380 F.3d at 535.\n\nThe victim made the statement to the probation officer verbally,\n\nthe day after the alleged incident, but later recanted in a written\n\nstatement.       Id.     We concluded that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion in deeming the victim's verbal statement reliable for\n\nthree reasons:          (1) the statement was not an excited utterance\n\nbecause the victim made it the day after the alleged assault; (2)\n\nthe victim's statement was not reduced to writing and was later\n\nrecanted; and (3) the probation officer had limited contact with\n\nthe     victim    and    therefore    could    not   reasonably      assess   her\n\ncredibility.       Id. at 537-38.        None of these factors is present\n\nhere.\n\n            We turn next to the adequacy of the government's reason\n\nfor not presenting the declarants' live testimony.               The government\n\nfocused on Williams' concern about testifying, based in part on her\n\nknowledge of Rondeau's gang membership.              McKiernan supported the\n\ngovernment's approach by testifying that, in his discussions with\n\nWilliams, she had expressed fear for her safety in the event she\n\nwere to testify.         This safety concern applied equally to Estrada,\n\nwho also knew Rondeau and was only thirteen.              Because the safety\n\nconcern    was    supported    by    record   evidence,   it   was   within   the\n\ndistrict court's discretion to conclude that there was good reason\n\nfor the declarants not to testify.             See United States v. Jones,\n\n299 F.3d 103, 113 (2d Cir. 2002) (the government provided an\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\fadequate reason for not presenting the declarants to testify where\n\nthe releasee's \"history of violent conduct made reprisal against\n\nthem a possibility\").\n\n           The   hearsay   evidence   presented   against   Rondeau   was\n\nreliable, and the government presented a sufficient reason for not\n\ncalling the declarants to testify.        Consequently, the district\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion under Rule 32.1(b)(2)(C) in\n\nadmitting the hearsay evidence at Rondeau's revocation hearing.\n\n           Rondeau also claims that there was insufficient evidence\n\nto conclude that he committed an assault or illegally possessed a\n\nfirearm.   We consider this argument de novo, taking the facts in\n\nthe light most favorable to the government, to determine whether\n\nthere was proof, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Rondeau\n\nviolated his supervised release conditions.       See United States v.\n\nPortalla, 985 F.2d 621, 622 (1st Cir. 1993).        Rondeau challenges\n\nthe sufficiency of the evidence by discounting Williams' and\n\nEstrada's statements as unreliable and then claiming that the\n\nremaining evidence was insufficient.        But, as discussed above,\n\nWilliams' and Estrada's statements were properly considered and,\n\nwhen taken into account, there is no question that this evidence\n\nsupports the conclusion that Rondeau assaulted Williams while\n\nillegally possessing a gun.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\f",

The district court thus only heard evidence related to the assault and the unlawful possession of a firearm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government relied on the testimony of Sergeant Michael McKiernan of the Worcester Police Department. McKiernan testified that, on July 17, 2004, he became involved in the investigation of an incident at 128 Chino Street in Worcester. In the early morning hours of July 17th, the police received two 911 calls. Several officers, not including McKiernan, responded to the calls and, on arriving at the scene, were informed by Marsha Williams, one of the callers, that Rondeau had come to her apartment building looking for his girlfriend. According to Williams, when she told Rondeau that his girlfriend was not there, he began arguing with her, held a gun to her head, threatened to kill her, and then left in a dark-colored Ford Expedition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Williams then gave the police a handwritten statement matching her verbal account.

This call had been placed by Vanessa Estrada, a thirteen-year-old girl who lived in the apartment that Rondeau attempted to enter. As the assault was occurring, Estrada called to report that Rondeau was holding a gun to Williams' head. In a handwritten statement to the police, Estrada explained that Rondeau had banged on the door of her apartment but that another occupant of the apartment had refused to open the door. According to Estrada, Williams approached Rondeau to tell him that his girlfriend was not present. At that point, Rondeau pulled the gun and pointed it at Williams.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several minutes after the assault, the police stopped a black Ford Expedition a few blocks from Chino Street. There were six people in the car, including Rondeau, who was in the rear on the passenger side. The officers found two handguns, each loaded with one round in the chamber. One was a 9 mm Luger found in the closed console in the middle of the rear seat. The other was a .25 caliber Colt found on the floor on the driver's side of the rear seat. Williams later identified the Colt an the gun that Rondeau had pointed at her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government rested after McKiernan's testimony, the introduction of Williams' and Estrada's written statements, and the introduction of the relevant police reports. Rondeau did not present evidence but objected to the government's proof on the ground that he did not have an opportunity to confront the witnesses against him. The government responded that it did not call Williams or the thirteen-year old Estrada in light of Williams' expressed safety concern, based in part on her knowledge that Rondeau was a \"gang member.\" The government argued that their live testimony was unnecessary because the hearsay evidence presented was reliable. The district court agreed and admitted the evidence. It then concluded that the government had established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Rondeau had assaulted Williams with a deadly weapon and was a felon unlawfully in possession of a firearm. The court imposed an additional twenty-four months of incarceration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rondeau argues that the presentation of hearsay evidence, through the testimony of Sergeant McKiernan, violated both his Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses, as recognized in <i>Crawford v. Washington,</i> 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), and his rights under Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.1(b)(2)(C). We begin with the constitutional question, which we consider de novo. <i>See United States v.

Even if Williams' and Estrada's statements constituted testimonial hearsay, we hold that <i>Crawford</i> does not apply to supervised release revocation proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Confrontation Clause provides defendants with the right to confront adverse witnesses \"[i]n criminal prosecutions.\" U.S. Const. amend. VI. The Supreme Court has long recognized that a parole revocation hearing, which for present purposes is analogous to a supervised release hearing, <i>see United States v. Correa-Torres,</i> 326 F.3d 18, 22 (1st Cir.2003), is <i>not</i> equivalent to \"a criminal prosecution.\" <i>Morrissey v. Brewer,</i> 408 U.S. 471, 480, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972). Therefore, \"the full panoply of rights due a defendant in such a proceeding does not apply to parole revocations.\" <i>Id.</i> Rather, the proceeding \"should be flexible enough to consider evidence including letter affidavits, and other material that would not be admissible in an adversary criminal trial.\" <i>Id.</i> at 489, 92 S.Ct. 2593.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given that the Confrontation Clause focuses on \"criminal prosecutions,\" we have not found the Clause to be applicable to post-conviction proceedings. <i>See United States v. Luciano,</i> 414 F.3d 174, 179 (1st Cir.2005) (holding that the Confrontation Clause does not apply to sentencing hearings); <i>see also United States v. Work,</i> 409 F.3d 484, 491 (1st Cir.2005) (\"The law is clear that once the original sentence has been imposed in a criminal case, further proceedings with respect to that sentence are not governed by Sixth Amendment protections.\"). Nothing in <i>Crawford</i> indicates that the Supreme Court intended to extend the Confrontation Clause's reach beyond the criminal prosecution context. <i>See Luciano,</i> 414 F.3d at 179; <i>United States v. Aspinall,</i> 389 F.3d 332, 342-43 (2d Cir.2004). We therefore join several other circuits in concluding that, because a supervised release revocation hearing is not a \"criminal prosecution,\" <i>Crawford</i> does not apply. <i>See Hall,</i> 419 F.3d 980, 985-86 (9th Cir.2005); <i>United States v. Kirby,</i> 418 F.3d 621, 627-28 (6th Cir.2005); <i>Aspinall,</i> 389 F.3d at 342-43; <i>United States v.

This Rule provides that a defendant subject to supervised release revocation \"is entitled to an opportunity to ... question any adverse witness unless the court determines that the interest of justice does not require the witness to appear....\" Fed. R. Crim P. 32.1(b)(2)(C).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Advisory Committee Notes to Rule 32.1(b)(2)(C) explain that a court should apply this Rule by balancing the releasee's right to confront witnesses with the government's good cause for denying confrontation. <i>See Taveras,</i> 380 F.3d at 536 (applying the relevant Advisory Committee Notes under similar circumstances). In conducting this analysis, a court should consider the reliability of the hearsay testimony and the government's reason for declining to produce the declarant. <i>See id.</i> at 536 (\"An important element of the good cause analysis is the reliability of the evidence that the Government seeks to introduce.\"); <i>Martin,</i> 382 F.3d at 845 (stating that a court should consider \"the explanation the government offers of why live testimony is undesirable or impracticable\") (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). We review the district court's decision to admit hearsay evidence under Rule 32.1(b)(2)(C) for an abuse of discretion. <i>See Taveras,</i> 380 F.3d at 536.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court was within its discretion in concluding that the hearsay evidence against Rondeau was reliable. First, Williams' and Estrada's 911 calls were made as or immediately after Rondeau threatened Williams with the gun. Given the volatility of the situation, these statements qualify as excited utterances. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 803(2); <i>United States v. Brito,</i> 427 F.3d 53, 62-63 (1st Cir.2005). Second, Williams' and Estrada's accounts of the assault were offered to the police separately, but were materially identical. <i>See United States v. Washington,</i> 38 Fed.Appx. 522, 524 (10th Cir.2002) (statements by two witnesses were considered reliable where the statements were given to the police separately but were consistent). Third, Williams and Estrada reduced their verbal statements to writing. <i>Compare United States v. Comito,</i> 177 F.3d 1166, 1171 (9th Cir.1999) (concluding that \"verbal allegations are ... the least reliable type of hearsay\") <i>with United States v. Pratt,</i> 52 F.3d 671, 677 (7th Cir.1995) (concluding that officer's hearsay testimony was reliable because it was consistent with the written statements of the victim). Fourth, McKiernan discussed the incident with Williams over a dozen times, and she never changed her description of the assault. <i>See Hall,</i> 419 F.3d at 987 (statement deemed reliable, in part, because declarant provided same account several times). Finally, the police corroborated Williams' statement by locating Rondeau near Williams' building in a car that matched Williams' description and in which they also discovered the gun that Williams later identified. <i>See United States v. Waters,</i> 158 F.3d 933, 941 (6th Cir.1998) (admitting hearsay statement of a co-conspirator at revocation hearing where the government had confirmed some of the details in the statement).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In challenging the district court's reliability determination, Rondeau relies on <i>Taveras.</i> That case does not help him. In <i>Taveras,</i> the government sought to introduce a hearsay statement from the victim of an alleged assault through the testimony of the releasee's probation officer. 380 F.3d at 535. The victim made the statement to the probation officer verbally, the day after the alleged incident, but later recanted in a written statement. <i>Id.</i> We concluded that the district court abused its discretion in deeming the victim's verbal statement reliable for three reasons: (1) the statement was not an excited utterance because the victim made it the day after the alleged assault; (2) the victim's statement was not reduced to writing and was later recanted; and (3) the probation officer had limited contact with the victim and therefore could not reasonably assess her credibility. <i>Id.</i> at 537-38. None of these factors is present here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn next to the adequacy of the government's reason for not presenting the declarants' live testimony. The government focused on Williams' concern about testifying, based in part on her knowledge of Rondeau's gang membership. McKiernan supported the government's approach by testifying that, in his discussions with Williams, she had expressed fear for her safety in the event she were to testify. This safety concern applied equally to Estrada, who also knew Rondeau and was only thirteen. Because the safety concern was supported by record evidence, it was within the district court's discretion to conclude that there was good reason for the declarants not to testify. <i>See United States v. Jones,</i> 299 F.3d 103, 113 (2d Cir.2002) (the government provided an adequate reason for not presenting the declarants to testify where the releasee's \"history of violent conduct made reprisal against them a possibility\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The hearsay evidence presented against Rondeau was reliable, and the government presented a sufficient reason for not calling the declarants to testify. Consequently, the district court did not abuse its discretion under Rule 32.1(b)(2)(C) in admitting the hearsay evidence at Rondeau's revocation hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rondeau also claims that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that he committed an assault or illegally possessed a firearm. We consider this argument de novo, taking the facts in the light most favorable to the government, to determine whether there was proof, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Rondeau violated his supervised release conditions. <i>See United States v. Portalla,</i> 985 F.2d 621, 622 (1st Cir.1993). Rondeau challenges the sufficiency of the evidence by discounting Williams' and Estrada's statements as unreliable and then claiming that the remaining evidence was insufficient. But, as discussed above, Williams' and Estrada's statements were properly considered and, when taken into account, there is no question that this evidence supports the conclusion that Rondeau assaulted Williams while illegally possessing a gun.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Under the relevant provisions of the United States Sentencing Guidelines, violations of supervised release are classified into three grades: A, B, and C.

Nothing in <i>Crawford</i> indicates that the Supreme Court intended to extend the Confrontation Clause's reach beyond the criminal prosecution context. <i>See Luciano,</i> 414 F.3d at 179; <i>United States v.

We therefore join several other circuits in concluding that, because a supervised release revocation hearing is not a \"criminal prosecution,\" <i>Crawford</i> does not apply. <i>See Hall,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791549\"><a href=\"/opinion/791549/united-states-v-william-lewis-hall/\"><span class=\"volume\">419</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">980</span></a></span>, 985-86 (9th Cir.2005); <i>United States v.

This Rule provides that a defendant subject to supervised release revocation \"is entitled to an opportunity to ... question any adverse witness unless the court determines that the interest of justice does not require the witness to appear....\" Fed. R. Crim P. 32.1(b)(2)(C).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Advisory Committee Notes to Rule 32.1(b)(2)(C) explain that a court should apply this Rule by balancing the releasee's right to confront witnesses with the government's good cause for denying confrontation. <i>See Taveras,</i> 380 F.3d at 536 (applying the relevant Advisory Committee Notes under similar circumstances). In conducting this analysis, a court should consider the reliability of the hearsay testimony and the government's reason for declining to produce the declarant. <i>See id.</i> at 536 (\"An important element of the good cause analysis is the reliability of the evidence that the Government seeks to introduce.\"); <i>Martin,</i> 382 F.3d at 845 (stating that a court should consider \"the explanation the government offers of why live testimony is undesirable or impracticable\") (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). We review the district court's decision to admit hearsay evidence under Rule 32.1(b)(2)(C) for an abuse of discretion. <i>See Taveras,</i> 380 F.3d at 536.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court was within its discretion in concluding that the hearsay evidence against Rondeau was reliable. First, Williams' and Estrada's 911 calls were made as or immediately after Rondeau threatened Williams with the gun. Given the volatility of the situation, these statements qualify as excited utterances. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 803(2); <i>United States v. Brito,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201867\"><a href=\"/opinion/201867/united-states-v-brito/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span>, 62-63 (1st Cir.2005). Second, Williams' and Estrada's accounts of the assault were offered to the police separately, but were materially identical. <i>See United States v. Washington,</i> 38 Fed.Appx. 522, 524 (10th Cir.2002) (statements by two witnesses were considered reliable where the statements were given to the police separately but were consistent). Third, Williams and Estrada reduced their verbal statements to writing. <i>Compare United States v. Comito,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1166</span></span>, 1171 (9th Cir.1999) (concluding that \"verbal allegations are ... the least reliable type of hearsay\") <i>with United States v. Pratt,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"694340\"><a href=\"/opinion/694340/united-states-v-anthony-pratt/\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">671</span></a></span>, 677 (7th Cir.1995) (concluding that officer's hearsay testimony was reliable because it was consistent with the written statements of the victim). Fourth, McKiernan discussed the incident with Williams over a dozen times, and she never changed her description of the assault. <i>See Hall,</i> 419 F.3d at 987 (statement deemed reliable, in part, because declarant provided same account several times). Finally, the police corroborated Williams' statement by locating Rondeau near Williams' building in a car that matched Williams' description and in which they also discovered the gun that Williams later identified. <i>See United States v. Waters,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"758685\"><a href=\"/opinion/758685/united-states-v-charles-c-waters/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">933</span></a></span>, 941 (6th Cir.1998) (admitting hearsay statement of a co-conspirator at revocation hearing where the government had confirmed some of the details in the statement).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In challenging the district court's reliability determination, Rondeau relies on <i>Taveras.</i> That case does not help him. In <i>Taveras,</i> the government sought to introduce a hearsay statement from the victim of an alleged assault through the testimony of the releasee's probation officer. 380 F.3d at 535. The victim made the statement to the probation officer verbally, the day after the alleged incident, but later recanted in a written statement. <i>Id.</i> We concluded that the district court abused its discretion in deeming the victim's verbal statement reliable for three reasons: (1) the statement was not an excited utterance because the victim made it the day after the alleged assault; (2) the victim's statement was not reduced to writing and was later recanted; and (3) the probation officer had limited contact with the victim and therefore could not reasonably assess her credibility. <i>Id.</i> at 537-38. None of these factors is present here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn next to the adequacy of the government's reason for not presenting the declarants' live testimony. The government focused on Williams' concern about testifying, based in part on her knowledge of Rondeau's gang membership. McKiernan supported the government's approach by testifying that, in his discussions with Williams, she had expressed fear for her safety in the event she were to testify. This safety concern applied equally to Estrada, who also knew Rondeau and was only thirteen. Because the safety concern was supported by record evidence, it was within the district court's discretion to conclude that there was good reason for the declarants not to testify. <i>See United States v. Jones,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778635\"><a href=\"/opinion/778635/united-states-v-larry-f-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">299</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></a></span>, 113 (2d Cir.2002) (the government provided an adequate reason for not presenting the declarants to testify where the releasee's \"history of violent conduct made reprisal against them a possibility\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The hearsay evidence presented against Rondeau was reliable, and the government presented a sufficient reason for not calling the declarants to testify. Consequently, the district court did not abuse its discretion under Rule 32.1(b)(2)(C) in admitting the hearsay evidence at Rondeau's revocation hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rondeau also claims that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that he committed an assault or illegally possessed a firearm. We consider this argument de novo, taking the facts in the light most favorable to the government, to determine whether there was proof, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Rondeau violated his supervised release conditions. <i>See United States v. Portalla,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600258\"><a href=\"/opinion/600258/united-states-v-vincent-m-portalla-aka-vincent-marino/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></a></span>, 622 (1st Cir.1993). Rondeau challenges the sufficiency of the evidence by discounting Williams' and Estrada's statements as unreliable and then claiming that the remaining evidence was insufficient. But, as discussed above, Williams' and Estrada's statements were properly considered and, when taken into account, there is no question that this evidence supports the conclusion that Rondeau assaulted Williams while illegally possessing a gun.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Under the relevant provisions of the United States Sentencing Guidelines, violations of supervised release are classified into three grades: A, B, and C.
