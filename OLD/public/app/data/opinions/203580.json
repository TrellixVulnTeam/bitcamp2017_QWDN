Joyce and Joyce & Associates P.C. for petitioner.\n     Gregory G. Katsas, Assistant Attorney General, Anthony W.\nNorwood, Senior Litigation Counsel, and Shahrzad Baghai, Trial\nAttorney, Office of Immigration Litigation, on brief for\nrespondent.\n\n\n\n                        December 5, 2008\n\f           HOWARD, Circuit Judge. The petitioner, Bahri Karam Khan,\n\na Pakistani national, seeks review of a Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals' (\"BIA\") final order upholding an Immigration Judge's\n\n(\"IJ\") denial of his applications for asylum, withholding of\n\nremoval, and protection under the United Nations Convention Against\n\nTorture (\"CAT\").   Discerning substantial evidence in the record to\n\nsupport the BIA's determination, we deny the petition for review.\n\n                               I. Background\n\n           Khan entered the United States on July 1, 2001 as a non-\n\nimmigrant visitor.     In late 2004, the Department of Homeland\n\nSecurity (\"DHS\") issued a Notice to Appear against Khan, charging\n\nhim with removability for overstaying his visa, in violation of 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1227(c).     Khan admitted the factual allegations but\n\ndenied removability and declined to designate a country of removal.\n\nHe also requested asylum, withholding of removal, and protection\n\nunder the CAT.   In March 2005, more than four years after his entry\n\ninto the United States, Khan filed an I-589 Application for Asylum\n\nand for Withholding of Removal.           In support of his application,\n\nKhan claimed that he suffered persecution in Pakistan on account of\n\nhis political opinion.         We summarize Khan's testimony at his\n\nsubsequent hearing before the Immigration Judge.\n\n           In January 1998, Khan joined the People's Party of\n\nPakistan   (\"PPP\").   As   a    member    of   this   political   party,   he\n\n\"arranged meetings\" and attended \"processions.\" On March 17, 1998,\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fKhan   attended   a   PPP   demonstration    near   the   city   of   Mingora,\n\nPakistan.    The police arrested seven people at the demonstration,\n\nincluding Khan, and warned them to \"stop working for [the] People's\n\nParty, not to talk against the government, and [to] join the\n\ngovernment party.\"       Khan was charged with speaking against the\n\ngovernment.    While in prison, Khan was beaten with wooden sticks\n\nand shocked with electrical wires.          He remained in prison for ten\n\ndays until his father posted bail.            Khan did not seek medical\n\ntreatment for any injuries he sustained in prison.\n\n            Following his release, Khan immediately left the Mingora\n\narea for other parts of Pakistan.         He spent thirteen months living\n\nin Karachi and three months in Lahore.        Khan next moved to the town\n\nof Swat, where his family resides.          Fearing that the police would\n\nfind him if he stayed in his family's home, Khan lived apart and\n\nvisited his family only at night.\n\n            After three months, he moved to Peshawar, where he joined\n\nthe crew of an oil tanker.      In April 2000, Khan left Pakistan on a\n\nship which docked in Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.             At\n\neach of these ports, Khan disembarked the ship.           In December 2000,\n\nKhan returned to Pakistan.       In July 2001, he obtained a C-1 visa\n\nand traveled, again as a member of the ship's crew, to the United\n\nStates.   When questioned by his counsel as to why he did not return\n\nto Pakistan with his fellow crew members, Khan responded that the\n\nship departed without his knowledge, and he could not afford to\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fpurchase a return ticket.   On cross-examination, Khan acknowledged\n\nthat he intended to return to Pakistan when he first arrived in the\n\nUnited States.     His parents, wife and three children continue to\n\nreside in Swat, Pakistan.\n\n          As previously noted, in March 2005, four years after\n\narriving in the United States, Khan applied for asylum, withholding\n\nof removal and withholding under CAT.\n\n          The IJ denied Khan's applications and granted his request\n\nfor voluntary departure.    The IJ ruled that the asylum application\n\nwas time-barred and Khan did not qualify for an exception.1   The IJ\n\nrejected the CAT claim for failure to establish harm amounting to\n\ntorture under the Convention.2    Khan does not pursue these claims\n\nin his petition.\n\n           In support of the conclusion that Khan was ineligible\n\nfor withholding of removal, the IJ found that Khan failed to\n\ndemonstrate either past persecution or a likelihood of future\n\n\n1\n An application for asylum must be filed within one year of the\nalien's arrival in the United States, absent changed circumstances\naffecting eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances\nrelating to the delay in filing. 8 U.S.C. §§ 1158(a)(2)(B);\n1158(a)(2)(D).\n2\n To qualify for withholding of removal under the CAT, an applicant\nmust establish that it is \"more likely than not that [he] . . .\nwould be tortured if removed\" to Pakistan. Limani v. Mukasey, 538\nF.3d 25, 32 (1st Cir. 2008)(quoting 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(c)(2)).\n\"'Torture' means 'severe pain or suffering, whether physical or\nmental . . . inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the\nconsent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting\nin    an   official    capacity.'\"    Id.   (quoting    8    C.F.R.\n208.18(a)(1))(alteration in original).\n\n                                 -4-\n\fpersecution.      Taking Khan's factual testimony to be true, yet\n\ndoubting   some   specific   details,    the   IJ   determined   that     the\n\nmistreatment Khan received in prison was not so severe as to\n\nconstitute persecution.      The IJ found that Khan did not require\n\neven   \"rudimentary   medical   intervention,\"      and   Khan   failed   to\n\nestablish that he was arrested for his political activities.\n\nSpecifically, the IJ noted that Khan was only a member of the party\n\nfor three months prior to his arrest, and he was not a principal\n\nspeaker at the PPP meeting.      The IJ further concluded that Khan's\n\nacknowledged intent to return to Pakistan, the infrequency of his\n\npolitical activities, and Pakistani authorities' seeming lack of\n\ninterest in arresting him again, undercut his claim of future\n\npersecution.\n\n           The BIA affirmed, expressly agreeing with most of the\n\nIJ's findings.      The BIA concluded that the IJ did not err in\n\nfinding that Khan failed to prove past persecution, stating that\n\nhis alleged arrest and mistreatment by the police did not rise to\n\nthe level of persecution. The BIA also agreed with the IJ's\n\ndetermination that the evidence did not support a finding of future\n\npersecution, considering that Khan remained unharmed in Pakistan\n\nfor three years following his arrest, and that his family continued\n\nto live safely in Pakistan.     The BIA also stated that Khan's return\n\nto Pakistan, after traveling to several countries of safe haven,\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fundermined       his   claim.     The    BIA   permitted     Khan    to   depart\n\nvoluntarily.      This petition followed.\n\n                                 II. Discussion\n\n            We    review   the   BIA's   decision    under   the    deferential\n\n\"substantial evidence\" standard, reversing only if a \"reasonable\n\nadjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\"                   8\n\nU.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B); see also Pan v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 60, 61\n\n(1st Cir. 2006).       Under this standard, the BIA's decision will be\n\nupheld if supported by \"reasonable, substantial, and probative\n\nevidence on the record considered as a whole.\" Carcamo-Recinos v.\n\nAshcroft, 389 F.3d 253, 256 (1st Cir. 2004) (internal quotation\n\nomitted).\n\n            To qualify for withholding of removal, an applicant has\n\nthe burden to prove that his \"life or freedom would be threatened\n\nin   the   destination     country   because    of   [his]   race,    religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\nopinion.\" 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(b); see also 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A).\n\nTo satisfy this burden, the applicant must either prove past\n\npersecution, which gives rise to a rebuttable presumption of future\n\npersecution, or show that it is \"more likely than not\" that he will\n\nface future persecution based on one of the statutory grounds.\n\nLimani, 538 F.3d at 31 (citing 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(b)(1)(i),(b)(2)).\n\nIn other words, the alien must prove a \"clear probability\" of\n\npersecution in the country to which removal is proposed.                  INS v.\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fStevic, 467 U.S. 407, 430 (1984); Ang v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 50, 58\n\n(1st Cir. 2005); see also Limani, 538 F.3d at 31.\n\n             Although the alleged mistreatment Khan experienced is\n\nobjectionable, our deferential standard of review does not permit\n\nus to second-guess the determinations of the BIA, if they are\n\nsupported by substantial evidence in the record.                See Bocova v.\n\nGonzales, 412 F.3d 257, 263 (1st Cir. 2005).                The substantial\n\nevidence standard demands that we uphold the agency's determination\n\nunless the evidence \"points unerringly in the opposite direction.\"\n\nLaurent v. Ashcroft, 359 F.3d 59, 64 (1st Cir. 2004) (citing INS v.\n\nElias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 & n.1 (1992)).                   Here, the\n\nevidence does not compel us to reject the BIA's conclusion.                 See\n\nElias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. at 481 n.1.\n\n             Substantial evidence in the record supports the finding\n\nthat Khan has proved neither past persecution nor a likelihood of\n\nfuture persecution.        An important factor in determining whether\n\nalleged incidents rise to the level of persecution is whether \"the\n\nmistreatment can be said to be systematic rather than reflective of\n\na   series   of    isolated   incidents.\"       Bocova,   412   F.3d   at   263.\n\nMoreover, \"[t]o qualify as persecution, a person's experience must\n\nrise above unpleasantness, harassment, and even basic suffering.\"\n\nNelson v. INS, 232 F.3d 258, 263 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n                  The   record   supports   a    conclusion     that    Khan's\n\nmistreatment was an isolated event; the only incident to which Khan\n\n                                     -7-\n\ftestified occurred in March 1998. That fact alone is sufficient to\n\nsupport the finding that Khan was not persecuted.                    See, e.g.,\n\nJournal v. Keisler, 507 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir. 2007) (alien did not\n\nsuffer persecution where he \"alleged only one incident of violence\n\nin which he was struck on the head and arms\"); Attia v. Gonzales,\n\n477 F.3d 21, 23-24 (1st Cir. 2007)(\"two altercations in a nine-year\n\nperiod and a general climate of discrimination\" do not suffice as\n\npast     persecution);   Nelson,       232   F.3d    at    264    (three     brief\n\nincarcerations in solitary confinement, physical abuse during each\n\nincarceration, along with surveillance and harassment did not\n\nconstitute persecution).\n\n            The BIA's rejection of Khan's past persecution claim\n\ndraws further support from the fact that Khan provided little\n\ninformation regarding the duration or severity of the beatings he\n\nreceived. It was Khan's \"burden to provide us with specifics of the\n\ncircumstances of his maltreatment, which only he has knowledge of,\n\nin order to compel us to find for him.\"             Topalli v. Gonzales, 417\n\nF.3d 128, 132 n.5 (1st Cir. 2005).            Moreover, as the BIA noted,\n\nKhan's    injuries   were   not   so    serious     that   he    sought    medical\n\nattention.\n\n            On these facts, we are not compelled to conclude that\n\nKhan was subjected to systematic abuse rising to the level of\n\npersecution. This result is consistent with other cases presenting\n\ncomparable facts.    See, e.g., id. at 132 (seven arrests over a two-\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fyear period, accompanied by brief detentions and beatings which did\n\nnot require medical treatment, did not rise to the level of\n\npersecution); Bocova, 412 F.3d at 263 (finding no persecution where\n\npetitioner was arrested, threatened with death twice over an eight-\n\nyear period, and was so severely beaten that he lost consciousness\n\nand was hospitalized); Ravindran v. INS, 976 F.2d 754, 756-60 (1st\n\nCir. 1992) (persecution not found where ethnic minority member had\n\nbeen    interrogated    and   beaten    for   three    days   in    prison   after\n\nparticipating in a political protest); cf. Desir v. Ilchert 840\n\nF.2d 723, 729 (9th Cir. 1988) (\"successive and specific threats\" to\n\npetitioner's life and \"beatings, arrests and assaults\" in the\n\ncontext of ongoing extortion by Haitian police was sufficient to\n\nestablish past persecution).          A dictionary reading layperson might\n\nthink    a   police   beating   for    expressing     political     views    to   be\n\npersecution, but in the ordinary case precedent calls for something\n\nlike a pattern or prolonged period of events and not a single\n\nspecific event, objectionable though it may be.\n\n             Having failed to establish past persecution, Khan is not\n\nentitled to a presumption of further persecution.                  See 8 C.F.R. §\n\n208.16(b)(1)(i).       As to future persecution, substantial evidence\n\nsupports the conclusion that Khan has failed to prove it was \"more\n\nlikely than not\" he would be persecuted on account of his political\n\nbeliefs if he should return to Pakistan.              See Limani, 538 F.3d at\n\n31; 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(b)(2).\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\f          As noted by the BIA, the continued safety of Khan's\n\nparents, wife and children, who still live in Pakistan, undercuts\n\nKhan's argument that he would suffer persecution if he returned.\n\nSee, e.g., Ferdinandus v. Gonzales, 504 F.3d 61, 63 (1st Cir.\n\n2007); Melhem v. Gonzales, 500 F.3d 78, 82 (1st Cir. 2007); Ouk v.\n\nGonzales, 464 F.3d 108, 111 (1st Cir. 2006). Khan himself remained\n\nin Pakistan for the better part of three years without incident.\n\nAdditionally, Khan left Pakistan in April 2000 and returned in\n\nDecember 2000, despite having visited several countries in which he\n\ncould have found refuge.   See Diab v. Ashcroft, 397 F.3d 35, 42\n\n(1st Cir. 2005) (petitioner's trips to countries of safe haven\n\nafter the alleged incidents of his persecution \"significantly\n\nundercut his claim that he is now afraid to return.\").    Finally,\n\nalthough the BIA did not expressly rely on this fact, Khan admitted\n\nthat he intended to re-board the ship to Pakistan when he first\n\narrived in the United States, but did not return to Pakistan only\n\nbecause the ship left without him.\n\n          This evidence substantially supports the BIA's decision.\n\nThe petition is therefore denied.\n\nSo Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -10-\n\f",

Discerning substantial evidence in the record to support the BIA's determination, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Background</h2>\n<p>Khan entered the United States on July 1, 2001 as a non-immigrant visitor. In late 2004, the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") issued a Notice to Appear against Khan, charging him with removability for overstaying his visa, in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1227(c).

In March 2005, more than four years after his entry into the United States, Khan filed an I-589 Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal. In support of his application, Khan claimed that he suffered persecution in Pakistan on account of his political opinion. We summarize Khan's testimony at his subsequent hearing before the Immigration Judge.</p>\n<p>In January 1998, Khan joined the People's Party of Pakistan (\"PPP\"). As a member of this political party, he \"arranged meetings\" and attended \"processions.\" On March 17, 1998, Khan attended a PPP demonstration near the city of Mingora, Pakistan.

Taking Khan's factual testimony to be true, yet doubting some specific details, the IJ determined that the mistreatment Khan received in prison was not so severe as to constitute persecution. The IJ found that Khan did not require even \"rudimentary medical intervention,\" and Khan failed to establish that he was arrested for his political activities. Specifically, the IJ noted that Khan was only a member of the party for three months prior to his arrest, and he was not a principal speaker at the PPP meeting.

Moreover, \"[t]o qualify as persecution, a person's experience must rise above unpleasantness, harassment, and even basic suffering.\" <i>Nelson v. INS,</i> 232 F.3d 258, 263 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n<p>The record supports a conclusion that Khan's mistreatment was an isolated event; the only incident to which Khan <span class=\"star-pagination\">*577</span> testified occurred in March 1998. That fact alone is sufficient to support the finding that Khan was not persecuted. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Journal v. Keisler,</i> 507 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir.2007) (alien did not suffer persecution where he \"alleged only one incident of violence in which he was struck on the head and arms\"); <i>Attia v.

A dictionary reading layperson might think a police beating for expressing political views to be persecution, but in the ordinary case precedent calls for something like a pattern or prolonged period of events and not a single specific event, objectionable though it may be.</p>\n<p>Having failed to establish past persecution, Khan is not entitled to a presumption of further persecution. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(b)(1)(i).

Norwood, Senior Litigation Counsel, and Shahrzad Baghai, Trial Attorney, Office of Immigration Litigation, on brief, for respondent.</p>\n<p>Before TORRUELLA, BOUDIN and HOWARD, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>HOWARD, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>The petitioner, Bahri Karam Khan, a Pakistani national, seeks review of a Board of Immigration Appeals' (\"BIA\") final order upholding an Immigration Judge's (\"IJ\") denial of his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\"). Discerning substantial evidence in the record to support the BIA's determination, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Background</h2>\n<p>Khan entered the United States on July 1, 2001 as a non-immigrant visitor. In late 2004, the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") issued a Notice to Appear against Khan, charging him with removability for overstaying his visa, in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1227(c). Khan admitted the factual allegations but denied removability and declined to designate a country of removal. He also requested asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT. In March 2005, more than four years after his entry into the United States, Khan filed an I-589 Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal. In support of his application, Khan claimed that he suffered persecution in Pakistan on account of his political opinion. We summarize Khan's testimony at his subsequent hearing before the Immigration Judge.</p>\n<p>In January 1998, Khan joined the People's Party of Pakistan (\"PPP\"). As a member of this political party, he \"arranged meetings\" and attended \"processions.\" On March 17, 1998, Khan attended a PPP demonstration near the city of Mingora, Pakistan. The police arrested seven people at the demonstration, including Khan, and warned them to \"stop working for [the] People's Party, not to talk against the government, and [to] join the government <span class=\"star-pagination\">*575</span> party.\" Khan was charged with speaking against the government. While in prison, Khan was beaten with wooden sticks and shocked with electrical wires. He remained in prison for ten days until his father posted bail. Khan did not seek medical treatment for any injuries he sustained in prison.</p>\n<p>Following his release, Khan immediately left the Mingora area for other parts of Pakistan. He spent thirteen months living in Karachi and three months in Lahore. Khan next moved to the town of Swat, where his family resides. Fearing that the police would find him if he stayed in his family's home, Khan lived apart and visited his family only at night.</p>\n<p>After three months, he moved to Peshawar, where he joined the crew of an oil tanker. In April 2000, Khan left Pakistan on a ship which docked in Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. At each of these ports, Khan disembarked the ship. In December 2000, Khan returned to Pakistan. In July 2001, he obtained a C-1 visa and traveled, again as a member of the ship's crew, to the United States. When questioned by his counsel as to why he did not return to Pakistan with his fellow crew members, Khan responded that the ship departed without his knowledge, and he could not afford to purchase a return ticket. On cross-examination, Khan acknowledged that he intended to return to Pakistan when he first arrived in the United States. His parents, wife and three children continue to reside in Swat, Pakistan.</p>\n<p>As previously noted, in March 2005, four years after arriving in the United States, Khan applied for asylum, withholding of removal and withholding under CAT.</p>\n<p>The IJ denied Khan's applications and granted his request for voluntary departure. The IJ ruled that the asylum application was time-barred and Khan did not qualify for an exception.<sup>[1]</sup> The IJ rejected the CAT claim for failure to establish harm amounting to torture under the Convention.<sup>[2]</sup> Khan does not pursue these claims in his petition.</p>\n<p>In support of the conclusion that Khan was ineligible for withholding of removal, the IJ found that Khan failed to demonstrate either past persecution or a likelihood of future persecution. Taking Khan's factual testimony to be true, yet doubting some specific details, the IJ determined that the mistreatment Khan received in prison was not so severe as to constitute persecution. The IJ found that Khan did not require even \"rudimentary medical intervention,\" and Khan failed to establish that he was arrested for his political activities. Specifically, the IJ noted that Khan was only a member of the party for three months prior to his arrest, and he was not a principal speaker at the PPP meeting. The IJ further concluded that Khan's acknowledged intent to return to Pakistan, the infrequency of his political activities, and Pakistani authorities' seeming lack of interest in arresting him again, undercut his claim of future persecution.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*576</span> The BIA affirmed, expressly agreeing with most of the IJ's findings. The BIA concluded that the IJ did not err in finding that Khan failed to prove past persecution, stating that his alleged arrest and mistreatment by the police did not rise to the level of persecution. The BIA also agreed with the IJ's determination that the evidence did not support a finding of future persecution, considering that Khan remained unharmed in Pakistan for three years following his arrest, and that his family continued to live safely in Pakistan. The BIA also stated that Khan's return to Pakistan, after traveling to several countries of safe haven, undermined his claim. The BIA permitted Khan to depart voluntarily. This petition followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.
