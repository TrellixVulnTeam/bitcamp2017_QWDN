The Bard of Avon once\n\nwarned that \"delays have dangerous ends.\" William Shakespeare, The\n\nFirst Part of King Henry the Sixth act 3, sc. 2.             This case, in\n\nwhich the plaintiffs procrastinated for the better part of three\n\nyears and cavalierly flouted the discovery deadlines announced by\n\nthe district court, bears out that admonition.           The tale follows.\n\n           The pertinent facts are easily summarized.           The sixty-\n\nfour plaintiffs claim to be members of the New Progressive Party\n\n(NPP).     In the turn-of-the-century general election, held in\n\nNovember of 2000, the NPP lost control of Puerto Rico's central\n\ngovernment and its main rival, the Popular Democratic Party (PDP),\n\nascended to power.     A new administration took office in January of\n\n2001.\n\n           As part and parcel of this changing of the guard, Cesár\n\nRey-Hernández (Rey) became Secretary of the Puerto Rico Department\n\nof Education (DOE).     He, in turn, appointed José Aldanondo-Rivera\n\n(Aldanondo) to head up the DOE's adult education program (AEP) and\n\nSantos Meléndez as the AEP's general supervisor.          All of these men\n\nhad ties to the PDP.\n\n           Prior to the 2001-2002 school year, the plaintiffs were\n\nemployed   by   the   AEP   under   serial   one-year   contracts.   Those\n\ncontracts were not renewed for the 2001-2002 school year.             When\n\nthat happened, the plaintiffs sued Rey, Aldanondo, and Meléndez in\n\nthe federal district court.         Invoking 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and various\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fprovisions of Puerto Rico's civil code, they chiefly alleged\n\npolitical discrimination.   See, e.g., Branti v. Finkel, 445 U.S.\n\n507, 515-16 (1980); Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976).\n\n          From our coign of vantage, the travel of the case is more\n\nimportant than the details of the plaintiffs' substantive claims.\n\nConsequently, we do not dwell on their allegations but, rather,\n\nlimn the relevant procedural history.   This is the chronology:\n\n                 1.   June 23, 2003.    The plaintiffs\n          commenced their civil action.\n\n                 2.   August 19, 2004.    The district\n          court issued a case-management order that,\n          among other things, required discovery to be\n          completed by January 15, 2005.\n\n                 3.   August 30, 2004.   The plaintiffs\n          filed an amended complaint designed to add the\n          nine regional directors of the AEP as\n          additional defendants.    The district court\n          issued summonses to be served on the regional\n          directors by September 20, 2004.\n\n                  4. February 21, 2005. The plaintiffs\n          (who   had  not   yet  served  the  regional\n          directors) moved for re-issuance of the now-\n          expired summonses.\n\n                 5. March 3, 2005. With the discovery\n          deadline already in the rear-view mirror, the\n          plaintiffs requested an additional period of\n          between 30 and 50 days within which to conduct\n          discovery.\n\n                 6.   March 22, 2005.    The plaintiffs\n          sent written depositions to the regional\n          directors without subpoenaing them even though\n          the regional directors had never been served\n          with summonses or otherwise made parties to\n          the case.\n\n\n\n                               -3-\n\f                  7. April 7, 2005. The district court\n          refused to re-issue summonses for the regional\n          directors (see Item No. 4, supra), calling the\n          plaintiffs' failure to serve them in a timely\n          manner \"inexcusable\" and \"negligent.\"      The\n          court also denied the plaintiffs' request to\n          reopen the discovery period (see Item No. 5,\n          supra).    In its order, the court left the\n          parties free to conduct consensual discovery,\n          but warned that it \"will not entertain any\n          disputes regarding . . . discovery\" and that\n          \"[no]    deadlines  or  settings   [will]   be\n          changed.\"\n\n                 8.     July 29, 2005.       Citing the\n          dismissal of a federal discrimination claim in\n          another case involving the AEP,1 the district\n          court gave the defendants until September 30,\n          2005 (later extended until October 24, 2005)\n          to file dispositive motions. The court gave\n          the plaintiffs until November 30, 2005 to file\n          oppositions to any such motions.\n\n                 9. October 23, 2005. The defendants\n          filed a motion for summary judgment.\n\n                 10. October 25, 2005. The plaintiffs\n          requested an additional period (until January\n          20, 2006) within which to oppose the summary\n          judgment motion.\n\n                 11.   November 8, 2005.   The district\n          court granted the plaintiffs their requested\n          extension to file an opposition to the summary\n          judgment motion (see Item No. 10, supra). The\n          court   warned   explicitly  that   \"no   more\n          extensions will be allowed.\"\n\n                 12. January 18, 2006. Notwithstanding\n          the district court's express caveat (see Item\n          No. 11, supra), the plaintiffs requested a\n          further extension, until March 20, 2006, for\n\n\n     1\n      The decision that the district court cited was recently\naffirmed on appeal. See Hatfield-Bermudez v. Aldanondo-Rivera, ___\nF.3d ___ (1st Cir. 2007) [2007 WL 2231623]. It has no bearing on\nthe issues before us.\n\n                               -4-\n\ffiling an opposition to the summary judgment\nmotion.\n\n       13.   March 3, 2006.   The plaintiffs\nsubpoenaed documents held by Rey's successor\nas Secretary of Education, Rafael Aragunde\n(not a party to the action).     Among other\nthings, the subpoena sought a list of all\nschool directors and other employees of the\nAEP during the 2000-2001 and 2001-2002\nacademic years. The plaintiffs never received\nthe list and the defendants deny that such a\nlist ever existed.\n\n       14.   March 7, 2006.    The plaintiffs\nfiled yet another motion for an extension of\ntime to respond to the summary judgment\nmotion. This time, they invoked Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 56(f) and professed a need for more\ndiscovery in order to oppose summary judgment.\nIn an accompanying memorandum, their attorney\nclaimed that he needed to depose the regional\ndirectors before composing such an opposition.\n\n       15.   March 23, 2006. The defendants\nrequested that the court deem their summary\njudgment motion unopposed.\n\n       16.   April 5, 2006. The case was\ntransferred to the calendar of a newly\nappointed district judge.\n\n       17. May 31, 2006. The district court\ndenied as moot the plaintiffs' January 18,\n2006 request for an extension of time within\nwhich to oppose the summary judgment motion\n(see Item No. 12, supra).\n\n       18. August 14, 2006. Pursuant to the\nfilling of yet another judicial vacancy, the\ncase was again transferred to the calendar of\na newly-appointed district judge.\n\n       19.   August 17, 2006.    The district\ncourt denied the Rule 56(f) motion (see Item\nNo. 14, supra) and granted the defendants'\nentreaty to deem the summary motion unopposed\n(see Item No. 15, supra).\n\n                     -5-\n\f                     20.   August 23, 2006.   Discerning no\n              genuine issue as to any material fact, the\n              district court (Gelpí, J.) entered summary\n              judgment in favor of the defendants.\n\n              This timely appeal ensued.          In it, the plaintiffs assail\n\nthe district court's refusal to grant further extensions of the\n\ndiscovery deadline; its decision to deem the summary judgment\n\nmotion unopposed; and its subsequent entry of summary judgment.\n\n              For the most part, these claims of error are so weak as\n\nnot to warrant extended discussion.              The district court exhibited\n\ngreat patience with the plaintiffs, warned them explicitly that\n\ncontinued noncompliance would have consequences, and took final\n\naction      only   when   the   plaintiffs      had    piled   delay   upon   delay.\n\n\"[C]ourts — like the deity — are more prone to help those who help\n\nthemselves,\" Williams v. Drake, 146 F.3d 44, 50 (1st Cir. 1998),\n\nand   the     plaintiffs,       through   their       indolence,   forfeited     any\n\nplausible claim to further indulgences.\n\n              The one point that merits elaboration is the plaintiffs'\n\nattempt to invoke Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f).2                     We turn\n\n\n      2\n          The rule states:\n\n              Should it appear from the affidavits of a\n              party opposing the motion [for summary\n              judgment] that the party cannot for reasons\n              stated present by affidavit facts essential to\n              justify the party's opposition, the court may\n              refuse the application for judgment or may\n              order a continuance to permit affidavits to be\n              obtained or depositions to be taken or\n              discovery to be had or may make such other\n              order as is just.\n\n                                          -6-\n\fto the district court's ruling on that issue, mindful that a\n\ndistrict court's denial of a Rule 56(f) motion is reviewed on\n\nappeal solely for abuse of discretion.                See, e.g., Mass. Sch. of\n\nLaw at Andover, Inc. v. Am. Bar Ass'n, 142 F.3d 26, 44 (1st Cir.\n\n1998).\n\n            We begin with bedrock: Rule 56(f) serves a salutary\n\npurpose within the summary judgment framework.                     When a party\n\nconfronted by a motion for summary judgment legitimately needs\n\nadditional    time   to   marshal   the       facts    necessary   to   mount    an\n\nopposition,    the   rule   provides      a    useful    safety    valve.       See\n\nResolution Trust Corp. v. N. Bridge Assocs., Inc., 22 F.3d 1198,\n\n1203 (1st Cir. 1994).       Deployed appropriately, \"[t]he rule . . .\n\nsafeguard[s] against judges swinging the summary judgment axe too\n\nhastily.\"    Id.\n\n            Be that as it may, the prophylaxis of Rule 56(f) is not\n\navailable merely for the asking.          A litigant who seeks to invoke\n\nthe rule must act with due diligence to show that his predicament\n\nfits within its confines. To that end, the litigant must submit to\n\nthe trial court an affidavit or other authoritative document\n\nshowing (i) good cause for his inability to have discovered or\n\nmarshalled the necessary facts earlier in the proceedings; (ii) a\n\nplausible basis for believing that additional facts probably exist\n\nand can be retrieved within a reasonable time; and (iii) an\n\nexplanation of how those facts, if collected, will suffice to\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fdefeat the pending summary judgment motion.    See Vélez v. Awning\n\nWindows, Inc., 375 F.3d 35, 40 (1st Cir. 2004); Paterson-Leitch Co.\n\nv. Mass. Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co., 840 F.2d 985, 988 (1st Cir.\n\n1998).\n\n          We add a further caveat: Rule 56(f) is not designed to\n\ngive relief to those who sleep upon their rights. See Ayala-Gerena\n\nv. Bristol Myers-Squibb Co., 95 F.3d 86, 92 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\nConsequently, a party seeking to derive the benefit of Rule 56(f)\n\nmust demonstrate due diligence both in conducting discovery before\n\nthe emergence of the summary judgment motion and in pursuing an\n\nextension of time once the motion has surfaced.     See Resolution\n\nTrust, 22 F.3d at 1203.\n\n          Viewed through this prism, we do not think that the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion in denying the plaintiffs'\n\nRule 56(f) motion.   In the first place, the plaintiffs' proffer\n\nfell far short of the requisite showing.   In the second place, the\n\nplaintiffs' conduct, both before and after the emergence of the\n\nsummary judgment motion, was characterized by the polar opposite of\n\ndue diligence.   We explain briefly.\n\n          To begin, the plaintiffs' Rule 56(f) motion failed to\n\nshow good cause for their professed inability to conduct the\n\ndesired discovery at an earlier date.   The district court afforded\n\nthe parties a reasonable interval for pretrial discovery — they had\n\n\n\n\n                                -8-\n\falmost 18 months from the inception of the action — and, for aught\n\nthat appears, the plaintiffs simply frittered the time away.\n\n            This is not to say that the plaintiffs are short on\n\nexcuses;    they   variously    blame      the   defendants'   uncooperative\n\nattitude during discovery, the regional directors' evasiveness, the\n\ntransfer of the case from judge to judge, and what they perceive as\n\na gadarene rush to judgment in the summer of 2006.             But once past\n\nthe plaintiffs' rhetorical flourishes, the frailty of these excuses\n\nbecomes readily apparent.       None of them shows good cause for the\n\nplaintiffs' inordinate delay.\n\n            The claim that the defendants disrupted the discovery\n\nprocess is belied by the plaintiffs' abject failure to use the\n\navailable means of discovery during the generous discovery period\n\nallowed by the district court.          Indeed, the plaintiffs' claim of\n\ndisruption centers on something that occurred after the close of\n\nformal discovery and during the subsequent period of consensual\n\ndiscovery permitted by the district court (see Item No. 8, supra):\n\nthe defendants' refusal to hand over a list of AEP directors and\n\nemployees   for    the   2000-2001   and    2001-2002   school   years.   In\n\naddition to an obvious lack of timeliness, this claim suffers from\n\nno fewer than three major infirmities: the plaintiffs have not\n\nshown that such a list existed, nor have they shown that they could\n\nnot have compiled such a list themselves from the copious documents\n\ntransmitted to them in the discovery process, nor have they shown\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fthat   they    seasonably       availed    themselves   of   any    of    the     usual\n\nremedies for a failure of production during the discovery period.\n\nSee, e.g., Fed. R. Civ. P. 37.\n\n              In all events, the list had no direct bearing on the\n\nplaintiffs' ability to conduct the discovery sought in their Rule\n\n56(f) motion: the depositions of the regional directors.                        Those\n\ndepositions could (and should) have been taken in a timely manner\n\nregardless of the availability of the evanescent list.\n\n              Much the same can be said about the plaint that the\n\nregional directors' failure to answer the written depositions\n\naddressed     to   them    handicapped       the   plaintiffs.           First,    the\n\nplaintiffs' appellate brief conspicuously fails to justify why they\n\nfailed   to    submit     the    written    depositions      (and   subpoena        the\n\nwitnesses, if necessary) within the discovery period.                        Second,\n\nnotwithstanding the regional directors' lack of cooperation, the\n\nplaintiffs inexplicably waited an entire year before asking the\n\ncourt for additional discovery vis-à-vis the regional directors.\n\n              This brings us to the plaintiffs' importuning that the\n\ntransfer of the case from judge to judge, together with Judge\n\nGelpí's prompt adjudication of outstanding motions once the case\n\nwas assigned to his calendar, unfairly surprised them.                             This\n\nimportuning rings hollow.           Parties have no vested right to have\n\ntheir cases heard by a particular judge.                See United States v.\n\nColon-Munoz, 292 F.3d 18, 22 (1st Cir. 2002); Sinito v. United\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\fStates, 750 F.2d 512, 515 (6th Cir. 1984).         And to deem the court's\n\nadjudication \"hasty\" is ludicrous.              Nearly ten months passed\n\nbetween the filing of the defendants' motion for summary judgment\n\nand the granting of the defendants' request to deem that motion\n\nunopposed. That hardly can be characterized as a rush to judgment.\n\nCf. D.P.R.R. 7(b) (allowing ten days within which to respond to\n\nmotions).\n\n            To cinch matters, the district court explicitly warned\n\nthe plaintiffs in November of 2005 that no further extensions of\n\ntime would be permitted in connection with the pending summary\n\njudgment motion.      See Item No. 11, supra.       Given this aposematic\n\nstatement,    the   plaintiffs   had    every    reason   to    believe   that\n\ncontinued inattention to the summary judgment motion would prove\n\nproblematic.      Parties ought to expect that courts will say what\n\nthey mean and mean what they say.             See, e.g., Torres v. Puerto\n\nRico, 485 F.3d 5, 10 (1st Cir. 2007).            Seen in this light, the\n\ndistrict court's disposition of the motion in August of 2006 could\n\nnot have come as a surprise.\n\n            At the expense of carting coal to Newcastle, we add that\n\nthe plaintiffs also failed to satisfy the second and third elements\n\nof   the   Rule   56(f)   standard.     The   motion   papers    disclose   no\n\nplausible basis for a belief that deposing the regional directors\n\nwould lead to material facts that might defeat summary judgment.\n\nTo the contrary, the motion is wholly conclusory; it merely states\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fthat \"the information that could be obtained from the regional\n\ndirectors' depositions [is] essential\" to crafting an opposition to\n\nthe summary judgment motion.     Speculative conclusions, unanchored\n\nin facts, are not sufficient to ground a Rule 56(f) motion.             See,\n\ne.g., Vargas-Ruiz v.

The plaintiffs\n\nwere afforded ample time within which to conduct discovery.             They\n\nwere given one extension and warned that no further extensions\n\nwould be forthcoming.    In all, a full twenty-eight months passed\n\nbetween the commencement of the action and the filing of the\n\nsummary judgment motion.     We think it significant that, early on,\n\nthe plaintiffs recognized the potential importance of the regional\n\ndirectors; after all, they attempted to amend their complaint to\n\nadd the regional directors as defendants on August 30, 2004 (see\n\nItem No. 3, supra).     At that point in time, the discovery period\n\nwas still open and the summary judgment motion was more than a year\n\nfrom being filed.    The plaintiffs nonetheless neglected to secure\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fthe regional directors' testimony during the time allotted for\n\npretrial discovery.\n\n            Even after the defendants moved for summary judgment, the\n\nplaintiffs dragged their feet: they lollygagged more than five\n\nmonths before filing their Rule 56(f) motion and announcing their\n\nprofessed need to depose the regional directors.       That was too\n\nlittle and too late: Rule 56(f) is meant to minister to the\n\nvigilant, not to those who sleep upon perceptible rights.\n\n            On this record, we conclude without serious question that\n\nthe district court acted within the realm of its discretion in\n\ndenying the plaintiffs' Rule 56(f) motion.3   Relatedly, we conclude\n\nthat the court, faced with a summary judgment motion that had been\n\npending for nearly ten months without a substantive response, acted\n\nwithin its discretion in deeming that motion unopposed. See Vélez,\n\n375 F.3d at 41.\n\n            That brings us to the merits of the motion for summary\n\njudgment.   We have reviewed that motion and the supporting papers,\n\nmindful that even an unopposed motion for summary judgment should\n\nnot be granted unless the record discloses that there is no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to\n\n\n     3\n      As an added justification for their failure to oppose the\nmotion for summary judgment in a timely manner, the plaintiffs\nallude to their counsel's poor health.

This case, in which the plaintiffs procrastinated for the better part of three years and cavalierly flouted the discovery deadlines announced by the district court, bears out that admonition. The tale follows.</p>\n<p>The pertinent facts are easily summarized. The sixty-four plaintiffs claim to be members of the New Progressive Party (NPP). In the turn-of-the-century general election, held in November of 2000, the NPP lost control of Puerto Rico's central government and its main rival, the Popular Democratic Party (PDP), ascended to power. A new administration took office in January of 2001.</p>\n<p>As part and parcel of this changing of the guard, Cesár Rey-Hernández (Rey) became Secretary of the Puerto Rico Department of Education (DOE). He, in turn, appointed José Aldanondo-Rivera (Aldanondo) to head up the DOE's adult education program (AEP) and Santos Meléndez as the AEP's general supervisor. All of these men had ties to the PDP.</p>\n<p>Prior to the 2001-2002 school year, the plaintiffs were employed by the AEP under serial one-year contracts. Those contracts were not renewed for the 2001-2002 school year. When that happened, the plaintiffs sued Rey, Aldanondo, and Meléndez in the federal district court. Invoking 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and various provisions of Puerto Rico's civil code, they chiefly alleged political discrimination. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Branti v. Finkel,</i> 445 U.S. 507, 515-16, 100 S.Ct. 1287, 63 L.Ed.2d 574 (1980); <i>Elrod v. Burns,</i> 427 U.S. 347, 373, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976).</p>\n<p>From our coign of vantage, the travel of the case is more important than the details of the plaintiffs' substantive claims. Consequently, we do not dwell on their allegations but, rather, limn the relevant procedural history. This is the chronology:</p>\n<blockquote>1. <i>June 23, 2003.</i> The plaintiffs commenced their civil action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>2. <i>August 19, 2004.</i> The district court issued a case-management order that, among other things, required discovery to be completed by January 15, 2005.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>3. <i>August 30, 2004.</i> The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint designed to add the nine regional directors of the AEP as additional defendants. The district court issued summonses to be served on the regional directors by September 20, 2004.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>4. <i>February 21, 2005.</i> The plaintiffs (who had not yet served the regional directors) moved for re-issuance of the now-expired summonses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>5. <i>March 3, 2005.</i> With the discovery deadline already in the rear-view mirror, the plaintiffs requested an additional period of between 30 and 50 days within which to conduct discovery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> 6. <i>March 22, 2005.</i> The plaintiffs sent written depositions to the regional directors without subpoenaing them even though the regional directors had never been served with summonses or otherwise made parties to the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>7. <i>April 7, 2005.</i> The district court refused to re-issue summonses for the regional directors (<i>see</i> Item No. 4, <i>supra</i>), calling the plaintiffs' failure to serve them in a timely manner \"inexcusable\" and \"negligent.\" The court also denied the plaintiffs' request to reopen the discovery period (<i>see</i> Item No. 5, <i>supra</i>). In its order, the court left the parties free to conduct consensual discovery, but warned that it \"will not entertain any disputes regarding . . . discovery\" and that \"[no] deadlines or settings [will] be changed.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote>8. <i>July 29, 2005.</i> Citing the dismissal of a federal discrimination claim in another case involving the AEP,<sup>[1]</sup> the district court gave the defendants until September 30, 2005 (later extended until October 24, 2005) to file dispositive motions. The court gave the plaintiffs until November 30, 2005 to file oppositions to any such motions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>9. <i>October 23, 2005.</i> The defendants filed a motion for summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>10. <i>October 25, 2005.</i> The plaintiffs requested an additional period (until January 20, 2006) within which to oppose the summary judgment motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>11. <i>November 8, 2005.</i> The district court granted the plaintiffs their requested extension to file an opposition to the summary judgment motion (<i>see</i> Item No. 10, <i>supra</i>). The court warned explicitly that \"no more extensions will be allowed.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote>12. <i>January 18, 2006.</i> Notwithstanding the district court's express caveat (<i>see</i> Item No. 11, <i>supra</i>), the plaintiffs requested a further extension, until March 20, 2006, for filing an opposition to the summary judgment motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>13. <i>March 3, 2006.</i> The plaintiffs subpoenaed documents held by Rey's successor as Secretary of Education, Rafael Aragunde (not a party to the action). Among other things, the subpoena sought a list of all school directors and other employees of the AEP during the 2000-2001 and 2001-2002 academic years. The plaintiffs never received the list and the defendants deny that such a list ever existed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>14. <i>March 7, 2006.</i> The plaintiffs filed yet another motion for an extension of time to respond to the summary judgment motion. This time, they invoked Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f) and professed a need for more discovery in order to oppose summary judgment. In an accompanying memorandum, their attorney claimed that he needed to depose the regional directors before composing such an opposition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>15. <i>March 23, 2006.</i> The defendants requested that the court deem their summary judgment motion unopposed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>16. <i>April 5, 2006.</i> The case was transferred to the calendar of a newly appointed district judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>17. <i>May 31, 2006.</i> The district court denied as moot the plaintiffs' January 18, 2006 request for an extension of time within which to oppose the summary judgment motion (<i>see</i> Item No. 12, <i>supra</i>).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>18. <i>August 14, 2006.</i> Pursuant to the filling of yet another judicial vacancy, the case was again transferred to the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> calendar of a newly-appointed district judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>19. <i>August 17, 2006.</i> The district court denied the Rule 56(f) motion (<i>see</i> Item No. 14, <i>supra</i>) and granted the defendants' entreaty to deem the summary motion unopposed (<i>see</i> Item No. 15, <i>supra</i>).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>20. <i>August 23, 2006.</i> Discerning no genuine issue as to any material fact, the district court (Gelpí, J.) entered summary judgment in favor of the defendants.</blockquote>\n<p>This timely appeal ensued. In it, the plaintiffs assail the district court's refusal to grant further extensions of the discovery deadline; its decision to deem the summary judgment motion unopposed; and its subsequent entry of summary judgment.</p>\n<p>For the most part, these claims of error are so weak as not to warrant extended discussion. The district court exhibited great patience with the plaintiffs, warned them explicitly that continued noncompliance would have consequences, and took final action only when the plaintiffs had piled delay upon delay. \"[C]ourts  like the deity  are more prone to help those who help themselves,\" <i>Williams v. Drake,</i> 146 F.3d 44, 50 (1st Cir.1998), and the plaintiffs, through their indolence, forfeited any plausible claim to further indulgences.</p>\n<p>The one point that merits elaboration is the plaintiffs' attempt to invoke Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f).<sup>[2]</sup> We turn to the district court's ruling on that issue, mindful that a district court's denial of a Rule 56(f) motion is reviewed on appeal solely for abuse of discretion. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Mass. Sch. of Law at Andover, Inc. v. Am. Bar Ass'n,</i> 142 F.3d 26, 44 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n<p>We begin with bedrock: Rule 56(f) serves a salutary purpose within the summary judgment framework. When a party confronted by a motion for summary judgment legitimately needs additional time to marshal the facts necessary to mount an opposition, the rule provides a useful safety valve. <i>See </i><i>Resolution Trust Corp. v. N. Bridge Assocs., Inc.,</i> 22 F.3d 1198, 1203 (1st Cir.1994). Deployed appropriately, \"[t]he rule . . . safeguard[s] against judges swinging the summary judgment axe too hastily.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Be that as it may, the prophylaxis of Rule 56(f) is not available merely for the asking. A litigant who seeks to invoke the rule must act with due diligence to show that his predicament fits within its confines. To that end, the litigant must submit to the trial court an affidavit or other authoritative document showing (i) good cause for his inability to have discovered or marshalled the necessary facts earlier in the proceedings; (ii) a plausible basis for believing that additional facts probably exist and can be retrieved within a reasonable time; and (iii) an explanation of how those facts, if collected, will suffice to defeat the pending summary judgment motion. <i>See </i><i>Vélez v. Awning Windows, Inc.,</i> 375 F.3d 35, 40 (1st Cir.2004); <i>Paterson-Leitch Co. v. Mass. Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co.,</i> 840 F.2d 985, 988 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n<p>We add a further caveat: Rule 56(f) is not designed to give relief to those who sleep upon their rights. <i>See </i><i>Ayala-Gerena</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> <i>v. Bristol Myers-Squibb Co.,</i> 95 F.3d 86, 92 (1st Cir.1996). Consequently, a party seeking to derive the benefit of Rule 56(f) must demonstrate due diligence both in conducting discovery before the emergence of the summary judgment motion and in pursuing an extension of time once the motion has surfaced. <i>See </i><i>Resolution Trust,</i> 22 F.3d at 1203.</p>\n<p>Viewed through this prism, we do not think that the district court abused its discretion in denying the plaintiffs' Rule 56(f) motion. In the first place, the plaintiffs' proffer fell far short of the requisite showing. In the second place, the plaintiffs' conduct, both before and after the emergence of the summary judgment motion, was characterized by the polar opposite of due diligence. We explain briefly.</p>\n<p>To begin, the plaintiffs' Rule 56(f) motion failed to show good cause for their professed inability to conduct the desired discovery at an earlier date. The district court afforded the parties a reasonable interval for pretrial discovery  they had almost 18 months from the inception of the action  and, for aught that appears, the plaintiffs simply frittered the time away.</p>\n<p>This is not to say that the plaintiffs are short on excuses; they variously blame the defendants' uncooperative attitude during discovery, the regional directors' evasiveness, the transfer of the case from judge to judge, and what they perceive as a gadarene rush to judgment in the summer of 2006. But once past the plaintiffs' rhetorical flourishes, the frailty of these excuses becomes readily apparent. None of them shows good cause for the plaintiffs' inordinate delay.</p>\n<p>The claim that the defendants disrupted the discovery process is belied by the plaintiffs' abject failure to use the available means of discovery during the generous discovery period allowed by the district court. Indeed, the plaintiffs' claim of disruption centers on something that occurred <i>after</i> the close of formal discovery and during the subsequent period of consensual discovery permitted by the district court (<i>see</i> Item No. 7, <i>supra</i>): the defendants' refusal to hand over a list of AEP directors and employees for the 2000-2001 and 2001-2002 school years. In addition to an obvious lack of timeliness, this claim suffers from no fewer than three major infirmities: the plaintiffs have not shown that such a list existed, nor have they shown that they could not have compiled such a list themselves from the copious documents transmitted to them in the discovery process, nor have they shown that they seasonably availed themselves of any of the usual remedies for a failure of production during the discovery period. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 37.</p>\n<p>In all events, the list had no direct bearing on the plaintiffs' ability to conduct the discovery sought in their Rule 56(f) motion: the depositions of the regional directors. Those depositions could (and should) have been taken in a timely manner regardless of the availability of the evanescent list.</p>\n<p>Much the same can be said about the plaint that the regional directors' failure to answer the written depositions addressed to them handicapped the plaintiffs. First, the plaintiffs' appellate brief conspicuously fails to justify why they failed to submit the written depositions (and subpoena the witnesses, if necessary) within the discovery period. Second, notwithstanding the regional directors' lack of cooperation, the plaintiffs inexplicably waited an entire year before asking the court for additional discovery vis-à-vis the regional directors.</p>\n<p>This brings us to the plaintiffs' importuning that the transfer of the case from judge to judge, together with Judge Gelpí's prompt adjudication of outstanding <span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> motions once the case was assigned to his calendar, unfairly surprised them. This importuning rings hollow. Parties have no vested right to have their cases heard by a particular judge. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Colon-Munoz,</i> 292 F.3d 18, 22 (1st Cir.2002); <i>Sinito v. United States,</i> 750 F.2d 512, 515 (6th Cir.1984). And to deem the court's adjudication \"hasty\" is ludicrous. Nearly ten months passed between the filing of the defendants' motion for summary judgment and the granting of the defendants' request to deem that motion unopposed. That hardly can be characterized as a rush to judgment. <i>Cf.</i> D.P.R.R. 7(b) (allowing ten days within which to respond to motions).</p>\n<p>To cinch matters, the district court explicitly warned the plaintiffs in November of 2005 that no further extensions of time would be permitted in connection with the pending summary judgment motion. <i>See</i> Item No. 11, <i>supra.</i> Given this aposematic statement, the plaintiffs had every reason to believe that continued inattention to the summary judgment motion would prove problematic. Parties ought to expect that courts will say what they mean and mean what they say. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Torres v. Puerto Rico,</i> 485 F.3d 5, 10 (1st Cir. 2007). Seen in this light, the district court's disposition of the motion in August of 2006 could not have come as a surprise.</p>\n<p>At the expense of carting coal to Newcastle, we add that the plaintiffs also failed to satisfy the second and third elements of the Rule 56(f) standard. The motion papers disclose no plausible basis for a belief that deposing the regional directors would lead to material facts that might defeat summary judgment. To the contrary, the motion is wholly conclusory; it merely states that \"the information that could be obtained from the regional directors' depositions [is] essential\" to crafting an opposition to the summary judgment motion. Speculative conclusions, unanchored in facts, are not sufficient to ground a Rule 56(f) motion. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Vargas-Ruiz v. Golden Arch Dev., Inc.,</i> 368 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2004) (explaining that, in this context, a plaintiff's \"optimistic surmise\" carries no weight); <i>Paterson-Leitch,</i> 840 F.2d at 989 (stating that \"cryptic allusions [that] fail[ ] to set out any basis for believing that some discoverable material facts . . . exist\" are \"entirely insufficient to extract the balm of Rule 56(f)\").</p>\n<p>The final straw is the plaintiffs' utter disregard for deadlines throughout the course of this litigation. The plaintiffs were afforded ample time within which to conduct discovery. They were given one extension and warned that no further extensions would be forthcoming. In all, a full twenty-eight months passed between the commencement of the action and the filing of the summary judgment motion. We think it significant that, early on, the plaintiffs recognized the potential importance of the regional directors; after all, they attempted to amend their complaint to add the regional directors as defendants on August 30, 2004 (<i>see</i> Item No. 3, <i>supra</i>). At that point in time, the discovery period was still open and the summary judgment motion was more than a year from being filed. The plaintiffs nonetheless neglected to secure the regional directors' testimony during the time allotted for pretrial discovery.</p>\n<p>Even after the defendants moved for summary judgment, the plaintiffs dragged their feet: they lollygagged more than five months before filing their Rule 56(f) motion and announcing their professed need to depose the regional directors. That was too little and too late: Rule 56(f) is meant to minister to the vigilant, not to those who sleep upon perceptible rights.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> On this record, we conclude without serious question that the district court acted within the realm of its discretion in denying the plaintiffs' Rule 56(f) motion.<sup>[3]</sup> Relatedly, we conclude that the court, faced with a summary judgment motion that had been pending for nearly ten months without a substantive response, acted within its discretion in deeming that motion unopposed. <i>See </i><i>Vélez,</i> 375 F.3d at 41.</p>\n<p>That brings us to the merits of the motion for summary judgment. We have reviewed that motion and the supporting papers, mindful that even an unopposed motion for summary judgment should not be granted unless the record discloses that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <i>See id.</i> at 42; <i>Mendez v. Banco Popular de P.R.,</i> 900 F.2d 4, 7-8 (1st Cir.1990); <i>see also</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(e) (instructing that if the adverse party fails to respond, \"summary judgment, <i>if appropriate,</i> shall be entered\") (emphasis supplied). The instant motion passes that rigorous test.</p>\n<p>We need go no further. The plaintiffs have made a gallimaufry of other arguments, but all of them are either plainly incorrect, insufficiently developed, or both.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></a></span> (1976).</p>\n<p>From our coign of vantage, the travel of the case is more important than the details of the plaintiffs' substantive claims. Consequently, we do not dwell on their allegations but, rather, limn the relevant procedural history. This is the chronology:</p>\n<blockquote>1. <i>June 23, 2003.</i> The plaintiffs commenced their civil action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>2. <i>August 19, 2004.</i> The district court issued a case-management order that, among other things, required discovery to be completed by January 15, 2005.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>3. <i>August 30, 2004.</i> The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint designed to add the nine regional directors of the AEP as additional defendants. The district court issued summonses to be served on the regional directors by September 20, 2004.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>4. <i>February 21, 2005.</i> The plaintiffs (who had not yet served the regional directors) moved for re-issuance of the now-expired summonses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>5. <i>March 3, 2005.</i> With the discovery deadline already in the rear-view mirror, the plaintiffs requested an additional period of between 30 and 50 days within which to conduct discovery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> 6. <i>March 22, 2005.</i> The plaintiffs sent written depositions to the regional directors without subpoenaing them even though the regional directors had never been served with summonses or otherwise made parties to the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>7. <i>April 7, 2005.</i> The district court refused to re-issue summonses for the regional directors (<i>see</i> Item No. 4, <i>supra</i>), calling the plaintiffs' failure to serve them in a timely manner \"inexcusable\" and \"negligent.\" The court also denied the plaintiffs' request to reopen the discovery period (<i>see</i> Item No. 5, <i>supra</i>). In its order, the court left the parties free to conduct consensual discovery, but warned that it \"will not entertain any disputes regarding . . . discovery\" and that \"[no] deadlines or settings [will] be changed.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote>8. <i>July 29, 2005.</i> Citing the dismissal of a federal discrimination claim in another case involving the AEP,<sup>[1]</sup> the district court gave the defendants until September 30, 2005 (later extended until October 24, 2005) to file dispositive motions. The court gave the plaintiffs until November 30, 2005 to file oppositions to any such motions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>9. <i>October 23, 2005.</i> The defendants filed a motion for summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>10. <i>October 25, 2005.</i> The plaintiffs requested an additional period (until January 20, 2006) within which to oppose the summary judgment motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>11. <i>November 8, 2005.</i> The district court granted the plaintiffs their requested extension to file an opposition to the summary judgment motion (<i>see</i> Item No. 10, <i>supra</i>). The court warned explicitly that \"no more extensions will be allowed.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote>12. <i>January 18, 2006.</i> Notwithstanding the district court's express caveat (<i>see</i> Item No. 11, <i>supra</i>), the plaintiffs requested a further extension, until March 20, 2006, for filing an opposition to the summary judgment motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>13. <i>March 3, 2006.</i> The plaintiffs subpoenaed documents held by Rey's successor as Secretary of Education, Rafael Aragunde (not a party to the action). Among other things, the subpoena sought a list of all school directors and other employees of the AEP during the 2000-2001 and 2001-2002 academic years. The plaintiffs never received the list and the defendants deny that such a list ever existed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>14. <i>March 7, 2006.</i> The plaintiffs filed yet another motion for an extension of time to respond to the summary judgment motion. This time, they invoked Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f) and professed a need for more discovery in order to oppose summary judgment. In an accompanying memorandum, their attorney claimed that he needed to depose the regional directors before composing such an opposition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>15. <i>March 23, 2006.</i> The defendants requested that the court deem their summary judgment motion unopposed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>16. <i>April 5, 2006.</i> The case was transferred to the calendar of a newly appointed district judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>17. <i>May 31, 2006.</i> The district court denied as moot the plaintiffs' January 18, 2006 request for an extension of time within which to oppose the summary judgment motion (<i>see</i> Item No. 12, <i>supra</i>).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>18. <i>August 14, 2006.</i> Pursuant to the filling of yet another judicial vacancy, the case was again transferred to the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> calendar of a newly-appointed district judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>19. <i>August 17, 2006.</i> The district court denied the Rule 56(f) motion (<i>see</i> Item No. 14, <i>supra</i>) and granted the defendants' entreaty to deem the summary motion unopposed (<i>see</i> Item No. 15, <i>supra</i>).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>20. <i>August 23, 2006.</i> Discerning no genuine issue as to any material fact, the district court (Gelpí, J.) entered summary judgment in favor of the defendants.</blockquote>\n<p>This timely appeal ensued. In it, the plaintiffs assail the district court's refusal to grant further extensions of the discovery deadline; its decision to deem the summary judgment motion unopposed; and its subsequent entry of summary judgment.</p>\n<p>For the most part, these claims of error are so weak as not to warrant extended discussion. The district court exhibited great patience with the plaintiffs, warned them explicitly that continued noncompliance would have consequences, and took final action only when the plaintiffs had piled delay upon delay. \"[C]ourts  like the deity  are more prone to help those who help themselves,\" <i>Williams v. Drake,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198058\"><a href=\"/opinion/198058/williams-v-drake/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span>, 50 (1st Cir.1998), and the plaintiffs, through their indolence, forfeited any plausible claim to further indulgences.</p>\n<p>The one point that merits elaboration is the plaintiffs' attempt to invoke Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f).<sup>[2]</sup> We turn to the district court's ruling on that issue, mindful that a district court's denial of a Rule 56(f) motion is reviewed on appeal solely for abuse of discretion. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Mass. Sch. of Law at Andover, Inc. v. Am. Bar Ass'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197918\"><a href=\"/opinion/197918/massachusetts-school-v-american-bar/\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 44 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n<p>We begin with bedrock: Rule 56(f) serves a salutary purpose within the summary judgment framework. When a party confronted by a motion for summary judgment legitimately needs additional time to marshal the facts necessary to mount an opposition, the rule provides a useful safety valve. <i>See </i><i>Resolution Trust Corp. v. N. Bridge Assocs., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"669068\"><a href=\"/opinion/669068/resolution-trust-corporation-v-north-bridge-associates-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1198</span></a></span>, 1203 (1st Cir.1994). Deployed appropriately, \"[t]he rule . . . safeguard[s] against judges swinging the summary judgment axe too hastily.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Be that as it may, the prophylaxis of Rule 56(f) is not available merely for the asking. A litigant who seeks to invoke the rule must act with due diligence to show that his predicament fits within its confines. To that end, the litigant must submit to the trial court an affidavit or other authoritative document showing (i) good cause for his inability to have discovered or marshalled the necessary facts earlier in the proceedings; (ii) a plausible basis for believing that additional facts probably exist and can be retrieved within a reasonable time; and (iii) an explanation of how those facts, if collected, will suffice to defeat the pending summary judgment motion. <i>See </i><i>Vélez v. Awning Windows, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201113\"><a href=\"/opinion/201113/velez-cortes-v-awning-windows-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">375</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span>, 40 (1st Cir.2004); <i>Paterson-Leitch Co. v. Mass. Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"502424\"><a href=\"/opinion/502424/paterson-leitch-company-inc-v-massachusetts-municipal-wholesale-electric/\"><span class=\"volume\">840</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">985</span></a></span>, 988 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n<p>We add a further caveat: Rule 56(f) is not designed to give relief to those who sleep upon their rights. <i>See </i><i>Ayala-Gerena</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> <i>v. Bristol Myers-Squibb Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"726050\"><a href=\"/opinion/726050/71-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1398-35-fedrserv3d-395-miguel-angel/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span>, 92 (1st Cir.1996). Consequently, a party seeking to derive the benefit of Rule 56(f) must demonstrate due diligence both in conducting discovery before the emergence of the summary judgment motion and in pursuing an extension of time once the motion has surfaced. <i>See </i><i>Resolution Trust,</i> 22 F.3d at 1203.</p>\n<p>Viewed through this prism, we do not think that the district court abused its discretion in denying the plaintiffs' Rule 56(f) motion. In the first place, the plaintiffs' proffer fell far short of the requisite showing. In the second place, the plaintiffs' conduct, both before and after the emergence of the summary judgment motion, was characterized by the polar opposite of due diligence. We explain briefly.</p>\n<p>To begin, the plaintiffs' Rule 56(f) motion failed to show good cause for their professed inability to conduct the desired discovery at an earlier date. The district court afforded the parties a reasonable interval for pretrial discovery  they had almost 18 months from the inception of the action  and, for aught that appears, the plaintiffs simply frittered the time away.</p>\n<p>This is not to say that the plaintiffs are short on excuses; they variously blame the defendants' uncooperative attitude during discovery, the regional directors' evasiveness, the transfer of the case from judge to judge, and what they perceive as a gadarene rush to judgment in the summer of 2006. But once past the plaintiffs' rhetorical flourishes, the frailty of these excuses becomes readily apparent. None of them shows good cause for the plaintiffs' inordinate delay.</p>\n<p>The claim that the defendants disrupted the discovery process is belied by the plaintiffs' abject failure to use the available means of discovery during the generous discovery period allowed by the district court. Indeed, the plaintiffs' claim of disruption centers on something that occurred <i>after</i> the close of formal discovery and during the subsequent period of consensual discovery permitted by the district court (<i>see</i> Item No. 7, <i>supra</i>): the defendants' refusal to hand over a list of AEP directors and employees for the 2000-2001 and 2001-2002 school years. In addition to an obvious lack of timeliness, this claim suffers from no fewer than three major infirmities: the plaintiffs have not shown that such a list existed, nor have they shown that they could not have compiled such a list themselves from the copious documents transmitted to them in the discovery process, nor have they shown that they seasonably availed themselves of any of the usual remedies for a failure of production during the discovery period. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 37.</p>\n<p>In all events, the list had no direct bearing on the plaintiffs' ability to conduct the discovery sought in their Rule 56(f) motion: the depositions of the regional directors. Those depositions could (and should) have been taken in a timely manner regardless of the availability of the evanescent list.</p>\n<p>Much the same can be said about the plaint that the regional directors' failure to answer the written depositions addressed to them handicapped the plaintiffs. First, the plaintiffs' appellate brief conspicuously fails to justify why they failed to submit the written depositions (and subpoena the witnesses, if necessary) within the discovery period. Second, notwithstanding the regional directors' lack of cooperation, the plaintiffs inexplicably waited an entire year before asking the court for additional discovery vis-à-vis the regional directors.</p>\n<p>This brings us to the plaintiffs' importuning that the transfer of the case from judge to judge, together with Judge Gelpí's prompt adjudication of outstanding <span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> motions once the case was assigned to his calendar, unfairly surprised them. This importuning rings hollow. Parties have no vested right to have their cases heard by a particular judge. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Colon-Munoz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200414\"><a href=\"/opinion/200414/united-states-v-colon-munoz/\"><span class=\"volume\">292</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir.2002); <i>Sinito v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"445490\"><a href=\"/opinion/445490/charles-sinito-jr-83-3791-thomas-j-sinito-84-3018-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">750</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">512</span></a></span>, 515 (6th Cir.1984). And to deem the court's adjudication \"hasty\" is ludicrous. Nearly ten months passed between the filing of the defendants' motion for summary judgment and the granting of the defendants' request to deem that motion unopposed. That hardly can be characterized as a rush to judgment. <i>Cf.</i> D.P.R.R. 7(b) (allowing ten days within which to respond to motions).</p>\n<p>To cinch matters, the district court explicitly warned the plaintiffs in November of 2005 that no further extensions of time would be permitted in connection with the pending summary judgment motion. <i>See</i> Item No. 11, <i>supra.</i> Given this aposematic statement, the plaintiffs had every reason to believe that continued inattention to the summary judgment motion would prove problematic. Parties ought to expect that courts will say what they mean and mean what they say. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Torres v. Puerto Rico,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202693\"><a href=\"/opinion/202693/torres-v-commonwealth-of-pr/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir. 2007). Seen in this light, the district court's disposition of the motion in August of 2006 could not have come as a surprise.</p>\n<p>At the expense of carting coal to Newcastle, we add that the plaintiffs also failed to satisfy the second and third elements of the Rule 56(f) standard. The motion papers disclose no plausible basis for a belief that deposing the regional directors would lead to material facts that might defeat summary judgment. To the contrary, the motion is wholly conclusory; it merely states that \"the information that could be obtained from the regional directors' depositions [is] essential\" to crafting an opposition to the summary judgment motion. Speculative conclusions, unanchored in facts, are not sufficient to ground a Rule 56(f) motion. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Vargas-Ruiz v. Golden Arch Dev., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201001\"><a href=\"/opinion/201001/vargas-ruiz-v-golden-arch/\"><span class=\"volume\">368</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.2004) (explaining that, in this context, a plaintiff's \"optimistic surmise\" carries no weight); <i>Paterson-Leitch,</i> 840 F.2d at 989 (stating that \"cryptic allusions [that] fail[ ] to set out any basis for believing that some discoverable material facts . . . exist\" are \"entirely insufficient to extract the balm of Rule 56(f)\").</p>\n<p>The final straw is the plaintiffs' utter disregard for deadlines throughout the course of this litigation. The plaintiffs were afforded ample time within which to conduct discovery. They were given one extension and warned that no further extensions would be forthcoming. In all, a full twenty-eight months passed between the commencement of the action and the filing of the summary judgment motion. We think it significant that, early on, the plaintiffs recognized the potential importance of the regional directors; after all, they attempted to amend their complaint to add the regional directors as defendants on August 30, 2004 (<i>see</i> Item No. 3, <i>supra</i>). At that point in time, the discovery period was still open and the summary judgment motion was more than a year from being filed. The plaintiffs nonetheless neglected to secure the regional directors' testimony during the time allotted for pretrial discovery.</p>\n<p>Even after the defendants moved for summary judgment, the plaintiffs dragged their feet: they lollygagged more than five months before filing their Rule 56(f) motion and announcing their professed need to depose the regional directors. That was too little and too late: Rule 56(f) is meant to minister to the vigilant, not to those who sleep upon perceptible rights.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> On this record, we conclude without serious question that the district court acted within the realm of its discretion in denying the plaintiffs' Rule 56(f) motion.<sup>[3]</sup> Relatedly, we conclude that the court, faced with a summary judgment motion that had been pending for nearly ten months without a substantive response, acted within its discretion in deeming that motion unopposed. <i>See </i><i>Vélez,</i> 375 F.3d at 41.</p>\n<p>That brings us to the merits of the motion for summary judgment. We have reviewed that motion and the supporting papers, mindful that even an unopposed motion for summary judgment should not be granted unless the record discloses that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <i>See id.</i> at 42; <i>Mendez v. Banco Popular de P.R.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"539215\"><a href=\"/opinion/539215/julio-mendez-aka-julio-mendez-rodriguez-v-banco-popular-de-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">900</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span>, 7-8 (1st Cir.1990); <i>see also</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(e) (instructing that if the adverse party fails to respond, \"summary judgment, <i>if appropriate,</i> shall be entered\") (emphasis supplied). The instant motion passes that rigorous test.</p>\n<p>We need go no further. The plaintiffs have made a gallimaufry of other arguments, but all of them are either plainly incorrect, insufficiently developed, or both. Accordingly, we hold that the district court did not err in entering summary judgment in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The decision that the district court cited was recently affirmed on appeal. <i>See </i><i>Hatfield-Bermudez v. Aldanondo-Rivera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1454041\"><a href=\"/opinion/1454041/hatfield-bermudez-v-aldanondo-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2007). It has no bearing on the issues before us.</p>\n<p>[2]  The rule states:\n</p>\n<p>Should it appear from the affidavits of a party opposing the motion [for summary judgment] that the party cannot for reasons stated present by affidavit facts essential to justify the party's opposition, the court may refuse the application for judgment or may order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or depositions to be taken or discovery to be had or may make such other order as is just.</p>\n<p>[3]  As an added justification for their failure to oppose the motion for summary judgment in a timely manner, the plaintiffs allude to their counsel's poor health. This allusion does not help their cause: the attorney's \"transient ischemic attack\" reportedly occurred on June 13, 2006  five months <i>after</i> the opposition was due and three months <i>after</i> the plaintiffs filed their (inadequate) Rule 56(f) motion.</p>\n\n</div>",
