Antonetti-Stutts, Solicitor General, and Mariana D.\nNegron-Vargas, Deputy Solicitor General, and Maite D. Oronoz-\nRodriguez, Deputy Solicitor General, were on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n                                January 4, 2007\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f           SILER, Senior Circuit Judge.    Plaintiff Aida D. Rivera-\n\nMartinez appeals the dismissal of her hostile work environment and\n\nretaliatory harassment claims against the Puerto Rico Treasury\n\nDepartment and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (“Defendants”).\n\nRivera-Martinez contends that while working in the Human Relations\n\nDepartment of the Treasury Department (“Treasury Department”),\n\nspecifically in the Training Center, she was subjected to sexual\n\nharassment by her supervisor, Eduardo Rivera-Marrero.    She claims\n\nthat Rivera-Marrero’s conduct created a hostile work environment\n\nand that Defendants retaliated against her by tolerating harassment\n\nby an employee.   Rivera-Martinez seeks relief under Title VII of\n\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et\n\nseq., (“Title VII”), as well as Art. I, Sec. II of the Puerto Rico\n\nConstitution for breach of her human dignity protection.        The\n\ndistrict court dismissed her Title VII claims and dismissed without\n\nprejudice her state law claim.        For the following reasons, we\n\nAFFIRM.\n\n                                I.\n\n           Rivera-Martinez’s claims derive primarily from two\n\nspecific incidents.   First, she claims that in June 2001, she was\n\n“sexually touched in her left forearm” by her supervisor, Rivera-\n\nMarrero.    According to Rivera-Martinez, Rivera-Marrero “gently\n\ncaressed her forearm in an up and down motion,” and in response to\n\n\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fthis touching, Rivera-Martinez pulled away and angrily declared,\n\n“Do not touch me any more.”\n\n            The second incident took place on September 20, 2002,\n\nwhen Rivera-Martinez and Delia Zayas were called to a meeting in\n\nRivera-Marrero’s office. In that meeting, Rivera-Marrero allegedly\n\nchided Rivera-Martinez for violations of several office procedures\n\nand improper office behavior.     Rivera-Martinez denied wrongdoing\n\nand countered by pointing out irregularities she had observed in\n\noffice procedure and conduct.      Suddenly, according to Rivera-\n\nMartinez, Rivera-Marrero walked over to Rivera-Martinez and grabbed\n\nher.   “[H]e began to twist her torso by placing one hand [on] her\n\nback and the [other hand on] her upper torso [on] the brassiere\n\narea.”   Rivera-Martinez claims that Rivera-Marrero’s hand touched\n\nher hip and buttocks and that Rivera-Marrero “used his hip and\n\npubic area” to push her out of the office.   Zayas did confirm that\n\nRivera-Marrero touched Rivera-Martinez on the arm and on her mid\n\nback “where the bra is,” but stated that she believed that Marrero\n\nwould have behaved the same way with either a male or female\n\nemployee.\n\n            On September 23, 2002, Rivera-Martinez wrote a letter to\n\nthe Secretary of the Treasury Department describing the September\n\n20 meeting and requesting an immediate solution.    Rivera-Martinez\n\nclaimed that “abuse and negligence has been and is being committed\n\nagainst me” but she did not describe Rivera-Marrero’s conduct as\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fsexual   harassment.        The   Treasury     Department     investigated   and\n\nconcluded that no assault had occurred.            Rivera-Martinez filed an\n\nadministrative complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity\n\nCommission on March 17, 2003, claiming that she had been sexually\n\nharassed.\n\n            Rivera-Martinez also asserts that Rivera-Marrero sexually\n\nharassed    other    Treasury     Department    employees.       She    describes\n\nseveral occasions where Rivera-Marrero allegedly abused co-workers\n\nLilliam Rolon and Sandra Ostolaza.\n\n            The district court concluded that Rivera-Martinez did not\n\npresent sufficient evidence that the harassment was based on gender\n\nand that the two incidents alleged by Rivera-Martinez did not meet\n\nthe degree of severity and pervasiveness required to support an\n\nactionable hostile work environment claim. The lower court granted\n\nDefendants’ motion for summary judgment, and               having dismissed the\n\nfederal-based       cause   of    action,    the   court    dismissed    without\n\nprejudice the remaining state law claim.\n\n                                      II.\n\n            We review summary judgment de novo, construing the record\n\nin the light most favorable to the nonmovant and resolving all\n\nreasonable inferences in the nonmovant’s favor.               Rosenberg v. City\n\nof Everett, 328 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n            We begin by addressing Rivera-Martinez’s hostile work\n\nenvironment claim. Rivera-Martinez challenges the district court’s\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\ffinding that she failed to show that the harassment was based on\n\ngender.   She    also   asserts   that   her   evidence   of   harassment\n\ndemonstrates severity and pervasiveness sufficient to alter the\n\nconditions of her employment.\n\n          Under Title VII, it is an “unlawful employment practice\n\nfor an employer . . . to discriminate against any individual with\n\nrespect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of\n\nemployment, because of such individual’s . . . sex.”           42 U.S.C. §\n\n2000e-2(a)(1).   The scope of Title VII covers more than “economic”\n\nor “tangible” discrimination.      Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc.,\n\n510 U.S. 17, 21 (1993) (quoting Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v.\n\nVinson, 477 U.S. 57 (1986)). Title VII prohibits sexual harassment\n\nso “severe or pervasive” as to “alter the conditions of [the\n\nvictim’s] employment and create an abusive working environment.”\n\nMeritor, 477 U.S. at 67.\n\n          To succeed on her hostile work environment claim, Rivera-\n\nMartinez must establish the following:\n\n          (1) that she . . . is a member of a protected class; (2)\n          that she was subjected to unwelcome sexual harassment;\n          (3) that the harassment was based upon sex; (4) that the\n          harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive so as to\n          alter the conditions of plaintiff’s employment and create\n          an   abusive   work   environment;   (5)   that   sexually\n          objectionable    conduct   was   both    objectively   and\n          subjectively offensive, such that a reasonable person\n          would find it hostile or abusive and the victim in fact\n          did perceive it to be so; and (6) that some basis for\n          employer liability has been established.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fO’Rourke v. City of Providence, 235 F.3d 713, 728 (1st Cir. 2001)\n\n(citing Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 787-89\n\n(1998); Harris, 510 U.S. at 20-23; and Meritor, 477 U.S. at 65-73).\n\nThe   focus    of    hostile   work   environment     cases   is   generally    on\n\nelements (4) and (5).          Id.\n\n              As the Supreme Court noted in Harris, the test for\n\nproving a hostile work environment “is not, and by its nature\n\ncannot be, . . . mathematically precise.”              Harris, 510 U.S. at 22.\n\nTo determine whether an environment is sufficiently “hostile” or\n\n“abusive,” a court must examine the totality of the circumstances\n\nincluding     “the    frequency      of    the   discriminatory    conduct;    its\n\nseverity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or\n\na mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes\n\nwith an employee’s work performance.”                  Id. at 23.       “‘Simple\n\nteasing,’      offhand    comments,        and   isolated   incidents   (unless\n\nextremely serious)” do not amount to a hostile work environment.\n\nFaragher, 524 U.S. at 788 (1998) (quoting Oncale v. Sundowner\n\nOffshore Servs., 523 U.S. 75, 82 (1998)).                   Title VII was not\n\nintended to be a “general civility code”; therefore, conduct must\n\nbe extreme to be actionable.              Id.\n\n              In the case at hand, the district court found that\n\nRivera-Martinez failed to demonstrate that the alleged harassment\n\nwas because of her gender.            We agree.      Rivera-Martinez provides\n\nvery little context for the first incident. She merely states that\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fshe was “sexually touched” on the forearm. In the second incident,\n\nassuming the plaintiff’s version of the facts, Rivera-Marrero\n\ngrabbed her back and shoulder, touched her hip, buttocks, and\n\nbrassiere area, and pushed her out of his office.                 This episode\n\noccurred following a heated exchange between the two and happened\n\nin the presence of another employee.           There is no indication that\n\nRivera-Marrero’s     behavior,      while   inappropriate,      was   sexual   in\n\nnature. Rather, his conduct appears to be the product of his anger\n\ntoward Rivera-Martinez for challenging him and pointing out various\n\nproblems within the office.\n\n           However, discriminatory harassment does not have to be\n\novertly sex-specific in content to be actionable under Title VII.\n\n“Harassing conduct need not be motivated by sexual desire to\n\nsupport an inference of discrimination on the basis of sex.”\n\nOncale, 523 U.S. at 80. The Oncale court emphasized, “The critical\n\nissue, Title VII's text indicates, is whether members of one sex\n\nare exposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to\n\nwhich members of the other sex are not exposed.” Id. (quoting\n\nHarris, 510 U.S. at 25 (Ginsburg, J., concurring)).              In this case,\n\nalthough   Rivera-Martinez         offers    evidence    that    other   female\n\nemployees were mistreated by Rivera-Marrero, she does not assert\n\nthat   women   in   the   office    were    treated   differently     than   male\n\nworkers.   Another Treasury Department employee, Zayas, stated, “I\n\ndon’t see that [Rivera-Marrero] establishes, in general terms, a\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fbig difference when dealing with any male or any . . . female.\n\nBasically he’s equally authoritative one way or the other.”\n\n           Even if the harassment is assumed to be because of her\n\ngender, Rivera-Martinez still fails to show that it was severe or\n\npervasive.     Applying the factors cited in Harris to determine what\n\ncreates an “abusive” or “hostile” environment, Rivera-Martinez’s\n\nclaim falls short.      The harassment Rivera-Martinez alleges was\n\ninfrequent; she cites only two incidents that are over a year\n\napart.    Although an isolated event may create a hostile work\n\nenvironment, it must be “extremely serious.” Faragher, 524 U.S. at\n\n788.     The   inappropriate   behavior   here   does   involve   unwanted\n\nphysical touching, but both incidents were relatively limited.          At\n\nworst, Rivera-Martinez was on one occasion inappropriately touched\n\non her arm and in another instance hastily pushed out of an office.\n\nSee, e.g., Morgan v. Mass. Gen. Hosp., 901 F.2d 186, 192-93 (1st\n\nCir. 1990) (concluding that conduct was not sufficiently severe or\n\npervasive where a coworker stood behind the plaintiff so as to\n\npurposefully bump into him and “peeped” at plaintiff’s genitals\n\nwhile standing next to him in the restroom); Burnett v. Tyco Corp.,\n\n203 F.3d 980, 985 (6th Cir. 2000) (holding that “a single battery\n\ncoupled with two merely offensive remarks over a six month period”\n\ndoes not create a hostile work environment); Saxton v. American\n\nTel. & Tel. Co., 10 F.3d 526, 528-35 (7th Cir. 1993) (finding two\n\nincidents of unwanted sexual advances did not constitute severe\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fharassment       where    the    supervisor      “placed    his     hand    on   [the\n\nplaintiff’s] leg above the knee several times,” “rubbed his hand\n\nalong her upper thigh,” “kissed her for two to three seconds until\n\nshe pushed him away,” and then, three weeks later, attempted to\n\ngrab her).        Furthermore, Rivera-Martinez never claims that the\n\nharassment had a negative impact on her work performance. See Lee-\n\nCrespo    v.    Schering-Plough     Del    Caribe,    Inc.,   354    F.3d    34,   46\n\n(affirming summary judgment in favor of an employer in a hostile\n\nenvironment case where the conduct “was never . . . an impediment\n\nto [the plaintiff’s] work performance”).\n\n               Rivera-Martinez may have experienced discomfort as a\n\nresult of the Rivera-Marrero’s behavior, but she has not presented\n\nadequate evidence of harassment to allow a reasonable jury to find\n\nthat she was subjected to a hostile work environment.\n\n               Rivera-Martinez also claims that she suffered retaliation\n\nby the Treasury Department following her September 23, 2002, letter\n\nto the Secretary of the Treasury.               To state a prima facie case of\n\nretaliation, a plaintiff must prove that “(1) she engaged in\n\nprotected conduct under Title VII; (2) she suffered an adverse\n\nemployment      action;    and    (3)   the     adverse    action    was    causally\n\nconnected to the protected activity.”               Marrero v. Goya of Puerto\n\nRico, Inc., 304 F.3d 7, 22 (1st Cir. 2002) (citing Hernandez-Torres\n\nv. Intercontinental Trading, Inc., 158 F.3d 43, 47 (1st Cir.\n\n1998)).\n\n                                          -9-\n\f            Adverse      employment       actions        include       “demotions,\n\ndisadvantageous transfers or assignments, refusals to promote,\n\nunwarranted negative job evaluations, and toleration of harassment\n\nby other employees.”          Id. at 23 (quoting White v. New Hampshire\n\nDep’t of Corrections, 221 F.3d 254, 262 (1st Cir. 2000)).                   For a\n\nplaintiff to prove retaliation based on an employer’s toleration of\n\nharassment, she must show that the employer tolerated severe or\n\npervasive    harassment       motivated      by    the   plaintiff’s    protected\n\nconduct.    Id. at 26.\n\n            It   is    undisputed     that        Rivera-Martinez    engaged    in\n\nprotected conduct when she wrote the letter describing the incident\n\nthat occurred on September 20, 2002. However, she fails to present\n\nevidence that she suffered an adverse employment action.                  She does\n\nnot allege that she was demoted, transferred, refused a promotion,\n\nor given a negative job evaluation.                   Her claim rests on the\n\nTreasury Department’s toleration of harassment by other employees.\n\nFor her claim to be viable, she must provide evidence of severe or\n\npervasive harassment subsequent to her protected conduct.                      Yet,\n\nRivera-Martinez       fails    to   allege    any    incident   of     retaliatory\n\nharassment following her report of the September 20, 2002, meeting.\n\nShe maintains that she had to continue working with Rivera-Marrero\n\nand insists that being supervised by him “created a very hostile\n\natmosphere,” but she never asserts any further harassing events.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fTherefore, summary judgment is appropriate on the retaliation\n\nclaim.\n\n          The district court properly dismissed without prejudice\n\nRivera-Martinez’s state law claims.    Under 28 U.S.C. § 1367, a\n\n“district court[] may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction\n\nover a claim . . . if the district court has dismissed all claims\n\nover which it has original jurisdiction.”   Appellate review of the\n\nrefusal to exercise supplemental jurisdiction is for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.   Gonzalez-de-Blasini v. Family Dep’t, 377 F.3d 81, 89\n\n(1st Cir. 2004).   In this case, the district court dismissed the\n\nTitle VII federal claim and therefore, in its discretion, declined\n\nto entertain the supplemental state law claim.        No abuse of\n\ndiscretion occurred.   Rivera-Martinez may file her unadjudicated\n\nstate claims before the courts of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n\n                               III.\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district\n\ncourt’s order granting summary judgment to Defendants.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -11-\n\f",

Plaintiff Aida D. Rivera-\n\nMartinez appeals the dismissal of her hostile work environment and\n\nretaliatory harassment claims against the Puerto Rico Treasury\n\nDepartment and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (“Defendants”).\n\nRivera-Martinez contends that while working in the Human Relations\n\nDepartment of the Treasury Department (“Treasury Department”),\n\nspecifically in the Training Center, she was subjected to sexual\n\nharassment by her supervisor, Eduardo Rivera-Marrero.    She claims\n\nthat Rivera-Marrero’s conduct created a hostile work environment\n\nand that Defendants retaliated against her by tolerating harassment\n\nby an employee.   Rivera-Martinez seeks relief under Title VII of\n\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et\n\nseq., (“Title VII”), as well as Art. I, Sec. II of the Puerto Rico\n\nConstitution for breach of her human dignity protection.        The\n\ndistrict court dismissed her Title VII claims and dismissed without\n\nprejudice her state law claim.        For the following reasons, we\n\nAFFIRM.\n\n                                I.\n\n           Rivera-Martinez’s claims derive primarily from two\n\nspecific incidents.   First, she claims that in June 2001, she was\n\n“sexually touched in her left forearm” by her supervisor, Rivera-\n\nMarrero.    According to Rivera-Martinez, Rivera-Marrero “gently\n\ncaressed her forearm in an up and down motion,” and in response to\n\n\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fthis touching, Rivera-Martinez pulled away and angrily declared,\n\n“Do not touch me any more.”\n\n            The second incident took place on September 20, 2002,\n\nwhen Rivera-Martinez and Delia Zayas were called to a meeting in\n\nRivera-Marrero’s office. In that meeting, Rivera-Marrero allegedly\n\nchided Rivera-Martinez for violations of several office procedures\n\nand improper office behavior.     Rivera-Martinez denied wrongdoing\n\nand countered by pointing out irregularities she had observed in\n\noffice procedure and conduct.      Suddenly, according to Rivera-\n\nMartinez, Rivera-Marrero walked over to Rivera-Martinez and grabbed\n\nher.   “[H]e began to twist her torso by placing one hand [on] her\n\nback and the [other hand on] her upper torso [on] the brassiere\n\narea.”   Rivera-Martinez claims that Rivera-Marrero’s hand touched\n\nher hip and buttocks and that Rivera-Marrero “used his hip and\n\npubic area” to push her out of the office.   Zayas did confirm that\n\nRivera-Marrero touched Rivera-Martinez on the arm and on her mid\n\nback “where the bra is,” but stated that she believed that Marrero\n\nwould have behaved the same way with either a male or female\n\nemployee.\n\n            On September 23, 2002, Rivera-Martinez wrote a letter to\n\nthe Secretary of the Treasury Department describing the September\n\n20 meeting and requesting an immediate solution.    Rivera-Martinez\n\nclaimed that “abuse and negligence has been and is being committed\n\nagainst me” but she did not describe Rivera-Marrero’s conduct as\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fsexual   harassment.        The   Treasury     Department     investigated   and\n\nconcluded that no assault had occurred.            Rivera-Martinez filed an\n\nadministrative complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity\n\nCommission on March 17, 2003, claiming that she had been sexually\n\nharassed.\n\n            Rivera-Martinez also asserts that Rivera-Marrero sexually\n\nharassed    other    Treasury     Department    employees.       She    describes\n\nseveral occasions where Rivera-Marrero allegedly abused co-workers\n\nLilliam Rolon and Sandra Ostolaza.\n\n            The district court concluded that Rivera-Martinez did not\n\npresent sufficient evidence that the harassment was based on gender\n\nand that the two incidents alleged by Rivera-Martinez did not meet\n\nthe degree of severity and pervasiveness required to support an\n\nactionable hostile work environment claim. The lower court granted\n\nDefendants’ motion for summary judgment, and               having dismissed the\n\nfederal-based       cause   of    action,    the   court    dismissed    without\n\nprejudice the remaining state law claim.\n\n                                      II.\n\n            We review summary judgment de novo, construing the record\n\nin the light most favorable to the nonmovant and resolving all\n\nreasonable inferences in the nonmovant’s favor.

Id.\n\n              As the Supreme Court noted in Harris, the test for\n\nproving a hostile work environment “is not, and by its nature\n\ncannot be, . . . mathematically precise.”              Harris, 510 U.S. at 22.\n\nTo determine whether an environment is sufficiently “hostile” or\n\n“abusive,” a court must examine the totality of the circumstances\n\nincluding     “the    frequency      of    the   discriminatory    conduct;    its\n\nseverity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or\n\na mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes\n\nwith an employee’s work performance.”                  Id. at 23.       “‘Simple\n\nteasing,’      offhand    comments,        and   isolated   incidents   (unless\n\nextremely serious)” do not amount to a hostile work environment.\n\nFaragher, 524 U.S. at 788 (1998) (quoting Oncale v.

Title VII was not\n\nintended to be a “general civility code”; therefore, conduct must\n\nbe extreme to be actionable.              Id.\n\n              In the case at hand, the district court found that\n\nRivera-Martinez failed to demonstrate that the alleged harassment\n\nwas because of her gender.            We agree.      Rivera-Martinez provides\n\nvery little context for the first incident. She merely states that\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fshe was “sexually touched” on the forearm. In the second incident,\n\nassuming the plaintiff’s version of the facts, Rivera-Marrero\n\ngrabbed her back and shoulder, touched her hip, buttocks, and\n\nbrassiere area, and pushed her out of his office.                 This episode\n\noccurred following a heated exchange between the two and happened\n\nin the presence of another employee.           There is no indication that\n\nRivera-Marrero’s     behavior,      while   inappropriate,      was   sexual   in\n\nnature. Rather, his conduct appears to be the product of his anger\n\ntoward Rivera-Martinez for challenging him and pointing out various\n\nproblems within the office.\n\n           However, discriminatory harassment does not have to be\n\novertly sex-specific in content to be actionable under Title VII.\n\n“Harassing conduct need not be motivated by sexual desire to\n\nsupport an inference of discrimination on the basis of sex.”\n\nOncale, 523 U.S. at 80. The Oncale court emphasized, “The critical\n\nissue, Title VII's text indicates, is whether members of one sex\n\nare exposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to\n\nwhich members of the other sex are not exposed.” Id. (quoting\n\nHarris, 510 U.S. at 25 (Ginsburg, J., concurring)).              In this case,\n\nalthough   Rivera-Martinez         offers    evidence    that    other   female\n\nemployees were mistreated by Rivera-Marrero, she does not assert\n\nthat   women   in   the   office    were    treated   differently     than   male\n\nworkers.   Another Treasury Department employee, Zayas, stated, “I\n\ndon’t see that [Rivera-Marrero] establishes, in general terms, a\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fbig difference when dealing with any male or any . . . female.\n\nBasically he’s equally authoritative one way or the other.”\n\n           Even if the harassment is assumed to be because of her\n\ngender, Rivera-Martinez still fails to show that it was severe or\n\npervasive.     Applying the factors cited in Harris to determine what\n\ncreates an “abusive” or “hostile” environment, Rivera-Martinez’s\n\nclaim falls short.      The harassment Rivera-Martinez alleges was\n\ninfrequent; she cites only two incidents that are over a year\n\napart.    Although an isolated event may create a hostile work\n\nenvironment, it must be “extremely serious.” Faragher, 524 U.S. at\n\n788.     The   inappropriate   behavior   here   does   involve   unwanted\n\nphysical touching, but both incidents were relatively limited.          At\n\nworst, Rivera-Martinez was on one occasion inappropriately touched\n\non her arm and in another instance hastily pushed out of an office.\n\nSee, e.g., Morgan v. Mass. Gen.

Id. at 26.\n\n            It   is    undisputed     that        Rivera-Martinez    engaged    in\n\nprotected conduct when she wrote the letter describing the incident\n\nthat occurred on September 20, 2002. However, she fails to present\n\nevidence that she suffered an adverse employment action.                  She does\n\nnot allege that she was demoted, transferred, refused a promotion,\n\nor given a negative job evaluation.                   Her claim rests on the\n\nTreasury Department’s toleration of harassment by other employees.\n\nFor her claim to be viable, she must provide evidence of severe or\n\npervasive harassment subsequent to her protected conduct.                      Yet,\n\nRivera-Martinez       fails    to   allege    any    incident   of     retaliatory\n\nharassment following her report of the September 20, 2002, meeting.\n\nShe maintains that she had to continue working with Rivera-Marrero\n\nand insists that being supervised by him “created a very hostile\n\natmosphere,” but she never asserts any further harassing events.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fTherefore, summary judgment is appropriate on the retaliation\n\nclaim.\n\n          The district court properly dismissed without prejudice\n\nRivera-Martinez’s state law claims.
