Henwood, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Rosa Emilia Rodríguez-Vélez, United States Attorney, Nelson\nPérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, Chief, Appellate\nDivision, and Germán A. Rieckehoff, Assistant United States\nAttorney, were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         March 23, 2007\n\f            STAHL, Senior Circuit Judge.         Appellant Luis Torres-\n\nVelasquez    (\"Torres\")   raises    two    objections    to   his   criminal\n\nsentence.    Finding no ground for reversal, we affirm the sentence\n\nimposed by the district court.\n\n            Torres pled guilty, in a straight plea, to one count of\n\nconspiracy to commit money laundering, under 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h),\n\nand one count of criminal forfeiture, under 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(1).\n\nTorres's base offense level was calculated at 22, which included a\n\n14-point enhancement corresponding to the value of the laundered\n\nfunds.    At sentencing, the district court accepted the Presentence\n\nInvestigation    Report's   (PSR)    recommendation      of   a     two-level\n\nreduction for playing a minor role in the offense, and a three-\n\nlevel reduction for acceptance of responsibility.\n\n            The court also imposed several enhancements.               First,\n\nfinding that Torres knew the laundered funds were intended to\n\npromote    offenses   involving    the    manufacture,    importation,    or\n\ndistribution of controlled substances, the court added a six-level\n\nenhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2S1.1(b)(1).        Second, the court added\n\na two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 3C1.2 for obstruction of\n\njustice, based on the high-speed car chase that Torres instigated,\n\nprior to his arrest.      Third, a two-level enhancement was imposed\n\npursuant to the requirements of U.S.S.G. § 2S1.1(b)(2)(B).            Torres\n\nwas sentenced at the lower end of the guideline range, to 120\n\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fmonths in prison, three years' supervised release, and a $100\n\nspecial assessment.\n\n           As there was no plea bargain or stipulated version of the\n\nfacts in this case, we draw the following facts about Torres's\n\ncriminal conduct from the government's proffer at the change-of-\n\nplea hearing, the evidence presented at the sentencing hearing, and\n\nthe facts relayed in the PSR.\n\n           In 2003, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n\n(ICE) began investigating the Colombian-based Juan Isidro Toloza-\n\nPeña drug trafficking organization. As part of this investigation,\n\nICE   targeted   the    organization's      system    of   transferring     drug\n\nproceeds from Puerto Rico to the drug bosses in Colombia.                     On\n\nAugust 17, 2004, Torres drove his two co-defendants, Jaime Mendoza-\n\nMedina and Emilio Mata-Soto, to a meeting with an undercover agent\n\nin a parking lot in Caguas, Puerto Rico.             At the meeting, the co-\n\ndefendants agreed that they would return to Caguas the next day to\n\nhand off the currency to the undercover agent, who would then\n\nlaunder the money and remit the funds to Colombia. Torres remained\n\nin the car during the meeting and did not participate in the\n\ndiscussions   with     the   ICE   agent    regarding   the   plan.    On    the\n\nfollowing day, August 18, 2004, Torres again drove his two co-\n\ndefendants to the appointed location for the hand-off.                Noticing\n\npolice activity in the area, the co-defendants proposed moving the\n\nhand-off to a different town, Las Piedras.              The undercover agent\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fagreed to the change, and Torres began driving his co-defendants in\n\nthat direction.         At that point, a marked police patrol unit,\n\nworking with the ICE investigators, attempted to stop Torres's\n\nvehicle.    As an officer approached the vehicle, Torres drove off.\n\nThe police pursued Torres, who led them on an extended high-speed\n\nchase that ended when the vehicle crashed into a bakery in the town\n\nof Juncos.       A search of the vehicle turned up two large bags\n\ncontaining $751,330 in U.S. currency of various denominations.\n\n            The supervising undercover ICE agent testified at the\n\nsentencing hearing that the procedures followed by Torres and his\n\nco-defendants followed the modus operandi for \"pick up\" operations\n\nfor laundering drug proceeds in Puerto Rico.                   According to the\n\nagent,   typical       features   present   in   this       case   included:    the\n\narrangement to transfer a large amount of money to a broker for\n\nlaundering; the request to conduct the transfer in a public place;\n\nthe extensive negotiations over where to transfer the money; and\n\nthe   presence    of    several   people    at   the    hand-off,     to   provide\n\nsecurity.\n\n            Torres's     admitted   involvement        in   the    conspiracy   was\n\nlimited to his driving of the co-defendants to the meeting on\n\nAugust 17 and to the scheduled hand-off location on August 18.\n\nThere was no evidence that he spoke with the undercover agent or\n\notherwise arranged for the money's transfer.                However, because he\n\npled guilty under 18 U.S.C. § 1956, he admitted that he knew that\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fthe conspiracy was to launder the proceeds of illegal activity.\n\nSee 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1) (\"Whoever, knowing that the property\n\ninvolved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of some\n\nform of unlawful activity, conducts or attempts to conduct such a\n\nfinancial transaction which in fact involves the proceeds of\n\nspecified unlawful activity.\").\n\n            In    this      appeal,    Torres    objects    to   two    sentencing\n\nenhancements.         First, he contends that the six-level enhancement,\n\nunder U.S.S.G. § 2S1.1(b)(1), was based on an erroneous factual\n\nfinding by the district court that he knew the laundered funds were\n\nintended     to       promote    offenses       involving    the       manufacture,\n\nimportation, or distribution of controlled substances.                   Second, he\n\nargues     that       the   two-level     enhancement       under      U.S.S.G.    §\n\n2S1.1(b)(2)(B) was applied to him in violation of the sentencing\n\nguideline commentary.\n\n            As to the six-level enhancement, we review for clear\n\nerror the district court's factual finding that Torres knew the\n\nmoney was related to the drug trade.              See United States v. Brown,\n\n450 F.3d 76, 80 (1st Cir. 2006).            The district court's findings of\n\nfact are conclusive on appeal unless we form \"'a strong, unyielding\n\nbelief   that     a    mistake   has    been    made.'\"      United      States   v.\n\nSingleterry, 29 F.3d 733, 740 (1st Cir. 1994) (quoting Williams v.\n\nPoulos, 11 F.3d 271, 278 (1st Cir. 1993)).                  As to the two-level\n\nenhancement imposed under U.S.S.G. § 2S1.1(b)(2)(B), because Torres\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\ffailed to preserve this objection for appeal, we review that\n\nenhancement only for plain error.                  See United States v. Rivera-\n\nRodriguez, 318 F.3d 268, 278 (1st Cir. 2003).                     We will correct a\n\nplain    error     only   where    it     \"seriously       affects    the    fairness,\n\nintegrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"                        United\n\nStates v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 77 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            Torres argues that the six-level enhancement is clearly\n\nerroneous because there was no \"direct or circumstantial evidence\n\nof knowledge\" on his part. The sentencing guidelines direct a six-\n\nlevel enhancement where a person convicted of conspiracy to commit\n\nmoney laundering \"knew or believed that any of the laundered funds\n\nwere the proceeds of, or were intended to promote (i) an offense\n\ninvolving    the    manufacture,         importation,      or    distribution       of   a\n\ncontrolled       substance    or     a    listed     chemical.\"            U.S.S.G.      §\n\n2S1.1(b)(1). Contrary to Torres's assertion, sentencing courts are\n\nnot limited to considering only the facts that the appellant has\n\nadmitted.    See United States v. Bierd, 217 F.3d 15, 23 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).   Rather, courts may draw upon a broad range of evidence for\n\nsentencing purposes, including factual findings set forth in a PSR\n\nand testimony offered at the sentencing hearing.                     See id.\n\n            Here,     the    evidence      before     the       district    court     was\n\nsufficient    to    support    the       finding    that    Torres    possessed       the\n\nrequisite knowledge for the six-level enhancement.                     The district\n\ncourt noted that the evidence showed that the procedures followed\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fby Torres and his co-defendants were typical of the modus operandi\n\nof drug organizations operating in Puerto Rico.           In addition, the\n\ncourt found that Torres had \"prior knowledge of the drug business\"\n\nbecause he had two previous drug convictions, for conspiracy to\n\ndistribute controlled substances and possession with intent to\n\ndistribute controlled substances. Finally, the court was persuaded\n\nthat the large quantity of cash involved in the scheme further\n\nindicated that Torres knew the funds were related to the drug\n\ntrade.        Given this suggestive evidence, we conclude that the\n\ndistrict court's finding of knowledge was reasonable and easily\n\nsurvives our clear error review.\n\n              Torres's second sentencing objection is that the court\n\nerred    in    imposing   a   two-level    enhancement   under   U.S.S.G.   §\n\n2S1.1(b)(2)(B), which advises that: \"If the defendant was convicted\n\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 1956, increase by 2 levels.\"           Torres was indeed\n\nconvicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1956, because he pled guilty to\n\nconspiracy to launder money, under 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h).            However,\n\nTorres argues that the two-level enhancement should not be applied\n\nin his case based on Application Note 3(c) of the commentary to\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2S1.1, which reads: \"Subsection (b)(2)(B) shall not\n\napply if the defendant was convicted of a conspiracy under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1956(h) and the sole object of that conspiracy was to\n\ncommit an offense set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 1957.\"                  Torres's\n\nargument that the exception in Note 3(c) applies to him is plainly\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fincorrect.   Granted, he meets the note's first requirement because\n\nhe was convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h).   However, Torres does\n\nnot meet the note's second requirement because the sole object of\n\nthe conspiracy was not violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1957.1    Instead,\n\nthe object of the conspiracy, as laid out in Count One of the\n\nindictment, was to violate the money laundering provisions codified\n\nat 18 U.S.C. §§ 1956(a)(1)(A)(i) and (a)(1)(B)(i).   Therefore, the\n\nexception contained in Note 3(c) does not apply to Torres, see\n\nUnited States v. Adargas, 366 F.3d 879, 883 (10th Cir. 2004), and\n\nthe district court did not commit plain error in imposing the two-\n\nlevel enhancement under § 2S1.1(b)(2)(B).\n\n          Finding no merit in either of Torres's objections, we\n\naffirm the sentence imposed on appellant by the district court.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Section 1957 criminalizes money laundering where the proceeds\nderive from an unlawful activity, see 18 U.S.C. § 1957, while §\n1956 criminalizes money laundering where the defendant knows that\nthe proceeds derived from an unlawful activity, see 18 U.S.C. §\n1956.\n\n                                -8-\n\f",

Second, the court added a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.2 for obstruction of justice, based on the high-speed car chase that Torres instigated, prior to his arrest. Third, a two-level enhancement was imposed pursuant to the requirements of U.S.S.G. &#167; 2S1.1(b)(2)(B).

As part of this investigation, ICE targeted the organization's system of transferring drug proceeds from Puerto Rico to the drug bosses in Colombia. On August 17, 2004, Torres drove his two co-defendants, Jaime Mendoza-Medina and Emilio Mata-Soto, to a meeting with an undercover agent in a parking lot in Caguas, Puerto Rico. At the meeting, the co-defendants agreed that they would return to Caguas the next day to hand off the currency to the undercover agent, who would then launder the money and remit the funds to Colombia. Torres remained in the car during the meeting and did not participate in the discussions with the ICE agent regarding the plan. On the following day, August 18, 2004, Torres again drove his two co-defendants to the appointed location for the hand-off. Noticing police activity in the area, the co-defendants proposed moving the hand-off to a different town, Las Piedras. The undercover agent agreed to the change, and Torres began driving his co-defendants in that direction. At that point, a marked police patrol unit, working with the ICE investigators, attempted to stop Torres's vehicle. As an officer approached the vehicle, Torres drove off. The police pursued Torres, who led them on an extended high-speed chase that ended when the vehicle crashed into a bakery in the town of Juncos.

According to the agent, typical features present in this case included: the arrangement to transfer a large amount of money to a broker for laundering; the request to conduct the transfer in a public place; the extensive negotiations over where to transfer the money; and the presence of several people at the hand-off, to provide security.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Torres's admitted involvement in the conspiracy was limited to his driving of the co-defendants to the meeting on August 17 and to the scheduled hand-off location on August 18. There was no evidence that he spoke with the undercover agent or otherwise arranged for the money's transfer. However, because he pled guilty under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956, he admitted that he knew that the conspiracy was to launder the proceeds of illegal activity. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(a)(1) (\"Whoever, knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity, conducts or attempts to conduct such a financial transaction which in fact involves the proceeds of specified unlawful activity.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this appeal, Torres objects to two sentencing enhancements.

The district court's findings of fact are conclusive on appeal unless we form \"`a strong, unyielding belief that a mistake has been made.'\" <i>United States v.

As to the two-level enhancement imposed under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2S1.1(b)(2)(B), because Torres failed to preserve this objection for appeal, we review that enhancement only for plain error. <i>See United States v.

We will correct a plain error only where it \"seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v.

Contrary to Torres's assertion, sentencing courts are not limited to considering only the facts that the appellant has admitted. <i>See United States v. Bierd,</i> 217 F.3d 15, 23 (1st Cir.2000).

The district court noted that the evidence showed that the procedures followed by Torres and his co-defendants were typical of the modus operandi of drug organizations operating in Puerto Rico. In addition, the court found that Torres had \"prior knowledge of the drug business\" because he had two previous drug convictions, for conspiracy to distribute controlled substances and possession with intent to distribute controlled substances. Finally, the court was persuaded that the large quantity of cash involved in the scheme further indicated that Torres knew the funds were related to the drug trade. Given this suggestive evidence, we conclude that the district court's finding of knowledge was reasonable and easily survives our clear error review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Torres's second sentencing objection is that the court erred in imposing a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2S1.1(b)(2)(B), which advises that: \"If the defendant was convicted under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956, increase by 2 levels.\" Torres was indeed convicted under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956, because he pled guilty to conspiracy to launder money, under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(h). However, Torres argues that the two-level enhancement should not be applied in his case based on Application Note 3(c) of the commentary to U.S.S.G. &#167; 2S1.1, which reads: \"Subsection (b)(2)(B) shall not apply if the defendant was convicted of a conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(h) and the sole object of that conspiracy was to commit an offense set forth in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1957.\" Torres's argument that the exception in Note 3(c) applies to him is plainly incorrect. Granted, he meets the note's first requirement because he was convicted under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(h). However, Torres does not meet the note's second requirement because the sole object of the conspiracy was not violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1957.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Instead, the object of the conspiracy, as laid out in Count One of the indictment, was to violate the money laundering provisions codified at 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1956(a)(1)(A)(i) and (a)(1)(B)(i). Therefore, the exception contained in Note 3(c) does not apply to Torres, <i>see United States v.

Finding no ground for reversal, we affirm the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Torres pled guilty, in a straight plea, to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(h), and one count of criminal forfeiture, under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 982(a)(1). Torres's base offense level was calculated at 22, which included a 14-point enhancement corresponding to the value of the laundered funds. At sentencing, the district court accepted the Presentence Investigation Report's (PSR) recommendation of a two-level reduction for playing a minor role in the offense, and a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also imposed several enhancements. First, finding that Torres knew the laundered funds were intended to promote offenses involving the manufacture, importation, or distribution of controlled substances, the court added a six-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2S1.1(b)(1). Second, the court added a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.2 for obstruction of justice, based on the high-speed car chase that Torres instigated, prior to his arrest. Third, a two-level enhancement was imposed pursuant to the requirements of U.S.S.G. &#167; 2S1.1(b)(2)(B). Torres was sentenced at the lower end of the guideline range, to 120 months in prison, three years' supervised release, and a $100 special assessment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As there was no plea bargain or stipulated version of the facts in this case, we draw the following facts about Torres's criminal conduct from the government's proffer at the change-of-plea hearing, the evidence presented at the sentencing hearing, and the facts relayed in the PSR.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 2003, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) began investigating the Colombian-based Juan Isidro Toloza-Pe&#241;a drug trafficking organization. As part of this investigation, ICE targeted the organization's system of transferring drug proceeds from Puerto Rico to the drug bosses in Colombia. On August 17, 2004, Torres drove his two co-defendants, Jaime Mendoza-Medina and Emilio Mata-Soto, to a meeting with an undercover agent in a parking lot in Caguas, Puerto Rico. At the meeting, the co-defendants agreed that they would return to Caguas the next day to hand off the currency to the undercover agent, who would then launder the money and remit the funds to Colombia. Torres remained in the car during the meeting and did not participate in the discussions with the ICE agent regarding the plan. On the following day, August 18, 2004, Torres again drove his two co-defendants to the appointed location for the hand-off. Noticing police activity in the area, the co-defendants proposed moving the hand-off to a different town, Las Piedras. The undercover agent agreed to the change, and Torres began driving his co-defendants in that direction. At that point, a marked police patrol unit, working with the ICE investigators, attempted to stop Torres's vehicle. As an officer approached the vehicle, Torres drove off. The police pursued Torres, who led them on an extended high-speed chase that ended when the vehicle crashed into a bakery in the town of Juncos. A search of the vehicle turned up two large bags containing $751,330 in U.S. currency of various denominations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The supervising undercover ICE agent testified at the sentencing hearing that the procedures followed by Torres and his co-defendants followed the modus operandi for \"pick up\" operations for laundering drug proceeds in Puerto Rico. According to the agent, typical features present in this case included: the arrangement to transfer a large amount of money to a broker for laundering; the request to conduct the transfer in a public place; the extensive negotiations over where to transfer the money; and the presence of several people at the hand-off, to provide security.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Torres's admitted involvement in the conspiracy was limited to his driving of the co-defendants to the meeting on August 17 and to the scheduled hand-off location on August 18. There was no evidence that he spoke with the undercover agent or otherwise arranged for the money's transfer. However, because he pled guilty under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956, he admitted that he knew that the conspiracy was to launder the proceeds of illegal activity. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(a)(1) (\"Whoever, knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity, conducts or attempts to conduct such a financial transaction which in fact involves the proceeds of specified unlawful activity.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this appeal, Torres objects to two sentencing enhancements. First, he contends that the six-level enhancement, under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2S1.1(b)(1), was based on an erroneous factual finding by the district court that he knew the laundered funds were intended to promote offenses involving the manufacture, importation, or distribution of controlled substances. Second, he argues that the two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2S1.1(b)(2)(B) was applied to him in violation of the sentencing guideline commentary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the six-level enhancement, we review for clear error the district court's factual finding that Torres knew the money was related to the drug trade. <i>See United States v. Brown,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202261\"><a href=\"/opinion/202261/united-states-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">76</span></a></span>, 80 (1st Cir.2006). The district court's findings of fact are conclusive on appeal unless we form \"`a strong, unyielding belief that a mistake has been made.'\" <i>United States v. Singleterry,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"674592\"><a href=\"/opinion/674592/united-states-v-daryl-e-singleterry/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">733</span></a></span>, 740 (1st Cir. 1994) (quoting <i>Williams v. Poulos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195087\"><a href=\"/opinion/195087/williams-v-poulos/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">271</span></a></span>, 278 (1st Cir.1993)). As to the two-level enhancement imposed under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2S1.1(b)(2)(B), because Torres failed to preserve this objection for appeal, we review that enhancement only for plain error. <i>See United States v. Rivera-Rodriguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200334\"><a href=\"/opinion/200334/united-states-v-rivera-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">268</span></a></span>, 278 (1st Cir.2003). We will correct a plain error only where it \"seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201462\"><a href=\"/opinion/201462/united-states-v-antonakopoulos/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span>, 77 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Torres argues that the six-level enhancement is clearly erroneous because there was no \"direct or circumstantial evidence of knowledge\" on his part. The sentencing guidelines direct a six-level enhancement where a person convicted of conspiracy to commit money laundering \"knew or believed that any of the laundered funds were the proceeds of, or were intended to promote (i) an offense involving the manufacture, importation, or distribution of a controlled substance or a listed chemical.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 2S1.1(b)(1). Contrary to Torres's assertion, sentencing courts are not limited to considering only the facts that the appellant has admitted. <i>See United States v. Bierd,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198986\"><a href=\"/opinion/198986/united-states-v-bierd/\"><span class=\"volume\">217</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir.2000). Rather, courts may draw upon a broad range of evidence for sentencing purposes, including factual findings set forth in a PSR and testimony offered at the sentencing hearing. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the evidence before the district court was sufficient to support the finding that Torres possessed the requisite knowledge for the six-level enhancement. The district court noted that the evidence showed that the procedures followed by Torres and his co-defendants were typical of the modus operandi of drug organizations operating in Puerto Rico. In addition, the court found that Torres had \"prior knowledge of the drug business\" because he had two previous drug convictions, for conspiracy to distribute controlled substances and possession with intent to distribute controlled substances. Finally, the court was persuaded that the large quantity of cash involved in the scheme further indicated that Torres knew the funds were related to the drug trade.
