This appeal by a small number of the\n\nplaintiff    class    challenges    the     2008    approval   of     an   amended\n\nsettlement agreement between the remaining plaintiff class members\n\nand the state in a longstanding class action.                   See Rolland v.\n\nPatrick (Rolland XI), 562 F. Supp. 2d 176 (D. Mass. 2008).                     The\n\noriginal suit, brought in 1998 by developmentally disabled nursing\n\nhome residents on behalf of over 1000 class members, alleged that\n\nMassachusetts did not provide appropriate treatments in appropriate\n\nsettings to them as federal law required.             Here, 43 class members\n\nat one nursing facility object to the 2008 amended settlement under\n\nwhich   many   class    members    will     be   transitioned    to    community\n\nplacements.     They fear it will lead to them being forced out of\n\ntheir particular nursing facility, where they prefer to stay.\n\n            The 2008 settlement resulted from the state's inability\n\nto comply fully with an earlier settlement, reached in 2000. Under\n\nthe 2000 settlement, the state successfully moved many class\n\nmembers   to   the    community    but    failed     to   provide     specialized\n\nservices, including \"active treatment,\" to those remaining in\n\nnursing homes.      See Rolland v. Cellucci (Rolland IV), 138 F. Supp.\n\n2d 110, 120 (D. Mass. 2001).         The parties negotiated the amended\n\nsettlement     in    2008   to   lessen   the      state's   active    treatment\n\nobligations and, instead, move most class members remaining in\n\nnursing homes to the community.\n\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f          The   appealing   Groton   parents,1   who   are   parents   and\n\nguardians, challenged the amended settlement in May 2008 on behalf\n\nof residents of the Seven Hills Pediatric Center (Seven Hills) in\n\nGroton, Massachusetts.   They say their children and wards are more\n\nseverely disabled than the rest of the plaintiff class and would\n\nnot benefit from leaving Seven Hills.        They objected that the\n\namended settlement was unfair and sought decertification of the\n\nplaintiff class, which the district court had certified in 1999.\n\n          The district court found that the amended settlement was\n\nfair, reasonable, and adequate (\"fairness\"), Rolland XI, 562 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 178, and denied the motion to decertify, Rolland v.\n\nPatrick (Rolland XII), No. 98-30208-KPN, 2008 WL 4104488 (D. Mass.\n\nAug. 19, 2008) (order denying motion to decertify).2           The court\n\nentered Rule 54(b) judgment on the Groton parents' objections to\n\nthe settlement's fairness.    Rolland v. Patrick (Rolland XIII), No.\n\n98-3028-KPN (D. Mass. Nov. 20, 2009).\n\n          On appeal the Groton parents untimely attack the 1999\n\nclass certification order.   More significantly, they challenge the\n\n\n     1\n          To avoid confusion, we will call the appellants the\n\"Groton parents\" and reserve the term \"plaintiffs\" for the\nplaintiff class, the appellees in this case.\n     2\n          The parties agreed that a magistrate judge would handle\nall proceedings, Rolland v. Cellucci (Rolland I), No. 98-3028-KPN\n(D. Mass. Dec. 3, 1998) (order keeping case before magistrate\njudge), so we refer to the magistrate judge as the district court.\nThe magistrate judge has issued a number of orders over the years\nand is very familiar with the case. See Rolland XI, 562 F. Supp.\n2d at 177 n.1 (listing decisions).\n\n                                 -4-\n\fapproval of the settlement, objecting that it does not adequately\n\nprotect class members who should not be transferred from their\n\nnursing homes to the community.    We affirm.\n\n                                  I.\n\n            We review for abuse of discretion the district court's\n\ntwo decisions: whether to certify or decertify the class and\n\nwhether to approve the amended settlement.

We review underlying legal issues de novo.\n\nMcKenna, 475 F.3d at 422.\n\n            The parties litigated and settled this case against the\n\nbackdrop of a series of federal statutes3 designed to move disabled\n\nindividuals from institutions and integrate them into society. The\n\nclass plaintiffs sued under three statutes that were passed as part\n\nof   this   \"deinstitutionalization\"    or   \"integration\"   movement4:\n\n\n     3\n          See, e.g., Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Pub. L. No. 93-\n112, 87 Stat. 355 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 29\nU.S.C.); Education of All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, Pub. L.\nNo. 94-142, 89 Stat. 773 (codified as amended at 20 U.S.C. §§ 1405-\n06, 1415-20); Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of\nRights Act, Pub. L. No. 95-602, tit. V, 92 Stat. 2955 (1978)\n(codified as amended in scattered sections of 42 U.S.C.); Fair\nHousing Amendments Act of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100-430, 102 Stat. 1619\n(codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601-19, 3631).\n     4\n          The integration movement argued that the practice in the\nmid-twentieth century of confining the disabled in institutions was\nunnecessary and often harmful.     It believed the best and most\n\n                                  -5-\n\fMedicaid, the Nursing Home Reform Amendments (NHRA), and the\n\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (ADA).\n\n           Although Medicaid5 originally funded mostly institutional\n\nservices   for   disabled   individuals,6   Congress   added   optional\n\nprograms that encouraged states to provide community-based Medicaid\n\nservices to disabled individuals.      See, e.g., Bryson v. Shumway,\n\n308 F.3d 79, 82 (1st Cir. 2002).       Massachusetts participates in\n\nseveral community programs.\n\n           In 1987 Congress amended Medicaid by enacting the NHRA.\n\nIt had found that many states were reducing crowding at state\n\ninstitutions by transferring mentally disabled people to geriatric\n\nnursing facilities, which were poorly equipped to care for them.\n\nH.R. Rep. No. 100-391(I), at 459 (1987), as reprinted in 1987\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 2313-1, 2313-279.     The NHRA limits states to using\n\n\ndignified setting for the disabled was their communities. See,\ne.g., J. tenBroek & F.W. Matson, The Disabled and the Law of\nWelfare, 54 Cal. L. Rev. 809, 816 (1966); see also Ricci v. Okin,\n823 F. Supp. 984, 985 (D. Mass. 1993) (reporting the \"deplorable\nconditions\" the court found when visiting state institutions in the\n1970s).\n     5\n          Medicaid, created in 1965, uses state and federal funds\nto provide medical services to needy individuals. Rio Grande Cmty.\nHealth Ctr., Inc. v. Rullan, 397 F.3d 56, 61 (1st Cir. 2005).\nStates can choose whether to participate in Medicaid and some\noptional programs. See Bryson v. Shumway, 308 F.3d 79, 81-82 (1st\nCir. 2002).   Once states do, they must meet applicable federal\nrequirements. Rio Grande Cmty. Health Ctr., 397 F.3d at 61.\n     6\n          See J. Karger, Note, \"Don't Tread on the ADA\": Olmstead\nv. L.C. ex rel. Zimring and the Future of Community Integration for\nIndividuals with Mental Disabilities, 40 B. C. L. Rev. 1221, 1229\n(1999).\n\n                                 -6-\n\fMedicare funding for nursing home residents found, through a\n\nscreening process, to need the level of care nursing homes provide.\n\nSee 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(e)(7)(D)(ii).\n\n          That screening process is called a Preadmission Screening\n\nand Annual Resident Review (PASARR), and it requires states to\n\nassess whether \"mentally retarded\"7 individuals (1) need the level\n\nof care nursing homes provide and (2) require specialized services.\n\nId. § 1396r(e)(7)(B)(ii).     States had to review all mentally\n\nretarded nursing home residents when the NHRA was enacted and still\n\nmust review new admissions and residents whose conditions change\n\nsignificantly.8 Id. § 1396r(e)(7)(B)(ii)-(iii). Generally nursing\n\nhomes may not admit or must discharge anyone found not to need\n\ntheir services.   See id. §§ 1396r(b)(3)(F)(ii), (e)(7)(C)-(D).\n\n          Title II of the ADA prohibits public entities from\n\nexcluding disabled individuals from entities' \"services, programs,\n\nor activities.\"   42 U.S.C. § 12132.   This \"integration mandate\"\n\nrequires states to place people in the \"most integrated setting\n\n\n     7\n          The NHRA uses the term \"mentally retarded\" to refer to\nindividuals who have mental retardation or \"a related condition\" as\ndefined in another provision. 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(e)(7)(G)(ii). The\nplaintiffs use the word \"developmentally disabled\" to reflect more\nprecisely who the NHRA and similar provisions in this litigation\ncover.   We generally use \"developmentally disabled\" except to\naccurately represent the text of the NHRA.\n     8\n          Originally the NHRA required annual reviews of residents.\nOmnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, Pub. L. No. 100-203,\ntit. IV, 101 Stat. at 1330-198. Congress amended the statute to\nonly require PASARR review if a resident's condition changes. See\n42 U.S.C. § 1396r(e)(7)(B)(iii).\n\n                                -7-\n\fappropriate,\" 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d), often the community.                    See\n\nOlmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581, 597-602 (1999).\n\n                                       II.\n\nA.          Historical Context\n\n            To provide context for the 2008 settlement, we briefly\n\nreview the history of the litigation.            Greater detail may be found\n\nin the district court's opinions.\n\n            The original suit, brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and\n\nTitle II of the ADA, claimed Massachusetts was violating the ADA,\n\nseveral Medicaid provisions, and the NHRA by illegally limiting\n\naccess    to    community   programs      and   ignoring   PASARR     findings.\n\nConsequently, the state was allegedly confining many individuals to\n\nnursing    homes    who   belonged   in      community   placements    and   not\n\nproviding them with specialized services while in nursing homes.\n\nThe district court certified the plaintiff class in 1999.               Rolland\n\nv. Cellucci (Rolland II), No. 98-30208-KPN, 1999 WL 34815562, at\n\n*1-2 (D. Mass. Feb. 2, 1999) (order certifying class).9\n\n            In 2000, the court approved a settlement between the\n\nparties.       Rolland v. Cellucci (Rolland III), 191 F.R.D. 3, 15-16\n\n(D. Mass. 2000).      In the 2000 settlement the state agreed to place\n\n\n\n     9\n          The court certified a single class of \"all adults with\nmental retardation and other developmental disabilities in\nMassachusetts who resided in nursing facilities on or after October\n29, 1998, or who are or should be screened for admission to nursing\nfacilities pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(e)(7) and 42 C.F.R 483.112\net seq.\" Rolland II, 1999 WL 34815562, at *1-2.\n\n                                       -8-\n\fmany class members in appropriate placements, divert people who\n\nwould have been admitted to nursing homes to community placements,\n\nand provide class members with specialized services.              Id. at 7.\n\nThe state was not required to provide community placements to\n\nobjecting class members.      Id.\n\n          Over the next several years, the state satisfied its\n\ncommunity-placement     and   diversion   obligations,    see   Rolland    v.\n\nPatrick (Rolland VIII), No. 98-30208-KPN, 2007 WL 184626, at *1 (D.\n\nMass. Jan. 16, 2007) (order denying noncompliance motion).                 It\n\nplaced about 1,000 class members in the community.               But as all\n\nparties acknowledge, it largely failed to provide specialized\n\nservices to about 800 class members who remained in nursing homes.\n\n          The district court held, and this court affirmed, that\n\nthe 2000 agreement's specialized-services provisions required the\n\nstate to provide \"active treatment\" to nursing home residents.\n\nRolland v. Romney (Rolland VI), 318 F.3d 42, 57-58 (1st Cir. 2003);\n\nRolland IV, 138 F. Supp. 2d at 115-16; Rolland v. Cellucci (Rolland\n\nV), 198 F. Supp. 2d 25, 28-35, 46 (D. Mass. 2002).              Designed to\n\ncultivate independence in the developmentally disabled, \"active\n\ntreatment\"   is   the   federal   standard   of   care   for   residents   in\n\nIntermediate Care Facilities for Persons with Mental Retardation\n\n(ICF/MRs).   See 42 C.F.R. § 483.440(a)(1).        In 2007, the court and\n\nthe parties agreed on a rigorous standard for active treatment\n\nbased on federal ICF/MR regulations.              See Rolland v. Patrick\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\f(Rolland X), No. 98-30208-KPN (D. Mass. Aug. 2, 2007) (order\n\nadopting revised active treatment standards); Rolland v. Patrick\n\n(Rolland IX), 483 F. Supp. 2d 107, 117-18 (D. Mass. 2007).\n\n                The court also ordered the state to better coordinate\n\nwith nursing home staff to ensure class members received active\n\ntreatment in all settings.           Rolland V, 198 F. Supp. 2d at 36-37,\n\n46.   It mandated what came to be called Rolland Integrated Service\n\nPlans (RISPs) for class members, which were \"coherent, integrated\n\ntreatment plan[s] which [would] guide[] [class members'] services\n\nacross all settings.\"        Id.10\n\n                For the state, these federal active treatment standards\n\nwere difficult to coordinate and expensive, especially because\n\nclass members were scattered in nursing homes across the state.\n\nThe court found the state was not complying with its settlement\n\nobligations and with the court's orders four times between 2000 and\n\n2007.        See Rolland IX, 483 F. Supp. 2d at 117-18; Rolland v. Romney\n\n(Rolland VII), 273 F. Supp. 2d 140, 143 (D. Mass. 2003); Rolland V,\n\n198 F. Supp. 2d at 36; Rolland IV, 138 F. Supp. 2d at 118, 120-21.\n\n\n\n\n        10\n          RISPs act as Rolland class members' individual service\nplans (ISPs), which state officials generally must develop for\ndevelopmentally disabled individuals.    See 115 Mass. Code Regs.\n6.20. ISPs identify physical, developmental, and social goals for\nthe person and what services the state will provide to help the\nindividual meet those goals.    Id. 6.23(4).    An ISP team, which\nincludes state service coordinators, individuals, their families,\nand their service providers, reviews these plans at least annually.\nId. 6.21, 6.24.\n\n                                       -10-\n\f              In   January    2008,   a   court   monitor,      whom   the      court\n\nappointed in 2007, Rolland IX, 483 F. Supp. 2d at 119, also\n\ndetermined that the state was largely failing to provide active\n\ntreatment to class members in nursing homes.11               She concluded that\n\nmany nursing homes were not equipped to provide active treatment,\n\nand   class    members   in    those      homes   should   be    moved     to     more\n\nappropriate settings.\n\nB.            The 2008 Settlement\n\n              The state and the plaintiffs negotiated a new settlement\n\nto reduce the state's active-treatment burden in 2008. In the 2008\n\nsettlement, the state agreed to move 640 of the 800 or so class\n\nmembers remaining in nursing homes to community placements over\n\nfour years, based on preliminary assessments of the number of class\n\nmembers who could live in the community.             In exchange, only those\n\nnot moved to the community would receive \"active treatment\" at the\n\nnursing    home.      Class   members     identified   for      transfer     to   the\n\ncommunity would receive any specialized services they were already\n\nreceiving and some additional community-based services in lieu of\n\nactive treatment.\n\n              This appeal primarily concerns the agreement's process\n\nfor identifying class members for community placements.                      As the\n\nagreement required, staff of the Department of Mental Retardation\n\n\n      11\n          Among the 35 class members she surveyed, she found 94\npercent did not receive active treatment as the court had defined\nit.\n\n                                       -11-\n\f(DMR)12 initially placed 666 people on a Rolland Community Placement\n\nList (the List) who they believed could benefit from community\n\nplacement. DMR staff also identified 39 class members who were too\n\nmedically fragile to move and 53 who should not be moved because of\n\npersonal circumstances.\n\n            The agreement allowed DMR to remove people from the List\n\nwhose condition changed, making community placement inappropriate.\n\nAnticipating that many new class members would be admitted to\n\nnursing homes, the agreement also permitted DMR to add up to 160\n\nnew class members to the List and substitute some new admissions\n\nfor class members who died or were removed from the List.\n\n            The agreement provided DMR could move a List member to\n\nthe community if it \"determine[d], through the PASARR process,\n\nthat\" the person could \"be safely served in the community, and that\n\nappropriate community services are, or will soon be, available for\n\nthat individual.\"    It gave class members no express right to veto\n\ntransfer.    The settlement agreement reserved all other rights,\n\nincluding appeals rights, of parties and nonparties.        It also\n\nrequired the parties to notify class members and educate them about\n\nthe agreement before final approval.\n\n            After a hearing, the district court granted preliminary\n\napproval of the amended settlement on April 14, 2008.    Responding\n\n\n\n     12\n          After the settlement, DMR's name was changed to the\nDepartment of Developmental Services.\n\n                                -12-\n\fto concerns the court had expressed during the preliminary-approval\n\nprocess, the parties fleshed out, in a Joint Plan for Transition\n\nServices (the Joint Plan), how the state would conduct \"transition\n\nplanning.\"   Specifically, the Joint Plan, which was part of the\n\nsettlement agreement, outlined how the state would decide during\n\n\"transition planning\" whether \"appropriate community services and\n\nsupports\" were available in the community for List members and what\n\nspecialized services they should receive while awaiting transfer.\n\n          The Joint Plan required coordinators or case managers13\n\nto propose a detailed plan for moving any List member to the\n\ncommunity in a twenty-nine-page planning sheet.14   On that sheet,\n\ncoordinators and a registered nurse would first describe class\n\nmembers' lifestyle, abilities, needs, and medical histories.   They\n\nwould compile this information based on clinical assessments and\n\nprior work with class members and their families.     Coordinators\n\nwould review that proposal with RISP team members, who include\n\n\n\n     13\n           A service coordinator is a DMR staff member who\nsupervises   state-provided   services    for   mentally   retarded\nindividuals. A case manager is the staff member of a University of\nMassachusetts program who coordinates services for individuals with\nother developmental disabilities. See Rolland V, 198 F. Supp. 2d\nat 43, 46. We use \"coordinator\" to refer to both positions.\n     14\n          The planning sheet required coordinators to plot every\naspect of a proposed transition into the community. For example,\nit asked what services and supports the individual would need,\nwhere the person would live, and where the person would receive\nservices. It also asked how the person's financial, health-and-\nsafety, equipment, and medical needs would be met in the new\nsetting.\n\n                               -13-\n\fclass members, their families, representatives from their nursing\n\nhomes, DMR clinical and professional staff, and relevant clinical\n\nprofessionals.     State officials would review the RISP team's plan.\n\nC.         The Groton Parents' Objections to the Settlement\n\n           On May 12, 2008, the Groton parents filed a motion\n\nobjecting to the settlement and to class certification, after the\n\nplaintiffs presented the proposed settlement at a meeting at Seven\n\nHills.   On May 20, they filed a motion to decertify the class.         Of\n\nthe 800 class members affected by the amended settlement, these 43\n\nSeven Hills residents were the only objectors.\n\n           Seven    Hills   is   a   pediatric   nursing   facility   that\n\nspecializes in caring for developmentally delayed children and\n\nyoung adults with significant medical problems. The Groton parents\n\nargued that the differences between their children and the class\n\nrepresentatives made class certification improper and made the\n\nclass representatives inadequate.           They also sought a provision\n\ngiving them the right to veto a transition decision, as the 2000\n\nsettlement had done.\n\n           The court held a fairness hearing on May 22, 2008, on the\n\n2008 amended agreement.     The plaintiffs and the state argued that\n\nthe agreement offered a new chance for most of the rest of the\n\nclass to be placed in the community and better used the state's\n\n\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\flimited resources.15      They insisted that class members had no right\n\nto reject community placement, but they assured the court that the\n\nstate would not move any class members unless it found them\n\nappropriate placements.\n\n          In support, the state DMR commissioner explained how DMR\n\nwould decide whether to move class members to the community.         She\n\nemphasized   that   the    List   was   tentative.   Through   transition\n\nplanning DMR would consider every aspect of a possible move,\n\nincluding whether the move would be safe and whether it would match\n\nthe class member's needs and preferences.            She said the state\n\nwanted to use that process to work with families before anyone\n\neliminated community placement as an option; in her experience,\n\nmany families who initially resisted community placement eventually\n\nfound it very satisfactory.\n\n          One class member and two relatives of class members\n\ntestified about their positive experiences with community services.\n\nBut four Groton parents expressed concern that community settings\n\nwere inadequate, described the high quality of care at Seven Hills,\n\nand asked for authority to decide the best placement for their\n\nchildren and wards.\n\n          Counsel for the state also clarified that the state would\n\nnot move class members \"over their objection, if efforts to come up\n\n\n     15\n          Most of the 92 class members not currently on the List\nlived in three pediatric facilities; the state believed it could\nafford to provide and coordinate active treatment for this group.\n\n                                    -15-\n\fwith the right individualized placement and to work with family\n\nmembers or guardians regarding the merits of the move prove to be\n\nunsuccessful.\" Counsel agreed with the court's assessment that the\n\nstate was reserving the right, in \"extreme\" cases, to decide that\n\ncommunity placement is best for a class member if the person's\n\nfamily was unreasonable.\n\n          The district court approved the settlement as fair,\n\nreasonable, and adequate at the hearing and explained its reasoning\n\nin an order issued on June 16, 2008.      Rolland XI, 562 F. Supp. 2d\n\n176.   In a separate decision, dated August 19, 2008, the court\n\ndenied the Groton parents' motion to decertify the class.      Rolland\n\nXII, 2008 WL 4104488, at *1.      We discuss the court's findings and\n\nreasoning in our discussion below.\n\n          In light of the entry of the Rule 54(b) judgment, the\n\nparties agree we have appellate jurisdiction over the issues\n\nregarding the settlement's fairness; they disagree whether we have\n\njurisdiction over the other issues the Groton parents raise.\n\n                                  III.\n\nA.        Scope of the Appeal\n\n          The   only   judgment    over   which   we   have   appellate\n\njurisdiction, for various reasons, is the Rule 54(b) judgment of\n\nthe district court as to the fairness of the class settlement.      We\n\ndo not reach the Groton parents' arguments that the district court\n\nimproperly certified the class or denied class decertificaiton.\n\n\n                                  -16-\n\f            The class was certified in 1999, but the Groton parents\n\ndid not then appeal within ten days16 after the class certification\n\norder, as they could have done under Rule 23(f).            See Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 23(f).    Nor did they for the next decade seek entry of a Rule\n\n54(b) order allowing them to appeal the class's certification.\n\nThey try to excuse this failure by arguing that they never received\n\nnotice of the litigation or the class and that, in any event, the\n\ndistrict court had some obligation to monitor the defined class.\n\nOn these facts, these excuses are unavailing.17\n\n            The Groton parents did move to decertify the class.            The\n\ndistrict    court   expressly   found   that   they   had    notice   of   the\n\n\n     16\n          Rule 23(f) now gives parties fourteen days to appeal.\nSee Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(f).\n     17\n          It is true that, \"[e]ven after a certification order is\nentered, the judge remains free to modify it in light of subsequent\ndevelopments in the litigation.\" Gen. Tel. Co. of Sw. v. Falcon,\n457 U.S. 147, 160 (1982); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1)(C).\nThat rule does not modify Rule 23(f)'s filing deadline for\ninterlocutory review of a certification or decertification order.\n     The Groton parents try to rely, first, on Amchem Products,\nInc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591 (1997). That case discussed courts'\nobligations when reviewing class certification for settlement only\nand not for litigation. Id. at 620. It does not apply.\n     They also cannot rely on Stephenson v. Dow Chem. Co., 273 F.3d\n249 (2d Cir. 2001), vacated in part on other grounds, 539 U.S. 111\n(2003). In Stephenson the class members suffered exposure to Agent\nOrange; the individuals collaterally attacking the settlement had\nnot become ill from exposure until after the settlement was\napproved and its funds disbursed. Id. at 260-61. The court held\nthat because they did not know they suffered injury from exposure\nwhen the case concluded, they lacked notice and adequate\nrepresentation. Id. Binding them to the settlement through res\njudicata would violate due process. Id. The Groton parents are\nnot challenging this settlement after it terminated; indeed the\ndistrict court let them object to class certification.\n\n                                   -17-\n\fsettlement and heard their objections to the class.    Rolland XII,\n\n2008 WL 4104488, at *6.    Significantly, they failed to file a\n\nnotice of an appeal from that order.   That dooms their attempt to\n\nraise the class certification issue before us.18\n\nB.        Fairness, Reasonableness, and Adequacy of the Settlement\n\n          The heart of this appeal is a challenge to the district\n\ncourt's approval of the amended settlement.    District courts may\n\nonly approve class action settlements that are fair, reasonable,\n\nand adequate.   City P'ship, 100 F.3d at 1043.     They enjoy great\n\ndiscretion to \"balance [a settlement's] benefits and costs\" and\n\napply this general standard.   Nat'l Ass'n of Chain Drug Stores v.\n\nNew England Carpenters Ass'n, 582 F.3d 30, 45 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n          As we understand their briefs, the Groton parents raise\n\ntwo objections to the proposed settlement.   First, they claim they\n\nlacked timely notice of the settlement. Second, they urge that the\n\nsettlement is unfair because it does not give the Groton parents\n\npower to refuse community placement for their children and could\n\nforce their children to leave Seven Hills, against their parents'\n\nwishes or view of their children's best interests.\n\n\n\n\n     18\n          On appeal the Groton parents advance an entirely\nfrivolous standing argument, purportedly based on Article III, not\nraised in the trial court and not within the scope of our\ninterlocutory jurisdiction. There is simply no question that the\ncertified class met all Article III requirements.\n\n                               -18-\n\f1.           Notice\n\n             The Groton plaintiffs do not dispute that they eventually\n\nlearned about the settlement, but they contend that notice was\n\ntardy.   They point out they were notified of the settlement after\n\nit was negotiated and after DMR had created the List.               With earlier\n\nnotice they say they could have negotiated for a provision granting\n\nthem the right to refuse community placement in the settlement and\n\nconsulted with DMR about their children's placement on or absence\n\nfrom the List.\n\n             In    its     opinion    denying     class    decertification,     the\n\ndistrict court found that they had adequate notice of the proposed\n\nsettlement; indeed, plaintiffs' counsel personally explained the\n\nagreement to Groton parents at Seven Hills on May 6, 2008.                 Rolland\n\nXII, 2008 WL 4104488, at *6.                 This conclusion was not clearly\n\nerroneous, and the district court did not abuse its discretion by\n\nrejecting this notice argument as an attack on the settlement.                    It\n\ngave   the   Groton        parents    a   full    and   fair   hearing   on    their\n\nobjections.       The Groton parents also cite no authority saying they\n\nwere   entitled       to    participate      in   settlement    negotiations,     a\n\nquestionable       proposition       given   Rule   23's   provision     for   class\n\ncounsel.     See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(4).\n\n2.           Method for Placing Class Members in the Community\n\n             At bottom, the Groton parents contend the settlement is\n\nunfair because it does not adequately protect class members from\n\n\n                                          -19-\n\fbeing forced to move to community placements.   Their concerns are\n\nthreefold. First, they say the settlement creates a final List for\n\ntransfer and does not require the state to assess class members\n\nindividually or consult with their families. Second, they fear the\n\nsettlement creates a \"quota\" for community placements, requiring\n\nthe state to transfer class members even if doing so is unwise.\n\nThird, they argue that Olmstead and a grandfather provision in the\n\nNHRA, 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(e)(7)(C)(i), give them a right to refuse\n\ncommunity placement and the settlement is flawed because it does\n\nnot expressly protect this right.\n\n          The district court did not abuse its discretion by\n\nfinding the agreement was fair despite these objections.       The\n\nGroton parents misunderstand key aspects of the agreement that, in\n\nfact, sufficiently protect class members.\n\n          In part their reading is flawed because they overlook the\n\nscope of the material that the court appropriately reviewed and\n\nrelied on to approve the settlement and that we may consider on\n\nappeal. That material includes the amended Settlement Agreement on\n\nActive Treatment, the Joint Plan that further elucidated the\n\nprocedures to be followed under the agreement, relevant federal and\n\nstate regulations, and representations that state officials made\n\n\n\n\n                               -20-\n\fabout how they understood their obligations.            See Rolland XI, 562\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 178-79, 180-81, 183-84, 185 n.4.19\n\na.          Finality of the List\n\n            The Groton parents urge us to accept their interpretation\n\nof the agreement: that the List is final and the state will conduct\n\nno further individualized review of class members.               The district\n\ncourt reached, and the record supports, two conclusions that\n\nundermine the Groton parents' reading of the agreement.\n\n            First, the List reflects a preliminary but not final\n\ndetermination that certain class members may be appropriate for\n\ncommunity placement and transition planning is warranted.              Id. at\n\n183. DMR will conduct individualized evaluations during transition\n\nplanning and consider the wishes of class members' families.              Id.\n\nat 180, 183-84.      It will only recommend community placement if it\n\ndetermines that all of a class member's needs, including medical\n\nneeds,    can   be   met    in   an   appropriately   designed   and   staffed\n\ncommunity setting.         Id. at 180.\n\n\n\n\n     19\n          We review the evidence presented during fairness hearings\nwhen determining whether a district court abused its discretion by\napproving a settlement. See, e.g., Dikeman v. Progressive Exp.\nIns. Co., 312 F. App'x 168, 171 (11th Cir. 2008) (affirming the\ndistrict court in part on \"the testimony and evidence presented at\nthe fairness hearing\"); United Auto., Aerospace, and Agric. Workers\nof Am. v. General Motors Corp., 497 F.3d 615, 636 (7th Cir. 2007)\n(reviewing \"live testimony\" from a fairness hearing); Walker v.\nCity of Mesquite, 858 F.3d 1071, 1072-73 (5th Cir. 1988) (noting\nthe district court considered \"oral testimony and documentary\nexhibits\").\n\n                                       -21-\n\f             The settlement limits when DMR may transfer List members.\n\nDMR must \"determine[], through the PASARR process, that a class\n\nmember [on the List] can be safely served in the community, and\n\nthat appropriate community services and supports are, or will soon\n\nbe,    available.\"       During   PASARRs,     the   state   assesses,   in\n\nconsultation with class members and their families, 42 C.F.R.\n\n§ 483.128(c)(3), whether a nursing home, community setting, or\n\nanother placement is best for each individual.         Id. § 483.132.    It\n\nmust decide by reviewing an individual's physical and mental health\n\nand ability to perform daily tasks.        Id. § 483.132(c).\n\n             If the state concludes a community placement is the best\n\nsetting, as the DMR commissioner and the state's counsel explained,\n\nit    will   then   determine   whether   an   appropriate   placement   is\n\navailable during transition planning.          Under the Joint Plan, the\n\nstate must review class members' personal and medical needs and\n\nplan, in careful detail, transition to a \"safe\" and \"appropriate\"\n\ncommunity setting, as the settlement requires.          Coordinators must\n\nreview this plan with RISP team members, including family members\n\nand clinical professionals.       The district court could accept, as\n\nthe DMR coordinator and the state's counsel requested, that the\n\nstate needs time to work with families during this process before\n\n\n\n\n                                   -22-\n\fmaking     a   final   decision    about    community    placement    for   List\n\nmembers.20\n\n               Second, the district court found residents had appeal\n\nrights from a decision by the state contrary to the wishes of a\n\nparent or guardian, which the agreement did not limit. Rolland XI,\n\n562 F. Supp. 2d at 184.       The settlement reserves any other legal\n\nrights class members have; the parties agree this clause preserves\n\nclass members' appellate rights.21\n\n               As the parties agree, the NHRA allows anyone adversely\n\naffected by a PASARR determination to appeal through a state\n\nprocess.       42 U.S.C. § 1396r(e)(7)(F); 42 C.F.R. § 431.220(a)(4);\n\nid.   §    483.204(a)(2).         State    regulations   also   let   Medicaid\n\nbeneficiaries      appeal   decisions      by   the   state   Medicaid   agency\n\n\"regarding the scope and amount of assistance (including, but not\n\nlimited to, level-of-care determinations),\" 130 Mass. Code. Regs.\n\n610.032(A)(5), and imposing \"any condition . . . for assistance or\n\nreceipt of assistance that is not authorized by federal or state\n\nlaw or regulations,\" id. 610.032(A)(7).\n\n\n\n\n      20\n          During transition planning the state will also consider\nwhat enhanced specialized services List members should receive and\nincorporate that plan into their RISPs. Though focused on services\nand not placement, the RISP process is another time the state will\nreview class members' needs with them and their families.\n      21\n          The settlement also expressly creates some appellate\nrights not relevant to the Groton parents' concerns.\n\n                                      -23-\n\f            Class     members          may   appeal    PASARR      and    Medicaid\n\ndeterminations      in     the    state's    administrative       \"fair   hearing\"\n\nprocess.    130 Mass. Code Regs. 456.412(B); id. 610.032(A).                   The\n\nfair hearing involves an evidentiary hearing before an impartial\n\nagency officer who issues a final, written decision.                      See id.\n\n610.012-.086.       Some cases may receive a rehearing.             Id. 610.091.\n\nParties may seek judicial review in Massachusetts state court. Id.\n\n610.092.\n\nb.          Whether the Settlement Creates a Required Quota for\n            Placement\n\n            The Groton parents contend the agreement could force the\n\nstate to improperly transfer class members who belong in nursing\n\nhomes because it creates a \"quota\" for placing 640 individuals in\n\nthe community. This argument overlooks how the settlement protects\n\nclass members from inappropriate transfers and the size of the pool\n\nof class members eligible for transfer.\n\n            Under    the    agreement,       the   state   will   transfer   class\n\nmembers incrementally over four years.              As we explained above, the\n\nstate will carefully review whether a safe, appropriate placement\n\nis available for individuals before moving anyone, and class\n\nmembers may appeal adverse decisions.              The state may also, per the\n\nagreement, keep class members off the List who should not be\n\ntransferred because of medical needs or personal circumstances.\n\nIndeed, roughly half of the residents of Seven Hills had been\n\n\"deemed    inappropriate         for   community   placement,\"     including   the\n\n                                         -24-\n\fchildren of two of the four parents who testified at the fairness\n\nhearing, for this reason.         Rolland XI, 562 F. Supp. 2d at 183.\n\n           The settling parties expect far more class members will\n\nbe   eligible   for   transfer     than   the   state   can   accommodate   in\n\ncommunity placements. The state has initially determined 666 class\n\nmembers could benefit from community placement.             DMR can add up to\n\n160 new nursing home admissions and substitute even more admissions\n\nfor class members who die or are removed from the List.             If too few\n\nclass   members     could   be   safely   transferred,     the   parties   have\n\nrepresented to this court that they will renegotiate the agreement.\n\nc.         Right to Refuse Community Placement\n\n           Finally, the Groton parents argue that the agreement is\n\nunfair because it does not give them an absolute right to refuse\n\ncommunity placement for their children.              They say Olmstead and,\n\nespecially,     a   grandfather    provision    in   the    NHRA,   42   U.S.C.\n\n§ 1396r(e)(7)(C)(i), give them this right and the agreement is\n\nunfair if it does not expressly protect it.                We do not need to\n\ninterpret § 1396r(e)(7)(C)(i) definitively and believe it is unwise\n\nto do so in the abstract.           The settlement is nonetheless fair\n\nbecause it allows individual class members to raise this objection\n\nin other settings, where they can assert any rights they may have.\n\n           The \"grandfather provision,\" § 1396r(e)(7)(C)(i), allows\n\nsome \"long-term\" residents of nursing homes to choose to remain in\n\ntheir current nursing facility.           At a minimum eligible residents\n\n\n                                     -25-\n\fmust have been determined to need specialized services but not\n\nnursing home care during a PASARR and must have lived in a nursing\n\nhome \"for at least 30 months before the date of the determination.\"\n\nId.   The parties dispute when that PASARR determination needed to\n\noccur; we need not resolve this issue.22\n\n           It is indisputable that whether an individual is a \"long-\n\nterm resident\" under the statute is a fact-based inquiry.                       It\n\ndepends on the timing and results of the person's PASARRs and where\n\nthe   person    has   lived.     This    issue   is   best   resolved     in    the\n\nindividualized review process we have described above: during class\n\nmembers' PASARRs, during the transition process, and on appeal.\n\n           In    light   of    these    facts,   it   was    not   an   abuse   of\n\ndiscretion for the district court to refuse to strike down the\n\nsettlement to more expressly protect any rights a few class members\n\nmay ultimately prove they individually have.                  The court could\n\nchoose to approve a settlement that benefits the vast majority of\n\nthe class, including those whom the state does not want to move\n\nfrom Seven Hills, since it adequately protects objectors' rights.\n\n\n\n      22\n           The parties disagree whether the grandfather provision\napplies only to residents who lived in nursing homes and received\ntheir first PASARR before April 1, 1990, or to residents who lived\nin a nursing home for thirty months before a PASARR finding that\nthey no longer need nursing home care. Nothing in the district\ncourt's decision or this decision prejudices class members' right\nto argue they are \"long-term residents\" under either interpretation\nto the state and on appeal. The district court's conclusion that\nclass members had no legal right to remain in nursing homes, see\nRolland XI, 562 F. Supp. 2d at 185, is not precedent on this issue.\n\n                                       -26-\n\f            Olmsted, on which the Groton parents alternatively rely,\n\nadds nothing to their claim.           Olmstead interpreted the scope of\n\nstate authority to retain individuals in institutions under the\n\nintegration mandate of Title II of the ADA.                527 U.S. at 592-93,\n\n602.    But Title II is not the basis for the state's authority to\n\ntransfer     class   members   to     the    community     in   the   settlement\n\nagreement; the NHRA is.23\n\n                                       IV.\n\n            We    affirm    the     judgment       approving    the    fairness,\n\nreasonableness,      and   adequacy    of    the    2008   amended    settlement\n\nagreement.       The Commonwealth has made many commitments to this\n\ncourt about ensuring the fairness of the placement process going\n\nforward, and we expect that they will abide by those commitments.\n\nCosts are awarded to the plaintiffs and the state.\n\n\n\n\n       23\n          The Groton parents do not contend Olmstead or Title II\nmodified the NHRA. As the district court noted, the NHRA actually\nrequires the state to move most individuals from nursing homes if\nthey do not need that level of care. Rolland XI, 562 F. Supp. 2d\nat 185.   The NHRA prohibits federal Medicaid payments to cover\nunnecessary nursing home care for individuals other than long-term\nresidents. See 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(e)(7)(D)(ii).\n\n                                      -27-\n\f",

The\n\noriginal suit, brought in 1998 by developmentally disabled nursing\n\nhome residents on behalf of over 1000 class members, alleged that\n\nMassachusetts did not provide appropriate treatments in appropriate\n\nsettings to them as federal law required.             Here, 43 class members\n\nat one nursing facility object to the 2008 amended settlement under\n\nwhich   many   class    members    will     be   transitioned    to    community\n\nplacements.     They fear it will lead to them being forced out of\n\ntheir particular nursing facility, where they prefer to stay.\n\n            The 2008 settlement resulted from the state's inability\n\nto comply fully with an earlier settlement, reached in 2000. Under\n\nthe 2000 settlement, the state successfully moved many class\n\nmembers   to   the    community    but    failed     to   provide     specialized\n\nservices, including \"active treatment,\" to those remaining in\n\nnursing homes.      See Rolland v. Cellucci (Rolland IV), 138 F. Supp.\n\n2d 110, 120 (D. Mass. 2001).         The parties negotiated the amended\n\nsettlement     in    2008   to   lessen   the      state's   active    treatment\n\nobligations and, instead, move most class members remaining in\n\nnursing homes to the community.\n\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f          The   appealing   Groton   parents,1   who   are   parents   and\n\nguardians, challenged the amended settlement in May 2008 on behalf\n\nof residents of the Seven Hills Pediatric Center (Seven Hills) in\n\nGroton, Massachusetts.   They say their children and wards are more\n\nseverely disabled than the rest of the plaintiff class and would\n\nnot benefit from leaving Seven Hills.        They objected that the\n\namended settlement was unfair and sought decertification of the\n\nplaintiff class, which the district court had certified in 1999.\n\n          The district court found that the amended settlement was\n\nfair, reasonable, and adequate (\"fairness\"), Rolland XI, 562 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 178, and denied the motion to decertify, Rolland v.\n\nPatrick (Rolland XII), No. 98-30208-KPN, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4104488</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.

Supp. 2d at 119, also\n\ndetermined that the state was largely failing to provide active\n\ntreatment to class members in nursing homes.11               She concluded that\n\nmany nursing homes were not equipped to provide active treatment,\n\nand   class    members   in    those      homes   should   be    moved     to     more\n\nappropriate settings.\n\nB.            The 2008 Settlement\n\n              The state and the plaintiffs negotiated a new settlement\n\nto reduce the state's active-treatment burden in 2008. In the 2008\n\nsettlement, the state agreed to move 640 of the 800 or so class\n\nmembers remaining in nursing homes to community placements over\n\nfour years, based on preliminary assessments of the number of class\n\nmembers who could live in the community.             In exchange, only those\n\nnot moved to the community would receive \"active treatment\" at the\n\nnursing    home.      Class   members     identified   for      transfer     to   the\n\ncommunity would receive any specialized services they were already\n\nreceiving and some additional community-based services in lieu of\n\nactive treatment.\n\n              This appeal primarily concerns the agreement's process\n\nfor identifying class members for community placements.                      As the\n\nagreement required, staff of the Department of Mental Retardation\n\n\n      11\n          Among the 35 class members she surveyed, she found 94\npercent did not receive active treatment as the court had defined\nit.\n\n                                       -11-\n\f(DMR)12 initially placed 666 people on a Rolland Community Placement\n\nList (the List) who they believed could benefit from community\n\nplacement. DMR staff also identified 39 class members who were too\n\nmedically fragile to move and 53 who should not be moved because of\n\npersonal circumstances.\n\n            The agreement allowed DMR to remove people from the List\n\nwhose condition changed, making community placement inappropriate.\n\nAnticipating that many new class members would be admitted to\n\nnursing homes, the agreement also permitted DMR to add up to 160\n\nnew class members to the List and substitute some new admissions\n\nfor class members who died or were removed from the List.\n\n            The agreement provided DMR could move a List member to\n\nthe community if it \"determine[d], through the PASARR process,\n\nthat\" the person could \"be safely served in the community, and that\n\nappropriate community services are, or will soon be, available for\n\nthat individual.\"    It gave class members no express right to veto\n\ntransfer.    The settlement agreement reserved all other rights,\n\nincluding appeals rights, of parties and nonparties.        It also\n\nrequired the parties to notify class members and educate them about\n\nthe agreement before final approval.\n\n            After a hearing, the district court granted preliminary\n\napproval of the amended settlement on April 14, 2008.    Responding\n\n\n\n     12\n          After the settlement, DMR's name was changed to the\nDepartment of Developmental Services.\n\n                                -12-\n\fto concerns the court had expressed during the preliminary-approval\n\nprocess, the parties fleshed out, in a Joint Plan for Transition\n\nServices (the Joint Plan), how the state would conduct \"transition\n\nplanning.\"   Specifically, the Joint Plan, which was part of the\n\nsettlement agreement, outlined how the state would decide during\n\n\"transition planning\" whether \"appropriate community services and\n\nsupports\" were available in the community for List members and what\n\nspecialized services they should receive while awaiting transfer.\n\n          The Joint Plan required coordinators or case managers13\n\nto propose a detailed plan for moving any List member to the\n\ncommunity in a twenty-nine-page planning sheet.14   On that sheet,\n\ncoordinators and a registered nurse would first describe class\n\nmembers' lifestyle, abilities, needs, and medical histories.   They\n\nwould compile this information based on clinical assessments and\n\nprior work with class members and their families.     Coordinators\n\nwould review that proposal with RISP team members, who include\n\n\n\n     13\n           A service coordinator is a DMR staff member who\nsupervises   state-provided   services    for   mentally   retarded\nindividuals. A case manager is the staff member of a University of\nMassachusetts program who coordinates services for individuals with\nother developmental disabilities. See Rolland V, 198 F. Supp. 2d\nat 43, 46. We use \"coordinator\" to refer to both positions.\n     14\n          The planning sheet required coordinators to plot every\naspect of a proposed transition into the community. For example,\nit asked what services and supports the individual would need,\nwhere the person would live, and where the person would receive\nservices. It also asked how the person's financial, health-and-\nsafety, equipment, and medical needs would be met in the new\nsetting.\n\n                               -13-\n\fclass members, their families, representatives from their nursing\n\nhomes, DMR clinical and professional staff, and relevant clinical\n\nprofessionals.     State officials would review the RISP team's plan.\n\nC.         The Groton Parents' Objections to the Settlement\n\n           On May 12, 2008, the Groton parents filed a motion\n\nobjecting to the settlement and to class certification, after the\n\nplaintiffs presented the proposed settlement at a meeting at Seven\n\nHills.   On May 20, they filed a motion to decertify the class.         Of\n\nthe 800 class members affected by the amended settlement, these 43\n\nSeven Hills residents were the only objectors.\n\n           Seven    Hills   is   a   pediatric   nursing   facility   that\n\nspecializes in caring for developmentally delayed children and\n\nyoung adults with significant medical problems. The Groton parents\n\nargued that the differences between their children and the class\n\nrepresentatives made class certification improper and made the\n\nclass representatives inadequate.           They also sought a provision\n\ngiving them the right to veto a transition decision, as the 2000\n\nsettlement had done.\n\n           The court held a fairness hearing on May 22, 2008, on the\n\n2008 amended agreement.     The plaintiffs and the state argued that\n\nthe agreement offered a new chance for most of the rest of the\n\nclass to be placed in the community and better used the state's\n\n\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\flimited resources.15      They insisted that class members had no right\n\nto reject community placement, but they assured the court that the\n\nstate would not move any class members unless it found them\n\nappropriate placements.\n\n          In support, the state DMR commissioner explained how DMR\n\nwould decide whether to move class members to the community.         She\n\nemphasized   that   the    List   was   tentative.   Through   transition\n\nplanning DMR would consider every aspect of a possible move,\n\nincluding whether the move would be safe and whether it would match\n\nthe class member's needs and preferences.            She said the state\n\nwanted to use that process to work with families before anyone\n\neliminated community placement as an option; in her experience,\n\nmany families who initially resisted community placement eventually\n\nfound it very satisfactory.\n\n          One class member and two relatives of class members\n\ntestified about their positive experiences with community services.\n\nBut four Groton parents expressed concern that community settings\n\nwere inadequate, described the high quality of care at Seven Hills,\n\nand asked for authority to decide the best placement for their\n\nchildren and wards.\n\n          Counsel for the state also clarified that the state would\n\nnot move class members \"over their objection, if efforts to come up\n\n\n     15\n          Most of the 92 class members not currently on the List\nlived in three pediatric facilities; the state believed it could\nafford to provide and coordinate active treatment for this group.\n\n                                    -15-\n\fwith the right individualized placement and to work with family\n\nmembers or guardians regarding the merits of the move prove to be\n\nunsuccessful.\" Counsel agreed with the court's assessment that the\n\nstate was reserving the right, in \"extreme\" cases, to decide that\n\ncommunity placement is best for a class member if the person's\n\nfamily was unreasonable.\n\n          The district court approved the settlement as fair,\n\nreasonable, and adequate at the hearing and explained its reasoning\n\nin an order issued on June 16, 2008.

First, they claim they\n\nlacked timely notice of the settlement. Second, they urge that the\n\nsettlement is unfair because it does not give the Groton parents\n\npower to refuse community placement for their children and could\n\nforce their children to leave Seven Hills, against their parents'\n\nwishes or view of their children's best interests.\n\n\n\n\n     18\n          On appeal the Groton parents advance an entirely\nfrivolous standing argument, purportedly based on Article III, not\nraised in the trial court and not within the scope of our\ninterlocutory jurisdiction. There is simply no question that the\ncertified class met all Article III requirements.\n\n                               -18-\n\f1.           Notice\n\n             The Groton plaintiffs do not dispute that they eventually\n\nlearned about the settlement, but they contend that notice was\n\ntardy.   They point out they were notified of the settlement after\n\nit was negotiated and after DMR had created the List.               With earlier\n\nnotice they say they could have negotiated for a provision granting\n\nthem the right to refuse community placement in the settlement and\n\nconsulted with DMR about their children's placement on or absence\n\nfrom the List.\n\n             In    its     opinion    denying     class    decertification,     the\n\ndistrict court found that they had adequate notice of the proposed\n\nsettlement; indeed, plaintiffs' counsel personally explained the\n\nagreement to Groton parents at Seven Hills on May 6, 2008.

This conclusion was not clearly\n\nerroneous, and the district court did not abuse its discretion by\n\nrejecting this notice argument as an attack on the settlement.                    It\n\ngave   the   Groton        parents    a   full    and   fair   hearing   on    their\n\nobjections.       The Groton parents also cite no authority saying they\n\nwere   entitled       to    participate      in   settlement    negotiations,     a\n\nquestionable       proposition       given   Rule   23's   provision     for   class\n\ncounsel.     See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(4).\n\n2.           Method for Placing Class Members in the Community\n\n             At bottom, the Groton parents contend the settlement is\n\nunfair because it does not adequately protect class members from\n\n\n                                          -19-\n\fbeing forced to move to community placements.   Their concerns are\n\nthreefold. First, they say the settlement creates a final List for\n\ntransfer and does not require the state to assess class members\n\nindividually or consult with their families. Second, they fear the\n\nsettlement creates a \"quota\" for community placements, requiring\n\nthe state to transfer class members even if doing so is unwise.\n\nThird, they argue that Olmstead and a grandfather provision in the\n\nNHRA, 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(e)(7)(C)(i), give them a right to refuse\n\ncommunity placement and the settlement is flawed because it does\n\nnot expressly protect this right.\n\n          The district court did not abuse its discretion by\n\nfinding the agreement was fair despite these objections.       The\n\nGroton parents misunderstand key aspects of the agreement that, in\n\nfact, sufficiently protect class members.\n\n          In part their reading is flawed because they overlook the\n\nscope of the material that the court appropriately reviewed and\n\nrelied on to approve the settlement and that we may consider on\n\nappeal. That material includes the amended Settlement Agreement on\n\nActive Treatment, the Joint Plan that further elucidated the\n\nprocedures to be followed under the agreement, relevant federal and\n\nstate regulations, and representations that state officials made\n\n\n\n\n                               -20-\n\fabout how they understood their obligations.

Finality of the List\n\n            The Groton parents urge us to accept their interpretation\n\nof the agreement: that the List is final and the state will conduct\n\nno further individualized review of class members.               The district\n\ncourt reached, and the record supports, two conclusions that\n\nundermine the Groton parents' reading of the agreement.\n\n            First, the List reflects a preliminary but not final\n\ndetermination that certain class members may be appropriate for\n\ncommunity placement and transition planning is warranted.              Id. at\n\n183. DMR will conduct individualized evaluations during transition\n\nplanning and consider the wishes of class members' families.              Id.\n\nat 180, 183-84.      It will only recommend community placement if it\n\ndetermines that all of a class member's needs, including medical\n\nneeds,    can   be   met    in   an   appropriately   designed   and   staffed\n\ncommunity setting.         Id. at 180.\n\n\n\n\n     19\n          We review the evidence presented during fairness hearings\nwhen determining whether a district court abused its discretion by\napproving a settlement. See, e.g., Dikeman v. Progressive Exp.\nIns. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">312</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Id. § 483.132.    It\n\nmust decide by reviewing an individual's physical and mental health\n\nand ability to perform daily tasks.        Id. § 483.132(c).\n\n             If the state concludes a community placement is the best\n\nsetting, as the DMR commissioner and the state's counsel explained,\n\nit    will   then   determine   whether   an   appropriate   placement   is\n\navailable during transition planning.          Under the Joint Plan, the\n\nstate must review class members' personal and medical needs and\n\nplan, in careful detail, transition to a \"safe\" and \"appropriate\"\n\ncommunity setting, as the settlement requires.          Coordinators must\n\nreview this plan with RISP team members, including family members\n\nand clinical professionals.       The district court could accept, as\n\nthe DMR coordinator and the state's counsel requested, that the\n\nstate needs time to work with families during this process before\n\n\n\n\n                                   -22-\n\fmaking     a   final   decision    about    community    placement    for   List\n\nmembers.20\n\n               Second, the district court found residents had appeal\n\nrights from a decision by the state contrary to the wishes of a\n\nparent or guardian, which the agreement did not limit. Rolland XI,\n\n562 F. Supp. 2d at 184.       The settlement reserves any other legal\n\nrights class members have; the parties agree this clause preserves\n\nclass members' appellate rights.21\n\n               As the parties agree, the NHRA allows anyone adversely\n\naffected by a PASARR determination to appeal through a state\n\nprocess.       42 U.S.C. § 1396r(e)(7)(F); 42 C.F.R. § 431.220(a)(4);\n\nid.   §    483.204(a)(2).         State    regulations   also   let   Medicaid\n\nbeneficiaries      appeal   decisions      by   the   state   Medicaid   agency\n\n\"regarding the scope and amount of assistance (including, but not\n\nlimited to, level-of-care determinations),\" 130 Mass. Code. Regs.\n\n610.032(A)(5), and imposing \"any condition . . . for assistance or\n\nreceipt of assistance that is not authorized by federal or state\n\nlaw or regulations,\" id. 610.032(A)(7).\n\n\n\n\n      20\n          During transition planning the state will also consider\nwhat enhanced specialized services List members should receive and\nincorporate that plan into their RISPs. Though focused on services\nand not placement, the RISP process is another time the state will\nreview class members' needs with them and their families.\n      21\n          The settlement also expressly creates some appellate\nrights not relevant to the Groton parents' concerns.\n\n                                      -23-\n\f            Class     members          may   appeal    PASARR      and    Medicaid\n\ndeterminations      in     the    state's    administrative       \"fair   hearing\"\n\nprocess.    130 Mass. Code Regs. 456.412(B); id. 610.032(A).                   The\n\nfair hearing involves an evidentiary hearing before an impartial\n\nagency officer who issues a final, written decision.                      See id.\n\n610.012-.086.       Some cases may receive a rehearing.             Id. 610.091.\n\nParties may seek judicial review in Massachusetts state court. Id.\n\n610.092.\n\nb.          Whether the Settlement Creates a Required Quota for\n            Placement\n\n            The Groton parents contend the agreement could force the\n\nstate to improperly transfer class members who belong in nursing\n\nhomes because it creates a \"quota\" for placing 640 individuals in\n\nthe community. This argument overlooks how the settlement protects\n\nclass members from inappropriate transfers and the size of the pool\n\nof class members eligible for transfer.\n\n            Under    the    agreement,       the   state   will   transfer   class\n\nmembers incrementally over four years.              As we explained above, the\n\nstate will carefully review whether a safe, appropriate placement\n\nis available for individuals before moving anyone, and class\n\nmembers may appeal adverse decisions.              The state may also, per the\n\nagreement, keep class members off the List who should not be\n\ntransferred because of medical needs or personal circumstances.\n\nIndeed, roughly half of the residents of Seven Hills had been\n\n\"deemed    inappropriate         for   community   placement,\"     including   the\n\n                                         -24-\n\fchildren of two of the four parents who testified at the fairness\n\nhearing, for this reason.         Rolland XI, 562 F. Supp. 2d at 183.\n\n           The settling parties expect far more class members will\n\nbe   eligible   for   transfer     than   the   state   can   accommodate   in\n\ncommunity placements. The state has initially determined 666 class\n\nmembers could benefit from community placement.             DMR can add up to\n\n160 new nursing home admissions and substitute even more admissions\n\nfor class members who die or are removed from the List.             If too few\n\nclass   members     could   be   safely   transferred,     the   parties   have\n\nrepresented to this court that they will renegotiate the agreement.\n\nc.         Right to Refuse Community Placement\n\n           Finally, the Groton parents argue that the agreement is\n\nunfair because it does not give them an absolute right to refuse\n\ncommunity placement for their children.              They say Olmstead and,\n\nespecially,     a   grandfather    provision    in   the    NHRA,   42   U.S.C.\n\n§ 1396r(e)(7)(C)(i), give them this right and the agreement is\n\nunfair if it does not expressly protect it.                We do not need to\n\ninterpret § 1396r(e)(7)(C)(i) definitively and believe it is unwise\n\nto do so in the abstract.           The settlement is nonetheless fair\n\nbecause it allows individual class members to raise this objection\n\nin other settings, where they can assert any rights they may have.\n\n           The \"grandfather provision,\" § 1396r(e)(7)(C)(i), allows\n\nsome \"long-term\" residents of nursing homes to choose to remain in\n\ntheir current nursing facility.           At a minimum eligible residents\n\n\n                                     -25-\n\fmust have been determined to need specialized services but not\n\nnursing home care during a PASARR and must have lived in a nursing\n\nhome \"for at least 30 months before the date of the determination.\"\n\nId.   The parties dispute when that PASARR determination needed to\n\noccur; we need not resolve this issue.22\n\n           It is indisputable that whether an individual is a \"long-\n\nterm resident\" under the statute is a fact-based inquiry.                       It\n\ndepends on the timing and results of the person's PASARRs and where\n\nthe   person    has   lived.     This    issue   is   best   resolved     in    the\n\nindividualized review process we have described above: during class\n\nmembers' PASARRs, during the transition process, and on appeal.\n\n           In    light   of    these    facts,   it   was    not   an   abuse   of\n\ndiscretion for the district court to refuse to strike down the\n\nsettlement to more expressly protect any rights a few class members\n\nmay ultimately prove they individually have.                  The court could\n\nchoose to approve a settlement that benefits the vast majority of\n\nthe class, including those whom the state does not want to move\n\nfrom Seven Hills, since it adequately protects objectors' rights.\n\n\n\n      22\n           The parties disagree whether the grandfather provision\napplies only to residents who lived in nursing homes and received\ntheir first PASARR before April 1, 1990, or to residents who lived\nin a nursing home for thirty months before a PASARR finding that\nthey no longer need nursing home care. Nothing in the district\ncourt's decision or this decision prejudices class members' right\nto argue they are \"long-term residents\" under either interpretation\nto the state and on appeal. The district court's conclusion that\nclass members had no legal right to remain in nursing homes, see\nRolland XI, 562 F. Supp. 2d at 185, is not precedent on this issue.\n\n                                       -26-\n\f            Olmsted, on which the Groton parents alternatively rely,\n\nadds nothing to their claim.           Olmstead interpreted the scope of\n\nstate authority to retain individuals in institutions under the\n\nintegration mandate of Title II of the ADA.                527 U.S. at 592-93,\n\n602.    But Title II is not the basis for the state's authority to\n\ntransfer     class   members   to     the    community     in   the   settlement\n\nagreement; the NHRA is.23\n\n                                       IV.\n\n            We    affirm    the     judgment       approving    the    fairness,\n\nreasonableness,      and   adequacy    of    the    2008   amended    settlement\n\nagreement.       The Commonwealth has made many commitments to this\n\ncourt about ensuring the fairness of the placement process going\n\nforward, and we expect that they will abide by those commitments.\n\nCosts are awarded to the plaintiffs and the state.\n\n\n\n\n       23\n          The Groton parents do not contend Olmstead or Title II\nmodified the NHRA. As the district court noted, the NHRA actually\nrequires the state to move most individuals from nursing homes if\nthey do not need that level of care. Rolland XI, 562 F. Supp. 2d\nat 185.   The NHRA prohibits federal Medicaid payments to cover\nunnecessary nursing home care for individuals other than long-term\nresidents. See 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(e)(7)(D)(ii).\n\n                                      -27-\n\f</pre>",
