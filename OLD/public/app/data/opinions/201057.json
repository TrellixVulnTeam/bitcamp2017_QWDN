Chapter 11 debtor Holyoke\n\nNursing     Home,    Inc.    (\"Holyoke\")        and    its   official    unsecured\n\ncreditors’ committee challenge a bankruptcy court ruling which\n\nawarded     summary     judgment        to    the      Health   Care     Financing\n\nAdministration (“HCFA”) on Holyoke’s adversary proceeding complaint\n\nthat HCFA’s postpetition efforts to collect prepetition Medicaid\n\noverpayments to Holyoke either constituted preferential transfers\n\nor violated the automatic stay.              We affirm the judgment.\n\n                                         I\n\n                                   BACKGROUND\n\n            In 1990, Holyoke became a participant in the Medicare\n\nReimbursement Program pursuant to a Provider Agreement whereby HCFA\n\nperiodically reimburses health care providers like Holyoke for the\n\nestimated    costs    of     services    they    have    provided   to    Medicare\n\npatients, 42 U.S.C. § 1395g(a), subject to an annual audit aimed at\n\ndetermining the reasonableness of the costs of those services, id.\n\n§ 1395x(v)(1)(A).      In the event HCFA determines that the costs of\n\na provider’s past reimbursement requests were either overstated or\n\nunderstated, HCFA is authorized by statute to make “necessary\n\nadjustments [to the provider’s current reimbursement requests] on\n\naccount of previously made overpayments or underpayments.”                   Id. §\n\n1395g(a);    42     C.F.R.    §§   405.1803(c),        405.371(a)(2),    405.373,\n\n413.64(f).\n\n            In 2000, HCFA determined that it had overpaid Holyoke\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\f$373,639 for cost years 1997 and 1998, and proceeded to deduct a\n\nportion of the overpayment and interest – viz., $177,656.25 – from\n\nHolyoke’s pending reimbursement requests for cost-year 2000.              In\n\nlate 2000, Holyoke filed a voluntary chapter 11 petition, and\n\nthereupon commenced the instant adversary proceeding against HCFA,\n\ncontending    that    HCFA’s   prepetition   deductions     ($99,965.97)\n\nconstituted   voidable    preferential   transfers,   see   11   U.S.C.    §\n\n547(b), and that its postpetition deductions ($77,690.28) were\n\neffected in violation of the automatic stay, see id. § 362(a)(7).\n\n          In due course, the bankruptcy court entered summary\n\njudgment for HCFA, holding that the HCFA deductions from current\n\nreimbursement requests were in the nature of recoupment, and\n\nconstituted neither voidable preferences nor violations of the\n\nautomatic stay.      In re Holyoke Nursing Home, Inc., 273 B.R. 305,\n\n312 (Bankr. D. Mass. 2002).      The district court denied Holyoke’s\n\nintermediate appeal in an unpublished opinion.\n\n                                   II\n\n                               DISCUSSION\n\n          The lone issue on appeal – one of first impression in\n\nthis circuit – is whether the HCFA deductions for a portion of the\n\n1997-98 overpayments it made to Holyoke are more akin to a setoff,\n\nwhose collection normally is barred by the automatic stay, see 11\n\nU.S.C. § 362(a)(7) (staying “the setoff of any debt owing to the\n\ndebtor that arose before the commencement of the [bankruptcy]\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fcase\"), or to a recoupment, which normally is not barred.                    See\n\nUnited Structures of Am., Inc. v. G.R.G. Eng’g, S.E., 9 F.3d 996,\n\n999-1000 (1st Cir. 1993); see also Malinowski v. N.Y. State Dep’t\n\nof Labor (In re Malinowski), 156 F.3d 131, 133 (2d Cir. 1998).                As\n\nthe conclusions of law entered by the bankruptcy court rest upon\n\nits construction of the Medicare Act and the Bankruptcy Code, our\n\nreview is de novo.    See In re Cumberland Farms, Inc., 284 F.3d 216,\n\n224 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n            The   pertinent   distinction      between   a   setoff    and    a\n\nrecoupment is whether the debt owed the creditor (viz., HCFA) arose\n\nout of the “same transaction” as the debt the creditor owes the\n\ndebtor.   For example, if A were to buy a truck worth $1000 from B,\n\nbut A finds that he must expend $100 to put the truck back into\n\nworking condition, A might send B a check for only $900, rather\n\nthan pay B $1000 and await a $100 refund from B.                The $100 A\n\nrecovers by deducting it from the amount he owes B constitutes a\n\nrecoupment because the reciprocal obligations arose out of the same\n\ntransaction, viz., the purchase-sale of the truck. Had B filed for\n\nbankruptcy protection, A could recoup the $100 prepetition debt\n\nfrom B without violating the automatic stay because “it would be\n\ninequitable for [B] to enjoy the benefits of that transaction\n\nwithout also meeting its obligations.” Univ. Med. Ctr. v. Sullivan\n\n(In re Univ. Med. Ctr.), 973 F.2d 1065, 1081 (3d Cir. 1992)\n\n(emphasis   added).     Thus,   in   essence    the   recoupment      doctrine\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fconstitutes     an   equitable   exception   to   the   Bankruptcy   Code   §\n\n362(a)(7) prohibition against offsetting reciprocal debts.\n\n           However, were A to buy the same truck from B, but instead\n\nof sending a $1000 check to B, sends a $900 check (deducting the\n\n$100 B still owes him for a bicycle A sold B earlier), the $100\n\nwhich A has deducted constitutes a setoff because the mutual\n\nobligations did not arise out of the same transaction, but from\n\ndifferent transactions, viz., the sale of the bicycle and the sale\n\nof the truck.    Upon the intervention of B’s bankruptcy proceeding,\n\nBankruptcy Code § 362(a)(7) would prohibit A from effecting such a\n\ndeduction, and A's claim for $100 would be collectible (if at all)\n\nthrough   the   normal   distributive     mechanisms    prescribed   by   the\n\nBankruptcy Code.      See United Structures, 9 F.3d at 999-1000.\n\n           Neither the Medicare statute, the Bankruptcy Code, nor\n\ntheir respective legislative histories expressly treats the issue\n\nbefore us, and other courts of appeals have split on the issue.\n\nHolyoke relies upon In re University Medical Center, 973 F.2d 1065\n\n(3d Cir. 1992), which held that HCFA’s deduction of these Medicare\n\noverpayments constituted a setoff, rather than a recoupment.              The\n\ncourt there reasoned that since HCFA annually pays providers only\n\nfor medical services provided in the current cost year, each annual\n\npayment constitutes a distinct and segregable “transaction,” and\n\nthat the offsets HCFA effected in order to recover overpayments\n\nHCFA had made in prior \"cost years\" – and which necessarily were\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fpaid for entirely different medical services – did not arise from\n\nthe “same transaction” as the payments made to cover the provider’s\n\ncurrent cost-year expenditures. Id. at 1081-82. The Third Circuit\n\nis the only court of appeals which has adopted this rationale to\n\ndate.   In United States v. Consumer Health Services of America,\n\nInc., 108 F.3d 390 (D.C. Cir. 1997), and In re TLC Hospitals, Inc.,\n\n224 F.3d 1008 (9th Cir. 2000), the District of Columbia Circuit and\n\nthe Ninth Circuit have held that recoveries of these Medicare\n\noverpayments    relating     to    previous         cost    years      constitute\n\ntransactions in the nature of recoupment.             These courts note that\n\nsubsection 1395g(a) does not compartmentalize HCFA’s liability for\n\nprovider services into a year-to-year determination, but that it\n\nexpressly defines and modifies HCFA’s liability for the provider’s\n\ncurrent cost-year services as the provider costs incurred in that\n\nyear “with necessary adjustments on account of previously made\n\noverpayments or underpayments.”          See Consumer Health Servs., 108\n\nF.3d at 394.    Thus, “Congress rather clearly indicated that it\n\nwanted a   provider’s     stream   of    services     to    be   considered one\n\ntransaction for purposes of any claim the government would have\n\nagainst the provider.”     Id. at 395 (emphasis added); see also TLC\n\nHosps., 224 F.3d at 1012; In re Slater Health Ctr., Inc., 306 B.R.\n\n20, 25 (D.R.I. 2004).     Moreover, the interpretation favored by the\n\nDistrict of    Columbia    Circuit      and   the   Ninth    Circuit    has   been\n\nembraced by the overwhelming majority of district and bankruptcy\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fcourts nationwide which have ruled to date.\n\n            We likewise accept the majority view, and hold that the\n\nHCFA recovery of the $177,656.25 in overpayments previously made to\n\nHolyoke constituted a transaction in the nature of a recoupment,\n\nrather   than   a   setoff.     As    such,   it   was   neither    a    voidable\n\npreferential transfer nor a violation of the automatic stay.                   Both\n\nthe Medicare statute and the provider agreement – by contemplating\n\nHCFA’s   payment     of   estimated     costs,     corrective      audits,      and\n\nretroactive adjustments or partial adjustments for overpayments and\n\nunderpayments in determining HCFA’s net liability for current cost-\n\nyear services – strongly indicate that the contractual relationship\n\nbetween HCFA and Holyoke constitutes one, ongoing, integrated\n\ntransaction.1\n\n            Holyoke further contends that, even if HCFA’s overpayment\n\nadjustments constitute recoupments, recoupment is an equitable\n\ndoctrine,   and     therefore   the   case    should     be   remanded    to    the\n\nbankruptcy court to determine the appropriate equitable balance to\n\nbe struck as between itself and HCFA. Holyoke notes, for instance,\n\n\n     1\n      In the alternative, HCFA argues that its deductions for past\noverpayments do not implicate the automatic stay, because §\n1395g(a) defines HCFA’s current liability to Holyoke as the amount\nof Holyoke’s current cost-year expenditures less any past\noverpayments.   Thus, the HCFA overpayments never became either\nHolyoke’s property or property of its chapter 11 estate.\nTherefore, these HCFA deductions could not be considered a\ncollection action involving property of the estate against which\nthe automatic stay is designed to forfend. As we conclude that\nthese HCFA deductions were recoupments, supra, we need not address\nthe alternate argument advanced by HCFA.\n\n                                      -7-\n\fthat such recoupments for prepetition overpayments may either cut\n\noff or drastically reduce a bankrupt provider’s most prominent cash\n\nflow, thereby diminishing the prospects for a successful chapter 11\n\nreorganization, and jeopardizing the availability of healthcare to\n\nMedicare recipients.          Holyoke argues, on the other hand, that HCFA\n\nwill not be deprived of all recovery, but likely will be able to\n\nrecover      (albeit     partially)      on   its   overpayment      claims     under\n\nHolyoke’s chapter 11 Plan.\n\n                 We perceive no need for equitable balancing.              First, the\n\nrecoupment doctrine is equitable for the very reason that “it would\n\nbe inequitable for [Holyoke] to enjoy the benefits of [the same]\n\ntransaction without also meeting its obligations.”                         Univ. Med.\n\nCtr.,      973    F.2d   at   1081    (emphasis     added).        Thus,    HCFA    was\n\novercharged for the services provided by Holyoke in 1997 and 1998,\n\nand   in    equity,      Holyoke     should   not   be   allowed    to     retain   the\n\nwindfall. Moreover, to allow these overpayments to become property\n\nof the Holyoke bankrupt estate would mean that its estate might\n\napply a portion of those government-provided funds to satisfy\n\nHolyoke’s other debts, thus violating the manifest congressional\n\nintent that HCFA expend such funds only to defray the costs of\n\nservices provided to Medicare beneficiaries.                  Cf., e.g., In re LAN\n\nTamers, Inc., 329 F.3d 204, 212 (1st Cir.) (noting that inclusion\n\nof government funds as \"property of estate\" would divert those\n\nfunds to the other general creditors of the debtor, rather than to\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fthe purpose plainly intended by Congress), cert. denied, 124 S. Ct.\n\n808 (2003).\n\n             Second, even assuming arguendo that further equitable\n\nbalancing is permissible, the equitable powers of the bankruptcy\n\ncourt do not accord it \"a roving commission to do equity,\"                            In re\n\nLudlow Hosp. Soc'y, Inc., 124 F.3d 22, 27 (1st Cir. 1997) (citation\n\nomitted), nor \"authorize courts to create substantive rights that\n\nare   otherwise     unavailable       under     the   Code,      or    to    expand    the\n\ncontractual     obligations      of      parties.\"     Id.       (quoting      Official,\n\nUnsecured Creditors' Comm. v. Stern (In re SPM                        Mfg. Corp.), 984\n\nF.2d 1305, 1311 (1st Cir. 1993)).                As we conclude that Congress\n\ncontemplated that the Medicare provider agreements would constitute\n\na single, ongoing, and integrated transaction, the equitable powers\n\nof    the   bankruptcy   court      do    not    entitle      it      to    second-guess\n\nCongress’s    implicit     policy     choices.        Both       by   statute    and       by\n\ncontract, the HCFA has the unqualified right to recoup these\n\noverpayments in full, and to return the funds to the public fisc,\n\nwhere they can be used to fund other facilities providing care to\n\nMedicare beneficiaries.       In our view, public policy would be ill-\n\nserved by     permitting    insolvent         providers      –   like       Holyoke    –   a\n\nwindfall at the expense of other Medicare providers which have\n\nmanaged     their    facilities        prudently      to      avoid         chapter    11.\n\nAccordingly, we conclude that a remand to the bankruptcy court for\n\na balancing of the equities is not warranted.\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\fAFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n            -10-\n\f",

For example, if A were to buy a truck worth $1000 from B, but A finds that he must expend $100 to put the truck back into working condition, A might send B a check for only $900, rather than pay B $1000 and await a $100 refund from B. The $100 A recovers by deducting it from the amount he owes B constitutes a recoupment because the reciprocal obligations arose out of the same transaction, <i>viz.,</i> the purchase-sale of the truck. Had B filed for bankruptcy protection, A could recoup the $100 prepetition debt from B without violating the automatic stay because \"it would be <i>inequitable</i> for [B] to enjoy the benefits of that transaction without also meeting its obligations.\" <i>Univ. Med. Ctr. v. Sullivan</i> (<i>In re Univ. Med. Ctr.</i>), 973 F.2d 1065, 1081 (3d Cir.1992) (emphasis added). Thus, in essence the recoupment doctrine constitutes an equitable exception to the Bankruptcy Code &#167; 362(a)(7) prohibition against offsetting reciprocal debts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, were A to buy the same truck from B, but instead of sending a $1000 check to B, sends a $900 check (deducting the $100 B still owes him for a bicycle A sold B earlier), the $100 which A has deducted constitutes a setoff because the mutual obligations did not arise out of the same transaction, but from different transactions, <i>viz.,</i> the sale of the bicycle and the sale of the truck. Upon the intervention of B's bankruptcy proceeding, Bankruptcy Code &#167; 362(a)(7) would prohibit A from effecting such a deduction, and A's claim for $100 would be collectible (if at all) through the normal distributive mechanisms prescribed by the Bankruptcy Code. <i>See United Structures,</i> 9 F.3d at 999-1000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither the Medicare statute, the Bankruptcy Code, nor their respective legislative histories expressly treats the issue before us, and other courts of appeals have split on the issue. Holyoke relies upon <i>In re University Medical Center,</i> 973 F.2d 1065 (3d Cir.1992), which held that HCFA's deduction of these Medicare overpayments constituted a setoff, rather than a recoupment. The court there reasoned that since HCFA annually pays providers only for medical services provided in the current cost year, each annual payment constitutes a distinct and segregable \"transaction,\" and that the offsets HCFA effected in order to recover overpayments HCFA had made in prior \"cost years\" &#8212; and which necessarily were paid for entirely <i>different</i> medical services &#8212; did not arise from the \"same transaction\" as the payments made to cover the provider's current cost-year expenditures. <i>Id.</i> at 1081-82. The Third Circuit is the only court of appeals which has adopted this rationale to date. In <i>United States v. Consumer Health Services of America, Inc.,</i> 108 F.3d 390 (D.C.Cir.1997), and <i>In re TLC Hospitals, Inc.,</i> 224 F.3d 1008 (9th Cir.2000), the District of Columbia Circuit and the Ninth Circuit have held that recoveries of these Medicare overpayments relating to previous cost years constitute transactions in the nature of recoupment. These courts note that subsection 1395g(a) does not compartmentalize HCFA's liability for provider services into a year-to-year determination, but that it expressly defines and modifies HCFA's liability for the provider's current cost-year services as the provider costs incurred in that year \"with necessary adjustments on account of previously made overpayments or underpayments.\" <i>See Consumer Health Servs.,</i> 108 F.3d at 394. Thus, \"Congress rather clearly indicated that it wanted a provider's <i>stream of services</i> to be considered <i>one transaction</i> for purposes of any claim the government would have against the provider.\" <i>Id.</i> at 395 (emphasis added); <i>see also TLC Hosps.,</i> 224 F.3d at 1012; <i>In re Slater Health Ctr., Inc.,</i> 306 B.R. 20, 25 (D.R.I.2004). Moreover, the interpretation favored by the District of Columbia Circuit and the Ninth Circuit has been embraced by the overwhelming majority of district and bankruptcy courts nationwide which have ruled to date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We likewise accept the majority view, and hold that the HCFA recovery of the $177,656.25 in overpayments previously made to Holyoke constituted a transaction in the nature of a recoupment, rather than a setoff. As such, it was neither a voidable preferential transfer nor a violation of the automatic stay. Both the Medicare statute and the provider agreement &#8212; by contemplating HCFA's payment of estimated costs, corrective audits, and retroactive adjustments or partial adjustments for overpayments and underpayments in determining HCFA's net liability for current cost-year services &#8212; strongly indicate that the contractual relationship between HCFA and Holyoke constitutes one, ongoing, integrated transaction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Holyoke further contends that, even if HCFA's overpayment adjustments constitute recoupments, recoupment is an equitable doctrine, and therefore the case should be remanded to the bankruptcy court to determine the appropriate equitable balance to be struck as between itself and HCFA. Holyoke notes, for instance, that such recoupments for prepetition overpayments may either cut off or drastically reduce a bankrupt provider's most prominent cash flow, thereby diminishing the prospects for a successful chapter 11 reorganization, and jeopardizing the availability of healthcare to Medicare recipients. Holyoke argues, on the other hand, that HCFA will not be deprived of all recovery, but likely will be able to recover (albeit partially) on its overpayment claims under Holyoke's chapter 11 Plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We perceive no need for equitable balancing. First, the recoupment doctrine is equitable for the very reason that \"it would be <i>inequitable</i> for [Holyoke] to enjoy the benefits of [the same] transaction without also meeting its obligations.\" <i>Univ. Med. Ctr.,</i> 973 F.2d at 1081 (emphasis added). Thus, HCFA was <i>overcharged</i> for the services provided by Holyoke in 1997 and 1998, and in equity, Holyoke should not be allowed to retain the windfall. Moreover, to allow these overpayments to become property of the Holyoke bankrupt estate would mean that its estate might apply a portion of those government-provided funds to satisfy Holyoke's other debts, thus violating the manifest congressional intent that HCFA expend such funds only to defray the costs of services provided to Medicare beneficiaries. <i>Cf., e.g., In re Lan Tamers, Inc.,</i> 329 F.3d 204, 212 (1st Cir.) (noting that inclusion of government funds as \"property of estate\" would divert those funds to the other general creditors of the debtor, rather than to the purpose plainly intended by Congress), <i>cert. denied,</i> 540 U.S. 1047, 124 S.Ct. 808, 157 L.Ed.2d 695 (2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, even assuming <i>arguendo</i> that further equitable balancing is permissible, the equitable powers of the bankruptcy court do not accord it \"a roving commission to do equity,\" <i>In re Ludlow Hosp. Soc'y, Inc.,</i> 124 F.3d 22, 27 (1st Cir.1997) (citation omitted), nor \"authorize courts to create substantive rights that are otherwise unavailable under the Code, or to expand the contractual obligations of parties.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Official, Unsecured Creditors' Comm. v. Stern</i> (<i>In re SPM Mfg. Corp.</i>), 984 F.2d 1305, 1311 (1st Cir.1993)). As we conclude that Congress contemplated that the Medicare provider agreements would constitute a single, ongoing, and integrated transaction, the equitable powers of the bankruptcy court do not entitle it to second-guess Congress's implicit policy choices. Both by statute and by contract, the HCFA has the unqualified right to recoup these overpayments <i>in full,</i> and to return the funds to the public fisc, where they can be used to fund other facilities providing care to Medicare beneficiaries. In our view, public policy would be ill-served by permitting insolvent providers &#8212; like Holyoke &#8212; a windfall at the expense of other Medicare providers which have managed their facilities prudently to avoid chapter 11. Accordingly, we conclude that a remand to the bankruptcy court for a balancing of the equities is not warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>AFFIRMED.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In the alternative, HCFA argues that its deductions for past overpayments do not implicate the automatic stay, because &#167; 1395g(a) defines HCFA's current liability to Holyoke as the amount of Holyoke's current cost-year expenditures<i>less any past overpayments.</i> Thus, the HCFA overpayments never became either Holyoke's property or property of its chapter 11 estate. Therefore, these HCFA deductions could not be considered a collection action involving property of the estate against which the automatic stay is designed to forfend. As we conclude that these HCFA deductions were recoupments, <i>supra,</i> we need not address the alternate argument advanced by HCFA.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

In the event HCFA determines that the costs of a provider's past reimbursement requests were either overstated or understated, HCFA is authorized by statute to make \"necessary adjustments [to the provider's current reimbursement requests] on account of previously made overpayments or underpayments.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1395g(a); 42 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 405.1803(c), 405.371(a)(2), 405.373, 413.64(f).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 2000, HCFA determined that it had overpaid Holyoke $373,639 for cost years 1997 and 1998, and proceeded to deduct a portion of the overpayment and interest &#8212; <i>viz.,</i> $177,656.25 &#8212; from Holyoke's pending reimbursement requests for cost-year 2000. In late 2000, Holyoke filed a voluntary chapter 11 petition, and thereupon commenced the instant adversary proceeding against HCFA, contending that HCFA's prepetition deductions ($99,965.97) constituted voidable preferential transfers, <i>see</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167; 547(b), and that its postpetition deductions ($77,690.28) were effected in violation of the automatic stay, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 362(a)(7).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, the bankruptcy court entered summary judgment for HCFA, holding that the HCFA deductions from current reimbursement requests were in the nature of recoupment, and constituted neither voidable preferences nor violations of the automatic stay. <i>In re Holyoke Nursing Home, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1534098\"><a href=\"/opinion/1534098/in-re-holyoke-nursing-home-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">273</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">305</span></a></span>, 312 (Bankr.D.Mass.2002).

In our view, public policy would be ill-served by permitting insolvent providers &#8212; like Holyoke &#8212; a windfall at the expense of other Medicare providers which have managed their facilities prudently to avoid chapter 11. Accordingly, we conclude that a remand to the bankruptcy court for a balancing of the equities is not warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>AFFIRMED.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In the alternative, HCFA argues that its deductions for past overpayments do not implicate the automatic stay, because &#167; 1395g(a) defines HCFA's current liability to Holyoke as the amount of Holyoke's current cost-year expenditures<i>less any past overpayments.</i> Thus, the HCFA overpayments never became either Holyoke's property or property of its chapter 11 estate. Therefore, these HCFA deductions could not be considered a collection action involving property of the estate against which the automatic stay is designed to forfend. As we conclude that these HCFA deductions were recoupments, <i>supra,</i> we need not address the alternate argument advanced by HCFA.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
