Nancy Gertner, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                        Lipez, Circuit Judge,\n                    Selya, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Lawrence A. Vogelman and Nixon, Raiche, Vogelman Barry &\nSlawsky, P.A., on brief for appellant.\n     William D. Weinreb, Assistant United States Attorney, and\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, on motion for summary\ndisposition.\n\n\n\n                               June 27, 2008\n\f       Per Curiam.          Pending before the court is the government's\n\nmotion for summary disposition.             Following a bench trial, Sabarian\n\nTaba       was   convicted     of   conspiracy    to   distribute     cocaine,    in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841 and 846, and possession with intent\n\nto distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1).\n\nMoreover, the indictment alleged, and the district court found,\n\nthat Taba was subject to a 240-month mandatory minimum sentence\n\npursuant         to   21   U.S.C.   §   841(b)(1)(A)   because   the   conspiracy\n\ninvolved more than five kilograms of cocaine and Taba was shown to\n\nhave a prior felony conviction.              He was sentenced to 240 months'\n\nimprisonment. As there are no substantial issues presented by this\n\nappeal, we grant the government's motion and summarily affirm the\n\njudgment of the district court.\n\n       Taba       argues     that   the    evidence    adduced   at    trial     was\n\ninsufficient for the district court to determine that Taba was\n\nresponsible for five kilograms of cocaine as part of the charged\n\nconspiracy and, consequently, that the district court erred by\n\nfinding beyond a reasonable doubt that Taba was eligible for the\n\nenhanced penalty under § 841(b)(1)(A).1                While we require proof\n\n\n\n       1\n      While Taba actually asserts that his conviction should be\nreversed, even assuming arguendo that Taba's factual arguments are\ncorrect, he is not entitled to a reversal of his conviction--Taba\nconfuses criminal liability with sentencing issues.     See United\nStates v. Yeje-Cabrera, 430 F.3d 1, 13 (1st Cir. 2005) (explaining\nthat a defendant may be convicted of drug conspiracy even where the\nquantity proven at trial is less than that alleged in the\nindictment).\n\n                                          - 2 -\n\fbeyond a reasonable doubt regarding the drug quantity attributable\n\nto the conspiracy as a whole to support an enhancement under\n\n§ 841(b)(1)(A), see United States v. De La Cruz, 514 F.3d 121, 136-\n\n37   &   n.7   (1st    Cir.    2008),    determinations    regarding      the   drug\n\nquantity attributable to specific conspirators may be made by the\n\nsentencing court based on a preponderance standard.                    See United\n\nStates v. González-Vélez, 466 F.3d 27, 40-41 (1st Cir. 2006).                    To\n\nthe extent that Taba challenges the district court's findings\n\nregarding the drugs attributable to the conspiracy as a whole,\n\n\"[w]e    review       challenges    to   the     sufficiency   of   the   evidence\n\nfollowing bench trials de novo, evaluating whether, after viewing\n\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any\n\nrational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of\n\nthe crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\"               United States v. Meléndez-\n\nTorres, 420 F.3d 45, 48-49 (1st Cir. 2005) (citation omitted).                    In\n\ncontrast, the court reviews a district court's findings of fact\n\nregarding      drug    quantity    during      sentencing--i.e.,    the   quantity\n\nattributable directly to Taba--for clear error.                See United States\n\nv. Vázquez-Rivera, 470 F.3d 443, 446 (1st Cir. 2006), cert. denied,\n\n127 S. Ct. 2951 (2007).            Although it is somewhat unclear whether\n\nTaba     challenges      the   quantity     of    drugs   attributable     to   the\n\nconspiracy as a whole or himself specifically, the same evidence\n\nforms the basis for our conclusion in either instance.                          The\n\ngovernment presented ample evidence from which the district court\n\n\n                                         - 3 -\n\fcould   conclude,      whatever    the    standard,    that   more    than   five\n\nkilograms of cocaine were attributable to Taba as part of the\n\ncharged conspiracy.\n\n      We briefly summarize the evidence adduced at trial.                First,\n\nTaba stipulated that 2,989 grams of cocaine were recovered from his\n\nvehicle upon his arrest.          Second, Taba admitted to Federal Bureau\n\nof Investigation Agent John Woudenberg that he had known Frederick\n\nMartineau, a codefendant, for \"quite some time,\" and that he sold\n\nhim kilogram quantities of cocaine \"from time to time on a monthly\n\nbasis.\"    Taba also confessed to Agent Woudenberg that he typically\n\npurchased two kilograms of cocaine per month from his supplier in\n\nNew York for resale to Martineau or other individuals.                Third, in\n\na   recorded      conversation    with    another    drug   dealer,   Martineau\n\nindicated that his drug distribution relationship with Taba had\n\nspanned the course of \"many years.\"                 Fourth, wiretap evidence\n\nsuggests     at    least   two    prior   transactions      between   Taba   and\n\nMartineau.\n\n      On appeal, Taba argues that two of the kilograms of cocaine\n\nfound in his vehicle were destined for buyers who were not part of\n\nthe conspiracy charged in the indictment.                   \"Whether a single\n\nconspiracy exists is a question of fact for the [finder of fact].\"\n\nUnited States v. Escobar-Figuero, 454 F.3d 40, 48 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\nOur case law makes plain that \"[e]ach coconspirator need not know\n\nof or have contact with all other members, nor must they know all\n\n\n                                      - 4 -\n\fof the details of the conspiracy or participate in every act in\n\nfurtherance of it.\" Id. (citation omitted). Rather, the finder of\n\nfact \"may infer an agreement circumstantially by evidence of, inter\n\nalia, a common purpose (such as a purpose to sell illicit drugs),\n\noverlap of participants, and interdependence of various elements in\n\nthe overall plan.\"    Id. (citation omitted).\n\n     Here, the common purpose of the conspiracy was to distribute\n\ncocaine;    the   different   sales    involved   several    of   the   same\n\nparticipants, i.e., Taba and his own suppliers; and each individual\n\nsale was predicated upon the continued flow of cocaine down the\n\nsame supply chain, demonstrating interdependence.           See id. at 48-\n\n49; United States v. Rivera-Ruiz, 244 F.3d 263, 268 (1st Cir.\n\n2001); United States v. Portela, 167 F.3d 687, 697 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\nThus, the district court did not clearly err by attributing all of\n\nthe cocaine discovered in Taba's vehicle at the time of his arrest\n\nto his role in the conspiracy alleged by the indictment.\n\n     Likewise, the district court did not clearly err by concluding\n\nthat Taba was responsible for more than five kilograms of cocaine\n\nfor his role in the conspiracy even if two of the kilograms of\n\ncocaine found in his vehicle were attributable to his participation\n\nin separate, unindicted conspiracies.         A fact-finder may rely on\n\ncircumstantial    evidence    in   drawing   conclusions    regarding   drug\n\nquantity.    See United States v. Hall, 434 F.3d 42, 61 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).   As detailed above, the evidence adduced at trial revealed\n\n\n                                    - 5 -\n\fa lengthy, ongoing cocaine distribution relationship between Taba\n\nand Martineau.   The district court, as the finder of fact, was\n\nentitled to infer that Taba was responsible for more than five\n\nkilograms of cocaine as part of the charged conspiracy.\n\n     Accordingly, Taba's challenge presents no substantial issues\n\nfor appellate review and summary disposition is warranted.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              - 6 -\n\f",
