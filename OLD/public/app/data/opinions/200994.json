Jose Alberto Nuñez Gomez, then three years old,\n\nwas injured on March 21, 1999 when he placed his hand inside an\n\nunlocked electrical box owned by Puerto Rico Electrical Power\n\nAuthority (\"PREPA\") and located near a Burger King restaurant\n\noperated by Caribbean Restaurants.                     The child and his parents\n\nsued the electric company and Caribbean Restaurants, together\n\nwith various other defendants, for negligence under Puerto Rico's\n\ncivil code.      PREPA cross-claimed against Caribbean Restaurants.\n\n      At trial, the district court granted Caribbean Restaurants'\n\nmotions    for       judgment    as   a    matter      of   law   against    both     the\n\nplaintiffs and PREPA, ruling that there was insufficient evidence\n\nupon which       a    jury    could   find   that      Caribbean    Restaurants       had\n\nbreached a duty of care.                  The jury found PREPA to have been\n\nnegligent and awarded damages.                   After the verdict but before\n\njudgment    was        entered    against        it,   PREPA      settled    with     the\n\nplaintiffs.          Now PREPA appeals the judgments as a matter of law\n\nin   Caribbean        Restaurants'    favor,      apparently       seeking   to     force\n\nCaribbean Restaurants to contribute to the settlement payments to\n\nthe plaintiffs.         The plaintiffs are not involved in this appeal.\n\n      Orders granting motions for judgment as a matter of law are\n\nreviewed de novo.            Hochen v. Bobst Group, Inc., 290 F.3d 446, 453\n\n(1st Cir. 2002).

Id.    A district court's\n\norder of judgment as a matter of law will be affirmed only if\n\n\"applying     these      standards,   the      evidence     does    not   permit    a\n\nreasonable jury to find in favor of appellants.\"                   Id.\n\n    Having reviewed the record in the light of this standard of\n\nreview, this court is fully satisfied that the district court\n\nacted appropriately in granting Caribbean Restaurants' motions\n\nfor judgment as a matter of law.
