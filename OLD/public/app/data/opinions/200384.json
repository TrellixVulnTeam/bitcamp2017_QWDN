Burton, Attorney, U.S.\nPostal Service, on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n                          March 19, 2003\n\f           SELYA, Circuit Judge.    This appeal arises out of a civil\n\naction   brought   by   plaintiff-appellant    Jorge     Luis    Tapia-Tapia\n\n(Tapia), a longtime postal worker, against the Postmaster General,\n\nthe United States, and the United States Postal Service.1                  (We\n\nsometimes refer to the defendants-appellees, collectively, as the\n\nPostal Service.)     In his amended complaint, the appellant alleges\n\nviolations of the First and Fifth Amendments to the United States\n\nConstitution   and   several   federal    statutes,     including   the    Age\n\nDiscrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. §§ 621-634.\n\nPertinently, he claims that the Postal Service engaged in a pattern\n\nof discriminatory harassment toward him \"because of [his] age and\n\nhis exercise of his freedom of speech right, and his refusal to\n\nretire.\"   The appellees moved for brevis disposition, averring,\n\ninter alia, that the appellant had failed to comply with applicable\n\nadministrative requirements prior to suing for age discrimination,\n\nand that his remaining claims were precluded for a variety of other\n\nreasons.\n\n           The district court granted the motion in part.              Tapia\n\nTapia v. Henderson, Civ. No. 99-2408, slip op. (D.P.R. Apr. 25,\n\n2001) (unpublished).       Only   two    aspects   of   that    decision   are\n\n\n\n     1\n      As to the first named defendant, the appellant originally\nsued William J. Henderson in his official capacity as Postmaster\nGeneral. Time has passed, however, and John E. Potter now occupies\nthat office. By operation of law, Potter has been substituted for\nHenderson as a party defendant. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(d)(1); Fed.\nR. App. P. 43(c)(2).\n\n                                   -2-\n\frelevant to the issues on appeal.2          First, the court dismissed the\n\nappellant's constitutional claims on the ground that the ADEA\n\nprovides the exclusive remedy for age discrimination.              Id. at 3.\n\nSecond, the court ordered the appellant to show cause why his ADEA\n\nclaim should not be dismissed for failure to comply with statutory\n\npreconditions to suit.    Id. at 3-4.\n\n            The appellant did not respond to the show-cause order,\n\nand the court proceeded to dismiss the age discrimination claim.\n\nTapia Tapia v. Henderson, No. 99-2408, slip op. (D.P.R. May 14,\n\n2002)    (unpublished).       The    appellant   sought      reconsideration,\n\nmaintaining that he was not required to comply with the ADEA's\n\npreconditions    to   suit.         The   district   court    rejected   this\n\nproposition, reaffirmed the order of dismissal, and directed the\n\nentry of final judgment.       Tapia Tapia v. Henderson, No. 99-2408,\n\nslip op. (D.P.R. June 28, 2002) (unpublished).            This timely appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n            The relevant facts are largely undisputed.           At all times\n\nmaterial hereto, the appellant worked as a mechanic for the Postal\n\nService.    As such, he was represented by a local union, which had\n\na collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with the Postal Service.\n\nThe CBA created a grievance/arbitration procedure through which\n\nemployees within the bargaining unit (like the appellant) might\n\n\n     2\n      The court dismissed several of the appellant's other claims\nas well, but those portions of the court's decision have not been\nchallenged on appeal. Thus, we need not discuss them here.\n\n                                      -3-\n\fseek redress for employment-related harms.               Although the appellant\n\nhad used this procedure in the past, he did not attempt to grieve\n\nthe matters of which he complains in the instant action (the acts\n\nconstituting the so-called pattern of discriminatory harassment).\n\nMoreover,    he    never     provided   the   Equal   Employment      Opportunity\n\nCommission (EEOC) with prior notice of his intent to sue.3\n\n             Against   this       backdrop,   we   address      the   appellant's\n\nspecific assignments of error, looking first to his ADEA claim.\n\nUnder    that     statute,    a    federal    employee    may    pursue   an   age\n\ndiscrimination claim by filing a charge of discrimination with the\n\nEEOC, and, after an appropriate interval, filing a civil action in\n\na federal district court.           See 29 U.S.C. § 633a(b), (c).         In the\n\nalternative, a federal employee may provide timely written notice\n\nto the EEOC of his intent to sue, wait for a stipulated interval\n\n(thirty days) to elapse, and then commence a civil action.                See id.\n\n§ 633a(d).\n\n            In this case, the appellant blithely proceeded to sue\n\nwithout either filing an administrative claim or giving the EEOC\n\nprior written notice of an intention to sue.              Compliance with this\n\nadministrative protocol is a precondition to suit in most cases —\n\nwe shall discuss an exception shortly, see infra note 4 — and such\n\ncompliance must occur before a federal court may entertain a suit\n\n\n\n     3\n      We need not dwell on the details of the alleged harassment\nbecause the facts recounted above dictate the result we must reach.\n\n                                        -4-\n\fthat seeks recovery for an alleged violation of the ADEA. Mercado-\n\nGarcia v. Ponce Fed. Bank, 979 F.2d 890, 895 (1st Cir. 1992);\n\nPowers v. Grinnell Corp., 915 F.2d 34, 37 (1st Cir. 1990).               At\n\nfirst blush, then, it appears that the district court appropriately\n\ndismissed the appellant's ADEA claim.\n\n            The appellant has two rejoinders.       First, he emphasizes\n\nthat the district court disposed of this claim on a motion to\n\ndismiss, and, citing cases such as Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534\n\nU.S. 506, 510-15 (2002), and Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47-48\n\n(1957), asseverates that his amended complaint should have been\n\nmore liberally construed. That asseveration misses the point. The\n\ndistrict court gave the appellant the benefit of the doubt by\n\naffording him an opportunity, through the show-cause order, to\n\ndemonstrate that he had satisfied the preconditions for bringing\n\nsuit on the ADEA claim.       The appellant was unable to make the\n\nrequisite showing.     Given that failure, the court was not obliged\n\nto allow the claim to linger.     See Cintrón-Lorenzo v. Departamento\n\nde Asuntos del Consumidor, 312 F.3d 522, 525-27 (1st Cir. 2002)\n\n(upholding dismissal of an ADA claim in similar circumstances).\n\n            Second, the appellant argues that the ADEA's procedural\n\nrequirements do not apply to his age discrimination claim. The fly\n\nin   the   ointment,   however,   is    that   he   offers   no   plausible\n\nexplanation as to why his claim should be exempted.               Given the\n\nappellant's unexcused failure to follow clearly stated procedural\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\frequirements, the district court had no choice but to dismiss his\n\nADEA claim.4     Cf. Bonilla v. Muebles J. J. Alvarez, Inc., 194 F.3d\n\n275, 277-79 (1st Cir. 1999) (affirming a dismissal, for similar\n\nreasons, of a claim brought under the Americans with Disabilities\n\nAct).\n\n              The appellant suggests that the amended complaint also\n\ncan be read as stating a claim under Title VII, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e\n\nto 2000e-17.      We see no adequate basis for this suggestion.              We\n\nadd, however, that even if the complaint is so read, the appellant\n\ngains    no   advantage.   Like    the    ADEA,   Title   VII   conditions    a\n\nplaintiff's      ability   to     sue    on   compliance        with   certain\n\nadministrative requirements.            See, e.g., id. § 2000e-5.         The\n\nappellant does not pretend to have satisfied those requirements.\n\n              We turn next to the appellant's constitutional claims.\n\nTo the extent that these claims are a mere restatement of his age\n\n\n     4\n      We say \"unexcused\" because these procedural requirements,\nwhile compulsory, are not jurisdictional. See Zipes v. Trans World\nAirlines, Inc., 455 U.S. 385, 393 (1982). The need for compliance\nis, therefore, \"subject to the usual gamut of equitable\nexceptions.\" Bonilla v. Muebles J. J. Alvarez, Inc., 194 F.3d 275,\n278 (1st Cir. 1999). But courts take a \"narrow view\" of equitable\nexceptions to such statutory requirements, Rys v. United States\nPostal Serv., 886 F.2d 443, 446 (1st Cir. 1989), and the appellant\nhas not suggested that any particular grounds exist for equitable\ntolling. Consequently, we deem any such argument foreclosed. See\nBonilla, 194 F.3d at 279 (sustaining dismissal of an ADA suit for\nfailure to comply with procedural notice requirements where the\nplaintiff \"d[id] not allege any facts that remotely suggest a\nplausible basis for [equitable] relief\"); United States v. Zannino,\n895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (concluding that issues adverted to\nin a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed\nargumentation, are deemed abandoned).\n\n                                    -6-\n\fdiscrimination claim, they are not justiciable.            The ADEA provides\n\nthe exclusive federal remedy for age discrimination in employment.\n\nSee Lafleur v. Tex. Dep't of Health, 126 F.3d 758, 760 (5th Cir.\n\n1997); Chennareddy v. Bowsher, 935 F.2d 315, 318 (D.C. Cir. 1991);\n\nZombro v. Baltimore City Police Dep't, 868 F.2d 1364, 1369 (4th\n\nCir. 1989).\n\n           The district court ended its analysis at this point. The\n\nappellant, however, suggests that his constitutional claims sweep\n\nmore broadly, extending beyond the realm of age discrimination. To\n\nthe extent (if at all) that this suggestion has a basis in the\n\nrecord, the appellant's constitutional claims are still foreclosed.\n\n           The   appellant   brings      these    claims     against      three\n\ndefendants — the United States, the United States Postal Service,\n\nand the Postmaster General (in his official capacity) — seeking\n\nmoney damages. The doctrine of sovereign immunity bars such claims\n\nagainst the United States.        FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, 475\n\n(1994); United States v. Horn, 29 F.3d 754, 761 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\nIndeed, in the absence of a specific statutory authorization (and\n\nthe appellant points to none), the only way in which a suit for\n\ndamages arising out of constitutional violations attributable to\n\nfederal action may be brought is under the doctrine of Bivens v.\n\nSix Unknown Agents of the FBN, 403 U.S. 388 (1971).            However, the\n\nremedy   provided   in   Bivens   does   not     breathe    life   into    the\n\n\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fappellant's otherwise moribund constitutional claims.                   We explain\n\nbriefly.\n\n           In Bivens, the Supreme Court allowed a suit for damages\n\nagainst federal officers in their individual capacities for alleged\n\nviolations of the plaintiff's constitutional rights.                   Id. at 389.\n\nBut the government's sovereign immunity does not vanish simply\n\nbecause    government    officials       may    be   personally        liable   for\n\nunconstitutional acts.       See Gonsalves v. IRS, 975 F.2d 13, 15 (1st\n\nCir. 1992); Am. Ass'n of Commodity Traders v. Dep't of Treasury,\n\n598 F.2d 1233, 1235 (1st Cir. 1979).           Accordingly, the appellant's\n\nclaims against the United States are a dead letter.\n\n             This   leaves   the   Postal      Service    and    the    Postmaster\n\nGeneral. Although the Postal Service does not enjoy the protection\n\nof complete sovereign immunity in the circumstances of this case,\n\nsee 39 U.S.C. §§ 401(1), 409(c), the Supreme Court has refused to\n\nrecognize a Bivens remedy against federal agencies (even those for\n\nwhich sovereign immunity has been broadly waived).                See Meyer, 510\n\nU.S. at 484-86. Hence, the appellant cannot rewardingly direct his\n\nconstitutional claims against the Postal Service.\n\n           By like token, the appellant does not have a viable\n\nBivens claim against the Postmaster General.                    He has sued the\n\nPostmaster    General   solely     in   the    latter's   official       capacity.\n\nBivens suits only can be brought against federal officers in their\n\nindividual capacities.       See Rivera v. Riley, 209 F.3d 24, 28 (1st\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fCir. 2000); Affiliated Prof'l Home Health Care Agency v. Shalala,\n\n164 F.3d 282, 286 (5th Cir. 1999); Buford v. Runyon, 160 F.3d 1199,\n\n1203 (8th Cir. 1998); Sanchez-Mariani v. Ellingwood, 691 F.2d 592,\n\n596 (1st Cir. 1982).      The absence of any \"individual capacity\"\n\ndefendant sounds the death knell for any purported Bivens claim.\n\n            We need go no further.5      For the reasons elucidated\n\nabove,   the   district   court   appropriately   dismissed   both   the\n\nappellant's statutory claim of age discrimination and his various\n\nconstitutional claims.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      Citing cases such as Schweiker v. Chilicky, 487 U.S. 412,\n425-29 (1988), and Bush v. Lucas, 462 U.S. 367, 389 (1983), the\nappellees argue that no direct constitutional claim for damages is\navailable due to the existence of a comprehensive statutory scheme\nfor the resolution of employment disputes involving postal workers.\nThere is substantial support in the case law for that view. See,\ne.g., Turner v. Holbrook, 278 F.3d 754, 757-58 (8th Cir. 2002);\nBennett v. Barnett, 210 F.3d 272, 274-76 (5th Cir. 2000); Pipkin v.\nUnited States Postal Serv., 951 F.2d 272, 275-76 (10th Cir. 1991).\nWe leave the preclusion question for another day, however, as this\nrecord contains more obvious grounds for affirmance of the decision\nbelow.\n\n                                   -9-\n\f",

The district court gave the appellant the benefit of the doubt by affording him an opportunity, through the show-cause order, to demonstrate that he had satisfied the preconditions for bringing suit on the ADEA claim. The appellant was unable to make the requisite showing. Given that failure, the court was not obliged to allow the claim to linger. <i>See Cintr&#243;n-Lorenzo v.

The appellant, however, suggests that his constitutional claims sweep more broadly, extending beyond the realm of age discrimination. To the extent (if at all) that this suggestion has a basis in the record, the appellant's constitutional claims are still foreclosed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant brings these claims against three defendants&#8212;the United States, the United States Postal Service, and the Postmaster General (in his official capacity)&#8212;seeking money damages. The doctrine of sovereign immunity bars such claims against the United States. <i>FDIC v. Meyer,</i> 510 U.S. 471, 475, 114 S.Ct. 996, 127 L.Ed.2d 308 (1994); <i>United States v. Horn,</i> 29 F.3d 754, 761 (1st Cir.1994). Indeed, in the absence of a specific statutory authorization (and the appellant points to none), the only way in which a suit for damages arising out of constitutional violations attributable to federal action may be brought is under the doctrine of <i>Bivens v. Six Unknown Agents of the FBN,</i> 403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). However, the remedy provided in <i>Bivens</i> does not breathe life into the appellant's otherwise moribund constitutional claims. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Bivens,</i> the Supreme Court allowed a suit for damages against federal officers in their individual capacities for alleged violations of the plaintiff's constitutional rights. <i>Id.</i> at 389, 91 S.Ct. 1999. But the government's sovereign immunity does not vanish simply because government officials may be personally liable for unconstitutional acts. <i>See Gonsalves v. IRS,</i> 975 F.2d 13, 15 (1st Cir.1992); <i>Am. Ass'n of Commodity Traders v. Dep't of Treasury,</i> 598 F.2d 1233, 1235 (1st Cir. 1979). Accordingly, the appellant's claims against the United States are a dead letter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves the Postal Service and the Postmaster General. Although the Postal Service does not enjoy the protection of complete sovereign immunity in the circumstances of this case, <i>see</i> 39 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 401(1), 409(c), the Supreme Court has refused to recognize a <i>Bivens</i> remedy against federal agencies (even those for which sovereign immunity has been broadly waived). <i>See Meyer,</i> 510 U.S. at 484-86, 114 S.Ct. 996. Hence, the appellant cannot rewardingly direct his constitutional claims against the Postal Service.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By like token, the appellant does not have a viable <i>Bivens</i> claim against the Postmaster General. He has sued the Postmaster General solely in the latter's official capacity. <i>Bivens</i> suits only can be brought against federal officers in their individual capacities. <i>See Rivera v. Riley,</i> 209 F.3d 24, 28 (1st Cir.2000); <i>Affiliated Prof'l Home Health Care Agency v. Shalala,</i> 164 F.3d 282, 286 (5th Cir.1999); <i>Buford v.

Trans World Airlines, Inc.,</i> 455 U.S. 385, 393, 102 S.Ct. 1127, 71 L.Ed.2d 234 (1982). The need for compliance is, therefore, \"subject to the usual gamut of equitable exceptions.\" <i>Bonilla v. Muebles J.J. Alvarez, Inc.,</i> 194 F.3d 275, 278 (1st Cir.1999). But courts take a \"narrow view\" of equitable exceptions to such statutory requirements, <i>Rys v. United States Postal Serv.,</i> 886 F.2d 443, 446 (1st Cir.1989), and the appellant has not suggested that any particular grounds exist for equitable tolling. Consequently, we deem any such argument foreclosed. <i>See Bonilla,</i> 194 F.3d at 279 (sustaining dismissal of an ADA suit for failure to comply with procedural notice requirements where the plaintiff \"d[id] not allege any facts that remotely suggest a plausible basis for [equitable] relief\"); <i>United States v.

In his amended complaint, the appellant alleges violations of the First and Fifth Amendments to the United States Constitution and several federal statutes, including the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 621-634. Pertinently, he claims that the Postal Service engaged in a pattern of discriminatory harassment toward him \"because of [his] age and his exercise of his freedom of speech right, and his refusal to retire.\" The appellees moved for brevis disposition, averring, inter alia, that the appellant had failed to comply with applicable administrative requirements prior to suing for age discrimination, and that his remaining claims were precluded for a variety of other reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted the motion in part. <i>Tapia Tapia v. Henderson,</i> Civ. No. 99-2408, slip op. (D.P.R. Apr. 25, 2001) (unpublished). Only two aspects of that decision are relevant to the issues on appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> First, the court dismissed the appellant's constitutional claims on the ground that the ADEA provides the exclusive remedy for age discrimination. <i>Id.</i> at 3. Second, the court ordered the appellant to show cause why his ADEA claim should not be dismissed for failure to comply with statutory preconditions to suit. <i>Id.</i> at 3-4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant did not respond to the show-cause order, and the court proceeded to dismiss the age discrimination claim. <i>Tapia Tapia v. Henderson,</i> No. 99-2408, slip op. (D.P.R. May 14, 2002) (unpublished). The appellant sought reconsideration, maintaining that he was not required to comply with the ADEA's preconditions to suit. The district court rejected this proposition, reaffirmed the order of dismissal, and directed the entry of final judgment. <i>Tapia Tapia v. Henderson,</i> No. 99-2408, slip op. (D.P.R. June 28, 2002) (unpublished). This timely appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relevant facts are largely undisputed. At all times material hereto, the appellant worked as a mechanic for the Postal Service. As such, he was represented by a local union, which had a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with the Postal Service. The CBA created a grievance/arbitration procedure through which employees within the bargaining unit (like the appellant) might seek redress for employment-related harms. Although the appellant had used this procedure in the past, he did not attempt to grieve the matters of which he complains in the instant action (the acts constituting the so-called pattern of discriminatory harassment). Moreover, he never provided the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) with prior notice of his intent to sue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, we address the appellant's specific assignments of error, looking first to his ADEA claim. Under that statute, a federal employee may pursue an age discrimination claim by filing a charge of discrimination with the EEOC, and, after an appropriate interval, filing a civil action in a federal district court. <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 633a(b), (c). In the alternative, a federal employee may provide timely written notice to the EEOC of his intent to sue, wait for a stipulated interval (thirty days) to elapse, and then commence a civil action. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 633a(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the appellant blithely proceeded to sue without either filing an administrative claim or giving the EEOC prior written notice of an intention to sue. Compliance with this administrative protocol is a precondition to suit in most cases&#8212; we shall discuss an exception shortly, <i>see infra</i> note 4&#8212;and such compliance must occur before a federal court may entertain a suit that seeks recovery for an alleged violation of the ADEA. <i>Mercado-Garcia v.

Six Unknown Agents of the FBN,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108375\"><a href=\"/opinion/108375/bivens-v-six-unknown-fed-narcotics-agents/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">388</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108375\"><a href=\"/opinion/108375/bivens-v-six-unknown-fed-narcotics-agents/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></a></span> (1971). However, the remedy provided in <i>Bivens</i> does not breathe life into the appellant's otherwise moribund constitutional claims. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Bivens,</i> the Supreme Court allowed a suit for damages against federal officers in their individual capacities for alleged violations of the plaintiff's constitutional rights. <i>Id.</i> at 389, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108375\"><a href=\"/opinion/108375/bivens-v-six-unknown-fed-narcotics-agents/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1999</span></a></span>. But the government's sovereign immunity does not vanish simply because government officials may be personally liable for unconstitutional acts. <i>See Gonsalves v. IRS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"590893\"><a href=\"/opinion/590893/gilbert-t-gonsalves-v-internal-revenue-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">975</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 15 (1st Cir.1992); <i>Am. Ass'n of Commodity Traders v. Dep't of Treasury,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"366384\"><a href=\"/opinion/366384/american-association-of-commodity-traders-v-department-of-the-treasury/\"><span class=\"volume\">598</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1233</span></a></span>, 1235 (1st Cir. 1979). Accordingly, the appellant's claims against the United States are a dead letter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves the Postal Service and the Postmaster General. Although the Postal Service does not enjoy the protection of complete sovereign immunity in the circumstances of this case, <i>see</i> 39 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 401(1), 409(c), the Supreme Court has refused to recognize a <i>Bivens</i> remedy against federal agencies (even those for which sovereign immunity has been broadly waived). <i>See Meyer,</i> 510 U.S. at 484-86, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112931\"><a href=\"/opinion/112931/fdic-v-meyer/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Hence, the appellant cannot rewardingly direct his constitutional claims against the Postal Service.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By like token, the appellant does not have a viable <i>Bivens</i> claim against the Postmaster General. He has sued the Postmaster General solely in the latter's official capacity. <i>Bivens</i> suits only can be brought against federal officers in their individual capacities. <i>See Rivera v. Riley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198879\"><a href=\"/opinion/198879/ruiz-rivera-v-dept-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 28 (1st Cir.2000); <i>Affiliated Prof'l Home Health Care Agency v.

But courts take a \"narrow view\" of equitable exceptions to such statutory requirements, <i>Rys v.

Consequently, we deem any such argument foreclosed. <i>See Bonilla,</i> 194 F.3d at 279 (sustaining dismissal of an ADA suit for failure to comply with procedural notice requirements where the plaintiff \"d[id] not allege any facts that remotely suggest a plausible basis for [equitable] relief\"); <i>United States v.
