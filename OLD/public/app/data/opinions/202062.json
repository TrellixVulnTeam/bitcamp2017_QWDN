Badway, Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Bureau,\nwith whom Thomas F. Reilly, Attorney General, was on brief, for\nappellees.\n\n\n\n                         February 15, 2006\n\f           LYNCH,   Circuit    Judge.     After   a     jury   trial   in   the\n\nMassachusetts Superior Court, Edward H. Lynch Jr. was convicted of\n\nfirst-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison.            He appealed,\n\nand the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) affirmed his\n\nconviction and affirmed the denial of various post-trial motions.\n\nSee Commonwealth v. Lynch, 789 N.E.2d 1052, 1062 (Mass. 2003),\n\ncert. denied, 540 U.S. 1059 (2003).\n\n           Lynch filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the\n\nfederal district court.        The court denied the petition on all\n\ngrounds.   Lynch then applied for a certificate of appealability\n\n(COA) as to the denial of the writ.       He sought and obtained the COA\n\nfor only one of the grounds in his habeas petition -- a due process\n\nclaim based on an argument that the state trial court's garbled\n\njury instructions effectively relieved the prosecution of the\n\nburden of proving malice beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n           We   review   the   petition   under   the    Antiterrorism      and\n\nEffective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), 28 U.S.C. ยง 2254.                      The\n\nrespondents have two arguments.           The first is that, under the\n\nparticulars of habeas law, Lynch cannot get to federal review of\n\nthe merits of the constitutional jury instruction issue unless he\n\nshows cause for and prejudice from the independent and adequate\n\nstate ground of procedural waiver based on his failure to object at\n\ntrial to the instructions.      Lynch, in turn, attempts to show cause\n\n\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fand   prejudice    to    excuse   his   procedural      default    by    asserting\n\nineffective assistance of trial counsel.\n\n           The respondents alternatively argue that if the merits\n\nare   reached,    then   the   standard       of   review   is   that    the   SJC's\n\nconclusions must be \"contrary to\" or an \"unreasonable application\"\n\nof federal constitutional law, and they are neither. Lynch replies\n\nthat the SJC did not address the federal constitutional question,\n\nand that on de novo review, he is entitled to relief.1                  This latter\n\ndispute raises a question of the closeness of the match between the\n\nSJC's \"center of gravity\" test and federal constitutional tests for\n\nevaluating error in jury instructions.              We never reach that issue.\n\n           We affirm the district court's denial of the habeas\n\npetition on the ground that Lynch has failed to show cause and\n\nprejudice to excuse his procedural default.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n       On the jury instruction issue, each party's brief applied\nthe standard of review more favorable to the other side, and then\neach party changed its mind at oral argument. Thus, in his brief,\nLynch suggested that the SJC had chosen not to review any federal\nconstitutional issue, but he framed his argument on the merits of\nthe jury instruction issue in terms of the AEDPA standard of\nreview. At oral argument, however, he said that the SJC did not\nactually address the federal constitutional question, and that our\nreview should be de novo. Meanwhile, respondents' brief states\nthat \"the SJC decided the jury instruction claim solely as a matter\nof state law. Thus, this court reviews the jury instruction claim\nde novo.\" However, at oral argument, respondents said the \"center\nof gravity test\" that the SJC applied to the jury instruction issue\nwas a loose way of stating the federal test and was not in conflict\nwith federal law, implicitly invoking AEDPA review.\n\n                                        -3-\n\f                                  I.\n\nA.        The Underlying State Crime\n\n          The facts are described as they were found by the SJC,\n\nsupplemented with other facts from the record that are consistent\n\nwith the SJC's findings.    We must \"accept the state court findings\n\nof fact unless [Lynch] convinces us, by clear and convincing\n\nevidence, that they are in error.\"     McCambridge v. Hall, 303 F.3d\n\n24, 26 (1st Cir. 2002) (en banc) (citing 28 U.S.C. ยง 2254(e)(1));\n\nsee also Smiley v. Maloney, 422 F.3d 17, 19 n.1 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nLynch recounts the facts somewhat differently to this court, but he\n\ndoes not argue that the SJC's description of what happened is in\n\nerror.2\n\n          In June 1992, Lynch lived and worked on a hog farm in\n\nLakeville, Massachusetts.     Early in the afternoon of June 5, he\n\nwent to Taunton and began drinking.    Within several hours, he had\n\nconsumed twelve to fourteen bottles of beer.    At around 7:00 p.m.,\n\nhe moved to another bar, where he drank more beer, leaving only\n\nonce at around 9:30 p.m.; he bought a pint of vodka and returned\n\nwith it within ten minutes.     When that bar closed at 1:00 a.m.,\n\n\n\n     2\n       Lynch's version of the facts emphasizes his testimony that\nit was the victim who had attacked him, lunging with the knife and\nkneeing him in the groin, and that he had been trying to fend her\noff when he noticed she had been stabbed. But he also acknowledges\nthe prosecution's evidence that the victim sustained seven stab\nwounds and that Lynch confessed to stabbing the victim, and he\nagrees that the \"evidence would have supported a finding of . . .\nmalice.\"\n\n                                 -4-\n\fLynch remained \"huddled in a doorway,\" continuing to drink from his\n\nbottle of vodka and napping.    At 6:00 a.m., he had breakfast at a\n\nluncheonette, and then he returned to the second bar, where he\n\nresumed drinking.    By 2:00 p.m., when he left the bar, Lynch had\n\nconsumed approximately fourteen more alcoholic drinks.\n\n            Lynch left the bar in the company of Andrea Geremia, who\n\nhad agreed to have sex with him for money.    The two took a taxicab\n\nto Lynch's cottage on the grounds of the hog farm.     Lynch had two\n\nbeers, and Geremia had a soft drink.       Lynch gave Geremia fifty\n\ndollars, and they went to the bedroom, where Lynch passed out\n\nbefore a sexual act was completed.     Lynch awoke when he heard \"the\n\nsound of a squeaky dresser drawer being opened.\" He concluded that\n\nGeremia, who was walking away from the drawer and who had her hand\n\ndown her shirt, had stolen money from him.       He became angry and\n\nfollowed Geremia to the kitchen.   She turned on him, holding a ten-\n\ninch boning knife. Lynch \"easily overpowered\" her; he is six feet,\n\ntwo inches tall and then weighed 180 pounds, and she was \"much\n\nsmaller.\"    Lynch grabbed the knife from Geremia and stabbed her.\n\nAccording to a forensic pathologist, Geremia had been stabbed five\n\ntimes in the chest and abdomen, each time receiving a wound that by\n\nitself would have been fatal.    She had also been wounded twice on\n\nher back and side.    Lynch watched her bleed to death.     The next\n\nday, he buried her body in a trench on the farm used for disposing\n\nof dead pigs.\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f           Lynch was incarcerated on unrelated charges and confided\n\nin   another   inmate,   who   told    another;     the   police   eventually\n\ninterviewed    Lynch's    confidant.        Using   the   information   they\n\nobtained, the police discovered Geremia's body on January 4, 1993.\n\nB.         Trial in the Massachusetts Superior Court\n\n           Lynch was charged with murder in the first degree.\n\nLynch's defense at trial was that he had stabbed Geremia in self-\n\ndefense or by accident, and that his \"sense of reality was altered\"\n\nat the time of the stabbing because of his heavy drinking.                He\n\ntestified he did not intentionally stab Geremia; the stabbing was\n\ninadvertent and happened during a struggle in which Geremia tried\n\nto stab him with the knife, kneed him in the groin, and slapped\n\nhim.   Lynch and his trial counsel reenacted the struggle for the\n\njury (Lynch as himself, counsel as Geremia).          Lynch testified that\n\nwhen he realized Geremia had been stabbed, he tried to stop her\n\nbleeding by pressing a towel onto the stab wound.           The defense also\n\npresented evidence of Lynch's heavy consumption of alcohol earlier\n\nand expert testimony about the effects of alcohol addiction and\n\nexcessive drinking.      The expert opined that when Lynch awoke from\n\nhis passed-out state, he would have felt numb and could have been\n\nin a \"blackout\" or \"hallucinating\" when Geremia was stabbed.\n\n           Defense counsel's closing argument focused on Lynch's\n\nextreme intoxication and lack of sleep -- as counsel put it, \"[h]e\n\ndrank and he drank and he drank\" before going home with Geremia,\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fand then he drank some more.                 Counsel argued that Geremia had\n\nviolated     Lynch's     rights   and       the   sanctity    of   Lynch's    home   by\n\nstealing money from the dresser, but this was presented not as\n\njustification for an attack on Geremia, but rather as the precursor\n\nto Lynch's simply asking Geremia to leave.                    Counsel stressed not\n\nrage, but the notion that Lynch \"didn't know what [Geremia] was\n\ncapable of\" once Geremia \"pull[ed] a knife.\"                  Lynch reacted as any\n\nreasonable person would: he tried to get the knife out of Geremia's\n\nhand, whereupon she \"took a swipe at his hand,\" and a struggle\n\nensued, in which Geremia continued to kick and hit Lynch, until at\n\nsome point Lynch noticed some blood.               Lynch then \"panicked,\" tried\n\nto    stop   the   bleeding    with     a    towel,     and   ultimately     concealed\n\nGeremia's body on the grounds of the hog farm.\n\n             Counsel     suggested      that      the   supposed    \"multiple    stab\n\nwounds\" had actually occurred later on, when Geremia's body was\n\nbeing recovered. Counsel portrayed Lynch as \"scared\" and concluded\n\nthat the killing \"was self-defense, and it was an accident,\" that\n\n\"[a]t the very worst . . . it was recklessness,\" and that there\n\n\"certainly wasn't malice.\"\n\n             At the heart of Lynch's habeas argument are the jury\n\ninstructions distinguishing murder from voluntary manslaughter. At\n\nthe    beginning    of   the   jury     charge,     the    trial   judge     correctly\n\ninstructed the jury that \"[a]ll of my instructions are equally\n\nimportant.     Do not single out some and ignore others.\"                    The court\n\n\n                                            -7-\n\falso stated that \"[w]e can't decide that one law is a good law and\n\nanother is a bad law . . . .         You must accept the entire law that\n\nI'm going to give you.\"\n\n           When    it   came   to   the    substantive   law   governing   the\n\ncharges, the court started with murder: \"Murder is the unlawful\n\nkilling   of   a   human   being    with    malice   aforethought.    Murder\n\ncommitted with deliberately premeditated malice aforethought or\n\nwith extreme atrocity or cruelty is murder in the first degree.\n\nMurder which does not appear to be murder in the first degree is\n\nmurder in the second degree.\"\n\n           On malice itself and on voluntary manslaughter, the court\n\nsaid:\n\n           [T]he crime is voluntary manslaughter, not\n           murder, if malice is negated by reasonable\n           sudden provocation or sudden combat or at\n           least by a reasonable doubt whether those\n           circumstances were absent.     I will . . .\n           instruct you on voluntary manslaughter in a\n           few minutes.\n                The existence of malice has not been\n           proved if you find the death resulted when the\n           defendant was in the state of hot blood upon a\n           reasonable provocation or sudden combat or in\n           the   exercise   of    self-defense,   however\n           excessive you find the use of force to have\n           been in the circumstances.\n\n           The court told the jury not to draw an inference of\n\nmalice \"unless you are persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that the\n\ndefendant's specific intent did not arise in his mind when he was\n\nin a state of hot blood upon a reasonable provocation or sudden\n\ncombat or in the exercise of self-defense.\"\n\n                                      -8-\n\f          After explaining first- and second-degree murder, and\n\nstating multiple times that to prove murder the Commonwealth had to\n\nprove beyond a reasonable doubt malice and other elements, the\n\ncourt explained that if the Commonwealth had not proved murder, the\n\njury \"must then consider whether the Commonwealth has proved the\n\nlesser included offense of manslaughter.\"       The court defined\n\nmanslaughter as \"the unlawful killing of a person by another\n\nwithout malice aforethought.\"   The court explained that certain\n\nmitigating circumstances negate malice, and if they are present,\n\n\"even though the defendant has committed an unlawful killing the\n\ncrime is manslaughter and not murder.\"    The court said that one\n\ntype of manslaughter is voluntary manslaughter, which it defined as\n\n          an unlawful intentional killing resulting from\n          a sudden transport of the passions of fear,\n          anger, fright, nervous excitement or heat of\n          blood, when there is no time to deliberate and\n          when such passion or heat of blood is produced\n          by adequate or reasonable provocation and\n          without malice, or upon sudden combat.\n\n          Next, the court gave the instructions about which Lynch\n\ncomplains: \"In order to prove the defendant guilty of voluntary\n\nmanslaughter the Commonwealth must prove three elements beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt: first, that the defendant inflicted an injury\n\nupon Andrea Geremia from which she died; second, that the defendant\n\ninjured Andrea Geremia as a result of a sudden combat or in the\n\nheat of passion or using excessive force in self-defense; and\n\nthird, that the homicide was committed unlawfully, without legal\n\n\n                                -9-\n\fexcuse or justification, and was not an accident.\" (emphases added)\n\nWe highlight the portion of the court's language -- what Lynch\n\ncalls an \"inversion\" -- that puts the burden on the Commonwealth to\n\nprove the mitigating factors that negate malice.\n\n           Right after this, the court confusingly stated that the\n\nburden   was    on   the   Commonwealth       to   disprove   these     mitigating\n\nfactors: \"Where there is evidence of provocation the Commonwealth\n\nhas the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the\n\ndefendant did not act in the heat of passion.\"                 The court added\n\nthat   \"[t]he   Commonwealth     has    the    burden   of    proving    beyond   a\n\nreasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in the heat of\n\npassion or on sudden provocation.         You may not return a verdict of\n\nguilty of murder unless the Commonwealth meets this burden.\"                 This\n\nwas followed by another \"inversion,\" described in the footnote\n\n\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\fbelow.3          Indeed, Lynch claims that in all,     there were seven\n\ninversions.\n\n                 The jury returned a verdict of guilty of first-degree\n\nmurder.          The jury found that Lynch had committed first-degree\n\nmurder both \"with deliberately premeditated malice aforethought\"\n\nand \"with extreme atrocity or cruelty.\"        The court sentenced Lynch\n\nto life imprisonment.         His post-trial motions for a new trial and\n\nother requests were denied.\n\nC.               The SJC Ruling on Lynch's Direct Appeal and Appeal From\n                 Denial of Post-Trial Motions\n\n                 Lynch appealed his conviction and from the denial of\n\nvarious post-trial motions, including a motion for a new trial.\n\nThe appeals were consolidated before the SJC.             See Lynch, 789\n\nN.E.2d at 1054.        One of the claims Lynch raised before the SJC was\n\nthat       the     trial   judge's   \"instruction   regarding     voluntary\n\n\n\n       3\n           The court told the jury that\n\n                 if, after considering all of the evidence, you\n                 find that the Commonwealth has proved beyond a\n                 reasonable   doubt  that   the   circumstances\n                 preceding or attending the killing were caused\n                 by adequate and reasonable provocation by the\n                 deceased or by an act of sudden combat against\n                 the defendant . . . and that thereupon the\n                 defendant under the influence of such passion\n                 and before the cooling of the blood killed the\n                 deceased, then you must find the defendant\n                 guilty of voluntary manslaughter.\n\nBut \"[i]f . . . you find the Commonwealth has not met this burden\nof proof then you must find the defendant not guilty of voluntary\nmanslaughter.\"\n\n                                     -11-\n\fmanslaughter      impermissibly   shifted      the   burden   of   proof      on\n\nprovocation,   thereby    creating      a   substantial   likelihood     of   a\n\nmiscarriage of justice.\"4     Id.      The SJC agreed that there had been\n\nerror,5 but observed that there had been no objection to it, and so\n\nthe error was subject only to limited review.             See id. at 1060.\n\nNoting the trial judge's other, correct, statements of the law and\n\nanalogizing to Commonwealth v. Fickling, 746 N.E.2d 745 (Mass.\n\n2001), the SJC held that \"the 'center of gravity' of the charge\n\nplainly rested on the side of the correct instruction,\" and that\n\nthere was thus not \"a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of\n\njustice.\"    Lynch, 789 N.E.2d at 1061.              The SJC also rejected\n\nLynch's other claims, including a separate claim for ineffective\n\nassistance   of    counsel   as   to    matters   unrelated   to   the     jury\n\n\n     4\n       This issue was raised solely on direct appeal, and not in\nLynch's motion for a new trial. Lynch cast his claim on appeal as\none of both federal constitutional (due process) law and\nMassachusetts law, and he asserted that trial counsel's failure to\nobject \"amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel.\"\n     5\n       The SJC referred to the error as an \"Acevedo error,\" Lynch,\n789 N.E.2d at 1060, so named after the case of Commonwealth v.\nAcevedo, 695 N.E.2d 1065 (Mass. 1998). In Acevedo, the judge told\nthe jury that in order for a voluntary manslaughter conviction to\nbe warranted, the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat, inter alia, \"the defendant injured [the victim] as a result\nof sudden combat or in the heat of passion or using excessive force\nin self defense.\"    Id. at 1067.     The SJC stated that \"[t]hat\nlanguage incorrectly told the jury that malice is negated by\nprovocation only if provocation is proved beyond a reasonable\ndoubt,\" and it stressed that \"[t]he correct rule is that, where the\nevidence raises the possibility that the defendant may have acted\non reasonable provocation, the Commonwealth must prove, and the\njury must find, beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did\nnot act on reasonable provocation.\" Id.\n\n                                    -12-\n\finstructions, and affirmed the trial court in all respects.           See\n\nid. at 1054, 1062.\n\nD.         Federal Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus\n\n           Lynch then filed a petition in the U.S. District Court\n\nfor a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. ยง 2254,6 asserting four\n\nclaims,7 of which only the first is of concern.         The first was that\n\n\"the state court violated federal due process by allowing the\n\nmurder conviction even though several renditions of irreconcilable\n\ninstructions regarding factors negating malice effectively relieved\n\nthe   Commonwealth   of   the   burden   of   proving   malice   beyond   a\n\nreasonable doubt.\"    The substance of Lynch's argument is repeated\n\nin substantially the same form on appeal.\n\n           The district court denied the habeas petition.             The\n\ncourt, citing Ortiz v. DuBois, 19 F.3d 708 (1st Cir. 1994),\n\ncorrectly held that Lynch's failure to raise his objection to the\n\njury instructions at trial constituted an independent and adequate\n\nstate ground that was sufficient to foreclose federal habeas review\n\n\n\n      6\n       Before filing his habeas petition, Lynch had filed a\npetition for rehearing with the SJC, which was denied, and had\nfiled a petition for a writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court,\nwhich was also denied, see Lynch, 540 U.S. 1059.\n      7\n       Lynch's second, third, and fourth grounds were claims that\nLynch was deprived of effective assistance of counsel with respect\nto various pre-trial and trial matters; these were treated by the\ndistrict court as one basic ineffective assistance of counsel\nground.    Lynch's habeas petition did not make a specific\nineffective assistance of counsel argument as to trial counsel's\nfailure to object to the jury instructions.\n\n                                  -13-\n\fof the alleged error, absent a showing of cause and prejudice.                See\n\nid. at 714 (citing Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, 84 (1977)).\n\nThe court correctly noted that Lynch could only avoid the effect of\n\nthe procedural default by showing cause for and prejudice from his\n\nfailure to object.    See id. (citing Wainwright, 433 U.S. at 84).\n\nThe   court   determined   that      because     Lynch   had    only    offered\n\nspeculation that the jury relied on the incorrect instructions, he\n\nhad not met the required prejudice showing that the error put him\n\nat an actual and substantial disadvantage and infected his entire\n\ntrial with error of constitutional dimensions.            See id.      The court\n\ndenied ground one of Lynch's petition.           It also denied the claims\n\nof ineffective assistance of counsel as to other decisions on trial\n\ncounsel's part.\n\n          Lynch   sought   a   COA    as    to   the   first   ground    of   his\n\npetition, the due process/jury instruction issue.                The district\n\ncourt stated that there was room for disagreement on whether Lynch\n\nhad shown cause for and prejudice from his failure to object to the\n\ninstruction, and it allowed the COA \"as to the due process ground.\"\n\nE.        Lynch's Due Process Claim\n\n          The SJC determined that at least a portion of the jury\n\ncharge did contain error, and respondents do not challenge that\n\ndetermination here.    The ultimate dispute on the merits is about\n\nthe consequences of the error.        The SJC held that \"the 'center of\n\ngravity' of the charge plainly rested on the side of the correct\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\finstruction,\" and that there was thus not \"a substantial likelihood\n\nof a miscarriage of justice.\"       Lynch, 789 N.E.2d at 1061.     Lynch,\n\nhowever,   says   that   the   instructions   \"created   the   significant\n\npossibility that [he] was erroneously convicted of murder in the\n\nfirst degree instead of manslaughter.\"         Commonwealth v. Boucher,\n\n532 N.E.2d 37, 40 (Mass. 1989).\n\n           Lynch's federal constitutional argument is that the jury\n\ninstructions violated due process by effectively relieving the\n\nCommonwealth of the burden of proving malice, an essential element\n\nof the crime of murder.        Lynch invokes the rule of In re Winship,\n\n397 U.S. 358 (1970), that \"the Due Process Clause protects the\n\naccused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he\n\nis charged.\"      Id. at 364; see also Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U.S.\n\n684, 704 (1975) (\"[T]he Due Process Clause requires the prosecution\n\nto prove beyond a reasonable doubt the absence of the heat of\n\npassion on sudden provocation when the issue is properly presented\n\nin a homicide case.\").\n\n                                     II.\n\nA.         Standard of Review\n\n           We review the district court's denial of habeas relief de\n\nnovo.   See Ellsworth v. Warden, 333 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n           The standards for review of the federal claim itself are\n\nset forth in the AEDPA: if the claim was \"adjudicated on the merits\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\fin   State    court   proceedings,\"    the   AEDPA   mandates   that   the\n\napplication for habeas corpus is not to be granted with respect to\n\nthat claim unless the state court's adjudication of the claim\n\nsatisfies either of two conditions: (1) it \"resulted in a decision\n\nthat was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,\n\nclearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court\n\nof the United States,\"8 or (2) it \"resulted in a decision that was\n\nbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the\n\nevidence presented in the State court proceeding.\"              28 U.S.C.\n\nยง 2254(d).\n\n             There are several important caveats for purposes of this\n\ncase.    The first is that if the state court finds a claim was\n\nprocedurally defaulted at trial, we cannot reach the merits of that\n\nclaim unless the petitioner meets the federal habeas standards to\n\nexcuse the procedural waiver.         The second is that the petitioner\n\nmust have properly presented the claim to the state court under the\n\nexhaustion requirement of ยง 2254(b)(1).        And the third is that if\n\nthe habeas petition \"presents a federal claim that was raised\n\nbefore the state court but was left unresolved,\" this court reviews\n\nthe claim de novo.      Horton v. Allen, 370 F.3d 75, 80 (1st Cir.\n\n\n\n     8\n       Further explication of the \"contrary to\" prong may be found\nin Ouber v. Guarino, 293 F.3d 19 (1st Cir. 2002). See id. at 26;\nsee also Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 412-13 (2000).\nExplication of the \"unreasonable application\" test may be found in\nMcCambridge, 303 F.3d 24. See id. at 36; see also Williams, 529\nU.S. at 412-13.\n\n                                  -16-\n\f2004).     After all, \"AEDPA imposes a requirement of deference to\n\nstate court decisions, but we can hardly defer to the state court\n\non an issue that the state court did not address.\"                       Fortini v.\n\nMurphy, 257 F.3d 39, 47 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\nB.          Procedural Default\n\n            The respondents argue that this court should not review\n\nthe merits of Lynch's due process claim, because he procedurally\n\ndefaulted his challenge to the jury instructions and has not shown\n\ncircumstances to excuse the default.\n\n            In contrast to the statutory exhaustion requirement, the\n\nprocedural       default   doctrine       stems       from   equitable   principles\n\ninformed    by    history,    statutes,         and    judicial   decisions.    See\n\nMcCleskey    v.    Zant,     499   U.S.    467,       489-90   (1991)    (discussing\n\nsimilarities of doctrines of procedural default and \"abuse of the\n\nwrit\");    Wainwright,     433     U.S.    at    81.     The   procedural   default\n\ndoctrine consists largely of judge-made rules.                      See Dretke v.\n\nHaley, 541 U.S. 386, 394 (2004).\n\n            Respondents' procedural default argument invokes the rule\n\nthat\n\n            [i]n all cases in which a state prisoner has\n            defaulted his federal claims in state court\n            pursuant to an independent and adequate state\n            procedural rule, federal habeas review of the\n            claims is barred unless the prisoner can\n            demonstrate cause for the default and actual\n            prejudice as a result of the alleged violation\n            of federal law, or demonstrate that failure to\n            consider   the  claims   will   result  in   a\n            fundamental miscarriage of justice.\n\n                                          -17-\n\fColeman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 750 (1991); see also id. at 729-\n\n30 (discussing \"independent and adequate state ground doctrine,\"\n\nwhich \"applies to bar federal habeas when a state court declined to\n\naddress a prisoner's federal claims because the prisoner had failed\n\nto meet a state procedural requirement\" (citing Wainwright, 433\n\nU.S. at 81, 87)).\n\n            \"A state court's decision to find a forfeiture, based on\n\nthe defendant's failure to object at trial, is an independent and\n\nadequate    ground    for    decision   so   long   as   the   state      court\n\nconsistently applies its contemporaneous objection rule and has not\n\nwaived it in the particular case by basing the decision on some\n\nother ground.\"       Horton, 370 F.3d at 80-81; see also id. at 81\n\n(noting    that   \"[t]he    SJC   consistently   enforces   the    rule   that\n\nunpreserved claims are forfeited and enforced the rule in the\n\ninstant case\" (citations omitted)).\n\n            The SJC, expressly noting that the instruction \"was not\n\nobjected to at trial,\" reviewed Lynch's jury instructions claim for\n\n\"a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.\" Lynch, 789\n\nN.E.2d at 1060.       Limited review of this sort \"does not work a\n\nwaiver of the contemporaneous objection requirement.\"             Horton, 370\n\nF.3d at 81.\n\n            Because there is an adequate and independent state ground\n\nfor the SJC's decision, Lynch's claim on the merits of the jury\n\ninstruction issue can only be considered for habeas purposes if\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\fLynch meets one of the established exceptions to the bar on federal\n\nhabeas consideration of his claim.       There can be no serious claim\n\nthat this petition falls into the \"fundamental miscarriage of\n\njustice\" category, see Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750, (assuming the\n\nexception applies in at least certain non-capital cases): Lynch\n\ndoes not argue that he is \"actually innocent\" of the underlying\n\noffense, and since Massachusetts does not have the death penalty,\n\nthe question of actual innocence of the \"aggravating circumstances\n\nrendering the inmate eligible for the death penalty,\" Dretke, 541\n\nU.S. at 388, does not arise.9    The alternative that remains open to\n\nLynch is that he must establish \"cause and prejudice\" with respect\n\nto the procedural default.      See Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750.\n\n          Here, the district court denied Lynch's habeas petition\n\non the ground that Lynch failed to object at trial and had failed\n\nto show prejudice, so that an independent and adequate state ground\n\nbarred federal habeas review of the due process claim.      We prefer\n\nto analyze the case initially on cause grounds.\n\n          To establish cause, there must be \"some objective factor\n\nexternal to the defense\" which \"impeded counsel's efforts to comply\n\n\n\n     9\n       Massachusetts sometimes uses the phrase \"capital case\" to\nrefer to murder cases, even where the sentence imposed is not a\nsentence of death. See, e.g., Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 278, ยง 33E (for\npurposes of review under ยง33E, \"a capital case shall mean a case in\nwhich the defendant was tried on an indictment for murder in the\nfirst degree and was convicted of murder in the first degree\");\nCommonwealth v. Anderson, 834 N.E.2d 1159, 1172 (Mass. 2005).\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\fwith the State's procedural rule.\"                  Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S.\n\n478, 488 (1986).             In some instances, state defense counsel's\n\nineffectiveness at trial in failing to preserve a claim for review\n\nin state court will suffice to establish such cause.                      See id. at\n\n487-88.       But that ineffectiveness must rise to the level of being\n\na constitutional violation under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S.\n\n668 (1984).         See Gunter v. Maloney, 291 F.3d 74, 81, 82 n.2 (1st\n\nCir.   2002).         A   habeas    petitioner      complaining      of   ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel as a basis to show cause for procedural\n\ndefault must show (1) \"that counsel's representation fell below an\n\nobjective standard of reasonableness,\" Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688,\n\nand (2) that \"any deficiencies in counsel's performance [were]\n\nprejudicial to the defense,\" id. at 692, in that \"there is a\n\nreasonable      probability        that,   but    for    counsel's   unprofessional\n\nerrors, the result of the proceeding would have been different,\"\n\nid. at 694.\n\n              The     Supreme      Court   has     recently   elaborated     on   the\n\nStrickland prejudice prong.                In a case where counsel failed to\n\npresent mitigating evidence at sentencing, the Court first employed\n\nan articulation close to the Strickland language, finding that \"had\n\nthe    jury    been       confronted    with      this   considerable     mitigating\n\nevidence, there is a reasonable probability that it would have\n\nreturned with a different sentence.\"                 Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S.\n\n510, 536 (2003).           The Court went on to conclude that \"[h]ad the\n\n\n                                           -20-\n\fjury been able to place petitioner's excruciating life history on\n\nthe mitigating side of the scale, there is a reasonable probability\n\nthat at least one juror would have struck a different balance,\" id.\n\nat 537, and that \"the available mitigating evidence, taken as a\n\nwhole, might well have influenced the jury's appraisal of [the\n\nhabeas petitioner's] moral culpability,\" id. at 538 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted) (quoting Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362,\n\n398 (2000)).\n\n               Importantly, a federal habeas petitioner trying to excuse\n\nhis procedural default by showing ineffective assistance of counsel\n\nas cause must first have presented the ineffective assistance claim\n\nto the state court.      See Edwards v. Carpenter, 529 U.S. 446, 452-53\n\n(2000); Gunter, 291 F.3d at 81.              The Supreme Court has stressed\n\n\"the     inseparability          of   the     exhaustion       rule     and    the\n\nprocedural-default doctrine.\" Carpenter, 529 U.S. at 452. And so,\n\na habeas petitioner can default on presenting an ineffective\n\nassistance claim even when the claim is offered as a reason to show\n\ncause and prejudice for his default on a different constitutional\n\nclaim.    Of course, he can try to show cause and prejudice to excuse\n\nthe default of the ineffective assistance claim in order to show\n\ncause    and    prejudice   to    excuse    his   procedural   default    of   the\n\ndifferent constitutional claim he wants to present.                   Id. at 453.\n\nLynch does not present such an argument: he says he did present to\n\n\n\n\n                                       -21-\n\fthe SJC an ineffective assistance claim on the failure to object to\n\nthe jury instructions.\n\n          On the question of cause, the respondents make two\n\narguments which put stumbling blocks10 in the way.   The respondents\n\nargue first that Lynch procedurally defaulted on his claim of\n\nineffective assistance of counsel as to the jury instructions.\n\nRespondents made this procedural default claim for the first time\n\nat oral argument, and their precise argument is unclear.       They\n\ntwice asserted that Lynch's ineffective assistance of counsel claim\n\non the jury instructions issue \"was never brought up.\"     But they\n\nalso stated that Lynch did assert ineffective assistance on the\n\njury instructions before the SJC, and that the problem occurred in\n\nthe trial court, where Lynch failed to include in his motion for a\n\nnew trial a specific claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as\n\n\n     10\n       It is customary to address the procedural default issue on\nhabeas first, even if that issue may be more complex than simply\nturning to the ultimate question, and even when the likely\naffirmance on the ultimate question is to uphold the state court\njudgment.   See Lambrix v. Singletary, 520 U.S. 518, 525 (1997)\n(noting that the procedural bar issue ordinarily should be resolved\nfirst); see also Dretke, 541 U.S. at 393-94 (holding that \"a\nfederal court faced with allegations of actual innocence, whether\nof the sentence or of the crime charged, must first address all\nnondefaulted claims for comparable relief and other grounds for\ncause to excuse the procedural default\"). The procedural default\nrule is logically prior and arguably it is more respectful to the\nstate to treat the default rule first. See Lambrix, 520 U.S. at\n523 (\"Application of the 'independent and adequate state ground'\ndoctrine to federal habeas review is based upon equitable\nconsiderations of federalism and comity.\").            Still, the\nconventional order of analysis, which we follow here, because\nrespondents have urged us to, itself can add a layer of complexity\nand delay.\n\n                               -22-\n\fto the jury instructions.           If it were clear that Lynch did not\n\ninclude in his ineffective assistance claim to the SJC the failure\n\nto object to the jury instructions, his case would be over.\n\n            Respondents' second argument, and the one advanced in\n\ntheir brief, is that if such an ineffective assistance claim were\n\npresented, the SJC effectively disposed of it on the prejudice\n\nprong when it held that there was not \"a substantial likelihood of\n\na miscarriage of justice.\"          Lynch, 789 N.E.2d at 1061.       We accept\n\nneither argument.\n\n            On the first argument, it is clear from the record that\n\nLynch did flatly raise before the SJC an ineffective assistance\n\nclaim     based   on    counsel's    failure     to    object   to   the   jury\n\ninstructions,     and   it   is   clear   that   the   Commonwealth    replied\n\ndirectly to this argument.11           The fact that the SJC failed to\n\ndiscuss this ineffective assistance claim does not mean Lynch did\n\nnot raise it.     To the extent respondents say the default occurred\n\nearlier, in Lynch's motion for a new trial, this point was not\n\nraised in the Commonwealth's brief to the SJC, and the SJC did not\n\n\n     11\n       Lynch's brief to the SJC, in concluding the discussion of\nthe jury instructions, stated: \"Because the correct formula was\nstated in [an SJC decision] in 1989, six years before the trial\nhere, an ordinary fallible lawyer should have objected and\ncorrected the judge.      This failure amounted to ineffective\nassistance of counsel, and created a substantial likelihood of\nmiscarriage of justice.\"     This was followed by a citation to\nLynch's addendum, which contained statements of the law on\nineffective assistance. The Commonwealth's brief to the SJC argued\nthat there was no ineffective assistance of counsel as to the jury\ninstructions, and Lynch's reply brief again argued that there was.\n\n                                      -23-\n\fsay the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as to the jury\n\ninstructions was foreclosed because of failure to comply with state\n\nprocedural rules.12\n\n            The second argument raises the question of whether the\n\nSJC, in applying the state rule for unobjected-to jury instructions\n\nand in concluding that there was no \"substantial likelihood of a\n\nmiscarriage of justice,\" essentially used the same test as that\n\nunder Strickland's prejudice prong.\n\n            We reject the second argument for two reasons.               First,\n\nthe SJC did not purport to do an ineffective assistance analysis on\n\nthis    point,   and   second,    the    two    standards    (for   review    of\n\nunpreserved error and for prejudice under Strickland) have not been\n\nshown by respondents to be the same.                We reject respondents'\n\nimplicit, unelaborated argument that the Strickland prejudice prong\n\nis no more than a miscarriage of justice test.                 The SJC neither\n\novertly nor implicitly adjudicated the jury instructions issue as\n\nan ineffective assistance claim.\n\n            In Mello v. Dipaulo, 295 F.3d 137 (1st Cir. 2002), we\n\nconsidered on habeas an unobjected-to jury instruction error and\n\nevaluated   whether    there     was    \"a    probability[,]     sufficient   to\n\nundermine    confidence    in    the    outcome,\"    id.    at   142   (quoting\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 688), that the instruction error \"could\n\n\n       12\n       At oral argument, respondents framed the issue only as one\nof procedural default and did not invoke the exhaustion requirement\nof ยง 2254(b)(1).\n\n                                       -24-\n\f. . . have affected the verdict the jury returned,\" id. at 149.\n\nThis is the Strickland prejudice standard.               See Rompilla v. Beard,\n\n125 S. Ct. 2456, 2469 (2005); Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 538.\n\n            In fact, the SJC's standard for ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel, articulated in Commonwealth v. Saferian, 315 N.E.2d 878,\n\n883 (Mass. 1974), is the functional equivalent of the Strickland\n\nstandard.    See Mello, 295 F.3d at 143-44; Scarpa v. DuBois, 38 F.3d\n\n1, 7 (1st Cir. 1994).     The Saferian standard is \"whether there has\n\nbeen serious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention of counsel\n\n-- behavior of counsel falling measurably below that which might be\n\nexpected from an ordinary fallible lawyer -- and, if that is found,\n\nthen, typically, whether it has likely deprived the defendant of an\n\notherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\" Saferian, 315\n\nN.E.2d at 883.\n\n            The standard the SJC did apply in its analysis of the\n\njury instructions issue was the \"substantial likelihood of a\n\nmiscarriage    of   justice\"    test.         But   it   did   not    connect    its\n\ndetermination    that   there    was    no    substantial      likelihood       of    a\n\nmiscarriage of justice to a finding on ineffective assistance as to\n\nthe jury instructions.\n\n            As a pure matter of language, the prejudice prong of\n\nStrickland    appears    to    impose    a     standard    more      favorable       to\n\ndefendants than a \"substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of\n\njustice\" test.      Under Strickland, Lynch must show only that \"there\n\n\n                                       -25-\n\fis a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional\n\nerrors, the result of the proceeding would have been different,\"\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 694, as illustrated in Wiggins.                                  See\n\nWiggins,   539       U.S.    at    536-38      (2003)      (emphasizing     \"reasonable\n\nprobability that at least one juror would have struck a different\n\nbalance\").   It may or may not be that the state courts have put a\n\njudicial gloss on their substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of\n\njustice standard, but the respondents have not provided argument or\n\ncitation on this point, and, absent that, we are not prepared to\n\nsay the state standard is the same as or more favorable than the\n\nStrickland prejudice standard.\n\n           Because          the    SJC    did        not   address   the    ineffective\n\nassistance   issue          as    to    the    failure     to    object    to    the   jury\n\ninstructions, we review it de novo.                    Fortini, 257 F.3d at 47.\n\n           As    a    matter       of    our   independent       review,    we    find   no\n\nStrickland   error      in       counsel's      failure     to   object    to    the   jury\n\ninstructions.        The premise of the ineffective assistance claim is\n\nthat the muddled instructions relieved the Commonwealth of its\n\nburden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt on the question of\n\nmalice, insofar as the issue was raised of manslaughter by heat of\n\npassion or sudden provocation.\n\n           As to the first ineffective assistance prong, whether\n\ncounsel's conduct in failing to object \"fell below an objective\n\nstandard of reasonableness,\" Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688, we are\n\n\n                                              -26-\n\fdoubtful.       \"[T]he proper measure of attorney performance remains\n\nsimply    reasonableness        under      prevailing       professional   norms.\"\n\nWiggins, 539 U.S. at 521 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).                 Lynch has to show that no\n\ncompetent lawyer would have reasonably permitted these instructions\n\nto be given without objection.             See Dugas v. Coplan, 428 F.3d 317,\n\n328 (1st Cir. 2005) (question is \"whether, given the particular\n\nfacts    of    this   case,   [counsel]      fell    below    the   constitutional\n\nstandard of competence\").         He has not made such a showing.\n\n               Trial counsel had put evidence of hallucination and\n\nstuporous misunderstanding in front of the jury, through the\n\ntestimony of the defendant and his expert, and had suggested that\n\nLynch lacked malice because this was an accident.                       There were\n\nrepeated strong instructions on the government's bearing the burden\n\nof proof on showing malice, which were correctly stated.                     It is\n\ntrue the jury was also incorrectly instructed that the government\n\nhad to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Lynch did act in the\n\nheat of passion or on sudden provocation.                     This misstates the\n\ngovernment's burden of proof.           We cannot say that \"any reasonably\n\ncompetent attorney,\" Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 525, would have deemed\n\nthe instructions so central to his case and so confusing that they\n\nposed a risk to Lynch, absolutely demanding an objection. The main\n\ndefense       theme   was   absence   of    malice    due    to   the   defendant's\n\n\n\n\n                                        -27-\n\falcohol-induced haze, which may have led Lynch to use excessive\n\nforce in self-defense.\n\n          Moreover, even if counsel's performance were deficient,\n\nwe think it extremely unlikely the jury verdict would have been\n\naffected by it.   It is very doubtful that the jury misunderstood\n\nthe burden of proof as to each element of the case, including\n\nmalice.   And the defense's main theme rested primarily not on\n\nmanslaughter by heat of passion or sudden provocation, but on\n\nLynch's incapacity to have had the requisite intent because his\n\nalcoholism and mental condition had robbed him of the ability to\n\nhave such an intent, including in his own defense.        As the SJC\n\nnoted, \"the 'center of gravity' of the charge plainly rested on the\n\nside of the correct instruction,\" and the charge, \"read as a whole,\n\ncould not have been understood to relieve the Commonwealth of its\n\nburden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt every element of the\n\ncrime.\"   Lynch, 789 N.E.2d at 1061.      The jury almost certainly\n\nrejected Lynch's claim of mitigating circumstances not because the\n\ngovernment failed to prove the mitigating factors, but rather\n\nbecause the jury believed the government had disproved mitigation\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.      Lynch has not met the Strickland\n\nprejudice standard.\n\n          In   theory,   Strickland    attacks   (including   its   own\n\nprejudice prong) go to the separate \"cause\" as opposed to the\n\n\"prejudice\" standards for overcoming default.     See, e.g., Carrier,\n\n\n                                -28-\n\f477 U.S. at 487-88; Horton, 370 F.3d at 83 (because petitioner\n\nfailed to establish ineffective assistance of counsel, he had not\n\ndemonstrated cause for procedural default); Gunter, 291 F.3d at 81-\n\n82.   However, in this circuit, we have held that Strickler v.\n\nGreene, 527 U.S. 263 (1999), requires a finding that if a habeas\n\npetitioner can meet the prejudice standard needed to establish\n\nineffective   assistance   under    Strickland,   then   the   prejudice\n\nstandard under the \"cause and prejudice\" showing to excuse a\n\nprocedural default is also met.      Prou v. United States, 199 F.3d\n\n37, 49 (1st Cir. 1999).      Prou involved the habeas statute for\n\nprisoners in federal custody, 28 U.S.C. ยง 2255, but Strickler\n\nitself involved a state prisoner, and the logic of Prou extends to\n\n28 U.S.C. ยง 2254.     We so held in Evicci v. Maloney, 387 F.3d 37\n\n(1st Cir. 2004).    See id. at 40; see also Lattimore v. Dubois, 311\n\nF.3d 46, 56 n.7 (1st Cir. 2002).          Since Lynch has not met the\n\nprejudice standard under Strickland, he has also not met the\n\nprejudice standard to excuse procedural default.\n\n          As a result, we do not reach the merits of the jury\n\ninstruction issue, because an adequate and independent state ground\n\nstands in the way.      It should be clear, though, that if Lynch\n\ncannot meet the prejudice requirement under Strickland about the\n\nfailure to object to the instructional error, he is quite unlikely\n\nto show, were we to reach the question on the merits, that the SJC\n\nwas unreasonable in its decision on the merits.\n\n\n                                   -29-\n\f                               III.\n\n          The district court's denial of the petition for a writ of\n\nhabeas corpus is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -30-\n\f",

Lynch Jr. was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. He appealed, and the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) affirmed his conviction and affirmed the denial of various post-trial motions. <i>See Commonwealth v. Lynch,</i> 439 Mass. 532, 789 N.E.2d 1052, 1062 (2003), <i>cert. denied,</i> 540 U.S. 1059, 124 S.Ct. 833, 157 L.Ed.2d 715 (2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lynch filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the federal district court. The court denied the petition on all grounds. Lynch then applied for a certificate of appealability (COA) as to the denial of the writ. He sought and obtained the COA for only one of the grounds in his habeas petition &#8212; a due process claim based on an argument that the state trial court's garbled jury instructions effectively relieved the prosecution of the burden of proving malice beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the petition under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254. The respondents have two arguments. The first is that, under the particulars of habeas law, Lynch cannot get to federal review of the merits of the constitutional jury instruction issue unless he shows cause for and prejudice from the independent and adequate state ground of procedural waiver based on his failure to object at trial to the instructions. Lynch, in turn, attempts to show cause and prejudice to excuse his procedural default by asserting ineffective assistance of trial counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The respondents alternatively argue that if the merits are reached, then the standard of review is that the SJC's conclusions must be \"contrary to\" or an \"unreasonable application\" of federal constitutional law, and they are neither. Lynch replies that the SJC did not address the federal constitutional question, and that on de novo review, he is entitled to relief.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> This latter dispute raises a question of the closeness of the match between the SJC's \"center of gravity\" test and federal constitutional tests for evaluating error in jury instructions. We never reach that issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the district court's denial of the habeas petition on the ground that Lynch has failed to show cause and prejudice to excuse his procedural default.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Underlying State Crime</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts are described as they were found by the SJC, supplemented with other facts from the record that are consistent with the SJC's findings. We must \"accept the state court findings of fact unless [Lynch] convinces us, by clear and convincing evidence, that they are in error.\" <i>McCambridge v. Hall,</i> 303 F.3d 24, 26 (1st Cir.2002) (en banc) (citing 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(e)(1)); <i>see also Smiley v. Maloney,</i> 422 F.3d 17, 19 n. 1 (1st Cir. 2005). Lynch recounts the facts somewhat differently to this court, but he does not argue that the SJC's description of what happened is in error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1992, Lynch lived and worked on a hog farm in Lakeville, Massachusetts. Early in the afternoon of June 5, he went to Taunton and began drinking. Within several hours, he had consumed twelve to fourteen bottles of beer. At around 7:00 p.m., he moved to another bar, where he drank more beer, leaving only once at around 9:30 p.m.; he bought a pint of vodka and returned with it within ten minutes. When that bar closed at 1:00 a.m., Lynch remained \"huddled in a doorway,\" continuing to drink from his bottle of vodka and napping. At 6:00 a.m., he had breakfast at a luncheonette, and then he returned to the second bar, where he resumed drinking. By 2:00 p.m., when he left the bar, Lynch had consumed approximately fourteen more alcoholic drinks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lynch left the bar in the company of Andrea Geremia, who had agreed to have sex with him for money. The two took a taxicab to Lynch's cottage on the grounds of the hog farm. Lynch had two beers, and Geremia had a soft drink. Lynch gave Geremia fifty dollars, and they went to the bedroom, where Lynch passed out before a sexual act was completed. Lynch awoke when he heard \"the sound of a squeaky dresser drawer being opened.\" He concluded that Geremia, who was walking away from the drawer and who had her hand down her shirt, had stolen money from him. He became angry and followed Geremia to the kitchen. She turned on him, holding a ten-inch boning knife. Lynch \"easily overpowered\" her; he is six feet, two inches tall and then weighed 180 pounds, and she was \"much smaller.\" Lynch grabbed the knife from Geremia and stabbed her. According to a forensic pathologist, Geremia had been stabbed five times in the chest and abdomen, each time receiving a wound that by itself would have been fatal. She had also been wounded twice on her back and side. Lynch watched her bleed to death. The next day, he buried her body in a trench on the farm used for disposing of dead pigs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lynch was incarcerated on unrelated charges and confided in another inmate, who told another; the police eventually interviewed Lynch's confidant. Using the information they obtained, the police discovered Geremia's body on January 4, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Trial in the Massachusetts Superior Court</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lynch was charged with murder in the first degree. Lynch's defense at trial was that he had stabbed Geremia in self-defense or by accident, and that his \"sense of reality was altered\" at the time of the stabbing because of his heavy drinking. He testified he did not intentionally stab Geremia; the stabbing was inadvertent and happened during a struggle in which Geremia tried to stab him with the knife, kneed him in the groin, and slapped him. Lynch and his trial counsel reenacted the struggle for the jury (Lynch as himself, counsel as Geremia). Lynch testified that when he realized Geremia had been stabbed, he tried to stop her bleeding by pressing a towel onto the stab wound. The defense also presented evidence of Lynch's heavy consumption of alcohol earlier and expert testimony about the effects of alcohol addiction and excessive drinking. The expert opined that when Lynch awoke from his passed-out state, he would have felt numb and could have been in a \"blackout\" or \"hallucinating\" when Geremia was stabbed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defense counsel's closing argument focused on Lynch's extreme intoxication and lack of sleep &#8212; as counsel put it, \"[h]e drank and he drank and he drank\" before going home with Geremia, and then he drank some more. Counsel argued that Geremia had violated Lynch's rights and the sanctity of Lynch's home by stealing money from the dresser, but this was presented not as justification for an attack on Geremia, but rather as the precursor to Lynch's simply asking Geremia to leave. Counsel stressed not rage, but the notion that Lynch \"didn't know what [Geremia] was capable of\" once Geremia \"pull[ed] a knife.\" Lynch reacted as any reasonable person would: he tried to get the knife out of Geremia's hand, whereupon she \"took a swipe at his hand,\" and a struggle ensued, in which Geremia continued to kick and hit Lynch, until at some point Lynch noticed some blood. Lynch then \"panicked,\" tried to stop the bleeding with a towel, and ultimately concealed Geremia's body on the grounds of the hog farm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counsel suggested that the supposed \"multiple stab wounds\" had actually occurred later on, when Geremia's body was being recovered. Counsel portrayed Lynch as \"scared\" and concluded that the killing \"was self-defense, and it was an accident,\" that \"[a]t the very worst . . . it was recklessness,\" and that there \"certainly wasn't malice.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the heart of Lynch's habeas argument are the jury instructions distinguishing murder from voluntary manslaughter. At the beginning of the jury charge, the trial judge correctly instructed the jury that \"[a]ll of my instructions are equally important. Do not single out some and ignore others.\" The court also stated that \"[w]e can't decide that one law is a good law and another is a bad law . . . . You must accept the entire law that I'm going to give you.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When it came to the substantive law governing the charges, the court started with murder: \"Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice afore-thought. Murder committed with deliberately premeditated malice aforethought or with extreme atrocity or cruelty is murder in the first degree. Murder which does not appear to be murder in the first degree is murder in the second degree.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On malice itself and on voluntary manslaughter, the court said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he crime is voluntary manslaughter, not murder, if malice is negated by reasonable sudden provocation or sudden combat or at least by a reasonable doubt whether those circumstances were absent. I will . . . instruct you on voluntary manslaughter in a few minutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The existence of malice has not been proved if you find the death resulted when the defendant was in the state of hot blood upon a reasonable provocation or sudden combat or in the exercise of self-defense, however excessive you find the use of force to have been in the circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court told the jury not to draw an inference of malice \"unless you are persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant's specific intent did not arise in his mind when he was in a state of hot blood upon a reasonable provocation or sudden combat or in the exercise of self-defense.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After explaining first&#8212; and second-degree murder, and stating multiple times that to prove murder the Commonwealth had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt malice and other elements, the court explained that if the Commonwealth had not proved murder, the jury \"must then consider whether the Commonwealth has proved the lesser included offense of manslaughter.\" The court defined manslaughter as \"the unlawful killing of a person by another without malice aforethought.\" The court explained that certain mitigating circumstances negate malice, and if they are present, \"even though the defendant has committed an unlawful killing the crime is manslaughter and not murder.\" The court said that one type of manslaughter is voluntary manslaughter, which it defined as</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">an unlawful intentional killing resulting from a sudden transport of the passions of fear, anger, fright, nervous excitement or heat of blood, when there is no time to deliberate and when such passion or heat of blood is produced by adequate or reasonable provocation and without malice, or upon sudden combat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, the court gave the instructions about which Lynch complains: \"In order to prove the defendant guilty of voluntary manslaughter <i>the Commonwealth must prove three elements beyond a reasonable doubt:</i> first, that the defendant inflicted an injury upon Andrea Geremia from which she died; <i>second, that the defendant injured Andrea Geremia as a result of a sudden combat or in the heat of passion or using excessive force in self-defense;</i> and third, that the homicide was committed unlawfully, without legal excuse or justification, and was not an accident.\" (emphases added) We highlight the portion of the court's language &#8212; what Lynch calls an \"inversion\" &#8212; that puts the burden on the Commonwealth to prove the mitigating factors that negate malice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Right after this, the court confusingly stated that the burden was on the Commonwealth to <i>disprove</i> these mitigating factors: \"Where there is evidence of provocation the Commonwealth has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in the heat of passion.\" The court added that \"[t]he Commonwealth has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in the heat of passion or on sudden provocation. You may not return a verdict of guilty of murder unless the Commonwealth meets this burden.\" This was followed by another \"inversion,\" described in the footnote below.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Indeed, Lynch claims that in all, there were seven inversions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty of first-degree murder. The jury found that Lynch had committed first-degree murder both \"with deliberately premeditated malice aforethought\" and \"with extreme atrocity or cruelty.\" The court sentenced Lynch to life imprisonment. His post-trial motions for a new trial and other requests were denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>The SJC Ruling on Lynch's Direct Appeal and Appeal From Denial of Post-Trial Motions</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lynch appealed his conviction and from the denial of various post-trial motions, including a motion for a new trial. The appeals were consolidated before the SJC. <i>See Lynch,</i> 789 N.E.2d at 1054. One of the claims Lynch raised before the SJC was that the trial judge's \"instruction regarding voluntary manslaughter impermissibly shifted the burden of proof on provocation, thereby creating a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>Id.</i> The SJC agreed that there had been error,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> but observed that there had been no objection to it, and so the error was subject only to limited review. <i>See id.</i> at 1060. Noting the trial judge's other, correct, statements of the law and analogizing to <i>Commonwealth v.

The SJC also rejected Lynch's other claims, including a separate claim for ineffective assistance of counsel as to matters unrelated to the jury instructions, and affirmed the trial court in all respects. <i>See id.</i> at 1054, 1062.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. <i>Federal Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lynch then filed a petition in the U.S. District Court for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> asserting four claims,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> of which only the first is of concern.

The court, citing <i>Ortiz v. Dubois,</i> 19 F.3d 708 (1st Cir.1994), correctly held that Lynch's failure to raise his objection to the jury instructions at trial constituted an independent and adequate state ground that was sufficient to foreclose federal habeas review of the alleged error, absent a showing of cause and prejudice. <i>See id.</i> at 714 (citing <i>Wainwright v. Sykes,</i> 433 U.S. 72, 84, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977)). The court correctly noted that Lynch could only avoid the effect of the procedural default by showing cause for and prejudice from his failure to object. <i>See id.</i> (citing <i>Wainwright,</i> 433 U.S. at 84, 97 S.Ct. 2497). The court determined that because Lynch had only offered speculation that the jury relied on the incorrect instructions, he had not met the required prejudice showing that the error put him at an actual and substantial disadvantage and infected his entire trial with error of constitutional dimensions. <i>See id.</i> The court denied ground one of Lynch's petition.

The ultimate dispute on the merits is about the consequences of the error. The SJC held that \"the `center of gravity' of the charge plainly rested on the side of the correct instruction,\" and that there was thus not \"a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.\" <i>Lynch,</i> 789 N.E.2d at 1061. Lynch, however, says that the instructions \"created the significant possibility that [he] was erroneously convicted of murder in the first degree instead of manslaughter.\" <i>Commonwealth v.

In some instances, state defense counsel's ineffectiveness at trial in failing to preserve a claim for review in state court will suffice to establish such cause. <i>See id.</i> at 487-88, 106 S.Ct. 2639. But that ineffectiveness must rise to the level of being a constitutional violation under <i>Strickland v. Washington,</i> 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). <i>See Gunter v. Maloney,</i> 291 F.3d 74, 81, 82 n. 2 (1st Cir.2002). A habeas petitioner complaining of ineffective assistance of counsel as a basis to show cause for procedural default must show (1) \"that counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\" <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052 and (2) that \"any deficiencies in counsel's performance [were] prejudicial to the defense,\" <i>id.</i> at 692, 104 S.Ct. 2052, in that \"there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different,\" <i>id.</i> at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has recently elaborated on the <i>Strickland</i> prejudice prong.

Smith,</i> 539 U.S. 510, 536, 123 S.Ct. 2527, 156 L.Ed.2d 471 (2003).

The Supreme Court has stressed \"the inseparability of the exhaustion rule and the procedural-default doctrine.\" <i>Carpenter,</i> 529 U.S. at 452, 120 S.Ct. 1587. And so, a habeas petitioner can default on presenting an ineffective assistance claim even when the claim is offered as a reason to show cause and prejudice for his default on a different constitutional claim. Of course, he can try to show cause and prejudice to excuse the default of the ineffective assistance claim in order to show cause and prejudice to excuse his procedural default of the different constitutional claim he wants to present. <i>Id.</i> at 453, 120 S.Ct. 1587. Lynch does not present such an argument: he says he did present to the SJC an ineffective assistance claim on the failure to object to the jury instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the question of cause, the respondents make two arguments which put stumbling blocks<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> in the way. The respondents argue first that Lynch procedurally defaulted on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel <i>as to the jury instructions.</i> Respondents made this procedural default claim for the first time at oral argument, and their precise argument is unclear. They twice asserted that Lynch's ineffective assistance of counsel claim on the jury instructions issue \"was never brought up.\" But they also stated that Lynch did assert ineffective assistance on the jury instructions before the SJC, and that the problem occurred in the trial court, where Lynch failed to include in his motion for a new trial a specific claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as to the jury instructions. If it were clear that Lynch did not include in his ineffective assistance claim to the SJC the failure to object to the jury instructions, his case would be over.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Respondents' second argument, and the one advanced in their brief, is that if such an ineffective assistance claim were presented, the SJC effectively disposed of it on the prejudice prong when it held that there was not \"a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.\" <i>Lynch,</i> 789 N.E.2d at 1061. We accept neither argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the first argument, it is clear from the record that Lynch did flatly raise before the SJC an ineffective assistance claim based on counsel's failure to object to the jury instructions, and it is clear that the Commonwealth replied directly to this argument.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> The fact that the SJC failed to discuss this ineffective assistance claim does not mean Lynch did not raise it. To the extent respondents say the default occurred earlier, in Lynch's motion for a new trial, this point was not raised in the Commonwealth's brief to the SJC, and the SJC did not say the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as to the jury instructions was foreclosed because of failure to comply with state procedural rules.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second argument raises the question of whether the SJC, in applying the state rule for unobjected-to jury instructions and in concluding that there was no \"substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice,\" essentially used the same test as that under <i>Strickland's</i> prejudice prong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject the second argument for two reasons. First, the SJC did not purport to do an ineffective assistance analysis on this point, and second, the two standards (for review of unpreserved error and for prejudice under <i>Strickland</i>) have not been shown by respondents to be the same. We reject respondents' implicit, unelaborated argument that the <i>Strickland</i> prejudice prong is no more than a miscarriage of justice test. The SJC neither overtly nor implicitly adjudicated the jury instructions issue as an ineffective assistance claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Mello v. DiPaulo,</i> 295 F.3d 137 (1st Cir.2002), we considered on habeas an unobjected-to jury instruction error and evaluated whether there was \"a probability[,] sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome,\" <i>id.</i> at 142 (quoting <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052), that the instruction error \"could . . . have affected the verdict the jury returned,\" <i>id.</i> at 149. This is the <i>Strickland</i> prejudice standard. <i>See Rompilla v. Beard,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 125 S.Ct. 2456, 2469, 162 L.Ed.2d 360 (2005); <i>Wiggins,</i> 539 U.S. at 538, 123 S.Ct. 2527.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, the SJC's standard for ineffective assistance of counsel, articulated in <i>Commonwealth v. Saferian,</i> 366 Mass. 89, 315 N.E.2d 878, 883 (1974), is the functional equivalent of the <i>Strickland</i> standard. <i>See Mello,</i> 295 F.3d at 143-44; <i>Scarpa v. DuBois,</i> 38 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.1994). The <i>Saferian</i> standard is \"whether there has been serious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention of counsel &#8212; behavior of counsel falling measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer &#8212; and, if that is found, then, typically, whether it has likely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\" <i>Saferian,</i> 315 N.E.2d at 883.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The standard the SJC did apply in its analysis of the jury instructions issue was the \"substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice\" test. But it did not connect its determination that there was no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice to a finding on ineffective assistance as to the jury instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a pure matter of language, the prejudice prong of <i>Strickland</i> appears to impose a standard more favorable to defendants than a \"substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice\" test. Under <i>Strickland,</i> Lynch must show only that \"there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different,\" <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, as illustrated in <i>Wiggins. See Wiggins,</i> 539 U.S. at 536-38, 123 S.Ct. 2527 (2003) (emphasizing \"reasonable probability that at least one juror would have struck a different balance\"). It may or may not be that the state courts have put a judicial gloss on their substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice standard, but the respondents have not provided argument or citation on this point, and, absent that, we are not prepared to say the state standard is the same as or more favorable than the <i>Strickland</i> prejudice standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the SJC did not address the ineffective assistance issue as to the failure to object to the jury instructions, we review it de novo. <i>Fortini,</i> 257 F.3d at 47.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a matter of our independent review, we find no <i>Strickland</i> error in counsel's failure to object to the jury instructions. The premise of the ineffective assistance claim is that the muddled instructions relieved the Commonwealth of its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt on the question of malice, insofar as the issue was raised of manslaughter by heat of passion or sudden provocation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the first ineffective assistance prong, whether counsel's conduct in failing to object \"fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\" <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, we are doubtful. \"[T]he proper measure of attorney performance remains simply reasonableness under prevailing professional norms.\" <i>Wiggins,</i> 539 U.S. at 521, 123 S.Ct. 2527 (quoting <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052) (internal quotation marks omitted). Lynch has to show that no competent lawyer would have reasonably permitted these instructions to be given without objection. See <i>Dugas v. Coplan,</i> 428 F.3d 317, 328 (1st Cir.2005) (question is \"whether, given the particular facts of this case, [counsel] fell below the constitutional standard of competence\"). He has not made such a showing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial counsel had put evidence of hallucination and stuporous misunderstanding in front of the jury, through the testimony of the defendant and his expert, and had suggested that Lynch lacked malice because this was an accident. There were repeated strong instructions on the government's bearing the burden of proof on showing malice, which were correctly stated. It is true the jury was also incorrectly instructed that the government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Lynch did act in the heat of passion or on sudden provocation. This misstates the government's burden of proof. We cannot say that \"any reasonably competent attorney,\" <i>Wiggins,</i> 539 U.S. at 525, 123 S.Ct. 2527, would have deemed the instructions so central to his case and so confusing that they posed a risk to Lynch, absolutely demanding an objection. The main defense theme was absence of malice due to the defendant's alcohol-induced haze, which may have led Lynch to use excessive force in self-defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, even if counsel's performance were deficient, we think it extremely unlikely the jury verdict would have been affected by it. It is very doubtful that the jury misunderstood the burden of proof as to each element of the case, including malice. And the defense's main theme rested primarily not on manslaughter by heat of passion or sudden provocation, but on Lynch's incapacity to have had the requisite intent because his alcoholism and mental condition had robbed him of the ability to have such an intent, including in his own defense. As the SJC noted, \"the `center of gravity' of the charge plainly rested on the side of the correct instruction,\" and the charge, \"read as a whole, could not have been understood to relieve the Commonwealth of its burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt every element of the crime.\" <i>Lynch,</i> 789 N.E.2d at 1061. The jury almost certainly rejected Lynch's claim of mitigating circumstances not because the government failed to prove the mitigating factors, but rather because the jury believed the government had disproved mitigation beyond a reasonable doubt. Lynch has not met the <i>Strickland</i> prejudice standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In theory, <i>Strickland</i> attacks (including its own prejudice prong) go to the separate \"cause\" as opposed to the \"prejudice\" standards for overcoming default. <i>See, e.g., Carrier,</i> 477 U.S. at 487-88, 106 S.Ct. 2639; <i>Horton,</i> 370 F.3d at 83 (because petitioner failed to establish ineffective assistance of counsel, he had not demonstrated cause for procedural default); <i>Gunter,</i> 291 F.3d at 81-82. However, in this circuit, we have held that <i>Strickler v. Greene,</i> 527 U.S. 263, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999), requires a finding that if a habeas petitioner can meet the prejudice standard needed to establish ineffective assistance under <i>Strickland,</i> then the prejudice standard under the \"cause and prejudice\" showing to excuse a procedural default is also met. <i>Prou v. United States,</i> 199 F.3d 37, 49 (1st Cir.1999). <i>Prou</i> involved the habeas statute for prisoners in federal custody, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255, but <i>Strickler</i> itself involved a state prisoner, and the logic of <i>Prou</i> extends to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254. We so held in <i>Evicci v. Maloney,</i> 387 F.3d 37 (1st Cir.2004). <i>See id.</i> at 40; <i>see also Lattimore v. Dubois,</i> 311 F.3d 46, 56 n. 7 (1st Cir.2002). Since Lynch has not met the prejudice standard under <i>Strickland,</i> he has also not met the prejudice standard to excuse procedural default.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result, we do not reach the merits of the jury instruction issue, because an adequate and independent state ground stands in the way. It should be clear, though, that if Lynch cannot meet the prejudice requirement under <i>Strickland</i> about the failure to object to the instructional error, he is quite unlikely to show, were we to reach the question on the merits, that the SJC was unreasonable in its decision on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's denial of the petition for a writ of habeas corpus is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> On the jury instruction issue, each party's brief applied the standard of review more favorable to the other side, and then each party changed its mind at oral argument.

The court denied the petition on all grounds. Lynch then applied for a certificate of appealability (COA) as to the denial of the writ. He sought and obtained the COA for only one of the grounds in his habeas petition &#8212; a due process claim based on an argument that the state trial court's garbled jury instructions effectively relieved the prosecution of the burden of proving malice beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the petition under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254. The respondents have two arguments. The first is that, under the particulars of habeas law, Lynch cannot get to federal review of the merits of the constitutional jury instruction issue unless he shows cause for and prejudice from the independent and adequate state ground of procedural waiver based on his failure to object at trial to the instructions. Lynch, in turn, attempts to show cause and prejudice to excuse his procedural default by asserting ineffective assistance of trial counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The respondents alternatively argue that if the merits are reached, then the standard of review is that the SJC's conclusions must be \"contrary to\" or an \"unreasonable application\" of federal constitutional law, and they are neither. Lynch replies that the SJC did not address the federal constitutional question, and that on de novo review, he is entitled to relief.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> This latter dispute raises a question of the closeness of the match between the SJC's \"center of gravity\" test and federal constitutional tests for evaluating error in jury instructions.

Early in the afternoon of June 5, he went to Taunton and began drinking. Within several hours, he had consumed twelve to fourteen bottles of beer. At around 7:00 p.m., he moved to another bar, where he drank more beer, leaving only once at around 9:30 p.m.; he bought a pint of vodka and returned with it within ten minutes. When that bar closed at 1:00 a.m., Lynch remained \"huddled in a doorway,\" continuing to drink from his bottle of vodka and napping. At 6:00 a.m., he had breakfast at a luncheonette, and then he returned to the second bar, where he resumed drinking. By 2:00 p.m., when he left the bar, Lynch had consumed approximately fourteen more alcoholic drinks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lynch left the bar in the company of Andrea Geremia, who had agreed to have sex with him for money. The two took a taxicab to Lynch's cottage on the grounds of the hog farm. Lynch had two beers, and Geremia had a soft drink. Lynch gave Geremia fifty dollars, and they went to the bedroom, where Lynch passed out before a sexual act was completed. Lynch awoke when he heard \"the sound of a squeaky dresser drawer being opened.\" He concluded that Geremia, who was walking away from the drawer and who had her hand down her shirt, had stolen money from him. He became angry and followed Geremia to the kitchen. She turned on him, holding a ten-inch boning knife. Lynch \"easily overpowered\" her; he is six feet, two inches tall and then weighed 180 pounds, and she was \"much smaller.\" Lynch grabbed the knife from Geremia and stabbed her. According to a forensic pathologist, Geremia had been stabbed five times in the chest and abdomen, each time receiving a wound that by itself would have been fatal. She had also been wounded twice on her back and side. Lynch watched her bleed to death. The next day, he buried her body in a trench on the farm used for disposing of dead pigs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lynch was incarcerated on unrelated charges and confided in another inmate, who told another; the police eventually interviewed Lynch's confidant. Using the information they obtained, the police discovered Geremia's body on January 4, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Trial in the Massachusetts Superior Court</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lynch was charged with murder in the first degree. Lynch's defense at trial was that he had stabbed Geremia in self-defense or by accident, and that his \"sense of reality was altered\" at the time of the stabbing because of his heavy drinking. He testified he did not intentionally stab Geremia; the stabbing was inadvertent and happened during a struggle in which Geremia tried to stab him with the knife, kneed him in the groin, and slapped him. Lynch and his trial counsel reenacted the struggle for the jury (Lynch as himself, counsel as Geremia). Lynch testified that when he realized Geremia had been stabbed, he tried to stop her bleeding by pressing a towel onto the stab wound. The defense also presented evidence of Lynch's heavy consumption of alcohol earlier and expert testimony about the effects of alcohol addiction and excessive drinking. The expert opined that when Lynch awoke from his passed-out state, he would have felt numb and could have been in a \"blackout\" or \"hallucinating\" when Geremia was stabbed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defense counsel's closing argument focused on Lynch's extreme intoxication and lack of sleep &#8212; as counsel put it, \"[h]e drank and he drank and he drank\" before going home with Geremia, and then he drank some more. Counsel argued that Geremia had violated Lynch's rights and the sanctity of Lynch's home by stealing money from the dresser, but this was presented not as justification for an attack on Geremia, but rather as the precursor to Lynch's simply asking Geremia to leave. Counsel stressed not rage, but the notion that Lynch \"didn't know what [Geremia] was capable of\" once Geremia \"pull[ed] a knife.\" Lynch reacted as any reasonable person would: he tried to get the knife out of Geremia's hand, whereupon she \"took a swipe at his hand,\" and a struggle ensued, in which Geremia continued to kick and hit Lynch, until at some point Lynch noticed some blood. Lynch then \"panicked,\" tried to stop the bleeding with a towel, and ultimately concealed Geremia's body on the grounds of the hog farm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counsel suggested that the supposed \"multiple stab wounds\" had actually occurred later on, when Geremia's body was being recovered. Counsel portrayed Lynch as \"scared\" and concluded that the killing \"was self-defense, and it was an accident,\" that \"[a]t the very worst . . . it was recklessness,\" and that there \"certainly wasn't malice.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the heart of Lynch's habeas argument are the jury instructions distinguishing murder from voluntary manslaughter. At the beginning of the jury charge, the trial judge correctly instructed the jury that \"[a]ll of my instructions are equally important. Do not single out some and ignore others.\" The court also stated that \"[w]e can't decide that one law is a good law and another is a bad law . . . . You must accept the entire law that I'm going to give you.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When it came to the substantive law governing the charges, the court started with murder: \"Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice afore-thought.

Lynch does not present such an argument: he says he did present to the SJC an ineffective assistance claim on the failure to object to the jury instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the question of cause, the respondents make two arguments which put stumbling blocks<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> in the way. The respondents argue first that Lynch procedurally defaulted on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel <i>as to the jury instructions.</i> Respondents made this procedural default claim for the first time at oral argument, and their precise argument is unclear. They twice asserted that Lynch's ineffective assistance of counsel claim on the jury instructions issue \"was never brought up.\" But they also stated that Lynch did assert ineffective assistance on the jury instructions before the SJC, and that the problem occurred in the trial court, where Lynch failed to include in his motion for a new trial a specific claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as to the jury instructions. If it were clear that Lynch did not include in his ineffective assistance claim to the SJC the failure to object to the jury instructions, his case would be over.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Respondents' second argument, and the one advanced in their brief, is that if such an ineffective assistance claim were presented, the SJC effectively disposed of it on the prejudice prong when it held that there was not \"a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.\" <i>Lynch,</i> 789 N.E.2d at 1061. We accept neither argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the first argument, it is clear from the record that Lynch did flatly raise before the SJC an ineffective assistance claim based on counsel's failure to object to the jury instructions, and it is clear that the Commonwealth replied directly to this argument.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> The fact that the SJC failed to discuss this ineffective assistance claim does not mean Lynch did not raise it. To the extent respondents say the default occurred earlier, in Lynch's motion for a new trial, this point was not raised in the Commonwealth's brief to the SJC, and the SJC did not say the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as to the jury instructions was foreclosed because of failure to comply with state procedural rules.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second argument raises the question of whether the SJC, in applying the state rule for unobjected-to jury instructions and in concluding that there was no \"substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice,\" essentially used the same test as that under <i>Strickland's</i> prejudice prong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject the second argument for two reasons. First, the SJC did not purport to do an ineffective assistance analysis on this point, and second, the two standards (for review of unpreserved error and for prejudice under <i>Strickland</i>) have not been shown by respondents to be the same. We reject respondents' implicit, unelaborated argument that the <i>Strickland</i> prejudice prong is no more than a miscarriage of justice test.

The <i>Saferian</i> standard is \"whether there has been serious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention of counsel &#8212; behavior of counsel falling measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer &#8212; and, if that is found, then, typically, whether it has likely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\" <i>Saferian,</i> 315 N.E.2d at 883.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The standard the SJC did apply in its analysis of the jury instructions issue was the \"substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice\" test.

Under <i>Strickland,</i> Lynch must show only that \"there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different,\" <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 694, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

There were repeated strong instructions on the government's bearing the burden of proof on showing malice, which were correctly stated. It is true the jury was also incorrectly instructed that the government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Lynch did act in the heat of passion or on sudden provocation. This misstates the government's burden of proof. We cannot say that \"any reasonably competent attorney,\" <i>Wiggins,</i> 539 U.S. at 525, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130159\"><a href=\"/opinion/130159/wiggins-v-smith-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2527</span></a></span>, would have deemed the instructions so central to his case and so confusing that they posed a risk to Lynch, absolutely demanding an objection. The main defense theme was absence of malice due to the defendant's alcohol-induced haze, which may have led Lynch to use excessive force in self-defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, even if counsel's performance were deficient, we think it extremely unlikely the jury verdict would have been affected by it. It is very doubtful that the jury misunderstood the burden of proof as to each element of the case, including malice. And the defense's main theme rested primarily not on manslaughter by heat of passion or sudden provocation, but on Lynch's incapacity to have had the requisite intent because his alcoholism and mental condition had robbed him of the ability to have such an intent, including in his own defense. As the SJC noted, \"the `center of gravity' of the charge plainly rested on the side of the correct instruction,\" and the charge, \"read as a whole, could not have been understood to relieve the Commonwealth of its burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt every element of the crime.\" <i>Lynch,</i> 789 N.E.2d at 1061. The jury almost certainly rejected Lynch's claim of mitigating circumstances not because the government failed to prove the mitigating factors, but rather because the jury believed the government had disproved mitigation beyond a reasonable doubt.
