Plaintiff-appellant   DJ\n\nManufacturing (\"DJM\") alleges that Tex-Shield, Inc. (\"Tex-Shield\")\n\nand Creative Apparel Associates (\"Creative Apparel\") violated,\n\ninter alia, a Puerto Rican antitrust statute, 10 P.R. Laws Ann. §\n\n264 (2002), by conspiring to destroy competition in the market for\n\nchemical protective clothing in Puerto Rico.1   The district court\n\ndismissed the complaint on a motion to dismiss.      After careful\n\nreview, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.\n\n                             I.   Facts\n\n          Because this is an appeal from a dismissal under Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. Rule 12(b)(6), \"[w]e glean the facts from the amended\n\ncomplaint, stripped of any rhetorical gloss.\" Young v. Lepone, 305\n\nF.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n          DJM manufactures sewn clothing and equipage for the\n\nUnited States military.   It is a \"small disadvantaged business\"\n\nunder 48 C.F.R. § 19.001 (2003) (and a certified participant in the\n\nSmall Business Administration's program for contracts set aside to\n\nsmall disadvantaged businesses under Section 8(a) of the Small\n\nBusiness Act, 15 U.S.C. § 637(a) (2000).\n\n\n\n\n1\n   The plaintiffs also alleged violations of Sections 1 and 2 of\nthe Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1 and 2, Sections 2(a), (e), and (f)\nof the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 13(a), (e), (f), the\nPuerto Rican statute dealing with price discrimination, 10 L.P.R.A.\n§ 263, and the Puerto Rican statute dealing with transactions in\nrestraint of trade, 10 L.P.R.A. § 258.        The district court's\ndecision is unchallenged with respect to these other claims.\n\n                                  -2-\n\f          Defendant Tex-Shield manufactures, and its parent Blucher\n\nGmbH holds a patent for, technology used to produce a chemical\n\nprotective material known as \"Saratoga Filter Cloth\" (the \"Cloth\").\n\nThe Cloth is a protective shield against biological and chemical\n\nagents sewn into garments purchased by the United States military\n\nand used for protection against attack by chemical warfare.\n\n          In July 1993, the United States Air Force (\"USAF\")\n\nrequested bids for the production of 40,000 Chemical Defense\n\nCoveralls.    The bidding was limited to businesses participating in\n\nthe SBA's § 8(a) program, such as DJM.      The USAF specified that the\n\ncoveralls must be made using the Cloth and identified Tex-Shield as\n\nthe sole source.    DJM won the contract.\n\n             DJM then subcontracted with Tex-Shield to buy the Cloth\n\nfor a price of $49.27 per yard. Subsequently, DJM and Tex-Shield\n\nmade a \"technical services\" contract, whereby, for a fee of $35,000\n\nper month for twelve months, Tex-Shield agreed to provide DJM with\n\ncertain technical services.\n\n             On June 24, 1994, the Defense Personnel Support Center\n\n(\"DPSC\") solicited proposals for the production of at least 100,000\n\nchemical and biological suits, with an option for more.        As with\n\nthe USAF solicitation, the DPSC solicitation was limited to SBA's\n\n§ 8(a) program participants.    Also, the    solicitation required the\n\nsuits be made with the Cloth; again, Tex-Shield was identified as\n\nthe Cloth's sole approved source.\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f            In preparing its bid for DPSC, DJM inquired as to the\n\ncost of procuring the Cloth.     Tex-Shield quoted DJM a price of\n\n$38.71 per yard for the first 100,000 suits, and $41.07 per yard\n\nfor any additional yardage.      Tex-Shield quoted DJM a price of\n\n$148.95 for the first 100,000 suits in pre-cut \"kits\" and $154.43\n\nper kit for any extra kits.     Based on these quotes, DJM offered\n\nDPSC a price of $186.62 per unit for the first 100,000 suits and\n\n$183.50 for any more suits.    Creative Apparel bid $179.55 for the\n\nfirst 100,000 suits and $186.02 for any extra.     Creative won the\n\ncontract.\n\n            DJM filed a complaint against Tex-Shield, Blucher USA,\n\nBlucher GmbH, and Creative Apparel,2 alleging several federal and\n\nstate antitrust violations.     The complaint included allegations\n\nthat Tex-Shield violated § 264 of the Puerto Rico Anti-Monopoly Act\n\nby selling goods in Puerto Rico at prices different from the\n\narticles' price when sold elsewhere.\n\n            The district court dismissed all of the consolidated\n\nactions, including the § 264 count, for failure to state a cause of\n\naction.     See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).   In dismissing the § 264\n\ncount, the district court read the section only as an anti-dumping\n\n\n\n\n2\n   Tex-Shield is wholly-owned by Blucher USA, which in turn is\nwholly-owned by Blucher GmbH. Creative Apparel is, like DJM, a\nclothing and equipage manufacturer. Tex-Shield, the Cloth's sole\nsupplier, also makes finished chemical and biological protective\nclothing.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fstatute, forbidding the sale of goods at lower prices in Puerto\n\nRico.\n\n          DJM appeals only the lower court's dismissal of the § 264\n\ncount, as DJM waived all other appealable errors.\n\n                      II.    Standard of Review\n\n          We review the district court's resolution of Tex-Shield's\n\nmotion to dismiss de novo.    Beddall v. State St. Bank & Trust Co.,\n\n137 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir. 1998).         When a litigant is facing a\n\nsummary dismissal, we first accept the complaint's well-pleaded\n\nfactual allegations as true, drawing all reasonable inferences in\n\nthe plaintiff's favor, and then determine whether this reading of\n\nthe complaint justifies recovery on any cognizable theory.    Martin\n\nv. Applied Cellular Tech., Inc., 284 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\nSummary disposals \"should be used sparingly in complex antitrust\n\nlitigation where motive and intent play leading roles, the proof is\n\nlargely in the hands of alleged conspirators, and hostile witnesses\n\nthicken the plot.\"   Poller v. Columbia Broad. Sys., Inc., 368 U.S.\n\n464, 473 (1962).\n\n                            III.   Analysis\n\n          Two issues require discussion. First, we consider if the\n\ndistrict court erred when it limited the interpretation of the\n\nphrase \"at prices which are substantially different\" to only those\n\nsituations where a supplier offers its product at a substantially\n\nlower price to Puerto Rican customers as opposed to non-Puerto\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fRican customers, and ruled out those situations where a supplier\n\ncharged   the   Puerto   Rican   company    substantially       more   than   a\n\nnon-Puerto Rican company.        Second, we decide if DJM's complaint\n\nalleges sufficient facts to establish a § 264 claim, including\n\nwhether the complaint at least inferentially asserts that (1) Tex-\n\nShield's alleged conduct is aimed at \"destroying competition or\n\neliminating a competitor located in Puerto Rico\"; and (2) the goods\n\nat issue are of the same grade or quality.\n\n           A.   Statutory Interpretation\n\n           Neither this circuit nor the Puerto Rican commonwealth\n\ncourts have determined the pricing behaviors covered by § 264. DJM\n\ncontends that the statute prohibits charging either less or more\n\nfor goods in Puerto Rico.    Thus, DJM argues that the district court\n\nerred when it viewed the statute as an anti-dumping statute that\n\nprohibits only    the    charging   of    lower   prices   in   Puerto   Rico.\n\nFinally, DJM argues that § 264 is clear on its face and that we\n\nshould thus refrain from examining its legislative history.                   We\n\nagree.\n\n           Where the statute's language is clear, and its terms do\n\nnot lead to \"absurd or wholly impracticable consequences,\" the\n\nwords used are generally taken as the final expression of the\n\nintended meaning.    Caminetti v. United States, 242 U.S. 470, 490\n\n(1917); see also United States v. Mo. Pac. R.R., 278 U.S. 269, 277-\n\n78 (1929) (\"where no ambiguity exists, there is no room for\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fconstruction\").            Although      different        canons     of     statutory\n\nconstruction may apply when construing statutes in a civil code\n\nsystem as opposed to statutes in a common law system, we need not\n\nconcern ourselves with these differences because the Puerto Rico\n\nlegislature provides a clear command as to the first step of civil\n\ncode interpretation: \"When a law is clear and free from all\n\nambiguity, the letter of the same shall not be disregarded, under\n\nthe pretext of fulfilling the spirit thereof.\"                 31 P.R. Laws Ann.\n\n§ 14 (1967 & Supp. 1989); see also Pritzker v. Yari, 42 F.3d 53,\n\n66-67 (1st       Cir.    1994)   (declining    to    \"wander       beyond   the   four\n\ncorners\"    of    a     Puerto   Rican   statute     to    discern     \"legislative\n\nintent\").\n\n            Here, the statute is clear regarding the pricing behavior\n\nit targets.      Section 264 states:\n\n            It shall be unlawful to sell, contract to\n            sell, offer to sell, or participate in any\n            step for the sale of articles in Puerto Rico,\n            after making due allowance for differences in\n            costs incident to the delivering of goods in\n            Puerto Rico and the costs of handling such\n            goods in Puerto Rico, at prices which are\n            substantially different from prices charged or\n            quoted by such sellers for goods of the same\n            grade or quality to buyers located outside of\n            Puerto Rico, when such difference in price is\n            granted with the purpose of destroying\n            competition   or  eliminating   a   competitor\n            located in Puerto Rico.\n\n10 P.R. Laws Ann. § 264 (emphasis added).                    Unlike the Federal\n\nAnti-Dumping Act of 1916, which the district court adopted as the\n\ndefinitive model for this statute, there is no specific prohibition\n\n                                         -7-\n\fagainst charging \"a price substantially less\" in Puerto Rico --\n\ninstead the legislature chose the broader term \"substantially\n\ndifferent,\" which covers both higher and lower pricing.3\n\n           Because we hold the statutory language embraces both\n\nhigher and lower prices on its face, we need not enter the quagmire\n\nof legislative history or use other tools of construction.         The\n\ndistrict court judge erred in interpreting the provision too\n\nnarrowly, and that interpretation is reversed.\n\n           B.   Sufficiency of Factual Allegations\n\n           Having decided the statute includes both higher and lower\n\nprice   discrimination,   we   consider   whether    the   complaint's\n\n\n3\n    The Federal Anti-Dumping Act reads in pertinent part:\n\n      It shall be unlawful for any person importing or\n      assisting in importing any articles from any foreign\n      country   into   the   United    States,   commonly   and\n      systematically to import, sell or cause to be imported or\n      sold such articles within the United States at a price\n      substantially less than the actual market value or\n      wholesale price of such articles, at the time of\n      exportation to the United States, in the principal\n      markets of the country of their production, or of other\n      foreign countries to which they are commonly exported\n      after adding to such market value or wholesale price,\n      freight, duty, and other charges and expenses necessarily\n      incident to the importation and sale thereof in the\n      United States: Provided, That such act or acts be done\n      with the intent of destroying or injuring an industry in\n      the United States, or of preventing the establishment of\n      an industry in the United States, or of restraining or\n      monopolizing any part of trade and commerce in such\n      articles in the United States.\n\n15 U.S.C. § 72 (2003) (emphasis added). Clearly, the Puerto Rican\nlegislature did not merely adopt the provision wholesale, but\nrather changed significant portions of it.\n\n                                 -8-\n\fallegations and any logical inferences therefrom \"justify recovery\n\non any cognizable theory.\"                Martin, 284 F.3d at 6.            Here, DJM\n\nclaims that the prices Tex-Shield charged to Creative Apparel were\n\nlower    than      those   quoted    to    DJM    plainly    suffice      to    survive\n\ndismissal.\n\n              Even if the statute applies to the alleged charging of\n\nhigher    prices     in    Puerto    Rico,    there   are    still    two      possible\n\nobstacles to stating a claim under § 264.                First, § 264 prohibits\n\na supplier from charging different prices for the purpose of\n\ndestroying the supplier's \"competition or eliminating a competitor\n\nlocated in Puerto Rico.\"            Second, § 264 requires that the goods be\n\nof \"the same grade and quality.\"                  The district court did not\n\naddress either issue; taking all inferences in DJM's favor, we find\n\nthe district court erred in dismissing the complaint.4\n\n              1.    Adverse Impact on Competition or Competitor\n\n              A well-pleaded § 264 claim must include allegations that\n\nthe   price     discrimination       was    for   \"the   purpose     of   destroying\n\ncompetition or eliminating a competitor located in Puerto Rico.\"\n\nIn its complaint, DJM contends that Tex-Shield and Creative Apparel\n\nentered    into      \"an   agreement\"       involving,      among    other      things,\n\ninvestment by Tex-Shield in Creative Apparel as part of a\n\n              joint strategy to secure and maintain for the\n              Blucher defendants monopoly power in United\n\n\n4\n   This is not a case in which the district court converted the\n12(b)(6) motion into a motion for summary judgment.\n\n                                           -9-\n\f             States   trade  and   commerce   in   Chemical\n             Protective Cloth . . . and to attempt to\n             secure and maintain, and to secure and\n             maintain,   monopoly   power   for    Creative\n             [Apparel] in United States trade and commerce\n             in Chemical Protective Clothing, as well as in\n             such trade and commerce in the § 8(a) market.\n\nIt is not irrational for a monopoly-holder such as Tex-Shield to\n\nact with the intent of sabotaging one of its two customers.5             Such\n\na concerted effort to establish and maintain monopoly power in the\n\nrelevant markets, if proven, would meet § 264's purpose requirement\n\nbecause it would constitute an intent to harm competition in the\n\nchemical protective clothing market or eliminate DJM as Creative\n\nApparel's competitor; thus, DJM's pleadings on this count suffice\n\nto meet § 264's intent requirement.            Compare In re Compact Disc\n\nMinimum Advertised Price Antitrust Litig., 138 F. Supp. 2d 25, 28\n\nn.4 (D. Me. 2001) (denying motion to dismiss where it was \"not\n\nirrational    or   implausible   to    infer   agreement   from   the   facts\n\nalleged\"), with DM Research, Inc. v. Coll. of Am. Pathologists, 170\n\nF.3d 53, 55-56 (1st Cir. 1999) (affirming dismissal where complaint\n\n\"merely assert[ed] a conspiracy in conclusory terms\" and stating\n\nthat allegation of some fact pertaining to an agreement would be\n\n\n\n5\n   Both the allegation that Tex-Shield is building \"additional\nmanufacturing operations\" near Creative Apparel's plant and the\nclaim that Tex-Shield is investing in Creative Apparel to \"enhance\nits financial condition\" could, if proven, support a finding of an\nanti-competitive purpose to the price differential. Both of these\nfacts suggest a special relationship between Tex-Shield and\nCreative Apparel that would make it logical for them to conspire to\ndestroy competition in the chemical protective clothing market.\n\n                                      -10-\n\fnecessary to overcome the improbability of a conspiracy against the\n\ninterests of one or more of the parties).\n\n          2.   Goods of Same Grade and Quality\n\n          Finally, § 264 requires that DJM allege that Tex-Shield\n\nwas quoting different prices for \"goods of the same grade or\n\nquality.\" Defendants argue that \"the goods for which DJM requested\n\na price -- pre-cut fabric kits -- were not the same grade or\n\nquality as the goods on which Creative Apparel requested a price --\n\nuncut cloth on the roll.\"   Although this argument may ultimately\n\nhave merit, it does not preclude inferences from the complaint\n\nsufficient to defeat a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.\n\n          It is possible to infer from the complaint that the goods\n\nat issue were of the same grade and quality.      According to the\n\ncomplaint, a DPSC report indicates that \"Defendant Tex-shield had,\n\nin fact, offered the Blucher Chemical Protective Cloth to Creative\n\nat a significantly lower price than it had offered the cloth to\n\nDJM.\"   Given that the final product, the chemical protective\n\nclothing, had to be produced according to military specifications\n\nthat included use of the Cloth, it is a reasonable inference --\n\nwithout considering any contrary proof -- that the goods at issue\n\n(the Cloth) had to be of the same grade and quality.6   Cf.   Arruda\n\n\n6\n   We find the defendant's reliance on Lubbock Glass & Mirror Co.\nv. Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co., 313 F. Supp. 1184, 1187 (N.D. Tex.\n1970), unfounded. In Lubbock Glass, the court found that glass,\ndoors, frames and windows could not be considered of like kind and\nquality when conveyed in different contracting jobs, because\n\n                               -11-\n\fv.   Sears,    Roebuck   &   Co.,   310   F.3d   13,    18   (1st   Cir.   2002)\n\n(indicating that in evaluating propriety of 12(b)(6) motion, the\n\ncourt must \"assume the truth of all well-pleaded facts and indulge\n\nall reasonable inferences therefrom that fit the plaintiff's stated\n\ntheory of liability\").\n\n                              IV.   Conclusion\n\n              For the foregoing reasons, the district court's dismissal\n\nof the complaint is reversed and the case is remanded for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.              We intimate no view as\n\nto whether, after pretrial discovery, trialworthy issues will be\n\nshown to exist.\n\n              Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n\"intangible items, such as installation, weather conditions, the\narchitect or contractor in charge of the job and other intangibles\nmake each job unique or different.\"    Id. at 1185.    Further the\ncourt stated that\n\n      commercial installed contracts . . . are a combination of\n      many ingredients, none of which are subject to exact\n      calculation. A difference in one ingredient could and\n      probably would occasion a difference in the total price\n      or bid. Apparently, someone calculating a bid for a\n      commercial installed contract cannot even determine\n      exactly the material costs involved.\n\nId. at 1186-87. The Cloth needed by both DJM and Creative is the\nsame and the costs involved are easily estimated, as shown by DJM's\nown calculation of cutting costs.\n\n                                     -12-\n\f",

The Cloth is a protective shield against biological and chemical agents sewn into garments purchased by the United States military and used for protection against attack by chemical warfare.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1993, the United States Air Force (\"USAF\") requested bids for the production of 40,000 Chemical Defense Coveralls. The bidding was limited to businesses participating in the SBA's &#167; 8(a) program, such as DJM. The USAF specified that the coveralls must be made using the Cloth and identified Tex-Shield as the sole source. DJM won the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DJM then subcontracted with Tex-Shield to buy the Cloth for a price of $49.27 per yard. Subsequently, DJM and Tex-Shield made a \"technical services\" contract, whereby, for a fee of $35,000 per month for twelve months, Tex-Shield agreed to provide DJM with certain technical services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 24, 1994, the Defense Personnel Support Center (\"DPSC\") solicited proposals for the production of at least 100,000 chemical and biological suits, with an option for more. As with the USAF solicitation, the DPSC solicitation was limited to SBA's &#167; 8(a) program participants. Also, the solicitation required the suits be made with the Cloth; again, Tex-Shield was identified as the Cloth's sole approved source.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In preparing its bid for DPSC, DJM inquired as to the cost of procuring the Cloth. Tex-Shield quoted DJM a price of $38.71 per yard for the first 100,000 suits, and $41.07 per yard for any additional yardage. Tex-Shield quoted DJM a price of $148.95 for the first 100,000 suits in pre-cut \"kits\" and $154.43 per kit for any extra kits. Based on these quotes, DJM offered DPSC a price of $186.62 per unit for the first 100,000 suits and $183.50 for any more suits. Creative Apparel bid $179.55 for the first 100,000 suits and $186.02 for any extra. Creative won the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DJM filed a complaint against Tex-Shield, Blucher USA, Blucher GmbH, and Creative Apparel,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> alleging several federal and state antitrust violations. The complaint included allegations that Tex-Shield violated &#167; 264 of the Puerto Rico Anti-Monopoly Act by selling goods in Puerto Rico at prices different from the articles' price when sold elsewhere.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court dismissed all of the consolidated actions, including the &#167; 264 count, for failure to state a cause of action. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). In dismissing the &#167; 264 count, the district court read the section only as an anti-dumping statute, forbidding the sale of goods at lower prices in Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DJM appeals only the lower court's dismissal of the &#167; 264 count, as DJM waived all other appealable errors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's resolution of Tex-Shield's motion to dismiss de novo. Beddall v. State St. Bank &amp; Trust Co., 137 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir.1998). When a litigant is facing a summary dismissal, we first accept the complaint's well-pleaded factual allegations as true, drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor, and then determine whether this reading of the complaint justifies recovery on any cognizable theory. Martin v. Applied Cellular Tech., Inc., 284 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.2002). Summary disposals \"should be used sparingly in complex antitrust litigation where motive and intent play leading roles, the proof is largely in the hands of alleged conspirators, and hostile witnesses thicken the plot.\" Poller v. Columbia Broad. Sys., Inc., 368 U.S. 464, 473 (1962).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two issues require discussion. First, we consider if the district court erred when it limited the interpretation of the phrase \"at prices which are substantially different\" to only those situations where a supplier offers its product at a substantially lower price to Puerto Rican customers as opposed to non-Puerto Rican customers, and ruled out those situations where a supplier charged the Puerto Rican company substantially more than a non-Puerto Rican company. Second, we decide if DJM's complaint alleges sufficient facts to establish a &#167; 264 claim, including whether the complaint at least inferentially asserts that (1) Tex-Shield's alleged conduct is aimed at \"destroying competition or eliminating a competitor located in Puerto Rico\"; and (2) the goods at issue are of the same grade or quality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Statutory Interpretation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither this circuit nor the Puerto Rican commonwealth courts have determined the pricing behaviors covered by &#167; 264. DJM contends that the statute prohibits charging either less or more for goods in Puerto Rico. Thus, DJM argues that the district court erred when it viewed the statute as an anti-dumping statute that prohibits only the charging of lower prices in Puerto Rico. Finally, DJM argues that &#167; 264 is clear on its face and that we should thus refrain from examining its legislative history. We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where the statute's language is clear, and its terms do not lead to \"absurd or wholly impracticable consequences,\" the words used are generally taken as the final expression of the intended meaning. Caminetti v. United States, 242 U.S. 470, 490 (1917); see also United States v. Mo. Pac. R.R., 278 U.S. 269, 277-78 (1929) (\"where no ambiguity exists, there is no room for construction\"). Although different canons of statutory construction may apply when construing statutes in a civil code system as opposed to statutes in a common law system, we need not concern ourselves with these differences because the Puerto Rico legislature provides a clear command as to the first step of civil code interpretation: \"When a law is clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of the same shall not be disregarded, under the pretext of fulfilling the spirit thereof.\" 31 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 14 (1967 &amp; Supp. 1989); see also Pritzker v. Yari, 42 F.3d 53, 66-67 (1st Cir.1994) (declining to \"wander beyond the four corners\" of a Puerto Rican statute to discern \"legislative intent\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the statute is clear regarding the pricing behavior it targets. Section 264 states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It shall be unlawful to sell, contract to sell, offer to sell, or participate in any step for the sale of articles in Puerto Rico, after making due allowance for differences in costs incident to the delivering of goods in Puerto Rico and the costs of handling such goods in Puerto Rico, at prices which are substantially different from prices charged or quoted by such sellers for goods of the same grade or quality to buyers located outside of Puerto Rico, when such difference in price is granted with the purpose of destroying competition or eliminating a competitor located in Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">10 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 264 (emphasis added). Unlike the Federal Anti-Dumping Act of 1916, which the district court adopted as the definitive model for this statute, there is no specific prohibition against charging \"a price substantially less\" in Puerto Rico &#8212; instead the legislature chose the broader term \"substantially different,\" which covers both higher and lower pricing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we hold the statutory language embraces both higher and lower prices on its face, we need not enter the quagmire of legislative history or use other tools of construction. The district court judge erred in interpreting the provision too narrowly, and that interpretation is reversed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. Sufficiency of Factual Allegations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having decided the statute includes both higher and lower price discrimination, we consider whether the complaint's allegations and any logical inferences therefrom \"justify recovery on any cognizable theory.\" Martin, 284 F.3d at 6. Here, DJM claims that the prices Tex-Shield charged to Creative Apparel were lower than those quoted to DJM plainly suffice to survive dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the statute applies to the alleged charging of higher prices in Puerto Rico, there are still two possible obstacles to stating a claim under &#167; 264. First, &#167; 264 prohibits a supplier from charging different prices for the purpose of destroying the supplier's \"competition or eliminating a competitor located in Puerto Rico.\" Second, &#167; 264 requires that the goods be of \"the same grade and quality.\" The district court did not address either issue; taking all inferences in DJM's favor, we find the district court erred in dismissing the complaint.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>1. Adverse Impact on Competition or Competitor</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A well-pleaded &#167; 264 claim must include allegations that the price discrimination was for \"the purpose of destroying competition or eliminating a competitor located in Puerto Rico.\" In its complaint, DJM contends that Tex-Shield and Creative Apparel entered into \"an agreement\" involving, among other things, investment by Tex-Shield in Creative Apparel as part of a joint strategy to secure and maintain for the Blucher defendants monopoly power in United States trade and commerce in Chemical Protective Cloth ... and to attempt to secure and maintain, and to secure and maintain, monopoly power for Creative [Apparel] in United States trade and commerce in Chemical Protective Clothing, as well as in such trade and commerce in the &#167; 8(a) market.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not irrational for a monopoly-holder such as Tex-Shield to act with the intent of sabotaging one of its two customers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Such a concerted effort to establish and maintain monopoly power in the relevant markets, if proven, would meet &#167; 264's purpose requirement because it would constitute an intent to harm competition in the chemical protective clothing market or eliminate DJM as Creative Apparel's competitor; thus, DJM's pleadings on this count suffice to meet &#167; 264's intent requirement. Compare In re Compact Disc Minimum Advertised Price Antitrust Litig., 138 F. Supp.2d 25, 28 n. 4 (D.Me. 2001) (denying motion to dismiss where it was \"not irrational or implausible to infer agreement from the facts alleged\"), with DM Research, Inc. v. Coll. of Am. Pathologists, 170 F.3d 53, 55-56 (1st Cir.1999) (affirming dismissal where complaint \"merely assert[ed] a conspiracy in conclusory terms\" and stating that allegation of some fact pertaining to an agreement would be necessary to overcome the improbability of a conspiracy against the interests of one or more of the parties).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">2. Goods of Same Grade and Quality</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, &#167; 264 requires that DJM allege that Tex-Shield was quoting different prices for \"goods of the same grade or quality.\" Defendants argue that \"the goods for which DJM requested a price &#8212; pre-cut fabric kits &#8212; were not the same grade or quality as the goods on which Creative Apparel requested a price &#8212; uncut cloth on the roll.\" Although this argument may ultimately have merit, it does not preclude inferences from the complaint sufficient to defeat a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is possible to infer from the complaint that the goods at issue were of the same grade and quality. According to the complaint, a DPSC report indicates that \"Defendant Tex-shield had, in fact, offered the Blucher Chemical Protective Cloth to Creative at a significantly lower price than it had offered the cloth to DJM.\" Given that the final product, the chemical protective clothing, had to be produced according to military specifications that included use of the Cloth, it is a reasonable inference &#8212; without considering any contrary proof &#8212; that the goods at issue (the Cloth) had to be of the same grade and quality.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Cf. Arruda v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 310 F.3d 13, 18 (1st Cir.2002) (indicating that in evaluating propriety of 12(b)(6) motion, the court must \"assume the truth of all well-pleaded facts and indulge all reasonable inferences therefrom that fit the plaintiff's stated theory of liability\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court's dismissal of the complaint is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We intimate no view as to whether, after pretrial discovery, trial-worthy issues will be shown to exist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The plaintiffs also alleged violations of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1 and 2, Sections 2(a), (e), and (f) of the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 13(a), (e), (f), the Puerto Rican statute dealing with price discrimination, 10 L.P.R.A. &#167; 263, and the Puerto Rican statute dealing with transactions in restraint of trade, 10 L.P.R.A. &#167; 258. The district court's decision is unchallenged with respect to these other claims</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Tex-Shield is wholly-owned by Blucher USA, which in turn is wholly-owned by Blucher GmbH. Creative Apparel is, like DJM, a clothing and equipage manufacturer. Tex-Shield, the Cloth's sole supplier, also makes finished chemical and biological protective clothing</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The Federal Anti-Dumping Act reads in pertinent part:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">It shall be unlawful for any person importing or assisting in importing any articles from any foreign country into the United States, commonly and systematically to import, sell or cause to be imported or sold such articles within the United States at a price substantially less than the actual market value or wholesale price of such articles, at the time of exportation to the United States, in the principal markets of the country of their production, or of other foreign countries to which they are commonly exported after adding to such market value or wholesale price, freight, duty, and other charges and expenses necessarily incident to the importation and sale thereof in the United States: Provided, That such act or acts be done with the intent of destroying or injuring an industry in the United States, or of preventing the establishment of an industry in the United States, or of restraining or monopolizing any part of trade and commerce in such articles in the United States.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">15 U.S.C. &#167; 72 (2003) (emphasis added). Clearly, the Puerto Rican legislature did not merely adopt the provision wholesale, but rather changed significant portions of it.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> This is not a case in which the district court converted the 12(b)(6) motion into a motion for summary judgment</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Both the allegation that Tex-Shield is building \"additional manufacturing operations\" near Creative Apparel's plant and the claim that Tex-Shield is investing in Creative Apparel to \"enhance its financial condition\" could, if proven, support a finding of an anti-competitive purpose to the price differential. Both of these facts suggest a special relationship between Tex-Shield and Creative Apparel that would make it logical for them to conspire to destroy competition in the chemical protective clothing market</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> We find the defendant's reliance on Lubbock Glass &amp; Mirror Co. v. Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co., 313 F. Supp. 1184, 1187 (N.D.Tex. 1970), unfounded. In Lubbock Glass, the court found that glass, doors, frames and windows could not be considered of like kind and quality when conveyed in different contracting jobs, because \"intangible items, such as installation, weather conditions, the architect or contractor in charge of the job and other intangibles make each job unique or different.\" Id. at 1185. Further the court stated that commercial installed contracts ... are a combination of many ingredients, none of which are subject to exact calculation. A difference in one ingredient could and probably would occasion a difference in the total price or bid. Apparently, someone calculating a bid for a commercial installed contract cannot even determine exactly the material costs involved</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 1186-87. The Cloth needed by both DJM and Creative is the same and the costs involved are easily estimated, as shown by DJM's own calculation of cutting costs.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Also, the solicitation required the suits be made with the Cloth; again, Tex-Shield was identified as the Cloth's sole approved source.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In preparing its bid for DPSC, DJM inquired as to the cost of procuring the Cloth. Tex-Shield quoted DJM a price of $38.71 per yard for the first 100,000 suits, and $41.07 per yard for any additional yardage. Tex-Shield quoted DJM a price of $148.95 for the first 100,000 suits in pre-cut \"kits\" and $154.43 per kit for any extra kits. Based on these quotes, DJM offered DPSC a price of $186.62 per unit for the first 100,000 suits and $183.50 for any more suits. Creative Apparel bid $179.55 for the first 100,000 suits and $186.02 for any extra. Creative won the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DJM filed a complaint against Tex-Shield, Blucher USA, Blucher GmbH, and Creative Apparel,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> alleging several federal and state antitrust violations. The complaint included allegations that Tex-Shield violated &#167; 264 of the Puerto Rico Anti-Monopoly Act by selling goods in Puerto Rico at prices different from the articles' price when sold elsewhere.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court dismissed all of the consolidated actions, including the &#167; 264 count, for failure to state a cause of action. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). In dismissing the &#167; 264 count, the district court read the section only as an anti-dumping statute, forbidding the sale of goods at lower prices in Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DJM appeals only the lower court's dismissal of the &#167; 264 count, as DJM waived all other appealable errors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's resolution of Tex-Shield's motion to dismiss de novo.

When a litigant is facing a summary dismissal, we first accept the complaint's well-pleaded factual allegations as true, drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor, and then determine whether this reading of the complaint justifies recovery on any cognizable theory.

Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two issues require discussion. First, we consider if the district court erred when it limited the interpretation of the phrase \"at prices which are substantially different\" to only those situations where a supplier offers its product at a substantially lower price to Puerto Rican customers as opposed to non-Puerto Rican customers, and ruled out those situations where a supplier charged the Puerto Rican company substantially more than a non-Puerto Rican company. Second, we decide if DJM's complaint alleges sufficient facts to establish a &#167; 264 claim, including whether the complaint at least inferentially asserts that (1) Tex-Shield's alleged conduct is aimed at \"destroying competition or eliminating a competitor located in Puerto Rico\"; and (2) the goods at issue are of the same grade or quality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Statutory Interpretation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither this circuit nor the Puerto Rican commonwealth courts have determined the pricing behaviors covered by &#167; 264. DJM contends that the statute prohibits charging either less or more for goods in Puerto Rico. Thus, DJM argues that the district court erred when it viewed the statute as an anti-dumping statute that prohibits only the charging of lower prices in Puerto Rico. Finally, DJM argues that &#167; 264 is clear on its face and that we should thus refrain from examining its legislative history. We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where the statute's language is clear, and its terms do not lead to \"absurd or wholly impracticable consequences,\" the words used are generally taken as the final expression of the intended meaning. Caminetti v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"98854\"><a href=\"/opinion/98854/caminetti-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">242</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">470</span></a></span>, 490 (1917); see also United States v. Mo. Pac. R.R., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101361\"><a href=\"/opinion/101361/united-states-v-missouri-pacific-r-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">278</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">269</span></a></span>, 277-78 (1929) (\"where no ambiguity exists, there is no room for construction\"). Although different canons of statutory construction may apply when construing statutes in a civil code system as opposed to statutes in a common law system, we need not concern ourselves with these differences because the Puerto Rico legislature provides a clear command as to the first step of civil code interpretation: \"When a law is clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of the same shall not be disregarded, under the pretext of fulfilling the spirit thereof.\" 31 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 14 (1967 &amp; Supp. 1989); see also Pritzker v. Yari, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"684076\"><a href=\"/opinion/684076/jay-a-pritzker-v-bob-yari/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span>, 66-67 (1st Cir.1994) (declining to \"wander beyond the four corners\" of a Puerto Rican statute to discern \"legislative intent\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the statute is clear regarding the pricing behavior it targets. Section 264 states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It shall be unlawful to sell, contract to sell, offer to sell, or participate in any step for the sale of articles in Puerto Rico, after making due allowance for differences in costs incident to the delivering of goods in Puerto Rico and the costs of handling such goods in Puerto Rico, at prices which are substantially different from prices charged or quoted by such sellers for goods of the same grade or quality to buyers located outside of Puerto Rico, when such difference in price is granted with the purpose of destroying competition or eliminating a competitor located in Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">10 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 264 (emphasis added). Unlike the Federal Anti-Dumping Act of 1916, which the district court adopted as the definitive model for this statute, there is no specific prohibition against charging \"a price substantially less\" in Puerto Rico &#8212; instead the legislature chose the broader term \"substantially different,\" which covers both higher and lower pricing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we hold the statutory language embraces both higher and lower prices on its face, we need not enter the quagmire of legislative history or use other tools of construction. The district court judge erred in interpreting the provision too narrowly, and that interpretation is reversed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. Sufficiency of Factual Allegations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having decided the statute includes both higher and lower price discrimination, we consider whether the complaint's allegations and any logical inferences therefrom \"justify recovery on any cognizable theory.\" Martin, 284 F.3d at 6. Here, DJM claims that the prices Tex-Shield charged to Creative Apparel were lower than those quoted to DJM plainly suffice to survive dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the statute applies to the alleged charging of higher prices in Puerto Rico, there are still two possible obstacles to stating a claim under &#167; 264. First, &#167; 264 prohibits a supplier from charging different prices for the purpose of destroying the supplier's \"competition or eliminating a competitor located in Puerto Rico.\" Second, &#167; 264 requires that the goods be of \"the same grade and quality.\" The district court did not address either issue; taking all inferences in DJM's favor, we find the district court erred in dismissing the complaint.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>1. Adverse Impact on Competition or Competitor</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A well-pleaded &#167; 264 claim must include allegations that the price discrimination was for \"the purpose of destroying competition or eliminating a competitor located in Puerto Rico.\" In its complaint, DJM contends that Tex-Shield and Creative Apparel entered into \"an agreement\" involving, among other things, investment by Tex-Shield in Creative Apparel as part of a joint strategy to secure and maintain for the Blucher defendants monopoly power in United States trade and commerce in Chemical Protective Cloth ... and to attempt to secure and maintain, and to secure and maintain, monopoly power for Creative [Apparel] in United States trade and commerce in Chemical Protective Clothing, as well as in such trade and commerce in the &#167; 8(a) market.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not irrational for a monopoly-holder such as Tex-Shield to act with the intent of sabotaging one of its two customers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Such a concerted effort to establish and maintain monopoly power in the relevant markets, if proven, would meet &#167; 264's purpose requirement because it would constitute an intent to harm competition in the chemical protective clothing market or eliminate DJM as Creative Apparel's competitor; thus, DJM's pleadings on this count suffice to meet &#167; 264's intent requirement. Compare In re Compact Disc Minimum Advertised Price Antitrust Litig., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2462110\"><a href=\"/opinion/2462110/in-re-compact-disc-minimum-adver-price-anti-lit/\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 28 n. 4 (D.Me. 2001) (denying motion to dismiss where it was \"not irrational or implausible to infer agreement from the facts alleged\"), with DM Research, Inc. v. Coll. of Am. Pathologists, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198356\"><a href=\"/opinion/198356/dm-research-etc-v-college-of-american/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span>, 55-56 (1st Cir.1999) (affirming dismissal where complaint \"merely assert[ed] a conspiracy in conclusory terms\" and stating that allegation of some fact pertaining to an agreement would be necessary to overcome the improbability of a conspiracy against the interests of one or more of the parties).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">2. Goods of Same Grade and Quality</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, &#167; 264 requires that DJM allege that Tex-Shield was quoting different prices for \"goods of the same grade or quality.\" Defendants argue that \"the goods for which DJM requested a price &#8212; pre-cut fabric kits &#8212; were not the same grade or quality as the goods on which Creative Apparel requested a price &#8212; uncut cloth on the roll.\" Although this argument may ultimately have merit, it does not preclude inferences from the complaint sufficient to defeat a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is possible to infer from the complaint that the goods at issue were of the same grade and quality. According to the complaint, a DPSC report indicates that \"Defendant Tex-shield had, in fact, offered the Blucher Chemical Protective Cloth to Creative at a significantly lower price than it had offered the cloth to DJM.\" Given that the final product, the chemical protective clothing, had to be produced according to military specifications that included use of the Cloth, it is a reasonable inference &#8212; without considering any contrary proof &#8212; that the goods at issue (the Cloth) had to be of the same grade and quality.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Cf. Arruda v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200185\"><a href=\"/opinion/200185/arruda-v-degrenier/\"><span class=\"volume\">310</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 18 (1st Cir.2002) (indicating that in evaluating propriety of 12(b)(6) motion, the court must \"assume the truth of all well-pleaded facts and indulge all reasonable inferences therefrom that fit the plaintiff's stated theory of liability\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court's dismissal of the complaint is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We intimate no view as to whether, after pretrial discovery, trial-worthy issues will be shown to exist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The plaintiffs also alleged violations of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1 and 2, Sections 2(a), (e), and (f) of the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 13(a), (e), (f), the Puerto Rican statute dealing with price discrimination, 10 L.P.R.A. &#167; 263, and the Puerto Rican statute dealing with transactions in restraint of trade, 10 L.P.R.A. &#167; 258. The district court's decision is unchallenged with respect to these other claims</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Tex-Shield is wholly-owned by Blucher USA, which in turn is wholly-owned by Blucher GmbH. Creative Apparel is, like DJM, a clothing and equipage manufacturer. Tex-Shield, the Cloth's sole supplier, also makes finished chemical and biological protective clothing</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The Federal Anti-Dumping Act reads in pertinent part:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">It shall be unlawful for any person importing or assisting in importing any articles from any foreign country into the United States, commonly and systematically to import, sell or cause to be imported or sold such articles within the United States at a price substantially less than the actual market value or wholesale price of such articles, at the time of exportation to the United States, in the principal markets of the country of their production, or of other foreign countries to which they are commonly exported after adding to such market value or wholesale price, freight, duty, and other charges and expenses necessarily incident to the importation and sale thereof in the United States: Provided, That such act or acts be done with the intent of destroying or injuring an industry in the United States, or of preventing the establishment of an industry in the United States, or of restraining or monopolizing any part of trade and commerce in such articles in the United States.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">15 U.S.C. &#167; 72 (2003) (emphasis added). Clearly, the Puerto Rican legislature did not merely adopt the provision wholesale, but rather changed significant portions of it.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> This is not a case in which the district court converted the 12(b)(6) motion into a motion for summary judgment</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Both the allegation that Tex-Shield is building \"additional manufacturing operations\" near Creative Apparel's plant and the claim that Tex-Shield is investing in Creative Apparel to \"enhance its financial condition\" could, if proven, support a finding of an anti-competitive purpose to the price differential. Both of these facts suggest a special relationship between Tex-Shield and Creative Apparel that would make it logical for them to conspire to destroy competition in the chemical protective clothing market</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> We find the defendant's reliance on Lubbock Glass &amp; Mirror Co. v. Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">313</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1184</span></span>, 1187 (N.D.Tex. 1970), unfounded. In Lubbock Glass, the court found that glass, doors, frames and windows could not be considered of like kind and quality when conveyed in different contracting jobs, because \"intangible items, such as installation, weather conditions, the architect or contractor in charge of the job and other intangibles make each job unique or different.\" Id. at 1185. Further the court stated that commercial installed contracts ... are a combination of many ingredients, none of which are subject to exact calculation. A difference in one ingredient could and probably would occasion a difference in the total price or bid. Apparently, someone calculating a bid for a commercial installed contract cannot even determine exactly the material costs involved</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 1186-87. The Cloth needed by both DJM and Creative is the same and the costs involved are easily estimated, as shown by DJM's own calculation of cutting costs.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
