During his sentencing hearing for\n\nillegally reentering the United States after deportation, defendant\n\nJuan Eduardo         Mejia    argued   that    he    should    receive      a   downward\n\ndeparture       from   the    sentence   prescribed       in   the     United     States\n\nSentencing         Commission    Guidelines     (the     Sentencing         Guidelines)\n\nbecause his motivation for returning, namely, to care for his\n\ndaughter, took him out of the \"heartland\" of illegal reentry\n\ndefendants.1        The district court denied his motion for a downward\n\ndeparture based in part on its belief that it had no authority to\n\nconsider       a   defendant's    motive      for    returning    as    a    basis   for\n\ndeparture.\n\n               Mejia appeals this legal determination, arguing that the\n\ndistrict court erred in its conclusion that it had no authority to\n\nconsider a downward departure based on a defendant's atypical\n\nmotivation in returning to the United States.                    Finding that, in\n\nthis       case,    Mejia's     \"motivation\"        argument    for    departure      is\n\nsemantically and practically equivalent to the specific offender\n\n\n\n       1\n           The Introduction to the Sentencing Guidelines explains:\n\n       The Commission intends the sentencing courts to treat\n       each guideline as carving out a \"heartland,\" a set of\n       typical cases embodying the conduct that each guideline\n       describes. When a court finds an atypical case, one to\n       which a particular guideline linguistically applies but\n       where conduct significantly differs from the norm, the\n       court may consider whether a departure is warranted.\n\nUnited States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual, Ch. 1,\nPt. A, intro. comment. 4(b)(Nov. 2001).\n\n                                         -2-\n\fcharacteristic of \"family ties and responsibilities\" set forth in\n\nthe Sentencing Guidelines, USSG § 5H1.6, we affirm the district\n\ncourt's denial of a downward departure without addressing the legal\n\ncorrectness of the district court's conclusion that motivation is\n\nan impermissible basis for departure.\n\n                                     I.\n\n           We recite the facts as Mejia alleges them to be.            Mejia\n\nfirst came to the United States in 1988, living briefly with his\n\nfather in Boston before moving to New Bedford, where he met Melissa\n\nDesroches.     During the course of their one-year relationship,\n\nDesroches and Mejia had a child: Adria Mejia-Desroches.            At the\n\nrelevant time, Adria resided with and was raised by her maternal\n\ngrandmother, Gwen Andrade and Andrade's husband, on Cape Cod.            Her\n\nmother played no role in her upbringing due to drug dependency and\n\nrelated problems, and her grandparents have legal custody.\n\n             Before his 1992 arrest for drug trafficking, possession\n\nof a firearm and assault with a dangerous weapon, Mejia lived in\n\nHyannis,     Massachusetts,   near        his   daughter.     During     his\n\nincarceration following conviction for these offenses, and later\n\nwhen living in the Dominican Republic after his deportation on\n\nFebruary 9, 1995, Mejia kept in contact with his daughter.                In\n\nAugust 2000, Mejia received news that Gwen Andrade was ill and was\n\nnot expected to live much longer.         Mejia asserts that it was out of\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fconcern for his daughter's well-being that he decided to leave the\n\nDominican Republic and return to Massachusetts.\n\n           After his return to the United States, Mejia lived with\n\na girlfriend in Mattapan, MA and earned approximately $600-$700 per\n\nweek working for a cable company in New Hampshire.      While he did\n\nnot provide financial support to Andrade for the care of Adria, he\n\ndid provide certain necessities and gifts for Adria when he had the\n\nmoney.    During this time Mejia would visit Adria, and Andrade\n\nallowed Adria to be with her father on overnight visits.\n\n           On January 29, 2001, Mejia was arrested in Boston on\n\ncharges of distributing cocaine, and subsequently convicted on May\n\n18, 2001, in South Boston District Court and sentenced to time\n\nserved.    He was immediately taken into federal custody on an\n\noutstanding    arrest   warrant   for   illegal   reentry   following\n\ndeportation.\n\n           Pursuant to a plea agreement with the government, Mejia\n\npled guilty on September 14, 2001, to one count of illegally\n\nreentering the United States after deportation in violation of 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1326(a)(b)(2) (2000).     Before sentencing, Mejia filed a\n\nmotion requesting a downward departure because his reentry into the\n\nUnited States was \"based on his extraordinary family ties and\n\nresponsibilities with respect to his young daughter.\"         At the\n\nsentencing hearing Mejia, relying on United States v. Lipman, 133\n\nF.3d 726 (9th Cir. 1997), revised his motion for a downward\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fdeparture, asserting instead that his motivation for returning to\n\nthe United States took him out of the heartland of reentry cases.\n\nMejia's counsel argued that the \"archetype of illegal reentry\n\noffenders which Congress targeted for severe punishment\" are those\n\nwho return to the United States for unlawful or pecuniary reasons.\n\nThus, because Mejia's motivation for returning was concern for his\n\ndaughter, he fell outside the heartland of the offense of illegal\n\nreentry.   The district court denied the motion, concluding that it\n\ndid not have the authority to depart from the Sentencing Guidelines\n\non the basis of motivation as a factor standing alone, and that, in\n\nlight of Andrade's husband's plans to retain custody of Adria,\n\nMejia's situation was insufficiently extraordinary to meet the\n\nrequirements of a downward departure based on the \"family ties and\n\nresponsibilities\" factor.   USSG § 5H1.6.\n\n           Applying the Sentencing Guidelines, the district court\n\ndetermined that Mejia had a base offense level of 8.       However,\n\nMejia had been deported after having been sentenced to 4-5 years on\n\na 1992 conviction for drug trafficking, and was therefore subject\n\nto a 16-level increase for a defendant who was previously deported\n\nafter a conviction for certain specified felonies, including drug\n\ntrafficking offenses for which the sentence imposed exceeded 13\n\nmonths.    USSG § 2L1.2(b)(1)(A).     The district court calculated\n\nMejia's adjusted offense level to be 24, bringing his total offense\n\nlevel, after the 3-level downward adjustment for acceptance of\n\n\n                                -5-\n\fresponsibility, to 21.     On December 14, 2001, Mejia was sentenced\n\nto 46 months' imprisonment and 2 years' supervised release.\n\n                                   II.\n\n          The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 allows a defendant to\n\nappeal an upward departure and the government to appeal a downward\n\ndeparture. 18 U.S.C. § 3742(a)(3), (b)(3) (2000). A defendant can\n\nalso appeal from the refusal of the district court to grant a\n\ndownward departure if the district court bases its decision on a\n\nview that it lacks the legal authority to consider a departure.\n\nUnited States v. Ahlers, No. 01-2570, slip op. at 6 (1st Cir. Sept.\n\n30, 2002)(\"Appellate jurisdiction from a denial of a departure\n\nrequest attaches when the sentencing court bases its action on a\n\nperception   that   it   lacks   the   legal   authority   to   grant   the\n\nrequest.\"); United States v. Woodward, 277 F.3d 87, 92-93 (1st Cir.\n\n2002)(\"[A] refusal to depart is unreviewable unless the district\n\ncourt based its decision on an error of law.\")(quoting United\n\nStates v. Dewire, 271 F.3d 333, 337-38 (1st Cir. 2001)); see also\n\nUnited States v. Pierro, 32 F.3d 611, 619 (1st Cir. 1994)(\"It is by\n\nnow axiomatic that a criminal defendant cannot ground an appeal on\n\na sentencing court's discretionary decision not to depart below the\n\nguideline sentencing range.\").         Accordingly, we review de novo a\n\ndistrict court's determination of its authority to depart, but lack\n\njurisdiction to review a discretionary decision not to depart from\n\nthe Sentencing Guidelines.\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\f                                           III.\n\n               At    Mejia's   sentencing         hearing,   the    district   court\n\ndeclined to depart from the Sentencing Guidelines on two grounds.\n\nFirst, the court concluded that motive is not a permitted factor\n\nfor departure: \"I do not think...that I have authority to depart.\n\nI do not think that motive, whatever the motive in this case for\n\ncoming back to see his daughter, is a ground for departure.\"\n\nSecond, the court determined that the facts of Mejia's case were\n\nnot sufficiently extraordinary to meet the standard for a departure\n\nbased     on    the    \"family      ties    and     responsibilities\"      offender\n\ncharacteristic.\n\n               The Sentencing Guidelines establish ranges of criminal\n\nsentences for federal offenses and offenders.                      A district court\n\nmust impose a sentence within the applicable Guideline range if it\n\nfinds the case to be a typical one.                 However, in an \"exceptional\"\n\ncase, a district court may depart from the Guideline range \"if [it]\n\nfinds that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance\n\nof a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration\n\nby the Sentencing Commission.\"               18 U.S.C. § 1553(a) (2000); see\n\nalso Koon v. United States, 518 U.S. 81, 95 (1996); United States\n\nv. Pereira, 272 F. 3d 76, 80 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n               The    Sentencing     Commission        lists   certain     offender\n\ncharacteristics that can never be grounds for departure, and other\n\nfactors    that      are   either   encouraged       or   discouraged    bases   for\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\fdeparture.       The Sentencing Commission lists \"family ties and\n\nresponsibilities\" as a discouraged factor, and stipulates that\n\n\"[f]amily ties and responsibilities and community ties are not\n\nordinarily relevant in determining whether a sentence should be\n\noutside    the    applicable        guideline    range.\"        USSG      §   5H1.6.\n\nUnmentioned offender characteristics that are \"the semantic or\n\npractical equivalents\" of encouraged or discouraged characteristics\n\nshould    be    examined     within    the     structure   of   the       Sentencing\n\nGuidelines.      Koon, 518 U.S. at 110.              \"To hold otherwise would\n\nenable defendants to circumvent the entire Guideline structure by\n\ncleverly characterizing discouraged factors in such a way as to\n\nappear as--and be treated under the more lenient standard of--\n\nunmentioned factors.\"2        United States v. Bogdan, 284 F.3d 324, 329\n\n(1st Cir. 2002); see also United States v. Romero, 32 F.3d 641, 653\n\n(1st Cir.1994) (treating defendant's status as a father under the\n\ncategory   of    \"family     ties     and    responsibilities,\"       despite   his\n\nargument that      such     status    should    be   examined   as    a   separate,\n\nunmentioned      factor).\n\n\n\n     2\n      A court may decide to depart from the Sentencing Guidelines\nin reliance on a factor not specifically enumerated in the\nGuidelines. \"If a factor is unmentioned in the Guidelines, the\ncourt must, after considering the structure and theory of both\nrelevant individual guidelines and the Guidelines taken as a whole,\ndecide whether it is sufficient to take the case out of the\nGuideline's heartland.\" Koon, 518 U.S. at 96 (internal citations\nomitted). As we said in Bogdan, this analytical framework for\nunmentioned factors, as exposited in Koon, is less demanding than\nthe requirement of \"exceptionality\" for discouraged factors.\n\n                                        -8-\n\f           Arguing that his motivation for committing the offense of\n\nunlawful   reentry   is   a    factor    not     explicitly    listed    by    the\n\nCommission as encouraged or discouraged, Mejia challenges the\n\ndistrict court's determination that motivation is not a permissible\n\nunmentioned ground for departure.              However, the claim that his\n\nrelationship with his daughter and his responsibility as a parent\n\nwere factors in the commission of the offense and should therefore\n\nmitigate his punishment is not meaningfully distinguishable from\n\nthe argument that his sentence should be reduced due to his\n\nexceptional family ties and responsibilities.\n\n           Defendants     usually       invoke     the     \"family    ties     and\n\nresponsibilities\" extant at the time of sentencing in arguing for\n\na downward departure (that is, they argue the consequences of a\n\nsentence on their family ties and responsibilities).                  Here, with\n\nhis   motivation   argument,    Mejia     invokes    the    \"family     ties   and\n\nresponsibilities\" extant at the time he committed the crime to\n\nlessen his culpability for the crime of illegal reentry.                However,\n\nthere is nothing in the text of USSG § 5H1.6 stipulating that\n\n\"family ties and responsibilities\" is only a discouraged factor in\n\nassessing the consequences of a sentence and not in assessing the\n\nculpability for a crime. Thus, we find that Mejia's claim, however\n\nhe wishes to characterize it, is inescapably based on factors\n\nexplicitly accounted for in the Sentencing Guidelines, namely,\n\n\"family ties and responsibilities,\" and do not reach the question\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fof whether motivation as a separate category is ever a permissible\n\nground for departure.\n\n          The district court determined that the facts of Mejia's\n\nfamily ties and responsibilities are not sufficiently exceptional\n\nto warrant a departure on this ground.   Because the district court\n\ndid not misunderstand its legal authority to depart downward, but\n\nmerely exercised its discretion not to do so, we lack jurisdiction\n\nto review the court's refusal to grant a departure.\n\n          Accordingly, the sentence imposed by the district court\n\nis affirmed.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                              -10-\n\f",

Mejia first came to the United States in 1988, living briefly with his father in Boston before moving to New Bedford, where he met Melissa Desroches. During the course of their one-year relationship, Desroches and Mejia had a child: Adria Mejia-Desroches. At the relevant time, Adria resided with and was raised by her maternal grandmother, Gwen Andrade and Andrade's husband, on Cape Cod.

During his incarceration following conviction for these offenses, and later when living in the Dominican Republic after his deportation on February 9, 1995, Mejia kept in contact with his daughter. In August 2000, Mejia received news that Gwen Andrade was ill and was not expected to live much longer.

Before sentencing, Mejia filed a motion requesting a downward departure because his reentry into the United States was \"based on his extraordinary family ties and responsibilities with respect to his young daughter.\" At the sentencing hearing Mejia, relying on <i>United States v. Lipman,</i> 133 F.3d 726 (9th Cir.1997), revised his motion for a downward departure, asserting instead that his motivation for returning to the United States took him out of the heartland of reentry cases. Mejia's counsel argued that the \"archetype of illegal reentry offenders which Congress targeted for severe punishment\" are those who return to the United States for unlawful or pecuniary reasons. Thus, because Mejia's motivation for returning was concern for his daughter, he fell outside the heartland of the offense of illegal reentry. The district court denied the motion, concluding that it did not have the authority to depart from the Sentencing Guidelines on the basis of motivation as a factor standing alone, and that, in light of Andrade's husband's plans to retain custody of Adria, Mejia's situation was insufficiently extraordinary to meet the requirements of a downward departure based on the \"family ties and responsibilities\" factor.

USSG &#167; 2L1.2(b)(1)(A). The district court calculated Mejia's adjusted offense level to be 24, bringing his total offense level, after the 3-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, to 21.

Finding that, in this case, Mejia's \"motivation\" argument for departure is semantically and practically equivalent to the specific offender characteristic of \"family ties and responsibilities\" set forth in the Sentencing Guidelines, USSG &#167; 5H1.6, we affirm the district court's denial of a downward departure without addressing the legal correctness of the district court's conclusion that motivation is an impermissible basis for departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recite the facts as Mejia alleges them to be. Mejia first came to the United States in 1988, living briefly with his father in Boston before moving to New Bedford, where he met Melissa Desroches. During the course of their one-year relationship, Desroches and Mejia had a child: Adria Mejia-Desroches. At the relevant time, Adria resided with and was raised by her maternal grandmother, Gwen Andrade and Andrade's husband, on Cape Cod. Her mother played no role in her upbringing due to drug dependency and related problems, and her grandparents have legal custody.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before his 1992 arrest for drug trafficking, possession of a firearm and assault with a dangerous weapon, Mejia lived in Hyannis, Massachusetts, near his daughter. During his incarceration following conviction for these offenses, and later when living in the Dominican Republic after his deportation on February 9, 1995, Mejia kept in contact with his daughter. In August 2000, Mejia received news that Gwen Andrade was ill and was not expected to live much longer. Mejia asserts that it was out of concern for his daughter's well-being that he decided to leave the Dominican Republic and return to Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After his return to the United States, Mejia lived with a girlfriend in Mattapan, MA and earned approximately $600-$700 per week working for a cable company in New Hampshire. While he did not provide financial support to Andrade for the care of Adria, he did provide certain necessities and gifts for Adria when he had the money. During this time Mejia would visit Adria, and Andrade allowed Adria to be with her father on overnight visits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 29, 2001, Mejia was arrested in Boston on charges of distributing cocaine, and subsequently convicted on May 18, 2001, in South Boston District Court and sentenced to time served. He was immediately taken into federal custody on an outstanding arrest warrant for illegal reentry following deportation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to a plea agreement with the government, Mejia pled guilty on September 14, 2001, to one count of illegally reentering the United States after deportation in violation of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(a)(b)(2) (2000). Before sentencing, Mejia filed a motion requesting a downward departure because his reentry into the United States was \"based on his extraordinary family ties and responsibilities with respect to his young daughter.\" At the sentencing hearing Mejia, relying on <i>United States v. Lipman,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">726</span></span> (9th Cir.1997), revised his motion for a downward departure, asserting instead that his motivation for returning to the United States took him out of the heartland of reentry cases. Mejia's counsel argued that the \"archetype of illegal reentry offenders which Congress targeted for severe punishment\" are those who return to the United States for unlawful or pecuniary reasons. Thus, because Mejia's motivation for returning was concern for his daughter, he fell outside the heartland of the offense of illegal reentry. The district court denied the motion, concluding that it did not have the authority to depart from the Sentencing Guidelines on the basis of motivation as a factor standing alone, and that, in light of Andrade's husband's plans to retain custody of Adria, Mejia's situation was insufficiently extraordinary to meet the requirements of a downward departure based on the \"family ties and responsibilities\" factor. USSG &#167; 5H1.6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying the Sentencing Guidelines, the district court determined that Mejia had a base offense level of 8. However, Mejia had been deported after having been sentenced to 4-5 years on a 1992 conviction for drug trafficking, and was therefore subject to a 16-level increase for a defendant who was previously deported after a conviction for certain specified felonies, including drug trafficking offenses for which the sentence imposed exceeded 13 months. USSG &#167; 2L1.2(b)(1)(A). The district court calculated Mejia's adjusted offense level to be 24, bringing his total offense level, after the 3-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, to 21. On December 14, 2001, Mejia was sentenced to 46 months' imprisonment and 2 years' supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 allows a defendant to appeal an upward departure and the government to appeal a downward departure. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742(a)(3), (b)(3) (2000).
