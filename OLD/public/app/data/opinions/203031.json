This appeal has its genesis\n\nin a dramatic raid on a leather goods factory in New Bedford,\n\nMassachusetts.     Enforcement of the immigration laws is difficult\n\nand oftentimes controversial work.          So it was here: the raid led to\n\nthe   detention    of    hundreds     of    undocumented       aliens    and    put\n\nsignificant strains on those involved and those who wished to help.\n\nIn short order, the detainees (many of whom were whisked away to\n\ndistant places) brought a civil action alleging abridgement of a\n\nconstellation of constitutional and statutory rights.\n\n           Confronted with a maze of issues, the district court\n\npatiently sorted through them and, in a thoughtful rescript,\n\neventually   dismissed      the    action    for   want   of    subject      matter\n\njurisdiction. Aguilar v. U.S. Immigr. & Customs Enf. Div. of Dep't\n\nof Homeland Sec., 490 F. Supp. 2d 42, 48 (D. Mass. 2007).                      The\n\ndetainees (whom we sometimes shall refer to as \"the petitioners\")\n\nnow challenge that ukase.         Their appeal raises novel and important\n\nquestions concerning the scope, reach, and interpretation of the\n\nimmigration laws. In particular, it requires us to disentangle the\n\nGordian   knot    of    jurisdictional      provisions    created       by   recent\n\namendments to the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).\n\n             We discern no simple, one-size-fits-all answer to the\n\nquestions presented by the parties. After careful perscrutation of\n\na scumbled record, we conclude that some of the petitioners' claims\n\nare unpreserved, some are subject to a jurisdictional bar, and\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fothers are simply not actionable.         The common denominator is that\n\nnone of the claims can proceed in the district court.            Thus, while\n\nour reasoning differs somewhat from that of the court below — and\n\nour opinion should not be read as an unqualified endorsement of the\n\nway in which immigration officials handled the matter — we affirm\n\nthe judgment of dismissal.       The tale follows.\n\n                                     I.\n\n            We rehearse here only those facts needed to place this\n\nappeal in workable perspective. On March 6, 2007, federal officers\n\nconducted a raid as part of \"Operation United Front.\"                 The raid\n\ntargeted Michael Bianco, Inc., a Department of Defense contractor\n\nsuspected    of   employing      large    numbers     of   illegal     aliens.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, armed with search\n\nand arrest warrants, appeared unannounced at the factory, arrested\n\nfive executives on immigration-related criminal charges, and took\n\nmore than 300 rank-and-file employees into custody for civil\n\nimmigration infractions.      The ICE agents cast a wide net and paid\n\nlittle   attention    to   the     detainees'       individual   or     family\n\ncircumstances.\n\n            The   government's     subsequent   actions      regarding     the\n\nundocumented workers who were swept up in the net lie at the\n\nepicenter of this litigation.       After releasing dozens of employees\n\ndetermined either to be minors or to be legally residing in the\n\nUnited States, ICE transported the remaining detainees to Fort\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fDevens (a holding facility in Ayer, Massachusetts).                       Citing a\n\nshortage of available bed space in Massachusetts, ICE then began\n\ntransferring substantial numbers of aliens to faraway detention and\n\nremoval operations centers (DROs). For example, on March 7, 90\n\ndetainees were flown to a DRO in Harlingen, Texas, and the next day\n\n116 more were flown to a DRO in El Paso, Texas.\n\n              ICE    attempted     to   coordinate    its   maneuvers     with     the\n\nMassachusetts Department of Social Services (DSS) to ensure the\n\nproper care of family members.             It took steps to address concerns\n\nabout child welfare and released several detainees for humanitarian\n\nreasons. Still, the petitioners allege (and, for present purposes,\n\nwe accept) that ICE gave social welfare agencies insufficient\n\nnotice   of    the    raid,    that     caseworkers   were   denied      access     to\n\ndetainees until after the first group had been transferred, and\n\nthat   various       ICE    actions     temporarily   thwarted     any    effective\n\ninvestigation        into    the    detainees'   needs.       As   a     result,    a\n\nsubstantial number of the detainees' minor children were left for\n\nvarying periods of time without adult supervision.\n\n              With respect to the detainees themselves, the petitioners\n\naver that ICE inhibited their exercise of the right to counsel.\n\nAccording to the petitioners, a squad of volunteer lawyers who had\n\noffered to provide the detainees with guidance was turned away from\n\nFort Devens on March 7.            The next day, the lawyers were allowed to\n\nmeet with those detainees (some thirty in number) who had expressly\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\frequested      legal        advice.       The    petitioners       allege        that,\n\nnotwithstanding this largesse, some detainees were denied access to\n\ncounsel after they arrived in Texas.\n\n              On the afternoon of March 8, the Guatemalan consul,\n\nacting   as    next    friend    of   the   detainees    (many     of   whom     were\n\nGuatemalan nationals), filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus\n\nand a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in the United\n\nStates District Court for the District of Massachusetts.                           The\n\naction   sought       the    detainees'     immediate    release    or,     in    the\n\nalternative,      a    temporary      restraining     order    halting      further\n\ntransfers.     The district court enjoined ICE from moving any of the\n\nremaining detainees out of Massachusetts pending further order of\n\nthe court.\n\n              On March 13, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint,\n\nfashioned as a class action, and withdrew their plea for immediate\n\nrelease. The amended complaint named ICE and various other federal\n\nagencies and actors as respondents (for ease in exposition, we\n\nsometimes refer to the defendants, collectively, as \"ICE\" or \"the\n\ngovernment\"). In that pleading, the petitioners alleged that ICE's\n\nactions had violated certain of the petitioners' constitutional and\n\nstatutory     rights,       including:    (i)   the   right   to   be   free     from\n\narbitrary, prolonged, and indefinite detention; (ii) the right to\n\na prompt bond hearing, that is, one held in Massachusetts prior to\n\nany transfer; (iii) the right to counsel; and (iv) the right of\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\ffamily integrity.    The amended complaint further alleged that it\n\nwas \"the established policy and practice of the [government] to\n\nconduct large scale 'sweeps' or 'raids' in which large numbers of\n\npersons suspected of being unlawfully present in the United States\"\n\nare held \"at facilities which are some distance from the site of\n\narrest and under conditions where access to counsel . . . is\n\nimpracticable, if not impossible.\"\n\n            On March 16, the government filed an omnibus motion to\n\ndismiss for want of personal and subject matter jurisdiction and\n\nfor failure to state any claim upon which relief might be granted.\n\nIn due course, the district court allowed the motion to dismiss on\n\nthe ground that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction.            Aguilar,\n\n490 F. Supp. 2d at 48.       The court also dissolved the temporary\n\nrestraining order that it previously had issued.\n\n            The linchpin of the lower court's decision was its\n\nconclusion that the INA, as amended by the REAL ID Act of 2005,\n\nPub. L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231, 302, stripped it of both habeas\n\nand federal question jurisdiction to hear the petitioners' claims.\n\nAguilar, 490 F. Supp. 2d at 46, 48 (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9));\n\nid. at 47-48 (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii)).                 In its\n\nrescript,   the   court   rejected    the    petitioners'   attempted   re-\n\ncharacterization of their remonstrances as pattern and practice\n\nclaims, that is, claims alleging a collective denial of rights\n\ncollateral to removal proceedings.         Id. at 48.   In that regard, the\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fcourt concluded that the petitioners had failed to link these\n\nclass-wide    pattern     and   practice   claims     to   any   specific\n\nconstitutional violation that might be ripe for review.          Id.\n\n            The district court paid special heed to the absence of\n\nany Sixth Amendment right to counsel in removal proceedings, the\n\nabsence of any constitutional right to release on bond, and the\n\nabsence of any constitutional right to have a removal proceeding\n\nheld in a particular venue.     Id.   And while acknowledging that the\n\npetitioners were entitled to the due process guarantees of the\n\nFifth Amendment as well as to certain statutory protections, the\n\ndistrict court concluded that those rights were personal to the\n\npetitioners and, as such, had to be exhausted administratively\n\nbefore the courts could become involved.        Id.\n\n            This timely appeal ensued. In it, the petitioners assign\n\nerror to the lower court's conclusion that it lacked subject matter\n\njurisdiction over their claims and relatedly, to its conclusion\n\nthat the petitioners are only entitled to judicial review on an\n\nindividualized    basis    after   exhausting    their     administrative\n\nremedies.    Overall, the petitioners urge us to hold that they have\n\nstated cognizable claims that are ripe for judicial review and that\n\ntheir action should, therefore, be allowed to proceed in the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\f                                  II.\n\n            Conscious of our role as a court of limited jurisdiction,\n\nwe begin our analysis with the multi-part question of whether and\n\nto   what   extent   the   district    court    possessed    subject   matter\n\njurisdiction to hear the petitioners' claims.               See Steel Co. v.\n\nCitizens for a Better Env't, 523 U.S. 83, 88-89 (1998); Bell v.\n\nHood, 327 U.S. 678, 682 (1946).             We then turn to the surviving\n\nclaims.\n\n            We review a district court's dismissal for want of\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction de novo.           See, e.g., Dominion Energy\n\nBrayton Point, LLC v. Johnson, 443 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\nFor that purpose, we give weight to the well-pleaded factual\n\naverments in the operative pleading (here, the petitioners' amended\n\ncomplaint) and indulge every reasonable inference in the pleader's\n\nfavor.    See Muñiz-Rivera v. United States, 326 F.3d 8, 11 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).    Where, however, those facts are illuminated, supplemented,\n\nor even contradicted by other materials in the district court\n\nrecord, we need not confine our jurisdictional inquiry to the\n\npleadings, but may consider those other materials.1              See J.S. ex\n\n\n      1\n      This seems an appropriate place to mention that, before oral\nargument in this court, the government moved to supplement the\nrecord with copies of orders from immigration judges awarding\ncontinuances, changes of venue, and other ancillary relief to\nseveral of the petitioners.    We grant the motion.    Although we\ngenerally limit appellate consideration to the record before the\ndistrict court, this submission comes within an exception to the\nusual rule because we may take judicial notice of the proffered\norders. See, e.g., Fornalik v. Perryman, 223 F.3d 523, 529 (7th\n\n                                      -8-\n\frel. N.S. v. Attica Cent. Sch., 386 F.3d 107, 110 (2d Cir. 2004);\n\nGonzalez v. United States, 284 F.3d 281, 288 (1st Cir. 2002).   Our\n\nsolution to the jurisdictional puzzle may be original, that is, we\n\nmay affirm an order of dismissal on any ground made apparent by the\n\nrecord (whether or not relied upon by the lower court).         See\n\nInterGen N.V. v. Grina, 344 F.3d 134, 141 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n                                 A.\n\n           The petitioners contend that the district court possessed\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction over their claims pursuant to the\n\ngeneral grant of federal question jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 1331,\n\nand the statutory grant of habeas corpus jurisdiction, id. § 2241.\n\nIn outlining this contention, they concede that Congress, in\n\nenacting 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9), attempted to direct challenges to\n\nremoval through defined administrative channels.       They argue,\n\nhowever, that their claims lie beyond the reach of this channeling\n\nstatute.\n\n           Delineating the precise ambit of section 1252(b)(9) calls\n\nfor an exercise in statutory construction.      Thus, our starting\n\npoint is the statutory text.   See Richardson v. United States, 526\n\n\n\n\nCir. 2000) (taking judicial notice of INS actions); see also Fed.\nR. Evid. 201 advisory committee note (stating that judicial notice\nmay be taken on appeal). As we explain later in this opinion, the\norders are highly relevant to a determination of whether the\npetitioners have an adequate forum in which to present their\nclaims.\n\n                                -9-\n\fU.S. 813, 816 (1999); Fed. Refin. Co. v. Klock, 352 F.3d 16, 25\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).\n\n             Section   1252(b)(9)    is        entitled   \"Consolidation   of\n\nquestions for judicial review.\"        It reads in pertinent part:\n\n             Judicial review of all questions of law and\n             fact, including interpretation and application\n             of constitutional and statutory provisions,\n             arising from any action taken or proceeding\n             brought to remove an alien from the United\n             States . . . shall be available only in\n             judicial review of a final order under this\n             section. Except as otherwise provided in this\n             section, no court shall have jurisdiction, by\n             habeas corpus under Section 2241 of Title 28,\n             or any other habeas corpus provision . . . or\n             by any other provision of law (statutory or\n             nonstatutory), to review such an order or such\n             questions of law or fact.\n\nThe Supreme Court has described this provision as a \"general\n\njurisdictional     limitation\"   and      as    \"an   unmistakable   'zipper'\n\nclause.\"   Reno v. Am.-Arab Anti-Discrim. Comm., 525 U.S. 471, 482-\n\n83 (1999).    By its terms, the provision encompasses \"all questions\n\nof law and fact\" and extends to both \"constitutional and statutory\"\n\nchallenges.     Its expanse is breathtaking.\n\n             Congress's purpose in enacting section 1252(b)(9) is\n\nevident.   As its text makes manifest, that proviso was designed to\n\nconsolidate and channel review of all legal and factual questions\n\nthat arise from the removal of an alien into the administrative\n\nprocess, with judicial review of those decisions vested exclusively\n\nin the courts of appeals.        See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(5) (ordaining\n\nthat \"a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of\n\n                                    -10-\n\fappeals . . . shall be the sole and exclusive means for judicial\n\nreview of an order of removal\").     In enacting section 1252(b)(9),\n\nCongress plainly intended to put an end to the scattershot and\n\npiecemeal nature of the review process that previously had held\n\nsway in regard to removal proceedings.       See H.R. Rep. No. 109-72,\n\nat 174 (2005) (Conf. Rep.), reprinted in 2005 U.S.C.C.A.N. 240,\n\n299.\n\n          While paying lip service to the breadth and purpose of\n\nsection   1252(b)(9),   the   petitioners     endeavor   to   avoid   its\n\nstrictures by reading section 1252(b)(9) narrowly as stripping\n\ndistrict courts of jurisdiction over challenges to ongoing removal\n\nproceedings — nothing more.    On this basis, the petitioners claim\n\nthat the district court's habeas jurisdiction remains intact for\n\nall legal challenges that are unaccompanied by any challenge to a\n\nparticular removal proceeding.      That is wishful thinking; as we\n\nexplain below, such a construct belies the statute's plain meaning\n\nand runs contrary to Congress's discernible intent.\n\n          Undocumented aliens cannot escape the vise-like grip of\n\nsection 1252(b)(9) by the simple expedient of banding together\n\nclaims consigned by law to administrative channels, declining to\n\nraise them within the ambit of removal proceedings per se, and\n\nmaintaining that those unexhausted claims do not implicate a\n\nparticular removal determination.       The reach of section 1252(b)(9)\n\nis not limited to challenges to singular orders of removal or to\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fremoval proceedings simpliciter.           By its terms, the provision aims\n\nto consolidate \"all questions of law and fact\" that \"arise from\"\n\neither an \"action\" or a \"proceeding\" brought in connection with the\n\nremoval of an alien.       See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9).          Importantly, the\n\nstatute channels federal court jurisdiction over \"such questions of\n\nlaw and fact\" to the courts of appeals and explicitly bars all\n\nother methods of judicial review, including habeas.                Id.\n\n             The    petitioners    cannot      skirt    the   statutory   channel\n\nmarkers by lumping together a melange of claims associated with\n\nremoval, each of which would be jurisdictionally barred if brought\n\nalone, and eschewing a direct challenge to any particular removal\n\nproceeding.    Such claim-splitting — pursuing selected arguments in\n\nthe district court and leaving others for adjudication in the\n\nimmigration court — heralds an obvious loss of efficiency and\n\nbifurcation of review mechanisms.              These are among the principal\n\nevils that Congress sought to avoid through the passage of section\n\n1252(b)(9).        See H.R. Rep. No. 109-72, at 174, reprinted in 2005\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. at 299.          It is our task to enforce the statute as\n\nCongress wrote it, and we reject the petitioners' invitation to\n\nread   the   statute     in   a   way   that    would    frustrate   Congress's\n\nunmistakable purpose.\n\n             In a somewhat related vein, the petitioners insist that\n\nthe challenged actions occurred prior to the institution of any\n\nformal removal proceedings and, thus, are beyond the compass of the\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\fzipper clause.         Although their factual premise is unarguably\n\ncorrect, their conclusion is not; nothing in the statute limits its\n\nreach to claims arising from extant removal proceedings.                   Reading\n\nthe statute to limit the exhaustion requirement to claims that\n\narise from ongoing removal proceedings would put an undue premium\n\non which party rushed to the courthouse first.                 More importantly,\n\nsuch a reading would render the word \"action\" superfluous and\n\neffectively excise it from the statute.             Yet it is a familiar canon\n\nof construction that, whenever possible, every word and phrase in\n\na statute should be given effect.            See, e.g., United States v. Ven-\n\nFuel, Inc., 758 F.2d 741, 751-52 (1st Cir. 1985).                      That canon\n\ndemands our fidelity here.\n\n               None of this is to imply that section 1252(b)(9) is\n\nlimitless in its scope.             The words \"arising from\" do not lend\n\nthemselves to precise application, see Hiroshi Motomura, Judicial\n\nReview    in    Immigration       Cases    After   AADC:    Lessons   from   Civil\n\nProcedure, 14 Geo. Immigr. L.J. 385, 424 (2000), and courts have\n\ndebated their meaning in other settings, see Humphries v. Various\n\nFed. USINS Employees, 164 F.3d 936, 943 (5th Cir. 1999) (collecting\n\ncases).        One   thing   is    clear,    however:      those   words   are   not\n\ninfinitely elastic.          Cf. Louisville & Nashville R.R. v. Mottley,\n\n211 U.S. 149, 152 (1908) (famously reading the analogous term\n\n\"arising under\" more narrowly than plain meaning might suggest).\n\nWith respect to section 1252(b)(9), these words cannot be read to\n\n\n                                          -13-\n\fswallow all claims that might somehow touch upon, or be traced to,\n\nthe government's efforts to remove an alien.\n\n          To us, Congress's choice of phrase suggests that it did\n\nnot intend section 1252(b)(9) to sweep within its scope claims with\n\nonly a remote or attenuated connection to the removal of an alien.\n\nCourts consistently have recognized that the term \"arising from\"\n\nrequires more than a weak or tenuous connection to a triggering\n\nevent.   See, e.g., Franchise Tax Bd. v. Constr. Laborers Vacation\n\nTrust, 465 U.S. 1, 27 n.32 (1983); Humphries, 164 F.3d at 943;\n\nPizarro v. Hoteles Cocorde Int'l, C.A., 907 F.2d 1256, 1259 (1st\n\nCir. 1990).\n\n          Furthermore, if Congress had intended to accomplish so\n\nfar-reaching a result, it could have used broader language.    Cf.\n\nMcNary v. Haitian Refugee Ctr., Inc., 498 U.S. 479, 496 (1991)\n\n(suggesting that if Congress intended a certain provision of the\n\nINA to be read more expansively, it could have used more expansive\n\nlanguage). For example, Congress would have used the term \"related\n\nto\" instead of \"arising from.\"     See Humphries, 164 F.3d at 943\n\n(suggesting that \"related to\" signifies a somewhat looser nexus\n\nthan \"arising from\").\n\n          Such a bounded reading of the statute is also suggested\n\nby the fact that certain claims are excluded from the sweep of\n\nsection 1252(b)(9) by virtue of legislative intent and judicial\n\nprecedent.    To illustrate, the legislative history indicates that\n\n\n                                -14-\n\fCongress intended to create an exception for claims \"independent\"\n\nof removal.    H.R. Rep. No. 109-72, at 175, as reprinted in 2005\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. at 300.      Thus, when it passed the REAL ID Act,\n\nCongress stated unequivocally that the channeling provisions of\n\nsection 1252(b)(9) should not be read to preclude \"habeas review\n\nover challenges to detention.\"      Id. (indicating that detention\n\nclaims are \"independent of challenges to removal orders\"). In line\n\nwith this prescription, we have held that district courts retain\n\njurisdiction over challenges to the legality of detention in the\n\nimmigration context.    See Hernández v. Gonzales, 424 F.3d 42, 42\n\n(1st Cir. 2005) (holding that detention claims are independent of\n\nremoval proceedings and, thus, not barred by section 1252(b)(9)).\n\nThis carve-out seemingly encompasses constitutional challenges\n\nregarding the availability of bail.    See, e.g., Demore v. Kim, 538\n\nU.S. 510, 516 (2003).\n\n          There is no reason to believe that section 1252(b)(9)'s\n\nexception for independent claims is restricted to those related to\n\ndetention.    Cf. Sissoko v. Rocha, 440 F.3d 1145, 1156-57 (9th Cir.\n\n2006) (suggesting that the broad jurisdiction-stripping provisions\n\nof 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) do not foreclose aliens' claims for money\n\ndamages under the doctrine of Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of\n\nthe Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 389 (1971)).   After\n\nall, section 1252(b)(9) is a judicial channeling provision, not a\n\n\n\n\n                                -15-\n\fclaim-barring one.2 The provision, where applicable, only requires\n\nexhaustion of administrative procedures and the consolidation of\n\nclaims for judicial review.\n\n              We say \"where applicable\" because removal proceedings are\n\nconfined to determining whether a particular alien should be\n\ndeported.       See id. § 1229a(c)(1)(A).                 While legal and factual\n\nissues      relating     to    that    question     can    be    raised   in   removal\n\nproceedings and eventually brought to the court of appeals for\n\njudicial review, certain claims, by reason of the nature of the\n\nright       asserted,     cannot      be   raised    efficaciously        within     the\n\nadministrative proceedings delineated in the INA.                         See, e.g.,\n\nMcNary, 498 U.S. at 496; Jupiter v. Ashcroft, 396 F.3d 487, 492\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).          Requiring the exhaustion of those claims would\n\nforeclose      them     from    any    meaningful     judicial      review.        Given\n\nCongress's clear intention to channel, rather than bar, judicial\n\nreview      through     the    mechanism    of     section      1252(b)(9),    reading\n\n\"arising from\" as used in that statute to encompass those claims\n\nwould be perverse.\n\n              We   thus       read   the   words    \"arising      from\"   in   section\n\n1252(b)(9) to exclude claims that are independent of, or wholly\n\n\n\n        2\n      Congress knows how to bar claims in the immigration context\nwhen it desires to do so.      See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g)(2)\n(declaring that \"no court shall have jurisdiction to hear any cause\nor claim by or on behalf of any alien arising from the decision or\naction by the Attorney General to commence proceedings, adjudicate\ncases, or execute removal orders\").\n\n                                           -16-\n\fcollateral to, the removal process.           Among others, claims that\n\ncannot effectively be handled through the available administrative\n\nprocess fall within that purview.          This reading, we believe, is\n\nconsistent with the wise presumption that Congress legislates with\n\nknowledge of longstanding rules of statutory construction.                See\n\nMcNary, 498 U.S. at 496.     That presumption traditionally requires\n\nthat there be clear and convincing evidence of legislative intent\n\nbefore restricting access to judicial review entirely.            See, e.g.,\n\nAbbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 141 (1967).\n\n          This holding fits comfortably with traditional legal\n\nprinciples.    Courts long have recognized an exception to the\n\nexhaustion    requirement    for     claims   that     are   collateral    to\n\nadministrative proceedings.        See, e.g., Bowen v. City of New York,\n\n476 U.S. 467, 482-83 (1986); Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 330\n\n(1976).   In that regard, courts have been most willing to deem\n\nclaims \"collateral\" when requiring exhaustion would \"foreclose all\n\nmeaningful judicial review.\"       Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510\n\nU.S. 200, 212-13 (1994); see Leedom v. Kyne, 358 U.S. 184, 190\n\n(1958) (upholding injunction against agency action when petitioners\n\nlacked any other means to protect or enforce their rights).\n\n          As a further reflection of this same attitude, courts\n\nhave   demonstrated   a     particular     hostility     toward    requiring\n\nexhaustion when adequate relief could not feasibly be obtained\n\nthrough the prescribed administrative proceedings.                See, e.g.,\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fMathews, 424 U.S. at 331.         That hostility also manifests itself\n\nwhen a party would be \"irreparably injured\" by adherence to an\n\nexhaustion requirement.        Bowen, 476 U.S. at 483.\n\n                                         B.\n\n            Against this backdrop, we now turn to the question of\n\nwhether section 1252(b)(9) requires administrative exhaustion of\n\nsome or all of the petitioners' claims.              We deal sequentially with\n\nthe petitioners' assertions about their constitutional right to be\n\nfree from harsh and inhumane conditions of confinement, their\n\nassertions   anent      the   right   to      counsel,   and    their   assertions\n\nconcerning the right to family integrity.                    We subsume in these\n\ndiscussions the petitioners' attempt to package their offerings as\n\nclass-wide pattern and practice suits.\n\n            We   need    not    linger        long   over     the   conditions-of-\n\nconfinement claims.       We assume, for argument's sake, that claims\n\nchallenging the conditions of an alien's detention are independent\n\nof removal proceedings.         Cf. Hernández, 424 F.3d at 42 (holding\n\nthat the REAL ID Act does not bar claims that merely challenge the\n\nlength of an alien's detention). Here, however, the conditions-of-\n\nconfinement claims were not raised below.                   That is a significant\n\nomission.    \"If any principle is settled in this circuit, it is\n\nthat, absent the most extraordinary circumstances, legal theories\n\nnot raised squarely in the lower court cannot be broached for the\n\nfirst time on appeal.\"           Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen &\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\fHelpers Union, Local No. 59, v. Superline Transp. Co., 953 F.2d 17,\n\n21 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n           To elaborate, the amended complaint in this case makes no\n\nmention either of harsh conditions of confinement or of cruel and\n\ninhumane treatment during detention.             It only challenges the\n\nlegality   and   duration    of    confinement   —    and    neither   of   those\n\nchallenges are renewed on appeal.\n\n           Going beyond the pleadings, the lone mention in the\n\ndistrict court record of any oppressively harsh conditions of\n\nconfinement is in an affidavit attached to one of the petitioners'\n\npreliminary motions.        That cursory reference is insufficient to\n\npreserve the issue for appeal.         See Paterson-Leitch Co. v. Mass.\n\nMun. Wholesale Elec. Co., 840 F.2d 985, 990 (1st Cir. 1988) (\"One\n\nshould not be allowed to defeat the system by seeding the record\n\nwith mysterious references to unpled claims, hoping to set the\n\nstage for an ambush should the ensuing ruling fail to suit.\"). The\n\npetitioners, who could have asked the district court for leave\n\nfurther to amend their complaint, Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a), have shown\n\nno reason — let alone a compelling reason — that would prompt us to\n\nrelax the prudential rule limiting appellate consideration to\n\nissues   that    were   squarely    raised   below.         The   conditions-of-\n\n\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\fconfinement claims are, therefore, procedurally defaulted.        We\n\nreject them on that basis.3\n\n           The petitioners' right-to-counsel claims stand on more\n\nsolid procedural ground.       Those claims were adequately raised\n\nbelow.   We turn, then, to their viability.\n\n           As the government repeatedly reminds us, aliens have no\n\nconstitutional right to counsel in removal proceedings. See Lozada\n\nv. INS, 857 F.2d 10, 13 (1st Cir. 1988); see also INS v. Lopez-\n\nMendoza, 468 U.S. 1032, 1038 (1984) (stating that since \"[a]\n\ndeportation proceeding is a purely civil action to determine\n\neligibility to remain in this country . . . various protections\n\nthat apply in the context of a criminal trial do not apply in a\n\ndeportation proceeding\").     But aliens nonetheless are entitled to\n\ndue process, Lozada, 857 F.2d at 13, and the INA provides that, in\n\nremoval proceedings, an alien \"shall have the privilege of being\n\nrepresented (at no expense to the Government) by such counsel,\n\nauthorized to practice in such proceedings, as he shall choose.\"\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1362.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      Although the petitioners' amended complaint asserts that ICE\nviolated their due process rights by removing them from\nMassachusetts prior to holding bond hearings, that claim has not\nbeen squarely raised on appeal.      The petitioners' brief only\nmentions the right to a bond hearing in passing, and it is settled\nthat \"issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by\nsome effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\" United\nStates v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990). Consequently,\nwe need not probe this point more deeply.\n\n                                 -20-\n\f           In    this    instance,     the    petitioners     claim   that    their\n\ndetention and subsequent transfer by the government infringed\n\ntheir   rights   to     counsel   by   barring    their   access      to   lawyers,\n\ninterfering with preexisting attorney-client relationships, and\n\nmaking it difficult to secure counsel of their choosing.                        The\n\nthreshold questions are whether these claims arise from removal and\n\nif so, whether they can be deemed independent of, or collateral to,\n\nthe removal process (and, thus, not subject to the channeling\n\neffect of section 1252(b)(9)).               Our answers to these questions\n\nrequire us to hold that the petitioners' right-to-counsel claims\n\nmust be administratively exhausted.\n\n           The shorthand response to the petitioners' plaint is that\n\nclaims that are based upon an alleged deprivation of an alien's\n\nright to counsel in connection with a removal proceeding, whether\n\npending or imminent, arise from the removal proceeding.                      By any\n\nrealistic measure, the alien's right to counsel is part and parcel\n\nof the removal proceeding itself.            See 8 U.S.C. § 1362.      So viewed,\n\nan alien's right to counsel possesses a direct link to, and is\n\ninextricably intertwined with, the administrative process that\n\nCongress so painstakingly fashioned.\n\n           The frequency with which right-to-counsel claims arise in\n\nremoval   proceedings      refutes     any    notion   that   such    claims    are\n\nsufficiently separate from removal proceedings to be considered\n\neither \"independent\" or \"collateral.\" Challenges to removal orders\n\n\n                                       -21-\n\fpremised on the government's putative violation of an alien's right\n\nto counsel are commonplace, and such claims are often featured in\n\npetitions for judicial review of removal orders. See, e.g., Michel\n\nv. INS, 206 F.3d 253, 258 (2d Cir. 2000); Batanic v. INS, 12 F.3d\n\n662, 667 (7th Cir. 1993); Rios-Berrios v. INS, 776 F.2d 859, 862-64\n\n(9th    Cir.    1985).       Ultimately,    allowing      aliens   to    ignore   the\n\nchanneling provisions of section 1252(b)(9) and bring right-to-\n\ncounsel claims directly in the district court would result in\n\nprecisely the type of fragmented litigation that Congress sought to\n\nforbid.\n\n               In this instance, requiring the administrative exhaustion\n\nof such claims does not, in the Supreme Court's phrase, \"foreclose\n\nall meaningful judicial review\" of the claims.                  Thunder Basin, 510\n\nU.S. at 212-13.          The petitioners unquestionably have the right,\n\nunder the INA, to raise these claims before the immigration judge,\n\nbefore the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), and ultimately\n\nbefore the court of appeals.            See, e.g., Mitchell, 206 F.3d at 256-\n\n57.    Thus, the petitioners — in contrast to the plaintiffs in cases\n\nlike Bowen and Mathews — can receive effective relief for their\n\nalleged violations of the right to counsel simply by navigating the\n\nchannels deliberately dredged by Congress.\n\n               The   proof   of   the    pudding   lies    in    the    petitioners'\n\ncollective experiences.           See supra note 1.          In accordance with\n\napplicable regulations, see 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29, each petitioner who\n\n\n                                         -22-\n\frequested a continuance for the purpose of retaining counsel\n\nreceived one.      Many others have been granted changes in venue,\n\nmoving their cases from Texas to Massachusetts.                     See 8 C.F.R. §\n\n1003.20(b).      Each petitioner who raised an issue of this sort may\n\nseek review, first by the BIA and then by the regional court of\n\nappeals, of any adverse determination impacting his or her right to\n\ncounsel.\n\n           We note, moreover, that the petitioners, who assert that\n\nthey will be irreparably harmed if they are required to exhaust\n\ntheir   right-to-counsel           claims       administratively,             have   not\n\nsatisfactorily     explained       how    or    why    this    is   so.         We   find\n\nirreparable harm lacking in this instance. The absence of any such\n\nharm places this case at a considerable remove from cases like\n\nBowen and Mathews, in which the delay attendant to the exhaustion\n\nof administrative remedies likely would have engendered irreparable\n\ninjury. See Bowen, 476 U.S. at 483-84 (not requiring exhaustion of\n\nadministrative remedies because doing so might \"trigger a severe\n\nmedical setback\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted);\n\nMathews,   424    U.S.     at    331   (not     requiring      exhaustion        because\n\nplaintiff's      physical       condition      and    dependence     on       disability\n\nbenefits   would,     in    the     event,      \"damage       him   in    a    way   not\n\nrecompensable through retroactive payments\").\n\n\n\n\n                                         -23-\n\f                                        C.\n\n           The petitioners have another string to their bow: they\n\ninvoke the doctrine of constitutional avoidance.                      See Ashwander v.\n\nTVA, 297 U.S. 288, 341 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring); United\n\nStates    v.   Nascimento,      491     F.3d     25,       38   (1st       Cir.   2007).\n\nSpecifically, they contend that requiring exhaustion of their\n\nright-to-counsel       claims    will     give        rise      to     a    substantive\n\nconstitutional question similar to that noted by the Supreme Court\n\nin McNary.     This contention cannot withstand scrutiny.\n\n           The McNary claimants alleged that the Immigration and\n\nNaturalization Service (INS) — the predecessor agency to ICE —\n\narbitrarily conducted its special agricultural workers program and,\n\nin so doing, violated their due process rights.                      498 U.S. at 487.\n\nIn   particular,      they   complained        that    the      INS    (i)    precluded\n\napplicants     from   presenting      witnesses       or    otherwise        challenging\n\nadverse   evidence     on    which    initial     benefit        denials       had   been\n\npredicated; (ii) failed to furnish competent interpreters; and\n\n(iii) neglected to arrange for verbatim recording of interviews,\n\nthus inhibiting meaningful administrative review of on-the-ground\n\ndecisions.     Id. at 487-88.\n\n           The Supreme Court expressed understandable concern about\n\nthis procedural matrix.         See id. at 496 (reasoning that because\n\nreview of agency action was \"confined to the record made in the\n\nproceeding at the initial decisionmaking level,\" the lack of an\n\n\n                                       -24-\n\fadequate    record   ensured     that     there    would   be   \"no   complete   or\n\nmeaningful basis upon which to review application determinations\");\n\nsee also id. at 497 (explaining that barring district court review\n\nwould deprive the claimants of needed \"factfinding and record-\n\ndeveloping capabilities\").          Given these deficiencies, the Court\n\nquestioned the application of INA's exhaustion requirements to\n\nclaims alleging a \"pattern and practice\" of such due process\n\nviolations.       See id. at 496-97.            The Court suggested that the\n\nclaims     were   \"collateral\"      to     the    review   of    program   status\n\ndeterminations       and,   thus,       not      covered   by   the    exhaustion\n\nrequirements.      Id. at 492.\n\n            The petitioners' analogy to McNary is imperfect.               In the\n\nlast analysis, McNary was a statutory construction case. The Court\n\nheld that the statute governing review of special agricultural\n\nworker program status determinations did not bar district courts\n\nfrom exercising jurisdiction over due process pattern and practice\n\nclaims that challenged the program's characteristic procedures.\n\nId.   The Court noted that if Congress had intended to require\n\nexhaustion of such claims, it could have used clear language to\n\nthat effect. Id. at 494 (stating that Congress \"could have modeled\n\nthe [statute] on 38 U.S.C. § 211(a), which governs review of\n\nveterans' benefits claims, by referring to review 'on all questions\n\nof law and fact'\").\n\n\n\n\n                                         -25-\n\f            This holding is of little succor to the petitioners.\n\nSection 1252(b)(9) sweeps much more broadly than the statute at\n\nissue in McNary.          Indeed, its text tracks the very language\n\nsuggested by the McNary Court as a means of consolidating claims\n\nfor review and channeling into removal proceedings.                 See 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1252(b)(9) (providing for \"judicial review of all questions of\n\nlaw and fact\" arising from removal).               This language is expansive\n\nenough to cover right-to-counsel claims brought by aliens in\n\nconnection with removal proceedings.\n\n            Here, moreover, the right-to-counsel claims do not give\n\nrise to potential constitutional problems of the kind that troubled\n\nthe McNary Court.     In contrast to McNary, the petitioners do not\n\nchallenge the manner in which an entire program — removal writ\n\nlarge — is being implemented.             They do not claim that the INA's\n\nbasic   review    procedures    deny      aliens    the    opportunity   to    call\n\nwitnesses or challenge adverse evidence. And, finally, they do not\n\ndenigrate   the   accuracy     of   the    administrative      record    normally\n\ncompiled in the immigration court.            Whereas in McNary, the lack of\n\na verbatim transcript made some degree of factfinding essential to\n\na   determination    of   whether    the      initial     hearing   afforded   due\n\nprocess, id. at 497, no such problems are apparent here.\n\n            The bottom line is that immigration judges possess ample\n\nevidence-gathering faculties, including the authority to administer\n\noaths, receive evidence, issue subpoenas, call witnesses, and\n\n\n                                       -26-\n\fentertain cross-examination.        See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(1).\n\nAs   previously   noted,    they    routinely       take    evidence   on,    and\n\nadjudicate, claims alleging violations of the right to counsel.\n\nSee, e.g., Wang v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 25, 28 (1st Cir. 2004);\n\nBernal-Vallejo v. INS, 195 F.3d 56, 63-64 (1st Cir. 1999).                  Thus,\n\nthe petitioners' individual right-to-counsel claims will need no\n\nsupplemental factfinding in order to create a solid platform for\n\nfurther administrative and judicial review.\n\n           This means, of course, that reviewing tribunals, whether\n\nadministrative or judicial, can fairly hear and determine, on the\n\nbasis of the record compiled before the immigration judge, charges\n\nthat   ICE's   actions   during    and   after     the   Bianco   factory     raid\n\ntransgressed a particular petitioner's right to counsel.                     Given\n\nthis reality, we are led inexorably to two conclusions.                  First,\n\nMcNary is distinguishable.        Second, the doctrine of constitutional\n\navoidance is not in play in this case.             See U.S. ex rel Att'y Gen.\n\nv. Del. & Hudson Co., 213 U.S. 366, 408 (1909) (explaining that\n\nconstitutional avoidance canon applies only if \"grave and doubtful\n\nconstitutional    questions    arise\"       from    a    particular    statutory\n\nconstruction).\n\n           The petitioners mount several other efforts to subvert\n\nthe INA's exhaustion requirements and the channeling mechanism of\n\nsection 1252(b)(9).      The first of these consists of styling their\n\nclaims as class-wide pattern and practice claims.              They argue that\n\n\n                                     -27-\n\ftheir claims do not challenge any individual legal deprivation but,\n\nrather, limn class-wide violations of constitutional and statutory\n\nrights arising from an unwholesome, but institutionalized, pattern\n\nand practice of conduct on the part of ICE.\n\n           This construct seems to suggest that class-wide pattern\n\nand   practice    claims      are   always     substantively    different        from\n\nindividual claims because the former challenge an established\n\npolicy of the agency, not an individual constitutional or statutory\n\ndeprivation.          While   there     may    be    qualitative     as   well    as\n\nquantitative distinctions between class-wide pattern and practice\n\nclaims, on the one hand, and individual claims, on the other hand,\n\nsee, e.g., El Rescate Legal Servs., Inc. v. Exec. Office of Immigr.\n\nRev., 941 F.2d 950, 953 (9th Cir. 1991), merely conglomerating\n\nindividual claims and posturing the conglomeration as a pattern and\n\npractice claim does not have talismanic effects.                   A pattern and\n\npractice claim is not a freestanding cause of action but merely a\n\nmethod of proving an underlying legal violation.                      See, e.g.,\n\nCelestine v. Petroleos de Venezuela SA, 266 F.3d 343, 355 (5th Cir.\n\n2001).\n\n           Nor do we think that aliens can dodge the channeling\n\nmachinery of section 1252(b)(9) simply by draping individual claims\n\nin the mantle of a class action.          Although the class action device\n\nconstitutes      an    important      weapon    in    the   modern    litigator's\n\narmamentarium, it is merely a procedural device governed by Federal\n\n\n                                        -28-\n\fRule of Civil Procedure 23, and Congress retains the power to\n\nrestrict its availability.      See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(1)(B)\n\n(forbidding the certification of class actions in cases under 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)); McKenna v. First Horizon Home Loan Corp., 475\n\nF.3d 418, 423 (1st Cir. 2007) (holding that class action treatment\n\nis not available for TILA rescission claims).\n\n          We add, moreover, that courts must always be wary of\n\nstrategic behavior designed to sidestep exhaustion requirements.\n\nSee, e.g., Booth v. Churner, 532 U.S. 731, 741 (2001); Coleman v.\n\nThompson, 501 U.S. 722, 732 (1991).          That caveat has obvious\n\nrelevance when aliens seek to employ the class action format to\n\nevade the INA's channeling requirements. Cf. Swan v. Stoneman, 635\n\nF.2d 97, 105 n.9 (2d Cir. 1980) (suggesting that a district court\n\nmay consider whether a \"class claim has been added merely to avoid\n\nthe exhaustion requirement\").\n\n          Ultimately,   then,   we   must   discount   nomenclature   and\n\nfollow the time-honored precept that substance trumps form.           See\n\nNashville, C. & St. L. Ry. v. Wallace, 288 U.S. 249, 259 (1933);\n\nPenhallow v. Doane's Adm'rs, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 53, 104 (1795); SEC\n\nv. SG Ltd., 265 F.3d 42, 46-47 (1st Cir. 2001).         Put bluntly, we\n\nmust look through such easy evasions as creative labeling and\n\nconsider the fundamental nature of the claims asserted.       We cannot\n\nallow collective end runs around congressional directives.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -29-\n\f          Let us be perfectly clear.          We do not suggest that\n\nsection 1252(b)(9) strips district courts of jurisdiction over all\n\npattern and practice claims.     As the Supreme Court suggested in\n\nMcNary, 498 U.S. at 496, requiring exhaustion of certain pattern\n\nand practice claims might result in a total denial of meaningful\n\njudicial review.   The trick is to distinguish wheat from chaff,\n\nthat is, to distinguish what must be exhausted from what need not\n\nbe exhausted. In that endeavor, the most salient questions involve\n\nwhether the underlying claims are cognizable within the review\n\nprocess established by Congress, and if so, whether enforcement of\n\nthe exhaustion requirement will allow meaningful judicial review\n\nwithout inviting an irreparable injury.     Cf. Mathews, 424 U.S. at\n\n331 n.11 (underscoring that \"the nature of the claim being asserted\n\nand the consequences of deferment of judicial review are important\n\nfactors in determining whether a statutory requirement of finality\n\nhas been satisfied\").    When, as in this case, the answers to these\n\nqueries yield no persuasive reason for bypassing the channels that\n\nCongress has created, the use of pattern and practice or class\n\naction nomenclature cannot alter the result.\n\n          The   petitioners'   remaining   effort   to   circumvent   the\n\nchanneling requirements of section 1252(b)(9) rests on a contention\n\nthat the administrative and judicial review provisions of the INA\n\nare   constitutionally    suspect   because     they     foreclose    the\n\navailability of a particular type of remedy.           In essence, they\n\n\n                                 -30-\n\fsuggest that channeling their right-to-counsel claims into the\n\nimmigration    court   might     raise   constitutional     concerns    because\n\nbroad-based    declaratory       and   injunctive    relief     would   not    be\n\navailable in that forum.         We reject this suggestion.\n\n             While \"every right, when withheld, must have a remedy,\n\nand every injury its proper redress,\" Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1\n\nCranch) 137, 147 (1803), Congress has wide latitude in choosing\n\nwhich remedy or remedies are appropriate for the violation of a\n\nparticular constitutional right. See generally Henry M. Hart, Jr.,\n\nThe Power of Congress to Limit the Jurisdiction of Federal Courts:\n\nAn Exercise in Dialectic, 66 Harv. L. Rev. 1362, 1366 (1953).\n\nCongress possesses the power to regulate the jurisdiction of the\n\nlower federal courts, see, e.g., Cary v. Curtis, 44 U.S. (3 How.)\n\n236, 245 (1845), and the Supreme Court has not found constitutional\n\ndifficulties in congressional abrogation of certain remedies as\n\nlong as others are left intact.          See, e.g., Lauf v. E.G. Shinner &\n\nCo.,   303   U.S.   323,   330    (1938)      (rejecting   an   argument      that\n\nrestrictions on injunctive relief contained in the Norris-LaGuardia\n\nAct offend the Constitution); Cary, 44 U.S. at 250 (upholding\n\nCongress's abolition of a cause of action against a tax collector\n\nbased in part on the fact that the claimant \"was not without other\n\nmodes of redress\"); cf. Swain v. Pressley, 430 U.S. 372, 381 (1977)\n\n(holding that \"the substitution of a collateral remedy which is\n\nneither inadequate nor ineffective to test the legality of a\n\n\n                                       -31-\n\fperson's detention does not constitute a suspension of the writ of\n\nhabeas corpus\").\n\n               Courts also have rebuffed litigants' attempts to bypass\n\ncongressionally         mandated    exhaustion        requirements    by   demanding\n\nremedies that the administrative procedures cannot grant.                         See,\n\ne.g., Booth, 532 U.S. at 741 (holding that prisoners must exhaust\n\nadministrative remedies under the Prison Litigation Reform Act\n\n\"regardless       of       the   relief     offered       through    administrative\n\nprocedures\"); Frazier v. Fairhaven Sch. Comm., 276 F.3d 52, 61 (1st\n\nCir. 2002) (\"Exhaustion is beneficial regardless of whether the\n\nadministrative process offers the specific form of remediation\n\nsought by a particular plaintiff.\").\n\n               To sum up, while Congress probably cannot nullify rights\n\nguaranteed in the Constitution by prohibiting all remedies for the\n\nviolation of those rights, see, e.g., Webster v. Doe, 486 U.S. 592,\n\n603 (1988) (requiring clear expression of congressional intent to\n\npreclude judicial review of constitutional claims); but see id. at\n\n613    (Scalia,      J.,    dissenting)        (asserting    that   \"it    is    simply\n\nuntenable       that    there    must     be    a   judicial   remedy      for   every\n\nconstitutional violation\"), this is not such a case.                    The remedies\n\nleft    open    by     section   1252(b)(9)         are   neither   inadequate     nor\n\nineffective to protect the petitioners' rights.                      Cf. Swain, 430\n\nU.S. at 381 (limning this test in the habeas context).                            Each\n\npetitioner's right to counsel can be adequately addressed and\n\n\n                                          -32-\n\feffectively vindicated before an immigration judge (who can grant\n\na continuance, order a change of venue, or take other pragmatic\n\nsteps to ensure that the right is not sullied).                    In turn, those\n\norders can be meaningfully reviewed, first by the BIA and then by\n\nthe court of appeals.          No more is exigible to uphold the district\n\ncourt's dismissal of the petitioners' right-to-counsel claims.\n\n            Before concluding this phase of our discussion, we deem\n\nit advisable to add that, in an abundance of caution, we have\n\nsifted    through    the   petitioners'         pleadings,     briefs,   and   other\n\nsubmissions.        To   the    extent      that   they   arguably    have     raised\n\nprocedural due process claims above and beyond their right-to-\n\ncounsel claims — such as their vaguely articulated plaints about\n\ndifficulties in calling witnesses and in presenting evidence at the\n\nremoval proceedings — we find that section 1252(b)(9) mandates\n\ntheir exhaustion.\n\n            Our     reasoning    is    by   now    familiar.    The   petitioners'\n\nprocedural due process rights \"arise from\" removal in that they are\n\npart of the fabric of the removal proceedings themselves.                       This\n\nimbrication is borne out by the fact that, like right-to-counsel\n\nclaims, claims alleging violations of the right to procedural due\n\nprocess    are    commonplace     in     petitions    for    administrative      and\n\njudicial review of removal orders.              See, e.g., Frech v. U.S. Att'y\n\nGen., 491 F.3d 1277, 1281-82 (11th Cir. 2007); Enwonwu v. Gonzales,\n\n438 F.3d 22, 31 (1st Cir. 2006); see also Gandarillas-Zambrana v.\n\n\n                                         -33-\n\fBIA, 44 F.3d 1251, 1255-56 (4th Cir. 1995) (considering virtually\n\nidentical due process claims on appeal from a final order of\n\ndeportation).\n\n          We conclude, therefore, that given the nature of those\n\nclaims and their wonted treatment, they cannot plausibly be viewed\n\nas either independent of, or collateral to, removal proceedings.4\n\nIt follows that the channeling mechanism of section 1252(b)(9)\n\ngoverns such claims (if, indeed, they have been properly pleaded\n\nand adequately developed).\n\n                               D.\n\n          This leaves only the petitioners' substantive due process\n\nclaims, which allege violations of the Fifth Amendment right of\n\nparents to make decisions as to the care, custody, and control of\n\ntheir children.   See, e.g., Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65\n\n(2000).   We conclude that, unlike most of the petitioners' other\n\nclaims, these claims are collateral to removal and, thus, outside\n\nthe channeling mechanism of section 1252(b)(9).\n\n          We set the stage.     The petitioners were carted away\n\nunceremoniously at the time of the factory raid.   They allege that\n\n\n\n     4\n      To be sure, we have suggested that a \"denial of due process\nmay, in certain limited circumstances, be exempt from the ordinary\nexhaustion requirement,\" Jupiter, 396 F.3d at 492. Withal, we have\nunderscored that \"[t]hese circumstances are rare and are restricted\nto claims that are beyond the authority of the agency to\nadjudicate.\" Id. The petitioners have not demonstrated that their\nclaims deserve such extraordinary treatment.\n\n\n                               -34-\n\ftheir immediate detention, the subsequent string of transfers (many\n\nof them to distant climes), and ICE's inadequate efforts either to\n\nnotify or to work with social service agencies disrupted family\n\nunits.   That alleged disruption forms the centerpiece of their\n\nsubstantive due process claims.\n\n            To be sure, these claims bear some connection to removal.\n\nBut the link is tenuous: the right to family integrity is only\n\nmarginally related to removal, the harm from continuing disruption\n\nmay be irretrievable, and the issue is not one with which the\n\nimmigration court ordinarily would grapple.         Thus, reading section\n\n1252(b)(9) to mandate administrative exhaustion of a substantive\n\ndue process claim that asserts this kind of \"family integrity\"\n\nviolation   likely   would   sound    the   death   knell   for   meaningful\n\njudicial review.     The issue of family integrity is completely\n\nirrelevant to the mine-run of issues that will be litigated in\n\nremoval proceedings, and the claims have no bearing on the aliens'\n\nimmigration status.     To cinch matters, the petitioners have no\n\nother means within their control through which to protect or\n\nenforce the asserted right.\n\n            Holding that the district court lacked jurisdiction over\n\nthese substantive due process claims not only would be inconsistent\n\nwith the express purpose of section 1252(b)(9) — which is to\n\nchannel claims, not to bar them — but also would contradict the\n\npresumption favoring judicial review of administrative actions.\n\n\n                                     -35-\n\fSee Abbott Labs., 387 U.S. at 141.                 And, finally, because the\n\npetitioners would be left without any effective remedy, they would\n\nbe   irreparably     harmed       by    this    proposed   application     of   the\n\nexhaustion requirement.\n\n            In reaching the conclusion that the family integrity\n\nclaims are collateral and, thus, not subject to the exhaustion\n\nrequirement, we do not break with precedent.                   Contrary to the\n\ngovernment's insinuations, this case is distinct from cases like\n\nPayne-Barahona v. Gonzales, 474 F.3d 1 (1st Cir 2007).                   There, the\n\nalien unsuccessfully attempted to wedge a family integrity claim\n\ninto a removal proceeding.              Id. at 2.        Here, unlike in Payne-\n\nBarahona, the petitioners do not base their claims on the notion\n\nthat their removal will split the family unit and thus violate\n\nsubstantive due process; rather, they contend more narrowly that\n\nICE's failure to allow them time to make arrangements for the care\n\nof their children before hauling them off violated their rights to\n\nfamily integrity (and, thus, worked a substantive due process\n\nviolation).\n\n            Because we hold that the district court should not have\n\ndismissed     this       subset    of    claims    for     failure   to     exhaust\n\nadministrative remedies, we must address the government's alternate\n\nargument    that     a    different      statutory    provision,     8    U.S.C.   §\n\n1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), bars the district court from exercising subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction over all of the petitioners' claims (including\n\n\n                                         -36-\n\fthe substantive due process claims).             That statute provides in\n\npertinent part:\n\n                    Notwithstanding any provision of law .\n             . . and regardless of whether the judgment,\n             decision, or action is made in removal\n             proceedings, no court shall have jurisdiction\n             to review —\n\n                                   * * *\n\n                    (ii) any other decision or action of\n             the Attorney General or the Secretary of\n             Homeland Security the authority for which is\n             specified under this subchapter [8 U.S.C. §§\n             1151-1381] to be in the discretion of the\n             Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland\n             Security . . . .\n\nId.    For    present   purposes,      this    language   must   be   read   in\n\nconjunction with 8 U.S.C. § 1231(g)(1), which provides that \"[t]he\n\nAttorney General shall arrange for appropriate places of detention\n\nfor aliens detained pending removal or a decision on removal.\"\n\n             The government says that the latter statute entrusts both\n\nthe timing and placement of an alien's detention to the unfettered\n\ndiscretion of the Attorney General. Building on that foundation, it\n\nposits that those sorts of wholly discretionary decisions are\n\nunreviewable under section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).              Accordingly, the\n\ngovernment    urges   us   to   find    that   the   district    court   lacked\n\njurisdiction over constitutional and statutory claims, such as the\n\nsubstantive due process claims advanced by the petitioners, arising\n\nout of the petitioners' detention and transfers.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -37-\n\f            We reject the government's sprawling construction of\n\nsection 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).         As we have noted before, so broad a\n\nreading is not evident from the statute's text.                   See Royal Siam\n\nCorp. v. Chertoff, 484 F.3d 139, 143 (1st Cir. 2007).                      A more\n\nnatural    reading    would   leave    the    petitioners'       substantive    due\n\nprocess claims outside the reach of the statute.\n\n            In the first instance, there is considerable uncertainty\n\nas to whether section 1231(g)(1) encompasses the authority to\n\ntransfer detainees. The first sentence of the provision — granting\n\nthe power to \"arrange for appropriate places of detention for\n\naliens detained\" — suggests that it might; the second sentence,\n\nwhich authorizes the Attorney General \"to acquire land and to\n\nacquire,    build    and    remodel,   repair,      and   operate   facilities,\"\n\nreflects more of a bricks-and-mortar orientation.\n\n            Here, however, this question of statutory interpretation\n\nis of mainly academic interest.         We need not resolve it because, in\n\nall events, section 1231(g) fails to \"specify\" that individualized\n\ntransfer decisions are in the Attorney General's discretion.                   This\n\nis in stark contrast to other sections of the INA.                  See, e.g., 8\n\nU.S.C.      §§      1157(c)(1),        1181(a)(9)(B)(v),          1184(c)(6)(F),\n\n1229b(b)(2)(D); see also Alaka v. Att'y Gen., 456 F.3d 88, 97 (3d\n\nCir.   2006)     (stating   that   \"there     are   no    less   than   thirty-two\n\nadditional provisions in the very subchapter of the INA referenced\n\nby 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) that make explicit the grant of\n\n\n                                       -38-\n\f'discretion' to the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland\n\nSecurity\").     If a statute does not explicitly specify a particular\n\nauthority as discretionary, section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) does not bar\n\njudicial review of an ensuing agency action.                     See Alsamhouri v.\n\nGonzales, 484 F.3d 117, 122 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n              We are aware that one respected court has stated that\n\nsection   1252(a)(2)(B)(ii)            pretermits      judicial       review    of   the\n\nAttorney General's decision to transfer detainees.                       Van Dinh v.\n\nReno, 197 F.3d 427, 433 (10th Cir. 1999).                     There, the panel said\n\nthat it was giving effect to the \"literal meaning\" of the statute.\n\nId.   But this is a minority view: as other courts have recognized,\n\nthe   plain    language    of    the     statute      calls   that    statement      into\n\nquestion.      See Zhao v. Gonzales, 404 F.3d 295, 303 n.6 (5th Cir.\n\n2005) (concluding that \"Van Dinh . . . misstates the statutory\n\ntext\" and \"analyze[s] statutory language that Congress did not\n\nadopt\"); Spencer Enters., Inc. v. United States, 345 F.3d 683, 691\n\n(9th Cir. 2003) (finding Van Dinh's reasoning unpersuasive because\n\n\"the plain language of [section] 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) requires that\n\ndiscretionary authority be specified by the statute\").\n\n              We share the view of the Fifth and Ninth Circuits.\n\nConsequently,      we     reject       Van     Dinh    and     hold    that     section\n\n1252(a)(2)(B)(ii)         does     not       strip    the     district    courts      of\n\njurisdiction      over    substantive          due    process    claims       that    are\n\ncollateral to removal proceedings when those claims challenge\n\n\n                                          -39-\n\fdecisions about the detention and transfer of aliens on family\n\nintegrity grounds.\n\n                                       E.\n\n            Although the petitioners' substantive due process claims\n\nsurvive the INA's jurisdictional gauntlet, the government contends\n\nin the alternative that these statements of claim fail to limn\n\ncauses of action on which relief may be granted.            See Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 12(b)(6).     The district court did not reach this issue, but we\n\ncan affirm its order of dismissal on any alternative ground made\n\nmanifest in the record.        See InterGen, 344 F.3d at 141.         Thus, we\n\ntest the viability of the substantive due process claims, accepting\n\nas true all the well-pleaded factual averments in the amended\n\ncomplaint and drawing all reasonable inferences therefrom in the\n\npetitioners'     favor.       Educadores     Puertorriqueños   en    Acción   v.\n\nHernández, 367 F.3d 61, 62 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n            We begin with bedrock. The Fifth Amendment mandates that\n\nno person shall \"be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without\n\ndue process of law.\"          U.S. Const. amend. V.         The due process\n\nguarantee has both procedural and substantive aspects.               Amsden v.\n\nMoran,    904   F.2d   748,   753   (1st    Cir.   1990).   Its     substantive\n\ncomponent is at issue here.         That component bars certain offensive\n\ngovernment actions \"regardless of the fairness of the procedures\n\nused to implement them.\"         Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327, 331\n\n(1986).\n\n\n                                      -40-\n\f               The criteria for identifying whether government action\n\noffends the guarantee of substantive due process hinge on the\n\nnature    of    the    challenged    government        action.          See     County    of\n\nSacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 847 n.8 (1998); DePoutot v.\n\nRaffaelly, 424 F.3d 112, 118 (1st Cir. 2005).                          When challenging\n\nexecutive action under the imprimatur of substantive due process,\n\n\"the threshold question is whether the behavior of the governmental\n\nofficer is so egregious, so outrageous, that it may fairly be said\n\nto shock the contemporary conscience.\" Lewis, 523 U.S. at 847 n.8.\n\nThis mantra reflects a realization that challenges to executive\n\naction must be viewed through the prism of \"a particular need to\n\npreserve the constitutional proportions of constitutional claims,\n\nlest the Constitution be demoted to what we have called a font of\n\ntort law.\"       Id.\n\n               Consistent     with         this       need        to    refrain      from\n\nconstitutionalizing ordinary misfeasance or malfeasance, the \"shock\n\nthe    conscience\"      standard     erects       a   high   hurdle       for    would-be\n\nclaimants.      As a result, \"liability for negligently inflicted harm\n\nis    categorically      beneath     the    threshold        of    [substantive]         due\n\nprocess.\"       Id. at 849.    Indeed, \"the requisite arbitrariness and\n\ncaprice must be stunning, evidencing more than humdrum legal\n\nerror.\"    Amsden, 904 F.2d at 754 n.5.               That strain of exaggerated\n\narbitrariness historically has involved \"deliberate decisions of\n\ngovernment officials to deprive a person of life, liberty, or\n\n\n                                       -41-\n\fproperty.\"        Daniels, 474 U.S. at 331.           Thus, \"[e]xecutive branch\n\naction that sinks to the depths of shocking the contemporary\n\nconscience is much more likely to find its roots in 'conduct\n\nintended to injure in some way unjustifiable by any government\n\ninterest.'\" DePoutot, 424 F.3d at 119 (quoting Lewis, 523 U.S. at\n\n849).\n\n            Here,        the   petitioners    claim    in    essence     that   their\n\nimmediate detention and swift transfer to distant DROs wreaked\n\nhavoc with their right to make decisions about the care, custody,\n\nand     control     of    their   minor   children,         leaving     many    minors\n\nunattended.        But neither the petitioners' amended complaint nor\n\ntheir briefs offer any reason to believe that ICE's actions were so\n\n\"extreme, egregious, or outrageously offensive\" as to cross the\n\n\"shock the conscience\" line.              DePoutot, 424 F.3d at 119.                We\n\nelaborate below.\n\n            The     petitioners      state    cursorily       in      their    amended\n\ncomplaint that the government \"willfully\" interfered with their\n\nrights.     But any claim of an intentional deprivation is belied by\n\nthe petitioners' concession that ICE took at least some measures to\n\nalleviate any resultant harm.5            Moreover, the petitioners do not\n\n        5\n      This concession squares with the district court's supportable\nfindings that ICE attempted to coordinate with social services\nagencies to assure the adequate care of dependent children and in\nfact took affirmative steps before and after the raid to attend to\nfamily needs. Aguilar, 490 F. Supp. 2d at 43-44. The district\ncourt likewise found that ICE immediately released thirty-five\npersons who had been apprehended due to \"pressing humanitarian\n\n                                       -42-\n\fmake any showing that the amount of time during which they were\n\ndenied the ability to make arrangements for their children was\n\ndisproportionate to what was reasonably necessary to process the\n\nlarge number of aliens detained during the factory raid.              While\n\nICE's actions during and after the raid seem callous in certain\n\nrespects, the facts alleged suggest no more than negligence or\n\nmisordered priorities.\n\n            Our thinking is influenced by a realization that the\n\nevenhanded enforcement of the immigration laws, in and of itself,\n\ncannot conceivably be held to violate substantive due process. See\n\nPayne-Barahona, 474 F.3d at 2; De Robles v. INS, 485 F.2d 100, 102\n\n(10th Cir. 1973).       Any interference with the right to family\n\nintegrity    alleged   here   was    incidental   to   the   government's\n\nlegitimate interest in effectuating detentions pending the removal\n\nof persons illegally in the country.       See Demore, 538 U.S. at 523\n\n(recognizing    \"detention    during   deportation     proceedings    as   a\n\nconstitutionally valid aspect of the deportation process\").\n\n            This is critically important because every such detention\n\nof a parent, like every lawful arrest of a parent, runs the risk of\n\ninterfering in some way with the parent's ability to care for his\n\nor her children.       See Payne-Barahona, 474 F.3d at 3.            That a\n\ndetention has an impact on the cohesiveness of a family unit is an\n\n\n\nneeds\" (such as being the sole caregiver of one or more minor\nchildren). Id. at 43 n.3.\n\n                                    -43-\n\finevitable concomitant of the deprivation of liberty inherent in\n\nthe detention itself.   So long as the detention is lawful, that so-\n\ncalled deprivation of the right to family integrity does not\n\nviolate the Constitution.\n\n          We hold, therefore, that such an incidental interference,\n\nstanding alone, is not of constitutional magnitude.         To rule\n\notherwise would risk turning every lawful detention or arrest of a\n\nparent into a substantive due process claim.   That would place new\n\nand unprecedented constraints on law enforcement activities.   Such\n\nconstraints would be unwarranted.\n\n          Applying the jurisprudence of substantive due process is\n\nan exercise that is \"highly dependent on context and detail.\"\n\nDePoutot, 424 F.3d at 119.     Were a substantial number of young\n\nchildren knowingly placed in harm's way, it is easy to imagine how\n\nviable claims might lie.     But to state a cause of action for a\n\nsubstantive due process violation, the petitioners' pleading would\n\nhave to allege facts that showed a plausible entitlement to relief.\n\nBell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 1968-69 (2007).    The\n\npetitioners have not scaled this barrier.6\n\n          One further point is worthy of mention. While the \"shock\n\nthe conscience\" test comprises the threshold inquiry with respect\n\n\n     6\n      We take no view on whether an abandoned child might in\ncertain circumstances have a cause of action for damages against a\nresponsible government actor. See, e.g., White v. Rochford, 592\nF.2d 381 (7th Cir. 1979). That issue is not before us.\n\n                                -44-\n\fto substantive due process violations, the petitioners also must\n\nshow that the government deprived them of a protected interest in\n\nlife, liberty, or property.       See Pagán v. Calderón, 448 F.3d 16, 32\n\n(1st Cir. 2006); see also Lewis, 523 U.S. at 847 n.8 (asserting\n\nthat the \"shock-the-conscience\" inquiry \"may be informed by a\n\nhistory   of   liberty   protection\").        Here,   the   nature   of   the\n\nunderlying     right   asserted   by   the   petitioners    reinforces    our\n\nconclusion that they have not stated a viable substantive due\n\nprocess claim.\n\n           We see the matter this way.          Although the interest of\n\nparents in the care, custody, and control of their offspring is\n\namong the most venerable of the liberty interests protected by the\n\nFifth Amendment, see, e.g., Troxel, 530 U.S. at 65; Hatch v. Dep't\n\nfor Children, Youth & Their Families, 274 F.3d 12, 20 (1st Cir.\n\n2001), the petitioners have not demonstrated that this guarantee of\n\nsubstantive due process encompasses their assertions.           After all,\n\nthe right to family integrity has been recognized in only a narrow\n\nsubset of circumstances.\n\n           To be sure, the petitioners cite cursorily to cases that\n\ndeal with this right but they conspicuously fail to build any\n\nbridge between these cases and the facts that they allege.            We do\n\nnot think that this is an accident.          The petitioners' claims seem\n\nmarkedly different from those scenarios that courts heretofore have\n\nrecognized under the rubric of family integrity.             They have not\n\n\n                                    -45-\n\falleged that the government has interfered permanently with their\n\ncustodial rights.    See, e.g., Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645,\n\n649 (1972).    Nor have they alleged that the government has meddled\n\nwith their right to make fundamental decisions regarding their\n\nchildren's education, see, e.g., Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390,\n\n400 (1923), or religious affiliation, see, e.g., Wisconsin v.\n\nYoder, 406 U.S. 205, 232 (1972).           Taken most favorably to the\n\npetitioners, the interference alleged here is transitory in nature\n\nand in no way impinges on parental prerogatives to direct the\n\nupbringing of their children.\n\n            We have scoured the case law for any authority suggesting\n\nthat claims similar to those asserted here are actionable under the\n\nsubstantive component of the Due Process Clause, and we have found\n\nnone.7     That chasm is important because, given the scarcity of\n\n\"guideposts for responsible decisionmaking in this unchartered\n\narea,\"   courts   must   be   \"reluctant   to   expand   the   concept   of\n\nsubstantive due process.\"      Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702,\n\n720 (1997) (quoting Collins v. Harker Heights, 503 U.S. 115, 125\n\n(1992)).\n\n\n\n\n     7\n      For example, the petitioners suggest that they had the right\nto contact their family members immediately following their\ndetention.    That is simply incorrect.      Even one accused of\ncommitting a crime does not have an absolute right to place a\ntelephone call immediately upon his apprehension. See Harrill v.\nBlount County, 55 F.3d 1123, 1125 (6th Cir. 1995).\n\n                                   -46-\n\f            This unfortunate case is a paradigmatic example of an\n\ninstance in which the prudential principle announced by the Collins\n\nCourt should be heeded.        Accordingly, we dismiss the petitioners'\n\nsubstantive      due    process   claims       for    failure    to    satisfy    the\n\nprerequisites of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\n\n                                     III.\n\n            We    are    sensitive   to        the    concerns    raised     by   the\n\npetitioners and are conscious that undocumented workers, like all\n\npersons who are on American soil, have certain inalienable rights.\n\nBut in the first instance, it is Congress — not the judiciary —\n\nthat has the responsibility of prescribing a framework for the\n\nvindication of those rights.             When Congress speaks clearly and\n\nformulates a regime that satisfies constitutional imperatives, the\n\ncourts must follow Congress's lead.                  In that sense, it does not\n\nmatter whether a court approves or disapproves of an agency's modus\n\noperandi.\n\n            We add only two comments.                First, we applaud the able\n\ndistrict judge for the skill and sensitivity with which he handled\n\nthis highly charged case.         Second, we express our hope that ICE,\n\nthough it has prevailed, nonetheless will treat this chiaroscuro\n\nseries of events as a learning experience in order to devise\n\nbetter,   less    ham-handed      ways    of    carrying    out       its   important\n\nresponsibilities.\n\n\n\n                                     -47-\n\fThe judgment of dismissal is affirmed.   All parties shall bear\n\ntheir own costs.\n\n\n\n\n                             -48-\n\f",

Enforcement of the immigration laws is difficult\n\nand oftentimes controversial work.          So it was here: the raid led to\n\nthe   detention    of    hundreds     of    undocumented       aliens    and    put\n\nsignificant strains on those involved and those who wished to help.\n\nIn short order, the detainees (many of whom were whisked away to\n\ndistant places) brought a civil action alleging abridgement of a\n\nconstellation of constitutional and statutory rights.\n\n           Confronted with a maze of issues, the district court\n\npatiently sorted through them and, in a thoughtful rescript,\n\neventually   dismissed      the    action    for   want   of    subject      matter\n\njurisdiction.

The\n\ndetainees (whom we sometimes shall refer to as \"the petitioners\")\n\nnow challenge that ukase.         Their appeal raises novel and important\n\nquestions concerning the scope, reach, and interpretation of the\n\nimmigration laws. In particular, it requires us to disentangle the\n\nGordian   knot    of    jurisdictional      provisions    created       by   recent\n\namendments to the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).\n\n             We discern no simple, one-size-fits-all answer to the\n\nquestions presented by the parties. After careful perscrutation of\n\na scumbled record, we conclude that some of the petitioners' claims\n\nare unpreserved, some are subject to a jurisdictional bar, and\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fothers are simply not actionable.

Thus, while\n\nour reasoning differs somewhat from that of the court below — and\n\nour opinion should not be read as an unqualified endorsement of the\n\nway in which immigration officials handled the matter — we affirm\n\nthe judgment of dismissal.       The tale follows.\n\n                                     I.\n\n            We rehearse here only those facts needed to place this\n\nappeal in workable perspective. On March 6, 2007, federal officers\n\nconducted a raid as part of \"Operation United Front.\"                 The raid\n\ntargeted Michael Bianco, Inc., a Department of Defense contractor\n\nsuspected    of   employing      large    numbers     of   illegal     aliens.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, armed with search\n\nand arrest warrants, appeared unannounced at the factory, arrested\n\nfive executives on immigration-related criminal charges, and took\n\nmore than 300 rank-and-file employees into custody for civil\n\nimmigration infractions.      The ICE agents cast a wide net and paid\n\nlittle   attention    to   the     detainees'       individual   or     family\n\ncircumstances.\n\n            The   government's     subsequent   actions      regarding     the\n\nundocumented workers who were swept up in the net lie at the\n\nepicenter of this litigation.       After releasing dozens of employees\n\ndetermined either to be minors or to be legally residing in the\n\nUnited States, ICE transported the remaining detainees to Fort\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fDevens (a holding facility in Ayer, Massachusetts).                       Citing a\n\nshortage of available bed space in Massachusetts, ICE then began\n\ntransferring substantial numbers of aliens to faraway detention and\n\nremoval operations centers (DROs). For example, on March 7, 90\n\ndetainees were flown to a DRO in Harlingen, Texas, and the next day\n\n116 more were flown to a DRO in El Paso, Texas.\n\n              ICE    attempted     to   coordinate    its   maneuvers     with     the\n\nMassachusetts Department of Social Services (DSS) to ensure the\n\nproper care of family members.             It took steps to address concerns\n\nabout child welfare and released several detainees for humanitarian\n\nreasons. Still, the petitioners allege (and, for present purposes,\n\nwe accept) that ICE gave social welfare agencies insufficient\n\nnotice   of    the    raid,    that     caseworkers   were   denied      access     to\n\ndetainees until after the first group had been transferred, and\n\nthat   various       ICE    actions     temporarily   thwarted     any    effective\n\ninvestigation        into    the    detainees'   needs.       As   a     result,    a\n\nsubstantial number of the detainees' minor children were left for\n\nvarying periods of time without adult supervision.\n\n              With respect to the detainees themselves, the petitioners\n\naver that ICE inhibited their exercise of the right to counsel.\n\nAccording to the petitioners, a squad of volunteer lawyers who had\n\noffered to provide the detainees with guidance was turned away from\n\nFort Devens on March 7.            The next day, the lawyers were allowed to\n\nmeet with those detainees (some thirty in number) who had expressly\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\frequested      legal        advice.       The    petitioners       allege        that,\n\nnotwithstanding this largesse, some detainees were denied access to\n\ncounsel after they arrived in Texas.\n\n              On the afternoon of March 8, the Guatemalan consul,\n\nacting   as    next    friend    of   the   detainees    (many     of   whom     were\n\nGuatemalan nationals), filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus\n\nand a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in the United\n\nStates District Court for the District of Massachusetts.                           The\n\naction   sought       the    detainees'     immediate    release    or,     in    the\n\nalternative,      a    temporary      restraining     order    halting      further\n\ntransfers.     The district court enjoined ICE from moving any of the\n\nremaining detainees out of Massachusetts pending further order of\n\nthe court.\n\n              On March 13, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint,\n\nfashioned as a class action, and withdrew their plea for immediate\n\nrelease. The amended complaint named ICE and various other federal\n\nagencies and actors as respondents (for ease in exposition, we\n\nsometimes refer to the defendants, collectively, as \"ICE\" or \"the\n\ngovernment\"). In that pleading, the petitioners alleged that ICE's\n\nactions had violated certain of the petitioners' constitutional and\n\nstatutory     rights,       including:    (i)   the   right   to   be   free     from\n\narbitrary, prolonged, and indefinite detention; (ii) the right to\n\na prompt bond hearing, that is, one held in Massachusetts prior to\n\nany transfer; (iii) the right to counsel; and (iv) the right of\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\ffamily integrity.    The amended complaint further alleged that it\n\nwas \"the established policy and practice of the [government] to\n\nconduct large scale 'sweeps' or 'raids' in which large numbers of\n\npersons suspected of being unlawfully present in the United States\"\n\nare held \"at facilities which are some distance from the site of\n\narrest and under conditions where access to counsel . . . is\n\nimpracticable, if not impossible.\"\n\n            On March 16, the government filed an omnibus motion to\n\ndismiss for want of personal and subject matter jurisdiction and\n\nfor failure to state any claim upon which relief might be granted.\n\nIn due course, the district court allowed the motion to dismiss on\n\nthe ground that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction.            Aguilar,\n\n490 F. Supp. 2d at 48.       The court also dissolved the temporary\n\nrestraining order that it previously had issued.\n\n            The linchpin of the lower court's decision was its\n\nconclusion that the INA, as amended by the REAL ID Act of 2005,\n\nPub. L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231, 302, stripped it of both habeas\n\nand federal question jurisdiction to hear the petitioners' claims.\n\nAguilar, 490 F. Supp. 2d at 46, 48 (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9));\n\nid. at 47-48 (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii)).                 In its\n\nrescript,   the   court   rejected    the    petitioners'   attempted   re-\n\ncharacterization of their remonstrances as pattern and practice\n\nclaims, that is, claims alleging a collective denial of rights\n\ncollateral to removal proceedings.         Id. at 48.   In that regard, the\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fcourt concluded that the petitioners had failed to link these\n\nclass-wide    pattern     and   practice   claims     to   any   specific\n\nconstitutional violation that might be ripe for review.          Id.\n\n            The district court paid special heed to the absence of\n\nany Sixth Amendment right to counsel in removal proceedings, the\n\nabsence of any constitutional right to release on bond, and the\n\nabsence of any constitutional right to have a removal proceeding\n\nheld in a particular venue.     Id.   And while acknowledging that the\n\npetitioners were entitled to the due process guarantees of the\n\nFifth Amendment as well as to certain statutory protections, the\n\ndistrict court concluded that those rights were personal to the\n\npetitioners and, as such, had to be exhausted administratively\n\nbefore the courts could become involved.        Id.\n\n            This timely appeal ensued. In it, the petitioners assign\n\nerror to the lower court's conclusion that it lacked subject matter\n\njurisdiction over their claims and relatedly, to its conclusion\n\nthat the petitioners are only entitled to judicial review on an\n\nindividualized    basis    after   exhausting    their     administrative\n\nremedies.    Overall, the petitioners urge us to hold that they have\n\nstated cognizable claims that are ripe for judicial review and that\n\ntheir action should, therefore, be allowed to proceed in the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\f                                  II.\n\n            Conscious of our role as a court of limited jurisdiction,\n\nwe begin our analysis with the multi-part question of whether and\n\nto   what   extent   the   district    court    possessed    subject   matter\n\njurisdiction to hear the petitioners' claims.

We grant the motion.

They argue,\n\nhowever, that their claims lie beyond the reach of this channeling\n\nstatute.\n\n           Delineating the precise ambit of section 1252(b)(9) calls\n\nfor an exercise in statutory construction.

By its terms, the provision encompasses \"all questions\n\nof law and fact\" and extends to both \"constitutional and statutory\"\n\nchallenges.     Its expanse is breathtaking.\n\n             Congress's purpose in enacting section 1252(b)(9) is\n\nevident.   As its text makes manifest, that proviso was designed to\n\nconsolidate and channel review of all legal and factual questions\n\nthat arise from the removal of an alien into the administrative\n\nprocess, with judicial review of those decisions vested exclusively\n\nin the courts of appeals.        See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(5) (ordaining\n\nthat \"a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of\n\n                                    -10-\n\fappeals . . . shall be the sole and exclusive means for judicial\n\nreview of an order of removal\").     In enacting section 1252(b)(9),\n\nCongress plainly intended to put an end to the scattershot and\n\npiecemeal nature of the review process that previously had held\n\nsway in regard to removal proceedings.       See H.R. Rep. No. 109-72,\n\nat 174 (2005) (Conf. Rep.), reprinted in 2005 U.S.C.C.A.N. 240,\n\n299.\n\n          While paying lip service to the breadth and purpose of\n\nsection   1252(b)(9),   the   petitioners     endeavor   to   avoid   its\n\nstrictures by reading section 1252(b)(9) narrowly as stripping\n\ndistrict courts of jurisdiction over challenges to ongoing removal\n\nproceedings — nothing more.    On this basis, the petitioners claim\n\nthat the district court's habeas jurisdiction remains intact for\n\nall legal challenges that are unaccompanied by any challenge to a\n\nparticular removal proceeding.      That is wishful thinking; as we\n\nexplain below, such a construct belies the statute's plain meaning\n\nand runs contrary to Congress's discernible intent.\n\n          Undocumented aliens cannot escape the vise-like grip of\n\nsection 1252(b)(9) by the simple expedient of banding together\n\nclaims consigned by law to administrative channels, declining to\n\nraise them within the ambit of removal proceedings per se, and\n\nmaintaining that those unexhausted claims do not implicate a\n\nparticular removal determination.       The reach of section 1252(b)(9)\n\nis not limited to challenges to singular orders of removal or to\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fremoval proceedings simpliciter.           By its terms, the provision aims\n\nto consolidate \"all questions of law and fact\" that \"arise from\"\n\neither an \"action\" or a \"proceeding\" brought in connection with the\n\nremoval of an alien.       See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9).          Importantly, the\n\nstatute channels federal court jurisdiction over \"such questions of\n\nlaw and fact\" to the courts of appeals and explicitly bars all\n\nother methods of judicial review, including habeas.                Id.\n\n             The    petitioners    cannot      skirt    the   statutory   channel\n\nmarkers by lumping together a melange of claims associated with\n\nremoval, each of which would be jurisdictionally barred if brought\n\nalone, and eschewing a direct challenge to any particular removal\n\nproceeding.    Such claim-splitting — pursuing selected arguments in\n\nthe district court and leaving others for adjudication in the\n\nimmigration court — heralds an obvious loss of efficiency and\n\nbifurcation of review mechanisms.              These are among the principal\n\nevils that Congress sought to avoid through the passage of section\n\n1252(b)(9).        See H.R. Rep. No. 109-72, at 174, reprinted in 2005\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. at 299.          It is our task to enforce the statute as\n\nCongress wrote it, and we reject the petitioners' invitation to\n\nread   the   statute     in   a   way   that    would    frustrate   Congress's\n\nunmistakable purpose.\n\n             In a somewhat related vein, the petitioners insist that\n\nthe challenged actions occurred prior to the institution of any\n\nformal removal proceedings and, thus, are beyond the compass of the\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\fzipper clause.         Although their factual premise is unarguably\n\ncorrect, their conclusion is not; nothing in the statute limits its\n\nreach to claims arising from extant removal proceedings.                   Reading\n\nthe statute to limit the exhaustion requirement to claims that\n\narise from ongoing removal proceedings would put an undue premium\n\non which party rushed to the courthouse first.                 More importantly,\n\nsuch a reading would render the word \"action\" superfluous and\n\neffectively excise it from the statute.             Yet it is a familiar canon\n\nof construction that, whenever possible, every word and phrase in\n\na statute should be given effect.            See, e.g., United States v.

To illustrate, the legislative history indicates that\n\n\n                                -14-\n\fCongress intended to create an exception for claims \"independent\"\n\nof removal.    H.R. Rep.

Thus, when it passed the REAL ID Act,\n\nCongress stated unequivocally that the channeling provisions of\n\nsection 1252(b)(9) should not be read to preclude \"habeas review\n\nover challenges to detention.\"      Id. (indicating that detention\n\nclaims are \"independent of challenges to removal orders\").

See id. § 1229a(c)(1)(A).

Requiring the exhaustion of those claims would\n\nforeclose      them     from    any    meaningful     judicial      review.        Given\n\nCongress's clear intention to channel, rather than bar, judicial\n\nreview      through     the    mechanism    of     section      1252(b)(9),    reading\n\n\"arising from\" as used in that statute to encompass those claims\n\nwould be perverse.\n\n              We   thus       read   the   words    \"arising      from\"   in   section\n\n1252(b)(9) to exclude claims that are independent of, or wholly\n\n\n\n        2\n      Congress knows how to bar claims in the immigration context\nwhen it desires to do so.

Among others, claims that\n\ncannot effectively be handled through the available administrative\n\nprocess fall within that purview.          This reading, we believe, is\n\nconsistent with the wise presumption that Congress legislates with\n\nknowledge of longstanding rules of statutory construction.                See\n\nMcNary, 498 U.S. at 496.     That presumption traditionally requires\n\nthat there be clear and convincing evidence of legislative intent\n\nbefore restricting access to judicial review entirely.

We deal sequentially with\n\nthe petitioners' assertions about their constitutional right to be\n\nfree from harsh and inhumane conditions of confinement, their\n\nassertions   anent      the   right   to      counsel,   and    their   assertions\n\nconcerning the right to family integrity.

We assume, for argument's sake, that claims\n\nchallenging the conditions of an alien's detention are independent\n\nof removal proceedings.         Cf. Hernández, 424 F.3d at 42 (holding\n\nthat the REAL ID Act does not bar claims that merely challenge the\n\nlength of an alien's detention). Here, however, the conditions-of-\n\nconfinement claims were not raised below.                   That is a significant\n\nomission.    \"If any principle is settled in this circuit, it is\n\nthat, absent the most extraordinary circumstances, legal theories\n\nnot raised squarely in the lower court cannot be broached for the\n\nfirst time on appeal.\"           Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen &\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\fHelpers Union, Local No. 59, v.

The\n\nthreshold questions are whether these claims arise from removal and\n\nif so, whether they can be deemed independent of, or collateral to,\n\nthe removal process (and, thus, not subject to the channeling\n\neffect of section 1252(b)(9)).               Our answers to these questions\n\nrequire us to hold that the petitioners' right-to-counsel claims\n\nmust be administratively exhausted.\n\n           The shorthand response to the petitioners' plaint is that\n\nclaims that are based upon an alleged deprivation of an alien's\n\nright to counsel in connection with a removal proceeding, whether\n\npending or imminent, arise from the removal proceeding.                      By any\n\nrealistic measure, the alien's right to counsel is part and parcel\n\nof the removal proceeding itself.            See 8 U.S.C. § 1362.      So viewed,\n\nan alien's right to counsel possesses a direct link to, and is\n\ninextricably intertwined with, the administrative process that\n\nCongress so painstakingly fashioned.\n\n           The frequency with which right-to-counsel claims arise in\n\nremoval   proceedings      refutes     any    notion   that   such    claims    are\n\nsufficiently separate from removal proceedings to be considered\n\neither \"independent\" or \"collateral.\" Challenges to removal orders\n\n\n                                       -21-\n\fpremised on the government's putative violation of an alien's right\n\nto counsel are commonplace, and such claims are often featured in\n\npetitions for judicial review of removal orders.

Ultimately,    allowing      aliens   to    ignore   the\n\nchanneling provisions of section 1252(b)(9) and bring right-to-\n\ncounsel claims directly in the district court would result in\n\nprecisely the type of fragmented litigation that Congress sought to\n\nforbid.\n\n               In this instance, requiring the administrative exhaustion\n\nof such claims does not, in the Supreme Court's phrase, \"foreclose\n\nall meaningful judicial review\" of the claims.                  Thunder Basin, 510\n\nU.S. at 212-13.          The petitioners unquestionably have the right,\n\nunder the INA, to raise these claims before the immigration judge,\n\nbefore the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), and ultimately\n\nbefore the court of appeals.            See, e.g., Mitchell, 206 F.3d at 256-\n\n57.    Thus, the petitioners — in contrast to the plaintiffs in cases\n\nlike Bowen and Mathews — can receive effective relief for their\n\nalleged violations of the right to counsel simply by navigating the\n\nchannels deliberately dredged by Congress.\n\n               The   proof   of   the    pudding   lies    in    the    petitioners'\n\ncollective experiences.           See supra note 1.          In accordance with\n\napplicable regulations, see 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29, each petitioner who\n\n\n                                         -22-\n\frequested a continuance for the purpose of retaining counsel\n\nreceived one.      Many others have been granted changes in venue,\n\nmoving their cases from Texas to Massachusetts.                     See 8 C.F.R. §\n\n1003.20(b).      Each petitioner who raised an issue of this sort may\n\nseek review, first by the BIA and then by the regional court of\n\nappeals, of any adverse determination impacting his or her right to\n\ncounsel.\n\n           We note, moreover, that the petitioners, who assert that\n\nthey will be irreparably harmed if they are required to exhaust\n\ntheir   right-to-counsel           claims       administratively,             have   not\n\nsatisfactorily     explained       how    or    why    this    is   so.         We   find\n\nirreparable harm lacking in this instance. The absence of any such\n\nharm places this case at a considerable remove from cases like\n\nBowen and Mathews, in which the delay attendant to the exhaustion\n\nof administrative remedies likely would have engendered irreparable\n\ninjury.

This contention cannot withstand scrutiny.\n\n           The McNary claimants alleged that the Immigration and\n\nNaturalization Service (INS) — the predecessor agency to ICE —\n\narbitrarily conducted its special agricultural workers program and,\n\nin so doing, violated their due process rights.                      498 U.S. at 487.\n\nIn   particular,      they   complained        that    the      INS    (i)    precluded\n\napplicants     from   presenting      witnesses       or    otherwise        challenging\n\nadverse   evidence     on    which    initial     benefit        denials       had   been\n\npredicated; (ii) failed to furnish competent interpreters; and\n\n(iii) neglected to arrange for verbatim recording of interviews,\n\nthus inhibiting meaningful administrative review of on-the-ground\n\ndecisions.     Id. at 487-88.\n\n           The Supreme Court expressed understandable concern about\n\nthis procedural matrix.         See id. at 496 (reasoning that because\n\nreview of agency action was \"confined to the record made in the\n\nproceeding at the initial decisionmaking level,\" the lack of an\n\n\n                                       -24-\n\fadequate    record   ensured     that     there    would   be   \"no   complete   or\n\nmeaningful basis upon which to review application determinations\");\n\nsee also id. at 497 (explaining that barring district court review\n\nwould deprive the claimants of needed \"factfinding and record-\n\ndeveloping capabilities\").          Given these deficiencies, the Court\n\nquestioned the application of INA's exhaustion requirements to\n\nclaims alleging a \"pattern and practice\" of such due process\n\nviolations.       See id. at 496-97.            The Court suggested that the\n\nclaims     were   \"collateral\"      to     the    review   of    program   status\n\ndeterminations       and,   thus,       not      covered   by   the    exhaustion\n\nrequirements.      Id. at 492.\n\n            The petitioners' analogy to McNary is imperfect.               In the\n\nlast analysis, McNary was a statutory construction case. The Court\n\nheld that the statute governing review of special agricultural\n\nworker program status determinations did not bar district courts\n\nfrom exercising jurisdiction over due process pattern and practice\n\nclaims that challenged the program's characteristic procedures.\n\nId.   The Court noted that if Congress had intended to require\n\nexhaustion of such claims, it could have used clear language to\n\nthat effect. Id. at 494 (stating that Congress \"could have modeled\n\nthe [statute] on 38 U.S.C. § 211(a), which governs review of\n\nveterans' benefits claims, by referring to review 'on all questions\n\nof law and fact'\").\n\n\n\n\n                                         -25-\n\f            This holding is of little succor to the petitioners.\n\nSection 1252(b)(9) sweeps much more broadly than the statute at\n\nissue in McNary.          Indeed, its text tracks the very language\n\nsuggested by the McNary Court as a means of consolidating claims\n\nfor review and channeling into removal proceedings.                 See 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1252(b)(9) (providing for \"judicial review of all questions of\n\nlaw and fact\" arising from removal).               This language is expansive\n\nenough to cover right-to-counsel claims brought by aliens in\n\nconnection with removal proceedings.\n\n            Here, moreover, the right-to-counsel claims do not give\n\nrise to potential constitutional problems of the kind that troubled\n\nthe McNary Court.     In contrast to McNary, the petitioners do not\n\nchallenge the manner in which an entire program — removal writ\n\nlarge — is being implemented.             They do not claim that the INA's\n\nbasic   review    procedures    deny      aliens    the    opportunity   to    call\n\nwitnesses or challenge adverse evidence. And, finally, they do not\n\ndenigrate   the   accuracy     of   the    administrative      record    normally\n\ncompiled in the immigration court.            Whereas in McNary, the lack of\n\na verbatim transcript made some degree of factfinding essential to\n\na   determination    of   whether    the      initial     hearing   afforded   due\n\nprocess, id. at 497, no such problems are apparent here.\n\n            The bottom line is that immigration judges possess ample\n\nevidence-gathering faculties, including the authority to administer\n\noaths, receive evidence, issue subpoenas, call witnesses, and\n\n\n                                       -26-\n\fentertain cross-examination.        See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(1).\n\nAs   previously   noted,    they    routinely       take    evidence   on,    and\n\nadjudicate, claims alleging violations of the right to counsel.\n\nSee, e.g., Wang v.

Thus,\n\nthe petitioners' individual right-to-counsel claims will need no\n\nsupplemental factfinding in order to create a solid platform for\n\nfurther administrative and judicial review.\n\n           This means, of course, that reviewing tribunals, whether\n\nadministrative or judicial, can fairly hear and determine, on the\n\nbasis of the record compiled before the immigration judge, charges\n\nthat   ICE's   actions   during    and   after     the   Bianco   factory     raid\n\ntransgressed a particular petitioner's right to counsel.

The first of these consists of styling their\n\nclaims as class-wide pattern and practice claims.              They argue that\n\n\n                                     -27-\n\ftheir claims do not challenge any individual legal deprivation but,\n\nrather, limn class-wide violations of constitutional and statutory\n\nrights arising from an unwholesome, but institutionalized, pattern\n\nand practice of conduct on the part of ICE.\n\n           This construct seems to suggest that class-wide pattern\n\nand   practice    claims      are   always     substantively    different        from\n\nindividual claims because the former challenge an established\n\npolicy of the agency, not an individual constitutional or statutory\n\ndeprivation.

Put bluntly, we\n\nmust look through such easy evasions as creative labeling and\n\nconsider the fundamental nature of the claims asserted.       We cannot\n\nallow collective end runs around congressional directives.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -29-\n\f          Let us be perfectly clear.          We do not suggest that\n\nsection 1252(b)(9) strips district courts of jurisdiction over all\n\npattern and practice claims.     As the Supreme Court suggested in\n\nMcNary, 498 U.S. at 496, requiring exhaustion of certain pattern\n\nand practice claims might result in a total denial of meaningful\n\njudicial review.   The trick is to distinguish wheat from chaff,\n\nthat is, to distinguish what must be exhausted from what need not\n\nbe exhausted. In that endeavor, the most salient questions involve\n\nwhether the underlying claims are cognizable within the review\n\nprocess established by Congress, and if so, whether enforcement of\n\nthe exhaustion requirement will allow meaningful judicial review\n\nwithout inviting an irreparable injury.     Cf. Mathews, 424 U.S. at\n\n331 n.11 (underscoring that \"the nature of the claim being asserted\n\nand the consequences of deferment of judicial review are important\n\nfactors in determining whether a statutory requirement of finality\n\nhas been satisfied\").    When, as in this case, the answers to these\n\nqueries yield no persuasive reason for bypassing the channels that\n\nCongress has created, the use of pattern and practice or class\n\naction nomenclature cannot alter the result.\n\n          The   petitioners'   remaining   effort   to   circumvent   the\n\nchanneling requirements of section 1252(b)(9) rests on a contention\n\nthat the administrative and judicial review provisions of the INA\n\nare   constitutionally    suspect   because     they     foreclose    the\n\navailability of a particular type of remedy.           In essence, they\n\n\n                                 -30-\n\fsuggest that channeling their right-to-counsel claims into the\n\nimmigration    court   might     raise   constitutional     concerns    because\n\nbroad-based    declaratory       and   injunctive    relief     would   not    be\n\navailable in that forum.         We reject this suggestion.\n\n             While \"every right, when withheld, must have a remedy,\n\nand every injury its proper redress,\" Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1\n\nCranch) 137, 147 (1803), Congress has wide latitude in choosing\n\nwhich remedy or remedies are appropriate for the violation of a\n\nparticular constitutional right. See generally Henry M. Hart, Jr.,\n\nThe Power of Congress to Limit the Jurisdiction of Federal Courts:\n\nAn Exercise in Dialectic, 66 Harv. L.

No more is exigible to uphold the district\n\ncourt's dismissal of the petitioners' right-to-counsel claims.\n\n            Before concluding this phase of our discussion, we deem\n\nit advisable to add that, in an abundance of caution, we have\n\nsifted    through    the   petitioners'         pleadings,     briefs,   and   other\n\nsubmissions.        To   the    extent      that   they   arguably    have     raised\n\nprocedural due process claims above and beyond their right-to-\n\ncounsel claims — such as their vaguely articulated plaints about\n\ndifficulties in calling witnesses and in presenting evidence at the\n\nremoval proceedings — we find that section 1252(b)(9) mandates\n\ntheir exhaustion.\n\n            Our     reasoning    is    by   now    familiar.    The   petitioners'\n\nprocedural due process rights \"arise from\" removal in that they are\n\npart of the fabric of the removal proceedings themselves.

We conclude that, unlike most of the petitioners' other\n\nclaims, these claims are collateral to removal and, thus, outside\n\nthe channeling mechanism of section 1252(b)(9).\n\n          We set the stage.     The petitioners were carted away\n\nunceremoniously at the time of the factory raid.   They allege that\n\n\n\n     4\n      To be sure, we have suggested that a \"denial of due process\nmay, in certain limited circumstances, be exempt from the ordinary\nexhaustion requirement,\" Jupiter, 396 F.3d at 492. Withal, we have\nunderscored that \"[t]hese circumstances are rare and are restricted\nto claims that are beyond the authority of the agency to\nadjudicate.\" Id. The petitioners have not demonstrated that their\nclaims deserve such extraordinary treatment.\n\n\n                               -34-\n\ftheir immediate detention, the subsequent string of transfers (many\n\nof them to distant climes), and ICE's inadequate efforts either to\n\nnotify or to work with social service agencies disrupted family\n\nunits.   That alleged disruption forms the centerpiece of their\n\nsubstantive due process claims.\n\n            To be sure, these claims bear some connection to removal.\n\nBut the link is tenuous: the right to family integrity is only\n\nmarginally related to removal, the harm from continuing disruption\n\nmay be irretrievable, and the issue is not one with which the\n\nimmigration court ordinarily would grapple.         Thus, reading section\n\n1252(b)(9) to mandate administrative exhaustion of a substantive\n\ndue process claim that asserts this kind of \"family integrity\"\n\nviolation   likely   would   sound    the   death   knell   for   meaningful\n\njudicial review.     The issue of family integrity is completely\n\nirrelevant to the mine-run of issues that will be litigated in\n\nremoval proceedings, and the claims have no bearing on the aliens'\n\nimmigration status.     To cinch matters, the petitioners have no\n\nother means within their control through which to protect or\n\nenforce the asserted right.\n\n            Holding that the district court lacked jurisdiction over\n\nthese substantive due process claims not only would be inconsistent\n\nwith the express purpose of section 1252(b)(9) — which is to\n\nchannel claims, not to bar them — but also would contradict the\n\npresumption favoring judicial review of administrative actions.\n\n\n                                     -35-\n\fSee Abbott Labs., 387 U.S. at 141.                 And, finally, because the\n\npetitioners would be left without any effective remedy, they would\n\nbe   irreparably     harmed       by    this    proposed   application     of   the\n\nexhaustion requirement.\n\n            In reaching the conclusion that the family integrity\n\nclaims are collateral and, thus, not subject to the exhaustion\n\nrequirement, we do not break with precedent.                   Contrary to the\n\ngovernment's insinuations, this case is distinct from cases like\n\nPayne-Barahona v.

There, the\n\nalien unsuccessfully attempted to wedge a family integrity claim\n\ninto a removal proceeding.              Id. at 2.        Here, unlike in Payne-\n\nBarahona, the petitioners do not base their claims on the notion\n\nthat their removal will split the family unit and thus violate\n\nsubstantive due process; rather, they contend more narrowly that\n\nICE's failure to allow them time to make arrangements for the care\n\nof their children before hauling them off violated their rights to\n\nfamily integrity (and, thus, worked a substantive due process\n\nviolation).\n\n            Because we hold that the district court should not have\n\ndismissed     this       subset    of    claims    for     failure   to     exhaust\n\nadministrative remedies, we must address the government's alternate\n\nargument    that     a    different      statutory    provision,     8    U.S.C.   §\n\n1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), bars the district court from exercising subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction over all of the petitioners' claims (including\n\n\n                                         -36-\n\fthe substantive due process claims).             That statute provides in\n\npertinent part:\n\n                    Notwithstanding any provision of law .\n             . . and regardless of whether the judgment,\n             decision, or action is made in removal\n             proceedings, no court shall have jurisdiction\n             to review —\n\n                                   * * *\n\n                    (ii) any other decision or action of\n             the Attorney General or the Secretary of\n             Homeland Security the authority for which is\n             specified under this subchapter [8 U.S.C. §§\n             1151-1381] to be in the discretion of the\n             Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland\n             Security . . . .\n\nId.    For    present   purposes,      this    language   must   be   read   in\n\nconjunction with 8 U.S.C. § 1231(g)(1), which provides that \"[t]he\n\nAttorney General shall arrange for appropriate places of detention\n\nfor aliens detained pending removal or a decision on removal.\"\n\n             The government says that the latter statute entrusts both\n\nthe timing and placement of an alien's detention to the unfettered\n\ndiscretion of the Attorney General. Building on that foundation, it\n\nposits that those sorts of wholly discretionary decisions are\n\nunreviewable under section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).              Accordingly, the\n\ngovernment    urges   us   to   find    that   the   district    court   lacked\n\njurisdiction over constitutional and statutory claims, such as the\n\nsubstantive due process claims advanced by the petitioners, arising\n\nout of the petitioners' detention and transfers.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -37-\n\f            We reject the government's sprawling construction of\n\nsection 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).

A more\n\nnatural    reading    would   leave    the    petitioners'       substantive    due\n\nprocess claims outside the reach of the statute.\n\n            In the first instance, there is considerable uncertainty\n\nas to whether section 1231(g)(1) encompasses the authority to\n\ntransfer detainees. The first sentence of the provision — granting\n\nthe power to \"arrange for appropriate places of detention for\n\naliens detained\" — suggests that it might; the second sentence,\n\nwhich authorizes the Attorney General \"to acquire land and to\n\nacquire,    build    and    remodel,   repair,      and   operate   facilities,\"\n\nreflects more of a bricks-and-mortar orientation.\n\n            Here, however, this question of statutory interpretation\n\nis of mainly academic interest.         We need not resolve it because, in\n\nall events, section 1231(g) fails to \"specify\" that individualized\n\ntransfer decisions are in the Attorney General's discretion.

See Payne-Barahona, 474 F.3d at 3.            That a\n\ndetention has an impact on the cohesiveness of a family unit is an\n\n\n\nneeds\" (such as being the sole caregiver of one or more minor\nchildren). Id. at 43 n.3.\n\n                                    -43-\n\finevitable concomitant of the deprivation of liberty inherent in\n\nthe detention itself.   So long as the detention is lawful, that so-\n\ncalled deprivation of the right to family integrity does not\n\nviolate the Constitution.\n\n          We hold, therefore, that such an incidental interference,\n\nstanding alone, is not of constitutional magnitude.         To rule\n\notherwise would risk turning every lawful detention or arrest of a\n\nparent into a substantive due process claim.   That would place new\n\nand unprecedented constraints on law enforcement activities.   Such\n\nconstraints would be unwarranted.\n\n          Applying the jurisprudence of substantive due process is\n\nan exercise that is \"highly dependent on context and detail.\"\n\nDePoutot, 424 F.3d at 119.     Were a substantial number of young\n\nchildren knowingly placed in harm's way, it is easy to imagine how\n\nviable claims might lie.     But to state a cause of action for a\n\nsubstantive due process violation, the petitioners' pleading would\n\nhave to allege facts that showed a plausible entitlement to relief.\n\nBell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145730\"><a href=\"/opinion/145730/bell-atlantic-corp-v-twombly/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

While the \"shock\n\nthe conscience\" test comprises the threshold inquiry with respect\n\n\n     6\n      We take no view on whether an abandoned child might in\ncertain circumstances have a cause of action for damages against a\nresponsible government actor. See, e.g., White v. Rochford, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"363554\"><a href=\"/opinion/363554/eugene-white-shirley-white-barbara-mcdowell-a-minor-by-eugene-white-her/\"><span class=\"volume\">592</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">381</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 1979). That issue is not before us.\n\n                                -44-\n\fto substantive due process violations, the petitioners also must\n\nshow that the government deprived them of a protected interest in\n\nlife, liberty, or property.       See Pagán v. Calderón, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202216\"><a href=\"/opinion/202216/pagan-v-calderon/\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 32\n\n(1st Cir. 2006); see also Lewis, 523 U.S. at 847 n.8 (asserting\n\nthat the \"shock-the-conscience\" inquiry \"may be informed by a\n\nhistory   of   liberty   protection\").        Here,   the   nature   of   the\n\nunderlying     right   asserted   by   the   petitioners    reinforces    our\n\nconclusion that they have not stated a viable substantive due\n\nprocess claim.\n\n           We see the matter this way.          Although the interest of\n\nparents in the care, custody, and control of their offspring is\n\namong the most venerable of the liberty interests protected by the\n\nFifth Amendment, see, e.g., Troxel, 530 U.S. at 65; Hatch v. Dep't\n\nfor Children, Youth & Their Families, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775863\"><a href=\"/opinion/775863/richard-h-hatch-jr-v-department-for-children-youth-and-their-families/\"><span class=\"volume\">274</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 20 (1st Cir.\n\n2001), the petitioners have not demonstrated that this guarantee of\n\nsubstantive due process encompasses their assertions.           After all,\n\nthe right to family integrity has been recognized in only a narrow\n\nsubset of circumstances.\n\n           To be sure, the petitioners cite cursorily to cases that\n\ndeal with this right but they conspicuously fail to build any\n\nbridge between these cases and the facts that they allege.            We do\n\nnot think that this is an accident.          The petitioners' claims seem\n\nmarkedly different from those scenarios that courts heretofore have\n\nrecognized under the rubric of family integrity.             They have not\n\n\n                                    -45-\n\falleged that the government has interfered permanently with their\n\ncustodial rights.    See, e.g., Stanley v. Illinois, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108497\"><a href=\"/opinion/108497/stanley-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">405</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">645</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n649 (1972).    Nor have they alleged that the government has meddled\n\nwith their right to make fundamental decisions regarding their\n\nchildren's education, see, e.g., Meyer v. Nebraska, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100233\"><a href=\"/opinion/100233/meyer-v-nebraska/\"><span class=\"volume\">262</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">390</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n400 (1923), or religious affiliation, see, e.g., Wisconsin v.\n\nYoder, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108530\"><a href=\"/opinion/108530/wisconsin-v-yoder/\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">205</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 232 (1972).           Taken most favorably to the\n\npetitioners, the interference alleged here is transitory in nature\n\nand in no way impinges on parental prerogatives to direct the\n\nupbringing of their children.\n\n            We have scoured the case law for any authority suggesting\n\nthat claims similar to those asserted here are actionable under the\n\nsubstantive component of the Due Process Clause, and we have found\n\nnone.7     That chasm is important because, given the scarcity of\n\n\"guideposts for responsible decisionmaking in this unchartered\n\narea,\"   courts   must   be   \"reluctant   to   expand   the   concept   of\n\nsubstantive due process.\"      Washington v. Glucksberg, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118144\"><a href=\"/opinion/118144/washington-v-glucksberg/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">702</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n720 (1997) (quoting Collins v. Harker Heights, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112699\"><a href=\"/opinion/112699/collins-v-harker-heights/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 125\n\n(1992)).\n\n\n\n\n     7\n      For example, the petitioners suggest that they had the right\nto contact their family members immediately following their\ndetention.    That is simply incorrect.      Even one accused of\ncommitting a crime does not have an absolute right to place a\ntelephone call immediately upon his apprehension. See Harrill v.\nBlount County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"696598\"><a href=\"/opinion/696598/no-94-5284/\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1123</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1125 (6th Cir. 1995).\n\n                                   -46-\n\f            This unfortunate case is a paradigmatic example of an\n\ninstance in which the prudential principle announced by the Collins\n\nCourt should be heeded.        Accordingly, we dismiss the petitioners'\n\nsubstantive      due    process   claims       for    failure    to    satisfy    the\n\nprerequisites of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\n\n                                     III.\n\n            We    are    sensitive   to        the    concerns    raised     by   the\n\npetitioners and are conscious that undocumented workers, like all\n\npersons who are on American soil, have certain inalienable rights.\n\nBut in the first instance, it is Congress — not the judiciary —\n\nthat has the responsibility of prescribing a framework for the\n\nvindication of those rights.             When Congress speaks clearly and\n\nformulates a regime that satisfies constitutional imperatives, the\n\ncourts must follow Congress's lead.                  In that sense, it does not\n\nmatter whether a court approves or disapproves of an agency's modus\n\noperandi.\n\n            We add only two comments.                First, we applaud the able\n\ndistrict judge for the skill and sensitivity with which he handled\n\nthis highly charged case.         Second, we express our hope that ICE,\n\nthough it has prevailed, nonetheless will treat this chiaroscuro\n\nseries of events as a learning experience in order to devise\n\nbetter,   less    ham-handed      ways    of    carrying    out       its   important\n\nresponsibilities.\n\n\n\n                                     -47-\n\fThe judgment of dismissal is affirmed.   All parties shall bear\n\ntheir own costs.\n\n\n\n\n                             -48-\n\f</pre>",
