Lisa Rusli and her husband, Hendra Lay, are\n\ncitizens of Indonesia and sought asylum, withholding of removal,\n\nand protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT) based\n\nupon Rusli's1 experiences as a Christian of Chinese ancestry in\n\nIndonesia.        The immigration judge denied relief and the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals affirmed.              Petitioners then filed a petition\n\nfor review, which we now summarily deny.                    See 1st Cir. Loc. R.\n\n27(c).\n\n             The brief filed by petitioners' counsel, Yan Wang, is a\n\n\"cut and paste\" affair that appears to present the facts of another\n\ncase -- notably for a person of a different gender than Rusli, who\n\nhad different experiences, in different years, and appeared before\n\na different immigration judge.             This substantive failure to comply\n\nwith     Federal    Rule   of    Appellate      Procedure    28    alone    justifies\n\ndismissal.        See generally Ramírez v.

Further, the brief, by definition, offers no\n\ndeveloped     argument     directed       to   petitioners'       claims,   with    the\n\nnecessary consequence that the claims are waived.

Moreover, after reviewing\n\nthe record we conclude that Rusli's claims fall well short of\n\nestablishing the requisite eligibility for asylum, withholding of\n\nremoval,     or    protection     under    the   CAT.
