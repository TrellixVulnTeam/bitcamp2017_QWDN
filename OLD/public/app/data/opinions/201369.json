Timothy H. Bradley and Kathleen\n\nMary O'Dell appeal from convictions for forced labor and related\n\ncrimes.   The gist of the charges was that the defendants lured\n\nJamaican laborers to New Hampshire through fraud, mistreated them\n\nduring their employ and coerced them to stay.    From the evidence\n\npresented at trial, the jury could reasonably have found that the\n\nfollowing events occurred.\n\n          In 1999, Bradley and O'Dell traveled to Jamaica to\n\nrecruit seasonal workers for Bradley Tree Service, a tree removal\n\ncompany that they operated in New Hampshire.      In Jamaica, the\n\ndefendants convinced two men--Livingston Wilson and Garth Clarke--\n\nto come to work for them in the United States.       The men were\n\npromised wages of $15-20 per hour and lodging in one of two houses\n\non Bradley and O'Dell's property.\n\n          When Wilson and Clarke arrived in New Hampshire to begin\n\ntheir work, they were provided a camping trailer--initially without\n\nrunning water, electricity or heat.    Both Jamaicans were paid $7\n\nper hour rather than the $15-20 they had been promised.   At work,\n\nyells, curses and intimidation were directed at them.1     After a\n\nweek, Clarke fled to New York where he received a phone call from\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      There was also evidence that Bradley was indifferent to\ninjuries of the two men, failing to take them for doctor or\nhospital care when seemingly required. However, the evidence was\nambiguous as to the degree of medical need and the extent to which\nit was requested.\n\n                                 -2-\n\fO'Dell, who threatened to \"kick his ass\"--as well as call the\n\npolice, the FBI, and the immigration service--if he did not return.\n\n          Bradley stated in front of Wilson that he planned to\n\n\"take his gun and go to New York and look for [Clarke].\"      After\n\nClarke's departure, the defendants also seized Wilson's passport\n\nand plane tickets.    Bradley frequently got angry and yelled at\n\nWilson on the job site, occasionally pushing him down.       Clarke\n\nnever returned to New Hampshire but instead went on from New York\n\nto Jamaica.   Wilson eventually returned to Jamaica when his work\n\nvisa expired in October 2000.\n\n          Shortly after Wilson's departure, the defendants again\n\ntraveled to Jamaica and recruited Martin Sadler, Andrew Flynn and\n\nDavid Hutchinson to work for Bradley Tree Service from April to\n\nOctober 2001, promising each of the latter two men wages of at\n\nleast $11 per hour.   When the men arrived in New Hampshire, O'Dell\n\ntook all three of their passports, explaining that in the previous\n\nyear a worker had run away--and that Bradley would hire someone in\n\nJamaica to \"destroy\" that man.     Flynn and Hutchinson were both\n\nfrightened by this statement, believing that murder for hire was\n\nquite feasible in Jamaica.\n\n          As with their predecessors, the three men were badly\n\nhoused and ill-treated.   They were paid $8 per hour rather than the\n\n$11 promised and were charged $50 a week in rent.   When Hutchinson\n\nargued with Bradley about pay and rent, he was told that he only\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fneeded to stay and work long enough to repay $1,000 allegedly spent\n\non his ticket--money that Hutchinson did not have.        The defendants\n\nhindered the men when they sought treatment for injuries or medical\n\ncare, and O'Dell kept tabs on the men's whereabouts although they\n\ntraveled on their own in the neighborhood and elsewhere.\n\n             In September 2001, the local police visited in response\n\nto an anonymous tip that Jamaican laborers were being held against\n\ntheir will.      When interviewed, Flynn and Hutchinson complained\n\nabout their treatment; O'Dell told the officers that the men were\n\nfree to leave but would have to pay for their return tickets.           When\n\nthe police left, Bradley browbeat the men and pushed one of them,\n\nseeking to learn who had called the police.\n\n             During this encounter Bradley grabbed Hutchinson by the\n\nneck and started to choke him.         Flynn fled to a neighbor's house.\n\nO'Dell reported this to Bradley and then herself began to hit\n\nHutchinson.     After a struggle with Bradley and O'Dell, Hutchinson\n\nalso fled to the neighbor's house; from there both men went to the\n\npolice and spent the evening in a shelter.          They remained in the\n\nUnited States until the time of Bradley and O'Dell's trial, working\n\nat   other   jobs   and   apparently    receiving   assistance   from    the\n\ngovernment.\n\n             In April 2003, a federal grand jury in New Hampshire\n\nreturned a 21-count indictment against Bradley and O'Dell.         Counts\n\n1-9 consisted of one count of conspiracy to commit forced labor, 18\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fU.S.C. §§ 371 & 1589 (2000); two counts of forced labor, 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1589; two counts of attempted forced labor, 18 U.S.C. § 1594\n\n(2000); two counts of trafficking into forced labor, 18 U.S.C. §\n\n1590 (2000); and two counts of document servitude, 18 U.S.C. § 1592\n\n(2000).    These counts dealt solely with Bradley and O'Dell's\n\ntreatment of Flynn and Hutchinson.2\n\n           Counts 10-14 were for wire fraud, 18 U.S.C. § 1343\n\n(2000), arising out of the recruitment and employment of Clarke and\n\nWilson.   Counts 15-20 were for wire fraud arising out of the 2001\n\nrecruitment and employment of Flynn and Hutchinson.       Count 21\n\ncharged O'Dell with making a false statement to an FBI agent\n\nregarding her role in Bradley Tree Service.      18 U.S.C. § 1001\n\n(2000).\n\n           After trial in August 2003, the jury convicted the\n\ndefendants on all counts except for the false statement charge and\n\nthe attempted forced labor charges (which the jury did not consider\n\nafter convicting on the underlying offenses). In January 2004, the\n\ndistrict judge sentenced Bradley and O'Dell each to 70 months'\n\nimprisonment (the bottom of the calculated Guidelines range), fined\n\nBradley $12,500 and ordered the defendants to pay $13,052 in\n\nrestitution.\n\n\n     2\n      The statute proscribing forced labor, Victims of Trafficking\nand Violence Protection Act of 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-386, §\n112(a)(2), 114 Stat. 1464, 1486-87 (codified at 18 U.S.C. § 1589),\nwas not enacted until October 28, 2000--after the defendants'\nrelationship with Clarke and Wilson had ended.\n\n                               -5-\n\f          On    appeal,   Bradley   and     O'Dell    contest    both   their\n\nconvictions and their sentences.      In particular, they challenge a\n\nnumber of alleged errors in the district court's jury instructions;\n\nthe introduction of evidence regarding their treatment of Wilson\n\nand Clarke in 1999-2000; and the application of two sentencing\n\nenhancements under U.S.S.G. § 2H4.1.\n\n          We begin with the jury instructions.             The main statute\n\nunder which the defendants were charged is captioned \"Forced\n\nLabor\"; so far as relevant here, the statute makes it a criminal\n\nact for anyone \"knowingly\" to \"provide[] or obtain[] the labor or\n\nservices of a person\"\n\n            (1) by threats of serious harm to, or\n          physical restraint against, that person or\n          another person; [or]\n\n            (2) by means of any scheme, plan, or pattern\n          intended to cause the person to believe that,\n          if the person did not perform such labor or\n          services, that person or another person would\n          suffer serious harm or physical restraint.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1589.\n\n          The   defendants'   first       challenge   is   to   the   district\n\ncourt's instruction defining \"serious harm,\" which read as follows:\n\n                 The term \"serious harm\" includes both\n          physical and non-physical types of harm.\n          Therefore, a threat of serious harm includes\n          any   threats--includes    threats   of    any\n          consequences,   whether   physical   or   non-\n          physical, that are sufficient under all of the\n          surrounding circumstances to compel or coerce\n          a reasonable person in the same situation to\n          provide or to continue providing labor or\n          services.\n\n                                    -6-\n\fBradley and O'Dell claim that this definition expands the meaning\n\nof serious harm beyond the limits contemplated by 18 U.S.C. § 1589.\n\n           Section 1589 is a recent addition to the chapter that\n\nmakes criminal acts of slavery, peonage and holding to involuntary\n\nservitude, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1581-1594 (2000).        Adopted in 2000 as part\n\nof a broader set of provisions--the Victims of Trafficking and\n\nViolence Protection Act of 2000, 114 Stat. 1464--section 1589 was\n\nintended expressly to counter United States v. Kozminski, 487 U.S.\n\n931 (1988).   See H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 106-939, at 100-01 (2000).        In\n\nKozminski the Supreme Court had interpreted the pre-existing ban on\n\n\"involuntary servitude\" in section 1584 to prohibit only conduct\n\ninvolving the use or threatened use of physical or legal coercion.\n\n487 U.S. at 949-52.\n\n           In glossing the new statute, the conference report said\n\n\"serious   harm\"   was   intended   to    encompass   not   only   physical\n\nviolence, but also more subtle psychological methods of coercion--\n\n\"such as where traffickers threaten harm to third persons, restrain\n\ntheir victims without physical violence or injury, or threaten dire\n\nconsequences by means other than overt violence.\"           H.R. Conf. Rep.\n\nNo. 106-939, at 101.      It continued: \"The term 'serious harm' as\n\nused in this Act refers to a broad array of harms, including both\n\nphysical and nonphysical . . . .\"         Id.\n\n           Bradley and O'Dell argue that the conference report's\n\nreference to \"dire consequences\" stands in sharp contrast to the\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fdistrict court's instruction, which states that serious harm can\n\ninclude \"any consequences.\"            They further claim that the district\n\ncourt's definition       could    apply    to    a    broad     range   of    innocent\n\nconduct,    such   as    employers       who    legitimately       convince        their\n\n\"victims\" to continue working, for example, by threatening to\n\nwithhold future pay that is sorely needed by a worker.\n\n            Starting with the extent of pressure, we note that\n\nCongress did not use \"dire consequences\" in the statute; it said\n\n\"serious harm\" and the district court properly charged in those\n\nwords.     We read the instruction's reference to \"any consequences\"\n\nas explaining that non-physical as well as physical consequences\n\nshould be considered.       Instructions must be read as a whole, see\n\nUnited States v. Serino, 835 F.2d 924, 930 (1st Cir. 1987), and no\n\njury, taking the above-quoted paragraph as a whole, could think\n\nthat trivial consequences would suffice.\n\n            We do agree that the phrase \"serious harm,\" as extended\n\nto   non-physical       coercion,       creates       a    potential         for    jury\n\nmisunderstanding    as    to     the    nature       of   the   pressure      that    is\n\nproscribed.     Taken literally, Congress' \"threats\" and \"scheme\"\n\nlanguage could be read to encompass conduct such as the employer's\n\n\"threat\" not to pay for passage home if an employee left early.\n\nDepending upon the contract, surely such a \"threat\" could be a\n\nlegitimate stance for the employer and not criminal conduct.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\f              Thus, in an appropriate case we think that the court in\n\ninstructing the jury would be required to draw a line between\n\nimproper threats or coercion and permissible warnings of adverse\n\nbut legitimate consequences.         However, Bradley and O'Dell do not\n\nappear   to    have   sought   any   such   instruction.   Instead,   the\n\ninstructions sought so badly understated the reach of the statute\n\nthat it would have been improper to have given them.3\n\n              The question, then, is whether the district court should\n\nas a matter of course have included qualifying language explaining\n\nthat some warnings from the employer could be legitimate and to\n\ndifferentiate such warnings from illicit threats.            Arguably, a\n\nstandard instruction should embody such a caveat; it is also\n\narguable that the caveat would be required only on evidence that\n\nmight bring the case within the caveat.        But we need not decide the\n\npoint here because seemingly no appropriate objection was made on\n\nthe record.\n\n              Neither the defendants' proffered instructions nor any\n\nprior discussion on the record suggests that defendants were\n\n\n\n     3\n      Merely as examples, one instruction included the statement\nthat the proscribed threat must be one \"that involves a substantial\nrisk to death, extreme physical pain, protracted and obvious\ndisfigurement, or the protracted loss or impairment of the function\nof a bodily member, organ or mental faculty.\"      Another said in\npart: \"[T]he use of psychological coercion to force someone to work\nis not enough to find a defendant guilty of Forced Labor. . . . The\nGovernment must prove that [the victims] reasonably believed they\nhad no alternative to continue working other than imprisonment or\nworse.\"\n\n                                     -9-\n\fseeking to exclude innocent warnings from the class of threats that\n\nwould violate the statute.    The defendants' only pertinent on-the-\n\nrecord objection was that the court had \"expanded the forced labor\n\nstatute beyond its writing and incorporated areas that are not\n\nenvisioned by the statute.\"    Without further elaboration this does\n\nnot satisfy the specificity required by Fed. R. Crim. P. 30(d), and\n\nreview is available only for plain error.      See United States v.\n\nOlano, 507 U.S. 725, 731-37 (1993).\n\n          The defendants' brief suggests that the plain error test\n\ncan be avoided because of counsel's \"off-the-record\" discussion\n\nwith the district judge about the instructions. If this discussion\n\nhad included an objection to the \"any consequences\" language on the\n\nspecific ground that the phrase required a caveat to exclude\n\nlegitimate warnings (e.g., of no future wages), we would be faced\n\nwith three interesting issues: whether the claim of error was\n\nthereby preserved, whether on these facts there was error in\n\nomitting the caveat, and whether any such error was harmless.\n\n          Off-the-record chambers conferences with counsel on jury\n\ninstructions are not uncommon in civil cases, but are perhaps less\n\nusual in criminal ones.       They are not forbidden by the Court\n\nReporter's Act, 28 U.S.C. § 753(b) (2000),4 although the Second\n\n\n     4\n      Accord United States v. Murphy, 768 F.2d 1518, 1535-36 (7th\nCir. 1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1012 (1986); United States v.\nJenkins, 442 F.2d 429, 438 (5th Cir. 1971); cf. Wright v. Smith,\n569 F.2d 1188, 1190-91 (2d Cir. 1978) (off-the-record bench\nconference in state proceedings).\n\n                                 -10-\n\fCircuit has pointed out that they can create difficulties for a\n\nreviewing court, especially where any effort is made thereafter to\n\nrely on matters that allegedly took place in the off-the-record\n\nconference.       See Wright, 569 F.2d at 1190 n.5.          Whether or not an\n\noff-the-record conference occurs, counsel remains obligated--as we\n\nhave clearly held--to put requests for instructions and objections\n\non the record.      United States v. Coady, 809 F.2d 119, 123 (1st Cir.\n\n1987); see also Fed. R. Crim. P. 30.\n\n                The problem is compounded here because the district\n\ncourt,     in    eliciting   post-charge       objections   in   the   courtroom,\n\nsuggested that counsel did not need to elaborate upon earlier\n\nobjections already discussed off the record.                If there were any\n\nsuggestion that the defendants had objected to the lack of language\n\nprotecting       \"innocent   threats\"    in    their   earlier   off-the-record\n\nconference, we could be faced with a serious difficulty, but no\n\nsuch suggestion is present in this case: the defendants' brief\n\ncarefully avoids saying that trial counsel raised such a specific\n\nobjection in chambers, and the evidence and closing arguments do\n\nnot suggest that a caveat regarding \"innocent threats\" had been\n\nsought.5\n\n\n     5\n      Some circuits are indulgent where an objection on the record\ncross-references what was said in an off-the-record charge\nconference, see United States v. Purvis, 21 F.3d 1128, 1130 (D.C.\nCir. 1994); see also United States v. Murphy, 768 F.2d 1518,\n1535-36 (7th Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1012 (1986). This\ncircuit has been less sympathetic, see, e.g., United States v.\nSantana-Rosa, 132 F.3d 860, 863 n.1 (1st Cir. 1998); United States\n\n                                        -11-\n\f           There was no plain error here.      No evidence was offered\n\nat trial that the defendants made \"legitimate\" threats, so there is\n\nno risk that the jury convicted them for such threats.               The\n\ndefendants' arguable threats or coercion involved the taking of\n\npassports and mentions of violence, combined with what the jury\n\ncould have found to be complementary scrutiny of, or restrictions\n\non, the victims' local travel.         So even if the instruction was\n\noverbroad, it did not \"likely\" affect the outcome or threaten a\n\nmiscarriage of justice, as plain error doctrine requires.             See\n\nUnited States v. Sotomayor-Vazquez, 249 F.3d 1, 19 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n           Bradley and O'Dell also claim that the district court's\n\ninstructions   adopted   an   overly    subjective   test   for   whether\n\nHutchinson and Flynn felt compelled to work by the defendants'\n\nactions.   In particular, they point to the following statement:\n\n           You may also consider Mr. Hutchinson's and Mr.\n           Flynn's special vulnerabilities, if any. In\n           this regard you may consider whether or not\n           all persons are of the same courage or\n           firmness. You may consider, for example, Mr.\n           Hutchinson's and Mr. Flynn's background,\n           physical and mental condition, experience,\n           education, socioeconomic status, and any\n           inequalities between Mr. Hutchinson and Mr.\n           Flynn and the defendants with respect to these\n           considerations,   including   their   relative\n           stations in life. You may consider and weigh\n           whether or not Mr. Hutchinson and Mr. Flynn\n           were vulnerable in some way so that the\n\n\nv. Nason, 9 F.3d 155, 160-61 (1st Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 510\nU.S. 1207 (1994); Coady, 809 F.2d at 123, and counsel would be well\nadvised to insist upon putting fully on the record any request or\nobjection sought to be preserved on appeal.\n\n                                 -12-\n\f                 actions of the defendant, even if not\n                 sufficient to compel another person to work,\n                 were enough to compel Mr. Hutchinson and Mr.\n                 Flynn to work.\n\nThis       and    the   rest   of   the   defendants'    remaining    claims    of\n\ninstructional error are also subject to only plain error review for\n\nthe reason described above, but as to each we find no error at all,\n\nplain or otherwise.\n\n                 The test of undue pressure is an objective one, asking\n\nhow a reasonable employee would have behaved; to rely upon some\n\nhidden emotional flaw or weakness unknown to the employer would\n\nraise various problems (e.g., scienter).                But, as the defendants\n\nconcede, known objective conditions that make the victim especially\n\nvulnerable to pressure (such as youth or immigrant status) bear on\n\nwhether the employee's labor was \"obtain[ed]\" by forbidden means.\n\nSee H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 106-939, at 101; see also Kozminski, 487\n\nU.S. at 952; United States v. Alzanki, 54 F.3d 994, 1000-01 (1st\n\nCir. 1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1111 (1996).\n\n                 Viewed with the rest of the charge, the district court's\n\ninstruction makes clear that any fear of serious harm on the part\n\nof Hutchinson or Flynn needed to be reasonable for an individual\n\nwith       his   special   vulnerabilities.6      Nor    did   the   evidence   or\n\n\n\n       6\n      For example, the same paragraph of the instructions cited by\nthe defendants also directed the jurors to \"determine whether [the\nthreat of serious harm] was sufficient to cause Mr. Hutchinson or\nMr. Flynn reasonably to believe that he had no choice but to work\nor to remain working for Bradley Tree Service.\"\n\n                                          -13-\n\farguments indicate       that    there    were,   or   that   the   jury    should\n\nconsider, any peculiar vulnerabilities of the victims not fairly\n\napparent from their objective circumstances (immigrant status, lack\n\nof local ties).     There is also no indication that the defendants\n\nasked for an instruction to deal with hidden vulnerabilities.\n\n            Bradley and O'Dell's third objection is to the district\n\ncourt's instruction on Hutchinson and Flynn's opportunity to flee,\n\nwhich read:\n\n                   The government . . . need not prove\n            physical restraint; such as, the use of\n            chains, barbed wire, or locked doors, in order\n            to establish the offense of forced labor. The\n            fact that Mr. Hutchinson or Mr. Flynn may have\n            had   an   opportunity    to   flee   is   not\n            determinative of the question of forced labor\n            if either or both of the defendants placed Mr.\n            Hutchinson or Mr. Flynn in such fear or\n            circumstances that he did not reasonably\n            believe he could leave.\n\nPointing to the Eleventh Circuit's pattern jury instructions for\n\ninvoluntary servitude, the defendants claim that the opportunity to\n\nflee is determinative of forced labor--and that the district\n\ncourt's    instruction    once    again    erroneously      replaces      objective\n\nanalysis with a subjective standard for coercion.\n\n            The Eleventh Circuit's pattern instruction is not in\n\nconflict    with   the   charge   just    quoted;      it   tells   the    jury   to\n\n\"consider . . . any reasonable means the person may have had to\n\nescape\" in deciding whether the person reasonably believed that he\n\nwas being compelled to serve.              Eleventh Circuit Pattern Jury\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fInstructions (Criminal Cases) 2003 at 365.     We see nothing wrong\n\nwith the pattern instruction; but the defendants did not ask for\n\nthe pattern instruction and the language that the court used in\n\nthis case is not erroneous.\n\n          The defendants' fourth objection is to the district\n\ncourt's instruction on the payment of wages to victims:\n\n          [W]hether a person is paid a salary or a wage\n          is not determinative of the question of\n          whether that person has been held in forced\n          labor.    In other words, if a person is\n          compelled to labor against his will by any one\n          of the means prohibited by the forced labor\n          statute, such service is forced, even if he is\n          paid or compensated for the work.\n\nNoting that Hutchinson and Flynn were both paid above the minimum\n\nwage, Bradley and O'Dell claim that the district court should have\n\ninstructed the jury to consider whether payment of wages was the\n\nreason for the victims' decision to work.\n\n          Once again, the instruction given is correct.         The\n\ndefendants were free to ask for their own version as a complement\n\nto the charge given but they did not.   Of course, they were free to\n\nargue to the jury (as they did) that the reason the victims\n\nremained was because of pay rather than threats.    The charge as a\n\nwhole made amply clear that the defendants could be convicted only\n\nif their threats and abusive conduct reasonably coerced or forced\n\nFlynn or Hutchinson to provide labor.\n\n          We turn next to an entirely separate claim of error.\n\nOver the course of the eight-day trial, slightly over one day of\n\n                               -15-\n\ftestimony concerned the defendants' treatment of Wilson and Clarke.\n\nThis included their recruitment by the defendants, their experience\n\nat the defendants' hands, and Clarke's flight and the subsequent\n\nseizure of Wilson's passport. On this appeal, the defendants claim\n\nthat    the    testimony       was    irrelevant,    prejudicial      and    comprised\n\nforbidden character evidence.               Fed R. Evid. 401, 403, 404.\n\n               The evidence of the recruitment, low wages and bad\n\nhousing of Wilson and Clarke was plainly relevant to the charges in\n\nthe    indictment       that    the    defendants        had   defrauded    both    men.\n\nHowever, no forced labor counts were based upon their treatment,\n\nsee note 2 above.         Thus one might fairly ask why certain portions\n\nof     the    testimony    as     to    Wilson     and    Clarke    were    relevant--\n\nspecifically, those parts concerning verbal abuse, the apparent\n\nindifference       to    Wilson       and   Clarke's      medical   needs,    and   the\n\ncircumstances of Clarke's flight.\n\n               Evidence of prior bad acts to show bad character, and so\n\na propensity to commit crimes, is forbidden for reasons of policy;\n\nbut prior bad acts that are otherwise specially relevant are still\n\npermitted so long as prejudice does not substantially outweigh\n\nprobative value.         See Fed. R. Evid. 403, 404; United States v. Van\n\nHorn, 277 F.3d 48, 57 (1st Cir. 2002).                         Unfortunately for the\n\ndefendants, most of the key evidence of the treatment of Wilson and\n\nClarke is relevant to the forced labor charges concerning Flynn and\n\n\n\n\n                                            -16-\n\fHutchinson--independent of the forbidden inferences as to the\n\ndefendants' character.\n\n           This    is   assuredly     so     of    what   is    the    most    damaging\n\nevidence--that Clarke fled, was pursued by threats, and that\n\nWilson's passport was then seized.                  These circumstances give a\n\nmalign motive for, and provide the context of, the later seizure of\n\nFlynn and Hutchinson's passports and of the initial threat made to\n\nthem based on Bradley's supposed intention to \"destroy\" a former\n\nworker.    Motive evidence is a settled exception to Rule 404's\n\ngeneral ban.      See Fed. R. Evid. 404(b); United States v. Cintolo,\n\n818 F.2d 980, 1000 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 913 (1987).\n\n           The abusive treatment of Wilson and Clarke, apart from\n\ntheir bad housing, is closer to the margin.                A showing of bad acts\n\nis permitted to demonstrate a defendant's intent or plan, see,\n\ne.g., United States v. Spinosa, 982 F.2d 620, 628 (1st Cir. 1992);\n\nUnited States v. Wood, 924 F.2d 399, 401 (1st Cir. 1991), and the\n\nintimidation of Wilson and Clarke, including their isolation from\n\nmedical care, was arguably part of a pattern of intimidation that\n\ncarried over to Flynn and Hutchinson. Yet bad acts comprising most\n\ncriminal   careers      form   a    pattern       so,   taken    too   broadly,    the\n\nexception could be made to swallow the rule.\n\n           Because      none   of    the     laborers      was    held    in    formal\n\ncaptivity, the government in this case faced inevitable doubts as\n\nto   whether   the   defendants       were    merely      abusive      employers    or\n\n\n                                       -17-\n\fdeliberately   sought   to   compel   forced   labor.   Arguably   the\n\ndefendants' prior treatment of Wilson and Clarke, so far as it\n\nshowed efforts to intimidate them and minimize their outside\n\ncontact, tended to reinforce the inference that the later, similar\n\ntreatment of Flynn and Hutchinson was part of a deliberate scheme\n\nto hold laborers by intimidation. There is certainly precedent for\n\nsuch reasoning.7\n\n          The main issue, then, is not relevance (over and above\n\npropensity) but how much prejudice was added by the less necessary\n\ndetail as to the abuse suffered by Wilson and Clarke.    For the most\n\npart, it was not different than the treatment meted out to Flynn\n\nand Hutchinson and so was unlikely to inflame the jury.      And, of\n\ncourse, Rules 403 and 404 weigh the decision in the government's\n\nfavor by saying that evidence is excluded only if probative value\n\nis substantially outweighed by prejudice.\n\n          We note, finally, that the judge gave the customary\n\nlimiting instruction. Without being naive about the effect of such\n\n\n\n     7\n      See, e.g., United States v. Decicco, 370 F.3d 206, 212-13\n(1st Cir. 2004) (evidence of previous warehouse fire in arson\nprosecution); United States v. Burgos, 254 F.3d 8, 15 (1st Cir.)\n(evidence of defendant's history of narcotics trafficking probative\nof knowledge or intent to arrange drug transaction), cert. denied,\n534 U.S. 1010 (2001); Spinosa, 982 F.2d at 628 (past drug crimes\n\"probative of the fact that [the defendant] was not merely an\ninnocent driver who was involved in the transaction by accident\");\nUnited States v. Hadfield, 918 F.2d 987, 994 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"We\nhave often upheld the admission of evidence of prior narcotics\ninvolvement in drug trafficking cases to prove knowledge and\nintent.\"), cert. denied, 500 U.S. 936 (1991).\n\n                                 -18-\n\finstructions, they are still worth something--especially where, as\n\nhere, the fairly debatable evidence had at least some relevance and\n\nwas not dramatically prejudicial. See Van Horn, 277 F.3d at 58-59.\n\nPerhaps more pruning would have been suitable, but on close calls\n\nof this kind we will not interfere with the district judge's\n\nreasonable judgment.\n\n          This brings us to the last set of issues in the case,\n\nwhich relate to sentencing.     The district court used the 2003\n\nedition of the guidelines and sentenced Bradley and O'Dell under\n\nthe provisions of U.S.S.G. § 2H4.1, captioned \"Peonage, Involuntary\n\nServitude, and Slave Trade.\"     The base offense level for this\n\noffense as to either victim was 22 and, under the grouping rules,\n\nthis trumped the lower levels generated by the fraud offenses\n\nagainst Flynn and Hutchinson.   U.S.S.G. § 3D1.3(a).\n\n          Offense-specific enhancements added three more levels--\n\none level because Flynn and Hutchinson had been held for more than\n\n30 days, U.S.S.G. § 2H4.1(b)(3)(C), and two levels more because\n\nanother felony (here, fraud) had been committed in connection with\n\nthe main offense.   U.S.S.G. § 2H4.1(b)(4)(A).   These enhancements,\n\nwhich raised the offense level from 22 to 25, are the subject of\n\nthe defendants' remaining claims of error.\n\n          The fact that the crimes were committed against two\n\nvictims--Flynn and Hutchinson--doubled the number of crimes but\n\ndoes not double the final offense level; instead, it results, in\n\n\n                                -19-\n\fthis case, in an upward adjustment of two more levels under the\n\ntable provided by U.S.S.G. § 3D1.4, yielding a combined final\n\noffense      level    of      27     for   each      defendant.         The      defendants'\n\nconvictions        for     defrauding         Wilson      and    Clarke        generated     no\n\nadditional upward adjustment.                 With criminal history categories of\n\nI,    both    Bradley         and    O'Dell        were   sentenced       to     70    months'\n\nimprisonment--the bottom of the applicable Guidelines range.\n\n              On appeal, Bradley and O'Dell contest the application of\n\nthe   guidelines         on    two    substantive         grounds:      first,        that   the\n\nenhancements under 2H4.1(b)(3) and (4) are not intended to apply to\n\nforced labor offenses; and second, that 2H4.1(b)(4)'s enhancement\n\nfor    the    related         commission       of     wire      fraud     constitutes         an\n\nimpermissible \"double-counting\" of their conduct.                          The defendants\n\nalso say that Blakely v. Washington, 124 S. Ct. 2531 (2004),\n\nrenders      the   Guidelines--and            in    particular     the     enhancements--\n\nunconstitutional.\n\n              The caption of section 2H4.1 and some of its internal\n\nlanguage refer to \"peonage\" and \"involuntary servitude\" but not\n\nforced labor.        The defendants concede that the section itself does\n\nencompass forced labor under 18 U.S.C. § 1589--and Guideline\n\nAmendment 627 (Nov. 1, 2001) so declares--but they point out that\n\nthe guideline clauses imposing enhancements for length of time and\n\ncommission of another offense refer explicitly to peonage and\n\n\n\n\n                                              -20-\n\finvoluntary servitude and were never amended to refer to forced\n\nlabor.\n\n          Despite some initial appeal, the defendants' literal\n\nlanguage argument is undermined by an understanding of the history\n\nand the underlying policy objectives of Congress and the Sentencing\n\nCommission. In the 2000 statutory amendment adding forced labor as\n\nan offense, Congress' premise was that the Supreme Court had\n\nmistakenly narrowed the definition of involuntary servitude by\n\nlimiting to it physical coercion.    Indeed, the Senate bill handled\n\nthe matter by redefining and enlarging the offense of involuntary\n\nservitude.   See S. Amend. 4027, 106th Cong. § 12 (2000); S. Amend.\n\n4028, 106th Cong. § 12 (2000).\n\n          Ultimately   Congress    adopted    the   House   format   for\n\nremedying Kozminski by creating a new forced labor offense.          See\n\nH.R. Conf. Rep. No. 106-939, at 99-101.      But this new nomenclature\n\ndoes not alter the fact that Congress thought of forced labor as a\n\nspecies of involuntary servitude.        Indeed, the 2000 statute made\n\nother changes to Title 22 of the U.S. Code that make this crystal\n\nclear.   It there described \"involuntary servitude\" in the same\n\nterms used for the new \"forced labor\" offense, calling the former:\n\n          a condition of servitude induced by means of .\n          . . any scheme, plan, or pattern intended to\n          cause a person to believe that, if the person\n          did not enter into or continue in such\n          condition, that person or another person would\n          suffer serious harm or physical restraint . .\n          . .\n\n\n                                  -21-\n\fVictims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, §\n\n103(5), 114 Stat. at 1469 (codified at 22 U.S.C. § 7102(5) (2000)).\n\nSimilarly, the Act's purposes state that \"[i]nvoluntary servitude\n\nstatutes are intended to reach cases in which persons are held in\n\na condition of servitude through nonviolent coercion.\"                Id. §\n\n102(13), 114 Stat. at 1467 (codified at 22 U.S.C. § 7101(b)(13)\n\n(2000)).\n\n            Thus, Congress' evident purpose, properly attributed to\n\nthe Commission, was to treat forced labor as a form of involuntary\n\nservitude. It follows that an enhancement applicable to the latter\n\nreaches    the   former--just   as   section   2H4.1   of   the   Guidelines\n\nembraces \"forced labor\" despite its narrower caption (\"Peonage,\n\nInvoluntary Servitude, and Slave Trade\"). Against this background,\n\nthe defendants place too much reliance on the Commission's failure\n\nto update the language in the caption and enhancements by adding\n\nthe words \"forced labor.”\n\n             The defendants next dispute the application of the two-\n\nlevel enhancement based on the wire fraud counts.            They say that\n\nbecause the wire fraud also comprised an overt act in furtherance\n\nof the forced labor conspiracy, \"impermissible double-counting\"\n\nwould result from imposing an upward adjustment because of the wire\n\nfraud.     For this view they rely upon United States v. Sedoma, 332\n\nF.3d 20 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -22-\n\f          An event or action occurring in the course of an offense\n\ncan readily result in a separate enhancement or penalty; witness\n\nthe use of gun during a theft of drugs.            18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)\n\n(2000); see also United States v. Adams, 375 F.3d 108, 111 (1st\n\nCir. 2004).      And, from a policy standpoint, the fact that a\n\nseparate crime was committed as part of the forced labor conspiracy\n\ngives good reason for extra punishment.             Double-counting is not\n\nautomatically forbidden, see United States v. Lilly, 13 F.3d 15, 19\n\n(1st Cir. 1994), but here there was none.\n\n             Sedoma is inapposite.          In that case, the issue was\n\nwhether the same conduct (a police officer's fraud upon Rhode\n\nIsland and its police department) should result in two separate\n\nupward adjustments--once as a specific offense characteristic for\n\nabuse of a position of trust, and again as a separate offense group\n\nunder U.S.S.G. § 3D1.4.        Sedoma, 332 F.3d at 28.          Here the wire\n\nfraud counts did not result in any additional adjustment under the\n\ngrouping rules of section 3D1.4.        The concern present in Sedoma is\n\nabsent here.\n\n          Finally, Bradley and O'Dell's Blakely challenges, which\n\ncontest   both    the    constitutionality     of    the     district   court's\n\nsentencing     enhancements    and   the    validity    of     the   Guidelines\n\nthemselves,    were     forfeit,   having   been    raised    neither   in   the\n\ndistrict court nor in the defendants' initial briefs in this court.\n\nUnder governing precedent in this circuit, there was no plain error\n\n\n                                     -23-\n\fin adhering to the Guidelines, as the Supreme Court has not yet\n\ndeclared them invalid.         See United States v. Cordoza-Estrada, 385\n\nF.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir. 2004); United States v. Morgan, 384 F.3d 1,\n\n8 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n             As to the sentencing enhancements, the result would not\n\ndiffer even     if   the     Supreme   Court    ultimately     holds     that   such\n\nenhancements must be based on facts found by a jury.                   The district\n\ncourt's two \"independent findings\" upon which the enhancements\n\nrelied--the length of time Hutchinson and Flynn were held in\n\ninvoluntary    servitude      and   the   involvement     of     the    wire    fraud\n\noffenses--were       amply    supported       and   not   even     contested       at\n\nsentencing.     See Cordoza-Estrada, 385 F.3d at 59-60; Morgan, 384\n\nF.3d at 8.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -24-\n\f",

Bradley and Kathleen Mary O'Dell appeal from convictions for forced labor and related crimes. The gist of the charges was that the defendants lured Jamaican laborers to New Hampshire through fraud, mistreated them during their employ and coerced them to stay. From the evidence presented at trial, the jury could reasonably have found that the following events occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1999, Bradley and O'Dell traveled to Jamaica to recruit seasonal workers for Bradley Tree Service, a tree removal company that they operated in New Hampshire. In Jamaica, the defendants convinced two men&#8212;Livingston Wilson and Garth Clarke&#8212;to come to work for them in the United States. The men were promised wages of $15-20 per hour and lodging in one of two houses on Bradley and O'Dell's property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Wilson and Clarke arrived in New Hampshire to begin their work, they were provided a camping trailer&#8212;initially without running water, electricity or heat. Both Jamaicans were paid $7 per hour rather than the $15-20 they had been promised. At work, yells, curses and intimidation were directed at them.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> After a week, Clarke fled to New York where he received a phone call from O'Dell, who threatened to \"kick his ass\"&#8212;as well as call the police, the FBI, and the immigration service&#8212;if he did not return.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bradley stated in front of Wilson that he planned to \"take his gun and go to New York and look for [Clarke].\" After Clarke's departure, the defendants also seized Wilson's passport and plane tickets. Bradley frequently got angry and yelled at Wilson on the job site, occasionally pushing him down. Clarke never returned to New Hampshire but instead went on from New York to Jamaica. Wilson eventually returned to Jamaica when his work visa expired in October 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after Wilson's departure, the defendants again traveled to Jamaica and recruited Martin Sadler, Andrew Flynn and David Hutchinson to work for Bradley Tree Service from April to October 2001, promising each of the latter two men wages of at least $11 per hour. When the men arrived in New Hampshire, O'Dell took all three of their passports, explaining that in the previous year a worker had run away&#8212;and that Bradley would hire someone in Jamaica to \"destroy\" that man. Flynn and Hutchinson were both frightened by this statement, believing that murder for hire was quite feasible in Jamaica.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As with their predecessors, the three men were badly housed and ill-treated. They were paid $8 per hour rather than the $11 promised and were charged $50 a week in rent. When Hutchinson argued with Bradley about pay and rent, he was told that he only needed to stay and work long enough to repay $1,000 allegedly spent on his ticket&#8212;money that Hutchinson did not have. The defendants hindered the men when they sought treatment for injuries or medical care, and O'Dell kept tabs on the men's whereabouts although they traveled on their own in the neighborhood and elsewhere.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 2001, the local police visited in response to an anonymous tip that Jamaican laborers were being held against their will. When interviewed, Flynn and Hutchinson complained about their treatment; O'Dell told the officers that the men were free to leave but would have to pay for their return tickets. When the police left, Bradley browbeat the men and pushed one of them, seeking to learn who had called the police.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During this encounter Bradley grabbed Hutchinson by the neck and started to choke him. Flynn fled to a neighbor's house. O'Dell reported this to Bradley and then herself began to hit Hutchinson. After a struggle with Bradley and O'Dell, Hutchinson also fled to the neighbor's house; from there both men went to the police and spent the evening in a shelter. They remained in the United States until the time of Bradley and O'Dell's trial, working at other jobs and apparently receiving assistance from the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 2003, a federal grand jury in New Hampshire returned a 21-count indictment against Bradley and O'Dell. Counts 1-9 consisted of one count of conspiracy to commit forced labor, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 371 &amp; 1589 (2000); two counts of forced labor, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1589; two counts of attempted forced labor, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1594 (2000); two counts of trafficking into forced labor, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1590 (2000); and two counts of document servitude, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1592 (2000). These counts dealt solely with Bradley and O'Dell's treatment of Flynn and Hutchinson.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counts 10-14 were for wire fraud, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1343 (2000), arising out of the recruitment and employment of Clarke and Wilson. Counts 15-20 were for wire fraud arising out of the 2001 recruitment and employment of Flynn and Hutchinson. Count 21 charged O'Dell with making a false statement to an FBI agent regarding her role in Bradley Tree Service. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1001 (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After trial in August 2003, the jury convicted the defendants on all counts except for the false statement charge and the attempted forced labor charges (which the jury did not consider after convicting on the underlying offenses). In January 2004, the district judge sentenced Bradley and O'Dell each to 70 months' imprisonment (the bottom of the calculated Guidelines range), fined Bradley $12,500 and ordered the defendants to pay $13,052 in restitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Bradley and O'Dell contest both their convictions and their sentences. In particular, they challenge a number of alleged errors in the district court's jury instructions; the introduction of evidence regarding their treatment of Wilson and Clarke in 1999-2000; and the application of two sentencing enhancements under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2H4.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with the jury instructions. The main statute under which the defendants were charged is captioned \"Forced Labor\"; so far as relevant here, the statute makes it a criminal act for anyone \"knowingly\" to \"provide[ ] or obtain[ ] the labor or services of a person\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) by threats of serious harm to, or physical restraint against, that person or another person; [or]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) by means of any scheme, plan, or pattern intended to cause the person to believe that, if the person did not perform such labor or services, that person or another person would suffer serious harm or physical restraint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 1589.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants' first challenge is to the district court's instruction defining \"serious harm,\" which read as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The term \"serious harm\" includes both physical and non-physical types of harm. Therefore, a threat of serious harm includes any threats&#8212;includes threats of any consequences, whether physical or non-physical, that are sufficient under all of the surrounding circumstances to compel or coerce a reasonable person in the same situation to provide or to continue providing labor or services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bradley and O'Dell claim that this definition expands the meaning of serious harm beyond the limits contemplated by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1589.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1589 is a recent addition to the chapter that makes criminal acts of slavery, peonage and holding to involuntary servitude, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1581-1594 (2000). Adopted in 2000 as part of a broader set of provisions&#8212;the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, 114 Stat. 1464&#8212;section 1589 was intended expressly to counter <i>United States v. Kozminski,</i> 487 U.S. 931, 108 S.Ct. 2751, 101 L.Ed.2d 788 (1988). <i>See</i> H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 106-939, at 100-01 (2000). In <i>Kozminski</i> the Supreme Court had interpreted the pre-existing ban on \"involuntary servitude\" in section 1584 to prohibit only conduct involving the use or threatened use of <i>physical</i> or <i>legal</i> coercion. 487 U.S. at 949-52, 108 S.Ct. 2751.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In glossing the new statute, the conference report said \"serious harm\" was intended to encompass not only physical violence, but also more subtle psychological methods of coercion&#8212;\"such as where traffickers threaten harm to third persons, restrain their victims without physical violence or injury, or threaten dire consequences by means other than overt violence.\" H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 106-939, at 101. It continued: \"The term `serious harm' as used in this Act refers to a broad array of harms, including both physical and nonphysical....\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bradley and O'Dell argue that the conference report's reference to \"dire consequences\" stands in sharp contrast to the district court's instruction, which states that serious harm can include \"any consequences.\" They further claim that the district court's definition could apply to a broad range of innocent conduct, such as employers who legitimately convince their \"victims\" to continue working, for example, by threatening to withhold <i>future</i> pay that is sorely needed by a worker.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Starting with the <i>extent</i> of pressure, we note that Congress did not use \"dire consequences\" in the statute; it said \"serious harm\" and the district court properly charged in those words. We read the instruction's reference to \"any consequences\" as explaining that non-physical as well as physical consequences should be considered. Instructions must be read as a whole, <i>see United States v. Serino,</i> 835 F.2d 924, 930 (1st Cir.1987), and no jury, taking the above-quoted paragraph as a whole, could think that trivial consequences would suffice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do agree that the phrase \"serious harm,\" as extended to non-physical coercion, creates a potential for jury misunderstanding as to the <i>nature</i> of the pressure that is proscribed. Taken literally, Congress'\"threats\" and \"scheme\" language could be read to encompass conduct such as the employer's \"threat\" not to pay for passage home if an employee left early. Depending upon the contract, surely such a \"threat\" could be a legitimate stance for the employer and not criminal conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, in an appropriate case we think that the court in instructing the jury would be required to draw a line between improper threats or coercion and permissible warnings of adverse but legitimate consequences. However, Bradley and O'Dell do not appear to have sought any such instruction. Instead, the instructions sought so badly understated the reach of the statute that it would have been improper to have given them.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question, then, is whether the district court should as a matter of course have included qualifying language explaining that some warnings from the employer could be legitimate and to differentiate such warnings from illicit threats. Arguably, a standard instruction should embody such a caveat; it is also arguable that the caveat would be required only on evidence that might bring the case within the caveat. But we need not decide the point here because seemingly no appropriate objection was made on the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither the defendants' proffered instructions nor any prior discussion on the record suggests that defendants were seeking to exclude innocent warnings from the class of threats that would violate the statute. The defendants' only pertinent on-the-record objection was that the court had \"expanded the forced labor statute beyond its writing and incorporated areas that are not envisioned by the statute.\" Without further elaboration this does not satisfy the specificity required by Fed.R.Crim.P. 30(d), and review is available only for plain error. <i>See United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 731-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants' brief suggests that the plain error test can be avoided because of counsel's \"off-the-record\" discussion with the district judge about the instructions. If this discussion had included an objection to the \"any consequences\" language on the specific ground that the phrase required a caveat to exclude legitimate warnings (<i>e.g.,</i> of no future wages), we would be faced with three interesting issues: whether the claim of error was thereby preserved, whether on these facts there was error in omitting the caveat, and whether any such error was harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Off-the-record chambers conferences with counsel on jury instructions are not uncommon in civil cases, but are perhaps less usual in criminal ones. They are not forbidden by the Court Reporter's Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 753(b) (2000),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> although the Second Circuit has pointed out that they can create difficulties for a reviewing court, especially where any effort is made thereafter to rely on matters that allegedly took place in the off-the-record conference. <i>See Wright,</i> 569 F.2d at 1190 n. 5. Whether or not an off-the-record conference occurs, counsel remains obligated&#8212;as we have clearly held&#8212;to put requests for instructions and objections on the record. <i>United States v. Coady,</i> 809 F.2d 119, 123 (1st Cir.1987); <i>see also</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 30.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem is compounded here because the district court, in eliciting post-charge objections in the courtroom, suggested that counsel did not need to elaborate upon earlier objections already discussed off the record. If there were any suggestion that the defendants had objected to the lack of language protecting \"innocent threats\" in their earlier off-the-record conference, we could be faced with a serious difficulty, but no such suggestion is present in this case: the defendants' brief carefully <i>avoids</i> saying that trial counsel raised such a specific objection in chambers, and the evidence and closing arguments do not suggest that a caveat regarding \"innocent threats\" had been sought.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was no plain error here. No evidence was offered at trial that the defendants made \"legitimate\" threats, so there is no risk that the jury convicted them for such threats. The defendants' arguable threats or coercion involved the taking of passports and mentions of violence, combined with what the jury could have found to be complementary scrutiny of, or restrictions on, the victims' local travel. So even if the instruction was overbroad, it did not \"likely\" affect the outcome or threaten a miscarriage of justice, as plain error doctrine requires. <i>See United States v. Sotomayor-Vazquez,</i> 249 F.3d 1, 19 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bradley and O'Dell also claim that the district court's instructions adopted an overly subjective test for whether Hutchinson and Flynn felt compelled to work by the defendants' actions. In particular, they point to the following statement:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You may also consider Mr. Hutchinson's and Mr. Flynn's special vulnerabilities, if any. In this regard you may consider whether or not all persons are of the same courage or firmness. You may consider, for example, Mr. Hutchinson's and Mr. Flynn's background, physical and mental condition, experience, education, socioeconomic status, and any inequalities between Mr. Hutchinson and Mr. Flynn and the defendants with respect to these considerations, including their relative stations in life. You may consider and weigh whether or not Mr. Hutchinson and Mr. Flynn were vulnerable in some way so that the actions of the defendant, even if not sufficient to compel another person to work, were enough to compel Mr. Hutchinson and Mr. Flynn to work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This and the rest of the defendants' remaining claims of instructional error are also subject to only plain error review for the reason described above, but as to each we find no error at all, plain or otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The test of undue pressure is an objective one, asking how a reasonable employee would have behaved; to rely upon some hidden emotional flaw or weakness unknown to the employer would raise various problems (<i>e.g.,</i> scienter). But, as the defendants concede, known objective conditions that make the victim especially vulnerable to pressure (such as youth or immigrant status) bear on whether the employee's labor was \"obtain[ed]\" by forbidden means. <i>See</i> H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 106-939, at 101; <i>see also Kozminski,</i> 487 U.S. at 952, 108 S.Ct. 2751; <i>United States v. Alzanki,</i> 54 F.3d 994, 1000-01 (1st Cir.1995), <i>cert. denied,</i> 516 U.S. 1111, 116 S.Ct. 909, 133 L.Ed.2d 841 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed with the rest of the charge, the district court's instruction makes clear that any fear of serious harm on the part of Hutchinson or Flynn needed to be reasonable for an individual with his special vulnerabilities.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Nor did the evidence or arguments indicate that there were, or that the jury should consider, any peculiar vulnerabilities of the victims not fairly apparent from their objective circumstances (immigrant status, lack of local ties). There is also no indication that the defendants asked for an instruction to deal with hidden vulnerabilities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bradley and O'Dell's third objection is to the district court's instruction on Hutchinson and Flynn's opportunity to flee, which read:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government ... need not prove physical restraint; such as, the use of chains, barbed wire, or locked doors, in order to establish the offense of forced labor. The fact that Mr. Hutchinson or Mr. Flynn may have had an opportunity to flee is not determinative of the question of forced labor if either or both of the defendants placed Mr. Hutchinson or Mr. Flynn in such fear or circumstances that he did not reasonably believe he could leave.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pointing to the Eleventh Circuit's pattern jury instructions for involuntary servitude, the defendants claim that the opportunity to flee is determinative of forced labor&#8212;and that the district court's instruction once again erroneously replaces objective analysis with a subjective standard for coercion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Eleventh Circuit's pattern instruction is not in conflict with the charge just quoted; it tells the jury to \"consider... any reasonable means the person may have had to escape\" in deciding whether the person reasonably believed that he was being compelled to serve. <i>Eleventh Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions (Criminal Cases) 2003</i> at 365. We see nothing wrong with the pattern instruction; but the defendants did not ask for the pattern instruction and the language that the court used in this case is not erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants' fourth objection is to the district court's instruction on the payment of wages to victims:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[W]hether a person is paid a salary or a wage is not determinative of the question of whether that person has been held in forced labor. In other words, if a person is compelled to labor against his will by any one of the means prohibited by the forced labor statute, such service is forced, even if he is paid or compensated for the work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Noting that Hutchinson and Flynn were both paid above the minimum wage, Bradley and O'Dell claim that the district court should have instructed the jury to consider whether payment of wages was the reason for the victims' decision to work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once again, the instruction given is correct. The defendants were free to ask for their own version as a complement to the charge given but they did not. Of course, they were free to argue to the jury (as they did) that the reason the victims remained was because of pay rather than threats. The charge as a whole made amply clear that the defendants could be convicted only if their threats and abusive conduct reasonably coerced or forced Flynn or Hutchinson to provide labor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn next to an entirely separate claim of error. Over the course of the eight-day trial, slightly over one day of testimony concerned the defendants' treatment of Wilson and Clarke. This included their recruitment by the defendants, their experience at the defendants' hands, and Clarke's flight and the subsequent seizure of Wilson's passport. On this appeal, the defendants claim that the testimony was irrelevant, prejudicial and comprised forbidden character evidence. Fed R. Evid. 401, 403, 404.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence of the recruitment, low wages and bad housing of Wilson and Clarke was plainly relevant to the charges in the indictment that the defendants had defrauded both men. However, no forced labor counts were based upon their treatment, <i>see</i> note 2 above. Thus one might fairly ask why certain portions of the testimony as to Wilson and Clarke were relevant&#8212;specifically, those parts concerning verbal abuse, the apparent indifference to Wilson and Clarke's medical needs, and the circumstances of Clarke's flight.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidence of prior bad acts to show bad character, and so a propensity to commit crimes, is forbidden for reasons of policy; but prior bad acts that are otherwise specially relevant are still permitted so long as prejudice does not substantially outweigh probative value. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 403, 404; <i>United States v. Van Horn,</i> 277 F.3d 48, 57 (1st Cir.2002). Unfortunately for the defendants, most of the key evidence of the treatment of Wilson and Clarke is relevant to the forced labor charges concerning Flynn and Hutchinson&#8212;independent of the forbidden inferences as to the defendants' character.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is assuredly so of what is the most damaging evidence&#8212;that Clarke fled, was pursued by threats, and that Wilson's passport was then seized. These circumstances give a malign motive for, and provide the context of, the later seizure of Flynn and Hutchinson's passports and of the initial threat made to them based on Bradley's supposed intention to \"destroy\" a former worker. Motive evidence is a settled exception to Rule 404's general ban. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 404(b); <i>United States v. Cintolo,</i> 818 F.2d 980, 1000 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 484 U.S. 913, 108 S.Ct. 259, 98 L.Ed.2d 216 (1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The abusive treatment of Wilson and Clarke, apart from their bad housing, is closer to the margin. A showing of bad acts is permitted to demonstrate a defendant's intent or plan, <i>see, e.g., United States v. Spinosa,</i> 982 F.2d 620, 628 (1st Cir.1992); <i>United States v. Wood,</i> 924 F.2d 399, 401 (1st Cir.1991), and the intimidation of Wilson and Clarke, including their isolation from medical care, was arguably part of a pattern of intimidation that carried over to Flynn and Hutchinson. Yet bad acts comprising most criminal careers form a pattern so, taken too broadly, the exception could be made to swallow the rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because none of the laborers was held in formal captivity, the government in this case faced inevitable doubts as to whether the defendants were merely abusive employers or deliberately sought to compel forced labor. Arguably the defendants' prior treatment of Wilson and Clarke, so far as it showed efforts to intimidate them and minimize their outside contact, tended to reinforce the inference that the later, similar treatment of Flynn and Hutchinson was part of a deliberate scheme to hold laborers by intimidation. There is certainly precedent for such reasoning.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The main issue, then, is not relevance (over and above propensity) but how much prejudice was added by the less necessary detail as to the abuse suffered by Wilson and Clarke. For the most part, it was not different than the treatment meted out to Flynn and Hutchinson and so was unlikely to inflame the jury. And, of course, Rules 403 and 404 weigh the decision in the government's favor by saying that evidence is excluded only if probative value is substantially outweighed by prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note, finally, that the judge gave the customary limiting instruction. Without being naive about the effect of such instructions, they are still worth something&#8212;especially where, as here, the fairly debatable evidence had at least some relevance and was not dramatically prejudicial. <i>See Van Horn,</i> 277 F.3d at 58-59. Perhaps more pruning would have been suitable, but on close calls of this kind we will not interfere with the district judge's reasonable judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the last set of issues in the case, which relate to sentencing. The district court used the 2003 edition of the guidelines and sentenced Bradley and O'Dell under the provisions of U.S.S.G. &#167; 2H4.1, captioned \"Peonage, Involuntary Servitude, and Slave Trade.\" The base offense level for this offense as to either victim was 22 and, under the grouping rules, this trumped the lower levels generated by the fraud offenses against Flynn and Hutchinson. U.S.S.G. &#167; 3D1.3(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Offense-specific enhancements added three more levels&#8212;one level because Flynn and Hutchinson had been held for more than 30 days, U.S.S.G. &#167; 2H4.1(b)(3)(C), and two levels more because another felony (here, fraud) had been committed in connection with the main offense. U.S.S.G. &#167; 2H4.1(b)(4)(A). These enhancements, which raised the offense level from 22 to 25, are the subject of the defendants' remaining claims of error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that the crimes were committed against <i>two</i> victims&#8212;Flynn and Hutchinson&#8212;doubled the number of crimes but does not double the final offense level; instead, it results, in this case, in an upward adjustment of two more levels under the table provided by U.S.S.G. &#167; 3D1.4, yielding a combined final offense level of 27 for each defendant. The defendants' convictions for defrauding Wilson and Clarke generated no additional upward adjustment. With criminal history categories of I, both Bradley and O'Dell were sentenced to 70 months' imprisonment&#8212;the bottom of the applicable Guidelines range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Bradley and O'Dell contest the application of the guidelines on two substantive grounds: first, that the enhancements under 2H4.1(b)(3) and (4) are not intended to apply to forced labor offenses; and second, that 2H4.1(b)(4)'s enhancement for the related commission of wire fraud constitutes an impermissible \"double-counting\" of their conduct. The defendants also say that <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), renders the Guidelines&#8212;and in particular the enhancements&#8212;unconstitutional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The caption of section 2H4.1 and some of its internal language refer to \"peonage\" and \"involuntary servitude\" but not forced labor. The defendants concede that the section itself does encompass forced labor under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1589&#8212;and Guideline Amendment 627 (Nov. 1, 2001) so declares&#8212;but they point out that the guideline clauses imposing enhancements for length of time and commission of another offense refer explicitly to peonage and involuntary servitude and were never amended to refer to forced labor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite some initial appeal, the defendants' literal language argument is undermined by an understanding of the history and the underlying policy objectives of Congress and the Sentencing Commission. In the 2000 statutory amendment adding forced labor as an offense, Congress' premise was that the Supreme Court had mistakenly narrowed the definition of involuntary servitude by limiting to it physical coercion. Indeed, the Senate bill handled the matter by redefining and enlarging the offense of involuntary servitude. <i>See</i> S. Amend. 4027, 106th Cong. &#167; 12 (2000); S. Amend. 4028, 106th Cong. &#167; 12 (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately Congress adopted the House format for remedying <i>Kozminski</i> by creating a new forced labor offense. <i>See</i> H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 106-939, at 99-101. But this new nomenclature does not alter the fact that Congress thought of forced labor as a <i>species</i> of involuntary servitude. Indeed, the 2000 statute made other changes to Title 22 of the U.S.Code that make this crystal clear. It there described \"involuntary servitude\" in the same terms used for the new \"forced labor\" offense, calling the former:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a condition of servitude induced by means of ... any scheme, plan, or pattern intended to cause a person to believe that, if the person did not enter into or continue in such condition, that person or another person would suffer serious harm or physical restraint....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, &#167; 103(5), 114 Stat. at 1469 (codified at 22 U.S.C. &#167; 7102(5) (2000)). Similarly, the Act's purposes state that \"[i]nvoluntary servitude statutes are intended to reach cases in which persons are held in a condition of servitude through nonviolent coercion.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 102(13), 114 Stat. at 1467 (codified at 22 U.S.C. &#167; 7101(b)(13) (2000)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, Congress' evident purpose, properly attributed to the Commission, was to treat forced labor as a form of involuntary servitude. It follows that an enhancement applicable to the latter reaches the former&#8212;just as section 2H4.1 of the Guidelines embraces \"forced labor\" despite its narrower caption (\"Peonage, Involuntary Servitude, and Slave Trade\"). Against this background, the defendants place too much reliance on the Commission's failure to update the language in the caption and enhancements by adding the words \"forced labor.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants next dispute the application of the two-level enhancement based on the wire fraud counts. They say that because the wire fraud also comprised an overt act in furtherance of the forced labor conspiracy, \"impermissible double-counting\" would result from imposing an upward adjustment because of the wire fraud. For this view they rely upon <i>United States v. Sedoma,</i> 332 F.3d 20 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An event or action occurring in the course of an offense can readily result in a separate enhancement or penalty; witness the use of a gun during a theft of drugs. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(A) (2000); <i>see also United States v. Adams,</i> 375 F.3d 108, 111 (1st Cir.2004). And, from a policy standpoint, the fact that a separate crime was committed as part of the forced labor conspiracy gives good reason for extra punishment. Double-counting is not automatically forbidden, <i>see United States v. Lilly,</i> 13 F.3d 15, 19 (1st Cir.1994), but here there was none.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Sedoma</i> is inapposite. In that case, the issue was whether the same conduct (a police officer's fraud upon Rhode Island and its police department) should result in two separate upward adjustments&#8212;once as a specific offense characteristic for abuse of a position of trust, and again as a separate offense group under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3D1.4. <i>Sedoma,</i> 332 F.3d at 28. Here the wire fraud counts did not result in any additional adjustment under the grouping rules of section 3D1.4. The concern present in <i>Sedoma</i> is absent here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Bradley and O'Dell's <i>Blakely</i> challenges, which contest both the constitutionality of the district court's sentencing enhancements and the validity of the Guidelines themselves, were forfeit, having been raised neither in the district court nor in the defendants' initial briefs in this court. Under governing precedent in this circuit, there was no plain error in adhering to the Guidelines, as the Supreme Court has not yet declared them invalid. <i>See United States v. Cordoza-Estrada,</i> 385 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.2004); <i>United States v. Morgan,</i> 384 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the sentencing enhancements, the result would not differ even if the Supreme Court ultimately holds that such enhancements must be based on facts found by a jury. The district court's two \"independent findings\" upon which the enhancements relied&#8212;the length of time Hutchinson and Flynn were held in involuntary servitude and the involvement of the wire fraud offenses&#8212;were amply supported and not even contested at sentencing. <i>See Cordoza-Estrada,</i> 385 F.3d at 59-60; <i>Morgan,</i> 384 F.3d at 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> There was also evidence that Bradley was indifferent to injuries of the two men, failing to take them for doctor or hospital care when seemingly required.

Bradley and Kathleen Mary O'Dell appeal from convictions for forced labor and related crimes. The gist of the charges was that the defendants lured Jamaican laborers to New Hampshire through fraud, mistreated them during their employ and coerced them to stay. From the evidence presented at trial, the jury could reasonably have found that the following events occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1999, Bradley and O'Dell traveled to Jamaica to recruit seasonal workers for Bradley Tree Service, a tree removal company that they operated in New Hampshire. In Jamaica, the defendants convinced two men&#8212;Livingston Wilson and Garth Clarke&#8212;to come to work for them in the United States. The men were promised wages of $15-20 per hour and lodging in one of two houses on Bradley and O'Dell's property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Wilson and Clarke arrived in New Hampshire to begin their work, they were provided a camping trailer&#8212;initially without running water, electricity or heat. Both Jamaicans were paid $7 per hour rather than the $15-20 they had been promised. At work, yells, curses and intimidation were directed at them.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> After a week, Clarke fled to New York where he received a phone call from O'Dell, who threatened to \"kick his ass\"&#8212;as well as call the police, the FBI, and the immigration service&#8212;if he did not return.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bradley stated in front of Wilson that he planned to \"take his gun and go to New York and look for [Clarke].\" After Clarke's departure, the defendants also seized Wilson's passport and plane tickets. Bradley frequently got angry and yelled at Wilson on the job site, occasionally pushing him down. Clarke never returned to New Hampshire but instead went on from New York to Jamaica. Wilson eventually returned to Jamaica when his work visa expired in October 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after Wilson's departure, the defendants again traveled to Jamaica and recruited Martin Sadler, Andrew Flynn and David Hutchinson to work for Bradley Tree Service from April to October 2001, promising each of the latter two men wages of at least $11 per hour. When the men arrived in New Hampshire, O'Dell took all three of their passports, explaining that in the previous year a worker had run away&#8212;and that Bradley would hire someone in Jamaica to \"destroy\" that man. Flynn and Hutchinson were both frightened by this statement, believing that murder for hire was quite feasible in Jamaica.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As with their predecessors, the three men were badly housed and ill-treated. They were paid $8 per hour rather than the $11 promised and were charged $50 a week in rent. When Hutchinson argued with Bradley about pay and rent, he was told that he only needed to stay and work long enough to repay $1,000 allegedly spent on his ticket&#8212;money that Hutchinson did not have. The defendants hindered the men when they sought treatment for injuries or medical care, and O'Dell kept tabs on the men's whereabouts although they traveled on their own in the neighborhood and elsewhere.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 2001, the local police visited in response to an anonymous tip that Jamaican laborers were being held against their will. When interviewed, Flynn and Hutchinson complained about their treatment; O'Dell told the officers that the men were free to leave but would have to pay for their return tickets. When the police left, Bradley browbeat the men and pushed one of them, seeking to learn who had called the police.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During this encounter Bradley grabbed Hutchinson by the neck and started to choke him. Flynn fled to a neighbor's house. O'Dell reported this to Bradley and then herself began to hit Hutchinson. After a struggle with Bradley and O'Dell, Hutchinson also fled to the neighbor's house; from there both men went to the police and spent the evening in a shelter. They remained in the United States until the time of Bradley and O'Dell's trial, working at other jobs and apparently receiving assistance from the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 2003, a federal grand jury in New Hampshire returned a 21-count indictment against Bradley and O'Dell. Counts 1-9 consisted of one count of conspiracy to commit forced labor, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 371 &amp; 1589 (2000); two counts of forced labor, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1589; two counts of attempted forced labor, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1594 (2000); two counts of trafficking into forced labor, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1590 (2000); and two counts of document servitude, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1592 (2000).

Counts 15-20 were for wire fraud arising out of the 2001 recruitment and employment of Flynn and Hutchinson.

Conf. Rep. No. 106-939, at 101. It continued: \"The term `serious harm' as used in this Act refers to a broad array of harms, including both physical and nonphysical....\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bradley and O'Dell argue that the conference report's reference to \"dire consequences\" stands in sharp contrast to the district court's instruction, which states that serious harm can include \"any consequences.\" They further claim that the district court's definition could apply to a broad range of innocent conduct, such as employers who legitimately convince their \"victims\" to continue working, for example, by threatening to withhold <i>future</i> pay that is sorely needed by a worker.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Starting with the <i>extent</i> of pressure, we note that Congress did not use \"dire consequences\" in the statute; it said \"serious harm\" and the district court properly charged in those words. We read the instruction's reference to \"any consequences\" as explaining that non-physical as well as physical consequences should be considered. Instructions must be read as a whole, <i>see United States v. Serino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"499044\"><a href=\"/opinion/499044/united-states-v-dominic-l-serino-united-states-of-america-v-john-l/\"><span class=\"volume\">835</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">924</span></a></span>, 930 (1st Cir.1987), and no jury, taking the above-quoted paragraph as a whole, could think that trivial consequences would suffice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do agree that the phrase \"serious harm,\" as extended to non-physical coercion, creates a potential for jury misunderstanding as to the <i>nature</i> of the pressure that is proscribed. Taken literally, Congress'\"threats\" and \"scheme\" language could be read to encompass conduct such as the employer's \"threat\" not to pay for passage home if an employee left early. Depending upon the contract, surely such a \"threat\" could be a legitimate stance for the employer and not criminal conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, in an appropriate case we think that the court in instructing the jury would be required to draw a line between improper threats or coercion and permissible warnings of adverse but legitimate consequences. However, Bradley and O'Dell do not appear to have sought any such instruction. Instead, the instructions sought so badly understated the reach of the statute that it would have been improper to have given them.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question, then, is whether the district court should as a matter of course have included qualifying language explaining that some warnings from the employer could be legitimate and to differentiate such warnings from illicit threats. Arguably, a standard instruction should embody such a caveat; it is also arguable that the caveat would be required only on evidence that might bring the case within the caveat. But we need not decide the point here because seemingly no appropriate objection was made on the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither the defendants' proffered instructions nor any prior discussion on the record suggests that defendants were seeking to exclude innocent warnings from the class of threats that would violate the statute. The defendants' only pertinent on-the-record objection was that the court had \"expanded the forced labor statute beyond its writing and incorporated areas that are not envisioned by the statute.\" Without further elaboration this does not satisfy the specificity required by Fed.R.Crim.P. 30(d), and review is available only for plain error. <i>See United States v. Olano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span>, 731-37, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

If this discussion had included an objection to the \"any consequences\" language on the specific ground that the phrase required a caveat to exclude legitimate warnings (<i>e.g.,</i> of no future wages), we would be faced with three interesting issues: whether the claim of error was thereby preserved, whether on these facts there was error in omitting the caveat, and whether any such error was harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Off-the-record chambers conferences with counsel on jury instructions are not uncommon in civil cases, but are perhaps less usual in criminal ones. They are not forbidden by the Court Reporter's Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 753(b) (2000),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> although the Second Circuit has pointed out that they can create difficulties for a reviewing court, especially where any effort is made thereafter to rely on matters that allegedly took place in the off-the-record conference. <i>See Wright,</i> 569 F.2d at 1190 n. 5. Whether or not an off-the-record conference occurs, counsel remains obligated&#8212;as we have clearly held&#8212;to put requests for instructions and objections on the record. <i>United States v. Coady,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"481634\"><a href=\"/opinion/481634/united-states-v-neil-patrick-coady/\"><span class=\"volume\">809</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">119</span></a></span>, 123 (1st Cir.1987); <i>see also</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 30.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem is compounded here because the district court, in eliciting post-charge objections in the courtroom, suggested that counsel did not need to elaborate upon earlier objections already discussed off the record. If there were any suggestion that the defendants had objected to the lack of language protecting \"innocent threats\" in their earlier off-the-record conference, we could be faced with a serious difficulty, but no such suggestion is present in this case: the defendants' brief carefully <i>avoids</i> saying that trial counsel raised such a specific objection in chambers, and the evidence and closing arguments do not suggest that a caveat regarding \"innocent threats\" had been sought.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was no plain error here. No evidence was offered at trial that the defendants made \"legitimate\" threats, so there is no risk that the jury convicted them for such threats. The defendants' arguable threats or coercion involved the taking of passports and mentions of violence, combined with what the jury could have found to be complementary scrutiny of, or restrictions on, the victims' local travel. So even if the instruction was overbroad, it did not \"likely\" affect the outcome or threaten a miscarriage of justice, as plain error doctrine requires. <i>See United States v. Sotomayor-Vazquez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199390\"><a href=\"/opinion/199390/united-states-v-sotomayor-vazquez/\"><span class=\"volume\">249</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 19 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bradley and O'Dell also claim that the district court's instructions adopted an overly subjective test for whether Hutchinson and Flynn felt compelled to work by the defendants' actions. In particular, they point to the following statement:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You may also consider Mr. Hutchinson's and Mr. Flynn's special vulnerabilities, if any. In this regard you may consider whether or not all persons are of the same courage or firmness. You may consider, for example, Mr. Hutchinson's and Mr. Flynn's background, physical and mental condition, experience, education, socioeconomic status, and any inequalities between Mr. Hutchinson and Mr. Flynn and the defendants with respect to these considerations, including their relative stations in life. You may consider and weigh whether or not Mr. Hutchinson and Mr. Flynn were vulnerable in some way so that the actions of the defendant, even if not sufficient to compel another person to work, were enough to compel Mr. Hutchinson and Mr. Flynn to work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This and the rest of the defendants' remaining claims of instructional error are also subject to only plain error review for the reason described above, but as to each we find no error at all, plain or otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The test of undue pressure is an objective one, asking how a reasonable employee would have behaved; to rely upon some hidden emotional flaw or weakness unknown to the employer would raise various problems (<i>e.g.,</i> scienter). But, as the defendants concede, known objective conditions that make the victim especially vulnerable to pressure (such as youth or immigrant status) bear on whether the employee's labor was \"obtain[ed]\" by forbidden means. <i>See</i> H.R.

The fact that Mr. Hutchinson or Mr. Flynn may have had an opportunity to flee is not determinative of the question of forced labor if either or both of the defendants placed Mr. Hutchinson or Mr. Flynn in such fear or circumstances that he did not reasonably believe he could leave.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pointing to the Eleventh Circuit's pattern jury instructions for involuntary servitude, the defendants claim that the opportunity to flee is determinative of forced labor&#8212;and that the district court's instruction once again erroneously replaces objective analysis with a subjective standard for coercion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Eleventh Circuit's pattern instruction is not in conflict with the charge just quoted; it tells the jury to \"consider... any reasonable means the person may have had to escape\" in deciding whether the person reasonably believed that he was being compelled to serve. <i>Eleventh Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions (Criminal Cases) 2003</i> at 365. We see nothing wrong with the pattern instruction; but the defendants did not ask for the pattern instruction and the language that the court used in this case is not erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants' fourth objection is to the district court's instruction on the payment of wages to victims:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[W]hether a person is paid a salary or a wage is not determinative of the question of whether that person has been held in forced labor. In other words, if a person is compelled to labor against his will by any one of the means prohibited by the forced labor statute, such service is forced, even if he is paid or compensated for the work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Noting that Hutchinson and Flynn were both paid above the minimum wage, Bradley and O'Dell claim that the district court should have instructed the jury to consider whether payment of wages was the reason for the victims' decision to work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once again, the instruction given is correct. The defendants were free to ask for their own version as a complement to the charge given but they did not. Of course, they were free to argue to the jury (as they did) that the reason the victims remained was because of pay rather than threats. The charge as a whole made amply clear that the defendants could be convicted only if their threats and abusive conduct reasonably coerced or forced Flynn or Hutchinson to provide labor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn next to an entirely separate claim of error. Over the course of the eight-day trial, slightly over one day of testimony concerned the defendants' treatment of Wilson and Clarke. This included their recruitment by the defendants, their experience at the defendants' hands, and Clarke's flight and the subsequent seizure of Wilson's passport. On this appeal, the defendants claim that the testimony was irrelevant, prejudicial and comprised forbidden character evidence. Fed R. Evid. 401, 403, 404.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence of the recruitment, low wages and bad housing of Wilson and Clarke was plainly relevant to the charges in the indictment that the defendants had defrauded both men. However, no forced labor counts were based upon their treatment, <i>see</i> note 2 above. Thus one might fairly ask why certain portions of the testimony as to Wilson and Clarke were relevant&#8212;specifically, those parts concerning verbal abuse, the apparent indifference to Wilson and Clarke's medical needs, and the circumstances of Clarke's flight.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidence of prior bad acts to show bad character, and so a propensity to commit crimes, is forbidden for reasons of policy; but prior bad acts that are otherwise specially relevant are still permitted so long as prejudice does not substantially outweigh probative value. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 403, 404; <i>United States v. Van Horn,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199777\"><a href=\"/opinion/199777/united-states-v-horn/\"><span class=\"volume\">277</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></a></span>, 57 (1st Cir.2002). Unfortunately for the defendants, most of the key evidence of the treatment of Wilson and Clarke is relevant to the forced labor charges concerning Flynn and Hutchinson&#8212;independent of the forbidden inferences as to the defendants' character.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is assuredly so of what is the most damaging evidence&#8212;that Clarke fled, was pursued by threats, and that Wilson's passport was then seized. These circumstances give a malign motive for, and provide the context of, the later seizure of Flynn and Hutchinson's passports and of the initial threat made to them based on Bradley's supposed intention to \"destroy\" a former worker. Motive evidence is a settled exception to Rule 404's general ban. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 404(b); <i>United States v.

A showing of bad acts is permitted to demonstrate a defendant's intent or plan, <i>see, e.g., United States v. Spinosa,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597409\"><a href=\"/opinion/597409/united-states-v-vincent-d-spinosa/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">620</span></a></span>, 628 (1st Cir.1992); <i>United States v.

Yet bad acts comprising most criminal careers form a pattern so, taken too broadly, the exception could be made to swallow the rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because none of the laborers was held in formal captivity, the government in this case faced inevitable doubts as to whether the defendants were merely abusive employers or deliberately sought to compel forced labor. Arguably the defendants' prior treatment of Wilson and Clarke, so far as it showed efforts to intimidate them and minimize their outside contact, tended to reinforce the inference that the later, similar treatment of Flynn and Hutchinson was part of a deliberate scheme to hold laborers by intimidation. There is certainly precedent for such reasoning.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The main issue, then, is not relevance (over and above propensity) but how much prejudice was added by the less necessary detail as to the abuse suffered by Wilson and Clarke. For the most part, it was not different than the treatment meted out to Flynn and Hutchinson and so was unlikely to inflame the jury. And, of course, Rules 403 and 404 weigh the decision in the government's favor by saying that evidence is excluded only if probative value is substantially outweighed by prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note, finally, that the judge gave the customary limiting instruction. Without being naive about the effect of such instructions, they are still worth something&#8212;especially where, as here, the fairly debatable evidence had at least some relevance and was not dramatically prejudicial. <i>See Van Horn,</i> 277 F.3d at 58-59. Perhaps more pruning would have been suitable, but on close calls of this kind we will not interfere with the district judge's reasonable judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the last set of issues in the case, which relate to sentencing. The district court used the 2003 edition of the guidelines and sentenced Bradley and O'Dell under the provisions of U.S.S.G. &#167; 2H4.1, captioned \"Peonage, Involuntary Servitude, and Slave Trade.\" The base offense level for this offense as to either victim was 22 and, under the grouping rules, this trumped the lower levels generated by the fraud offenses against Flynn and Hutchinson. U.S.S.G. &#167; 3D1.3(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Offense-specific enhancements added three more levels&#8212;one level because Flynn and Hutchinson had been held for more than 30 days, U.S.S.G. &#167; 2H4.1(b)(3)(C), and two levels more because another felony (here, fraud) had been committed in connection with the main offense. U.S.S.G. &#167; 2H4.1(b)(4)(A). These enhancements, which raised the offense level from 22 to 25, are the subject of the defendants' remaining claims of error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that the crimes were committed against <i>two</i> victims&#8212;Flynn and Hutchinson&#8212;doubled the number of crimes but does not double the final offense level; instead, it results, in this case, in an upward adjustment of two more levels under the table provided by U.S.S.G. &#167; 3D1.4, yielding a combined final offense level of 27 for each defendant. The defendants' convictions for defrauding Wilson and Clarke generated no additional upward adjustment. With criminal history categories of I, both Bradley and O'Dell were sentenced to 70 months' imprisonment&#8212;the bottom of the applicable Guidelines range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Bradley and O'Dell contest the application of the guidelines on two substantive grounds: first, that the enhancements under 2H4.1(b)(3) and (4) are not intended to apply to forced labor offenses; and second, that 2H4.1(b)(4)'s enhancement for the related commission of wire fraud constitutes an impermissible \"double-counting\" of their conduct. The defendants also say that <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136995\"><a href=\"/opinion/136995/blakely-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2531</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136995\"><a href=\"/opinion/136995/blakely-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">403</span></a></span> (2004), renders the Guidelines&#8212;and in particular the enhancements&#8212;unconstitutional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The caption of section 2H4.1 and some of its internal language refer to \"peonage\" and \"involuntary servitude\" but not forced labor. The defendants concede that the section itself does encompass forced labor under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1589&#8212;and Guideline Amendment 627 (Nov. 1, 2001) so declares&#8212;but they point out that the guideline clauses imposing enhancements for length of time and commission of another offense refer explicitly to peonage and involuntary servitude and were never amended to refer to forced labor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite some initial appeal, the defendants' literal language argument is undermined by an understanding of the history and the underlying policy objectives of Congress and the Sentencing Commission. In the 2000 statutory amendment adding forced labor as an offense, Congress' premise was that the Supreme Court had mistakenly narrowed the definition of involuntary servitude by limiting to it physical coercion. Indeed, the Senate bill handled the matter by redefining and enlarging the offense of involuntary servitude. <i>See</i> S. Amend. 4027, 106th Cong. &#167; 12 (2000); S. Amend. 4028, 106th Cong. &#167; 12 (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately Congress adopted the House format for remedying <i>Kozminski</i> by creating a new forced labor offense. <i>See</i> H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 106-939, at 99-101. But this new nomenclature does not alter the fact that Congress thought of forced labor as a <i>species</i> of involuntary servitude. Indeed, the 2000 statute made other changes to Title 22 of the U.S.Code that make this crystal clear. It there described \"involuntary servitude\" in the same terms used for the new \"forced labor\" offense, calling the former:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a condition of servitude induced by means of ... any scheme, plan, or pattern intended to cause a person to believe that, if the person did not enter into or continue in such condition, that person or another person would suffer serious harm or physical restraint....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, &#167; 103(5), 114 Stat. at 1469 (codified at 22 U.S.C. &#167; 7102(5) (2000)). Similarly, the Act's purposes state that \"[i]nvoluntary servitude statutes are intended to reach cases in which persons are held in a condition of servitude through nonviolent coercion.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 102(13), 114 Stat. at 1467 (codified at 22 U.S.C. &#167; 7101(b)(13) (2000)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, Congress' evident purpose, properly attributed to the Commission, was to treat forced labor as a form of involuntary servitude. It follows that an enhancement applicable to the latter reaches the former&#8212;just as section 2H4.1 of the Guidelines embraces \"forced labor\" despite its narrower caption (\"Peonage, Involuntary Servitude, and Slave Trade\"). Against this background, the defendants place too much reliance on the Commission's failure to update the language in the caption and enhancements by adding the words \"forced labor.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants next dispute the application of the two-level enhancement based on the wire fraud counts. They say that because the wire fraud also comprised an overt act in furtherance of the forced labor conspiracy, \"impermissible double-counting\" would result from imposing an upward adjustment because of the wire fraud. For this view they rely upon <i>United States v. Sedoma,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200501\"><a href=\"/opinion/200501/united-states-v-sedoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">332</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An event or action occurring in the course of an offense can readily result in a separate enhancement or penalty; witness the use of a gun during a theft of drugs. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(A) (2000); <i>see also United States v. Adams,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201128\"><a href=\"/opinion/201128/united-states-v-adams/\"><span class=\"volume\">375</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">108</span></a></span>, 111 (1st Cir.2004). And, from a policy standpoint, the fact that a separate crime was committed as part of the forced labor conspiracy gives good reason for extra punishment. Double-counting is not automatically forbidden, <i>see United States v. Lilly,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195133\"><a href=\"/opinion/195133/united-states-v-lilly/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 19 (1st Cir.1994), but here there was none.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Sedoma</i> is inapposite. In that case, the issue was whether the same conduct (a police officer's fraud upon Rhode Island and its police department) should result in two separate upward adjustments&#8212;once as a specific offense characteristic for abuse of a position of trust, and again as a separate offense group under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3D1.4. <i>Sedoma,</i> 332 F.3d at 28. Here the wire fraud counts did not result in any additional adjustment under the grouping rules of section 3D1.4. The concern present in <i>Sedoma</i> is absent here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Bradley and O'Dell's <i>Blakely</i> challenges, which contest both the constitutionality of the district court's sentencing enhancements and the validity of the Guidelines themselves, were forfeit, having been raised neither in the district court nor in the defendants' initial briefs in this court. Under governing precedent in this circuit, there was no plain error in adhering to the Guidelines, as the Supreme Court has not yet declared them invalid. <i>See United States v. Cordoza-Estrada,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201261\"><a href=\"/opinion/201261/united-states-v-cordoza-estrada/\"><span class=\"volume\">385</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 60 (1st Cir.2004); <i>United States v.

The district court's two \"independent findings\" upon which the enhancements relied&#8212;the length of time Hutchinson and Flynn were held in involuntary servitude and the involvement of the wire fraud offenses&#8212;were amply supported and not even contested at sentencing. <i>See Cordoza-Estrada,</i> 385 F.3d at 59-60; <i>Morgan,</i> 384 F.3d at 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> There was also evidence that Bradley was indifferent to injuries of the two men, failing to take them for doctor or hospital care when seemingly required.
