App. P. 43(c)(2).\n\f            TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.             Petitioner Víctor Aguilar-\n\nOsores appeals a decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals\n\n(\"BIA\") affirming an Immigration Judge's denial of his motion to\n\nreopen removal proceedings.           We affirm.\n\n                                I.    Background\n\n            Aguilar-Osores, a native and citizen of Peru, entered the\n\nUnited   States   at   Miami,      Florida,      on   October    4,   1996,   as   a\n\nnonimmigrant with authorization to remain in the United States\n\nuntil January 3, 1997.             On June 4, 2001, the Immigration and\n\nNaturalization Service (\"INS\")1 issued a Notice to Appear, charging\n\nAguilar-Osores    with      removability      under    §   237(a)(1)(B)      of   the\n\nImmigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B),\n\nfor overstaying his visa.\n\n            In written pleadings on November 20, 2002, Aguilar-\n\nOsores, through his counsel John Loscocco (\"Loscocco\"), admitted\n\nthe factual allegations against him, conceded removability, and\n\nrequested    relief    in    the     form   of   voluntary      departure.        The\n\nImmigration Judge granted Aguilar-Osores's request for voluntary\n\ndeparture until March 20, 2003. Aguilar-Osores failed to depart by\n\nthat date, and on August 27, 2003, the Department of Homeland\n\nSecurity arrested him.\n\n\n1\n    In March 2003, the relevant functions of the INS were\ntransferred into the new Department of Homeland Security and\nreorganized into the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n(\"BICE\"). For simplicity, we refer to the agency throughout this\nopinion as the INS.\n\n                                        -2-\n\f          On   November   25,   2003,   Aguilar-Osores,   through   new\n\ncounsel, filed a motion to reopen2 before the Immigration Judge on\n\nthe basis of ineffective assistance of counsel.      On December 22,\n\n2003, Aguilar-Osores filed a memorandum of law in support of his\n\nmotion to reopen.   Aguilar-Osores contended in the memorandum that\n\nthe filing deadline for a motion to reopen should not apply to his\n\ncase because of Loscocco's ineffective assistance.\n\n          Aguilar-Osores stated that, after he received the Notice\n\nto Appear, he met with Loscocco for a consultation.       According to\n\nAguilar-Osores, he specifically asked Loscocco whether threats made\n\nagainst his life as a result of his work in the anti-terrorist unit\n\nof the Peruvian Police Department made him eligible to apply for\n\nasylum or some other form of relief.    Loscocco told him that it was\n\ntoo late to apply for any type of relief except voluntary departure\n\nbecause Aguilar-Osores had been in the country for over one year,3\n\nand also suggested that Aguilar-Osores apply to the Diversity Visa\n\nLottery Program.    Loscocco then allegedly told Aguilar-Osores to\n\nattend a November 14, 2001 hearing at the Immigration Court,\n\n\n\n2\n   Aguilar-Osores also filed a motion for an emergency stay of\ndeportation. Since the instant appeal involves only the motion to\nreopen, we do not discuss any of the facts or proceedings related\nto Aguilar-Osores's motion for an emergency stay of deportation.\n3\n  Subject to certain exceptions, an alien must file an application\nfor asylum \"within one year after the date of the alien's arrival\nin the United States.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B). There is no such\ndeadline for applications for withholding of removal. See 8 C.F.R.\n§ 1208.4(a).\n\n                                  -3-\n\frequest a continuance to seek legal representation, and return to\n\nLoscocco's office. According to Aguilar-Osores, Loscocco indicated\n\nthat he would then ask for a second continuance as Aguilar-Osores's\n\nlegal representative.         Aguilar-Osores stated that he did what\n\nLoscocco told him to do.       He also stated that he met with Loscocco\n\nafter the November 14, 2001 hearing, and again asked about the\n\npossibility of applying for asylum.           Loscocco again told Aguilar-\n\nOsores that it was too late to apply for asylum.         Loscocco appeared\n\nwith   Aguilar-Osores    at   the   November    20,   2002   hearing,   where\n\nAguilar-Osores admitted the charges against him and requested\n\nvoluntary departure.     After the hearing, Loscocco took a $500.00\n\ncash payment from Aguilar-Osores and gave him a sticky note as a\n\nreceipt.   Loscocco also mailed Aguilar-Osores a letter reminding\n\nhim that he had to depart the United States by March 20, 2003.\n\n           In accordance with the requirements set forth in Matter\n\nof Lozada, 19 I & N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988),4 Aguilar-Osores\n\nattached   to   his   December   22,   2003    memorandum    in   support   of\n\n\n\n4\n   In order to screen frivolous ineffective assistance of counsel\nclaims, the BIA requires that a motion to reopen based on\nineffective assistance of counsel be accompanied by the following:\n(1) an affidavit from the alien detailing the agreement between the\nalien and the attorney; (2) evidence that the alien has informed\nhis attorney of the ineffective assistance allegations and has\ngiven the attorney an opportunity to respond; (3) evidence that the\nalien has filed a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary body\nregarding the attorney's alleged conduct or a satisfactory\nexplanation for not filing such a complaint. See Matter of Lozada,\n19 I & N Dec. at 639; Asaba v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 9, 11 (1st Cir.\n2004).\n\n                                    -4-\n\freopening    a   signed     affidavit    and    a     copy    of    an   ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel complaint addressed to the Massachusetts\n\nOffice of Bar Counsel.        On January 5, 2004, Aguilar-Osores filed a\n\nmotion to supplement his motion to reopen in order to apply for\n\nasylum based on changed circumstances in Peru.\n\n            On February 9, 2004, Aguilar-Osores filed a copy of\n\nLoscocco's response to the Office of the Bar Counsel addressing\n\nAguilar-Osores's allegations.           In this response, Loscocco stated\n\nthat, although he met with Aguilar-Osores on September 5, 2001,\n\nAguilar-Osores did not retain him as counsel until the day of his\n\nremoval    hearing    on    November    22,   2002,    when    he    paid   Loscocco\n\n$500.00.      Loscocco denied telling Aguilar-Osores to request a\n\ncontinuance      at   his   November    14,    2001    hearing      to   seek   legal\n\nrepresentation.       Loscocco also denied telling Aguilar-Osores that,\n\nas Aguilar-Osores's legal representative, he would seek a second\n\ncontinuance.      According to Loscocco, he discussed the possibility\n\nof applying for asylum with Aguilar-Osores, but Aguilar-Osores did\n\nnot claim to fear persecution, stating instead that he had come to\n\nthe United States for economic reasons.                 Aguilar-Osores did not\n\nmention any threats against him, and stated that he was willing to\n\nreturn to Peru but hoped to stay in the United States for as long\n\nas possible in order to make money.5                  Loscocco explained that\n\n\n\n5\n    According to Loscocco, Aguilar-Osores also claimed to have\nvisited the United States in 1994, but returned to Peru.\n\n                                        -5-\n\fAguilar-Osores        was    likely    ineligible      for   asylum     because     (1)\n\nAguilar-Osores had not applied for it within one year of his\n\narrival in the United States, (2) the two exceptions to the one-\n\nyear deadline likely did not apply, and (3) Aguilar-Osores had\n\nreturned to Peru in 1994 after an earlier visit to the United\n\nStates.       He also explained that any claim for withholding of\n\nremoval would not be likely to succeed since Aguilar-Osores would\n\nhave to satisfy a higher burden of proof than for asylum.\n\n              Loscocco stated that he and Aguilar-Osores also discussed\n\nseeking      permanent       resident    status       through    an     alien      labor\n\ncertification, but that Aguilar-Osores's illegal stay in the United\n\nStates barred that possibility.            Loscocco also prepared Diversity\n\nVisa Lottery applications for Aguilar-Osores and his wife in the\n\nfall    of    2002.         Finally,    Loscocco      stated    that,      after    the\n\nNovember 20, 2002 hearing, Aguilar-Osores did not respond to his\n\ncalls and letter regarding his departure date, and that Aguilar-\n\nOsores never raised the issue of asylum or withholding of removal\n\nafter   the    initial      consultation.        On    February      24,    2004,    the\n\nImmigration      Judge      denied     Aguilar-Osores's        motion      to   reopen.\n\nAguilar-Osores timely appealed to the BIA, which affirmed the\n\nImmigration     Judge's      decision     on   June    15,   2004.      This     appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\f                              II.    Discussion\n\n           Aguilar-Osores raises three claims: (1) that equitable\n\ntolling should be applied to his motion to reopen because of\n\nineffective assistance of counsel claim, (2) that the BIA abused\n\nits discretion in denying the motion to reopen so that he could\n\napply for asylum, and (3) that Aguilar-Osores was denied due\n\nprocess because he was deprived of the opportunity to seek asylum\n\nand withholding of removal before the Immigration Judge.              We deal\n\nwith each in turn.\n\n           \"The abuse of discretion standard governs judicial review\n\nof the denial of a     motion to reopen, regardless of the substantive\n\nclaim involved.\"      Jupiter v. Ashcroft, 396 F.3d 487, 490 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).    We   will    find   an    abuse   of   discretion   when   \"the   BIA\n\nmisinterprets the law, or acts either arbitrarily or capriciously.\"\n\nCanaveral Toban v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 40, 45 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\nA.   Ineffective Assistance of Counsel and Equitable Tolling\n\n           A motion to reopen before the Immigration Court \"must be\n\nfiled within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative\n\norder of removal, deportation, or exclusion, or on or before\n\nSeptember 30, 1996, whichever is later.\" 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1).\n\nThe Immigration Judge entered the order for voluntary departure on\n\nNovember 20, 2002.      Aguilar-Osores filed his motion to reopen on\n\nNovember 25, 2003, well past the ninety-day deadline set forth in\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1).6     Aguilar-Osores does not dispute this\n\nfact, but instead argues that equitable tolling should be applied\n\nto his case.   We need not reach this issue, however, because even\n\nif Aguilar-Osores's motion to reopen had been timely, he failed to\n\nestablish ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\n          An alien claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must\n\ngenerally demonstrate prejudice, see Canaveral Toban, 385 F.3d at\n\n46,7 which Aguilar-Osores has failed to do in the instant case.\n\nThe   Immigration    Judge,    after    evaluating   Aguilar-Osores's\n\nallegations and the response by Loscocco, stated that \"this Court\n\ndoes not find a valid ineffective assistance of counsel claim.\"\n\nThe   Immigration   Judge   concluded   that   Loscocco   \"offered   the\n\nrespondent [Aguilar-Osores] a comprehensive consultation disclosing\n\nall the potential consequences of filing any form of relief.\"        The\n\nImmigration Judge also found that Aguilar-Osores had come to the\n\nUnited States to earn money, that Loscocco provided him with\n\ncomprehensive and careful advice, and that it was Aguilar-Osores's\n\n\"uncoerced decision\" to pursue voluntary departure.           In other\n\nwords, the Immigration Judge found that Aguilar-Osores made a fully\n\n\n6\n  Aguilar-Osores's brief appears to argue from the premise that he\nhad 180 days to file motion to reopen. However, the 180-day time\nlimit only applies where an order of removal or deportation has\nbeen entered in absentia. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii)-(iii).\nAguilar-Osores was present at his hearing on November 20, 2002, and\nthe ninety-day time limit therefore applies.\n7\n  The requirement to demonstrate prejudices applies \"except in the\nextreme case.\" Canaveral Toban, 385 F.3d at 46.\n\n                                 -8-\n\finformed choice to pursue only voluntary departure, given the low\n\nchances for success on an asylum claim and that Aguilar-Osores had\n\ncome to the United States for economic reasons.\n\n            The BIA affirmed this finding, noting that Aguilar-Osores\n\n\"did not establish a prima facie case for reopening as his former\n\ncounsel did not provide ineffective assistance.\"     After carefully\n\nreviewing the record, we do not believe that the BIA abused its\n\ndiscretion in making this finding. We therefore find that Aguilar-\n\nOsores has not shown prejudice and affirm the BIA's decision\n\nregarding ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\nB.   Application for Asylum\n\n            The ninety-day limit to file a motion to reopen does not\n\napply \"if the basis of the motion is to apply for asylum . . . and\n\nis based on changed country conditions arising in the country of\n\nnationality . . . if such evidence is material and was not\n\navailable and could not have been discovered or presented at the\n\nprevious proceeding.\" 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i). Aguilar-Osores\n\nargues that the BIA abused its discretion in finding that he failed\n\nto meet the standards set forth in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i).   We\n\ndisagree.\n\n            Aguilar-Osores argues that he presented evidence of the\n\nresurgence of the Shining Path guerilla organization in Peru during\n\n2002 and 2003.   Since Aguilar-Osores worked for the anti-terrorist\n\nunit as a policeman in Peru and was involved in thwarting several\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fShining    Path   operations,   he    argues   that   the   Shining   Path's\n\nresurgence would put him in danger should he return to Peru.              As\n\nthe BIA noted, the alleged resurgence of the Shining Path began at\n\nleast seven months prior to Aguilar-Osores's November 22, 2002\n\nhearing.   Accordingly, this evidence was either available or could\n\nhave been discovered or presented at the November 22, 2002 hearing.\n\nAguilar-Osores attempts to circumvent this problem by arguing that\n\nthis would have been impossible due to the alleged ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel.     However, as we have already noted above,\n\nLoscocco did not provide ineffective assistance.              We therefore\n\nagree with the BIA that evidence of the Shining Path's resurgence\n\nwas available and could have been presented at Aguilar-Osores's\n\nNovember 22, 2002 hearing, and find no abuse of discretion in the\n\nBIA's decision regarding Aguilar-Osores's failure to meet the\n\nrequirements of 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i).\n\nC.   Due Process\n\n            Finally, Aguilar-Osores argues denial of due process\n\nbecause, as a result of ineffective assistance of counsel, he was\n\ndeprived of the opportunity to seek asylum and withholding of\n\nremoval before the Immigration Judge.8           However, since Aguilar-\n\n\n\n\n8\n  Aguilar-Osores failed to raise this claim before the Immigration\nJudge and BIA. We could therefore find that he has waived this\nclaim.   See Mendes v. INS, 197 F.3d 6, 12 (1st Cir. 1999).\nHowever, we bypass the waiver issue because the claim is obviously\nmeritless.\n\n                                     -10-\n\fOsores has failed to prove ineffective assistance of counsel, see\n\nsupra Part II(A), we find no due process violation.\n\n                            III.    Conclusion\n\n            For   the   reasons    stated   above,   the   BIA's   order   is\n\naffirmed.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\f",

On June 4, 2001, the Immigration and\n\nNaturalization Service (\"INS\")1 issued a Notice to Appear, charging\n\nAguilar-Osores    with      removability      under    §   237(a)(1)(B)      of   the\n\nImmigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B),\n\nfor overstaying his visa.\n\n            In written pleadings on November 20, 2002, Aguilar-\n\nOsores, through his counsel John Loscocco (\"Loscocco\"), admitted\n\nthe factual allegations against him, conceded removability, and\n\nrequested    relief    in    the     form   of   voluntary      departure.

Aguilar-Osores failed to depart by\n\nthat date, and on August 27, 2003, the Department of Homeland\n\nSecurity arrested him.\n\n\n1\n    In March 2003, the relevant functions of the INS were\ntransferred into the new Department of Homeland Security and\nreorganized into the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n(\"BICE\"). For simplicity, we refer to the agency throughout this\nopinion as the INS.\n\n                                        -2-\n\f          On   November   25,   2003,   Aguilar-Osores,   through   new\n\ncounsel, filed a motion to reopen2 before the Immigration Judge on\n\nthe basis of ineffective assistance of counsel.      On December 22,\n\n2003, Aguilar-Osores filed a memorandum of law in support of his\n\nmotion to reopen.   Aguilar-Osores contended in the memorandum that\n\nthe filing deadline for a motion to reopen should not apply to his\n\ncase because of Loscocco's ineffective assistance.\n\n          Aguilar-Osores stated that, after he received the Notice\n\nto Appear, he met with Loscocco for a consultation.       According to\n\nAguilar-Osores, he specifically asked Loscocco whether threats made\n\nagainst his life as a result of his work in the anti-terrorist unit\n\nof the Peruvian Police Department made him eligible to apply for\n\nasylum or some other form of relief.    Loscocco told him that it was\n\ntoo late to apply for any type of relief except voluntary departure\n\nbecause Aguilar-Osores had been in the country for over one year,3\n\nand also suggested that Aguilar-Osores apply to the Diversity Visa\n\nLottery Program.    Loscocco then allegedly told Aguilar-Osores to\n\nattend a November 14, 2001 hearing at the Immigration Court,\n\n\n\n2\n   Aguilar-Osores also filed a motion for an emergency stay of\ndeportation. Since the instant appeal involves only the motion to\nreopen, we do not discuss any of the facts or proceedings related\nto Aguilar-Osores's motion for an emergency stay of deportation.\n3\n  Subject to certain exceptions, an alien must file an application\nfor asylum \"within one year after the date of the alien's arrival\nin the United States.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B). There is no such\ndeadline for applications for withholding of removal. See 8 C.F.R.\n§ 1208.4(a).\n\n                                  -3-\n\frequest a continuance to seek legal representation, and return to\n\nLoscocco's office. According to Aguilar-Osores, Loscocco indicated\n\nthat he would then ask for a second continuance as Aguilar-Osores's\n\nlegal representative.         Aguilar-Osores stated that he did what\n\nLoscocco told him to do.       He also stated that he met with Loscocco\n\nafter the November 14, 2001 hearing, and again asked about the\n\npossibility of applying for asylum.           Loscocco again told Aguilar-\n\nOsores that it was too late to apply for asylum.         Loscocco appeared\n\nwith   Aguilar-Osores    at   the   November    20,   2002   hearing,   where\n\nAguilar-Osores admitted the charges against him and requested\n\nvoluntary departure.     After the hearing, Loscocco took a $500.00\n\ncash payment from Aguilar-Osores and gave him a sticky note as a\n\nreceipt.   Loscocco also mailed Aguilar-Osores a letter reminding\n\nhim that he had to depart the United States by March 20, 2003.\n\n           In accordance with the requirements set forth in Matter\n\nof Lozada, 19 I & N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988),4 Aguilar-Osores\n\nattached   to   his   December   22,   2003    memorandum    in   support   of\n\n\n\n4\n   In order to screen frivolous ineffective assistance of counsel\nclaims, the BIA requires that a motion to reopen based on\nineffective assistance of counsel be accompanied by the following:\n(1) an affidavit from the alien detailing the agreement between the\nalien and the attorney; (2) evidence that the alien has informed\nhis attorney of the ineffective assistance allegations and has\ngiven the attorney an opportunity to respond; (3) evidence that the\nalien has filed a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary body\nregarding the attorney's alleged conduct or a satisfactory\nexplanation for not filing such a complaint.

On January 5, 2004, Aguilar-Osores filed a\n\nmotion to supplement his motion to reopen in order to apply for\n\nasylum based on changed circumstances in Peru.\n\n            On February 9, 2004, Aguilar-Osores filed a copy of\n\nLoscocco's response to the Office of the Bar Counsel addressing\n\nAguilar-Osores's allegations.           In this response, Loscocco stated\n\nthat, although he met with Aguilar-Osores on September 5, 2001,\n\nAguilar-Osores did not retain him as counsel until the day of his\n\nremoval    hearing    on    November    22,   2002,    when    he    paid   Loscocco\n\n$500.00.      Loscocco denied telling Aguilar-Osores to request a\n\ncontinuance      at   his   November    14,    2001    hearing      to   seek   legal\n\nrepresentation.       Loscocco also denied telling Aguilar-Osores that,\n\nas Aguilar-Osores's legal representative, he would seek a second\n\ncontinuance.      According to Loscocco, he discussed the possibility\n\nof applying for asylum with Aguilar-Osores, but Aguilar-Osores did\n\nnot claim to fear persecution, stating instead that he had come to\n\nthe United States for economic reasons.                 Aguilar-Osores did not\n\nmention any threats against him, and stated that he was willing to\n\nreturn to Peru but hoped to stay in the United States for as long\n\nas possible in order to make money.5                  Loscocco explained that\n\n\n\n5\n    According to Loscocco, Aguilar-Osores also claimed to have\nvisited the United States in 1994, but returned to Peru.\n\n                                        -5-\n\fAguilar-Osores        was    likely    ineligible      for   asylum     because     (1)\n\nAguilar-Osores had not applied for it within one year of his\n\narrival in the United States, (2) the two exceptions to the one-\n\nyear deadline likely did not apply, and (3) Aguilar-Osores had\n\nreturned to Peru in 1994 after an earlier visit to the United\n\nStates.       He also explained that any claim for withholding of\n\nremoval would not be likely to succeed since Aguilar-Osores would\n\nhave to satisfy a higher burden of proof than for asylum.\n\n              Loscocco stated that he and Aguilar-Osores also discussed\n\nseeking      permanent       resident    status       through    an     alien      labor\n\ncertification, but that Aguilar-Osores's illegal stay in the United\n\nStates barred that possibility.            Loscocco also prepared Diversity\n\nVisa Lottery applications for Aguilar-Osores and his wife in the\n\nfall    of    2002.         Finally,    Loscocco      stated    that,      after    the\n\nNovember 20, 2002 hearing, Aguilar-Osores did not respond to his\n\ncalls and letter regarding his departure date, and that Aguilar-\n\nOsores never raised the issue of asylum or withholding of removal\n\nafter   the    initial      consultation.        On    February      24,    2004,    the\n\nImmigration      Judge      denied     Aguilar-Osores's        motion      to   reopen.\n\nAguilar-Osores timely appealed to the BIA, which affirmed the\n\nImmigration     Judge's      decision     on   June    15,   2004.      This     appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\f                              II.    Discussion\n\n           Aguilar-Osores raises three claims: (1) that equitable\n\ntolling should be applied to his motion to reopen because of\n\nineffective assistance of counsel claim, (2) that the BIA abused\n\nits discretion in denying the motion to reopen so that he could\n\napply for asylum, and (3) that Aguilar-Osores was denied due\n\nprocess because he was deprived of the opportunity to seek asylum\n\nand withholding of removal before the Immigration Judge.              We deal\n\nwith each in turn.\n\n           \"The abuse of discretion standard governs judicial review\n\nof the denial of a     motion to reopen, regardless of the substantive\n\nclaim involved.\"      Jupiter v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201441\"><a href=\"/opinion/201441/jupiter-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">396</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">487</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 490 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).    We   will    find   an    abuse   of   discretion   when   \"the   BIA\n\nmisinterprets the law, or acts either arbitrarily or capriciously.\"\n\nCanaveral Toban v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201250\"><a href=\"/opinion/201250/canaveral-toban-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">385</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 45 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\nA.   Ineffective Assistance of Counsel and Equitable Tolling\n\n           A motion to reopen before the Immigration Court \"must be\n\nfiled within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative\n\norder of removal, deportation, or exclusion, or on or before\n\nSeptember 30, 1996, whichever is later.\" 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1).\n\nThe Immigration Judge entered the order for voluntary departure on\n\nNovember 20, 2002.      Aguilar-Osores filed his motion to reopen on\n\nNovember 25, 2003, well past the ninety-day deadline set forth in\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1).6     Aguilar-Osores does not dispute this\n\nfact, but instead argues that equitable tolling should be applied\n\nto his case.   We need not reach this issue, however, because even\n\nif Aguilar-Osores's motion to reopen had been timely, he failed to\n\nestablish ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\n          An alien claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must\n\ngenerally demonstrate prejudice, see Canaveral Toban, 385 F.3d at\n\n46,7 which Aguilar-Osores has failed to do in the instant case.\n\nThe   Immigration    Judge,    after    evaluating   Aguilar-Osores's\n\nallegations and the response by Loscocco, stated that \"this Court\n\ndoes not find a valid ineffective assistance of counsel claim.\"\n\nThe   Immigration   Judge   concluded   that   Loscocco   \"offered   the\n\nrespondent [Aguilar-Osores] a comprehensive consultation disclosing\n\nall the potential consequences of filing any form of relief.\"        The\n\nImmigration Judge also found that Aguilar-Osores had come to the\n\nUnited States to earn money, that Loscocco provided him with\n\ncomprehensive and careful advice, and that it was Aguilar-Osores's\n\n\"uncoerced decision\" to pursue voluntary departure.           In other\n\nwords, the Immigration Judge found that Aguilar-Osores made a fully\n\n\n6\n  Aguilar-Osores's brief appears to argue from the premise that he\nhad 180 days to file motion to reopen. However, the 180-day time\nlimit only applies where an order of removal or deportation has\nbeen entered in absentia. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii)-(iii).\nAguilar-Osores was present at his hearing on November 20, 2002, and\nthe ninety-day time limit therefore applies.\n7\n  The requirement to demonstrate prejudices applies \"except in the\nextreme case.\" Canaveral Toban, 385 F.3d at 46.\n\n                                 -8-\n\finformed choice to pursue only voluntary departure, given the low\n\nchances for success on an asylum claim and that Aguilar-Osores had\n\ncome to the United States for economic reasons.\n\n            The BIA affirmed this finding, noting that Aguilar-Osores\n\n\"did not establish a prima facie case for reopening as his former\n\ncounsel did not provide ineffective assistance.\"     After carefully\n\nreviewing the record, we do not believe that the BIA abused its\n\ndiscretion in making this finding. We therefore find that Aguilar-\n\nOsores has not shown prejudice and affirm the BIA's decision\n\nregarding ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\nB.   Application for Asylum\n\n            The ninety-day limit to file a motion to reopen does not\n\napply \"if the basis of the motion is to apply for asylum . . . and\n\nis based on changed country conditions arising in the country of\n\nnationality . . . if such evidence is material and was not\n\navailable and could not have been discovered or presented at the\n\nprevious proceeding.\" 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i). Aguilar-Osores\n\nargues that the BIA abused its discretion in finding that he failed\n\nto meet the standards set forth in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i).   We\n\ndisagree.\n\n            Aguilar-Osores argues that he presented evidence of the\n\nresurgence of the Shining Path guerilla organization in Peru during\n\n2002 and 2003.   Since Aguilar-Osores worked for the anti-terrorist\n\nunit as a policeman in Peru and was involved in thwarting several\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fShining    Path   operations,   he    argues   that   the   Shining   Path's\n\nresurgence would put him in danger should he return to Peru.              As\n\nthe BIA noted, the alleged resurgence of the Shining Path began at\n\nleast seven months prior to Aguilar-Osores's November 22, 2002\n\nhearing.   Accordingly, this evidence was either available or could\n\nhave been discovered or presented at the November 22, 2002 hearing.\n\nAguilar-Osores attempts to circumvent this problem by arguing that\n\nthis would have been impossible due to the alleged ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel.     However, as we have already noted above,\n\nLoscocco did not provide ineffective assistance.              We therefore\n\nagree with the BIA that evidence of the Shining Path's resurgence\n\nwas available and could have been presented at Aguilar-Osores's\n\nNovember 22, 2002 hearing, and find no abuse of discretion in the\n\nBIA's decision regarding Aguilar-Osores's failure to meet the\n\nrequirements of 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i).\n\nC.   Due Process\n\n            Finally, Aguilar-Osores argues denial of due process\n\nbecause, as a result of ineffective assistance of counsel, he was\n\ndeprived of the opportunity to seek asylum and withholding of\n\nremoval before the Immigration Judge.8           However, since Aguilar-\n\n\n\n\n8\n  Aguilar-Osores failed to raise this claim before the Immigration\nJudge and BIA. We could therefore find that he has waived this\nclaim.   See Mendes v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198722\"><a href=\"/opinion/198722/mendes-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 12 (1st Cir. 1999).\nHowever, we bypass the waiver issue because the claim is obviously\nmeritless.\n\n                                     -10-\n\fOsores has failed to prove ineffective assistance of counsel, see\n\nsupra Part II(A), we find no due process violation.\n\n                            III.    Conclusion\n\n            For   the   reasons    stated   above,   the   BIA's   order   is\n\naffirmed.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\f</pre>",
