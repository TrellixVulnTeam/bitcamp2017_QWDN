  <summary>7/31/2014--Introduced.
Accountable Recovery Act - Amends the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to direct the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Commerce as appropriate to make recovery plans for the conservation and survival of a species publicly available at the time of a determination that the species is endangered or threatened. Requires the plans to incorporate objective numerical recovery goals for removal of species from the endangered and threatened species list.

Gives the appropriate Secretary 30 days to deny a petition stating that the numerical recovery goal has been achieved for a species. Removes a species from the endangered and threatened species list if the Secretary has not acted on a petition.</summary>
