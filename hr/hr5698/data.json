Sets forth reporting requirements, including requiring the final report to identify lessons learned regarding Service leadership issues and to include recommendations for improving efficiency and effectiveness, improving unity of effort, eliminating barriers to effective communications, identifying and mitigating culture issues that detract from its mission, and mitigating risks based on past security breaches."
