    "text": "Legal Workforce Act - (Sec. 2) Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to require an employer to attest, during the specified verification period for recruiting or hiring, and under penalty of perjury, that the employer has verified that an individual is not an unauthorized alien by:\n\n obtaining and recording the individual's Social Security account number or a Department of Homeland Services (DHS)-established identification or authorization number, and examining specified documents that establish such individual's identity and employment authorization. Authorizes DHS to prohibit or restrict the use of documents it finds unreliable.\n\nRequires an individual to attest, under penalty of perjury, that he or she is a U.S. citizen or national, a lawful permanent resident, or an alien authorized to work in the United States.\n\nRequires an employer to:\n\n retain a copy of the verification form for a specified period of time and make it available for inspection by DHS, the Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices, or the Department of Labor; record notices of confirmation or nonconfirmation of a person's identity or work eligibility; and notify an individual for whom a tentative nonconfirmation of identity or work eligibility has been received. Makes a nonconfirmation final if the person does not contest the nonconfirmation within a specified time period.\n\nAuthorizes an employer who has received a final nonconfirmation for an individual to terminate or decline to recruit that individual. Requires an employer who does not terminate such employment or recruitment to notify DHS. Makes failure to notify or to continue employment a violation of the prohibition on unlawful employment of aliens.\n\nEstablishes a phased-in employment eligibility verification system (EEVS) participation deadline (6-24 months) for employers based upon the number of employees. Requires agricultural employer participation within 24 months.\n\nAuthorizes an employer to condition a job offer based upon E-Verify confirmation.\n\n Requires employers to verify the work eligibility of aliens (phased-in over 6-24 months) with temporary work authorization within three business days after the date on which their work authorization expires.\n\nRequires reverification within six months of the following workers who have not been verified under E-Verify: (1) federal, state, or local government employees; (2) certain employees who require a federal security clearance; and (3) certain employees assigned to work in the United States under a federal contract.\n\nAuthorizes an employer voluntarily to reverify employees. (Requires any such reverification to be applied to all individuals so employed).\n\nRequires the Social Security Administration (SSA) to notify annually all employees who submit a Social Security number to which more than one employer reports income if there is a pattern of unusual multiple use.\n\nProhibits the information provided under the employment eligibility confirmation process from being used other than for enforcement of this Act and other federal criminal provisions.\n\nPrescribes factors for good faith compliance.\n\n(Sec. 3) Directs the Secretary of DHS (Secretary) to establish EEVS patterned after the E-Verify system. (Eliminates the current paper-based I-9 system.)\n\nRequires EEVS to:\n\n be telephone- and electronic media-accessible; provide employers with temporary verification or nonverification within 3 working days of an inquiry, and in the case of nonverification, a final verification or nonverification within 10 working days; provide maximum identity theft protection; and limit the subjects of verification to individuals hired, referred, or recruited, employees and prospective employees, and individuals seeking to confirm voluntarily their own employment eligibility.
