Makes the funding available, however, only if the President subsequently designates the amount as an emergency requirement.\n\nPermits the activities funded under this Act to include acquisition of products such as drugs, vaccines and other biological products, and medical devices for deposit into the Strategic National Stockpile.\n\nAmends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act) to add the Public Health Emergency Fund to the list of programs and activities exempt from a sequestration. (A sequestration is a process of automatic, usually across-the-board spending reductions under which budgetary resources are permanently cancelled to enforce specific budget policy goals.)"
