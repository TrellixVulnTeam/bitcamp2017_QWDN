  <summary>9/18/2014--Introduced.
Manufacturing Skills Act of 2014 - Directs the Secretaries of Commerce, Labor, Education, and Defense (DOD) and the Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF) to jointly establish a Manufacturing Skills Partnership to administer and carry out a program to award compeititve, three-year grants to enable up to five states and five metropolitan areas to carry out proposals to promote reforms in workforce education and skill training for manufacturing.

Requires the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST): (1) acting through the Advanced Manufacturing National Program Office, to conduct an audit of all federal education and skills training programs related to manufacturing to ensure that states and metropolitan areas are able to align federal resources with the labor demands of their primary manufacturing industries; and (2) to work with states and metropolitan areas to determine how federal funds can be more tailored to meet their different needs.</summary>
