  <summary>11/18/2014--Introduced.
Requires a revision to the Federal Acquisition Regulation to require a certification from each person that is a prospective government contractor that such person, and any person owned or controlled by such person, is not a boycotting person (a person who refuses to do business with a country with which the United States has a fair trade agreement). Debars from eligibility for federal contracts for at least two years any person who submits a false certification.</summary>
