Requires DOE to give preference to existing facilities and National Marine Renewable Energy Research, Development, and Demonstration Centers.\n\nRenames the Centers as the \"National Marine and Hydrokinetic Renewable Energy Research, Development, and Demonstration Centers\" and expands their research and clearinghouse duties to include hydrokinetic energy. Authorizes the Centers to serve as technology test facilities.\n\nRequires DOE to establish a marine-based energy device verification program to provide a bridge from marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy capture device design and development efforts to commercial deployment.\n\nRequires DOE to establish a grant program to advance the development of marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy and associated devises and technologies.\n\nAuthorizes\u00a0appropriations for the marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy technologies program through FY2016."
