George Z. Singal, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                   Selya, Lynch and Howard,\n                        Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Thomas J. Connolly on brief for appellant.\n     F. Mark Terison, Senior Litigation Counsel, and Paula D.\nSilsby, United States Attorney, on brief of appellee.\n\n                   ON PETITION FOR REHEARING\n\n                           May 10, 2005\n\f      Per Curiam.      This case presents the issue of whether the\n\nissuance of the United States Supreme Court's decision in Booker v.\n\nUnited States, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005), itself constitutes a reason\n\nto recall mandate to permit a defendant to present arguments to\n\nthis court that his sentence should be vacated and the case\n\nremanded    for   resentencing.        We    answer    that    question   in    the\n\nnegative.    We hold that the normal and extremely rigorous standard\n\nfor recalling mandate established in Calderon v. Thompson, 523 U.S.\n\n538, 550 (1998), applies to cases seeking to recall mandate under\n\nBooker.     As defendant cannot meet that standard, we deny his\n\nmotion.\n\n      In   November    2004    this    court   affirmed       defendant   Gregory\n\nFraser's sentence of 54 months of imprisonment after he pled guilty\n\nto possessing stolen firearms in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(j).\n\nIn   our   decision,   we     rejected      Fraser's   argument,       made   in   a\n\nsupplemental brief, that under Blakely v. Washington, 124 S. Ct.\n\n2531 (2004), he was entitled to have his sentence recalculated\n\nbecause he had not admitted to (nor had a jury found beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt) two sentencing factors: a prior state-court\n\ncontinuance without a finding and his possession of 29 guns.                    See\n\nUnited States v. Fraser, 388 F.3d 371, 376-77 (1st Cir. 2004) (per\n\ncuriam).\n\n      Fraser   allowed   the    time     for   petitioning      this    court   for\n\nrehearing to expire and then belatedly requested additional time to\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\ffile a petition for panel rehearing, which this court allowed.\n\nNonetheless, he then was late in filing his petition for panel\n\nrehearing or for rehearing en banc, filing it two days beyond the\n\nextended deadline.      Fraser also did not move to stay mandate\n\npending the filing of a petition for a writ of certiorari.   Mandate\n\nthen issued.      Only a timely petition for rehearing stays the\n\nissuance of mandate.   Fed. R. App. P. 41(d)(1).   While the untimely\n\npetition for rehearing was pending, the time for filing a petition\n\nfor a writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court also\n\nexpired.   See S. Ct. R. 13.\n\n     Fraser's untimely petition for rehearing from the November\n\n2004 decision is before us.    It cannot be granted because mandate\n\nhas issued.     See Boston & Maine Corp. v. Town of Hampton, 7 F.3d\n\n281, 282 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n     We will treat the untimely petition as a motion to recall\n\nmandate, over which we do have jurisdiction. Id. Nonetheless, the\n\nSupreme Court has instructed that we may exercise that power only\n\nupon a showing of \"extraordinary circumstances.\"       Calderon, 523\n\nU.S. at 550.1    \"Resort to recall power is an 'extraordinary step,'\n\nand 'should not be used simply as a device for granting late\n\nrehearing.'\"    Boston & Maine Corp., 7 F.3d at 283 (quoting Johnson\n\nv. Bechtel Assocs. Prof'l Corp., 801 F.2d 412, 416 (D.C. Cir.\n\n\n     1\n        As in Calderon, this case does not involve recall of\nmandate to correct mere clerical errors in the judgment itself,\nor any claim of fraud upon the court. Calderon, 523 U.S. at 557.\n\n                                 -3-\n\f1986)).     \"Recall of a mandate -- other than to correct a clerical\n\nerror -- threatens important interests in finality and is a step to\n\nbe taken only in the most unusual circumstances.\" Conley v. United\n\nStates, 323 F.3d 7, 14 (1st Cir. 2003) (declining to recall\n\nmandate).     No such extraordinary circumstances are present here.2\n\n      To recall mandate in these circumstances would not only\n\nundercut finality, but it would threaten the restrictions on relief\n\nunder other doctrines. This court has held that petitions under 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2255 are unavailable to advance Booker claims in the\n\nabsence of a Supreme Court decision rendering Booker retroactive.\n\nCirilo-Muñoz v. United States, No. 02-1846, slip op. at 14 (1st\n\nCir. Apr.        , 2005).    If mandate could be recalled merely based on\n\nBooker,     that    result    would   provide         an   avenue   to   escape    the\n\nrestrictions Congress has imposed on habeas review.\n\n      Finally, we have said there is nothing fundamentally unfair in\n\nthe   use   of     judge-made   findings         of   fact.     United    States    v.\n\nAntonakopolous, 399 F.3d 68, 75 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n      This case therefore falls far short of the \"extraordinary\n\ncircumstances\"        necessary       to     warrant       recall    of    mandate.\n\nAccordingly, treating Fraser's untimely petition for rehearing as\n\na motion to recall mandate, that motion is denied.\n\n      So ordered.\n\n\n      2\n        This case does not present the rare circumstance where\nmandate had issued but the period of time for petitioning for\ncertiorari has not lapsed.\n\n                                           -4-\n\f",
