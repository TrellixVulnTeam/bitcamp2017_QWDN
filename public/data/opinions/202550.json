Patrik Thomas seeks review of a Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals (BIA) order dismissing his appeal from an\n\nadverse decision by an immigration judge (IJ).          The IJ determined\n\nthat Thomas was ineligible to apply for asylum, and she denied his\n\napplication for withholding of removal and protection under the\n\nConvention Against Torture (CAT).           For the following reasons, we\n\ndeny the petition for review.\n\n           1.     The BIA agreed with the IJ's determination that\n\nThomas was ineligible for asylum because his application was late\n\nand no statutory exception applied, and we lack jurisdiction to\n\nreview that determination. Hayek v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 501, 506-07\n\n(1st Cir. 2006) (per curiam).\n\n           2.     The BIA agreed with the IJ's determination that\n\nThomas   was    not   entitled   to   either   withholding   of   removal   or\n\nprotection under the CAT.1       Substantial evidence of record supports\n\nthat determination. The IJ's decision recites the facts, and so we\n\ndo not repeat them here.         We note only that Thomas failed to show\n\nthat any governmental action or inaction contributed to the adverse\n\nevents he experienced in Jakarta on account of his religion, and\n\nthat his family still lives there, practicing their faith without\n\n\n     1\n      We bypass the question whether we have jurisdiction to\nconsider the CAT issue, which the BIA addressed despite the lack of\nbriefing by Thomas. Abimbola v. Ashcroft, 378 F.3d 173, 180 (2d\nCir. 2004) (explaining that where the jurisdictional question is\ndifficult, the court of appeals may assume that it has statutory\njurisdiction and decide the petition on the merits in favor of the\nparty in whose favor want of jurisdiction would operate).\n\n                                      -2-\n\fharm.   Our case law confirms that the denial of relief was proper.\n\nE.g., Nikijuluw v. Gonzalez, 427 F.3d 115, 121 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(denying petition for review by an Indonesian Christian because he\n\nhad suffered only \"isolated acts of private discrimination\" and his\n\nfamily continued to live safely in Indonesia).\n\n           3.   Thomas offers new facts and materials to support his\n\npetition, but our review is limited to information in the appellate\n\nrecord.   See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(A).\n\n           The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f",
