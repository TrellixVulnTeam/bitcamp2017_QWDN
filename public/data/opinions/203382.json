Daniel R. Domínguez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                        Lynch, Chief Judge,\n                  O'Connor,* Associate Justice,\n                  and Torruella, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Johnny Rivera González for appellant.\n     Thomas F. Klumper, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nRosa Emilia Rodríguez-Vélez, United States Attorney, and Nelson\nPérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                          July 10, 2008\n\n\n\n     *\n          The Hon. Sandra Day O'Connor, Associate Justice (Ret.) of\nthe Supreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.\n\f          LYNCH, Chief Judge.       We apply, for the first time, the\n\nSupreme Court's recent plain error decisions to a defendant's\n\nunpreserved claim of Rule 11(b)(1)(N) error as to a waiver of\n\nappeal clause at the change-of-plea hearing.         See United States v.\n\nDominguez Benitez, 542 U.S. 74 (2004); United States v. Vonn, 535\n\nU.S. 55 (2002); cf. United States v. Teeter, 257 F.3d 14 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).\n\n            In   doing   so,   we   join   the   other   circuits   to   have\n\nconsidered the question and hold that the plain error standard\n\napplies to unpreserved claims of violations of Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n11(b)(1)(N), albeit our understanding of the plain error rule seems\n\nto differ from some.     See, e.g., United States v. Murdock, 398 F.3d\n\n491, 496 (6th Cir. 2005); United States v. Arellano-Gallegos, 387\n\nF.3d 794, 797 (9th Cir. 2004).      The defendant must show, as part of\n\nhis demonstration that his substantial rights were affected, a\n\nreasonable probability that he would not have entered the plea had\n\nthe error not been made.\n\n          We conclude that defendant has not met his burden, and\n\nthe waiver of appeal clause at issue here is to be enforced.             As a\n\nresult, we do not reach defendant's underlying arguments that the\n\nplea is invalid for other reasons.\n\n                                     I.\n\n          On July 20, 2005, in a one-count indictment covering him\n\nand eleven co-defendants, Juan Borrero-Acevedo was charged with\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fconspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or\n\nmore of cocaine and one kilogram or more of a mixture or substance\n\ncontaining a detectable amount of heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A), 846. The indictment identified Borrero\n\nas one of the suppliers for the conspiracy's drug points.             After\n\ninitially pleading not guilty, Borrero filed a motion to change his\n\nplea, which was referred to a magistrate judge.\n\n           The change-of-plea hearing was conducted on June 9, 2006,\n\nby a magistrate judge.       Borrero entered a guilty plea pursuant to\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1)(A) and (B) and an agreement with the\n\ngovernment.     The   plea    agreement   stated,   and   the    government\n\ntestified at the hearing, that at trial the government would have\n\npresented evidence establishing that, from 1999 to the date of the\n\nindictment, the defendant participated in the distribution of\n\ncocaine and heroin in the La Via sector at Aguadilla, Puerto Rico.\n\nDuring this time, defendant was considered a supply source for\n\nheroin in La Via and was involved in at least one drug transaction\n\nthere.   He conspired to sell between 700 grams and one kilogram of\n\nheroin in furtherance of the conspiracy.\n\n           Borrero benefitted from the plea agreement he had reached\n\nwith the government.     Based on the charges in the indictment,\n\nBorrero was subject to a minimum ten-year sentence.             Pursuant to\n\nthe plea agreement, the government recommended an eighty-seven\n\nmonth prison term, which was the sentence the court imposed.            The\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fplea agreement contained a simple and easily understood waiver of\n\nappeal.    This waiver stated: \"The defendant hereby agrees that if\n\nthis Honorable Court accepts this agreement and sentences him\n\naccording   to   its   terms   and    conditions,   defendant   waives    and\n\nsurrenders his right to appeal the judgment and sentence in this\n\ncase.\"\n\n            In 1999, Congress added to Rule 11 what would become\n\nsection (b)(1)(N), which requires the court both to inform the\n\ndefendant of and to determine that the defendant understands \"the\n\nterms of any plea-agreement provision waiving the right to appeal\n\nor   to collaterally attack the sentence.\"1            Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n11(b)(1)(N).     The purpose of the amendment was to ensure that\n\nwaivers of appellate rights are knowing and voluntary.          See id. 11\n\nadvisory    committee's    note      (\"1999   Amendments\").     When     Rule\n\n11(b)(1)(N) was added, it became subject to the terms of Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 11(h) that \"[a] variance from the requirements of this\n\nrule is harmless error if it does not affect substantial rights.\"\n\n\n\n      1\n            The provision states:\n\n            Before the court accepts a plea of guilty or nolo\n            contendere, the defendant may be placed under oath,\n            and the court must address the defendant personally\n            in open court. During this address, the court must\n            inform the defendant of, and determine that the\n            defendant understands, . . . the terms of any plea-\n            agreement provision waiving the right to appeal or\n            to collaterally attack the sentence.\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 11(b)(1)(N).\n\n                                      -4-\n\fThis language is similar to the harmless error rule in Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 52(a).\n\n             It is undisputed here that the magistrate judge failed to\n\ncomply   with    the   requirements    of    Rule   11(b)(1)(N)    during   the\n\ncolloquy with the defendant at the change-of-plea hearing.                  The\n\nprosecutor      also   failed   to   point   out    the   waiver   during   the\n\ncolloquy.2\n\n             Borrero could have attempted, based on this omission, to\n\nwithdraw his guilty plea in the trial court before sentencing. See\n\nid. 11(d)(2)(B).       Had he done so, he would have had to show only a\n\n\"fair and just reason for withdrawal.\" Id.; see also, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Newbert, 504 F.3d 180, 183-84 (1st Cir. 2007) (affirming\n\ndecision of trial court not to enforce waiver of rights where\n\ndefendant had been permitted to withdraw his plea under Rule\n\n11(d)(2)(B)).      Having raised the omission for the first time on\n\nappeal, Borrero faces a much tougher standard.\n\n             Borrero argues that the magistrate judge's failure to ask\n\nhim specifically about the waiver of appeal means that he is not\n\nbound by this waiver.      Not so.3   Borrero's primary argument is that\n\n\n     2\n          As a matter of efficiency and securing finality,\nprosecutors would be well-advised to call such omissions to the\nattention of the court at change-of-plea hearings.\n     3\n          In its initial brief, the United States took the position\nthat because there had been no mention of the appellate waiver at\nthe plea colloquy, the waiver could not be enforced. This court is\nnot bound by a party's concessions. See United States v. Mescual-\nCruz, 387 F.3d 1, 8 n.2 (1st Cir. 2004). The court directed the\n\n                                      -5-\n\fit would be unjust to hold him to the waiver of appeal because this\n\nwould block him from making his argument on the merits, which is\n\nthat insufficient attention was paid to whether his plea was\n\nvoluntary given that it was part of a package deal and he might\n\nhave been coerced into pleading guilty by a co-defendant.\n\n                                     II.\n\n          Vonn    resolved    a   circuit    split4   on   the   standard    for\n\nevaluating Rule 11 errors.        It held that a defendant who has not\n\npreserved his claim of Rule 11 error and wishes to be relieved of\n\nhis guilty plea on appeal must satisfy the plain error standard of\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 52(b).       Vonn, 535 U.S. at 58-59.\n\n          In     order   to   show   plain     error,      a   defendant    must\n\ndemonstrate that there is \"(1) 'error,' (2) that is 'plain,' and\n\n(3) that 'affect[s] substantial rights.'          If all three conditions\n\nare met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to\n\nnotice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error 'seriously\n\naffect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial\n\nproceedings.'\"    Johnson v. United States, 520 U.S. 461, 467 (1997)\n\n\nparties to file supplemental briefs on the waiver issue, calling\ntheir attention to the case law on point. Thereafter, the United\nStates filed a supplemental brief reversing its position and\narguing that defendant was bound by his appellate waiver because he\nhad not met the third prong of the plain error test.\n     4\n          Before Vonn, this court had held that unpreserved claims\nof Rule 11 error were subject to plain error review under Rule\n52(b), and not harmless error review. See United States v. Gandia-\nMaysonet, 227 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2000).     Vonn agreed with the\nposition. Vonn, 535 U.S. at 61, 62 n.4.\n\n                                     -6-\n\f(quoting    United   States   v.   Olano,   507      U.S.    725,      732   (1993))\n\n(alterations in original).\n\n            As we noted in United States v. Mescual-Cruz, 387 F.3d 1\n\n(1st Cir. 2004), the decision in Vonn also clarified two areas as\n\nto application of the plain error rule to Rule 11 errors.                     First,\n\nthe burden is on the defendant to make the required showings.                       Id.\n\nat 7.    As Vonn noted, this placement of burdens is necessary to\n\ngive the defendant an incentive to bring an obvious Rule 11 error\n\nto the court's attention when it occurs.              Vonn, 535 U.S. at 73.\n\nSecond, an appellate court may consider the whole record when\n\nconsidering    the   effect   of   the   Rule   11    error      on    defendant's\n\nsubstantial rights, and not simply the record of the plea colloquy.\n\nMescual-Cruz, 387 F.3d at 7.\n\n            Vonn, by its terms, is not restricted to particular types\n\nof Rule 11 errors.     This court has applied Vonn's plain error rule\n\nto claimed Rule 11 errors regarding defendant's understanding of\n\nhis possible sentencing exposure, United States v. Jimenez, 512\n\nF.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2007); defendant's understanding of the charges\n\nand the factual basis for the plea, United States v. Smith, 511\n\nF.3d 77, 85 (1st Cir. 2007); defendant's understanding of a package\n\nplea    agreement,   Mescual-Cruz,    387   F.3d     at     7;   and    a    lack    of\n\nexplanation of the interstate commerce elements of the crime to\n\nwhich defendant was pleading guilty, United States v. Cruz-Rivera,\n\n357 F.3d 10, 12-13 (1st Cir. 2004).         As we read Vonn, it provides\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fno basis for applying a standard other than plain error to a\n\ncourt's failure to address a waiver of appeal (or a waiver of the\n\nright to collaterally attack a sentence) as required by Rule\n\n11(b)(1)(N).    Indeed, other circuits have applied the plain error\n\ntest articulated in Vonn to claims involving violations of Rule\n\n11(b)(1)(N).    See, e.g., United States v. Sura, 511 F.3d 654, 658\n\n(7th Cir. 2007); Murdock, 398 F.3d at 496; Arellano-Gallegos, 387\n\nF.3d at 796; United States v. Edgar, 348 F.3d 867, 871 (10th Cir.\n\n2003).\n\n            In Dominguez Benitez, the Supreme Court set the standards\n\nthat a defendant complaining of an unpreserved Rule 11 error must\n\nmeet on the third prong of the plain error test.              In Dominguez\n\nBenitez, the judge had failed to warn the defendant, as required by\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(3)(B), that he could not withdraw his plea\n\nif    the   court   did   not   accept   the   government's     sentencing\n\nrecommendation, an obvious error.        Dominguez Benitez, 542 U.S. at\n\n78.   The question on which the Court granted review was the showing\n\nthat must be made by a defendant alleging a violation of Rule 11\n\nunder the plain error standard.     The Court held that a defendant is\n\n\"obliged to show a reasonable probability that, but for the [Rule\n\n11] error, he would not have entered the plea.\"         Id. at 76; see\n\nalso Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 59 (1985) (to demonstrate\n\nprejudice in an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, defendant\n\nmust \"show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fcounsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have\n\ninsisted on going to trial\").         It is not enough to ask whether the\n\ndefendant understood the rights at issue when he entered his guilty\n\nplea; courts must consider the effect of an omitted warning on the\n\ndefendant's decision to plead guilty.         Dominguez Benitez, 542 U.S.\n\nat 84.     The Court also stated that the defendant's showing of\n\nprejudice should be causally tied to the precise Rule 11 error\n\nalleged.    Id. at 85.     The Court did not suggest it would vary the\n\nrule depending on the type of Rule 11 violation alleged.\n\n            The   \"reasonable     probability\"      standard   for     showing\n\nprejudice on plain error review of Rule 11 violations is less\n\nonerous    than   a   requirement      that   a    defendant   prove    by    a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that but for the error, things would\n\nhave been different.       See id. at 83 n.9.      One rationale for using\n\nthe \"reasonable probability\" standard for Rule 11 plain error\n\nreview,    instead    of   a   more   burdensome   standard,   may     be    the\n\nrecognition that a defendant will \"rarely, if ever be able to\n\nobtain relief for Rule 11 violations under [28 U.S.C.] § 2255.\"\n\nId.; see also Vonn, 535 U.S. at 63-64; United States v. Timmreck,\n\n441 U.S. 780, 783-84 (1979).\n\n            We have enforced the Dominguez Benitez rule before in\n\nconsidering unpreserved claims that the district court committed\n\nRule 11 error in accepting a plea.            See, e.g., United States v.\n\nCaraballo-Rodriguez, 480 F.3d 62, 76 (1st Cir. 2007); United States\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fv. Matos-Quiñones, 456 F.3d 14, 23 (1st Cir. 2006); United States\n\nv. Delgado-Hernandez, 420 F.3d 16, 28 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                                     III.\n\n            The question here is not whether the waiver of appeal\n\nclause in the plea agreement was initially valid, but whether\n\ndefendant, who could have but did not raise the issue in the\n\ndistrict court, where it could easily have been remedied, has met\n\nthe plain error standard.\n\n            Applying   Vonn,    it   is   clear   that   the   defendant    has\n\nestablished the first two prongs of the plain error rule.                   The\n\nmagistrate judge committed error in his failure to comply with the\n\nclear terms of Rule 11(b)(1)(N), and that error was both obvious\n\nand plain.    Murdock, 398 F.3d at 497; Edgar, 348 F.3d at 871-72;\n\naccord Teeter, 257 F.3d at 24.\n\n            The third prong of the test asks whether defendant has\n\nshown that his substantial rights were affected.                We start the\n\nanalysis of the third prong with the plea agreement and the plea\n\ncolloquy. Relevant considerations include, inter alia, the clarity\n\nof   the   plea   agreement    itself,    defendant's    signature     on   the\n\nagreement and his attestations, defendant's statements at the\n\nchange-of-plea     hearing,    statements    by    counsel     for   both   the\n\ndefendant and the government at the hearing, and the nature of the\n\nquestioning done by the judge at the hearing.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\f            The waiver of appeal clause was clear and self-evident on\n\nits face.    Borrero initialed every page of the plea agreement and\n\nsigned his name at the bottom to indicate that he had \"read the\n\nPlea Agreement and carefully reviewed every part of it with my\n\nattorney,\"   and     that   he   fully   understood   and   was    voluntarily\n\nagreeing to it.\n\n            At the plea colloquy, Borrero stated that he was thirty-\n\neight years old, had an eleventh grade education, was mentally\n\ncompetent, and was suffering from no disability.                  Borrero also\n\nstated affirmatively that (a) he had the opportunity to review and\n\ndiscuss the plea agreement with his attorney; (b) he did not need\n\nadditional time to discuss the agreement with his attorney; (c) he\n\nunderstood all the terms of the plea agreement and no one had made\n\nany promises to him that were not contained in the agreement; (d)\n\nhe understood that the court could accept or reject the agreement,\n\nthat sentencing was within the court's discretion, and what the\n\nstatutory minimum and maximum penalties were; and (e) he had\n\ndiscussed with his attorney and understood that he was waiving\n\nvarious constitutional rights.           Additionally, his attorney stated\n\nthat Borrero was fully competent; that he had met with Borrero on\n\nmultiple occasions to discuss the case and his defense; and that he\n\nhad   provided   a    sentence-by-sentence      translation       of   the   plea\n\nagreement into Spanish for Borrero.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\f            As to Borrero's burden to show prejudice, we look to the\n\n\"entire record, not to the plea proceedings alone.\"                       Dominguez\n\nBenitez, 542 U.S. at 80; see also Caraballo-Rodriguez, 480 F.3d at\n\n76.   Here     the government had a strong case and Borrero had\n\ncompelling     reasons    to   make   a    deal   and   reduce    his    sentencing\n\nexposure.      Borrero received the exact sentence recommended by the\n\nplea agreement.        Borrero, with good reason, does not even attempt\n\nan argument that he would not have entered the plea had he been\n\naware he was waiving his appellate rights.               Indeed, it is hard to\n\nsee how the omission of the appellate waiver warning from the bench\n\nhad any effect on his decision to plead guilty.                    See Dominguez\n\nBenitez, 542 U.S. at 85; Caraballo-Rodriguez, 480 F.3d at 76.\n\nWhether or not Borrero's decision to plead guilty was foolish (and\n\nit does not seem to be), the \"point . . . is not to second-guess a\n\ndefendant's actual decision.\"             Dominguez Benitez, 542 U.S. at 85.\n\n            Some courts have held that where there is no discussion\n\nof an appellate waiver clause at the plea hearing and there is an\n\nabsence   of    \"any    indication    on    the   record   that    the   defendant\n\nunderstood that he had a right to appeal and he was giving up that\n\nright,\" that will suffice to satisfy the third prong of the plain\n\nerror test.     Murdock, 398 F.3d at 497; see also Arellano-Gallegos,\n\n387 F.3d at 797 (same).        This view is, we think, inconsistent with\n\nboth Vonn and Dominguez Benitez.            It is defendant's burden to show\n\nthat the waiver of appellate rights was deficient and that he would\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fotherwise not have pled guilty. If the record contains no evidence\n\nin defendant's favor, his claim fails.   See Dominguez Benitez, 542\n\nU.S. at 82; Vonn, 535 U.S. at 62-63; cf. Edgar, 348 F.3d at 872-73.\n\n          There may well be cases where a defendant can show he did\n\nnot understand that he was waiving his appellate rights, and that\n\nhad he understood the appellate waiver clause, he would not have\n\npled guilty.   A panel in the Seventh Circuit, over a dissent, found\n\nthat to be the situation in United States v. Sura, which also\n\ninvolved a Rule 11(b)(1)(N) error. But there were other indicia in\n\nthat case not present here: the seventy-one-year-old defendant, who\n\nwas undergoing mental health treatment, gave confused responses to\n\nthe district court, and the appellate court said it doubted, on the\n\nrecord, whether he would have entered the plea \"had he realized\n\nthat he was losing his chance to challenge the district court's\n\nsentencing decision, which was based primarily on crimes unrelated\n\nto the crime of conviction and gave little weight to Sura's\n\nindividual circumstances.\"   Sura, 511 F.3d at 662.   Nothing of the\n\nsort exists here.   Borrero has not shown that he did not know or\n\nunderstand that he had waived his appellate rights or that he would\n\nnot have pled guilty had he realized he was waiving his appellate\n\nrights.\n\n          We do not reach Borrero's underlying merits argument\n\nabout this being a package plea.   \"[A]n inquiry into the merits is\n\nexactly what a waiver of appeal blocks.\"   Id. at 668 (Easterbrook,\n\n\n                                -13-\n\fJ., dissenting).   As the Supreme Court said in Dominguez Benitez,\n\nrelief from a guilty plea \"will be difficult to get, as it should\n\nbe.\"   Dominguez Benitez, 542 U.S. at 83 n.9.\n\n           There is one final point. In light of Vonn and Dominguez\n\nBenitez, one might question what is left of this circuit's former\n\nrule on enforceabililty of waiver of appeal clauses, announced in\n\nUnited States v. Teeter.    In Teeter, we held that pre-sentence\n\nwaivers of appellate rights were valid in theory, but given the\n\nattendant dangers, we would require such waivers to meet stringent\n\nconditions:\n\n           Our basic premise, therefore, is that if\n           denying a right of appeal would work a\n           miscarriage of justice, the appellate court,\n           in its sound discretion, may refuse to honor\n           the waiver. As a subset of this premise, we\n           think that the same flexibility ought to\n           pertain when the district court plainly errs\n           in sentencing.\n\nTeeter, 257 F.3d at 25 (footnote omitted); see also Newbert, 504\n\nF.3d at 189 (Boudin, J., concurring) (defendant may be relieved of\n\na waiver of the right to appeal by district judge where enforcing\n\nthe waiver would effect a miscarriage of justice).\n\n           More precisely, the question after Vonn and Dominguez\n\nBenitez is whether there is any discretionary power left in this\n\ncourt to decline to enforce a waiver of appeal clause where we\n\nconclude that enforcing the waiver would be a miscarriage of\n\njustice.   The question may well be a hypothetical one; it is not\n\n\n\n                               -14-\n\fclear such situations would exist where a defendant could not also\n\nmeet all four prongs of the plain error rule.\n\n          In Timmreck, the Supreme Court left room for a defendant\n\non collateral review to show that the Rule 11 proceeding either\n\nconstituted   a   \"complete    miscarriage   of   justice\"   or   was\n\n\"inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure.\"\n\nTimmreck, 441 U.S. at 783 (quoting Hill v.

Dominguez Benitez,</i> 542 U.S. 74, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004); <i>United States v. Vonn,</i> 535 U.S. 55, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002); <i>cf. </i><i>United States v. Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d 14 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n<p>In doing so, we join the other circuits to have considered the question and hold that the plain error standard applies to unpreserved claims of violations of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1)(N), albeit our understanding of the plain error rule seems to differ from some. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Murdock,</i> 398 F.3d 491, 496 (6th Cir.2005); <i>United States v. Arellano-Gallegos,</i> 387 F.3d 794, 797 (9th Cir.2004). The defendant must show, as part of his <span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> demonstration that his substantial rights were affected, a reasonable probability that he would not have entered the plea had the error not been made.</p>\n<p>We conclude that defendant has not met his burden, and the waiver of appeal clause at issue here is to be enforced. As a result, we do not reach defendant's underlying arguments that the plea is invalid for other reasons.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>On July 20, 2005, in a one-count indictment covering him and eleven co-defendants, Juan Borrero-Acevedo was charged with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine and one kilogram or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A), 846. The indictment identified Borrero as one of the suppliers for the conspiracy's drug points. After initially pleading not guilty, Borrero filed a motion to change his plea, which was referred to a magistrate judge.</p>\n<p>The change-of-plea hearing was conducted on June 9, 2006, by a magistrate judge. Borrero entered a guilty plea pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1)(A) and (B) and an agreement with the government. The plea agreement stated, and the government testified at the hearing, that at trial the government would have presented evidence establishing that, from 1999 to the date of the indictment, the defendant participated in the distribution of cocaine and heroin in the La Via sector at Aguadilla, Puerto Rico. During this time, defendant was considered a supply source for heroin in La Via and was involved in at least one drug transaction there. He conspired to sell between 700 grams and one kilogram of heroin in furtherance of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p>Borrero benefitted from the plea agreement he had reached with the government. Based on the charges in the indictment, Borrero was subject to a minimum ten-year sentence. Pursuant to the plea agreement, the government recommended an eighty-seven month prison term, which was the sentence the court imposed. The plea agreement contained a simple and easily understood waiver of appeal. This waiver stated: \"The defendant hereby agrees that if this Honorable Court accepts this agreement and sentences him according to its terms and conditions, defendant waives and surrenders his right to appeal the judgment and sentence in this case.\"</p>\n<p>In 1999, Congress added to Rule 11 what would become section (b)(1)(N), which requires the court both to inform the defendant of and to determine that the defendant understands \"the terms of any plea-agreement provision waiving the right to appeal or to collaterally attack the sentence.\"<sup>[1]</sup> Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1)(N). The purpose of the amendment was to ensure that waivers of appellate rights are knowing and voluntary. <i>See id.</i> 11 advisory committee's note (\"1999 Amendments\"). When Rule 11(b)(1)(N) was added, it became subject to the terms of Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(h) that \"[a] variance from the requirements of this rule is harmless error if it does not affect substantial rights.\" This language is similar to the harmless error rule in Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> It is undisputed here that the magistrate judge failed to comply with the requirements of Rule 11(b)(1)(N) during the colloquy with the defendant at the change-of-plea hearing. The prosecutor also failed to point out the waiver during the colloquy.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Borrero could have attempted, based on this omission, to withdraw his guilty plea in the trial court before sentencing. <i>See id.</i> 11(d)(2)(B). Had he done so, he would have had to show only a \"fair and just reason for withdrawal.\" <i>Id.; see also, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Newbert,</i> 504 F.3d 180, 183-84 (1st Cir.2007) (affirming decision of trial court not to enforce waiver of rights where defendant had been permitted to withdraw his plea under Rule 11(d)(2)(B)). Having raised the omission for the first time on appeal, Borrero faces a much tougher standard.</p>\n<p>Borrero argues that the magistrate judge's failure to ask him specifically about the waiver of appeal means that he is not bound by this waiver. Not so.<sup>[3]</sup> Borrero's primary argument is that it would be unjust to hold him to the waiver of appeal because this would block him from making his argument on the merits, which is that insufficient attention was paid to whether his plea was voluntary given that it was part of a package deal and he might have been coerced into pleading guilty by a co-defendant.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p><i>Vonn</i> resolved a circuit split<sup>[4]</sup> on the standard for evaluating Rule 11 errors. It held that a defendant who has not preserved his claim of Rule 11 error and wishes to be relieved of his guilty plea on appeal must satisfy the plain error standard of Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b). <i>Vonn,</i> 535 U.S. at 58-59, 122 S.Ct. 1043.</p>\n<p>In order to show plain error, a defendant must demonstrate that there is \"(1) `error,' (2) that is `plain,' and (3) that `affect[s] substantial rights.' If all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error `seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.'\" <i>Johnson v. United States,</i> 520 U.S. 461, 467, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997) (quoting <i>United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)) (alterations in original).</p>\n<p>As we noted in <i>United States v. Mescual-Cruz,</i> 387 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.2004), the decision in <i>Vonn</i> also clarified two areas as to application of the plain error rule to Rule 11 errors. First, the burden is on the defendant to make the required showings. <i>Id.</i> at 7. As <i>Vonn</i> noted, this placement of burdens is necessary to give <span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> the defendant an incentive to bring an obvious Rule 11 error to the court's attention when it occurs. <i>Vonn,</i> 535 U.S. at 73, 122 S.Ct. 1043. Second, an appellate court may consider the whole record when considering the effect of the Rule 11 error on defendant's substantial rights, and not simply the record of the plea colloquy. <i>Mescual-Cruz,</i> 387 F.3d at 7.</p>\n<p><i>Vonn,</i> by its terms, is not restricted to particular types of Rule 11 errors. This court has applied <i>Vonn</i>'s plain error rule to claimed Rule 11 errors regarding defendant's understanding of his possible sentencing exposure, <i>United States v. Jimenez,</i> 512 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.2007); defendant's understanding of the charges and the factual basis for the plea, <i>United States v. Smith,</i> 511 F.3d 77, 85 (1st Cir. 2007); defendant's understanding of a package plea agreement, <i>Mescual-Cruz,</i> 387 F.3d at 7; and a lack of explanation of the interstate commerce elements of the crime to which defendant was pleading guilty, <i>United States v. Cruz-Rivera,</i> 357 F.3d 10, 12-13 (1st Cir.2004). As we read <i>Vonn,</i> it provides no basis for applying a standard other than plain error to a court's failure to address a waiver of appeal (or a waiver of the right to collaterally attack a sentence) as required by Rule 11(b)(1)(N). Indeed, other circuits have applied the plain error test articulated in <i>Vonn</i> to claims involving violations of Rule 11(b)(1)(N). <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Sura,</i> 511 F.3d 654, 658 (7th Cir.2007); <i>Murdock,</i> 398 F.3d at 496; <i>Arellano-Gallegos,</i> 387 F.3d at 796; <i>United States v. Edgar,</i> 348 F.3d 867, 871 (10th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p>In <i>Dominguez Benitez,</i> the Supreme Court set the standards that a defendant complaining of an unpreserved Rule 11 error must meet on the third prong of the plain error test. In <i>Dominguez Benitez,</i> the judge had failed to warn the defendant, as required by Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(c)(3)(B), that he could not withdraw his plea if the court did not accept the government's sentencing recommendation, an obvious error. <i>Dominguez Benitez,</i> 542 U.S. at 78, 124 S.Ct. 2333. The question on which the Court granted review was the showing that must be made by a defendant alleging a violation of Rule 11 under the plain error standard. The Court held that a defendant is \"obliged to show a reasonable probability that, but for the [Rule 11] error, he would not have entered the plea.\" <i>Id.</i> at 76, 124 S.Ct. 2333; <i>see also </i><i>Hill v. Lockhart,</i> 474 U.S. 52, 59, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985) (to demonstrate prejudice in an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, defendant must \"show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial\"). It is not enough to ask whether the defendant understood the rights at issue when he entered his guilty plea; courts must consider the effect of an omitted warning on the defendant's decision to plead guilty. <i>Dominguez Benitez,</i> 542 U.S. at 84, 124 S.Ct. 2333. The Court also stated that the defendant's showing of prejudice should be causally tied to the precise Rule 11 error alleged. <i>Id.</i> at 85, 124 S.Ct. 2333. The Court did not suggest it would vary the rule depending on the type of Rule 11 violation alleged.</p>\n<p>The \"reasonable probability\" standard for showing prejudice on plain error review of Rule 11 violations is less onerous than a requirement that a defendant prove by a preponderance of the evidence that but for the error, things would have been different. <i>See id.</i> at 83 n. 9, 124 S.Ct. 2333. One rationale for using the \"reasonable probability\" standard for Rule 11 plain error review, instead of a more burdensome standard, may be the recognition <span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> that a defendant will \"rarely, if ever be able to obtain relief for Rule 11 violations under [28 U.S.C.] § 2255.\" <i>Id.</i>; <i>see also </i><i>Vonn,</i> 535 U.S. at 63-64, 122 S.Ct. 1043; <i>United States v. Timmreck,</i> 441 U.S. 780, 783-84, 99 S.Ct. 2085, 60 L.Ed.2d 634 (1979).</p>\n<p>We have enforced the <i>Dominguez Benitez</i> rule before in considering unpreserved claims that the district court committed Rule 11 error in accepting a plea. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Caraballo-Rodriguez,</i> 480 F.3d 62, 76 (1st Cir.2007); <i>United States v. Matos-Quiñones,</i> 456 F.3d 14, 23 (1st Cir.2006); <i>United States v. Delgado-Hernandez,</i> 420 F.3d 16, 28 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>The question here is not whether the waiver of appeal clause in the plea agreement was initially valid, but whether defendant, who could have but did not raise the issue in the district court, where it could easily have been remedied, has met the plain error standard.</p>\n<p>Applying <i>Vonn,</i> it is clear that the defendant has established the first two prongs of the plain error rule. The magistrate judge committed error in his failure to comply with the clear terms of Rule 11(b)(1)(N), and that error was both obvious and plain. <i>Murdock,</i> 398 F.3d at 497; <i>Edgar,</i> 348 F.3d at 871-72; <i>accord </i><i>Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d at 24.</p>\n<p>The third prong of the test asks whether defendant has shown that his substantial rights were affected. We start the analysis of the third prong with the plea agreement and the plea colloquy. Relevant considerations include, inter alia, the clarity of the plea agreement itself, defendant's signature on the agreement and his attestations, defendant's statements at the change-of-plea hearing, statements by counsel for both the defendant and the government at the hearing, and the nature of the questioning done by the judge at the hearing.</p>\n<p>The waiver of appeal clause was clear and self-evident on its face. Borrero initialed every page of the plea agreement and signed his name at the bottom to indicate that he had \"read the Plea Agreement and carefully reviewed every part of it with my attorney,\" and that he fully understood and was voluntarily agreeing to it.</p>\n<p>At the plea colloquy, Borrero stated that he was thirty-eight years old, had an eleventh grade education, was mentally competent, and was suffering from no disability. Borrero also stated affirmatively that (a) he had the opportunity to review and discuss the plea agreement with his attorney; (b) he did not need additional time to discuss the agreement with his attorney; (c) he understood all the terms of the plea agreement and no one had made any promises to him that were not contained in the agreement; (d) he understood that the court could accept or reject the agreement, that sentencing was within the court's discretion, and what the statutory minimum and maximum penalties were; and (e) he had discussed with his attorney and understood that he was waiving various constitutional rights. Additionally, his attorney stated that Borrero was fully competent; that he had met with Borrero on multiple occasions to discuss the case and his defense; and that he had provided a sentence-by-sentence translation of the plea agreement into Spanish for Borrero.</p>\n<p>As to Borrero's burden to show prejudice, we look to the \"entire record, not to the plea proceedings alone.\" <i>Dominguez Benitez,</i> 542 U.S. at 80, 124 S.Ct. 2333; <i>see also </i><i>Caraballo-Rodriguez,</i> 480 F.3d at 76. Here the government had a strong case and Borrero had compelling <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> reasons to make a deal and reduce his sentencing exposure. Borrero received the exact sentence recommended by the plea agreement. Borrero, with good reason, does not even attempt an argument that he would not have entered the plea had he been aware he was waiving his appellate rights. Indeed, it is hard to see how the omission of the appellate waiver warning from the bench had any effect on his decision to plead guilty. <i>See </i><i>Dominguez Benitez,</i> 542 U.S. at 85, 124 S.Ct. 2333; <i>Caraballo-Rodriguez,</i> 480 F.3d at 76. Whether or not Borrero's decision to plead guilty was foolish (and it does not seem to be), the \"point ... is not to second-guess a defendant's actual decision.\" <i>Dominguez Benitez,</i> 542 U.S. at 85, 124 S.Ct. 2333.</p>\n<p>Some courts have held that where there is no discussion of an appellate waiver clause at the plea hearing and there is an absence of \"any indication on the record that the defendant understood that he had a right to appeal and he was giving up that right,\" that will suffice to satisfy the third prong of the plain error test. <i>Murdock,</i> 398 F.3d at 497; <i>see also </i><i>Arellano-Gallegos,</i> 387 F.3d at 797 (same). This view is, we think, inconsistent with both <i>Vonn</i> and <i>Dominguez Benitez.</i> It is defendant's burden to show that the waiver of appellate rights was deficient and that he would otherwise not have pled guilty. If the record contains no evidence in defendant's favor, his claim fails. <i>See </i><i>Dominguez Benitez,</i> 542 U.S. at 82, 124 S.Ct. 2333; <i>Vonn,</i> 535 U.S. at 62-63, 122 S.Ct. 1043; <i>cf. </i><i>Edgar,</i> 348 F.3d at 872-73.</p>\n<p>There may well be cases where a defendant can show he did not understand that he was waiving his appellate rights, and that had he understood the appellate waiver clause, he would not have pled guilty. A panel in the Seventh Circuit, over a dissent, found that to be the situation in <i>United States v. Sura</i><i>,</i> which also involved a Rule 11(b)(1)(N) error. But there were other indicia in that case not present here: the seventy-one-year-old defendant, who was undergoing mental health treatment, gave confused responses to the district court, and the appellate court said it doubted, on the record, whether he would have entered the plea \"had he realized that he was losing his chance to challenge the district court's sentencing decision, which was based primarily on crimes unrelated to the crime of conviction and gave little weight to Sura's individual circumstances.\" <i>Sura,</i> 511 F.3d at 662. Nothing of the sort exists here. Borrero has not shown that he did not know or understand that he had waived his appellate rights or that he would not have pled guilty had he realized he was waiving his appellate rights.</p>\n<p>We do not reach Borrero's underlying merits argument about this being a package plea. \"[A]n inquiry into the merits is exactly what a waiver of appeal blocks.\" <i>Id.</i> at 668 (Easterbrook, J., dissenting). As the Supreme Court said in <i>Dominguez Benitez,</i> relief from a guilty plea \"will be difficult to get, as it should be.\" <i>Dominguez Benitez,</i> 542 U.S. at 83 n. 9, 124 S.Ct. 2333.</p>\n<p>There is one final point.

The Supreme Court has not directly addressed this question in the context of Rule 11 errors regarding appellate waiver clauses, and we do not address it here.

This court is not bound by a party's concessions. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Mescual-Cruz,</i> 387 F.3d 1, 8 n. 2 (1st Cir.2004). The court directed the parties to file supplemental briefs on the waiver issue, calling their attention to the case law on point. Thereafter, the United States filed a supplemental brief reversing its position and arguing that defendant was bound by his appellate waiver because he had not met the third prong of the plain error test.</p>\n<p>[4]  Before <i>Vonn,</i> this court had held that unpreserved claims of Rule 11 error were subject to plain error review under Rule 52(b), and not harmless error review. <i>See </i><i>United States v.

As a result, we do not reach defendant's underlying arguments that the plea is invalid for other reasons.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>On July 20, 2005, in a one-count indictment covering him and eleven co-defendants, Juan Borrero-Acevedo was charged with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine and one kilogram or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A), 846. The indictment identified Borrero as one of the suppliers for the conspiracy's drug points. After initially pleading not guilty, Borrero filed a motion to change his plea, which was referred to a magistrate judge.</p>\n<p>The change-of-plea hearing was conducted on June 9, 2006, by a magistrate judge. Borrero entered a guilty plea pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1)(A) and (B) and an agreement with the government. The plea agreement stated, and the government testified at the hearing, that at trial the government would have presented evidence establishing that, from 1999 to the date of the indictment, the defendant participated in the distribution of cocaine and heroin in the La Via sector at Aguadilla, Puerto Rico. During this time, defendant was considered a supply source for heroin in La Via and was involved in at least one drug transaction there. He conspired to sell between 700 grams and one kilogram of heroin in furtherance of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p>Borrero benefitted from the plea agreement he had reached with the government. Based on the charges in the indictment, Borrero was subject to a minimum ten-year sentence. Pursuant to the plea agreement, the government recommended an eighty-seven month prison term, which was the sentence the court imposed. The plea agreement contained a simple and easily understood waiver of appeal. This waiver stated: \"The defendant hereby agrees that if this Honorable Court accepts this agreement and sentences him according to its terms and conditions, defendant waives and surrenders his right to appeal the judgment and sentence in this case.\"</p>\n<p>In 1999, Congress added to Rule 11 what would become section (b)(1)(N), which requires the court both to inform the defendant of and to determine that the defendant understands \"the terms of any plea-agreement provision waiving the right to appeal or to collaterally attack the sentence.\"<sup>[1]</sup> Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1)(N). The purpose of the amendment was to ensure that waivers of appellate rights are knowing and voluntary. <i>See id.</i> 11 advisory committee's note (\"1999 Amendments\"). When Rule 11(b)(1)(N) was added, it became subject to the terms of Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(h) that \"[a] variance from the requirements of this rule is harmless error if it does not affect substantial rights.\" This language is similar to the harmless error rule in Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> It is undisputed here that the magistrate judge failed to comply with the requirements of Rule 11(b)(1)(N) during the colloquy with the defendant at the change-of-plea hearing. The prosecutor also failed to point out the waiver during the colloquy.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Borrero could have attempted, based on this omission, to withdraw his guilty plea in the trial court before sentencing. <i>See id.</i> 11(d)(2)(B). Had he done so, he would have had to show only a \"fair and just reason for withdrawal.\" <i>Id.; see also, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Newbert,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202973\"><a href=\"/opinion/202973/united-states-v-newbert/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">180</span></a></span>, 183-84 (1st Cir.2007) (affirming decision of trial court not to enforce waiver of rights where defendant had been permitted to withdraw his plea under Rule 11(d)(2)(B)). Having raised the omission for the first time on appeal, Borrero faces a much tougher standard.</p>\n<p>Borrero argues that the magistrate judge's failure to ask him specifically about the waiver of appeal means that he is not bound by this waiver. Not so.<sup>[3]</sup> Borrero's primary argument is that it would be unjust to hold him to the waiver of appeal because this would block him from making his argument on the merits, which is that insufficient attention was paid to whether his plea was voluntary given that it was part of a package deal and he might have been coerced into pleading guilty by a co-defendant.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p><i>Vonn</i> resolved a circuit split<sup>[4]</sup> on the standard for evaluating Rule 11 errors. It held that a defendant who has not preserved his claim of Rule 11 error and wishes to be relieved of his guilty plea on appeal must satisfy the plain error standard of Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b). <i>Vonn,</i> 535 U.S. at 58-59, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118487\"><a href=\"/opinion/118487/united-states-v-vonn/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

First, the burden is on the defendant to make the required showings. <i>Id.</i> at 7. As <i>Vonn</i> noted, this placement of burdens is necessary to give <span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> the defendant an incentive to bring an obvious Rule 11 error to the court's attention when it occurs. <i>Vonn,</i> 535 U.S. at 73, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118487\"><a href=\"/opinion/118487/united-states-v-vonn/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1043</span></a></span>. Second, an appellate court may consider the whole record when considering the effect of the Rule 11 error on defendant's substantial rights, and not simply the record of the plea colloquy. <i>Mescual-Cruz,</i> 387 F.3d at 7.</p>\n<p><i>Vonn,</i> by its terms, is not restricted to particular types of Rule 11 errors. This court has applied <i>Vonn</i>'s plain error rule to claimed Rule 11 errors regarding defendant's understanding of his possible sentencing exposure, <i>United States v. Jimenez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203091\"><a href=\"/opinion/203091/united-states-v-jimenez/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir.2007); defendant's understanding of the charges and the factual basis for the plea, <i>United States v. Smith,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203086\"><a href=\"/opinion/203086/united-states-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">77</span></a></span>, 85 (1st Cir. 2007); defendant's understanding of a package plea agreement, <i>Mescual-Cruz,</i> 387 F.3d at 7; and a lack of explanation of the interstate commerce elements of the crime to which defendant was pleading guilty, <i>United States v. Cruz-Rivera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200821\"><a href=\"/opinion/200821/united-states-v-cruz-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">357</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, 12-13 (1st Cir.2004). As we read <i>Vonn,</i> it provides no basis for applying a standard other than plain error to a court's failure to address a waiver of appeal (or a waiver of the right to collaterally attack a sentence) as required by Rule 11(b)(1)(N). Indeed, other circuits have applied the plain error test articulated in <i>Vonn</i> to claims involving violations of Rule 11(b)(1)(N). <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Sura,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1194813\"><a href=\"/opinion/1194813/united-states-v-sura/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">654</span></a></span>, 658 (7th Cir.2007); <i>Murdock,</i> 398 F.3d at 496; <i>Arellano-Gallegos,</i> 387 F.3d at 796; <i>United States v.

In <i>Dominguez Benitez,</i> the judge had failed to warn the defendant, as required by Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(c)(3)(B), that he could not withdraw his plea if the court did not accept the government's sentencing recommendation, an obvious error. <i>Dominguez Benitez,</i> 542 U.S. at 78, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136986\"><a href=\"/opinion/136986/united-states-v-dominguez-benitez/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2333</span></a></span>. The question on which the Court granted review was the showing that must be made by a defendant alleging a violation of Rule 11 under the plain error standard. The Court held that a defendant is \"obliged to show a reasonable probability that, but for the [Rule 11] error, he would not have entered the plea.\" <i>Id.</i> at 76, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136986\"><a href=\"/opinion/136986/united-states-v-dominguez-benitez/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span></a></span> (1985) (to demonstrate prejudice in an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, defendant must \"show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial\"). It is not enough to ask whether the defendant understood the rights at issue when he entered his guilty plea; courts must consider the effect of an omitted warning on the defendant's decision to plead guilty. <i>Dominguez Benitez,</i> 542 U.S. at 84, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136986\"><a href=\"/opinion/136986/united-states-v-dominguez-benitez/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2333</span></a></span>. The Court also stated that the defendant's showing of prejudice should be causally tied to the precise Rule 11 error alleged. <i>Id.</i> at 85, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136986\"><a href=\"/opinion/136986/united-states-v-dominguez-benitez/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2333</span></a></span>. The Court did not suggest it would vary the rule depending on the type of Rule 11 violation alleged.</p>\n<p>The \"reasonable probability\" standard for showing prejudice on plain error review of Rule 11 violations is less onerous than a requirement that a defendant prove by a preponderance of the evidence that but for the error, things would have been different. <i>See id.</i> at 83 n. 9, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136986\"><a href=\"/opinion/136986/united-states-v-dominguez-benitez/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2333</span></a></span>. One rationale for using the \"reasonable probability\" standard for Rule 11 plain error review, instead of a more burdensome standard, may be the recognition <span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> that a defendant will \"rarely, if ever be able to obtain relief for Rule 11 violations under [28 U.S.C.] § 2255.\" <i>Id.</i>; <i>see also </i><i>Vonn,</i> 535 U.S. at 63-64, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118487\"><a href=\"/opinion/118487/united-states-v-vonn/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The magistrate judge committed error in his failure to comply with the clear terms of Rule 11(b)(1)(N), and that error was both obvious and plain. <i>Murdock,</i> 398 F.3d at 497; <i>Edgar,</i> 348 F.3d at 871-72; <i>accord </i><i>Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d at 24.</p>\n<p>The third prong of the test asks whether defendant has shown that his substantial rights were affected. We start the analysis of the third prong with the plea agreement and the plea colloquy. Relevant considerations include, inter alia, the clarity of the plea agreement itself, defendant's signature on the agreement and his attestations, defendant's statements at the change-of-plea hearing, statements by counsel for both the defendant and the government at the hearing, and the nature of the questioning done by the judge at the hearing.</p>\n<p>The waiver of appeal clause was clear and self-evident on its face. Borrero initialed every page of the plea agreement and signed his name at the bottom to indicate that he had \"read the Plea Agreement and carefully reviewed every part of it with my attorney,\" and that he fully understood and was voluntarily agreeing to it.</p>\n<p>At the plea colloquy, Borrero stated that he was thirty-eight years old, had an eleventh grade education, was mentally competent, and was suffering from no disability. Borrero also stated affirmatively that (a) he had the opportunity to review and discuss the plea agreement with his attorney; (b) he did not need additional time to discuss the agreement with his attorney; (c) he understood all the terms of the plea agreement and no one had made any promises to him that were not contained in the agreement; (d) he understood that the court could accept or reject the agreement, that sentencing was within the court's discretion, and what the statutory minimum and maximum penalties were; and (e) he had discussed with his attorney and understood that he was waiving various constitutional rights. Additionally, his attorney stated that Borrero was fully competent; that he had met with Borrero on multiple occasions to discuss the case and his defense; and that he had provided a sentence-by-sentence translation of the plea agreement into Spanish for Borrero.</p>\n<p>As to Borrero's burden to show prejudice, we look to the \"entire record, not to the plea proceedings alone.\" <i>Dominguez Benitez,</i> 542 U.S. at 80, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136986\"><a href=\"/opinion/136986/united-states-v-dominguez-benitez/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2333</span></a></span>; <i>see also </i><i>Caraballo-Rodriguez,</i> 480 F.3d at 76. Here the government had a strong case and Borrero had compelling <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> reasons to make a deal and reduce his sentencing exposure. Borrero received the exact sentence recommended by the plea agreement. Borrero, with good reason, does not even attempt an argument that he would not have entered the plea had he been aware he was waiving his appellate rights. Indeed, it is hard to see how the omission of the appellate waiver warning from the bench had any effect on his decision to plead guilty. <i>See </i><i>Dominguez Benitez,</i> 542 U.S. at 85, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136986\"><a href=\"/opinion/136986/united-states-v-dominguez-benitez/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2333</span></a></span>; <i>Caraballo-Rodriguez,</i> 480 F.3d at 76. Whether or not Borrero's decision to plead guilty was foolish (and it does not seem to be), the \"point ... is not to second-guess a defendant's actual decision.\" <i>Dominguez Benitez,</i> 542 U.S. at 85, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136986\"><a href=\"/opinion/136986/united-states-v-dominguez-benitez/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2333</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>Some courts have held that where there is no discussion of an appellate waiver clause at the plea hearing and there is an absence of \"any indication on the record that the defendant understood that he had a right to appeal and he was giving up that right,\" that will suffice to satisfy the third prong of the plain error test. <i>Murdock,</i> 398 F.3d at 497; <i>see also </i><i>Arellano-Gallegos,</i> 387 F.3d at 797 (same). This view is, we think, inconsistent with both <i>Vonn</i> and <i>Dominguez Benitez.</i> It is defendant's burden to show that the waiver of appellate rights was deficient and that he would otherwise not have pled guilty. If the record contains no evidence in defendant's favor, his claim fails. <i>See </i><i>Dominguez Benitez,</i> 542 U.S. at 82, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136986\"><a href=\"/opinion/136986/united-states-v-dominguez-benitez/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2333</span></a></span>; <i>Vonn,</i> 535 U.S. at 62-63, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118487\"><a href=\"/opinion/118487/united-states-v-vonn/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1043</span></a></span>; <i>cf. </i><i>Edgar,</i> 348 F.3d at 872-73.</p>\n<p>There may well be cases where a defendant can show he did not understand that he was waiving his appellate rights, and that had he understood the appellate waiver clause, he would not have pled guilty. A panel in the Seventh Circuit, over a dissent, found that to be the situation in <i>United States v. Sura</i><i>,</i> which also involved a Rule 11(b)(1)(N) error. But there were other indicia in that case not present here: the seventy-one-year-old defendant, who was undergoing mental health treatment, gave confused responses to the district court, and the appellate court said it doubted, on the record, whether he would have entered the plea \"had he realized that he was losing his chance to challenge the district court's sentencing decision, which was based primarily on crimes unrelated to the crime of conviction and gave little weight to Sura's individual circumstances.\" <i>Sura,</i> 511 F.3d at 662. Nothing of the sort exists here. Borrero has not shown that he did not know or understand that he had waived his appellate rights or that he would not have pled guilty had he realized he was waiving his appellate rights.</p>\n<p>We do not reach Borrero's underlying merits argument about this being a package plea. \"[A]n inquiry into the merits is exactly what a waiver of appeal blocks.\" <i>Id.</i> at 668 (Easterbrook, J., dissenting). As the Supreme Court said in <i>Dominguez Benitez,</i> relief from a guilty plea \"will be difficult to get, as it should be.\" <i>Dominguez Benitez,</i> 542 U.S. at 83 n. 9, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136986\"><a href=\"/opinion/136986/united-states-v-dominguez-benitez/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2333</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>There is one final point. In light of <i>Vonn</i> and <i>Dominguez Benitez,</i> one might question what is left of this circuit's former rule on enforceabililty of waiver of appeal clauses, announced in <i>United States v. Teeter</i><i>.</i> In <i>Teeter,</i> we held that pre-sentence waivers of appellate rights were valid in theory, but given the attendant dangers, we would require such waivers to meet stringent conditions:</p>\n<blockquote>Our basic premise, therefore, is that if denying a right of appeal would work a miscarriage of justice, the appellate court, in its sound discretion, may refuse to honor the waiver. As a subset of this premise, we <span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> think that the same flexibility ought to pertain when the district court plainly errs in sentencing.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d at 25 (footnote omitted); <i>see also </i><i>Newbert,</i> 504 F.3d at 189 (Boudin, J., concurring) (defendant may be relieved of a waiver of the right to appeal by district judge where enforcing the waiver would effect a miscarriage of justice).</p>\n<p>More precisely, the question after <i>Vonn</i> and <i>Dominguez Benitez</i> is whether there is any discretionary power left in this court to decline to enforce a waiver of appeal clause where we conclude that enforcing the waiver would be a miscarriage of justice. The question may well be a hypothetical one; it is not clear such situations would exist where a defendant could not also meet all four prongs of the plain error rule.</p>\n<p>In <i>Timmreck,</i> the Supreme Court left room for a defendant on collateral review to show that the Rule 11 proceeding either constituted a \"complete miscarriage of justice\" or was \"inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure.\" <i>Timmreck,</i> 441 U.S. at 783, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110080\"><a href=\"/opinion/110080/united-states-v-timmreck/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2085</span></a></span> (quoting <i>Hill v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106329\"><a href=\"/opinion/106329/hill-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">368</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></a></span>, 427, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106329\"><a href=\"/opinion/106329/hill-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">468</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106329\"><a href=\"/opinion/106329/hill-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">417</span></a></span> (1962)) (internal quotation marks omitted). This suggests such exceptions might also be available on direct review. The Supreme Court has not directly addressed this question in the context of Rule 11 errors regarding appellate waiver clauses, and we do not address it here. If such a case exists in fact, and not in hypothetical, we will address the issue then.</p>\n<p>We enforce the waiver of appeal and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Hon. Sandra Day O'Connor, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the Supreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The provision states:\n</p>\n<p>Before the court accepts a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, the defendant may be placed under oath, and the court must address the defendant personally in open court. During this address, the court must inform the defendant of, and determine that the defendant understands, ... the terms of any plea-agreement provision waiving the right to appeal or to collaterally attack the sentence.</p>\n<p>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1)(N).</p>\n<p>[2]  As a matter of efficiency and securing finality, prosecutors would be well-advised to call such omissions to the attention of the court at change-of-plea hearings.</p>\n<p>[3]  In its initial brief, the United States took the position that because there had been no mention of the appellate waiver at the plea colloquy, the waiver could not be enforced. This court is not bound by a party's concessions. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Mescual-Cruz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201289\"><a href=\"/opinion/201289/united-states-v-mescual-cruz/\"><span class=\"volume\">387</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 8 n. 2 (1st Cir.2004). The court directed the parties to file supplemental briefs on the waiver issue, calling their attention to the case law on point. Thereafter, the United States filed a supplemental brief reversing its position and arguing that defendant was bound by his appellate waiver because he had not met the third prong of the plain error test.</p>\n<p>[4]  Before <i>Vonn,</i> this court had held that unpreserved claims of Rule 11 error were subject to plain error review under Rule 52(b), and not harmless error review. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Gandia-Maysonet,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199077\"><a href=\"/opinion/199077/united-states-v-gandia-maysonet/\"><span class=\"volume\">227</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir. 2000). <i>Vonn</i> agreed with the position. <i>Vonn,</i> 535 U.S. at 61, 62 n. 4, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118487\"><a href=\"/opinion/118487/united-states-v-vonn/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
