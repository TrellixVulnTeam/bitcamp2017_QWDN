JOHNSON,\n\n                      Respondent, Appellant.\n\n\n\n\n          APPEALS FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n          [Hon. Joseph L. Tauro,        U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                   Torruella, Lipez and Howard,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Barbara C. Johnson on brief pro se.\n\n\n\n                             June 16, 2009\n\f     Per Curiam.   Having considered Attorney Barbara C. Johnson's\n\nbrief and presentation during the hearing of June 5, 2009, we are\n\nnot persuaded that the district court abused its discretion by\n\nimposing the discipline of disbarment.   Nor are we persuaded that\n\nany one of the exceptions to reciprocal discipline in this court's\n\nDisciplinary Rule II.C have been established.\n\n     Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\nCause not having been shown why reciprocal discipline substantially\n\nsimilar to that ordered by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court\n\nshould not be imposed here, Attorney Barbara C. Johnson is hereby\n\ndisbarred from the practice of law before this court.\n\n\n\n\n                               - 2 -\n\f",
