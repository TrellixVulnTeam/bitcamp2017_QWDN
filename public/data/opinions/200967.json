Jay A. Garcia-Gregory, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                     Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                  Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Selya, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Joan S. Peters with whom Andrés Guillemard-Noble and Nachman\n& Guillemard were on brief for appellants.\n     José Héctor Vivas with whom Vivas & Vivas was on brief for\nappellee Iván Terón Méndez.\n     Raphael Peña Rámon and De Corral & De Mier for appellee\nAshford Presbyterian Community Hospital.\n\n\n\n                         April 13, 2004\n\f      COFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge.           Appellants Carlos A. García\n\nPérez and Gisela M. Baerga Torres, together with their infant\n\ndaughter Carla Isabel (collectively, the Garcías), challenge the\n\ndistrict court's determination that they were domiciled in Puerto\n\nRico when they filed a medical malpractice claim against appellees\n\nDr. Iván Terón Méndez and Ashford Presbyterian Community Hospital.\n\nThe Garcías contend that they were domiciled in Florida at the time\n\nof the filing, thus establishing complete diversity between the\n\nplaintiffs   and    the   defendants    and   conferring   subject   matter\n\njurisdiction on the district court under 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a)(1).\n\nAfter deliberating upon this well briefed and argued case, we\n\nconclude that errors of both law and fact require recognition of\n\nFlorida as the state of domicile.          We therefore reverse.\n\n                             I.   Background\n\n      The underlying medical malpractice claim arose out of the May\n\n6, 1996, birth of quadruplets to Carlos and Gisela.             At the time,\n\nthe Garcías were living in Gurabo, Puerto Rico.            The babies were\n\npremature and only one child - Carla Isabel - survived.                  She\n\nsuffered from a variety of complications requiring ongoing and\n\nintensive medical care. In June 1996, having already lost three of\n\nthe   quadruplets    while    they     were   in   the   care   of   Ashford\n\nPresbyterian, the Garcías decided to move Carla Isabel to Miami\n\nChildren's Hospital.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f     On May 5, 1997, the medical malpractice claim was filed.\n\nDiscovery on the merits continued until March 23, 2001, when\n\nappellee Terón Méndez filed a motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 12(b)(1), alleging that the Garcías were domiciled in Puerto\n\nRico, and the court therefore lacked subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nAshford Presbyterian joined this motion.\n\n     A   magistrate   judge's   report   and   recommendation,   issued\n\nFebruary 20, 2002, concluded that the Garcías were domiciled in\n\nFlorida at the time the suit was filed and recommended that the\n\nmotion to dismiss be denied.     Reviewing the contested portions of\n\nthe report and recommendation de novo, see 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1),\n\nthe district court reached a contrary determination.        The court\n\nnoted a series of remaining contacts between the Garcías and Puerto\n\nRico, supporting each example with a citation to a particular page\n\nand line number of Carlos's deposition, taken on August 8, 2000.\n\nAt that time, however, the deposition transcript had not been\n\nsubmitted to the court. The only portions of the transcript before\n\nthe court were five pages submitted with appellants' opposition to\n\nthe motion to dismiss, but these did not include several portions\n\nof the deposition cited by appellees. The district court relied on\n\nthe appellees' citations.       In total, the district court listed\n\neleven factors favoring a Puerto Rico domicile, relying not only on\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fthe citations, but also on the phrasing of appellees' objections to\n\nthe magistrate judge's report.1\n\n        Following the court's order of dismissal, appellants moved for\n\nreconsideration.       They pointed out discrepancies between the facts\n\nas described by the district court and the actual deposition\n\ntranscript.        Appellants also argued that the court made a legal\n\nerror in giving significant weight to Carlos's statement that he\n\nwould like to return to Puerto Rico at some undetermined point in\n\nthe future.\n\n        Sensing the precarious nature of the court's reliance on their\n\nparaphrasing, appellees submitted the entire deposition transcript\n\nwith their opposition to the motion for reconsideration. The court\n\naccepted     the    invitation   and    \"carefully   read     the    deposition\n\ntestimony provided.\" It found nothing to change its conclusion and\n\ndenied the motion.       This appeal ensued.\n\n                          II.    Standard of Review\n\n     The determination of domicile presents a mixed question of law\n\nand fact.     Bank One, Texas, N.A. v. Montle, 964 F.2d 48, 51 (1st\n\nCir. 1992).      To the extent that the motion to dismiss called upon\n\nthe district court to resolve factual challenges, we will not set\n\naside    those     findings   unless   clearly   erroneous.         Valentín    v.\n\nHospital Bella Vista, 254 F.3d 358, 365 (1st Cir. 2001).                       \"'A\n\n\n     1\n      We note that seven of the factors rely on the deposition\ntestimony that the court did not have before it at the time of its\ndecision.\n\n                                       -4-\n\ffinding is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to\n\nsupport it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with\n\nthe   definite    and    firm     conviction    that    a   mistake    has    been\n\ncommitted.'\"     Lundquist v. Precision Valley Aviation, Inc., 946\n\nF.2d 8, 11 (1st Cir. 1991)(quoting Anderson v. City of Bessemer\n\nCity, 470 U.S. 564, 573 (1985)(internal citations omitted)).                   We\n\nreview the court's legal conclusions de novo.               Valentín, 254 F.3d\n\nat 365.\n\n                           III.    Law of Domicile\n\n      The   federal     courts    have    jurisdiction      over   controversies\n\narising between \"citizens of different states,\" provided that the\n\namount in controversy exceeds $75,000.              28 U.S.C. § 1332(a)(1).\n\nCitizenship is determined by domicile, Lundquist, 946 F.2d at 10,\n\nwhich can be established by demonstrating that the individual is\n\nphysically present in the state and has an intent to remain\n\nindefinitely, Sun Printing & Publ'g Ass'n v. Edwards, 194 U.S. 377,\n\n383 (1904); Hawes v. Club Ecuestre El Comandante, 598 F.2d 698, 701\n\n(1st Cir. 1979).        Once challenged, the party invoking diversity\n\njurisdiction     must    prove    domicile     by   a   preponderance    of    the\n\nevidence.    Bank One, 964 F.2d at 50.          The key point of inquiry is\n\nwhether diversity of citizenship existed at the time the suit was\n\nfiled; subsequent events may bear on the sincerity of a professed\n\nintention to remain but are not part of the primary calculus.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fHawes, 598 F.2d at 700; Miranda v. Miranda, 686 F. Supp. 44, 47\n\n(D.P.R. 1988).\n\n     Courts typically take into account a variety of factors\n\nindicating the extent of a particular party's ties to the purported\n\ndomicile.   These include:\n\n     current residence; voting registration and voting\n     practices; location of personal and real property;\n     location of brokerage and bank accounts; membership\n     in unions, fraternal organizations, churches, clubs\n     and other associations; place of employment or\n     business; driver's license and other automobile\n     registration; [and] payment of taxes...\n\n13B Wright, Miller & Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure § 3612\n\n(2d ed. 1984).   See also Bank One, 964 F.2d at 50; Hawes, 598 F.2d\n\nat 700.   No single factor is dispositive, and the analysis focuses\n\nnot simply on the number of contacts with the purported domicile,\n\nbut also on their substantive nature.         Lundquist, 946 F.2d at 12\n\n(\"[D]omicile need not be determined by mere numerical comparison of\n\nthe number of factors that may appear to favor each side of the\n\nissue.\"); see also Leon v. Caribbean Hosp. Corp., 848 F. Supp. 317,\n\n318 (D.P.R. 1994) (favoring ties that \"could not be easily undone\"\n\nover more easily established ties).\n\n                             IV.   Analysis\n\n     We turn first to two errors of law affecting the baseline of\n\nthe district court's analysis.\n\n     First, the court erred when it gave considerable weight to\n\nCarlos's testimony - taken more than three years after the case was\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\ffiled - that he thought \"just about every other day\" of returning\n\nto   Puerto    Rico.     In   Hawes,      we   determined    that   a    \"floating\n\nintention\" to return to a former domicile at some unspecified\n\nfuture date does not prevent a party from acquiring a new domicile.\n\n598 F.2d at 701.         Carlos's vague and noncommittal language is\n\nprecisely within the contours of what we consider a floating\n\nintention.       See Valentín,      254    F.3d   at   367   (characterizing      a\n\nfloating intention as \"[a]n amorphous desire to relocate from one\n\nplace to another at an indeterminate future date\" and noting that\n\nsuch an \"'indefinite and ambulatory future intention. . . is of no\n\nreal significance'\")(citing Hardin v. McAvoy, 216 F.2d 399, 403\n\n(5th Cir. 1954)).       As we said in Hawes, an individual is \"entitled\n\nto keep [his] options open,\"        598 F.2d at 704.         Carlos's statement\n\nshould not have been a significant element of the court's analysis.\n\n      Second, the court erred in enunciating the burden of proving\n\ndomicile      once   challenged.2      The     correct   burden     of   proof    is\n\npreponderance of the evidence.             Bank One, 964 F.2d at 50.             The\n\ndistrict court's opinion is at best confusing on this issue.                      In\n\ninitially setting out the burden, the court correctly stated that\n\n\n      2\n      The initial error seems to have been made in appellees'\nmotion to dismiss, which cited Alicea-Rivera v. SIMED, 12 F. Supp.\n2d 243, 245 (D.P.R. 1998), in support of the assertion that the\nplaintiff must prove a change in domicile by clear and convincing\nevidence.    Alicea-Rivera incorrectly adopted the clear and\nconvincing burden of proof from a Second Circuit case analyzing the\nlaw of domicile of New York State.       Id.   Alicea-Rivera is in\nconflict with our earlier decision in Bank One, 964 F.2d at 50, and\ntherefore has no precedential value on the burden of proof issue.\n\n                                       -7-\n\fplaintiffs bore the burden of proving domicile by a preponderance\n\nof the evidence, citing Bank One.           Two paragraphs later, it stated\n\nthe burden as that of proving domicile by clear and convincing\n\nevidence.       It cited Valentín, which, however, says nothing about\n\nthe nature of the burden.       Shortly thereafter, the court repeated\n\nthe clear and convincing evidence standard, erroneously citing Bank\n\nOne.       Finally, the court concluded that plaintiffs \"have failed to\n\nrebut this evidence [of Puerto Rico domicile] with clear and\n\nconvincing proof,\" immediately following this language with an\n\ninvocation      of   \"preponderance   of    evidence,\"   citing   Francis   v.\n\nGoodman, 81 F.3d 5, 6 (1st Cir. 1996).            Appellants did not raise\n\nthe issue below,3 but it is settled in this circuit that an\n\nappellate court has discretion, in exceptional cases, to relieve a\n\nparty of forfeiture.        See United States v. La Guardia, 902 F.2d\n\n1010, 1013 (1st Cir. 1990).       This is such a case.      Not only should\n\nthe proper burden govern our review, but both courts and lawyers\n\nshould be aware of the importance of clarity as to the applicable\n\nburden of proof.         To the extent that the court evaluated the\n\nappellants' evidence under a clear and convincing standard, plain\n\nerror occurred.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      Upon questioning at oral argument, both parties agreed that\nthe burden was preponderance of the evidence. This was a retreat\nfrom appellees' earlier argument in their briefs before this court,\nwhich, like the motion to dismiss, incorrectly stated the burden.\n\n                                      -8-\n\f     We now move on to our factual analysis.            The district court\n\nmarshaled a string of factors favoring domicile in Puerto Rico,\n\nwhich we now review as context for our analysis of factual error.\n\n     In concluding that Carlos \"lacked the intent to change his\n\ndomicile to Florida,\" the district court focused on the couple's\n\nremaining contacts in Puerto Rico, which include the fact that at\n\nthe time the suit was filed, Carlos was employed by Goldman\n\nAntonetti (a law firm based in Puerto Rico) and traveled to Puerto\n\nRico for business, that the Garcías rented (rather than sold) their\n\nGurabo house, and that the family left open two Puerto Rico bank\n\naccounts and made regular use of an ATM card associated with one of\n\nthose accounts.    The district court also made much of the family's\n\ninterest in a Taco Maker franchise, from which they derived about\n\n16% of their annual reported income for 1997. Carlos was president\n\nof the franchise corporation and Gisela held a contract that paid\n\nher approximately fourteen hundred to fifteen hundred dollars a\n\nmonth in exchange for services and advice regarding the operation\n\nof the Taco Maker.     The district court also pointed to the couple's\n\nfiling   of   income   tax   returns   in    Puerto   Rico    (reporting   the\n\nfranchise income).\n\n     As we noted earlier, the district court adopted the appellees'\n\nversion of the facts, including citations to portions of Carlos's\n\ndeposition    transcript     that   were    not   submitted   to   the   court.\n\nAppellants argue that the district court failed to conduct an\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\findependent review of the record, misconstrued Carlos's testimony\n\nand relied on irrelevant factors, entirely disregarding their\n\ncontrary evidence.       We now consider these contentions.\n\n     A review of the record, including the deposition transcript,\n\nreveals   that   Carlos    and   Gisela    created   substantial    personal,\n\nprofessional     and    civic    ties     to   Florida   that   significantly\n\noutweighed their residual ties with Puerto Rico.\n\n      First, Carlos and Gisela established that Florida was their\n\npersonal and financial base.        By the time the lawsuit was filed,\n\nthey had each registered to vote in Florida, acquired Florida\n\ndrivers' licenses, sold their car in Puerto Rico, and purchased two\n\ncars in Florida.       In addition, the Garcías rented out their Puerto\n\nRico house, unfurnished, on an annual basis.4            They opened a Miami\n\nbank account, which became the primary account for the family's\n\nexpenses.   The couple did retain a Puerto Rican bank account, but\n\nthe district court's reference to \"regular\" use of the Puerto Rican\n\nATM card is unsupported by the record.            No plausible construction\n\nof the cited testimony supports calling the use \"regular,\"5 and no\n\n\n     4\n      In the five years that they lived in Miami, Carlos and Gisela\npurchased two homes in Florida and had two more children. In March\n1999, Carlos resigned from Goldman Antonetti and joined the Miami\noffice of Rice Fowler, a law firm based in New Orleans. Although\nthese events, occurring subsequent to the filing of the lawsuit,\nare not the primary focus of our analysis, we note them as\nindicative of the sincerity of the family's intent to remain in\nFlorida, see supra at 5-6.\n     5\n       The full text of the exchange is as follows:\nQ:   Do you have any credit cards issued by banks in Puerto Rico?\n\n                                        -10-\n\freasonable inference from that portion of the testimony supports a\n\nPuerto Rico domicile.         This was a clearly erroneous conclusion.\n\n      In evaluating the family's financial contacts, the district\n\ncourt further erred in concluding that the Garcías' Puerto Rico tax\n\nreturns implied a Puerto Rico domicile.                Gisela and Carlos used\n\ntheir Miami address on their return.            The act of filing the return\n\nis not by itself evidence of domicile.                As appellants note, any\n\nindividual deriving income from Puerto Rico is required to file a\n\ntax return, regardless of citizenship. Furthermore, the tax return\n\nprovides no evidence that Puerto Rico was the appellants' financial\n\nbase;     the     reported     income    derived      from    Puerto     Rico   was\n\napproximately 16% of the family's annual income.\n\n        Second,    the    court's   conclusion        that    Carlos's    residual\n\nprofessional       ties   supported     a    Puerto    Rico    domicile    is   not\n\nsubstantiated by the evidence.              By May 1997, Carlos had built a\n\nprofessional foundation for himself in Miami, including studying\n\nfor and passing the Florida bar exam, working out of an office in\n\nhis home, and spearheading the opening of a branch office for\n\nGoldman Antonetti.           He had, by February, not only explored job\n\n\n\nA:   Any what; I am sorry?\nQ:   Credit cards?\nA:   No. I still have the ATH.\nQ:   Okay, the ATM from Banco Popular?\nA:   Yes.\nQ:   Do you use it in Florida?\nA:   No.\nQ:   Okay.\n\n                                        -11-\n\fopportunities in Miami but had begun discussions with the head of\n\nhis firm's litigation department regarding the branch office.\n\nAlthough formal approval was not given until shortly after the\n\ncomplaint was filed, it is clear that Carlos had by that time the\n\nsettled       intent     to   practice    law      in   Florida,   with   reasonable\n\nexpectation of an association in Florida with his firm.6                        Carlos\n\ntestified that he traveled to Puerto Rico for business, in service\n\nto some Puerto Rico clients, on only an \"on and off basis.\"\n\n       Third, the evidence demonstrates that the Garcías' role in the\n\nTaco Maker corporation involved minimal contacts with Puerto Rico\n\nthat       were   more   indicative      of   an    investment     interest    than   a\n\nsubstantial tie.          Carlos testified that Gisela never traveled to\n\nPuerto Rico to render services to the Taco Maker.                    Neither Carlos\n\nnor Gisela was involved in day-to-day operations; Carlos's related\n\ntravel was in his capacity as president of the corporation, an\n\noffice which neither requires nor suggests that he was domiciled in\n\nPuerto Rico.        The district court seemed to think it notable that\n\nCarlos filed the corporation's Puerto Rico income tax returns, but\n\nthis simply demonstrates that he fulfilled what were reasonably his\n\nduties as an officer of a closely-held corporation.                           There is\n\n\n\n\n       6\n      Neither party has provided us with the exact date that the\nfirm formally approved the opening of the Miami office, agreeing\nonly that it was about one month after Carlos passed the Florida\nbar exam in mid-April.\n\n                                          -12-\n\flittle support for a Puerto Rico domicile by virtue of these\n\ncorporate contacts.\n\n     Of course, not all factors weigh heavily in favor of a Florida\n\ndomicile.     But our review indicates to us that, although on the\n\nsurface there are ties to Puerto Rico, in every area those ties\n\nappear more     tenuous    as     the   evidence    is      more    fully    revealed.\n\nFinancial    ties   were    sharply      confined      to    a     limited       purpose.\n\nBusiness     relations     were    similarly       restricted        to     infrequent\n\noversight.    Meanwhile, the ordinary arrangements for settling into\n\na community were becoming stronger in Florida, by registering to\n\nvote, purchasing cars, and contracting to rent an apartment.                          But\n\nmost important was the evidence of an intent to remain in Florida\n\nand earn a livelihood there:            studying for the bar, exploring job\n\nopportunities, planning and receiving encouragement for opening a\n\nbranch office for his firm.\n\n     We see the scales in this case as weighted, on the Puerto Rico\n\nside, by formal and attenuated connections, while, on the Florida\n\nside, by deliberate investment of time and energy in preparing for\n\nliving and working indefinitely in Florida.\n\n     Appellees offer no arguments that undermine this conclusion.\n\nTheir attempt to characterize the relocation as \"forced,\" and\n\ntherefore unable to effect a change in domicile, is contrary to\n\nprecedent.      Although    the     Garcías    moved     because      of     a    medical\n\nemergency, motive does not defeat a bona fide change in domicile.\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\fSee Hawes, 598 F.2d at 702 (plaintiffs were not prevented from\n\nacquiring new domicile simply because relocation was motivated by\n\nurgent need to seek medical care).          Furthermore, rather than take\n\nsteps to move back to Puerto Rico following the baby's release from\n\nthe hospital in October 1996, the Garcías strengthened their ties\n\nwith Florida, including Carlos's commitment a month later to take\n\nthe Florida bar exam.        See Hawes, 598 F.2d at 703-04 (noting that\n\nif Hawes had intended to return to Puerto Rico, \"the time to do so\n\nwas when her husband left for Mexico [after being discharged from\n\na rehabilitation center]\").\n\n       As far as we can see, the cases relied on by appellees\n\nactually support the Garcías' claim.              Alicea-Rivera involved a\n\nstudent   who    lived   with   relatives   and   did   not   pay   for    rent,\n\nutilities or phone; he retained his Puerto Rico driver's license\n\nand held only a part-time job that didn't indicate steps toward a\n\npermanent residence.         See Alicea-Rivera, 12 F. Supp. 2d at 246.\n\nThis    case    is   quite   inapposite,    relating    primarily     to    the\n\nestablished principle that out-of-state college students are not\n\ndomiciliaries of the state in which they go to school.              Id.\n\n       Likewise, we are somewhat perplexed by appellees' reliance on\n\nLeon, in which the court found that \"superficial\" ties such as bank\n\naccounts, voter registration and drivers' licenses did not - on\n\ntheir own - indicate a change of domicile.           Leon, 848 F. Supp. at\n\n318. However, studying for and taking the Florida bar exam is just\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\fthe sort of \"complicated\" and skilled undertaking that the Leon\n\ncourt would have found more convincing evidence of a change of\n\ndomicile.    Id.   Furthermore, the Leon court observed that:\n\n            [It] is more significant to examine, however,\n            the bridges back to Puerto Rico that she\n            failed to burn.   She resigned from her job,\n            but her employer expected her to return . . .\n            . It was her Puerto Rican checking account\n            that was routinely as reflected by the\n            activity in the check register used. Although\n            she rented out a small apartment . . . , she\n            left her home, with all of the furniture,\n            unoccupied. She did not even discontinue her\n            utility services . . . [H]er late model car\n            was left in Puerto Rico, where it was ready\n            and waiting for her upon her return . . . .\n            Her main source of income, social security\n            payments, continued to be sent to her Puerto\n            Rico address.    Likewise, she did not file\n            federal, state or city tax return[s] using her\n            Illinois address, in addition to the filing of\n            her Puerto Rico income return.\n\nId.   In the instant case, not one of these \"bridges\" remained.\n\n      And   finally,   Valentín,   254    F.3d   at   361,   which   at   least\n\npresents comparable facts in that the plaintiff relocated in order\n\nto seek medical treatment, nevertheless involved a situation in\n\nwhich the plaintiff maintained much stronger connections with\n\nPuerto Rico and failed to establish any of comparable significance\n\nin Florida.     Valentín lived with her sister during her stay in\n\nFlorida, and kept the bulk of her personal belongings (including a\n\ncar) in Puerto Rico.     Id. at 361-62, 366.      Significantly, Valentín\n\ndid not resign from her position as a nurse in Puerto Rico and she\n\nnever worked in Florida.     She relied on a combination of sick days\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\fand unpaid leave to cover her stay.            Carlos, on the other hand,\n\nactually worked in Miami - either from home or at a branch office.\n\n      Correcting for the factual and legal errors, the remaining\n\nevidence predominantly establishes that Florida was the Garcías'\n\n\"true, fixed home and principal establishment,\" to which, whenever\n\nthey were absent, they had the intention of returning. 13B Wright,\n\nMiller &   Cooper,     Federal   Practice    and   Procedure,     at   §   3612.\n\nSee also Valentín, 254 F.3d at 366.         The ties remaining with Puerto\n\nRico - ongoing investments and the retention of property in order\n\nto   benefit   from   supplemental    rental   income   -   are   simply    the\n\nvestiges of longtime prior residence on the island . . . and a\n\nnostalgic hope for a far off future.\n\n      In sum, an evaluation of the relevant factors under the proper\n\nburden of proof leads us to the conclusion that the appellants were\n\ndomiciled in Florida.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\f",

Garc&#237;a P&#233;rez and Gisela M. Baerga Torres, together with their infant daughter Carla Isabel (collectively, the Garc&#237;as), challenge the district court's determination that they were domiciled in Puerto Rico when they filed a medical malpractice claim against appellees Dr. Iv&#225;n Ter&#243;n M&#233;ndez and Ashford Presbyterian Community Hospital. The Garc&#237;as contend that they were domiciled in Florida at the time of the filing, thus establishing complete diversity between the plaintiffs and the defendants and conferring subject matter jurisdiction on the district court under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a)(1). After deliberating upon this well briefed and argued case, we conclude that errors of both law and fact require recognition of Florida as the state of domicile. We therefore reverse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The underlying medical malpractice claim arose out of the May 6, 1996, birth of quadruplets to Carlos and Gisela. At the time, the Garc&#237;as were living in Gurabo, Puerto Rico. The babies were premature and only one child &#8212; Carla Isabel &#8212; survived. She suffered from a variety of complications requiring ongoing and intensive medical care. In June 1996, having already lost three of the quadruplets while they were in the care of Ashford Presbyterian, the Garc&#237;as decided to move Carla Isabel to Miami Children's Hospital.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 5, 1997, the medical malpractice claim was filed. Discovery on the merits continued until March 23, 2001, when appellee Ter&#243;n M&#233;ndez filed a motion to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1), alleging that the Garc&#237;as were domiciled in Puerto Rico, and the court therefore lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Ashford Presbyterian joined this motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A magistrate judge's report and recommendation, issued February 20, 2002, concluded that the Garc&#237;as were domiciled in Florida at the time the suit was filed and recommended that the motion to dismiss be denied. Reviewing the contested portions of the report and recommendation de novo, <i>see</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 636(b)(1), the district court reached a contrary determination. The court noted a series of remaining contacts between the Garc&#237;as and Puerto Rico, supporting each example with a citation to a particular page and line number of Carlos's deposition, taken on August 8, 2000. At that time, however, the deposition transcript had not been submitted to the court. The only portions of the transcript before the court were five pages submitted with appellants' opposition to the motion to dismiss, but these did not include several portions of the deposition cited by appellees. The district court relied on the appellees' citations. In total, the district court listed eleven factors favoring a Puerto Rico domicile, relying not only on the citations, but also on the phrasing of appellees' objections to the magistrate judge's report.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the court's order of dismissal, appellants moved for reconsideration. They pointed out discrepancies between the facts as described by the district court and the actual deposition transcript. Appellants also argued that the court made a legal error in giving significant weight to Carlos's statement that he would like to return to Puerto Rico at some undetermined point in the future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sensing the precarious nature of the court's reliance on their paraphrasing, appellees submitted the entire deposition transcript with their opposition to the motion for reconsideration. The court accepted the invitation and \"carefully read the deposition testimony provided.\" It found nothing to change its conclusion and denied the motion. This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Standard of Review</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The determination of domicile presents a mixed question of law and fact. <i>Bank One, Texas, N.A. v. Montle,</i> 964 F.2d 48, 51 (1st Cir.1992). To the extent that the motion to dismiss called upon the district court to resolve factual challenges, we will not set aside those findings unless clearly erroneous. <i>Valent&#237;n v. Hospital Bella Vista,</i> 254 F.3d 358, 365 (1st Cir.2001). \"`A finding is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.'\" <i>Lundquist v. Precision Valley Aviation, Inc.,</i> 946 F.2d 8, 11 (1st Cir.1991)(quoting <i>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City,</i> 470 U.S. 564, 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985)(internal citations omitted)). We review the court's legal conclusions de novo. <i>Valent&#237;n,</i> 254 F.3d at 365.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Law of Domicile</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The federal courts have jurisdiction over controversies arising between \"citizens of different states,\" provided that the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a)(1). Citizenship is determined by domicile, <i>Lundquist,</i> 946 F.2d at 10, which can be established by demonstrating that the individual is physically present in the state and has an intent to remain indefinitely, <i>Sun Printing &amp; Publ'g Ass'n v. Edwards,</i> 194 U.S. 377, 383, 24 S.Ct. 696, 48 L.Ed. 1027 (1904); <i>Hawes v. Club Ecuestre El Comandante,</i> 598 F.2d 698, 701 (1st Cir.1979). Once challenged, the party invoking diversity jurisdiction must prove domicile by a preponderance of the evidence. <i>Bank One,</i> 964 F.2d at 50. The key point of inquiry is whether diversity of citizenship existed at the time the suit was filed; subsequent events may bear on the sincerity of a professed intention to remain but are not part of the primary calculus. <i>Hawes,</i> 598 F.2d at 700; <i>Miranda v. Miranda,</i> 686 F.Supp. 44, 47 (D.P.R.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts typically take into account a variety of factors indicating the extent of a particular party's ties to the purported domicile. These include:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">current residence; voting registration and voting practices; location of personal and real property; location of brokerage and bank accounts; membership in unions, fraternal organizations, churches, clubs and other associations; place of employment or business; driver's license and other automobile registration; [and] payment of taxes ...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">13B Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> &#167; 3612 (2d ed.1984). <i>See also Bank One,</i> 964 F.2d at 50; <i>Hawes,</i> 598 F.2d at 700. No single factor is dispositive, and the analysis focuses not simply on the number of contacts with the purported domicile, but also on their substantive nature. <i>Lundquist,</i> 946 F.2d at 12 (\"[D]omicile need not be determined by mere numerical comparison of the number of factors that may appear to favor each side of the issue.\"); <i>see also Leon v. Caribbean Hosp. Corp.,</i> 848 F.Supp. 317, 318 (D.P.R.1994) (favoring ties that \"could not be easily undone\" over more easily established ties).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">IV. <i>Analysis</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn first to two errors of law affecting the baseline of the district court's analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the court erred when it gave considerable weight to Carlos's testimony &#8212; taken more than three years after the case was filed &#8212; that he thought \"just about every other day\" of returning to Puerto Rico. In <i>Hawes,</i> we determined that a \"floating intention\" to return to a former domicile at some unspecified future date does not prevent a party from acquiring a new domicile. 598 F.2d at 701. Carlos's vague and noncommittal language is precisely within the contours of what we consider a floating intention. <i>See Valent&#237;n,</i> 254 F.3d at 367 (characterizing a floating intention as \"[a]n amorphous desire to relocate from one place to another at an indeterminate future date\" and noting that such an \"`indefinite and ambulatory future intention ... is of no real significance'\")(citing <i>Hardin v. McAvoy,</i> 216 F.2d 399, 403 (5th Cir.1954)). As we said in <i>Hawes,</i> an individual is \"entitled to keep [his] options open,\" 598 F.2d at 704. Carlos's statement should not have been a significant element of the court's analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the court erred in enunciating the burden of proving domicile once challenged.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The correct burden of proof is preponderance of the evidence. <i>Bank One,</i> 964 F.2d at 50. The district court's opinion is at best confusing on this issue. In initially setting out the burden, the court correctly stated that plaintiffs bore the burden of proving domicile by a preponderance of the evidence, citing <i>Bank One.</i> Two paragraphs later, it stated the burden as that of proving domicile by clear and convincing evidence. It cited <i>Valent&#237;n,</i> which, however, says nothing about the nature of the burden. Shortly thereafter, the court repeated the clear and convincing evidence standard, erroneously citing <i>Bank One.</i> Finally, the court concluded that plaintiffs \"have failed to rebut this evidence [of Puerto Rico domicile] with clear and convincing proof,\" immediately following this language with an invocation of \"preponderance of evidence,\" citing <i>Francis v. Goodman,</i> 81 F.3d 5, 6 (1st Cir.1996). Appellants did not raise the issue below,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> but it is settled in this circuit that an appellate court has discretion, in exceptional cases, to relieve a party of forfeiture. <i>See United States v. La Guardia,</i> 902 F.2d 1010, 1013 (1st Cir.1990). This is such a case. Not only should the proper burden govern our review, but both courts and lawyers should be aware of the importance of clarity as to the applicable burden of proof. To the extent that the court evaluated the appellants' evidence under a clear and convincing standard, plain error occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now move on to our factual analysis. The district court marshaled a string of factors favoring domicile in Puerto Rico, which we now review as context for our analysis of factual error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In concluding that Carlos \"lacked the intent to change his domicile to Florida,\" the district court focused on the couple's remaining contacts in Puerto Rico, which include the fact that at the time the suit was filed, Carlos was employed by Goldman Antonetti (a law firm based in Puerto Rico) and traveled to Puerto Rico for business, that the Garc&#237;as rented (rather than sold) their Gurabo house, and that the family left open two Puerto Rico bank accounts and made regular use of an ATM card associated with one of those accounts. The district court also made much of the family's interest in a Taco Maker franchise, from which they derived about 16% of their annual reported income for 1997. Carlos was president of the franchise corporation and Gisela held a contract that paid her approximately fourteen hundred to fifteen hundred dollars a month in exchange for services and advice regarding the operation of the Taco Maker. The district court also pointed to the couple's filing of income tax returns in Puerto Rico (reporting the franchise income).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we noted earlier, the district court adopted the appellees' version of the facts, including citations to portions of Carlos's deposition transcript that were not submitted to the court. Appellants argue that the district court failed to conduct an independent review of the record, misconstrued Carlos's testimony and relied on irrelevant factors, entirely disregarding their contrary evidence. We now consider these contentions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A review of the record, including the deposition transcript, reveals that Carlos and Gisela created substantial personal, professional and civic ties to Florida that significantly outweighed their residual ties with Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Carlos and Gisela established that Florida was their personal and financial base. By the time the lawsuit was filed, they had each registered to vote in Florida, acquired Florida drivers' licenses, sold their car in Puerto Rico, and purchased two cars in Florida. In addition, the Garc&#237;as rented out their Puerto Rico house, unfurnished, on an annual basis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> They opened a Miami bank account, which became the primary account for the family's expenses. The couple did retain a Puerto Rican bank account, but the district court's reference to \"regular\" use of the Puerto Rican ATM card is unsupported by the record. No plausible construction of the cited testimony supports calling the use \"regular,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and no reasonable inference from that portion of the testimony supports a Puerto Rico domicile. This was a clearly erroneous conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In evaluating the family's financial contacts, the district court further erred in concluding that the Garc&#237;as' Puerto Rico tax returns implied a Puerto Rico domicile. Gisela and Carlos used their Miami address on their return. The act of filing the return is not by itself evidence of domicile. As appellants note, any individual deriving income from Puerto Rico is required to file a tax return, regardless of citizenship. Furthermore, the tax return provides no evidence that Puerto Rico was the appellants' financial base; the reported income derived from Puerto Rico was approximately 16% of the family's annual income.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the court's conclusion that Carlos's residual professional ties supported a Puerto Rico domicile is not substantiated by the evidence. By May 1997, Carlos had built a professional foundation for himself in Miami, including studying for and passing the Florida bar exam, working out of an office in his home, and spearheading the opening of a branch office for Goldman Antonetti. He had, by February, not only explored job opportunities in Miami but had begun discussions with the head of his firm's litigation department regarding the branch office. Although formal approval was not given until shortly after the complaint was filed, it is clear that Carlos had by that time the settled intent to practice law in Florida, with reasonable expectation of an association in Florida with his firm.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Carlos testified that he traveled to Puerto Rico for business, in service to some Puerto Rico clients, on only an \"on and off basis.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the evidence demonstrates that the Garc&#237;as' role in the Taco Maker corporation involved minimal contacts with Puerto Rico that were more indicative of an investment interest than a substantial tie. Carlos testified that Gisela never traveled to Puerto Rico to render services to the Taco Maker. Neither Carlos nor Gisela was involved in day-to-day operations; Carlos's related travel was in his capacity as president of the corporation, an office which neither requires nor suggests that he was domiciled in Puerto Rico. The district court seemed to think it notable that Carlos filed the corporation's Puerto Rico income tax returns, but this simply demonstrates that he fulfilled what were reasonably his duties as an officer of a closely-held corporation. There is little support for a Puerto Rico domicile by virtue of these corporate contacts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, not all factors weigh heavily in favor of a Florida domicile. But our review indicates to us that, although on the surface there are ties to Puerto Rico, in every area those ties appear more tenuous as the evidence is more fully revealed. Financial ties were sharply confined to a limited purpose. Business relations were similarly restricted to infrequent oversight. Meanwhile, the ordinary arrangements for settling into a community were becoming stronger in Florida, by registering to vote, purchasing cars, and contracting to rent an apartment. But most important was the evidence of an intent to remain in Florida and earn a livelihood there: studying for the bar, exploring job opportunities, planning and receiving encouragement for opening a branch office for his firm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We see the scales in this case as weighted, on the Puerto Rico side, by formal and attenuated connections, while, on the Florida side, by deliberate investment of time and energy in preparing for living and working indefinitely in Florida.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellees offer no arguments that undermine this conclusion. Their attempt to characterize the relocation as \"forced,\" and therefore unable to effect a change in domicile, is contrary to precedent. Although the Garc&#237;as moved because of a medical emergency, motive does not defeat a bona fide change in domicile. <i>See Hawes,</i> 598 F.2d at 702 (plaintiffs were not prevented from acquiring new domicile simply because relocation was motivated by urgent need to seek medical care). Furthermore, rather than take steps to move back to Puerto Rico following the baby's release from the hospital in October 1996, the Garc&#237;as strengthened their ties with Florida, including Carlos's commitment a month later to take the Florida bar exam. <i>See Hawes,</i> 598 F.2d at 703-04 (noting that if Hawes had intended to return to Puerto Rico, \"the time to do so was when her husband left for Mexico [after being discharged from a rehabilitation center]\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As far as we can see, the cases relied on by appellees actually support the Garc&#237;as' claim. <i>Alicea-Rivera</i> involved a student who lived with relatives and did not pay for rent, utilities or phone; he retained his Puerto Rico driver's license and held only a part-time job that didn't indicate steps toward a permanent residence. <i>See Alicea-Rivera,</i> 12 F.Supp.2d at 246.

However, studying for and taking the Florida bar exam is just the sort of \"complicated\" and skilled undertaking that the <i>Leon</i> court would have found more convincing evidence of a change of domicile. <i>Id.</i> Furthermore, the <i>Leon</i> court observed that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[It] is more significant to examine, however, the bridges back to Puerto Rico that she failed to burn.

Garc&#237;a P&#233;rez and Gisela M. Baerga Torres, together with their infant daughter Carla Isabel (collectively, the Garc&#237;as), challenge the district court's determination that they were domiciled in Puerto Rico when they filed a medical malpractice claim against appellees Dr. Iv&#225;n Ter&#243;n M&#233;ndez and Ashford Presbyterian Community Hospital. The Garc&#237;as contend that they were domiciled in Florida at the time of the filing, thus establishing complete diversity between the plaintiffs and the defendants and conferring subject matter jurisdiction on the district court under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a)(1). After deliberating upon this well briefed and argued case, we conclude that errors of both law and fact require recognition of Florida as the state of domicile. We therefore reverse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The underlying medical malpractice claim arose out of the May 6, 1996, birth of quadruplets to Carlos and Gisela. At the time, the Garc&#237;as were living in Gurabo, Puerto Rico. The babies were premature and only one child &#8212; Carla Isabel &#8212; survived. She suffered from a variety of complications requiring ongoing and intensive medical care. In June 1996, having already lost three of the quadruplets while they were in the care of Ashford Presbyterian, the Garc&#237;as decided to move Carla Isabel to Miami Children's Hospital.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 5, 1997, the medical malpractice claim was filed. Discovery on the merits continued until March 23, 2001, when appellee Ter&#243;n M&#233;ndez filed a motion to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1), alleging that the Garc&#237;as were domiciled in Puerto Rico, and the court therefore lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Ashford Presbyterian joined this motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A magistrate judge's report and recommendation, issued February 20, 2002, concluded that the Garc&#237;as were domiciled in Florida at the time the suit was filed and recommended that the motion to dismiss be denied. Reviewing the contested portions of the report and recommendation de novo, <i>see</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 636(b)(1), the district court reached a contrary determination. The court noted a series of remaining contacts between the Garc&#237;as and Puerto Rico, supporting each example with a citation to a particular page and line number of Carlos's deposition, taken on August 8, 2000. At that time, however, the deposition transcript had not been submitted to the court. The only portions of the transcript before the court were five pages submitted with appellants' opposition to the motion to dismiss, but these did not include several portions of the deposition cited by appellees. The district court relied on the appellees' citations. In total, the district court listed eleven factors favoring a Puerto Rico domicile, relying not only on the citations, but also on the phrasing of appellees' objections to the magistrate judge's report.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the court's order of dismissal, appellants moved for reconsideration. They pointed out discrepancies between the facts as described by the district court and the actual deposition transcript. Appellants also argued that the court made a legal error in giving significant weight to Carlos's statement that he would like to return to Puerto Rico at some undetermined point in the future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sensing the precarious nature of the court's reliance on their paraphrasing, appellees submitted the entire deposition transcript with their opposition to the motion for reconsideration. The court accepted the invitation and \"carefully read the deposition testimony provided.\" It found nothing to change its conclusion and denied the motion. This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Standard of Review</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The determination of domicile presents a mixed question of law and fact. <i>Bank One, Texas, N.A. v.

In <i>Hawes,</i> we determined that a \"floating intention\" to return to a former domicile at some unspecified future date does not prevent a party from acquiring a new domicile. 598 F.2d at 701. Carlos's vague and noncommittal language is precisely within the contours of what we consider a floating intention. <i>See Valent&#237;n,</i> 254 F.3d at 367 (characterizing a floating intention as \"[a]n amorphous desire to relocate from one place to another at an indeterminate future date\" and noting that such an \"`indefinite and ambulatory future intention ... is of no real significance'\")(citing <i>Hardin v.

As we said in <i>Hawes,</i> an individual is \"entitled to keep [his] options open,\" 598 F.2d at 704. Carlos's statement should not have been a significant element of the court's analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the court erred in enunciating the burden of proving domicile once challenged.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The correct burden of proof is preponderance of the evidence. <i>Bank One,</i> 964 F.2d at 50. The district court's opinion is at best confusing on this issue. In initially setting out the burden, the court correctly stated that plaintiffs bore the burden of proving domicile by a preponderance of the evidence, citing <i>Bank One.</i> Two paragraphs later, it stated the burden as that of proving domicile by clear and convincing evidence. It cited <i>Valent&#237;n,</i> which, however, says nothing about the nature of the burden. Shortly thereafter, the court repeated the clear and convincing evidence standard, erroneously citing <i>Bank One.</i> Finally, the court concluded that plaintiffs \"have failed to rebut this evidence [of Puerto Rico domicile] with clear and convincing proof,\" immediately following this language with an invocation of \"preponderance of evidence,\" citing <i>Francis v. Goodman,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></span>, 6 (1st Cir.1996). Appellants did not raise the issue below,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> but it is settled in this circuit that an appellate court has discretion, in exceptional cases, to relieve a party of forfeiture. <i>See United States v. La Guardia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"541060\"><a href=\"/opinion/541060/united-states-v-julio-la-guardia-united-states-of-america-v-eredia/\"><span class=\"volume\">902</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1010</span></a></span>, 1013 (1st Cir.1990). This is such a case. Not only should the proper burden govern our review, but both courts and lawyers should be aware of the importance of clarity as to the applicable burden of proof. To the extent that the court evaluated the appellants' evidence under a clear and convincing standard, plain error occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now move on to our factual analysis. The district court marshaled a string of factors favoring domicile in Puerto Rico, which we now review as context for our analysis of factual error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In concluding that Carlos \"lacked the intent to change his domicile to Florida,\" the district court focused on the couple's remaining contacts in Puerto Rico, which include the fact that at the time the suit was filed, Carlos was employed by Goldman Antonetti (a law firm based in Puerto Rico) and traveled to Puerto Rico for business, that the Garc&#237;as rented (rather than sold) their Gurabo house, and that the family left open two Puerto Rico bank accounts and made regular use of an ATM card associated with one of those accounts. The district court also made much of the family's interest in a Taco Maker franchise, from which they derived about 16% of their annual reported income for 1997. Carlos was president of the franchise corporation and Gisela held a contract that paid her approximately fourteen hundred to fifteen hundred dollars a month in exchange for services and advice regarding the operation of the Taco Maker. The district court also pointed to the couple's filing of income tax returns in Puerto Rico (reporting the franchise income).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we noted earlier, the district court adopted the appellees' version of the facts, including citations to portions of Carlos's deposition transcript that were not submitted to the court. Appellants argue that the district court failed to conduct an independent review of the record, misconstrued Carlos's testimony and relied on irrelevant factors, entirely disregarding their contrary evidence. We now consider these contentions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A review of the record, including the deposition transcript, reveals that Carlos and Gisela created substantial personal, professional and civic ties to Florida that significantly outweighed their residual ties with Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Carlos and Gisela established that Florida was their personal and financial base. By the time the lawsuit was filed, they had each registered to vote in Florida, acquired Florida drivers' licenses, sold their car in Puerto Rico, and purchased two cars in Florida. In addition, the Garc&#237;as rented out their Puerto Rico house, unfurnished, on an annual basis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> They opened a Miami bank account, which became the primary account for the family's expenses. The couple did retain a Puerto Rican bank account, but the district court's reference to \"regular\" use of the Puerto Rican ATM card is unsupported by the record. No plausible construction of the cited testimony supports calling the use \"regular,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and no reasonable inference from that portion of the testimony supports a Puerto Rico domicile. This was a clearly erroneous conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In evaluating the family's financial contacts, the district court further erred in concluding that the Garc&#237;as' Puerto Rico tax returns implied a Puerto Rico domicile. Gisela and Carlos used their Miami address on their return. The act of filing the return is not by itself evidence of domicile. As appellants note, any individual deriving income from Puerto Rico is required to file a tax return, regardless of citizenship. Furthermore, the tax return provides no evidence that Puerto Rico was the appellants' financial base; the reported income derived from Puerto Rico was approximately 16% of the family's annual income.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the court's conclusion that Carlos's residual professional ties supported a Puerto Rico domicile is not substantiated by the evidence. By May 1997, Carlos had built a professional foundation for himself in Miami, including studying for and passing the Florida bar exam, working out of an office in his home, and spearheading the opening of a branch office for Goldman Antonetti. He had, by February, not only explored job opportunities in Miami but had begun discussions with the head of his firm's litigation department regarding the branch office. Although formal approval was not given until shortly after the complaint was filed, it is clear that Carlos had by that time the settled intent to practice law in Florida, with reasonable expectation of an association in Florida with his firm.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Carlos testified that he traveled to Puerto Rico for business, in service to some Puerto Rico clients, on only an \"on and off basis.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the evidence demonstrates that the Garc&#237;as' role in the Taco Maker corporation involved minimal contacts with Puerto Rico that were more indicative of an investment interest than a substantial tie. Carlos testified that Gisela never traveled to Puerto Rico to render services to the Taco Maker. Neither Carlos nor Gisela was involved in day-to-day operations; Carlos's related travel was in his capacity as president of the corporation, an office which neither requires nor suggests that he was domiciled in Puerto Rico. The district court seemed to think it notable that Carlos filed the corporation's Puerto Rico income tax returns, but this simply demonstrates that he fulfilled what were reasonably his duties as an officer of a closely-held corporation. There is little support for a Puerto Rico domicile by virtue of these corporate contacts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, not all factors weigh heavily in favor of a Florida domicile. But our review indicates to us that, although on the surface there are ties to Puerto Rico, in every area those ties appear more tenuous as the evidence is more fully revealed. Financial ties were sharply confined to a limited purpose. Business relations were similarly restricted to infrequent oversight. Meanwhile, the ordinary arrangements for settling into a community were becoming stronger in Florida, by registering to vote, purchasing cars, and contracting to rent an apartment. But most important was the evidence of an intent to remain in Florida and earn a livelihood there: studying for the bar, exploring job opportunities, planning and receiving encouragement for opening a branch office for his firm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We see the scales in this case as weighted, on the Puerto Rico side, by formal and attenuated connections, while, on the Florida side, by deliberate investment of time and energy in preparing for living and working indefinitely in Florida.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellees offer no arguments that undermine this conclusion. Their attempt to characterize the relocation as \"forced,\" and therefore unable to effect a change in domicile, is contrary to precedent. Although the Garc&#237;as moved because of a medical emergency, motive does not defeat a bona fide change in domicile. <i>See Hawes,</i> 598 F.2d at 702 (plaintiffs were not prevented from acquiring new domicile simply because relocation was motivated by urgent need to seek medical care). Furthermore, rather than take steps to move back to Puerto Rico following the baby's release from the hospital in October 1996, the Garc&#237;as strengthened their ties with Florida, including Carlos's commitment a month later to take the Florida bar exam. <i>See Hawes,</i> 598 F.2d at 703-04 (noting that if Hawes had intended to return to Puerto Rico, \"the time to do so was when her husband left for Mexico [after being discharged from a rehabilitation center]\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As far as we can see, the cases relied on by appellees actually support the Garc&#237;as' claim. <i>Alicea-Rivera</i> involved a student who lived with relatives and did not pay for rent, utilities or phone; he retained his Puerto Rico driver's license and held only a part-time job that didn't indicate steps toward a permanent residence. <i>See Alicea-Rivera,</i> 12 F.Supp.2d at 246. This case is quite inapposite, relating primarily to the established principle that out-of-state college students are not domiciliaries of the state in which they go to school. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Likewise, we are somewhat perplexed by appellees' reliance on <i>Leon,</i> in which the court found that \"superficial\" ties such as bank accounts, voter registration and drivers' licenses did not &#8212; on their own &#8212; indicate a change of domicile. <i>Leon,</i> 848 F.Supp. at 318. However, studying for and taking the Florida bar exam is just the sort of \"complicated\" and skilled undertaking that the <i>Leon</i> court would have found more convincing evidence of a change of domicile. <i>Id.</i> Furthermore, the <i>Leon</i> court observed that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[It] is more significant to examine, however, the bridges back to Puerto Rico that she failed to burn. She resigned from her job, but her employer expected her to return.... It was her Puerto Rican checking account that was routinely as reflected by the activity in the check register used. Although she rented out a small apartment ..., she left her home, with all of the furniture, unoccupied. She did not even discontinue her utility services ... [H]er late model car was left in Puerto Rico, where it was ready and waiting for her upon her return.... Her main source of income, social security payments, continued to be sent to her Puerto Rico address. Likewise, she did not file federal, state or city tax return[s] using her Illinois address, in addition to the filing of her Puerto Rico income return.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> In the instant case, not one of these \"bridges\" remained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And finally, <i>Valent&#237;n,</i> 254 F.3d at 361, which at least presents comparable facts in that the plaintiff relocated in order to seek medical treatment, nevertheless involved a situation in which the plaintiff maintained much stronger connections with Puerto Rico and failed to establish any of comparable significance in Florida. Valent&#237;n lived with her sister during her stay in Florida, and kept the bulk of her personal belongings (including a car) in Puerto Rico. <i>Id.</i> at 361-62, 366. Significantly, Valent&#237;n did not resign from her position as a nurse in Puerto Rico and she never worked in Florida. She relied on a combination of sick days and unpaid leave to cover her stay. Carlos, on the other hand, actually worked in Miami &#8212; either from home or at a branch office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Correcting for the factual and legal errors, the remaining evidence predominantly establishes that Florida was the Garc&#237;as' \"true, fixed home and principal establishment,\" to which, whenever they were absent, they had the intention of returning. 13B Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure,</i> at &#167; 3612. <i>See also Valent&#237;n,</i> 254 F.3d at 366. The ties remaining with Puerto Rico &#8212; ongoing investments and the retention of property in order to benefit from supplemental rental income &#8212; are simply the vestiges of longtime prior residence on the island ... and a nostalgic hope for a far off future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, an evaluation of the relevant factors under the proper burden of proof leads us to the conclusion that the appellants were domiciled in Florida.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Reversed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We note that seven of the factors rely on the deposition testimony that the court did not have before it at the time of its decision</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The initial error seems to have been made in appellees' motion to dismiss, which cited<i>Alicea-Rivera v.

Alicea-Rivera</i> is in conflict with our earlier decision in <i>Bank One,</i> 964 F.2d at 50, and therefore has no precedential value on the burden of proof issue.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Upon questioning at oral argument, both parties agreed that the burden was preponderance of the evidence.

In March 1999, Carlos resigned from Goldman Antonetti and joined the Miami office of Rice Fowler, a law firm based in New Orleans.
