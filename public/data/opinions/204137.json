George A. O'Toole, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                    Torruella, Selya, and Howard,\n                           Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Mala M.

In this appeal, appellant\n\nDonna Cusson (\"Cusson\") challenges the district court's decision to\n\ngrant summary judgment to appellees Liberty Life Assurance Company\n\nof Boston (\"Liberty\") and the FleetBoston Financial Corporation\n\nLong-Term Disability Plan (\"LTD Plan\").         After Liberty terminated\n\nCusson's long-term disability (\"LTD\") benefits, Cusson sued in the\n\nU.S. District Court of Massachusetts, arguing that the termination\n\nof her benefits was improper under the Employee Retirement and\n\nIncome Security Act (\"ERISA\"), 29 U.S.C. §§ 1001-1431 (2006).            The\n\ndistrict court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants,\n\nand Cusson now appeals. After careful consideration, we affirm the\n\ndistrict court's judgment.\n\n                             I. Background1\n\nA. The Long-Term Disability Plan\n\n           Cusson was employed at FleetBoston as a Senior Facilities\n\nPlanner.   She was covered under both a short-term disability plan\n\n(\"STD Plan\") and the LTD Plan.      Liberty is both the administrator\n\nof and payer of benefits under the LTD Plan.          Under the terms of\n\nthe   insurance   policy   (\"the   Policy\")    for   the   LTD   Plan,   the\n\ndefinition of \"Disability\" or \"Disabled\" for LTD purposes varies\n\nover time with the duration of the disability.             For the initial\n\ntwenty-four-month period after a claimant switches into the LTD\n\n\n1\n   For additional background, see the decision below. Cusson v.\nLiberty Life Assurance Co., No. 78-3386, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS\n77084 (D. Mass. Sep. 30, 2008).\n\n                                   -2-\n\fPlan from the STD Plan, a person is considered \"disabled\" if she is\n\nunable to perform \"all of the material and substantial duties of\n\n[her] own occupation.\" However, after twenty-four months, a person\n\nis   considered   \"disabled\"   if   she   is   \"unable   to   perform,   with\n\nreasonable continuity, all of the material and substantial duties\n\nof [her] own or any other occupation for which [s]he is or becomes\n\nreasonably fitted by training, education, experience, and physical\n\nor mental capacity.\"\n\nB. Cusson's Fibromyalgia Diagnosis and Initial LTD Benefits Award\n\n            In March 2002, Cusson was diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\nShe began to receive benefits under the STD Plan in April 2002\n\nbecause of the pain and fatigue caused by her chemotherapy. Cusson\n\nwas notified on October 9, 2002 that she qualified for LTD benefits\n\nunder the Policy.       Liberty also informed Cusson that she was\n\nrequired to apply for Social Security Disability Income (\"SSDI\")\n\nbenefits.   Cusson's chemotherapy ended in October 2002.           However,\n\nshe continued to feel symptoms similar to what she felt during her\n\ncancer treatment, including dizziness, fatigue, headaches, and\n\nwidespread body pain.\n\n            In February 2003, Cusson's rheumatologist, Dr. James\n\nFigueroa     (\"Figueroa\"),     diagnosed       her   with     fibromyalgia.\n\nFibromyalgia is characterized by \"chronic and frequently difficult\n\nto manage pain in muscles and soft tissues surrounding joints.\"\n\nRose v. Hartford Fin. Servs. Group, 268 F. App'x. 444, 446 n.4 (6th\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fCir. 2008) (citing Taber's Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary 402 (19th\n\ned. 2001)).    A patient may be diagnosed with fibromyalgia if she\n\nhas (1) a history of widespread pain for at least three months and\n\n(2) pain in at least eleven out of eighteen tender point sites upon\n\ndigital palpation.     Id.   Symptoms of fibromyalgia can include\n\nstiffness, fatigue, and disturbed sleep. See Sarchet v. Chater, 78\n\nF.3d 305, 306 (7th Cir. 1996).\n\n           On March 28, 2003, at Liberty's request, Cusson completed\n\nan Activities Questionnaire, a document in which a claimant is\n\nasked to describe her day-to-day activities and her functional\n\nlimitations.    Cusson indicated that she was able to sit for\n\napproximately two hours, stand for fifteen to thirty minutes, and\n\nwalk for thirty to forty-five minutes.       She noted that these\n\nlengths of time were \"longer/shorter depending on the day and how\n\nI feel.\"   She also reported memory and concentration problems, and\n\nindicated that she was never able to predict how she would feel\n\nfrom one day to the next.\n\n           On August 21, 2003, at Liberty's request, Figueroa filled\n\nout a questionnaire regarding Cusson's condition.      Figueroa was\n\nasked to describe \"specific restrictions and limitations . . .\n\npreventing your patient from being able to work.\"     Figueroa also\n\nsubmitted a Physical Capacities Form, on which he reported that\n\nCusson could lift no more than ten pounds twice a day, could sit\n\nfor four hours per day but needed to stand up every fifteen\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fminutes, could stand for up to one hour but needed to sit every\n\nfive to ten minutes, and could walk for an hour but needed to rest\n\nevery few minutes.   Figueroa concluded that Cusson could not work\n\na full eight-hour day until her pain and fatigue subsided.\n\n           On March 15, 2004, Liberty notified Cusson that beginning\n\nSeptember 29, 2004, the definition of \"disabled\" under the Policy\n\nwould change, after which Cusson would have to be unable to perform\n\nall of the material and substantial duties of any occupation for\n\nwhich she was qualified.    On May 7, 2004, Figueroa, at Liberty's\n\nrequest, completed a Functional Capacities Form and a Restrictions\n\nForm.   The Functional Capacities Form asked Figueroa to list, for\n\nvarious activities, whether Cusson had \"[n]o [r]estrictions,\" could\n\nperform the activity \"[f]requently (1/3 to 2/3 of the time),\"\n\n\"[o]ccasionally (up to 1/3 of the time),\" or was \"[u]nable to\"\n\nperform the activity. Figueroa indicated that Cusson was \"[u]nable\n\nto\" squat, bend, kneel, climb, push or pull objects, or lift any\n\nweight over ten pounds.\n\nC. 2004 Review and Termination of Cusson's LTD Benefits\n\n           On May 18, 2004, Liberty hired Omega Insurance Services,\n\nInc. (\"Omega\") to conduct video surveillance of Cusson.      Eleven\n\ndays later, Liberty again told Cusson to apply for SSDI benefits,\n\nwarning that if she did not, Liberty would reduce her disability\n\nbenefit by the amount she was eligible to receive from the Social\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\fSecurity Administration (\"SSA\"). Liberty also informed Cusson that\n\nit would help her obtain SSDI benefits.\n\n          Omega conducted surveillance of Cusson on June 9-12, 17,\n\nand 24, 2004.    Omega videotaped Cusson when she was observed\n\noutside of her home, and it obtained fifty minutes and fifty-eight\n\nseconds of video over the course of these six days.       The video\n\nfootage that was obtained appeared to show Cusson engaged in normal\n\nactivities.   For example, on June 9, Cusson was observed walking\n\nher dog for approximately thirty minutes; according to the Omega\n\nreport, Cusson walked \"in a smooth, fluid manner without exhibiting\n\nany external signs of impairment.\"     Later that day she drove to a\n\nnearby Home Depot store and was seen exiting the store an hour\n\nlater carrying a shopping bag.     On June 24, Cusson was observed\n\nhaving lunch with a friend at a restaurant and then going to a Wal-\n\nMart.   Cusson was inside the Wal-Mart for almost one hour, after\n\nwhich she exited with a loaded shopping cart.   She loaded the items\n\nfrom her cart, including what Omega's report described as a large\n\nbag of cat litter, into her car, and she was also observed bending\n\nat the waist to pick up items that had fallen on the ground.\n\n          On July 20, 2004, Liberty told Cusson that if she did not\n\nprovide proof of her SSA application by August 3, 2004, Liberty\n\nwould immediately reduce her benefits by the estimated amount of\n\nthe SSDI benefit.    Liberty also instructed Omega to conduct a\n\nsecond round of surveillance.    This surveillance occurred between\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fJuly   26   and    28,   during    which    time    Cusson   was   seen   on   the\n\nsurveillance tape once, on July 27, for a total of one minute and\n\nseven seconds.\n\n            In August 2004, Liberty ordered a third round of video\n\nsurveillance. Omega performed this surveillance on August 2, 9-10,\n\n14, and 26.       Cusson was seen leaving her home only on August 26.\n\nCusson was observed bending fully at the waist to retrieve an item\n\noutside her front door.            She was then seen driving to a local\n\nrestaurant and eating lunch with another person, and was then seen\n\ndriving to a dry cleaner's, a Wal-Mart, and other department\n\nstores.      During the course of her errands, she was observed\n\ncarrying various items into and out of stores and bending at the\n\nwaist to retrieve items from or place items into her car.\n\n            On     September      15,    2004,     Cusson    completed    another\n\nActivities Questionnaire from Liberty, in which she described her\n\nfunctional limitations, including pain, fatigue, memory loss, and\n\ninability to concentrate.           Cusson reported that since her last\n\nActivities    Questionnaire       from     March   28,   2003,   she   could   not\n\nremember going to a mall because malls were \"just too big\";\n\ninstead, Cusson noted, she went \"mostly to small stores [with] easy\n\naccess in + out.\"        Cusson also reported that she had \"good\" days\n\nand \"bad\" days.      She said that on a \"good\" day she would be able to\n\nperform activities such as running errands, visiting other people,\n\nand having lunch outside her home.             However, she reported that on\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fa \"bad\" day she would be unable to sleep because of her pain and\n\nwould often be unable to get out of bed for several days.\n\n            On October 13, 2004, Figueroa reported to Liberty that,\n\nduring an eight-hour work day, Cusson could sit for less than two\n\nhours, stand for less than thirty minutes, and walk for fifteen\n\nminutes.    Figueroa also noted that Cusson could not lift or carry\n\nmore than ten pounds and could not work eight hours per day in any\n\noccupation.     Two days later, Figueroa reported to Liberty that\n\nCusson's \"limitations tend to vary with the severity of [her]\n\nsymptoms.\"\n\n            Upon receipt of Figueroa's reports, Liberty referred\n\nCusson's file to Dr. Robert Millstein (\"Millstein\"), a full-time\n\nLiberty employee, for review.         Millstein reviewed Cusson's claim\n\nand concluded that \"the video surveillance demonstrates functional\n\ncapacity which exceeds that reported on the most recent activities\n\nquestionnaire and confirms that the claimant retains the physical\n\ncapacity to perform full-time work at a light level.\"             Millstein\n\nnoted   a   number    of   apparent   inconsistencies   between   Cusson's\n\nreported limitations and the video surveillance.            For example,\n\nMillstein     noted   that   although   Cusson   reported   fatigue,   the\n\nsurveillance showed that \"on consecutive days, [Cusson] is seen out\n\nof her house for long periods of time performing activities which\n\nwould be best characterized as requiring light to medium physical\n\ncapacity.\" Thus, Millstein concluded, \"the record does not support\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fthe presence of fatigue which would preclude full-time work.\"\n\nMillstein also noted that Cusson was seen going into large stores,\n\nsuch as Wal-Mart and Home Depot, even though she had previously\n\nreported that she did not go to malls because malls were too big.\n\nMillstein also noted that Cusson was seen bending at the waist and\n\nplacing a large object, a bag of cat litter, in her car.\n\n           Millstein's report contained inaccurate statements about\n\nthe surveillance results.    Millstein frequently confused sightings\n\nof Cusson returning home with sightings of Cusson leaving her home.\n\nMillstein also said that on certain days Cusson left her home and\n\nremained out of her home for long periods, when in fact the\n\nsurveillance for those days clearly shows that Cusson returned to\n\nher home at various points throughout the day.       As a result of\n\nthese errors, Millstein's report overstates the amount of time\n\nCusson spent outside of her home on certain days, sometimes by as\n\nmuch as a factor of three.\n\n           In November 2004, Liberty ordered a fourth round of\n\nsurveillance, this time conducted by MJM Investigations, Inc.\n\n(\"MJM\").   MJM observed Cusson on November 2-6 and 11, 2004.   Cusson\n\nwas seen outside of her home for a total of roughly half an hour\n\nover the course of the surveillance.      On November 2, Cusson was\n\nobserved exiting her house carrying various bags and leaving her\n\nhome as the passenger in a car.    On November 4 and 11, Cusson was\n\n\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fbriefly seen driving to various locations to run errands.                   Cusson\n\nwas not seen outside of her home on November 3, 5, or 6.\n\n          On November 29, 2004, Liberty conducted a Transferable\n\nSkills Analysis and Labor Market Survey (\"TSA\") of Cusson's claim,\n\nrelying solely on Millstein's report.            The analysis concluded that\n\nCusson could perform her occupation as a Facilities Manager as well\n\nas other occupations, such as Construction Manager, Property/Real\n\nEstate Manager, and Civil Engineer.\n\n          On   December     8,    2004,      Liberty   sent   Cusson    a   letter\n\ninforming her that her benefits were being terminated.                 The letter\n\ndiscussed the video surveillance and Millstein's review of Cusson's\n\nfile.   The letter also noted the results of the TSA and informed\n\nCusson that she was capable of performing her original job as a\n\nFacility Planner.       In addition, the letter noted that Liberty had\n\nwritten to Figueroa requesting a response to Millstein's report and\n\nthe video surveillance, but that Figueroa had not responded.\n\nD. Cusson's Appeal and Further Tests\n\n          On June 1, 2005, Cusson notified Liberty that she was\n\nappealing its decision to terminate her benefits. Cusson submitted\n\nvarious documents, including her own sworn statement; affidavits\n\nfrom her friends, family, and former colleagues; and a chart\n\ncomparing the surveillance reports with her own recollection of her\n\nactivities   on   the    days    she   was    surveilled.      Cusson's      sworn\n\nstatement and activity chart indicate that on some of the days she\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\fwas seen outside of her home, she would \"hit a wall\" and return\n\nhome    \"crying    in   pain.\"     However,      Cusson's    activity    chart      is\n\ncompletely silent as to what she was doing, or what symptoms she\n\nwas experiencing, on many days when she was not observed outside of\n\nher home.\n\n            Cusson also submitted medical reports from in-person\n\nexaminations by Dr. Peter Schur (\"Schur\"), a rheumatologist, and\n\nDrs. Daniel Cohen (\"Cohen\") and Jean Matheson (\"Matheson\"), who\n\nspecialize in sleep disorders. Schur's examination was paid for by\n\nCusson's    health      insurer   as   part     of   her   treatment.         Schur's\n\nexamination       indicated    that    Cusson    had   limited   motion       in   her\n\nshoulders, hips, and back; had \"fair muscle tone at best\"; and was\n\npainfully sensitive to touch.             Schur concluded that Cusson was\n\ndisabled \"at present,\" and recommended treatment options.                       Cohen\n\nand Matheson indicated that Cusson had trouble sleeping because of\n\nher pain, but they did not render an opinion as to disability.\n\n            Cusson also submitted a report from Paul Blatchford, Ed.\n\nM.     (\"Blatchford\"),     a     vocational     rehabilitation        expert,      who\n\nconducted     an     in-person     evaluation        on    February     15,     2005.\n\nBlatchford's report detailed Cusson's impaired performance on a\n\nvariety of standardized vocational tests approved by the United\n\nStates Department of Labor (\"DOL\").              The report noted that Cusson\n\nappeared exhausted and distracted throughout the entire proceeding.\n\nBlatchford noted that under DOL guidelines, the occupations for\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fwhich Cusson was qualified required \"sedentary\" to \"light\" exertion\n\nlevels.   Blatchford concluded that Cusson's functional capacity\n\nprecluded her from performing and sustaining any work-related\n\nactivities.     Blatchford also disputed Liberty's interpretation of\n\nthe surveillance videos.             He argued that the videos failed to\n\naddress   Cusson's       cognitive    limitations.       He    also    noted      that\n\nalthough the video showed that Cusson was capable of short periods\n\nof activity, a fact that she herself had reported, it did not show\n\nCusson engaged in sustained activity that would be necessary for\n\nany kind of employment.\n\n           On July 26, 2005, Liberty informed Cusson that it had\n\nreferred her file for two peer reviews.          Both reviews were paid for\n\nby   Liberty.      One    review     was   conducted    by    Dr.    Walter    Longo\n\n(\"Longo\"),    an   oncologist,       who   determined    that       there   was   \"no\n\nobjective data supporting ongoing impairment due to prior therapy\"\n\nfor breast cancer, but that it was possible that Cusson could have\n\nlimitations due to fibromyalgia.            The other was conducted by Dr.\n\nJeffrey Liebermann (\"Liebermann\"), a rheumatologist, who concluded\n\nthat Cusson \"should be able to perform the duties of light or\n\nsedentary occupations\" despite her fibromyalgia, and that Cusson's\n\nimpairments were \"entirely subjective.\" Liebermann also claimed to\n\nhave spoken on the phone with Figueroa.            Liebermann reported that\n\nduring his conversation with Figueroa, Figueroa said that he had\n\ntold Cusson that he no longer wished to be consulted about the\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fdisability aspects of her case.         On August 11, 2005, Liebermann\n\nsent Figueroa a letter purporting to summarize their conversation\n\nand   requesting     that    Figueroa   review    and   make    comments     or\n\ncorrections to the letter and fax it back to him.            Figueroa did not\n\nsign the letter or return it.\n\n            On September 7, 2005, Cusson underwent an examination by\n\nDr. Mitchell Abramson (\"Abramson\").         Abramson reported that Cusson\n\nhad \"multiple trigger points\" for pain and was unable to bend\n\nforward more than forty degrees due to back pain.                      Abramson\n\nconcluded that Cusson \"appear[ed] to be disabled due to her medical\n\nillness.\"    On September 9, 2005, Blatchford wrote an addendum to\n\nhis February 15, 2005 report, stating that Liberty's interpretation\n\nof the surveillance reports was \"inaccurate, and contradicted by\n\nthe videotapes themselves.\"         Blatchford noted that the video of\n\nCusson running errands was \"consistent with [Cusson's] ability to\n\nperform activities for limited periods of time,\" but that Cusson's\n\nneed for frequent rest and her \"tendency to 'fade' after engaging\n\nin any task for a sustained period of time\" showed that she\n\n\"lack[ed]   the    ability    to   engage   in   sustained     work,    whether\n\nsedentary or otherwise.\"\n\n            Cusson    submitted      Abramson's    report,      Blatchford's\n\naddendum, and other documentation to Liberty on September 15, 2005.\n\nIn response, Liberty conducted a second round of peer reviews.\n\nBoth of these additional reviews were conducted by MLS National\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fMedical Evaluations, Inc. (\"MLS\") and paid for by Liberty.                                The\n\nfirst    review   was      conducted      by    Dr.    Reynold         Karr   (\"Karr\"),      a\n\nrheumatologist,        who    concluded        that    he    did      not    \"identify     any\n\nobjective      medical     basis    for    impairment            or   need    for   physical\n\nrestrictions based upon review of the accompanying medical record.\"\n\nThe    second   MLS    review      was    conducted         by    Dr.   Matthew      Kaufman\n\n(\"Kaufman\"), an oncologist.                Kaufman indicated that, from his\n\nperspective      as   an     oncologist,       there    was       no    \"identifiable       or\n\nmedically supported level of functional impairment that can be\n\nobjectively verified.\"           However, Kaufman noted that fibromyalgia\n\nfell outside his area of expertise, and conceded that Cusson \"may\n\nhave a level of functional impairment due to . . . fibromyalgia\n\nand/or psychological overlay.\"\n\n              On November 1, 2005, Liberty upheld its decision to\n\nterminate Cusson's benefits.               Liberty stated that \"based on the\n\ntotality of clinical and objective medical documentation contained\n\nin    Ms.   Cusson's     file,     sedentary      to    light         capacity      has   been\n\nestablished.\"\n\nE. Award of SSDI Benefits\n\n              On January 21, 2006, an Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\")\n\nawarded Cusson SSDI benefits, with a disability date of March 15,\n\n2002.       In granting the benefits, the ALJ found that Cusson was\n\n\"unable to do sustained work activities in an ordinary work setting\n\non a regular and continuing basis.\"\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\fF. District Court Proceedings\n\n            On December 7, 2005, Cusson filed suit against Liberty\n\nand the LTD Plan in the District of Massachusetts under ERISA, 29\n\nU.S.C. § 1001 et seq.          Cusson sought to recover her benefits\n\npursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B).                Liberty answered and\n\nasserted a counterclaim seeking reimbursement for overpayment of\n\nbenefits under the Policy as a result of Cusson having received\n\nSSDI   benefits.    The   parties     filed    cross-motions       for   summary\n\njudgment on all issues.\n\n            Because the LTD Plan gave Liberty discretion to determine\n\neligibility for benefits, the district court applied an abuse of\n\ndiscretion standard to Liberty's decision.                Under this standard,\n\nLiberty's   decision   would    be   upheld     if   it    was   \"reasoned   and\n\nsupported by substantial evidence.\"            Gannon v. Metro. Life Ins.\n\nCo., 360 F.3d 211, 213 (1st Cir. 2004).                    The district court\n\nrecognized that Liberty had a structural conflict of interest,\n\nsince it both evaluated benefit claims and paid the benefits.\n\nHowever, the district court, citing the Supreme Court's decision in\n\nMetropolitan Life Insurance Co. v. Glenn, held that even in the\n\nface of a conflict, the standard of review remained deferential,\n\nand that the conflict was \"one factor among many that a reviewing\n\njudge must take into account.\"        128 S. Ct. 2343, 2351 (2008).\n\n            Cusson made two main arguments in her district court case\n\nopposing the denial of benefits.            First, she argued that Liberty\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fand its reviewers improperly used and interpreted the surveillance\n\nvideos.     Second, she argued that Liberty's review process was\n\nflawed, and that these flaws showed that Liberty's decision was an\n\nabuse of discretion.       The district court held that Liberty's\n\ndecision to terminate her benefits was not an abuse of discretion.\n\nWith respect to the surveillance results, the court held that,\n\nalthough the surveillance supported the inference that Cusson could\n\nnot perform sustained activity, the surveillance also supported the\n\ninference    that   \"Cusson   and    Dr.   Figueroa    had    significantly\n\noverstated [Cusson's] functional limitations.\"               The court also\n\nrejected    Cusson's   various   claims    of   procedural    unfairness   in\n\nLiberty's review process.        In addition to upholding Liberty's\n\ndecision to terminate Cusson's benefits, the court also granted\n\nsummary judgment to Liberty on its counterclaim.\n\n            Cusson now appeals the district court's decision.\n\n                              II. Discussion\n\nA. Applicable Law and Standard of Review\n\n            We review a district court's grant of summary judgment de\n\nnovo.     Thompson v. Coca-Cola Co., 522 F.3d 168, 175 (1st Cir.\n\n2008).     Normally, when we review a district court's grant of\n\nsummary judgment, \"[w]e will reverse only if, after reviewing the\n\nfacts and making all inferences in favor of the non-moving party\n\n[here, Cusson], the evidence on record is sufficiently open-ended\n\nto permit a rational factfinder to resolve the issue in favor of\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\feither side.\" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). However, in\n\nan ERISA benefit-denial context, \"the district court sits more as\n\nan appellate tribunal than as a trial court.\"                    Leahy v. Raytheon\n\nCorp., 315 F.3d 11, 18 (1st Cir. 2002).                   In such cases, \"summary\n\njudgment     is   simply   a   vehicle     for       deciding   the    issue,\"   and,\n\nconsequently, \"the non-moving party is not entitled to the usual\n\ninferences in its favor.\"          Orndorf v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co.,\n\n404 F.3d 510, 517 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n             When an ERISA plan gives the administrator the discretion\n\nto   determine    eligibility      for    benefits        (as   in    this   case),    a\n\nreviewing court must uphold that decision unless it is \"arbitrary,\n\ncapricious, or an abuse of discretion.\"                   Gannon, 360 F.3d at 213\n\n(citing Vlass v. Raytheon Employees Disability Trust, 244 F.3d 27,\n\n30 (1st Cir. 2001)).           However, Cusson argues that the Supreme\n\nCourt's decision in Glenn changed the standard of review from an\n\nabuse of discretion standard to a \"combination of factors\" standard\n\nin   cases   where,   as   here,    there       is    a   structural    conflict      of\n\ninterest.     We disagree.\n\n             In deciding what effect a conflict would have on the\n\nstandard of review, the Supreme Court in Glenn \"elucidate[d] what\n\n[the] Court said in Firestone, namely, that a conflict should 'be\n\nweighed as a factor in determining whether there is an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.'\"      Glenn, 128 S. Ct. at 2350 (quoting Firestone Tire &\n\nRubber Co. v. Bruch, 489 U.S. 101, 115 (1989)).                 However, the Court\n\n\n                                         -17-\n\fwent on to say, \"We do not believe that Firestone's statement\n\nimplies a change in the standard of review, say, from deferential\n\nto de novo review.\"    Id.   Rather, the Court said that \"Firestone\n\nmeans what the word 'factor' implies, namely, that when judges\n\nreview the lawfulness of benefit denials, they will often take\n\naccount of several different considerations of which a conflict of\n\ninterest is one.\"   Id. at 2351.\n\n          Because Glenn did not alter the standard of review, and\n\nbecause our review of the lower court's grant of summary judgment\n\nis de novo, we will review Liberty's decision to deny Cusson's\n\nbenefits under the same abuse of discretion standard used by the\n\ndistrict court. See Denmark v. Liberty Life Assurance Co. (Denmark\n\nIII), 566 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2009) (where the plan administrator\n\nhas discretion, \"Glenn's baseline principle, consistent with this\n\ncircuit's prior precedents, [is] that judicial review of such a\n\nbenefit-denial decision is for abuse of discretion\").\n\nB. Appropriate Weight Given to the Conflict of Interest\n\n          Although the presence of a conflict of interest does not\n\nchange the standard of review in this case, the conflict itself\n\ncan, under certain circumstances, be accorded extra weight in the\n\ncourt's analysis.     In Glenn, the Supreme Court held that \"[t]he\n\nconflict of interest at issue . . . should prove more important\n\n(perhaps of great importance) where circumstances suggest a higher\n\nlikelihood that it affected the benefits decision, including, but\n\n\n                                -18-\n\fnot limited to, cases where an insurance company administrator has\n\na history of biased claims administration.\"            128 S. Ct. at 2351.\n\nOn the other hand, the conflict \"should prove less important\n\n(perhaps to the vanishing point) where the administrator has taken\n\nactive steps to reduce potential bias and to promote accuracy.\"\n\nId.\n\n           We have interpreted this language from Glenn to mean that\n\n\"courts   are    duty-bound   to    inquire     into   what   steps   a   plan\n\nadministrator has taken to insulate the decisionmaking process\n\nagainst   the     potentially      pernicious     effects     of   structural\n\nconflicts.\"     Denmark III, 566 F.3d at 9.        Although Cusson argues\n\nthat it is Liberty's burden to show that the conflict did not\n\naffect its decision, the Supreme Court explicitly declined to\n\nspecify a burden-of-proof rule for determining the weight that a\n\nconflict should be given.       See Glenn, 128 S. Ct. at 2351 (\"Neither\n\ndo we believe it necessary or desirable for courts to create\n\nspecial burden-of-proof rules, or other special procedural or\n\nevidentiary     rules,   focused   narrowly     upon   the    evaluator/payer\n\nconflict.\").     We therefore apply the same burden of proof to the\n\nconflict issue that we do to any other aspect of an ERISA claim for\n\nimproper denial of benefits; hence, Cusson bears the burden of\n\nshowing that the conflict influenced Liberty's decision. See Terry\n\nv. Bayer Corp., 145 F.3d 28, 34 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"Here, [claimant]\n\nbears the burden of making a showing sufficient to establish a\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\fviolation of ERISA, namely, that the benefit termination was\n\nunreasonable.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n            Cusson has not raised (and, thus, the parties have not\n\nbriefed) the issue of the adequacy of Liberty's internal procedures\n\nto insulate the review process from the conflict.             Instead, Cusson\n\nargues that certain alleged flaws in the way the review was\n\nconducted prove that Liberty's decision was influenced by its\n\nconflict.    As discussed below, we do not find that these alleged\n\nflaws show that Liberty was improperly influenced by its conflict.\n\n            Firstly, Cusson argues that Liberty relied exclusively on\n\nMillstein's report, including his inaccurate statements about the\n\nsurveillance results, rather than relying on the totality of the\n\nrecord.     Cusson correctly points out that in its initial denial\n\nletter, Liberty quoted language that it claimed was from the\n\nsurveillance    reports,     but   that   was    actually    from   Millstein's\n\ninterpretation of the surveillance.             Liberty also claimed that it\n\nrelied on its TSA, but the record indicates that the TSA was based\n\nsolely on Millstein's report.\n\n            We find nothing wrong with the degree of Liberty's\n\nreliance on Millstein's report.           Although the denial letter from\n\nLiberty quoted Millstein's summary of the surveillance data, and\n\nnot the surveillance reports themselves, the record also indicates\n\nthat Liberty's case manager did review the tapes. Moreover, as the\n\ndistrict    court   noted,    even   though      Millstein   made   inaccurate\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\fstatements about the surveillance data in his report, Millstein's\n\nmain substantive point about the surveillance -- that it showed\n\nCusson engaged in activities that she claimed she could not do --\n\nwas accurate.    Many of the activities that Cusson was observed\n\ndoing were activities that she specifically reported being unable\n\nto do, such as bending at the waist and lifting objects heavier\n\nthan ten pounds.   Moreover, when Cusson was seen outside, she did\n\nnot appear to show any signs of fatigue or impaired physical\n\ncapabilities.   While this is by no means ironclad proof of ability\n\nto work, it is evidence that Liberty was entitled to consider.      We\n\nread Liberty's decision as being based not simply on the amount of\n\nactivity observed, but also on the nature of the activity observed,\n\nand Millstein's report contained no errors with respect to the\n\nlatter.\n\n            Next, Cusson argues that Liberty improperly relied on\n\nLiebermann's    hearsay   testimony   about   his   conversation   with\n\nFigueroa.   Liebermann claimed that he spoke with Figueroa and that\n\nFigueroa \"understood that there was a significant discrepancy\n\nbetween the claimant's reported functionality and what was seen on\n\nthe surveillance tapes.\"    Liebermann further claimed that Figueroa\n\nindicated that he had told Cusson that he no longer wished to be\n\ninvolved in the disability aspect of her case.        However, Cusson\n\nnoted that Figueroa never responded to Liebermann's request to sign\n\noff on Liebermann's account of their conversation.       Thus, Cusson\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\fargues, Liebermann's entire account of the conversation is hearsay\n\nthat neither Liberty nor the district court should have relied on\n\nin its decision.\n\n            However, \"[a] plan administrator is not a court of law\n\nand is not bound by the rules of evidence.\"           Speciale v. Blue Cross\n\n& Blue Shield Ass'n, 538 F.3d 615, 622 n.4 (7th Cir. 2008).\n\nBecause Figueroa never responded to Liebermann's request to comment\n\non his account of the conversation, it was not an abuse of\n\ndiscretion for Liberty to assume that Liebermann's account of the\n\nconversation was accurate.           Since Cusson never presented Liberty\n\nwith any evidence to challenge directly Liebermann's account of the\n\nconversation,      we    find    nothing   inappropriate    about    Liberty's\n\nreliance on that account.\n\n            Cusson next argues that Liberty's reviewing physicians\n\nwere     biased   against       patients   with    fibromyalgia.      Although\n\nLiebermann's report mentions some of the evidence submitted by\n\nCusson, Cusson alleges that Liebermann reached his conclusion about\n\nher ability to work without actually analyzing the medical evidence\n\nin her file.      In his report, Liebermann stated: \"This claimant has\n\na diagnosis of [f]ibromyalgia.             As such, she should be able to\n\nperform the duties of light or sedentary occupations.\"                  Cusson\n\nargues    that    this   statement     indicates    that   Liebermann   had   a\n\npreconceived notion that fibromyalgia could never be a disabling\n\ndiagnosis, and thus did not fairly consider her file.               Similarly,\n\n\n                                       -22-\n\fMillstein   cited    a   1986   study   of   fibromyalgia   patients   that\n\nindicated that most of them were eventually able to return to work.\n\nCusson points out that the Seventh Circuit has held that \"[t]he\n\nfact that the majority of individuals suffering from fibromyalgia\n\ncan work is the weakest possible evidence that [an individual\n\nclaimant] can.\"     Hawkins v. First Union Corp. Long Term Disability\n\nPlan, 326 F.3d 914, 919 (7th Cir. 2003).\n\n            If Liebermann or Millstein had said that fibromyalgia\n\npatients are never disabled, those statements would be clearly\n\nwrong.   However, although Liebermann and Millstein made statements\n\nthat might be interpreted as improper generalizations, it does not\n\nnecessarily follow that they relied on such generalizations when\n\nissuing their reports. Had either doctor concluded that Cusson was\n\nnot disabled because fibromyalgia is never or not always disabling,\n\nthat conclusion would have been inappropriate.              However, both\n\ndoctors' reports indicate that they reviewed the surveillance\n\nfootage and based their conclusions on the apparent contradiction\n\nbetween the footage and Cusson's reported impairments.\n\n            Cusson also argues that Liberty's reliance on paper file\n\nreviews instead of direct medical examinations shows that it was\n\ninfluenced by its conflict.       Cusson acknowledges that this court\n\nhas found \"a nonexamining physician's review of a claimant's file\n\n[to be] . . . reliable medical evidence.\"        Gannon, 360 F.3d at 214.\n\nHowever, Cusson argues that the particular circumstances of this\n\n\n                                   -23-\n\fcase warrant a preference for reports by examining physicians. She\n\nnotes that fibromyalgia is a disease that can only be diagnosed by\n\na clinical examination of a patient based on subjective reports of\n\npain. Certain circuits have held that in such cases some deference\n\nto examining physicians is appropriate.            See, e.g., Kalish v.\n\nLiberty Life Assurance Co., 419 F.3d 501, 509-10 (6th Cir. 2005);\n\nHawkins, 326 F.3d at 919 (the \"gravest problem\" with the opinion\n\noffered by an ERISA plan administrator's paper-reviewing doctor was\n\nhis refusal to accept \"subjective symptoms\" of pain and fatigue\n\nknown to be associated with fibromyalgia).         Moreover, Cusson notes\n\nthat Liberty's reviewing physicians were paid for their reports by\n\nLiberty, whereas Cusson's treating physicians were paid by her\n\nhealth insurance company.      The Supreme Court has recognized that\n\n\"physicians repeatedly retained by benefits plans may have an\n\nincentive to make a finding of 'not disabled' in order to save\n\ntheir   employers    money   and   to   preserve   their   own   consulting\n\narrangements.\"      Black & Decker Disability Plan v. Nord, 538 U.S.\n\n822, 832 (2003) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n           We see no reason why the nonexamining physicians' reports\n\nin this case are unreliable.       We recognize that fibromyalgia is a\n\ndisease that is diagnosed primarily based on a patient's self-\n\nreported pain symptoms.        However, Liberty's reviewers did not\n\nquestion the diagnosis of fibromyalgia; instead, they questioned\n\nthe effect of the disease on Cusson's ability to work.             \"[T]his\n\n\n                                   -24-\n\fcourt draws a distinction between requiring objective evidence of\n\nthe diagnosis, which is impermissible for a condition such as\n\nfibromyalgia that does not lend itself to objective verification,\n\nand requiring objective evidence that the plaintiff is unable to\n\nwork, which is allowed.\"       Denmark v. Liberty Life Assurance Co.\n\n(Denmark II), 481 F.3d 16, 37 (1st Cir. 2007), vacated on other\n\ngrounds, 566 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2009).       Because it is permissible to\n\nrequire documented, objective evidence of disability, it was not\n\ninappropriate for Liberty's reviewers to rely on the lack of such\n\ndocumented evidence, or on the footage that contradicted Cusson's\n\nreports of limitations, in making their recommendations.              The fact\n\nthat Liberty's reviewers were paid for their reports does not, by\n\nitself, lead us to believe that Liberty was influenced by its\n\nconflict, since Cusson has provided no evidence that Liberty\n\nretained its reviewers specifically because they have a record of\n\ndenying claims.\n\n            Next, Cusson claims that Liberty failed to provide her\n\ncomplete medical record to its reviewers. Liberty's internal files\n\nindicated    that   \"[a]ll   medical   records\"   had   been   sent    to   its\n\nreviewers.    However, the reviewers did not list certain documents\n\nthat were favorable to Cusson -- such as various medical records,\n\nher activity log, and portions of the surveillance reports that\n\nshowed no activity -- in their reports.           The district court held\n\nthat under our holding in Tsoulas v. Liberty Life Assurance Co., it\n\n\n                                   -25-\n\fwould be improper for the court automatically to assume that unless\n\nthe medical report lists each item the examiner reviewed, he or she\n\ndid not review it.   See 454 F.3d 69, 77 (1st Cir. 2006).    However,\n\nCusson argues that the district court's reliance on Tsoulas was\n\nincorrect.   Cusson points out that in Tsoulas, the plaintiff's\n\nclaim that Liberty failed to provide certain documents to the\n\nreviewers was obviously incorrect because some of the documents\n\nthat the plaintiff said were missing were explicitly listed in\n\nthose same reviewers' reports.     Id.   In contrast, the documents\n\nthat Cusson claims were not provided are not listed in any of\n\nLiberty's reviewers' reports.2\n\n          Cusson's attempt to distinguish Tsoulas from this case\n\nfails.   Contrary to Cusson's position, the reviewing physician\n\nreports in Tsoulas did not explicitly mention certain reports that\n\nthe claimant said were missing; rather, the district court inferred\n\nthat those documents were provided because the physicians' reports\n\nlisted some, but not all, of the documents.   See id.   Likewise, in\n\nthis case, each of the reviewing physicians' reports list at least\n\nsome of the supplementary material provided by Cusson.      Hence, in\n\nthis case, as in Tsoulas, we find no reason to believe that Liberty\n\ndid not supply the entire record.\n\n\n2\n   Cusson also argues that, in the wake of Glenn, the district\ncourt was wrong to place the burden of proof on her to show that\nthe records were not provided. However, as we noted above, the\nSupreme Court explicitly chose not to impose any new burden-of-\nproof rules with respect to conflicts.\n\n                                 -26-\n\f          Finally, Cusson argues that Liberty's failure to credit\n\nthe SSA's award of disability benefits shows that Liberty was\n\ninfluenced by its conflict.     Cusson notes that Liberty insisted\n\nthat she apply for SSDI benefits, which she was awarded, but now\n\nseeks to benefit financially from that award by claiming the right\n\nto reimbursement for overpayment.    Cusson notes that in Glenn, the\n\nSupreme Court treated this behavior as evidence that a conflict\n\ninfluenced the plan administrator's judgment.      In Glenn, the plan\n\nadministrator encouraged the claimant to apply for SSDI benefits\n\nand then recovered the bulk of those benefits by virtue of the\n\nreimbursement provision.   The administrator then turned around and\n\ndenied benefits for the same disability that it had encouraged the\n\nclaimant to plead to the SSA.   The Court held:\n\n          This course of events was not only an\n          important factor in its own right (because it\n          suggested procedural unreasonableness), but\n          also would have justified the court in giving\n          more weight to the conflict (because MetLife's\n          seemingly inconsistent positions were both\n          financially advantageous).\n\nGlenn, 128 S. Ct. at 2352.\n\n          We find nothing suspicious about Liberty's failure to\n\ncredit Cusson's successful application for SSDI benefits, because\n\nCusson was not awarded SSDI benefits until after Liberty denied her\n\nLTD benefits.    We have held that when reviewing an insurer's\n\ndecision to deny benefits, we determine whether \"the insurer's\n\neligibility   determination   was   unreasonable   in   light   of   the\n\n\n                                -27-\n\finformation available to it when it made its decision.\"                     Denmark\n\nII, 481 F.3d at 39 (internal quotation mark omitted).                  Because the\n\nSSA's award of benefits had not yet occurred when Liberty made its\n\ndecision, that fact could not have been known to Liberty.\n\n              In summary, as discussed above, we do not find that\n\nLiberty's decision was improperly influenced by its structural\n\nconflict of interest.             We therefore do not accord any special\n\nweight   to    the   conflict      in    our   analysis   of   whether    Liberty's\n\ndecision was proper, but rather consider it along with all of the\n\nfactors present in this case to determine if Liberty's ultimate\n\nconclusion regarding Cusson's benefits was \"reasoned and supported\n\nby substantial evidence.\"            Gannon, 360 F.3d at 213.            We turn to\n\nthis question below.\n\nC. Whether Liberty's Decision Was an Abuse of Discretion\n\n              Cusson argues that the factors discussed in Section\n\nII(B), supra, which she claims show that Liberty was influenced by\n\nits conflict, also show that Liberty's ultimate decision was an\n\nabuse of discretion. For the same reasons we articulated above, we\n\ndo not believe that these factors prove that Liberty's decision was\n\nan abuse of discretion.\n\n              Cusson further argues that, contrary to the conclusions\n\nof Liberty and its reviewers, the surveillance video does not\n\nactually contradict any of her self-reported disabilities.                   Cusson\n\nnever    claimed     that   she    was    entirely   incapable    of     performing\n\n\n                                          -28-\n\fnormally; rather, she only claimed that she was unable to function\n\nnormally   most      of   the   time.      Thus,   Cusson       argues,    given    how\n\ninfrequently she was seen outside of her home during the course of\n\nthe surveillance, the surveillance is consistent with her claim of\n\ndisability, and it was an abuse of discretion for Liberty to use it\n\nas evidence against her claim.             Cusson notes that the surveillance\n\nvideo represents a mere two hour snapshot from twenty days of her\n\nlife over the course of four months.3                   Cusson cites a number of\n\ncases in which courts have held that it was an abuse of discretion\n\nto rely on such limited surveillance data.                   See, e.g., Soron v.\n\nLiberty Life Assurance Co., 2005 WL 1173076, at *11 (N.D.N.Y.\n\nMay 2, 2005) (surveillance cannot be used to discount plaintiff's\n\nself-reported symptoms where \"it shows her performing isolated\n\nactivities     for    brief     periods    of    time    with   no   revelation      of\n\nconsequences\"); Osbun v. Auburn Foundry, Inc., 293 F. Supp. 2d 863,\n\n870 (N.D. Ind. 2003) (1.5 hours of surveillance video over two days\n\nfell   short    of    demonstrating        that    plaintiff      was     capable   of\n\n\n\n3\n   Cusson argued to the district court that Liberty's internal\ntraining manuals regarding video surveillance should have been\nadmitted to the record. The district court denied this request\nbecause Cusson did not demonstrate a \"very good reason\" for the\ninclusion of the manuals.      See Liston v. UNUM Corp. Officer\nSeverance Plan, 330 F.3d 19, 23 (1st Cir. 2003). Cusson challenges\nthis decision on appeal. However, Cusson does not clearly explain\nwhy these documents would assist this court in determining whether\nLiberty's decision was an abuse of discretion. Because we do not\nsee why these documents would be relevant to this case, we do not\nreach the issue of whether the district court properly excluded\nthem.\n\n                                          -29-\n\fsustaining a job); Cross v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 292 F. App'x.\n\n888, 892 (11th Cir. 2008) (five days of surveillance resulting in\n\ntwo hours of video provided a \"mere snapshot\" of plaintiff's\n\nactivities   and   failed   to   take   into    account   impact   of    those\n\nactivities on plaintiff).\n\n          We   conclude     that   it     was   reasonable    to   use    the\n\nsurveillance as evidence against Cusson's claim of disability.              We\n\nhave permitted ERISA plan administrators to use this type of\n\nsporadic evidence in the past.      See, e.g., Denmark II, 481 F.3d at\n\n38 (it was not arbitrary and capricious for Liberty to consider\n\nreports and photographs from four days of surveillance that showed\n\nclaimant outside only for short periods of time on two of the four\n\ndays); Tsoulas, 454 F.3d at 79 (no abuse of discretion where\n\nLiberty considered surveillance evidence consisting of four hours\n\nper day for three days even though it only represented a \"small --\n\nimpliedly non-representative -- fraction of each day\").                  More\n\nimportantly, although the limited amount of time she was seen\n\noutside her home is a factor that weighs in Cusson's favor, Liberty\n\nwas certainly entitled to take notice of the fact that the video\n\nshows Cusson doing particular activities that she claimed she could\n\nnot do.   For example, she is seen going into large stores on two\n\nseparate occasions, despite having claimed that she avoided malls\n\nbecause they were too big and preferred small stores.          While we of\n\ncourse recognize that a Home Depot or a Wal-Mart is not the same\n\n\n                                   -30-\n\fthing as a mall, we cannot say that it was an abuse of discretion\n\nfor Liberty and its reviewers to conclude that Cusson's apparent\n\nability to navigate very large stores contradicted her claim that\n\nher   illness     required     her    to    frequent    small     stores.      The\n\nsurveillance also shows Cusson bending, kneeling, picking up large\n\nobjects such as a bag of cat litter, and pushing a loaded cart,\n\ndespite the fact that the Functional Capacities Form completed by\n\nFigueroa on May 4, 2004 indicated that Cusson was physically unable\n\nto perform these activities.\n\n            Because we find that Liberty was entitled to credit the\n\nsurveillance, we are left to determine whether Liberty's ultimate\n\nconclusion was supported by the totality of the evidence.                   We find\n\nthat it was.      Cusson argues that Liberty failed to consider her\n\nobjective evidence of disability.              However, the record reflects\n\nthat Liberty reached its decision not because it failed to consider\n\nthe evidence in Cusson's favor, but because it determined that the\n\nsurveillance     results     undermined     the     credibility    of   important\n\nportions of that evidence.           Because we review Liberty's decision\n\nunder an abuse of discretion standard, we must uphold it if we find\n\nthat it was \"reasoned and supported by substantial evidence in the\n\nrecord.\"4       Vlass,   244   F.3d    at     30   (internal    quotation    marks\n\n\n4\n    In our prior ERISA cases, we have variously described the\nstandard of review, applicable when an ERISA plan grants the plan\nadministrator the discretion to determine eligibility for benefits,\nas review for \"abuse of discretion,\" \"arbitrariness and\ncapriciousness,\" and \"substantial evidence.\" In the ERISA benefit-\n\n                                       -31-\n\fomitted).      \"Evidence      is    substantial    when   it    is   reasonably\n\nsufficient    to   support    a    conclusion.    Evidence     contrary   to   an\n\nadministrator's decision does not make the decision unreasonable,\n\nprovided substantial evidence supports the decision.\" Wright v. R.\n\nR. Donnelley & Sons Co. Group Benefits Plan, 402 F.3d 67, 74 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).    Because we cannot say that the evidence in this case\n\nwas   insufficient    to     support   Liberty's    conclusion,      we   affirm\n\nLiberty's decision to terminate Cusson's benefits.\n\nD. Whether Liberty's Counterclaim Is Allowed\n\n            Liberty asserted a counterclaim to recover Cusson's SSDI\n\nbenefits under 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(3), which states that a plan\n\nfiduciary can bring a civil action to obtain \"appropriate equitable\n\nrelief . . . to enforce . . . the terms of the plan.\"                Under the\n\nLTD Plan, if Cusson received an overpayment on her disability claim\n\nfrom any source, Liberty \"ha[d] the right to recovery of such\n\noverpayments from [Cusson] or [Cusson's] estate.\" Although Liberty\n\nterminated Cusson's LTD benefits before Cusson was awarded SSDI\n\nbenefits, the SSA awarded benefits retroactive to March 15, 2002.\n\nLiberty argues that because it paid STD and LTD benefits from this\n\ndate until December 8, 2004, the SSDI benefits Cusson received for\n\nthis period are an overpayment, and hence that § 1132(a)(3) allows\n\nit to sue to enforce the right to recover the overpayment.\n\n\n\ndenial context, these terms are interchangeable.               See Denmark III,\n566 F.3d at 7.\n\n                                       -32-\n\f          Cusson argues that Liberty's counterclaim is a legal\n\nclaim, rather than an equitable claim, and hence that it is not\n\npermitted under § 1132(a)(3).     Cusson relies on Great West Life &\n\nAnnuity Insurance Co. v. Knudson, a case involving a similar\n\noverpayment provision in an ERISA plan, in which the Supreme Court\n\nheld that the plan administrator could not use the overpayment\n\nprovision to recover the proceeds from the plan beneficiaries' tort\n\nsuit against a third party because the claim was a legal claim\n\nrather than an equitable claim.    534 U.S. 204 (2002).   However, the\n\ndistrict court, in allowing Liberty's claim, relied on Sereboff v.\n\nMid Atlantic Medical Services, Inc., in which the Court reached the\n\nopposite result and allowed a plan to recover for overpayment of\n\nmedical expenses when the claimant received money from a third\n\nparty in tort.     547 U.S. 356 (2006).\n\n          In Knudson, the funds recovered in the suit were not\n\nactually in the possession of the plan beneficiaries; rather, they\n\nhad been placed into a \"Special Needs Trust\" under California law.\n\n534 U.S. at 214.     Thus, the Court held that the plan's monetary\n\nclaim against the beneficiaries would effectively operate as \"the\n\nimposition of personal liability for the benefits that [the plan]\n\nconferred upon [the beneficiaries],\" which was a legal rather than\n\nequitable claim.    Id.   In contrast, in Sereboff, the beneficiaries\n\nhad deposited the proceeds from the suit into their personal\n\ninvestment account, and the plan specifically asserted a claim for\n\n\n                                  -33-\n\fsome portion of those funds.      547 U.S. at 360, 362-63.       Thus, the\n\nCourt held that the claim was a type of \"equitable restitution\"\n\nbecause it was for \"specifically identifiable funds that were\n\nwithin the possession and control of the Sereboffs.\" Id. at 362-63\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n           We find that Sereboff, rather than Knudson, controls in\n\nthis case.   Here, like in Sereboff, the LTD Plan targets specific\n\nfunds for recovery -- Cusson's LTD payments -- and identifies the\n\nspecific portion to which Liberty is entitled -- the amount of the\n\noverpayment while Cusson was receiving benefits under the LTD Plan.\n\nWe are persuaded by the Eighth Circuit's holding in a similar case\n\nthat a claim such as this is a claim for equitable relief.             See\n\nDillard's Inc. v. Liberty Life Assurance Co., 456 F.3d 894, 901\n\n(8th Cir. 2006) (finding that Liberty's claim was equitable when it\n\nsought \"a particular share of a specifically identified fund -- all\n\noverpayments   resulting   from    the   payment   of   social    security\n\nbenefits\"). Moreover, unlike in Knudson, the SSDI benefit was paid\n\nto Cusson rather than into a separate trust over which she has no\n\ncontrol.   It is true that, unlike the insurer in Sereboff, Liberty\n\nhas not identified a specific account in which the funds are kept\n\nor proven that they are still in Cusson's possession. However, the\n\nCourt in Sereboff noted \"'the familiar rul[e] of equity that a\n\ncontract to convey a specific object even before it is acquired\n\nwill make the contractor a trustee as soon as he gets a title to\n\n\n                                  -34-\n\fthe thing.'\"    547 U.S. at 363-64 (quoting Barnes v. Alexander, 232\n\nU.S. 117, 141 (1914)).         Here, the contract between Cusson and\n\nLiberty   put   Cusson   on   notice   that   she   would   be   required    to\n\nreimburse Liberty for an amount equal to what she might get from\n\nSocial Security.    We therefore find that Liberty's counterclaim is\n\nan equitable claim and is allowed under 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(3).\n\n            Cusson further argues that Liberty's claim is barred\n\nunder the Social Security Act, Title II, 47 U.S.C. §§ 401 et seq.\n\nThe Act provides, in relevant part:\n\n            The right of any person to any future payment\n            under this title shall not be transferable or\n            assignable, at law or in equity, and none of\n            the moneys paid or payable or rights existing\n            under   this  title   shall  be   subject  to\n            execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or\n            other legal process, or to the operation of\n            any bankruptcy or insolvency law.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 407(a).      The district court held that this section of\n\nthe Act only applies to future payments, and not to retroactive\n\npayments.    However, Cusson argues that the reference to \"moneys\n\npaid or payable\" indicates that the statute's protections apply to\n\nall payments, whether future payments or retroactive payments.\n\n            We agree with the district court that 42 U.S.C. § 407(a)\n\ndoes not bar Liberty's claim.           However, we disagree with the\n\ndistrict court's reasoning in reaching this conclusion.                     The\n\ndistrict court held that because the statute bars the transfer or\n\nassignment of the right to \"future payment,\" it did not bar claims\n\nfor retroactive payments.      However, the statute clearly goes on to\n\n                                   -35-\n\fsay that \"none of the moneys paid or payable . . . shall be subject\n\nto   execution,    levy,   attachment,      garnishment,   or   other   legal\n\nprocess.\"    Id.   Thus, the protections afforded by § 407(a) apply to\n\nretroactive SSDI payments.       See Philpott v. Essex County Welfare\n\nBd., 409 U.S. 413, 416 (1973) (holding that a state could not\n\nrecover    SSDI    benefits   paid   because   \"the   protection    afforded\n\nby § 407(a) is to 'moneys paid'\"); Hoult v. Hoult, 373 F.3d 47, 56\n\n(1st Cir. 2004) (\"There is no question that § 407(a) . . . applies\n\nto benefits after they have been distributed to beneficiaries.\").\n\n            Instead, we find that § 407(a) does not bar Liberty's\n\nclaim because Liberty is not attempting to recover Cusson's SSDI\n\nbenefits.    Rather, Liberty seeks to recover in equity from funds\n\nLiberty itself already paid under the LTD plan.                 Although the\n\namount in question happens to be the same as the amount of Cusson's\n\nretroactive SSDI payment, the funds Liberty is targeting do not\n\ncome from SSDI, and thus § 407(a) does not prohibit Liberty's\n\nclaim.    See Holmstrom v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 615 F. Supp. 2d 722,\n\n753 (N.D. Ill. 2009) (collecting cases in which courts have held\n\nthat § 407(a) does not bar recovery for overpayment).\n\n                              III. Conclusion\n\n            For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district\n\ncourt is affirmed.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -36-\n\f",

After Liberty terminated Cusson's long-term disability (\"LTD\") benefits, Cusson sued in the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts, arguing that the termination of her benefits was improper under the Employee Retirement and Income Security Act (\"ERISA\"), 29 U.S.C. §§ 1001-1431 (2006). The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants, and Cusson now appeals. After careful consideration, we affirm the district court's judgment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i><sup>[1]</sup></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. The Long-Term Disability Plan</h2>\n<p>Cusson was employed at FleetBoston as a Senior Facilities Planner. She was covered under both a short-term disability plan (\"STD Plan\") and the LTD Plan. Liberty is both the administrator of and payer of benefits under the LTD Plan. Under the terms of the insurance policy (\"the Policy\") for the LTD Plan, the definition of \"Disability\" or \"Disabled\" for LTD purposes varies over time with the duration of the disability. For the initial twenty-four-month period after a claimant switches into the LTD Plan from the STD Plan, a person is considered \"disabled\" if she is unable to perform \"all of the material and substantial duties of [her] own occupation.\" However, after twenty-four months, a person is considered \"disabled\" if she is \"unable to perform, with reasonable continuity, all of the material and substantial duties of [her] own or any other occupation for which [s]he is or becomes reasonably fitted by training, education, experience, and physical or mental capacity.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Cusson's Fibromyalgia Diagnosis and Initial LTD Benefits Award</h2>\n<p>In March 2002, Cusson was diagnosed with breast cancer. She began to receive benefits under the STD Plan in April 2002 because of the pain and fatigue caused by her chemotherapy. Cusson was notified on October 9, 2002 that she qualified for LTD benefits under the Policy. Liberty also informed Cusson that she was required to apply for Social Security Disability Income (\"SSDI\") benefits. Cusson's chemotherapy ended in October 2002. However, she continued to feel symptoms similar to what she felt during her cancer treatment, including dizziness, fatigue, headaches, and widespread body pain.</p>\n<p>In February 2003, Cusson's rheumatologist, Dr. James Figueroa (\"Figueroa\"), diagnosed her with fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia is characterized by \"chronic and frequently difficult to manage pain in muscles and soft tissues surrounding joints.\" <i>Rose v. Hartford Fin. Servs. Group,</i> 268 Fed.Appx. 444, 446 n. 4 (6th Cir.2008) (citing <i>Taber's Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary</i> 402 (19th ed. 2001)). A patient may be diagnosed with fibromyalgia if she has (1) a history of widespread pain for at least three months and (2) pain in at least eleven out of eighteen tender point sites upon digital palpation. <i>Id.</i> Symptoms of fibromyalgia can include stiffness, fatigue, and disturbed sleep. <i>See </i><i>Sarchet v. Chater,</i> 78 F.3d 305, 306 (7th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p>On March 28, 2003, at Liberty's request, Cusson completed an Activities Questionnaire, a document in which a claimant is asked to describe her day-to-day activities <span class=\"star-pagination\">*219</span> and her functional limitations. Cusson indicated that she was able to sit for approximately two hours, stand for fifteen to thirty minutes, and walk for thirty to forty-five minutes. She noted that these lengths of time were \"longer/shorter depending on the day and how I feel.\" She also reported memory and concentration problems, and indicated that she was never able to predict how she would feel from one day to the next.</p>\n<p>On August 21, 2003, at Liberty's request, Figueroa filled out a questionnaire regarding Cusson's condition. Figueroa was asked to describe \"specific restrictions and limitations ... preventing your patient from being able to work.\" Figueroa also submitted a Physical Capacities Form, on which he reported that Cusson could lift no more than ten pounds twice a day, could sit for four hours per day but needed to stand up every fifteen minutes, could stand for up to one hour but needed to sit every five to ten minutes, and could walk for an hour but needed to rest every few minutes. Figueroa concluded that Cusson could not work a full eight-hour day until her pain and fatigue subsided.</p>\n<p>On March 15, 2004, Liberty notified Cusson that beginning September 29, 2004, the definition of \"disabled\" under the Policy would change, after which Cusson would have to be unable to perform <i>all</i> of the material and substantial duties of <i>any</i> occupation for which she was qualified. On May 7, 2004, Figueroa, at Liberty's request, completed a Functional Capacities Form and a Restrictions Form. The Functional Capacities Form asked Figueroa to list, for various activities, whether Cusson had \"[n]o [r]estrictions,\" could perform the activity \"[f]requently (1/3 to 2/3 of the time),\" \"[o]ccasionally (up to 1/3 of the time),\" or was \"[u]nable to\" perform the activity. Figueroa indicated that Cusson was \"[u]nable to\" squat, bend, kneel, climb, push or pull objects, or lift any weight over ten pounds.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. 2004 Review and Termination of Cusson's LTD Benefits</h2>\n<p>On May 18, 2004, Liberty hired Omega Insurance Services, Inc. (\"Omega\") to conduct video surveillance of Cusson. Eleven days later, Liberty again told Cusson to apply for SSDI benefits, warning that if she did not, Liberty would reduce her disability benefit by the amount she was eligible to receive from the Social Security Administration (\"SSA\"). Liberty also informed Cusson that it would help her obtain SSDI benefits.</p>\n<p>Omega conducted surveillance of Cusson on June 9-12, 17, and 24, 2004. Omega videotaped Cusson when she was observed outside of her home, and it obtained fifty minutes and fifty-eight seconds of video over the course of these six days. The video footage that was obtained appeared to show Cusson engaged in normal activities. For example, on June 9, Cusson was observed walking her dog for approximately thirty minutes; according to the Omega report, Cusson walked \"in a smooth, fluid manner without exhibiting any external signs of impairment.\" Later that day she drove to a nearby Home Depot store and was seen exiting the store an hour later carrying a shopping bag. On June 24, Cusson was observed having lunch with a friend at a restaurant and then going to a Wal-Mart. Cusson was inside the Wal-Mart for almost one hour, after which she exited with a loaded shopping cart. She loaded the items from her cart, including what Omega's report described as a large bag of cat litter, into her car, and she was also observed bending at the waist to pick up items that had fallen on the ground.</p>\n<p>On July 20, 2004, Liberty told Cusson that if she did not provide proof of her SSA application by August 3, 2004, Liberty <span class=\"star-pagination\">*220</span> would immediately reduce her benefits by the estimated amount of the SSDI benefit. Liberty also instructed Omega to conduct a second round of surveillance. This surveillance occurred between July 26 and 28, during which time Cusson was seen on the surveillance tape once, on July 27, for a total of one minute and seven seconds.</p>\n<p>In August 2004, Liberty ordered a third round of video surveillance. Omega performed this surveillance on August 2, 9-10, 14, and 26. Cusson was seen leaving her home only on August 26. Cusson was observed bending fully at the waist to retrieve an item outside her front door. She was then seen driving to a local restaurant and eating lunch with another person, and was then seen driving to a dry cleaner's, a Wal-Mart, and other department stores. During the course of her errands, she was observed carrying various items into and out of stores and bending at the waist to retrieve items from or place items into her car.</p>\n<p>On September 15, 2004, Cusson completed another Activities Questionnaire from Liberty, in which she described her functional limitations, including pain, fatigue, memory loss, and inability to concentrate. Cusson reported that since her last Activities Questionnaire from March 28, 2003, she could not remember going to a mall because malls were \"just too big\"; instead, Cusson noted, she went \"mostly to small stores [with] easy access in + out.\" Cusson also reported that she had \"good\" days and \"bad\" days. She said that on a \"good\" day she would be able to perform activities such as running errands, visiting other people, and having lunch outside her home. However, she reported that on a \"bad\" day she would be unable to sleep because of her pain and would often be unable to get out of bed for several days.</p>\n<p>On October 13, 2004, Figueroa reported to Liberty that, during an eight-hour work day, Cusson could sit for less than two hours, stand for less than thirty minutes, and walk for fifteen minutes. Figueroa also noted that Cusson could not lift or carry more than ten pounds and could not work eight hours per day in any occupation. Two days later, Figueroa reported to Liberty that Cusson's \"limitations tend to vary with the severity of [her] symptoms.\"</p>\n<p>Upon receipt of Figueroa's reports, Liberty referred Cusson's file to Dr. Robert Millstein (\"Millstein\"), a full-time Liberty employee, for review. Millstein reviewed Cusson's claim and concluded that \"the video surveillance demonstrates functional capacity which exceeds that reported on the most recent activities questionnaire and confirms that the claimant retains the physical capacity to perform full-time work at a light level.\" Millstein noted a number of apparent inconsistencies between Cusson's reported limitations and the video surveillance. For example, Millstein noted that although Cusson reported fatigue, the surveillance showed that \"on consecutive days, [Cusson] is seen out of her house for long periods of time performing activities which would be best characterized as requiring light to medium physical capacity.\" Thus, Millstein concluded, \"the record does not support the presence of fatigue which would preclude full-time work.\" Millstein also noted that Cusson was seen going into large stores, such as Wal-Mart and Home Depot, even though she had previously reported that she did not go to malls because malls were too big. Millstein also noted that Cusson was seen bending at the waist and placing a large object, a bag of cat litter, in her car.</p>\n<p>Millstein's report contained inaccurate statements about the surveillance results. Millstein frequently confused sightings of Cusson <i>returning</i> home with sightings of Cusson <i>leaving</i> her home. Millstein also said that on certain days Cusson left her <span class=\"star-pagination\">*221</span> home and remained out of her home for long periods, when in fact the surveillance for those days clearly shows that Cusson returned to her home at various points throughout the day. As a result of these errors, Millstein's report overstates the amount of time Cusson spent outside of her home on certain days, sometimes by as much as a factor of three.</p>\n<p>In November 2004, Liberty ordered a fourth round of surveillance, this time conducted by MJM Investigations, Inc. (\"MJM\"). MJM observed Cusson on November 2-6 and 11, 2004. Cusson was seen outside of her home for a total of roughly half an hour over the course of the surveillance. On November 2, Cusson was observed exiting her house carrying various bags and leaving her home as the passenger in a car. On November 4 and 11, Cusson was briefly seen driving to various locations to run errands. Cusson was not seen outside of her home on November 3, 5, or 6.</p>\n<p>On November 29, 2004, Liberty conducted a Transferable Skills Analysis and Labor Market Survey (\"TSA\") of Cusson's claim, relying solely on Millstein's report. The analysis concluded that Cusson could perform her occupation as a Facilities Manager as well as other occupations, such as Construction Manager, Property/Real Estate Manager, and Civil Engineer.</p>\n<p>On December 8, 2004, Liberty sent Cusson a letter informing her that her benefits were being terminated. The letter discussed the video surveillance and Millstein's review of Cusson's file. The letter also noted the results of the TSA and informed Cusson that she was capable of performing her original job as a Facility Planner. In addition, the letter noted that Liberty had written to Figueroa requesting a response to Millstein's report and the video surveillance, but that Figueroa had not responded.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Cusson's Appeal and Further Tests</h2>\n<p>On June 1, 2005, Cusson notified Liberty that she was appealing its decision to terminate her benefits. Cusson submitted various documents, including her own sworn statement; affidavits from her friends, family, and former colleagues; and a chart comparing the surveillance reports with her own recollection of her activities on the days she was surveilled. Cusson's sworn statement and activity chart indicate that on some of the days she was seen outside of her home, she would \"hit a wall\" and return home \"crying in pain.\" However, Cusson's activity chart is completely silent as to what she was doing, or what symptoms she was experiencing, on many days when she was not observed outside of her home.</p>\n<p>Cusson also submitted medical reports from in-person examinations by Dr. Peter Schur (\"Schur\"), a rheumatologist, and Drs. Daniel Cohen (\"Cohen\") and Jean Matheson (\"Matheson\"), who specialize in sleep disorders. Schur's examination was paid for by Cusson's health insurer as part of her treatment. Schur's examination indicated that Cusson had limited motion in her shoulders, hips, and back; had \"fair muscle tone at best\"; and was painfully sensitive to touch. Schur concluded that Cusson was disabled \"at present,\" and recommended treatment options. Cohen and Matheson indicated that Cusson had trouble sleeping because of her pain, but they did not render an opinion as to disability.</p>\n<p>Cusson also submitted a report from Paul Blatchford, Ed. M. (\"Blatchford\"), a vocational rehabilitation expert, who conducted an in-person evaluation on February 15, 2005. Blatchford's report detailed Cusson's impaired performance on a variety of standardized vocational tests approved by the United States Department of Labor (\"DOL\"). The report noted that Cusson appeared exhausted and distracted <span class=\"star-pagination\">*222</span> throughout the entire proceeding. Blatchford noted that under DOL guidelines, the occupations for which Cusson was qualified required \"sedentary\" to \"light\" exertion levels. Blatchford concluded that Cusson's functional capacity precluded her from performing and sustaining any work-related activities. Blatchford also disputed Liberty's interpretation of the surveillance videos. He argued that the videos failed to address Cusson's cognitive limitations. He also noted that although the video showed that Cusson was capable of short periods of activity, a fact that she herself had reported, it did not show Cusson engaged in <i>sustained</i> activity that would be necessary for any kind of employment.</p>\n<p>On July 26, 2005, Liberty informed Cusson that it had referred her file for two peer reviews. Both reviews were paid for by Liberty. One review was conducted by Dr. Walter Longo (\"Longo\"), an oncologist, who determined that there was \"no objective data supporting ongoing impairment due to prior therapy\" for breast cancer, but that it was possible that Cusson could have limitations due to fibromyalgia. The other was conducted by Dr. Jeffrey Liebermann (\"Liebermann\"), a rheumatologist, who concluded that Cusson \"should be able to perform the duties of light or sedentary occupations\" despite her fibromyalgia, and that Cusson's impairments were \"entirely subjective.\" Liebermann also claimed to have spoken on the phone with Figueroa. Liebermann reported that during his conversation with Figueroa, Figueroa said that he had told Cusson that he no longer wished to be consulted about the disability aspects of her case. On August 11, 2005, Liebermann sent Figueroa a letter purporting to summarize their conversation and requesting that Figueroa review and make comments or corrections to the letter and fax it back to him. Figueroa did not sign the letter or return it.</p>\n<p>On September 7, 2005, Cusson underwent an examination by Dr. Mitchell Abramson (\"Abramson\"). Abramson reported that Cusson had \"multiple trigger points\" for pain and was unable to bend forward more than forty degrees due to back pain. Abramson concluded that Cusson \"appear[ed] to be disabled due to her medical illness.\" On September 9, 2005, Blatchford wrote an addendum to his February 15, 2005 report, stating that Liberty's interpretation of the surveillance reports was \"inaccurate, and contradicted by the videotapes themselves.\" Blatchford noted that the video of Cusson running errands was \"consistent with [Cusson's] ability to perform activities for limited periods of time,\" but that Cusson's need for frequent rest and her \"tendency to `fade' after engaging in any task for a sustained period of time\" showed that she \"lack[ed] the ability to engage in sustained work, whether sedentary or otherwise.\"</p>\n<p>Cusson submitted Abramson's report, Blatchford's addendum, and other documentation to Liberty on September 15, 2005. In response, Liberty conducted a second round of peer reviews. Both of these additional reviews were conducted by MLS National Medical Evaluations, Inc. (\"MLS\") and paid for by Liberty. The first review was conducted by Dr. Reynold Karr (\"Karr\"), a rheumatologist, who concluded that he did not \"identify any objective medical basis for impairment or need for physical restrictions based upon review of the accompanying medical record.\" The second MLS review was conducted by Dr. Matthew Kaufman (\"Kaufman\"), an oncologist. Kaufman indicated that, from his perspective as an oncologist, there was no \"identifiable or medically supported level of functional impairment that can be objectively verified.\" However, Kaufman noted that fibromyalgia fell outside his area of expertise, and conceded that Cusson \"may have a level of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*223</span> functional impairment due to ... fibromyalgia and/or psychological overlay.\"</p>\n<p>On November 1, 2005, Liberty upheld its decision to terminate Cusson's benefits. Liberty stated that \"based on the totality of clinical and objective medical documentation contained in Ms. Cusson's file, sedentary to light capacity has been established.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. Award of SSDI Benefits</h2>\n<p>On January 21, 2006, an Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") awarded Cusson SSDI benefits, with a disability date of March 15, 2002. In granting the benefits, the ALJ found that Cusson was \"unable to do sustained work activities in an ordinary work setting on a regular and continuing basis.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>F. District Court Proceedings</h2>\n<p>On December 7, 2005, Cusson filed suit against Liberty and the LTD Plan in the District of Massachusetts under ERISA, 29 U.S.C. § 1001 <i>et seq.</i> Cusson sought to recover her benefits pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B). Liberty answered and asserted a counterclaim seeking reimbursement for overpayment of benefits under the Policy as a result of Cusson having received SSDI benefits. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on all issues.</p>\n<p>Because the LTD Plan gave Liberty discretion to determine eligibility for benefits, the district court applied an abuse of discretion standard to Liberty's decision. Under this standard, Liberty's decision would be upheld if it was \"reasoned and supported by substantial evidence.\" <i>Gannon v. Metro. Life Ins. Co.,</i> 360 F.3d 211, 213 (1st Cir.2004). The district court recognized that Liberty had a structural conflict of interest, since it both evaluated benefit claims and paid the benefits. However, the district court, citing the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. v. Glenn,</i> held that even in the face of a conflict, the standard of review remained deferential, and that the conflict was \"one factor among many that a reviewing judge must take into account.\" ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 2343, 2351, 171 L.Ed.2d 299 (2008).</p>\n<p>Cusson made two main arguments in her district court case opposing the denial of benefits. First, she argued that Liberty and its reviewers improperly used and interpreted the surveillance videos. Second, she argued that Liberty's review process was flawed, and that these flaws showed that Liberty's decision was an abuse of discretion. The district court held that Liberty's decision to terminate her benefits was not an abuse of discretion. With respect to the surveillance results, the court held that, although the surveillance supported the inference that Cusson could not perform sustained activity, the surveillance also supported the inference that \"Cusson and Dr. Figueroa had significantly overstated [Cusson's] functional limitations.\" The court also rejected Cusson's various claims of procedural unfairness in Liberty's review process. In addition to upholding Liberty's decision to terminate Cusson's benefits, the court also granted summary judgment to Liberty on its counterclaim.</p>\n<p>Cusson now appeals the district court's decision.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Applicable Law and Standard of Review</h2>\n<p>We review a district court's grant of summary judgment <i>de novo. </i><i>Thompson v. Coca-Cola Co.,</i> 522 F.3d 168, 175 (1st Cir.2008). Normally, when we review a district court's grant of summary judgment, \"[w]e will reverse only if, after reviewing the facts and making all inferences in favor of the non-moving party [here, Cusson], the evidence on record is sufficiently <span class=\"star-pagination\">*224</span> open-ended to permit a rational factfinder to resolve the issue in favor of either side.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted). However, in an ERISA benefit-denial context, \"the district court sits more as an appellate tribunal than as a trial court.\" <i>Leahy v. Raytheon Co.,</i> 315 F.3d 11, 18 (1st Cir.2002). In such cases, \"summary judgment is simply a vehicle for deciding the issue,\" and, consequently, \"the non-moving party is not entitled to the usual inferences in its favor.\" <i>Orndorf v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co.,</i> 404 F.3d 510, 517 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>When an ERISA plan gives the administrator the discretion to determine eligibility for benefits (as in this case), a reviewing court must uphold that decision unless it is \"arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.\" <i>Gannon,</i> 360 F.3d at 213 (citing <i>Vlass v. Raytheon Employees Disability Trust,</i> 244 F.3d 27, 30 (1st Cir. 2001)). However, Cusson argues that the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Glenn</i> changed the standard of review from an abuse of discretion standard to a \"combination of factors\" standard in cases where, as here, there is a structural conflict of interest. We disagree.</p>\n<p>In deciding what effect a conflict would have on the standard of review, the Supreme Court in <i>Glenn</i> \"elucidate[d] what [the] Court said in <i>Firestone,</i> namely, that a conflict should `be weighed as a factor in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion.'\" <i>Glenn,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 2350 (quoting <i>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch,</i> 489 U.S. 101, 115, 109 S.Ct. 948, 103 L.Ed.2d 80 (1989)). However, the Court went on to say, \"We do not believe that <i>Firestone</i>'s statement implies a change in the <i>standard</i> of review, say, from deferential to <i>de novo</i> review.\" <i>Id.</i> Rather, the Court said that \"<i>Firestone</i> means what the word `factor' implies, namely, that when judges review the lawfulness of benefit denials, they will often take account of several different considerations of which a conflict of interest is one.\" <i>Id.</i> at 2351.</p>\n<p>Because <i>Glenn</i> did not alter the standard of review, and because our review of the lower court's grant of summary judgment is <i>de novo,</i> we will review Liberty's decision to deny Cusson's benefits under the same abuse of discretion standard used by the district court. <i>See </i><i>Denmark v. Liberty Life Assurance Co.</i> (<i>Denmark III</i>), 566 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.2009) (where the plan administrator has discretion, \"<i>Glenn</i>'s baseline principle, consistent with this circuit's prior precedents, [is] that judicial review of such a benefit-denial decision is for abuse of discretion\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Appropriate Weight Given to the Conflict of Interest</h2>\n<p>Although the presence of a conflict of interest does not change the standard of review in this case, the conflict itself can, under certain circumstances, be accorded extra weight in the court's analysis. In <i>Glenn,</i> the Supreme Court held that \"[t]he conflict of interest at issue ... should prove more important (perhaps of great importance) where circumstances suggest a higher likelihood that it affected the benefits decision, including, but not limited to, cases where an insurance company administrator has a history of biased claims administration.\" 128 S.Ct. at 2351. On the other hand, the conflict \"should prove less important (perhaps to the vanishing point) where the administrator has taken active steps to reduce potential bias and to promote accuracy.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>We have interpreted this language from <i>Glenn</i> to mean that \"courts are duty-bound to inquire into what steps a plan administrator has taken to insulate the decisionmaking process against the potentially pernicious effects of structural conflicts.\" <i>Denmark III,</i> 566 F.3d at 9. Although <span class=\"star-pagination\">*225</span> Cusson argues that it is Liberty's burden to show that the conflict did not affect its decision, the Supreme Court explicitly declined to specify a burden-of-proof rule for determining the weight that a conflict should be given. <i>See Glenn,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 2351 (\"Neither do we believe it necessary or desirable for courts to create special burden-of-proof rules, or other special procedural or evidentiary rules, focused narrowly upon the evaluator/payer conflict.\"). We therefore apply the same burden of proof to the conflict issue that we do to any other aspect of an ERISA claim for improper denial of benefits; hence, Cusson bears the burden of showing that the conflict influenced Liberty's decision. <i>See </i><i>Terry v. Bayer Corp.,</i> 145 F.3d 28, 34 (1st Cir.1998) (\"Here, [claimant] bears the burden of making a showing sufficient to establish a violation of ERISA, namely, that the benefit termination was unreasonable.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>Cusson has not raised (and, thus, the parties have not briefed) the issue of the adequacy of Liberty's internal procedures to insulate the review process from the conflict. Instead, Cusson argues that certain alleged flaws in the way the review was conducted prove that Liberty's decision was influenced by its conflict. As discussed below, we do not find that these alleged flaws show that Liberty was improperly influenced by its conflict.</p>\n<p>Firstly, Cusson argues that Liberty relied exclusively on Millstein's report, including his inaccurate statements about the surveillance results, rather than relying on the totality of the record. Cusson correctly points out that in its initial denial letter, Liberty quoted language that it <i>claimed</i> was from the surveillance reports, but that was actually from Millstein's interpretation of the surveillance. Liberty also claimed that it relied on its TSA, but the record indicates that the TSA was based solely on Millstein's report.</p>\n<p>We find nothing wrong with the degree of Liberty's reliance on Millstein's report. Although the denial letter from Liberty quoted Millstein's summary of the surveillance data, and not the surveillance reports themselves, the record also indicates that Liberty's case manager did review the tapes. Moreover, as the district court noted, even though Millstein made inaccurate statements about the surveillance data in his report, Millstein's main substantive point about the surveillance that it showed Cusson engaged in activities that she claimed she could not dowas accurate. Many of the activities that Cusson was observed doing were activities that she specifically reported being unable to do, such as bending at the waist and lifting objects heavier than ten pounds. Moreover, when Cusson was seen outside, she did not appear to show any signs of fatigue or impaired physical capabilities. While this is by no means ironclad proof of ability to work, it is evidence that Liberty was entitled to consider. We read Liberty's decision as being based not simply on the <i>amount</i> of activity observed, but also on the <i>nature</i> of the activity observed, and Millstein's report contained no errors with respect to the latter.</p>\n<p>Next, Cusson argues that Liberty improperly relied on Liebermann's hearsay testimony about his conversation with Figueroa. Liebermann claimed that he spoke with Figueroa and that Figueroa \"understood that there was a significant discrepancy between the claimant's reported functionality and what was seen on the surveillance tapes.\" Liebermann further claimed that Figueroa indicated that he had told Cusson that he no longer wished to be involved in the disability aspect of her case. However, Cusson noted that Figueroa never responded to Liebermann's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*226</span> request to sign off on Liebermann's account of their conversation. Thus, Cusson argues, Liebermann's entire account of the conversation is hearsay that neither Liberty nor the district court should have relied on in its decision.</p>\n<p>However, \"[a] plan administrator is not a court of law and is not bound by the rules of evidence.\" <i>Speciale v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Ass'n,</i> 538 F.3d 615, 622 n. 4 (7th Cir.2008). Because Figueroa never responded to Liebermann's request to comment on his account of the conversation, it was not an abuse of discretion for Liberty to assume that Liebermann's account of the conversation was accurate. Since Cusson never presented Liberty with any evidence to challenge directly Liebermann's account of the conversation, we find nothing inappropriate about Liberty's reliance on that account.</p>\n<p>Cusson next argues that Liberty's reviewing physicians were biased against patients with fibromyalgia. Although Liebermann's report mentions some of the evidence submitted by Cusson, Cusson alleges that Liebermann reached his conclusion about her ability to work without actually analyzing the medical evidence in her file. In his report, Liebermann stated: \"This claimant has a diagnosis of [f]ibromyalgia. As such, she should be able to perform the duties of light or sedentary occupations.\" Cusson argues that this statement indicates that Liebermann had a preconceived notion that fibromyalgia could <i>never</i> be a disabling diagnosis, and thus did not fairly consider her file. Similarly, Millstein cited a 1986 study of fibromyalgia patients that indicated that most of them were eventually able to return to work. Cusson points out that the Seventh Circuit has held that \"[t]he fact that the majority of individuals suffering from fibromyalgia can work is the weakest possible evidence that [an individual claimant] can.\" <i>Hawkins v. First Union Corp. Long Term Disability Plan,</i> 326 F.3d 914, 919 (7th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p>If Liebermann or Millstein had said that fibromyalgia patients are never disabled, those statements would be clearly wrong. However, although Liebermann and Millstein made statements that might be interpreted as improper generalizations, it does not necessarily follow that they relied on such generalizations when issuing their reports. Had either doctor concluded that Cusson was not disabled because fibromyalgia is never or not always disabling, that conclusion would have been inappropriate. However, both doctors' reports indicate that they reviewed the surveillance footage and based their conclusions on the apparent contradiction between the footage and Cusson's reported impairments.</p>\n<p>Cusson also argues that Liberty's reliance on paper file reviews instead of direct medical examinations shows that it was influenced by its conflict. Cusson acknowledges that this court has found \"a nonexamining physician's review of a claimant's file [to be] ... reliable medical evidence.\" <i>Gannon,</i> 360 F.3d at 214. However, Cusson argues that the particular circumstances of this case warrant a preference for reports by examining physicians. She notes that fibromyalgia is a disease that can only be diagnosed by a clinical examination of a patient based on subjective reports of pain. Certain circuits have held that in such cases some deference to examining physicians is appropriate. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Kalish v. Liberty Life Assurance Co.,</i> 419 F.3d 501, 509-10 (6th Cir.2005); <i>Hawkins,</i> 326 F.3d at 919 (the \"gravest problem\" with the opinion offered by an ERISA plan administrator's paper-reviewing doctor was his refusal to accept \"subjective symptoms\" of pain and fatigue known to be associated with fibromyalgia). Moreover, Cusson notes that Liberty's reviewing physicians were paid for their reports <span class=\"star-pagination\">*227</span> by Liberty, whereas Cusson's treating physicians were paid by her health insurance company. The Supreme Court has recognized that \"physicians repeatedly retained by benefits plans may have an incentive to make a finding of `not disabled' in order to save their employers money and to preserve their own consulting arrangements.\" <i>Black &amp; Decker Disability Plan v. Nord,</i> 538 U.S. 822, 832, 123 S.Ct. 1965, 155 L.Ed.2d 1034 (2003) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>We see no reason why the nonexamining physicians' reports in this case are unreliable. We recognize that fibromyalgia is a disease that is diagnosed primarily based on a patient's self-reported pain symptoms. However, Liberty's reviewers did not question the <i>diagnosis</i> of fibromyalgia; instead, they questioned the <i>effect</i> of the disease on Cusson's ability to work. \"[T]his court draws a distinction between requiring objective evidence of the diagnosis, which is impermissible for a condition such as fibromyalgia that does not lend itself to objective verification, and requiring objective evidence that the plaintiff is unable to work, which is allowed.\" <i>Denmark v. Liberty Life Assurance Co.</i> (<i>Denmark II</i>), 481 F.3d 16, 37 (1st Cir.2007), <i>vacated </i><i>on other grounds,</i> 566 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.2009). Because it is permissible to require documented, objective evidence of disability, it was not inappropriate for Liberty's reviewers to rely on the lack of such documented evidence, or on the footage that contradicted Cusson's reports of limitations, in making their recommendations. The fact that Liberty's reviewers were paid for their reports does not, by itself, lead us to believe that Liberty was influenced by its conflict, since Cusson has provided no evidence that Liberty retained its reviewers specifically because they have a record of denying claims.</p>\n<p>Next, Cusson claims that Liberty failed to provide her complete medical record to its reviewers. Liberty's internal files indicated that \"[a]ll medical records\" had been sent to its reviewers. However, the reviewers did not list certain documents that were favorable to Cusson such as various medical records, her activity log, and portions of the surveillance reports that showed no activityin their reports. The district court held that under our holding in <i>Tsoulas v. Liberty Life Assurance Co.,</i> it would be improper for the court automatically to assume that unless the medical report lists each item the examiner reviewed, he or she did not review it. <i>See</i> 454 F.3d 69, 77 (1st Cir.2006). However, Cusson argues that the district court's reliance on <i>Tsoulas</i> was incorrect. Cusson points out that in <i>Tsoulas,</i> the plaintiff's claim that Liberty failed to provide certain documents to the reviewers was obviously incorrect because some of the documents that the plaintiff said were missing were explicitly listed in those same reviewers' reports. <i>Id.</i> In contrast, the documents that Cusson claims were not provided are not listed in any of Liberty's reviewers' reports.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Cusson's attempt to distinguish <i>Tsoulas</i> from this case fails. Contrary to Cusson's position, the reviewing physician reports in <i>Tsoulas</i> did <i>not</i> explicitly mention certain reports that the claimant said were missing; rather, the district court <i>inferred</i> that those documents were provided because the physicians' reports listed <i>some,</i> but not <i>all,</i> of the documents. <i>See id.</i> Likewise, in this case, each of the reviewing physicians' reports list at least some of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*228</span> supplementary material provided by Cusson. Hence, in this case, as in <i>Tsoulas,</i> we find no reason to believe that Liberty did not supply the entire record.</p>\n<p>Finally, Cusson argues that Liberty's failure to credit the SSA's award of disability benefits shows that Liberty was influenced by its conflict. Cusson notes that Liberty insisted that she apply for SSDI benefits, which she was awarded, but now seeks to benefit financially from that award by claiming the right to reimbursement for overpayment. Cusson notes that in <i>Glenn,</i> the Supreme Court treated this behavior as evidence that a conflict influenced the plan administrator's judgment. In <i>Glenn,</i> the plan administrator encouraged the claimant to apply for SSDI benefits and then recovered the bulk of those benefits by virtue of the reimbursement provision. The administrator then turned around and denied benefits for the same disability that it had encouraged the claimant to plead to the SSA. The Court held:</p>\n<blockquote>This course of events was not only an important factor in its own right (because it suggested procedural unreasonableness), but also would have justified the court in giving more weight to the conflict (because MetLife's seemingly inconsistent positions were both financially advantageous).</blockquote>\n<p><i>Glenn,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 2352.</p>\n<p>We find nothing suspicious about Liberty's failure to credit Cusson's successful application for SSDI benefits, because Cusson was not awarded SSDI benefits until after Liberty denied her LTD benefits. We have held that when reviewing an insurer's decision to deny benefits, we determine whether \"the insurer's eligibility determination was unreasonable in light of the information available to it when it made its decision.\" <i>Denmark II,</i> 481 F.3d at 39 (internal quotation mark omitted). Because the SSA's award of benefits had not yet occurred when Liberty made its decision, that fact could not have been known to Liberty.</p>\n<p>In summary, as discussed above, we do not find that Liberty's decision was improperly influenced by its structural conflict of interest. We therefore do not accord any special weight to the conflict in our analysis of whether Liberty's decision was proper, but rather consider it along with all of the factors present in this case to determine if Liberty's ultimate conclusion regarding Cusson's benefits was \"reasoned and supported by substantial evidence.\" <i>Gannon,</i> 360 F.3d at 213. We turn to this question below.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Whether Liberty's Decision Was an Abuse of Discretion</h2>\n<p>Cusson argues that the factors discussed in Section II(B), <i>supra,</i> which she claims show that Liberty was influenced by its conflict, also show that Liberty's ultimate decision was an abuse of discretion. For the same reasons we articulated above, we do not believe that these factors prove that Liberty's decision was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p>Cusson further argues that, contrary to the conclusions of Liberty and its reviewers, the surveillance video does not actually contradict any of her self-reported disabilities. Cusson never claimed that she was <i>entirely</i> incapable of performing normally; rather, she only claimed that she was unable to function normally <i>most of the time.</i> Thus, Cusson argues, given how infrequently she was seen outside of her home during the course of the surveillance, the surveillance is consistent with her claim of disability, and it was an abuse of discretion for Liberty to use it as evidence against her claim. Cusson notes that the surveillance video represents a mere two hour snapshot from twenty days of her life <span class=\"star-pagination\">*229</span> over the course of four months.<sup>[3]</sup> Cusson cites a number of cases in which courts have held that it was an abuse of discretion to rely on such limited surveillance data. <i>See, e.g., Soron v. Liberty Life Assurance Co.,</i> 2005 WL 1173076, at *11 (N.D.N.Y. May 2, 2005) (surveillance cannot be used to discount plaintiff's self-reported symptoms where \"it shows her performing isolated activities for brief periods of time with no revelation of consequences\"); <i>Osbun v. Auburn Foundry, Inc.,</i> 293 F.Supp.2d 863, 870 (N.D.Ind. 2003) (1.5 hours of surveillance video over two days fell short of demonstrating that plaintiff was capable of sustaining a job); <i>Cross v. Metro. Life Ins. Co.,</i> 292 Fed. Appx. 888, 892 (11th Cir.2008) (five days of surveillance resulting in two hours of video provided a \"mere snapshot\" of plaintiff's activities and failed to take into account impact of those activities on plaintiff).</p>\n<p>We conclude that it was reasonable to use the surveillance as evidence against Cusson's claim of disability. We have permitted ERISA plan administrators to use this type of sporadic evidence in the past. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Denmark II,</i> 481 F.3d at 38 (it was not arbitrary and capricious for Liberty to consider reports and photographs from four days of surveillance that showed claimant outside only for short periods of time on two of the four days); <i>Tsoulas,</i> 454 F.3d at 79 (no abuse of discretion where Liberty considered surveillance evidence consisting of four hours per day for three days even though it only represented a \"smallimpliedly non-representativefraction of each day\"). More importantly, although the limited amount of time she was seen outside her home is a factor that weighs in Cusson's favor, Liberty was certainly entitled to take notice of the fact that the video shows Cusson doing particular activities that she claimed she could not do. For example, she is seen going into large stores on two separate occasions, despite having claimed that she avoided malls because they were too big and preferred small stores. While we of course recognize that a Home Depot or a Wal-Mart is not the same thing as a mall, we cannot say that it was an abuse of discretion for Liberty and its reviewers to conclude that Cusson's apparent ability to navigate very large stores contradicted her claim that her illness required her to frequent small stores. The surveillance also shows Cusson bending, kneeling, picking up large objects such as a bag of cat litter, and pushing a loaded cart, despite the fact that the Functional Capacities Form completed by Figueroa on May 7, 2004 indicated that Cusson was physically unable to perform these activities.</p>\n<p>Because we find that Liberty was entitled to credit the surveillance, we are left to determine whether Liberty's ultimate conclusion was supported by the totality of the evidence. We find that it was. Cusson argues that Liberty failed to consider her objective evidence of disability. However, the record reflects that Liberty reached its decision not because it failed to consider the evidence in Cusson's favor, but because it determined that the surveillance results undermined the credibility of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*230</span> important portions of that evidence. Because we review Liberty's decision under an abuse of discretion standard, we must uphold it if we find that it was \"reasoned and supported by substantial evidence in the record.\"<sup>[4]</sup><i>Vlass,</i> 244 F.3d at 30 (internal quotation marks omitted). \"Evidence is substantial when it is reasonably sufficient to support a conclusion. Evidence contrary to an administrator's decision does not make the decision unreasonable, provided substantial evidence supports the decision.\" <i>Wright v. R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Co. Group Benefits Plan,</i> 402 F.3d 67, 74 (1st Cir.2005). Because we cannot say that the evidence in this case was insufficient to support Liberty's conclusion, we affirm Liberty's decision to terminate Cusson's benefits.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Whether Liberty's Counterclaim Is Allowed</h2>\n<p>Liberty asserted a counterclaim to recover Cusson's SSDI benefits under 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(3), which states that a plan fiduciary can bring a civil action to obtain \"appropriate equitable relief ... to enforce ... the terms of the plan.\" Under the LTD Plan, if Cusson received an overpayment on her disability claim from any source, Liberty \"ha[d] the right to recovery of such overpayments from [Cusson] or [Cusson's] estate.\" Although Liberty terminated Cusson's LTD benefits before Cusson was awarded SSDI benefits, the SSA awarded benefits retroactive to March 15, 2002. Liberty argues that because it paid STD and LTD benefits from this date until December 8, 2004, the SSDI benefits Cusson received for this period are an overpayment, and hence that § 1132(a)(3) allows it to sue to enforce the right to recover the overpayment.</p>\n<p>Cusson argues that Liberty's counterclaim is a legal claim, rather than an equitable claim, and hence that it is not permitted under § 1132(a)(3). Cusson relies on <i>Great-West Life &amp; Annuity Insurance Co. v. Knudson,</i> a case involving a similar overpayment provision in an ERISA plan, in which the Supreme Court held that the plan administrator could not use the overpayment provision to recover the proceeds from the plan beneficiaries' tort suit against a third party because the claim was a legal claim rather than an equitable claim. 534 U.S. 204, 122 S.Ct. 708, 151 L.Ed.2d 635 (2002). However, the district court, in allowing Liberty's claim, relied on <i>Sereboff v. Mid Atlantic Medical Services, Inc.,</i> in which the Court reached the opposite result and allowed a plan to recover for overpayment of medical expenses when the claimant received money from a third party in tort. 547 U.S. 356, 126 S.Ct. 1869, 164 L.Ed.2d 612 (2006).</p>\n<p>In <i>Knudson,</i> the funds recovered in the suit were not actually in the possession of the plan beneficiaries; rather, they had been placed into a \"Special Needs Trust\" under California law. 534 U.S. at 214, 122 S.Ct. 708. Thus, the Court held that the plan's monetary claim against the beneficiaries would effectively operate as \"the imposition of personal liability for the benefits that [the plan] conferred upon [the beneficiaries],\" which was a legal rather than equitable claim. <i>Id.</i> In contrast, in <i>Sereboff,</i> the beneficiaries had deposited the proceeds from the suit into their personal investment account, and the plan specifically asserted a claim for some portion of those funds. 547 U.S. at 360, 362-63, 126 S.Ct. 1869. Thus, the Court held that the claim was a type of \"equitable <span class=\"star-pagination\">*231</span> restitution\" because it was for \"specifically identifiable funds that were within the possession and control of the Sereboffs.\" <i>Id.</i> at 362-63, 126 S.Ct. 1869 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>We find that <i>Sereboff,</i> rather than <i>Knudson,</i> controls in this case. Here, like in <i>Sereboff,</i> the LTD Plan targets specific funds for recoveryCusson's LTD paymentsand identifies the specific portion to which Liberty is entitledthe amount of the overpayment while Cusson was receiving benefits under the LTD Plan. We are persuaded by the Eighth Circuit's holding in a similar case that a claim such as this is a claim for equitable relief. <i>See </i><i>Dillard's Inc. v. Liberty Life Assurance Co.,</i> 456 F.3d 894, 901 (8th Cir.2006) (finding that Liberty's claim was equitable when it sought \"a particular share of a specifically identified fund-all overpayments resulting from the payment of social security benefits\"). Moreover, unlike in <i>Knudson,</i> the SSDI benefit was paid to Cusson rather than into a separate trust over which she has no control. It is true that, unlike the insurer in <i>Sereboff,</i> Liberty has not identified a specific account in which the funds are kept or proven that they are still in Cusson's possession. However, the Court in <i>Sereboff</i> noted \"`the familiar rul[e] of equity that a contract to convey a specific object even before it is acquired will make the contractor a trustee as soon as he gets a title to the thing.'\" 547 U.S. at 363-64, 126 S.Ct. 1869 (quoting <i>Barnes v. Alexander,</i> 232 U.S. 117, 34 S.Ct. 276, 58 L.Ed. 530 (1914)). Here, the contract between Cusson and Liberty put Cusson on notice that she would be required to reimburse Liberty for an amount equal to what she might get from Social Security. We therefore find that Liberty's counterclaim is an equitable claim and is allowed under 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(3).</p>\n<p>Cusson further argues that Liberty's claim is barred under the Social Security Act, Title II, 47 U.S.C. §§ 401 <i>et seq.</i> The Act provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote>The right of any person to any future payment under this title shall not be transferable or assignable, at law or in equity, and none of the moneys paid or payable or rights existing under this title shall be subject to execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process, or to the operation of any bankruptcy or insolvency law.</blockquote>\n<p>42 U.S.C. § 407(a). The district court held that this section of the Act only applies to future payments, and not to retroactive payments. However, Cusson argues that the reference to \"moneys paid or payable\" indicates that the statute's protections apply to all payments, whether future payments or retroactive payments.</p>\n<p>We agree with the district court that 42 U.S.C. § 407(a) does not bar Liberty's claim. However, we disagree with the district court's reasoning in reaching this conclusion. The district court held that because the statute bars the transfer or assignment of the right to \"future payment,\" it did not bar claims for retroactive payments. However, the statute clearly goes on to say that \"none of the moneys <i>paid</i> or payable ... shall be subject to execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process.\" <i>Id.</i> Thus, the protections afforded by § 407(a) apply to retroactive SSDI payments. <i>See </i><i>Philpott v. Essex County Welfare Bd.,</i> 409 U.S. 413, 416, 93 S.Ct. 590, 34 L.Ed.2d 608 (1973) (holding that a state could not recover SSDI benefits paid because \"the protection afforded by § 407(a) is to `moneys paid'\"); <i>Hoult v. Hoult,</i> 373 F.3d 47, 56 (1st Cir.2004) (\"There is no question that § 407(a) ... applies to benefits after they have been distributed to beneficiaries.\").</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*232</span> Instead, we find that § 407(a) does not bar Liberty's claim because Liberty is not attempting to recover Cusson's SSDI benefits. Rather, Liberty seeks to recover in equity from funds Liberty itself already paid under the LTD plan. Although the amount in question happens to be the same as the amount of Cusson's retroactive SSDI payment, the funds Liberty is targeting do not come from SSDI, and thus § 407(a) does not prohibit Liberty's claim. <i>See </i><i>Holmstrom v. Metro. Life Ins. Co.,</i> 615 F.Supp.2d 722, 753 (N.D.Ill. 2009) (collecting cases in which courts have held that § 407(a) does not bar recovery for overpayment).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  For additional background, see the decision below. <i>Cusson v. Liberty Life Assurance Co.,</i> No. 78-3386, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 77084, 2008 WL 4457862 (D.Mass. Sep. 30, 2008).</p>\n<p>[2]  Cusson also argues that, in the wake of <i>Glenn,</i> the district court was wrong to place the burden of proof on her to show that the records were not provided. However, as we noted above, the Supreme Court <i>explicitly</i> chose <i>not</i> to impose any new burden-of-proof rules with respect to conflicts.</p>\n<p>[3]  Cusson argued to the district court that Liberty's internal training manuals regarding video surveillance should have been admitted to the record. The district court denied this request because Cusson did not demonstrate a \"very good reason\" for the inclusion of the manuals. <i>See </i><i>Liston v. Unum Corp. Officer Severance Plan,</i> 330 F.3d 19, 23 (1st Cir. 2003). Cusson challenges this decision on appeal. However, Cusson does not clearly explain why these documents would assist this court in determining whether Liberty's decision was an abuse of discretion. Because we do not see why these documents would be relevant to this case, we do not reach the issue of whether the district court properly excluded them.</p>\n<p>[4]  In our prior ERISA cases, we have variously described the standard of review, applicable when an ERISA plan grants the plan administrator the discretion to determine eligibility for benefits, as review for \"abuse of discretion,\" \"arbitrariness and capriciousness,\" and \"substantial evidence.\" In the ERISA benefit-denial context, these terms are interchangeable. <i>See </i><i>Denmark III,</i> 566 F.3d at 7.</p>\n\n</div>",

After Liberty terminated Cusson's long-term disability (\"LTD\") benefits, Cusson sued in the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts, arguing that the termination of her benefits was improper under the Employee Retirement and Income Security Act (\"ERISA\"), 29 U.S.C. §§ 1001-1431 (2006). The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants, and Cusson now appeals. After careful consideration, we affirm the district court's judgment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i><sup>[1]</sup></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. The Long-Term Disability Plan</h2>\n<p>Cusson was employed at FleetBoston as a Senior Facilities Planner. She was covered under both a short-term disability plan (\"STD Plan\") and the LTD Plan. Liberty is both the administrator of and payer of benefits under the LTD Plan. Under the terms of the insurance policy (\"the Policy\") for the LTD Plan, the definition of \"Disability\" or \"Disabled\" for LTD purposes varies over time with the duration of the disability. For the initial twenty-four-month period after a claimant switches into the LTD Plan from the STD Plan, a person is considered \"disabled\" if she is unable to perform \"all of the material and substantial duties of [her] own occupation.\" However, after twenty-four months, a person is considered \"disabled\" if she is \"unable to perform, with reasonable continuity, all of the material and substantial duties of [her] own or any other occupation for which [s]he is or becomes reasonably fitted by training, education, experience, and physical or mental capacity.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Cusson's Fibromyalgia Diagnosis and Initial LTD Benefits Award</h2>\n<p>In March 2002, Cusson was diagnosed with breast cancer. She began to receive benefits under the STD Plan in April 2002 because of the pain and fatigue caused by her chemotherapy. Cusson was notified on October 9, 2002 that she qualified for LTD benefits under the Policy. Liberty also informed Cusson that she was required to apply for Social Security Disability Income (\"SSDI\") benefits. Cusson's chemotherapy ended in October 2002. However, she continued to feel symptoms similar to what she felt during her cancer treatment, including dizziness, fatigue, headaches, and widespread body pain.</p>\n<p>In February 2003, Cusson's rheumatologist, Dr. James Figueroa (\"Figueroa\"), diagnosed her with fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia is characterized by \"chronic and frequently difficult to manage pain in muscles and soft tissues surrounding joints.\" <i>Rose v. Hartford Fin. Servs. Group,</i> 268 Fed.Appx. 444, 446 n. 4 (6th Cir.2008) (citing <i>Taber's Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary</i> 402 (19th ed. 2001)). A patient may be diagnosed with fibromyalgia if she has (1) a history of widespread pain for at least three months and (2) pain in at least eleven out of eighteen tender point sites upon digital palpation. <i>Id.</i> Symptoms of fibromyalgia can include stiffness, fatigue, and disturbed sleep. <i>See </i><i>Sarchet v. Chater,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"714168\"><a href=\"/opinion/714168/50-socsecrepser-323-unemplinsrep-cch-p-15128b-marlin-sarchet-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">305</span></a></span>, 306 (7th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p>On March 28, 2003, at Liberty's request, Cusson completed an Activities Questionnaire, a document in which a claimant is asked to describe her day-to-day activities <span class=\"star-pagination\">*219</span> and her functional limitations. Cusson indicated that she was able to sit for approximately two hours, stand for fifteen to thirty minutes, and walk for thirty to forty-five minutes. She noted that these lengths of time were \"longer/shorter depending on the day and how I feel.\" She also reported memory and concentration problems, and indicated that she was never able to predict how she would feel from one day to the next.</p>\n<p>On August 21, 2003, at Liberty's request, Figueroa filled out a questionnaire regarding Cusson's condition. Figueroa was asked to describe \"specific restrictions and limitations ... preventing your patient from being able to work.\" Figueroa also submitted a Physical Capacities Form, on which he reported that Cusson could lift no more than ten pounds twice a day, could sit for four hours per day but needed to stand up every fifteen minutes, could stand for up to one hour but needed to sit every five to ten minutes, and could walk for an hour but needed to rest every few minutes. Figueroa concluded that Cusson could not work a full eight-hour day until her pain and fatigue subsided.</p>\n<p>On March 15, 2004, Liberty notified Cusson that beginning September 29, 2004, the definition of \"disabled\" under the Policy would change, after which Cusson would have to be unable to perform <i>all</i> of the material and substantial duties of <i>any</i> occupation for which she was qualified. On May 7, 2004, Figueroa, at Liberty's request, completed a Functional Capacities Form and a Restrictions Form. The Functional Capacities Form asked Figueroa to list, for various activities, whether Cusson had \"[n]o [r]estrictions,\" could perform the activity \"[f]requently (1/3 to 2/3 of the time),\" \"[o]ccasionally (up to 1/3 of the time),\" or was \"[u]nable to\" perform the activity. Figueroa indicated that Cusson was \"[u]nable to\" squat, bend, kneel, climb, push or pull objects, or lift any weight over ten pounds.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. 2004 Review and Termination of Cusson's LTD Benefits</h2>\n<p>On May 18, 2004, Liberty hired Omega Insurance Services, Inc. (\"Omega\") to conduct video surveillance of Cusson. Eleven days later, Liberty again told Cusson to apply for SSDI benefits, warning that if she did not, Liberty would reduce her disability benefit by the amount she was eligible to receive from the Social Security Administration (\"SSA\"). Liberty also informed Cusson that it would help her obtain SSDI benefits.</p>\n<p>Omega conducted surveillance of Cusson on June 9-12, 17, and 24, 2004. Omega videotaped Cusson when she was observed outside of her home, and it obtained fifty minutes and fifty-eight seconds of video over the course of these six days. The video footage that was obtained appeared to show Cusson engaged in normal activities. For example, on June 9, Cusson was observed walking her dog for approximately thirty minutes; according to the Omega report, Cusson walked \"in a smooth, fluid manner without exhibiting any external signs of impairment.\" Later that day she drove to a nearby Home Depot store and was seen exiting the store an hour later carrying a shopping bag. On June 24, Cusson was observed having lunch with a friend at a restaurant and then going to a Wal-Mart. Cusson was inside the Wal-Mart for almost one hour, after which she exited with a loaded shopping cart. She loaded the items from her cart, including what Omega's report described as a large bag of cat litter, into her car, and she was also observed bending at the waist to pick up items that had fallen on the ground.</p>\n<p>On July 20, 2004, Liberty told Cusson that if she did not provide proof of her SSA application by August 3, 2004, Liberty <span class=\"star-pagination\">*220</span> would immediately reduce her benefits by the estimated amount of the SSDI benefit. Liberty also instructed Omega to conduct a second round of surveillance. This surveillance occurred between July 26 and 28, during which time Cusson was seen on the surveillance tape once, on July 27, for a total of one minute and seven seconds.</p>\n<p>In August 2004, Liberty ordered a third round of video surveillance. Omega performed this surveillance on August 2, 9-10, 14, and 26. Cusson was seen leaving her home only on August 26. Cusson was observed bending fully at the waist to retrieve an item outside her front door. She was then seen driving to a local restaurant and eating lunch with another person, and was then seen driving to a dry cleaner's, a Wal-Mart, and other department stores. During the course of her errands, she was observed carrying various items into and out of stores and bending at the waist to retrieve items from or place items into her car.</p>\n<p>On September 15, 2004, Cusson completed another Activities Questionnaire from Liberty, in which she described her functional limitations, including pain, fatigue, memory loss, and inability to concentrate. Cusson reported that since her last Activities Questionnaire from March 28, 2003, she could not remember going to a mall because malls were \"just too big\"; instead, Cusson noted, she went \"mostly to small stores [with] easy access in + out.\" Cusson also reported that she had \"good\" days and \"bad\" days. She said that on a \"good\" day she would be able to perform activities such as running errands, visiting other people, and having lunch outside her home. However, she reported that on a \"bad\" day she would be unable to sleep because of her pain and would often be unable to get out of bed for several days.</p>\n<p>On October 13, 2004, Figueroa reported to Liberty that, during an eight-hour work day, Cusson could sit for less than two hours, stand for less than thirty minutes, and walk for fifteen minutes. Figueroa also noted that Cusson could not lift or carry more than ten pounds and could not work eight hours per day in any occupation. Two days later, Figueroa reported to Liberty that Cusson's \"limitations tend to vary with the severity of [her] symptoms.\"</p>\n<p>Upon receipt of Figueroa's reports, Liberty referred Cusson's file to Dr. Robert Millstein (\"Millstein\"), a full-time Liberty employee, for review. Millstein reviewed Cusson's claim and concluded that \"the video surveillance demonstrates functional capacity which exceeds that reported on the most recent activities questionnaire and confirms that the claimant retains the physical capacity to perform full-time work at a light level.\" Millstein noted a number of apparent inconsistencies between Cusson's reported limitations and the video surveillance. For example, Millstein noted that although Cusson reported fatigue, the surveillance showed that \"on consecutive days, [Cusson] is seen out of her house for long periods of time performing activities which would be best characterized as requiring light to medium physical capacity.\" Thus, Millstein concluded, \"the record does not support the presence of fatigue which would preclude full-time work.\" Millstein also noted that Cusson was seen going into large stores, such as Wal-Mart and Home Depot, even though she had previously reported that she did not go to malls because malls were too big. Millstein also noted that Cusson was seen bending at the waist and placing a large object, a bag of cat litter, in her car.</p>\n<p>Millstein's report contained inaccurate statements about the surveillance results. Millstein frequently confused sightings of Cusson <i>returning</i> home with sightings of Cusson <i>leaving</i> her home. Millstein also said that on certain days Cusson left her <span class=\"star-pagination\">*221</span> home and remained out of her home for long periods, when in fact the surveillance for those days clearly shows that Cusson returned to her home at various points throughout the day. As a result of these errors, Millstein's report overstates the amount of time Cusson spent outside of her home on certain days, sometimes by as much as a factor of three.</p>\n<p>In November 2004, Liberty ordered a fourth round of surveillance, this time conducted by MJM Investigations, Inc. (\"MJM\"). MJM observed Cusson on November 2-6 and 11, 2004. Cusson was seen outside of her home for a total of roughly half an hour over the course of the surveillance. On November 2, Cusson was observed exiting her house carrying various bags and leaving her home as the passenger in a car. On November 4 and 11, Cusson was briefly seen driving to various locations to run errands. Cusson was not seen outside of her home on November 3, 5, or 6.</p>\n<p>On November 29, 2004, Liberty conducted a Transferable Skills Analysis and Labor Market Survey (\"TSA\") of Cusson's claim, relying solely on Millstein's report. The analysis concluded that Cusson could perform her occupation as a Facilities Manager as well as other occupations, such as Construction Manager, Property/Real Estate Manager, and Civil Engineer.</p>\n<p>On December 8, 2004, Liberty sent Cusson a letter informing her that her benefits were being terminated. The letter discussed the video surveillance and Millstein's review of Cusson's file. The letter also noted the results of the TSA and informed Cusson that she was capable of performing her original job as a Facility Planner. In addition, the letter noted that Liberty had written to Figueroa requesting a response to Millstein's report and the video surveillance, but that Figueroa had not responded.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Cusson's Appeal and Further Tests</h2>\n<p>On June 1, 2005, Cusson notified Liberty that she was appealing its decision to terminate her benefits. Cusson submitted various documents, including her own sworn statement; affidavits from her friends, family, and former colleagues; and a chart comparing the surveillance reports with her own recollection of her activities on the days she was surveilled. Cusson's sworn statement and activity chart indicate that on some of the days she was seen outside of her home, she would \"hit a wall\" and return home \"crying in pain.\" However, Cusson's activity chart is completely silent as to what she was doing, or what symptoms she was experiencing, on many days when she was not observed outside of her home.</p>\n<p>Cusson also submitted medical reports from in-person examinations by Dr. Peter Schur (\"Schur\"), a rheumatologist, and Drs. Daniel Cohen (\"Cohen\") and Jean Matheson (\"Matheson\"), who specialize in sleep disorders. Schur's examination was paid for by Cusson's health insurer as part of her treatment. Schur's examination indicated that Cusson had limited motion in her shoulders, hips, and back; had \"fair muscle tone at best\"; and was painfully sensitive to touch. Schur concluded that Cusson was disabled \"at present,\" and recommended treatment options. Cohen and Matheson indicated that Cusson had trouble sleeping because of her pain, but they did not render an opinion as to disability.</p>\n<p>Cusson also submitted a report from Paul Blatchford, Ed. M. (\"Blatchford\"), a vocational rehabilitation expert, who conducted an in-person evaluation on February 15, 2005. Blatchford's report detailed Cusson's impaired performance on a variety of standardized vocational tests approved by the United States Department of Labor (\"DOL\"). The report noted that Cusson appeared exhausted and distracted <span class=\"star-pagination\">*222</span> throughout the entire proceeding. Blatchford noted that under DOL guidelines, the occupations for which Cusson was qualified required \"sedentary\" to \"light\" exertion levels. Blatchford concluded that Cusson's functional capacity precluded her from performing and sustaining any work-related activities. Blatchford also disputed Liberty's interpretation of the surveillance videos. He argued that the videos failed to address Cusson's cognitive limitations. He also noted that although the video showed that Cusson was capable of short periods of activity, a fact that she herself had reported, it did not show Cusson engaged in <i>sustained</i> activity that would be necessary for any kind of employment.</p>\n<p>On July 26, 2005, Liberty informed Cusson that it had referred her file for two peer reviews. Both reviews were paid for by Liberty. One review was conducted by Dr. Walter Longo (\"Longo\"), an oncologist, who determined that there was \"no objective data supporting ongoing impairment due to prior therapy\" for breast cancer, but that it was possible that Cusson could have limitations due to fibromyalgia. The other was conducted by Dr. Jeffrey Liebermann (\"Liebermann\"), a rheumatologist, who concluded that Cusson \"should be able to perform the duties of light or sedentary occupations\" despite her fibromyalgia, and that Cusson's impairments were \"entirely subjective.\" Liebermann also claimed to have spoken on the phone with Figueroa. Liebermann reported that during his conversation with Figueroa, Figueroa said that he had told Cusson that he no longer wished to be consulted about the disability aspects of her case. On August 11, 2005, Liebermann sent Figueroa a letter purporting to summarize their conversation and requesting that Figueroa review and make comments or corrections to the letter and fax it back to him. Figueroa did not sign the letter or return it.</p>\n<p>On September 7, 2005, Cusson underwent an examination by Dr. Mitchell Abramson (\"Abramson\"). Abramson reported that Cusson had \"multiple trigger points\" for pain and was unable to bend forward more than forty degrees due to back pain. Abramson concluded that Cusson \"appear[ed] to be disabled due to her medical illness.\" On September 9, 2005, Blatchford wrote an addendum to his February 15, 2005 report, stating that Liberty's interpretation of the surveillance reports was \"inaccurate, and contradicted by the videotapes themselves.\" Blatchford noted that the video of Cusson running errands was \"consistent with [Cusson's] ability to perform activities for limited periods of time,\" but that Cusson's need for frequent rest and her \"tendency to `fade' after engaging in any task for a sustained period of time\" showed that she \"lack[ed] the ability to engage in sustained work, whether sedentary or otherwise.\"</p>\n<p>Cusson submitted Abramson's report, Blatchford's addendum, and other documentation to Liberty on September 15, 2005. In response, Liberty conducted a second round of peer reviews. Both of these additional reviews were conducted by MLS National Medical Evaluations, Inc. (\"MLS\") and paid for by Liberty. The first review was conducted by Dr. Reynold Karr (\"Karr\"), a rheumatologist, who concluded that he did not \"identify any objective medical basis for impairment or need for physical restrictions based upon review of the accompanying medical record.\" The second MLS review was conducted by Dr. Matthew Kaufman (\"Kaufman\"), an oncologist. Kaufman indicated that, from his perspective as an oncologist, there was no \"identifiable or medically supported level of functional impairment that can be objectively verified.\" However, Kaufman noted that fibromyalgia fell outside his area of expertise, and conceded that Cusson \"may have a level of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*223</span> functional impairment due to ... fibromyalgia and/or psychological overlay.\"</p>\n<p>On November 1, 2005, Liberty upheld its decision to terminate Cusson's benefits. Liberty stated that \"based on the totality of clinical and objective medical documentation contained in Ms. Cusson's file, sedentary to light capacity has been established.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. Award of SSDI Benefits</h2>\n<p>On January 21, 2006, an Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") awarded Cusson SSDI benefits, with a disability date of March 15, 2002. In granting the benefits, the ALJ found that Cusson was \"unable to do sustained work activities in an ordinary work setting on a regular and continuing basis.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>F. District Court Proceedings</h2>\n<p>On December 7, 2005, Cusson filed suit against Liberty and the LTD Plan in the District of Massachusetts under ERISA, 29 U.S.C. § 1001 <i>et seq.</i> Cusson sought to recover her benefits pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B). Liberty answered and asserted a counterclaim seeking reimbursement for overpayment of benefits under the Policy as a result of Cusson having received SSDI benefits. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on all issues.</p>\n<p>Because the LTD Plan gave Liberty discretion to determine eligibility for benefits, the district court applied an abuse of discretion standard to Liberty's decision. Under this standard, Liberty's decision would be upheld if it was \"reasoned and supported by substantial evidence.\" <i>Gannon v. Metro. Life Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200864\"><a href=\"/opinion/200864/gannon-v-metropolitan-life/\"><span class=\"volume\">360</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">211</span></a></span>, 213 (1st Cir.2004). The district court recognized that Liberty had a structural conflict of interest, since it both evaluated benefit claims and paid the benefits. However, the district court, citing the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. v. Glenn,</i> held that even in the face of a conflict, the standard of review remained deferential, and that the conflict was \"one factor among many that a reviewing judge must take into account.\" ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145788\"><a href=\"/opinion/145788/metropolitan-life-ins-co-v-glenn/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></a></span> (2008).</p>\n<p>Cusson made two main arguments in her district court case opposing the denial of benefits. First, she argued that Liberty and its reviewers improperly used and interpreted the surveillance videos. Second, she argued that Liberty's review process was flawed, and that these flaws showed that Liberty's decision was an abuse of discretion. The district court held that Liberty's decision to terminate her benefits was not an abuse of discretion. With respect to the surveillance results, the court held that, although the surveillance supported the inference that Cusson could not perform sustained activity, the surveillance also supported the inference that \"Cusson and Dr. Figueroa had significantly overstated [Cusson's] functional limitations.\" The court also rejected Cusson's various claims of procedural unfairness in Liberty's review process. In addition to upholding Liberty's decision to terminate Cusson's benefits, the court also granted summary judgment to Liberty on its counterclaim.</p>\n<p>Cusson now appeals the district court's decision.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Applicable Law and Standard of Review</h2>\n<p>We review a district court's grant of summary judgment <i>de novo. </i><i>Thompson v. Coca-Cola Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203244\"><a href=\"/opinion/203244/thompson-v-coca-cola-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">168</span></a></span>, 175 (1st Cir.2008). Normally, when we review a district court's grant of summary judgment, \"[w]e will reverse only if, after reviewing the facts and making all inferences in favor of the non-moving party [here, Cusson], the evidence on record is sufficiently <span class=\"star-pagination\">*224</span> open-ended to permit a rational factfinder to resolve the issue in favor of either side.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted). However, in an ERISA benefit-denial context, \"the district court sits more as an appellate tribunal than as a trial court.\" <i>Leahy v. Raytheon Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200246\"><a href=\"/opinion/200246/leahy-v-raytheon-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">315</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 18 (1st Cir.2002). In such cases, \"summary judgment is simply a vehicle for deciding the issue,\" and, consequently, \"the non-moving party is not entitled to the usual inferences in its favor.\" <i>Orndorf v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201537\"><a href=\"/opinion/201537/orndorf-v-paul-revere-life-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">510</span></a></span>, 517 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>When an ERISA plan gives the administrator the discretion to determine eligibility for benefits (as in this case), a reviewing court must uphold that decision unless it is \"arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.\" <i>Gannon,</i> 360 F.3d at 213 (citing <i>Vlass v. Raytheon Employees Disability Trust,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199334\"><a href=\"/opinion/199334/vlass-v-raytheon-employees/\"><span class=\"volume\">244</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 30 (1st Cir. 2001)). However, Cusson argues that the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Glenn</i> changed the standard of review from an abuse of discretion standard to a \"combination of factors\" standard in cases where, as here, there is a structural conflict of interest. We disagree.</p>\n<p>In deciding what effect a conflict would have on the standard of review, the Supreme Court in <i>Glenn</i> \"elucidate[d] what [the] Court said in <i>Firestone,</i> namely, that a conflict should `be weighed as a factor in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion.'\" <i>Glenn,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 2350 (quoting <i>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112197\"><a href=\"/opinion/112197/firestone-tire-rubber-co-v-bruch/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">101</span></a></span>, 115, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112197\"><a href=\"/opinion/112197/firestone-tire-rubber-co-v-bruch/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span> (1989)). However, the Court went on to say, \"We do not believe that <i>Firestone</i>'s statement implies a change in the <i>standard</i> of review, say, from deferential to <i>de novo</i> review.\" <i>Id.</i> Rather, the Court said that \"<i>Firestone</i> means what the word `factor' implies, namely, that when judges review the lawfulness of benefit denials, they will often take account of several different considerations of which a conflict of interest is one.\" <i>Id.</i> at 2351.</p>\n<p>Because <i>Glenn</i> did not alter the standard of review, and because our review of the lower court's grant of summary judgment is <i>de novo,</i> we will review Liberty's decision to deny Cusson's benefits under the same abuse of discretion standard used by the district court. <i>See </i><i>Denmark v. Liberty Life Assurance Co.</i> (<i>Denmark III</i>), <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">566</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 9 (1st Cir.2009) (where the plan administrator has discretion, \"<i>Glenn</i>'s baseline principle, consistent with this circuit's prior precedents, [is] that judicial review of such a benefit-denial decision is for abuse of discretion\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Appropriate Weight Given to the Conflict of Interest</h2>\n<p>Although the presence of a conflict of interest does not change the standard of review in this case, the conflict itself can, under certain circumstances, be accorded extra weight in the court's analysis. In <i>Glenn,</i> the Supreme Court held that \"[t]he conflict of interest at issue ... should prove more important (perhaps of great importance) where circumstances suggest a higher likelihood that it affected the benefits decision, including, but not limited to, cases where an insurance company administrator has a history of biased claims administration.\" 128 S.Ct. at 2351. On the other hand, the conflict \"should prove less important (perhaps to the vanishing point) where the administrator has taken active steps to reduce potential bias and to promote accuracy.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>We have interpreted this language from <i>Glenn</i> to mean that \"courts are duty-bound to inquire into what steps a plan administrator has taken to insulate the decisionmaking process against the potentially pernicious effects of structural conflicts.\" <i>Denmark III,</i> 566 F.3d at 9. Although <span class=\"star-pagination\">*225</span> Cusson argues that it is Liberty's burden to show that the conflict did not affect its decision, the Supreme Court explicitly declined to specify a burden-of-proof rule for determining the weight that a conflict should be given. <i>See Glenn,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 2351 (\"Neither do we believe it necessary or desirable for courts to create special burden-of-proof rules, or other special procedural or evidentiary rules, focused narrowly upon the evaluator/payer conflict.\"). We therefore apply the same burden of proof to the conflict issue that we do to any other aspect of an ERISA claim for improper denial of benefits; hence, Cusson bears the burden of showing that the conflict influenced Liberty's decision. <i>See </i><i>Terry v. Bayer Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"754634\"><a href=\"/opinion/754634/michael-f-terry-v-bayer-corporation-and-bayer-corporation-disability-plan/\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span>, 34 (1st Cir.1998) (\"Here, [claimant] bears the burden of making a showing sufficient to establish a violation of ERISA, namely, that the benefit termination was unreasonable.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>Cusson has not raised (and, thus, the parties have not briefed) the issue of the adequacy of Liberty's internal procedures to insulate the review process from the conflict. Instead, Cusson argues that certain alleged flaws in the way the review was conducted prove that Liberty's decision was influenced by its conflict. As discussed below, we do not find that these alleged flaws show that Liberty was improperly influenced by its conflict.</p>\n<p>Firstly, Cusson argues that Liberty relied exclusively on Millstein's report, including his inaccurate statements about the surveillance results, rather than relying on the totality of the record. Cusson correctly points out that in its initial denial letter, Liberty quoted language that it <i>claimed</i> was from the surveillance reports, but that was actually from Millstein's interpretation of the surveillance. Liberty also claimed that it relied on its TSA, but the record indicates that the TSA was based solely on Millstein's report.</p>\n<p>We find nothing wrong with the degree of Liberty's reliance on Millstein's report. Although the denial letter from Liberty quoted Millstein's summary of the surveillance data, and not the surveillance reports themselves, the record also indicates that Liberty's case manager did review the tapes. Moreover, as the district court noted, even though Millstein made inaccurate statements about the surveillance data in his report, Millstein's main substantive point about the surveillance that it showed Cusson engaged in activities that she claimed she could not dowas accurate. Many of the activities that Cusson was observed doing were activities that she specifically reported being unable to do, such as bending at the waist and lifting objects heavier than ten pounds. Moreover, when Cusson was seen outside, she did not appear to show any signs of fatigue or impaired physical capabilities. While this is by no means ironclad proof of ability to work, it is evidence that Liberty was entitled to consider. We read Liberty's decision as being based not simply on the <i>amount</i> of activity observed, but also on the <i>nature</i> of the activity observed, and Millstein's report contained no errors with respect to the latter.</p>\n<p>Next, Cusson argues that Liberty improperly relied on Liebermann's hearsay testimony about his conversation with Figueroa. Liebermann claimed that he spoke with Figueroa and that Figueroa \"understood that there was a significant discrepancy between the claimant's reported functionality and what was seen on the surveillance tapes.\" Liebermann further claimed that Figueroa indicated that he had told Cusson that he no longer wished to be involved in the disability aspect of her case. However, Cusson noted that Figueroa never responded to Liebermann's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*226</span> request to sign off on Liebermann's account of their conversation. Thus, Cusson argues, Liebermann's entire account of the conversation is hearsay that neither Liberty nor the district court should have relied on in its decision.</p>\n<p>However, \"[a] plan administrator is not a court of law and is not bound by the rules of evidence.\" <i>Speciale v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Ass'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1443270\"><a href=\"/opinion/1443270/speciale-v-blue-cross-and-blue-shield-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">615</span></a></span>, 622 n. 4 (7th Cir.2008). Because Figueroa never responded to Liebermann's request to comment on his account of the conversation, it was not an abuse of discretion for Liberty to assume that Liebermann's account of the conversation was accurate. Since Cusson never presented Liberty with any evidence to challenge directly Liebermann's account of the conversation, we find nothing inappropriate about Liberty's reliance on that account.</p>\n<p>Cusson next argues that Liberty's reviewing physicians were biased against patients with fibromyalgia. Although Liebermann's report mentions some of the evidence submitted by Cusson, Cusson alleges that Liebermann reached his conclusion about her ability to work without actually analyzing the medical evidence in her file. In his report, Liebermann stated: \"This claimant has a diagnosis of [f]ibromyalgia. As such, she should be able to perform the duties of light or sedentary occupations.\" Cusson argues that this statement indicates that Liebermann had a preconceived notion that fibromyalgia could <i>never</i> be a disabling diagnosis, and thus did not fairly consider her file. Similarly, Millstein cited a 1986 study of fibromyalgia patients that indicated that most of them were eventually able to return to work. Cusson points out that the Seventh Circuit has held that \"[t]he fact that the majority of individuals suffering from fibromyalgia can work is the weakest possible evidence that [an individual claimant] can.\" <i>Hawkins v. First Union Corp. Long Term Disability Plan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781680\"><a href=\"/opinion/781680/mark-c-hawkins-v-first-union-corporation-long-term-disability-plan/\"><span class=\"volume\">326</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">914</span></a></span>, 919 (7th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p>If Liebermann or Millstein had said that fibromyalgia patients are never disabled, those statements would be clearly wrong. However, although Liebermann and Millstein made statements that might be interpreted as improper generalizations, it does not necessarily follow that they relied on such generalizations when issuing their reports. Had either doctor concluded that Cusson was not disabled because fibromyalgia is never or not always disabling, that conclusion would have been inappropriate. However, both doctors' reports indicate that they reviewed the surveillance footage and based their conclusions on the apparent contradiction between the footage and Cusson's reported impairments.</p>\n<p>Cusson also argues that Liberty's reliance on paper file reviews instead of direct medical examinations shows that it was influenced by its conflict. Cusson acknowledges that this court has found \"a nonexamining physician's review of a claimant's file [to be] ... reliable medical evidence.\" <i>Gannon,</i> 360 F.3d at 214. However, Cusson argues that the particular circumstances of this case warrant a preference for reports by examining physicians. She notes that fibromyalgia is a disease that can only be diagnosed by a clinical examination of a patient based on subjective reports of pain. Certain circuits have held that in such cases some deference to examining physicians is appropriate. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Kalish v. Liberty Life Assurance Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791486\"><a href=\"/opinion/791486/richard-kalish-v-liberty-mutualliberty-life-assurance-company-of-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">419</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">501</span></a></span>, 509-10 (6th Cir.2005); <i>Hawkins,</i> 326 F.3d at 919 (the \"gravest problem\" with the opinion offered by an ERISA plan administrator's paper-reviewing doctor was his refusal to accept \"subjective symptoms\" of pain and fatigue known to be associated with fibromyalgia). Moreover, Cusson notes that Liberty's reviewing physicians were paid for their reports <span class=\"star-pagination\">*227</span> by Liberty, whereas Cusson's treating physicians were paid by her health insurance company. The Supreme Court has recognized that \"physicians repeatedly retained by benefits plans may have an incentive to make a finding of `not disabled' in order to save their employers money and to preserve their own consulting arrangements.\" <i>Black &amp; Decker Disability Plan v. Nord,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127929\"><a href=\"/opinion/127929/black-decker-disability-plan-v-nord/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">822</span></a></span>, 832, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127929\"><a href=\"/opinion/127929/black-decker-disability-plan-v-nord/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1965</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127929\"><a href=\"/opinion/127929/black-decker-disability-plan-v-nord/\"><span class=\"volume\">155</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1034</span></a></span> (2003) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>We see no reason why the nonexamining physicians' reports in this case are unreliable. We recognize that fibromyalgia is a disease that is diagnosed primarily based on a patient's self-reported pain symptoms. However, Liberty's reviewers did not question the <i>diagnosis</i> of fibromyalgia; instead, they questioned the <i>effect</i> of the disease on Cusson's ability to work. \"[T]his court draws a distinction between requiring objective evidence of the diagnosis, which is impermissible for a condition such as fibromyalgia that does not lend itself to objective verification, and requiring objective evidence that the plaintiff is unable to work, which is allowed.\" <i>Denmark v. Liberty Life Assurance Co.</i> (<i>Denmark II</i>), <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></span>, 37 (1st Cir.2007), <i>vacated </i><i>on other grounds,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">566</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span> (1st Cir.2009). Because it is permissible to require documented, objective evidence of disability, it was not inappropriate for Liberty's reviewers to rely on the lack of such documented evidence, or on the footage that contradicted Cusson's reports of limitations, in making their recommendations. The fact that Liberty's reviewers were paid for their reports does not, by itself, lead us to believe that Liberty was influenced by its conflict, since Cusson has provided no evidence that Liberty retained its reviewers specifically because they have a record of denying claims.</p>\n<p>Next, Cusson claims that Liberty failed to provide her complete medical record to its reviewers. Liberty's internal files indicated that \"[a]ll medical records\" had been sent to its reviewers. However, the reviewers did not list certain documents that were favorable to Cusson such as various medical records, her activity log, and portions of the surveillance reports that showed no activityin their reports. The district court held that under our holding in <i>Tsoulas v. Liberty Life Assurance Co.,</i> it would be improper for the court automatically to assume that unless the medical report lists each item the examiner reviewed, he or she did not review it. <i>See</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202313\"><a href=\"/opinion/202313/tsoulas-v-liberty-life/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></a></span>, 77 (1st Cir.2006). However, Cusson argues that the district court's reliance on <i>Tsoulas</i> was incorrect. Cusson points out that in <i>Tsoulas,</i> the plaintiff's claim that Liberty failed to provide certain documents to the reviewers was obviously incorrect because some of the documents that the plaintiff said were missing were explicitly listed in those same reviewers' reports. <i>Id.</i> In contrast, the documents that Cusson claims were not provided are not listed in any of Liberty's reviewers' reports.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Cusson's attempt to distinguish <i>Tsoulas</i> from this case fails. Contrary to Cusson's position, the reviewing physician reports in <i>Tsoulas</i> did <i>not</i> explicitly mention certain reports that the claimant said were missing; rather, the district court <i>inferred</i> that those documents were provided because the physicians' reports listed <i>some,</i> but not <i>all,</i> of the documents. <i>See id.</i> Likewise, in this case, each of the reviewing physicians' reports list at least some of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*228</span> supplementary material provided by Cusson. Hence, in this case, as in <i>Tsoulas,</i> we find no reason to believe that Liberty did not supply the entire record.</p>\n<p>Finally, Cusson argues that Liberty's failure to credit the SSA's award of disability benefits shows that Liberty was influenced by its conflict. Cusson notes that Liberty insisted that she apply for SSDI benefits, which she was awarded, but now seeks to benefit financially from that award by claiming the right to reimbursement for overpayment. Cusson notes that in <i>Glenn,</i> the Supreme Court treated this behavior as evidence that a conflict influenced the plan administrator's judgment. In <i>Glenn,</i> the plan administrator encouraged the claimant to apply for SSDI benefits and then recovered the bulk of those benefits by virtue of the reimbursement provision. The administrator then turned around and denied benefits for the same disability that it had encouraged the claimant to plead to the SSA. The Court held:</p>\n<blockquote>This course of events was not only an important factor in its own right (because it suggested procedural unreasonableness), but also would have justified the court in giving more weight to the conflict (because MetLife's seemingly inconsistent positions were both financially advantageous).</blockquote>\n<p><i>Glenn,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 2352.</p>\n<p>We find nothing suspicious about Liberty's failure to credit Cusson's successful application for SSDI benefits, because Cusson was not awarded SSDI benefits until after Liberty denied her LTD benefits. We have held that when reviewing an insurer's decision to deny benefits, we determine whether \"the insurer's eligibility determination was unreasonable in light of the information available to it when it made its decision.\" <i>Denmark II,</i> 481 F.3d at 39 (internal quotation mark omitted). Because the SSA's award of benefits had not yet occurred when Liberty made its decision, that fact could not have been known to Liberty.</p>\n<p>In summary, as discussed above, we do not find that Liberty's decision was improperly influenced by its structural conflict of interest. We therefore do not accord any special weight to the conflict in our analysis of whether Liberty's decision was proper, but rather consider it along with all of the factors present in this case to determine if Liberty's ultimate conclusion regarding Cusson's benefits was \"reasoned and supported by substantial evidence.\" <i>Gannon,</i> 360 F.3d at 213. We turn to this question below.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Whether Liberty's Decision Was an Abuse of Discretion</h2>\n<p>Cusson argues that the factors discussed in Section II(B), <i>supra,</i> which she claims show that Liberty was influenced by its conflict, also show that Liberty's ultimate decision was an abuse of discretion. For the same reasons we articulated above, we do not believe that these factors prove that Liberty's decision was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p>Cusson further argues that, contrary to the conclusions of Liberty and its reviewers, the surveillance video does not actually contradict any of her self-reported disabilities. Cusson never claimed that she was <i>entirely</i> incapable of performing normally; rather, she only claimed that she was unable to function normally <i>most of the time.</i> Thus, Cusson argues, given how infrequently she was seen outside of her home during the course of the surveillance, the surveillance is consistent with her claim of disability, and it was an abuse of discretion for Liberty to use it as evidence against her claim. Cusson notes that the surveillance video represents a mere two hour snapshot from twenty days of her life <span class=\"star-pagination\">*229</span> over the course of four months.<sup>[3]</sup> Cusson cites a number of cases in which courts have held that it was an abuse of discretion to rely on such limited surveillance data. <i>See, e.g., Soron v. Liberty Life Assurance Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1173076</span></span>, at *11 (N.D.N.Y. May 2, 2005) (surveillance cannot be used to discount plaintiff's self-reported symptoms where \"it shows her performing isolated activities for brief periods of time with no revelation of consequences\"); <i>Osbun v. Auburn Foundry, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2294565\"><a href=\"/opinion/2294565/osbun-v-auburn-foundry-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">293</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">863</span></a></span>, 870 (N.D.Ind. 2003) (1.5 hours of surveillance video over two days fell short of demonstrating that plaintiff was capable of sustaining a job); <i>Cross v. Metro. Life Ins. Co.,</i> 292 Fed. Appx. 888, 892 (11th Cir.2008) (five days of surveillance resulting in two hours of video provided a \"mere snapshot\" of plaintiff's activities and failed to take into account impact of those activities on plaintiff).</p>\n<p>We conclude that it was reasonable to use the surveillance as evidence against Cusson's claim of disability. We have permitted ERISA plan administrators to use this type of sporadic evidence in the past. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Denmark II,</i> 481 F.3d at 38 (it was not arbitrary and capricious for Liberty to consider reports and photographs from four days of surveillance that showed claimant outside only for short periods of time on two of the four days); <i>Tsoulas,</i> 454 F.3d at 79 (no abuse of discretion where Liberty considered surveillance evidence consisting of four hours per day for three days even though it only represented a \"smallimpliedly non-representativefraction of each day\"). More importantly, although the limited amount of time she was seen outside her home is a factor that weighs in Cusson's favor, Liberty was certainly entitled to take notice of the fact that the video shows Cusson doing particular activities that she claimed she could not do. For example, she is seen going into large stores on two separate occasions, despite having claimed that she avoided malls because they were too big and preferred small stores. While we of course recognize that a Home Depot or a Wal-Mart is not the same thing as a mall, we cannot say that it was an abuse of discretion for Liberty and its reviewers to conclude that Cusson's apparent ability to navigate very large stores contradicted her claim that her illness required her to frequent small stores. The surveillance also shows Cusson bending, kneeling, picking up large objects such as a bag of cat litter, and pushing a loaded cart, despite the fact that the Functional Capacities Form completed by Figueroa on May 7, 2004 indicated that Cusson was physically unable to perform these activities.</p>\n<p>Because we find that Liberty was entitled to credit the surveillance, we are left to determine whether Liberty's ultimate conclusion was supported by the totality of the evidence. We find that it was. Cusson argues that Liberty failed to consider her objective evidence of disability. However, the record reflects that Liberty reached its decision not because it failed to consider the evidence in Cusson's favor, but because it determined that the surveillance results undermined the credibility of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*230</span> important portions of that evidence. Because we review Liberty's decision under an abuse of discretion standard, we must uphold it if we find that it was \"reasoned and supported by substantial evidence in the record.\"<sup>[4]</sup><i>Vlass,</i> 244 F.3d at 30 (internal quotation marks omitted). \"Evidence is substantial when it is reasonably sufficient to support a conclusion. Evidence contrary to an administrator's decision does not make the decision unreasonable, provided substantial evidence supports the decision.\" <i>Wright v. R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Co. Group Benefits Plan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201501\"><a href=\"/opinion/201501/wright-v-donnelley/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></a></span>, 74 (1st Cir.2005). Because we cannot say that the evidence in this case was insufficient to support Liberty's conclusion, we affirm Liberty's decision to terminate Cusson's benefits.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Whether Liberty's Counterclaim Is Allowed</h2>\n<p>Liberty asserted a counterclaim to recover Cusson's SSDI benefits under 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(3), which states that a plan fiduciary can bring a civil action to obtain \"appropriate equitable relief ... to enforce ... the terms of the plan.\" Under the LTD Plan, if Cusson received an overpayment on her disability claim from any source, Liberty \"ha[d] the right to recovery of such overpayments from [Cusson] or [Cusson's] estate.\" Although Liberty terminated Cusson's LTD benefits before Cusson was awarded SSDI benefits, the SSA awarded benefits retroactive to March 15, 2002. Liberty argues that because it paid STD and LTD benefits from this date until December 8, 2004, the SSDI benefits Cusson received for this period are an overpayment, and hence that § 1132(a)(3) allows it to sue to enforce the right to recover the overpayment.</p>\n<p>Cusson argues that Liberty's counterclaim is a legal claim, rather than an equitable claim, and hence that it is not permitted under § 1132(a)(3). Cusson relies on <i>Great-West Life &amp; Annuity Insurance Co. v. Knudson,</i> a case involving a similar overpayment provision in an ERISA plan, in which the Supreme Court held that the plan administrator could not use the overpayment provision to recover the proceeds from the plan beneficiaries' tort suit against a third party because the claim was a legal claim rather than an equitable claim. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118471\"><a href=\"/opinion/118471/great-west-life-annuity-ins-co-v-knudson/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">204</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118471\"><a href=\"/opinion/118471/great-west-life-annuity-ins-co-v-knudson/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">635</span></a></span> (2002). However, the district court, in allowing Liberty's claim, relied on <i>Sereboff v. Mid Atlantic Medical Services, Inc.,</i> in which the Court reached the opposite result and allowed a plan to recover for overpayment of medical expenses when the claimant received money from a third party in tort. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145657\"><a href=\"/opinion/145657/sereboff-v-mid-atlantic-medical-services-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145657\"><a href=\"/opinion/145657/sereboff-v-mid-atlantic-medical-services-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">612</span></a></span> (2006).</p>\n<p>In <i>Knudson,</i> the funds recovered in the suit were not actually in the possession of the plan beneficiaries; rather, they had been placed into a \"Special Needs Trust\" under California law. 534 U.S. at 214, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118471\"><a href=\"/opinion/118471/great-west-life-annuity-ins-co-v-knudson/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">708</span></a></span>. Thus, the Court held that the plan's monetary claim against the beneficiaries would effectively operate as \"the imposition of personal liability for the benefits that [the plan] conferred upon [the beneficiaries],\" which was a legal rather than equitable claim. <i>Id.</i> In contrast, in <i>Sereboff,</i> the beneficiaries had deposited the proceeds from the suit into their personal investment account, and the plan specifically asserted a claim for some portion of those funds. 547 U.S. at 360, 362-63, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145657\"><a href=\"/opinion/145657/sereboff-v-mid-atlantic-medical-services-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1869</span></a></span>. Thus, the Court held that the claim was a type of \"equitable <span class=\"star-pagination\">*231</span> restitution\" because it was for \"specifically identifiable funds that were within the possession and control of the Sereboffs.\" <i>Id.</i> at 362-63, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145657\"><a href=\"/opinion/145657/sereboff-v-mid-atlantic-medical-services-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1869</span></a></span> (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>We find that <i>Sereboff,</i> rather than <i>Knudson,</i> controls in this case. Here, like in <i>Sereboff,</i> the LTD Plan targets specific funds for recoveryCusson's LTD paymentsand identifies the specific portion to which Liberty is entitledthe amount of the overpayment while Cusson was receiving benefits under the LTD Plan. We are persuaded by the Eighth Circuit's holding in a similar case that a claim such as this is a claim for equitable relief. <i>See </i><i>Dillard's Inc. v. Liberty Life Assurance Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795219\"><a href=\"/opinion/795219/dillards-inc-individually-and-as-assignee-of-janet-bolton-v-liberty/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">894</span></a></span>, 901 (8th Cir.2006) (finding that Liberty's claim was equitable when it sought \"a particular share of a specifically identified fund-all overpayments resulting from the payment of social security benefits\"). Moreover, unlike in <i>Knudson,</i> the SSDI benefit was paid to Cusson rather than into a separate trust over which she has no control. It is true that, unlike the insurer in <i>Sereboff,</i> Liberty has not identified a specific account in which the funds are kept or proven that they are still in Cusson's possession. However, the Court in <i>Sereboff</i> noted \"`the familiar rul[e] of equity that a contract to convey a specific object even before it is acquired will make the contractor a trustee as soon as he gets a title to the thing.'\" 547 U.S. at 363-64, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145657\"><a href=\"/opinion/145657/sereboff-v-mid-atlantic-medical-services-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1869</span></a></span> (quoting <i>Barnes v. Alexander,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"98064\"><a href=\"/opinion/98064/barnes-v-alexander/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">117</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">276</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">530</span></span> (1914)). Here, the contract between Cusson and Liberty put Cusson on notice that she would be required to reimburse Liberty for an amount equal to what she might get from Social Security. We therefore find that Liberty's counterclaim is an equitable claim and is allowed under 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(3).</p>\n<p>Cusson further argues that Liberty's claim is barred under the Social Security Act, Title II, 47 U.S.C. §§ 401 <i>et seq.</i> The Act provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote>The right of any person to any future payment under this title shall not be transferable or assignable, at law or in equity, and none of the moneys paid or payable or rights existing under this title shall be subject to execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process, or to the operation of any bankruptcy or insolvency law.</blockquote>\n<p>42 U.S.C. § 407(a). The district court held that this section of the Act only applies to future payments, and not to retroactive payments. However, Cusson argues that the reference to \"moneys paid or payable\" indicates that the statute's protections apply to all payments, whether future payments or retroactive payments.</p>\n<p>We agree with the district court that 42 U.S.C. § 407(a) does not bar Liberty's claim. However, we disagree with the district court's reasoning in reaching this conclusion. The district court held that because the statute bars the transfer or assignment of the right to \"future payment,\" it did not bar claims for retroactive payments. However, the statute clearly goes on to say that \"none of the moneys <i>paid</i> or payable ... shall be subject to execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process.\" <i>Id.</i> Thus, the protections afforded by § 407(a) apply to retroactive SSDI payments. <i>See </i><i>Philpott v. Essex County Welfare Bd.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108653\"><a href=\"/opinion/108653/philpott-v-essex-county-welfare-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">413</span></a></span>, 416, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108653\"><a href=\"/opinion/108653/philpott-v-essex-county-welfare-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">608</span></a></span> (1973) (holding that a state could not recover SSDI benefits paid because \"the protection afforded by § 407(a) is to `moneys paid'\"); <i>Hoult v. Hoult,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201075\"><a href=\"/opinion/201075/hoult-v-hoult/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span>, 56 (1st Cir.2004) (\"There is no question that § 407(a) ... applies to benefits after they have been distributed to beneficiaries.\").</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*232</span> Instead, we find that § 407(a) does not bar Liberty's claim because Liberty is not attempting to recover Cusson's SSDI benefits. Rather, Liberty seeks to recover in equity from funds Liberty itself already paid under the LTD plan. Although the amount in question happens to be the same as the amount of Cusson's retroactive SSDI payment, the funds Liberty is targeting do not come from SSDI, and thus § 407(a) does not prohibit Liberty's claim. <i>See </i><i>Holmstrom v. Metro. Life Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1515035\"><a href=\"/opinion/1515035/holmstrom-v-metropolitan-life-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">615</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">722</span></a></span>, 753 (N.D.Ill. 2009) (collecting cases in which courts have held that § 407(a) does not bar recovery for overpayment).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  For additional background, see the decision below. <i>Cusson v. Liberty Life Assurance Co.,</i> No. 78-3386, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. Dist. LEXIS</span> <span class=\"page\">77084</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4457862</span></span> (D.Mass. Sep. 30, 2008).</p>\n<p>[2]  Cusson also argues that, in the wake of <i>Glenn,</i> the district court was wrong to place the burden of proof on her to show that the records were not provided. However, as we noted above, the Supreme Court <i>explicitly</i> chose <i>not</i> to impose any new burden-of-proof rules with respect to conflicts.</p>\n<p>[3]  Cusson argued to the district court that Liberty's internal training manuals regarding video surveillance should have been admitted to the record. The district court denied this request because Cusson did not demonstrate a \"very good reason\" for the inclusion of the manuals. <i>See </i><i>Liston v. Unum Corp. Officer Severance Plan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200479\"><a href=\"/opinion/200479/liston-v-unum-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">330</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir. 2003). Cusson challenges this decision on appeal. However, Cusson does not clearly explain why these documents would assist this court in determining whether Liberty's decision was an abuse of discretion. Because we do not see why these documents would be relevant to this case, we do not reach the issue of whether the district court properly excluded them.</p>\n<p>[4]  In our prior ERISA cases, we have variously described the standard of review, applicable when an ERISA plan grants the plan administrator the discretion to determine eligibility for benefits, as review for \"abuse of discretion,\" \"arbitrariness and capriciousness,\" and \"substantial evidence.\" In the ERISA benefit-denial context, these terms are interchangeable. <i>See </i><i>Denmark III,</i> 566 F.3d at 7.</p>\n\n</div>",
