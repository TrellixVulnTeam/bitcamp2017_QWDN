Joseph L. Tauro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                        Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Selya and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Christie M. Charles, George F. Gormley, and George F. Gormley,\nP.C. on brief for appellant.\n     Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, and Wendy\nWaldron, Trial Attorney, United States Department of Justice, on\nbrief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                            May 7, 2008\n\f           SELYA, Senior Circuit Judge.    This appeal requires us to\n\nanswer for the first time the question of whether the interstate\n\ntransport of a minor for prostitution in violation of 18 U.S.C. §\n\n2423(a) constitutes a crime of violence within the purview of the\n\ncareer offender provision of the federal sentencing guidelines.\n\nSee USSG §4B1.2(a). That answer is complicated by a recent Supreme\n\nCourt decision, which this court has not yet addressed.       Working\n\nour way through the precedential labyrinth, we conclude that the\n\ntawdry and purposeful conduct proscribed by the statute presents a\n\nserious potential risk of physical injury to the minor and is\n\nsufficiently similar to the types of crimes enumerated in the\n\nrelevant   guideline   provision.         Accordingly,   we   respond\n\naffirmatively to the question and affirm the sentence imposed\n\nbelow.\n\n           We rehearse here only those facts that are essential to\n\nan understanding and resolution of the issue on appeal.       At this\n\nstage of the proceedings, those facts are not genuinely disputed.\n\n           During a period that spanned portions of the years 2000\n\nto 2002, defendant-appellant Robert Williams engaged in activities\n\nrelated to prostitution.   On several occasions, he either took or\n\nsent a young girl from Massachusetts into neighboring states to\n\nperform sex acts in exchange for money.         While the appellant\n\nmaintains that he did not know that the girl was only thirteen\n\nyears of age when the trafficking began, he admittedly learned the\n\n\n                                -2-\n\ftruth on or about July 1, 2001.        He nevertheless persisted in his\n\ncourse of illicit conduct after that disclosure.\n\n            On August 3, 2005, a federal grand jury returned a\n\nthirteen-count indictment related to these meretricious activities.\n\nAfter initially maintaining his innocence, the appellant pleaded\n\nguilty to all twelve counts in which he was named.               Although each\n\nof those counts was linked to the prostitution of the minor, four\n\ncounts specifically charged the appellant with violating 18 U.S.C.\n\n§   2423(a).1      That   statute   proscribes    the   knowing     interstate\n\ntransport of a minor for purposes of prostitution.\n\n            The presentence investigation report recommended that the\n\nappellant be sentenced as a career offender.            At the disposition\n\nhearing, the appellant challenged his purported career offender\n\nstatus.     That    challenge   centered   on    whether   the    offenses   of\n\nconviction (or, at least, some of them) constituted crimes of\n\nviolence.\n\n            Refined to bare essence, the challenge had two parts.\n\nFirst, in an attempt to distinguish his conduct from conduct that\n\nthis court previously had deemed violent, the appellant pointed to\n\nthe absence of any charges related to his personal sexual contact\n\n\n      1\n      The other eight counts variously charged the appellant with\ntransporting an individual interstate to engage in prostitution in\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 2421; inducing travel to engage in\nprostitution in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2422(a); trafficking\nchildren for sex in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591; and conspiring\nin sex trafficking and in inducing interstate travel for the\npurpose of prostitution in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371.\n\n                                     -3-\n\fwith the minor.       Second, the appellant sought to characterize the\n\nunderlying activities as a \"joint business venture\" between himself\n\nand the minor, in which she was a willing participant.\n\n            The   district   court   rejected   these    exhortations       and\n\nsentenced the appellant, as a career offender, to a 151-month\n\nincarcerative term.2       This timely appeal followed.          In it, the\n\nappellant    persists      in     challenging   the     district     court's\n\ndetermination that the charges to which he pleaded guilty qualify\n\nhim for the career offender enhancement.\n\n            To understand the appellant's argument, it is helpful to\n\nsurvey the architecture of the career offender provision.              Under\n\nthat provision, a defendant is subject to an enhanced sentence if\n\n(i) he was eighteen years old at the time he committed the instant\n\noffense; (ii) that offense was either a crime of violence or a\n\ncontrolled substance offense; and (iii) he had at least two prior\n\nfelony convictions for either crimes of violence or controlled\n\nsubstance offenses.      USSG §4B1.1(a).     In this instance, the first\n\nand third requirements are not in issue.        The appellant was forty-\n\nfive years of age when he first encountered the minor and his\n\ncriminal    history    includes    the   requisite    number   and   kind    of\n\npredicate offenses.      Thus, this appeal turns on whether any of the\n\noffenses to which the appellant pleaded guilty in the court below\n\n\n\n     2\n      In formulating the sentence, the court afforded the appellant\na credit for acceptance of responsibility. See USSG §3E1.1.\n\n                                     -4-\n\fqualify as crimes of violence. This poses a quintessentially legal\n\nquestion, which engenders de novo review.        United States v. Eirby,\n\n515 F.3d 31, 37 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n            For sentencing purposes, the term \"crime of violence\" is\n\na term of art.    The guidelines define a crime of violence as:\n\n            [A]ny offense under federal or state law,\n            punishable   by  imprisonment for a  term\n            exceeding one year, that\n\n                   (1) has as an element the use,\n            attempted use, or threatened use of physical\n            force against the person of another, or\n\n                   (2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson,\n            or extortion, involves use of explosives, or\n            otherwise involves conduct that presents a\n            serious potential risk of physical injury to\n            another.\n\nUSSG §4B1.2(a) (emphasis supplied).\n\n            Here, none of the offenses of conviction explicitly\n\nincludes an element of force.        By the same token, none of them\n\nfalls   within   the   statutory   enumeration    of   specified   crimes.\n\nConsequently, we concentrate our attention on the underscored\n\nstatutory language — variously known as the \"residual clause\" or\n\nthe \"otherwise clause\" — and inquire whether any of the offenses of\n\nconviction presents \"a serious potential risk of physical injury to\n\nanother.\"\n\n            In pursuing this inquiry, we must follow a two-step\n\napproach.     See Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 600-02\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f(1990).3      That approach pertains both when a court is attempting to\n\ncharacterize a predicate offense and when a court is attempting to\n\ncharacterize a current offense.            See United States v. Bell, 966\n\nF.2d 703, 706 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n              This   two-step   approach    is   categorical:   the   court's\n\nanalysis is \"restricted to an examination of how the legislature\n\nhas defined the crime, without any concomitant inquiry into the\n\ndetails of defendant's actual criminal conduct.\"          United States v.\n\nWinter, 22 F.3d 15, 18 (1st Cir. 1994); see Taylor, 495 U.S. at\n\n600.       If the court determines that a violation of the statute in\n\nquestion necessarily involves each and every element of a violent\n\ncrime, then the offense is deemed a crime of violence and the\n\ninquiry is at an end.       See Eirby, 515 F.3d at 37; Winter, 22 F.3d\n\nat 18.\n\n              If, however, the statute's text is broad enough to\n\ncriminalize both violent and non-violent conduct, the court must\n\nembark on the second step of the Taylor pavane.            In so doing, it\n\nmay not undertake a mini-trial of a putative predicate offense, but\n\nit may inspect the record of conviction in order to determine\n\n\n       3\n      To be sure, the issue in Taylor was whether a predicate\noffense constituted a \"violent felony\" under the Armed Career\nCriminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. § 924(e).   Given the similarity\nbetween the ACCA's definition of \"violent felony\" and the\ndefinition of \"crime of violence\" contained in the pertinent\nguideline provision, we previously have taken the position that\nauthority interpreting one phrase is generally persuasive when\ninterpreting the other. See, e.g., United States v. Winter, 22\nF.3d 15, 18 n.3 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n                                     -6-\n\fwhether a defendant was actually charged with an offense that\n\ninvolved violent or potentially violent conduct. See United States\n\nv. Richards, 456 F.3d 260, 263 (1st Cir. 2006).       To satisfy that\n\ncriterion \"the jury must have been required to find (or, in a\n\nguilty plea context, the defendant necessarily must have admitted)\n\nall the elements of a violent felony.\"      Id.\n\n           To trigger the career offender enhancement, it is only\n\nnecessary that one of the twelve offenses of conviction qualifies\n\nas a crime of violence.    For that reason, we need look no further\n\nthan the convictions under 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a) — and we need not go\n\npast the first step in the Taylor pavane.4\n\n           We begin our analysis with the penalty involved in the\n\noffense: those who violate section 2423(a) are subject to a term of\n\nimprisonment of \"not less than 10 years or for life.\"        Id.    Thus,\n\nthe level of punishment easily satisfies the requirement that, to\n\nqualify as a crime of violence, an offense must be punishable by\n\nincarceration for more than one year. See USSG §4B1.2(a).\n\n           We move next to risk of harm.       In this circuit, it is\n\ncommon ground that most \"indecent sexual contact crimes perpetrated\n\nby   adults   against   children   categorically   present   a     serious\n\npotential risk of physical injury.\"      United States v. Cadieux, 500\n\n\n\n      4\n      The government contends that violations of some of the other\nstatutes of conviction are sufficient to trigger the career\noffender provision. It is not necessary for us to address that\nambitious contention.\n\n                                   -7-\n\fF.3d 37, 45 (1st Cir. 2007) (emphasis in original); see, e.g.,\n\nEirby, 515 F.3d at 38 (applying principle to a fourteen- or\n\nfifteen-year-old girl); United States v. Sherwood, 156 F.3d 219,\n\n221 (1st Cir. 1998) (applying principle to molestation of a child\n\nunder age thirteen); United States v. Meader, 118 F.3d 876, 884\n\n(1st Cir. 1997) (applying principle to statutory rape of a girl\n\nunder fourteen); see also Richards, 456 F.3d at 264 (reasoning in\n\nsame vein in violent felony case); United States v. Sacko, 247 F.3d\n\n21, 22 (1st Cir. 2001) (same).\n\n            These decisions recognize that illicit sexual activity\n\nbetween an adult and a minor (at least a minor below a certain age)\n\nposes   a   significant   risk    that    force   will   be   used    in   the\n\nconsummation of the crime.       See Eirby, 515 F.3d at 38.      This risk\n\narises because such offenses \"typically occur in close quarters,\n\nand are generally perpetrated by an adult upon a victim who is not\n\nonly smaller, weaker, and less experienced, but is also generally\n\nsusceptible to acceding to the coercive power of adult authority\n\nfigures.\"    Sherwood, 156 F.3d at 221 (citing United States v.\n\nVelazquez-Overa, 100 F.3d 418, 422 (5th Cir. 1996)).                 Moreover,\n\nwhen the illicit activity involves sexual intercourse, it poses an\n\nadditional risk of harm due to the possible transmission of social\n\nor venereal diseases.     See United States v. Carter, 266 F.3d 1089,\n\n1091 (9th Cir. 2001); Sacko, 247 F.3d at 24.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\f           The appellant offers no compelling rejoinder to this long\n\nline of well-reasoned precedents.           He does, however, suggest that\n\nhis situation is distinguishable.            The distinction, he says, is\n\nthat his case is \"once removed\" from the potentially harmful\n\nconduct   because     he   himself   was    not    sexually   active    in   the\n\ncommission of any of the charged offenses but, rather, merely\n\nfacilitated others' sexual contact with the minor.             The suggestion\n\nthat this distinction matters is unpersuasive.\n\n           In   our   view,   the    fact   that    the   appellant    was   not\n\npersonally intimate with the minor during the commission of any of\n\nthe section 2423(a) offenses does nothing to diminish the risk that\n\nforce might be used in carrying out the crime.                The appellant's\n\nconduct — knowingly transporting the minor for prostitution —\n\nnecessarily placed the minor in harm's way and led ineluctably to\n\na sex act that typically occurred in close quarters between the\n\nminor and an older man unconcerned with her welfare.                  Thus, the\n\nimbalanced power dynamic that influenced our earlier decisions was\n\nfully operational here.       So were the twin likelihoods that force\n\nmight be used and that serious physical harm might result.\n\n           To cinch matters, the commercial context — the selling of\n\nsex — works against the appellant, not in his favor.                   It seems\n\nself-evident to us that a prostituted child who is exploited in\n\nviolation of section 2423(a) faces more and greater risks than does\n\na seduced child, including the dual risk of physical abuse by\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\feither her pimp or her client.       See Carter, 266 F.3d at 1091.\n\nViewed from a different angle, the risk of injury present in any\n\nprostitution scenario is heightened when the situation involves a\n\nminor.   See United States v. Curtis, 481 F.3d 836, 838 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2007).    And, finally, exposing a young girl to multiple sex\n\npartners obviously adds incrementally to the potential risk of\n\ndisease. Taking these realities into account, we have no hesitancy\n\nin concluding that the appellant's conduct actually increased the\n\nlevel of risk.\n\n          The case law, though scanty, bears out this intuition.\n\nIn Carter, the Ninth Circuit held that a violation of section\n\n2423(a) constitutes a crime of violence. Carter, 256 F.3d at 1091.\n\nThe court assessed the statute categorically and determined that a\n\nprostituted minor faces the risks of \"contracting a sexually\n\ntransmitted disease\" and \"assault or physical abuse by the pimp's\n\ncustomers or by the pimp himself.\"    Id.5\n\n          Similarly, the Curtis court held that the prostitution of\n\na minor in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. § 2C:34-1(b)(3) qualified\n\nas a crime of violence for career offender purposes.   Curtis, 481\n\nF.3d at 838-39.   The court stressed that, in such a situation, a\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      The appellant seeks to distinguish Carter on the facts. This\neffort is unavailing for it ignores the categorical nature of the\napproach that the crime of violence inquiry demands. See Taylor,\n495 U.S. at 600-02.\n\n                               -10-\n\fchild faces a significant risk of serious physical harm from both\n\npimps and customers.    Id.\n\n           The appellant has a fallback position.      He posits that\n\nhis offense cannot qualify as a crime of violence because the minor\n\nconsented to engaging in what he euphemistically terms a \"joint\n\nbusiness venture.\"     To bolster this thesis, he asserts that he\n\nbelieved that the minor was over eighteen during a substantial\n\nportion of the time in question.6\n\n           We find this thesis unconvincing.     Even if the minor had\n\nfactually consented, that consent would not have been legally\n\nvalid.   See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, § 23; Commonwealth v. Miller,\n\n432 N.E.2d 463, 464 (Mass. 1982).       In all events, factual consent\n\nwould not eliminate the potential risks that confronted the child.\n\nSee Aguiar v. Gonzales, 438 F.3d 86, 90-91 (1st Cir. 2006) (finding\n\nthat the risks to a minor, unable to give legal consent, are not\n\ndiminished by factual consent).     Just as consent is not a defense\n\nto a prosecution under section 2423(a), see United States v. Lowe,\n\n145 F.3d 45, 52 (1st Cir. 1998), so too consent in this context\n\ndoes not reconfigure the risk-of-harm calculus.\n\n           Up until April 16, 2008, we could have ended our analysis\n\nat this juncture.    On that date, however, the Supreme Court handed\n\n\n     6\n      The appellant's subjective belief is beside the point.\nMoreover, the significance of his purported lack of knowledge is\nundercut by the fact that two of his four section 2423(a)\nviolations occurred after the appellant admittedly learned how old\nshe was.\n\n                                 -11-\n\fdown its decision in Begay v. United States, 553 U.S. ___ (2008)\n\n[No.   06-11543,   slip   op.].      There   —   well   after   briefing    and\n\nsubmission of this appeal — the Court effectively charted a new\n\ncourse in interpreting the critical violent felony definition of\n\nthe Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B).\n\nFor both prudential and precedential reasons, we have read that\n\nstatute and the almost parallel guidelines language at issue here\n\nas being in pari passu.       See supra note 3.      If that identity is to\n\nbe altered, it cannot be done by this panel.\n\n           We briefly limn the contours of the Begay decision.              The\n\nquestion there was whether Begay's offense — driving under the\n\ninfluence of alcohol (DUI) — constituted a violent felony.                  The\n\nCourt answered this question in the negative because DUI offenses\n\nare more comparable to crimes in \"which the offender need not have\n\nhad any criminal intent at all.\"       Begay, 553 U.S. at ___ [slip op.\n\nat 7-8] (emphasizing that \"the conduct for which the drunk driver\n\nis convicted . . . need not be purposeful or deliberate\").\n\n           The main substantive change that Begay wrought is that\n\nthe Court now requires us to focus not only on the degree of risk\n\nof harm posed by a particular crime but also on whether that crime\n\nis similar \"in kind\" to the enumerated offenses of arson, burglary,\n\nextortion, and the like.          Id. at ___ [slip op. at 5].          To help\n\nanswer   this   \"in   kind\"   query,   the   Begay   Court   adopted    a   new\n\n\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\ftouchstone: asking whether the crime involves purposeful, violent,\n\nand aggressive conduct.           Id. at ___ [slip op. at 7].\n\n                Because a new test is introduced and because the Court's\n\ndecision is itself close, it is hard to be absolutely certain how\n\na majority of the Justices would apply the test to the crime at\n\nissue here — a crime that falls neither within the safe harbor of\n\noffenses        with    limited    scienter   requirements    and    uncertain\n\nconsequences (like DUI, see id. at ___ [slip op. at 8-9]), nor\n\namong those that have deliberate violence as a necessary element or\n\neven       as   an   almost   inevitable   concomitant.      Adjectives   like\n\n\"purposeful\" and \"aggressive\" denote qualities that are ineluctably\n\nmanifested in degree and appear in different combinations;7 they\n\nare, therefore, imprecise aids.\n\n                Notwithstanding this new gloss, a strong argument exists\n\nfor treating the transport of a minor for prostitution as a violent\n\ncrime.      Unlike DUI, the crime is purposeful and the perpetrator is\n\naware of the risks that the prostituted minor will face.                   The\n\ndefendant may well use force to ensure the minor's compliance; but\n\nit is even more likely, and fully foreseeable, that the \"clients\"\n\nwill endanger the minor's safety in various ways.                   As we have\n\n\n       7\n      For example, even the crimes enumerated by Congress in the\nACCA and treated as examples satisfy these requirements only in\nsome measure. Burglary, for instance, can be described as\npurposeful but not, at least in most instances, as purposely\nviolent or necessarily aggressive.

Here,\n\nhowever, the violence often will be carried out by third parties.\n\nBut since the risk of harm is so substantial and so easily foreseen\n\nby the defendant, we discern no basis for distinction.                       Surely,\n\ntying a man to the railroad tracks is an act of violence even\n\nthough    the     oncoming    train    is   the       instrument     through    which\n\ninevitable harm is administered.\n\n            We need go no further.            Only time and future cases can\n\ntell how the Supreme Court will develop its new definition.8                      But\n\ndelivering a minor for prostitution appears to us fairly readily to\n\nfall within both the Court's trio of adjectives and Congress's\n\nharm-based      statutory     definition    (incorporated       in    the    relevant\n\nguideline provision).         Indeed, it is surpassingly difficult to see\n\nhow   burglary     could     be   treated   as    a   violent   crime    yet    child\n\ntrafficking exempted.\n\n            For    the     reasons    elucidated       above,   we    hold     that   a\n\nviolation of section 2423(a) involves purposeful and aggressive\n\n\n\n      8\n      Indeed, the Court has just agreed to review the question of\nclassifying escape crimes.

That answer is complicated by a recent Supreme Court decision, which this court has not yet addressed. Working our way through the precedential labyrinth, we conclude that the tawdry and purposeful conduct proscribed by the statute presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to the minor and is sufficiently similar to the types of crimes enumerated in the relevant guideline provision. Accordingly, we respond affirmatively to the question and affirm the sentence imposed below.</p>\n<p>We rehearse here only those facts that are essential to an understanding and resolution of the issue on appeal. At this stage of the proceedings, those facts are not genuinely disputed.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*3</span> During a period that spanned portions of the years 2000 to 2002, defendant-appellant Robert Williams engaged in activities related to prostitution. On several occasions, he either took or sent a young girl from Massachusetts into neighboring states to perform sex acts in exchange for money. While the appellant maintains that he did not know that the girl was only thirteen years of age when the trafficking began, he admittedly learned the truth on or about July 1, 2001. He nevertheless persisted in his course of illicit conduct after that disclosure.</p>\n<p>On August 3, 2005, a federal grand jury returned a thirteen-count indictment related to these meretricious activities. After initially maintaining his innocence, the appellant pleaded guilty to all twelve counts in which he was named. Although each of those counts was linked to the prostitution of the minor, four counts specifically charged the appellant with violating 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a).<sup>[1]</sup> That statute proscribes the knowing interstate transport of a minor for purposes of prostitution.</p>\n<p>The presentence investigation report recommended that the appellant be sentenced as a career offender. At the disposition hearing, the appellant challenged his purported career offender status. That challenge centered on whether the offenses of conviction (or, at least, some of them) constituted crimes of violence.</p>\n<p>Refined to bare essence, the challenge had two parts. First, in an attempt to distinguish his conduct from conduct that this court previously had deemed violent, the appellant pointed to the absence of any charges related to his personal sexual contact with the minor. Second, the appellant sought to characterize the underlying activities as a \"joint business venture\" between himself and the minor, in which she was a willing participant.</p>\n<p>The district court rejected these exhortations and sentenced the appellant, as a career offender, to a 151-month incarcerative term.<sup>[2]</sup> This timely appeal followed. In it, the appellant persists in challenging the district court's determination that the charges to which he pleaded guilty qualify him for the career offender enhancement.</p>\n<p>To understand the appellant's argument, it is helpful to survey the architecture of the career offender provision. Under that provision, a defendant is subject to an enhanced sentence if (i) he was eighteen years old at the time he committed the instant offense; (ii) that offense was either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense; and (iii) he had at least two prior felony convictions for either crimes of violence or controlled substance offenses. USSG § 4B1.1(a). In this instance, the first and third requirements are not in issue. The appellant was forty-five years of age when he first encountered the minor and his criminal history includes the requisite number and kind of predicate offenses. Thus, this appeal turns on whether any of the offenses to which the appellant pleaded guilty in the court below qualify as crimes of violence. This poses a quintessentially legal question, which engenders de novo review. <i>United States v. Eirby,</i> 515 F.3d 31, 37 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> For sentencing purposes, the term \"crime of violence\" is a term of art. The guidelines define a crime of violence as:</p>\n<blockquote>[A]ny offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or <i>otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p>USSG § 4B1.2(a) (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p>Here, none of the offenses of conviction explicitly includes an element of force. By the same token, none of them falls within the statutory enumeration of specified crimes. Consequently, we concentrate our attention on the underscored statutory language  variously known as the \"residual clause\" or the \"otherwise clause\"  and inquire whether any of the offenses of conviction presents \"a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\"</p>\n<p>In pursuing this inquiry, we must follow a two-step approach. <i>See </i><i>Taylor v. United States,</i> 495 U.S. 575, 600-02, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990).<sup>[3]</sup> That approach pertains both when a court is attempting to characterize a predicate offense and when a court is attempting to characterize a current offense. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Bell,</i> 966 F.2d 703, 706 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n<p>This two-step approach is categorical: the court's analysis is \"restricted to an examination of how the legislature has defined the crime, without any concomitant inquiry into the details of defendant's actual criminal conduct.\" <i>United States v. Winter,</i> 22 F.3d 15, 18 (1st Cir. 1994); <i>see </i><i>Taylor,</i> 495 U.S. at 600, 110 S.Ct. 2143. If the court determines that a violation of the statute in question necessarily involves each and every element of a violent crime, then the offense is deemed a crime of violence and the inquiry is at an end. <i>See </i><i>Eirby,</i> 515 F.3d at 37; <i>Winter,</i> 22 F.3d at 18.</p>\n<p>If, however, the statute's text is broad enough to criminalize both violent and non-violent conduct, the court must embark on the second step of the <i>Taylor</i> pavane. In so doing, it may not undertake a mini-trial of a putative predicate offense, but it may inspect the record of conviction in order to determine whether a defendant was actually charged with an offense that involved violent or potentially violent conduct. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Richards,</i> 456 F.3d 260, 263 (1st Cir.2006). To satisfy that criterion \"the jury must have been required to find (or, in a guilty plea context, the defendant necessarily must have admitted) all the elements of a violent felony.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>To trigger the career offender enhancement, it is only necessary that one of the twelve offenses of conviction qualifies as a crime of violence. For that reason, we need look no further than the convictions under 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a)  and we need not go past the first step in the <i>Taylor</i> pavane.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> We begin our analysis with the penalty involved in the offense: those who violate section 2423(a) are subject to a term of imprisonment of \"not less than 10 years or for life.\" <i>Id.</i> Thus, the level of punishment easily satisfies the requirement that, to qualify as a crime of violence, an offense must be punishable by incarceration for more than one year. <i>See</i> USSG § 4B1.2(a).</p>\n<p>We move next to risk of harm. In this circuit, it is common ground that most \"indecent sexual contact crimes <i>perpetrated by adults</i> against children categorically present a serious potential risk of physical injury.\" <i>United States v. Cadieux,</i> 500 F.3d 37, 45 (1st Cir.2007) (emphasis in original); <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Eirby,</i> 515 F.3d at 38 (applying principle to a fourteen- or fifteen-year-old girl); <i>United States v. Sherwood,</i> 156 F.3d 219, 221 (1st Cir.1998) (applying principle to molestation of a child under age thirteen); <i>United States v. Meader,</i> 118 F.3d 876, 884 (1st Cir.1997) (applying principle to statutory rape of a girl under fourteen); <i>see also </i><i>Richards,</i> 456 F.3d at 264 (reasoning in same vein in violent felony case); <i>United States v. Sacko,</i> 247 F.3d 21, 22 (1st Cir.2001) (same).</p>\n<p>These decisions recognize that illicit sexual activity between an adult and a minor (at least a minor below a certain age) poses a significant risk that force will be used in the consummation of the crime. <i>See </i><i>Eirby,</i> 515 F.3d at 38. This risk arises because such offenses \"typically occur in close quarters, and are generally perpetrated by an adult upon a victim who is not only smaller, weaker, and less experienced, but is also generally susceptible to acceding to the coercive power of adult authority figures.\" <i>Sherwood,</i> 156 F.3d at 221 (citing <i>United States v. Velazquez-Overa,</i> 100 F.3d 418, 422 (5th Cir.1996)). Moreover, when the illicit activity involves sexual intercourse, it poses an additional risk of harm due to the possible transmission of social or venereal diseases. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Carter,</i> 266 F.3d 1089, 1091 (9th Cir.2001); <i>Sacko,</i> 247 F.3d at 24.</p>\n<p>The appellant offers no compelling rejoinder to this long line of well-reasoned precedents. He does, however, suggest that his situation is distinguishable. The distinction, he says, is that his case is \"once removed\" from the potentially harmful conduct because he himself was not sexually active in the commission of any of the charged offenses but, rather, merely facilitated others' sexual contact with the minor. The suggestion that this distinction matters is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p>In our view, the fact that the appellant was not personally intimate with the minor during the commission of any of the section 2423(a) offenses does nothing to diminish the risk that force might be used in carrying out the crime. The appellant's conduct  knowingly transporting the minor for prostitution  necessarily placed the minor in harm's way and led ineluctably to a sex act that typically occurred in close quarters between the minor and an older man unconcerned with her welfare. Thus, the imbalanced power dynamic that influenced our earlier decisions was fully operational here. So were the twin likelihoods that force might be used and that serious physical harm might result.</p>\n<p>To cinch matters, the commercial context  the selling of sex  works against the appellant, not in his favor. It seems self-evident to us that a prostituted child who is exploited in violation of section 2423(a) <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> faces more and greater risks than does a seduced child, including the dual risk of physical abuse by either her pimp or her client. <i>See </i><i>Carter,</i> 266 F.3d at 1091. Viewed from a different angle, the risk of injury present in any prostitution scenario is heightened when the situation involves a minor. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Curtis,</i> 481 F.3d 836, 838 (D.C.Cir.2007). And, finally, exposing a young girl to multiple sex partners obviously adds incrementally to the potential risk of disease. Taking these realities into account, we have no hesitancy in concluding that the appellant's conduct actually <i>increased</i> the level of risk.</p>\n<p>The case law, though scanty, bears out this intuition. In <i>Carter,</i> the Ninth Circuit held that a violation of section 2423(a) constitutes a crime of violence. <i>Carter,</i> 266 F.3d at 1091. The court assessed the statute categorically and determined that a prostituted minor faces the risks of \"contracting a sexually transmitted disease\" and \"assault or physical abuse by the pimp's customers or by the pimp himself.\" <i>Id.</i><sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Similarly, the <i>Curtis</i> court held that the prostitution of a minor in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. § 2C:34-1(b)(3) qualified as a crime of violence for career offender purposes. <i>Curtis,</i> 481 F.3d at 838-39. The court stressed that, in such a situation, a child faces a significant risk of serious physical harm from both pimps and customers. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The appellant has a fallback position. He posits that his offense cannot qualify as a crime of violence because the minor consented to engaging in what he euphemistically terms a \"joint business venture.\" To bolster this thesis, he asserts that he believed that the minor was over eighteen during a substantial portion of the time in question.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>We find this thesis unconvincing. Even if the minor had factually consented, that consent would not have been legally valid. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, § 23; <i>Commonwealth v. Miller,</i> 385 Mass. 521, 432 N.E.2d 463, 464 (Mass.1982). In all events, factual consent would not eliminate the potential risks that confronted the child. <i>See </i><i>Aguiar v. Gonzales,</i> 438 F.3d 86, 90-91 (1st Cir.2006) (finding that the risks to a minor, unable to give legal consent, are not diminished by factual consent). Just as consent is not a defense to a prosecution under section 2423(a), <i>see </i><i>United States v. Lowe,</i> 145 F.3d 45, 52 (1st Cir.1998), so too consent in this context does not reconfigure the risk-of-harm calculus.</p>\n<p>Up until April 16, 2008, we could have ended our analysis at this juncture. On that date, however, the Supreme Court handed down its decision in <i>Begay v. United States,</i> 553 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 1587, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008). There  well after briefing and submission of this appeal  the Court effectively charted a new course in interpreting the critical violent felony definition of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B). For both prudential and precedential reasons, we have read that statute and the almost parallel guidelines language at issue here as being <i>in pari passu. See supra</i> note 3. If that identity is to be altered, it cannot be done by this panel.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> We briefly limn the contours of the <i>Begay</i> decision. The question there was whether Begay's offense  driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI)  constituted a violent felony. The Court answered this question in the negative because DUI offenses are more comparable to crimes in \"which the offender need not have had any criminal intent at all.\" <i>Begay,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 1587 (emphasizing that \"the conduct for which the drunk driver is convicted ... need not be purposeful or deliberate\").</p>\n<p>The main substantive change that <i>Begay</i> wrought is that the Court now requires us to focus not only on the degree of risk of harm posed by a particular crime but also on whether that crime is similar \"in kind\" to the enumerated offenses of arson, burglary, extortion, and the like. <i>Id.</i> at 1585. To help answer this \"in kind\" query, the <i>Begay</i> Court adopted a new touchstone: asking whether the crime involves purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct. <i>Id.</i> at 1586-87.</p>\n<p>Because a new test is introduced and because the Court's decision is itself close, it is hard to be absolutely certain how a majority of the Justices would apply the test to the crime at issue here  a crime that falls neither within the safe harbor of offenses with limited scienter requirements and uncertain consequences (like DUI, <i>see id.</i> at 1587), nor among those that have deliberate violence as a necessary element or even as an almost inevitable concomitant. Adjectives like \"purposeful\" and \"aggressive\" denote qualities that are ineluctably manifested in degree and appear in different combinations;<sup>[7]</sup> they are, therefore, imprecise aids.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding this new gloss, a strong argument exists for treating the transport of a minor for prostitution as a violent crime. Unlike DUI, the crime is purposeful and the perpetrator is aware of the risks that the prostituted minor will face. The defendant may well use force to ensure the minor's compliance; but it is even more likely, and fully foreseeable, that the \"clients\" will endanger the minor's safety in various ways. As we have explained, the crime is implicitly (and sometimes explicitly) aggressive, and coercion of the minor is virtually inherent.</p>\n<p>Admittedly, the case at hand is different in one respect from most crimes of violence: in other cases, the defendant himself is usually the agent of the violence (real or potential). Here, however, the violence often will be carried out by third parties. But since the risk of harm is so substantial and so easily foreseen by the defendant, we discern no basis for distinction. Surely, tying a man to the railroad tracks is an act of violence even though the oncoming train is the instrument through which inevitable harm is administered.</p>\n<p>We need go no further. Only time and future cases can tell how the Supreme Court will develop its new definition.<sup>[8]</sup> But delivering a minor for prostitution appears to us fairly readily to fall within both the Court's trio of adjectives and Congress's harm-based statutory definition (incorporated in the relevant guideline provision). <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> Indeed, it is surpassingly difficult to see how burglary could be treated as a violent crime yet child trafficking exempted.</p>\n<p>For the reasons elucidated above, we hold that a violation of section 2423(a) involves purposeful and aggressive conduct that presents serious potential risks of physical injury. The commission of that offense therefore categorically constitutes a crime of violence within the purview of USSG § 4B1.2(a).</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The other eight counts variously charged the appellant with transporting an individual interstate to engage in prostitution in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2421; inducing travel to engage in prostitution in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2422(a); trafficking children for sex in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591; and conspiring in sex trafficking and in inducing interstate travel for the purpose of prostitution in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371.</p>\n<p>[2]  In formulating the sentence, the court afforded the appellant a credit for acceptance of responsibility. <i>See</i> USSG § 3E1.1.</p>\n<p>[3]  To be sure, the issue in <i>Taylor</i> was whether a predicate offense constituted a \"violent felony\" under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. § 924(e). Given the similarity between the ACCA's definition of \"violent felony\" and the definition of \"crime of violence\" contained in the pertinent guideline provision, we previously have taken the position that authority interpreting one phrase is generally persuasive when interpreting the other. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Winter,</i> 22 F.3d 15, 18 n. 3 (1st Cir. 1994).</p>\n<p>[4]  The government contends that violations of some of the other statutes of conviction are sufficient to trigger the career offender provision. It is not necessary for us to address that ambitious contention.</p>\n<p>[5]  The appellant seeks to distinguish <i>Carter</i> on the facts. This effort is unavailing for it ignores the categorical nature of the approach that the crime of violence inquiry demands. <i>See </i><i>Taylor,</i> 495 U.S. at 600-02, 110 S.Ct. 2143.</p>\n<p>[6]  The appellant's subjective belief is beside the point. Moreover, the significance of his purported lack of knowledge is undercut by the fact that two of his four section 2423(a) violations occurred after the appellant admittedly learned how old she was.</p>\n<p>[7]  For example, even the crimes enumerated by Congress in the ACCA and treated as examples satisfy these requirements only in some measure. Burglary, for instance, can be described as purposeful but not, at least in most instances, as purposely violent or necessarily aggressive. Drug trafficking crimes similarly involve purposeful conduct but are only sometimes violent or aggressive.</p>\n<p>[8]  Indeed, the Court has just agreed to review the question of classifying escape crimes. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Chambers,</i> 473 F.3d 724 (7th Cir.2007), <i>cert. granted,</i> 553 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 2046, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2008).</p>\n\n</div>",

The guidelines define a crime of violence as:</p>\n<blockquote>[A]ny offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or <i>otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p>USSG § 4B1.2(a) (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p>Here, none of the offenses of conviction explicitly includes an element of force. By the same token, none of them falls within the statutory enumeration of specified crimes. Consequently, we concentrate our attention on the underscored statutory language  variously known as the \"residual clause\" or the \"otherwise clause\"  and inquire whether any of the offenses of conviction presents \"a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\"</p>\n<p>In pursuing this inquiry, we must follow a two-step approach. <i>See </i><i>Taylor v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112435\"><a href=\"/opinion/112435/taylor-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span>, 600-02, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112435\"><a href=\"/opinion/112435/taylor-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2143</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112435\"><a href=\"/opinion/112435/taylor-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">607</span></a></span> (1990).<sup>[3]</sup> That approach pertains both when a court is attempting to characterize a predicate offense and when a court is attempting to characterize a current offense. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Bell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584510\"><a href=\"/opinion/584510/united-states-v-richard-harmon-bell/\"><span class=\"volume\">966</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">703</span></a></span>, 706 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n<p>This two-step approach is categorical: the court's analysis is \"restricted to an examination of how the legislature has defined the crime, without any concomitant inquiry into the details of defendant's actual criminal conduct.\" <i>United States v. Winter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195327\"><a href=\"/opinion/195327/united-states-v-winter/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 18 (1st Cir. 1994); <i>see </i><i>Taylor,</i> 495 U.S. at 600, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112435\"><a href=\"/opinion/112435/taylor-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2143</span></a></span>. If the court determines that a violation of the statute in question necessarily involves each and every element of a violent crime, then the offense is deemed a crime of violence and the inquiry is at an end. <i>See </i><i>Eirby,</i> 515 F.3d at 37; <i>Winter,</i> 22 F.3d at 18.</p>\n<p>If, however, the statute's text is broad enough to criminalize both violent and non-violent conduct, the court must embark on the second step of the <i>Taylor</i> pavane. In so doing, it may not undertake a mini-trial of a putative predicate offense, but it may inspect the record of conviction in order to determine whether a defendant was actually charged with an offense that involved violent or potentially violent conduct. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Richards,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795168\"><a href=\"/opinion/795168/united-states-v-arnold-richards-iii/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">260</span></a></span>, 263 (1st Cir.2006). To satisfy that criterion \"the jury must have been required to find (or, in a guilty plea context, the defendant necessarily must have admitted) all the elements of a violent felony.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>To trigger the career offender enhancement, it is only necessary that one of the twelve offenses of conviction qualifies as a crime of violence. For that reason, we need look no further than the convictions under 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a)  and we need not go past the first step in the <i>Taylor</i> pavane.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> We begin our analysis with the penalty involved in the offense: those who violate section 2423(a) are subject to a term of imprisonment of \"not less than 10 years or for life.\" <i>Id.</i> Thus, the level of punishment easily satisfies the requirement that, to qualify as a crime of violence, an offense must be punishable by incarceration for more than one year. <i>See</i> USSG § 4B1.2(a).</p>\n<p>We move next to risk of harm. In this circuit, it is common ground that most \"indecent sexual contact crimes <i>perpetrated by adults</i> against children categorically present a serious potential risk of physical injury.\" <i>United States v. Cadieux,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202903\"><a href=\"/opinion/202903/united-states-v-cadieux/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, 45 (1st Cir.2007) (emphasis in original); <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Eirby,</i> 515 F.3d at 38 (applying principle to a fourteen- or fifteen-year-old girl); <i>United States v.

This risk arises because such offenses \"typically occur in close quarters, and are generally perpetrated by an adult upon a victim who is not only smaller, weaker, and less experienced, but is also generally susceptible to acceding to the coercive power of adult authority figures.\" <i>Sherwood,</i> 156 F.3d at 221 (citing <i>United States v. Velazquez-Overa,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"10694\"><a href=\"/opinion/10694/united-states-v-velazquez-overa/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">418</span></a></span>, 422 (5th Cir.1996)). Moreover, when the illicit activity involves sexual intercourse, it poses an additional risk of harm due to the possible transmission of social or venereal diseases. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Carter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775083\"><a href=\"/opinion/775083/united-states-v-murphy-wayman-carter-aka-scottie-pimpin/\"><span class=\"volume\">266</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1089</span></a></span>, 1091 (9th Cir.2001); <i>Sacko,</i> 247 F.3d at 24.</p>\n<p>The appellant offers no compelling rejoinder to this long line of well-reasoned precedents. He does, however, suggest that his situation is distinguishable. The distinction, he says, is that his case is \"once removed\" from the potentially harmful conduct because he himself was not sexually active in the commission of any of the charged offenses but, rather, merely facilitated others' sexual contact with the minor. The suggestion that this distinction matters is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p>In our view, the fact that the appellant was not personally intimate with the minor during the commission of any of the section 2423(a) offenses does nothing to diminish the risk that force might be used in carrying out the crime. The appellant's conduct  knowingly transporting the minor for prostitution  necessarily placed the minor in harm's way and led ineluctably to a sex act that typically occurred in close quarters between the minor and an older man unconcerned with her welfare. Thus, the imbalanced power dynamic that influenced our earlier decisions was fully operational here. So were the twin likelihoods that force might be used and that serious physical harm might result.</p>\n<p>To cinch matters, the commercial context  the selling of sex  works against the appellant, not in his favor. It seems self-evident to us that a prostituted child who is exploited in violation of section 2423(a) <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> faces more and greater risks than does a seduced child, including the dual risk of physical abuse by either her pimp or her client. <i>See </i><i>Carter,</i> 266 F.3d at 1091. Viewed from a different angle, the risk of injury present in any prostitution scenario is heightened when the situation involves a minor. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Curtis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186876\"><a href=\"/opinion/186876/united-states-v-curtis-carlos/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">836</span></a></span>, 838 (D.C.Cir.2007). And, finally, exposing a young girl to multiple sex partners obviously adds incrementally to the potential risk of disease. Taking these realities into account, we have no hesitancy in concluding that the appellant's conduct actually <i>increased</i> the level of risk.</p>\n<p>The case law, though scanty, bears out this intuition. In <i>Carter,</i> the Ninth Circuit held that a violation of section 2423(a) constitutes a crime of violence. <i>Carter,</i> 266 F.3d at 1091. The court assessed the statute categorically and determined that a prostituted minor faces the risks of \"contracting a sexually transmitted disease\" and \"assault or physical abuse by the pimp's customers or by the pimp himself.\" <i>Id.</i><sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Similarly, the <i>Curtis</i> court held that the prostitution of a minor in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. § 2C:34-1(b)(3) qualified as a crime of violence for career offender purposes. <i>Curtis,</i> 481 F.3d at 838-39. The court stressed that, in such a situation, a child faces a significant risk of serious physical harm from both pimps and customers. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The appellant has a fallback position. He posits that his offense cannot qualify as a crime of violence because the minor consented to engaging in what he euphemistically terms a \"joint business venture.\" To bolster this thesis, he asserts that he believed that the minor was over eighteen during a substantial portion of the time in question.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>We find this thesis unconvincing. Even if the minor had factually consented, that consent would not have been legally valid. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, § 23; <i>Commonwealth v. Miller,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">385</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">521</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">463</span></span>, 464 (Mass.1982). In all events, factual consent would not eliminate the potential risks that confronted the child. <i>See </i><i>Aguiar v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793346\"><a href=\"/opinion/793346/pedro-aguiar-v-alberto-r-gonzales-united-states-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span>, 90-91 (1st Cir.2006) (finding that the risks to a minor, unable to give legal consent, are not diminished by factual consent). Just as consent is not a defense to a prosecution under section 2423(a), <i>see </i><i>United States v. Lowe,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"754636\"><a href=\"/opinion/754636/united-states-v-paul-e-lowe/\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 52 (1st Cir.1998), so too consent in this context does not reconfigure the risk-of-harm calculus.</p>\n<p>Up until April 16, 2008, we could have ended our analysis at this juncture. On that date, however, the Supreme Court handed down its decision in <i>Begay v. United States,</i> 553 U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145815\"><a href=\"/opinion/145815/begay-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1581</span></a></span>, 1587, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145815\"><a href=\"/opinion/145815/begay-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">490</span></a></span> (2008). There  well after briefing and submission of this appeal  the Court effectively charted a new course in interpreting the critical violent felony definition of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B). For both prudential and precedential reasons, we have read that statute and the almost parallel guidelines language at issue here as being <i>in pari passu. See supra</i> note 3. If that identity is to be altered, it cannot be done by this panel.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> We briefly limn the contours of the <i>Begay</i> decision. The question there was whether Begay's offense  driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI)  constituted a violent felony. The Court answered this question in the negative because DUI offenses are more comparable to crimes in \"which the offender need not have had any criminal intent at all.\" <i>Begay,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 1587 (emphasizing that \"the conduct for which the drunk driver is convicted ... need not be purposeful or deliberate\").</p>\n<p>The main substantive change that <i>Begay</i> wrought is that the Court now requires us to focus not only on the degree of risk of harm posed by a particular crime but also on whether that crime is similar \"in kind\" to the enumerated offenses of arson, burglary, extortion, and the like. <i>Id.</i> at 1585. To help answer this \"in kind\" query, the <i>Begay</i> Court adopted a new touchstone: asking whether the crime involves purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct. <i>Id.</i> at 1586-87.</p>\n<p>Because a new test is introduced and because the Court's decision is itself close, it is hard to be absolutely certain how a majority of the Justices would apply the test to the crime at issue here  a crime that falls neither within the safe harbor of offenses with limited scienter requirements and uncertain consequences (like DUI, <i>see id.</i> at 1587), nor among those that have deliberate violence as a necessary element or even as an almost inevitable concomitant. Adjectives like \"purposeful\" and \"aggressive\" denote qualities that are ineluctably manifested in degree and appear in different combinations;<sup>[7]</sup> they are, therefore, imprecise aids.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding this new gloss, a strong argument exists for treating the transport of a minor for prostitution as a violent crime. Unlike DUI, the crime is purposeful and the perpetrator is aware of the risks that the prostituted minor will face. The defendant may well use force to ensure the minor's compliance; but it is even more likely, and fully foreseeable, that the \"clients\" will endanger the minor's safety in various ways. As we have explained, the crime is implicitly (and sometimes explicitly) aggressive, and coercion of the minor is virtually inherent.</p>\n<p>Admittedly, the case at hand is different in one respect from most crimes of violence: in other cases, the defendant himself is usually the agent of the violence (real or potential). Here, however, the violence often will be carried out by third parties. But since the risk of harm is so substantial and so easily foreseen by the defendant, we discern no basis for distinction. Surely, tying a man to the railroad tracks is an act of violence even though the oncoming train is the instrument through which inevitable harm is administered.</p>\n<p>We need go no further. Only time and future cases can tell how the Supreme Court will develop its new definition.<sup>[8]</sup> But delivering a minor for prostitution appears to us fairly readily to fall within both the Court's trio of adjectives and Congress's harm-based statutory definition (incorporated in the relevant guideline provision). <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> Indeed, it is surpassingly difficult to see how burglary could be treated as a violent crime yet child trafficking exempted.</p>\n<p>For the reasons elucidated above, we hold that a violation of section 2423(a) involves purposeful and aggressive conduct that presents serious potential risks of physical injury. The commission of that offense therefore categorically constitutes a crime of violence within the purview of USSG § 4B1.2(a).</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The other eight counts variously charged the appellant with transporting an individual interstate to engage in prostitution in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2421; inducing travel to engage in prostitution in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2422(a); trafficking children for sex in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591; and conspiring in sex trafficking and in inducing interstate travel for the purpose of prostitution in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371.</p>\n<p>[2]  In formulating the sentence, the court afforded the appellant a credit for acceptance of responsibility. <i>See</i> USSG § 3E1.1.</p>\n<p>[3]  To be sure, the issue in <i>Taylor</i> was whether a predicate offense constituted a \"violent felony\" under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. § 924(e). Given the similarity between the ACCA's definition of \"violent felony\" and the definition of \"crime of violence\" contained in the pertinent guideline provision, we previously have taken the position that authority interpreting one phrase is generally persuasive when interpreting the other. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Winter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195327\"><a href=\"/opinion/195327/united-states-v-winter/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 18 n. 3 (1st Cir. 1994).</p>\n<p>[4]  The government contends that violations of some of the other statutes of conviction are sufficient to trigger the career offender provision. It is not necessary for us to address that ambitious contention.</p>\n<p>[5]  The appellant seeks to distinguish <i>Carter</i> on the facts. This effort is unavailing for it ignores the categorical nature of the approach that the crime of violence inquiry demands. <i>See </i><i>Taylor,</i> 495 U.S. at 600-02, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112435\"><a href=\"/opinion/112435/taylor-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2143</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>[6]  The appellant's subjective belief is beside the point. Moreover, the significance of his purported lack of knowledge is undercut by the fact that two of his four section 2423(a) violations occurred after the appellant admittedly learned how old she was.</p>\n<p>[7]  For example, even the crimes enumerated by Congress in the ACCA and treated as examples satisfy these requirements only in some measure. Burglary, for instance, can be described as purposeful but not, at least in most instances, as purposely violent or necessarily aggressive. Drug trafficking crimes similarly involve purposeful conduct but are only sometimes violent or aggressive.</p>\n<p>[8]  Indeed, the Court has just agreed to review the question of classifying escape crimes. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Chambers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796473\"><a href=\"/opinion/796473/united-states-v-deondery-chambers/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">724</span></a></span> (7th Cir.2007), <i>cert. granted,</i> 553 U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
