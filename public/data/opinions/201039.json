Vincent Santoni appeals from the\n\ndistrict   court's    grant    of    summary         judgment         in   favor    of   the\n\ndefendants on his claims against Michael Desrosiers and John E.\n\nPotter, Postmaster General and CEO of the United States Postal\n\nService (USPS).1 Santoni, a former postmaster of Solon, Maine, was\n\narrested   for    indecent     exposure         by    a       local    deputy      sheriff.\n\nDesrosiers,   a   postal     inspector      who      had       sworn   out   the     arrest\n\nwarrant, accompanied the deputy sheriff and participated in the\n\narrest.    Santoni subsequently filed an 18-count complaint against\n\nDesrosiers,   the    USPS,    and    the    sheriff           and   deputy   sheriff      of\n\nSomerset    County,       Maine,     asserting            a    variety       of     federal\n\nconstitutional      and   state     law    claims         in    connection        with   the\n\nallegedly unlawful arrest.           The district court granted summary\n\njudgment in favor of the defendants on all counts. Santoni appeals\n\nfrom the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the\n\nfederal defendants2 on his Fourth Amendment claim under Bivens v.\n\nSix Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S.\n\n388 (1971), and his claims of unlawful arrest, assault, battery,\n\nand false imprisonment under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Both parties treat the claims against named defendant John E.\nPotter as claims against the USPS. For simplicity, we refer to\nthis party throughout this opinion as the USPS.\n     2\n      Santoni filed this appeal against all of the original parties\nbut expressly abandoned his claims against the state defendants in\nhis brief to this court.\n\n                                          -2-\n\fU.S.C. § § 1346(b), 2671-2680.          We affirm the decision of the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n                                  I.\n\n           On August 2, 1999, Michael Desrosiers, a postal inspector\n\nfor the United States Postal Service, learned that the USPS had\n\nreceived a complaint concerning Vincent Santoni, the postmaster of\n\nSolon, Maine.     The complaint alleged that Santoni had exposed\n\nhimself to Heather M., a 15-year-old girl who resided in Solon.        On\n\nAugust 13, 1999, Desrosiers' supervisor instructed him to conduct\n\nan immediate investigation.\n\n           On August 16, 1999, Desrosiers interviewed Heather, who\n\nsaid that around 2 p.m. on July 15, 1999, she was riding her\n\nbicycle across a bridge near the post office in Solon when she\n\nheard someone call her name.          She turned around and recognized\n\nSantoni, whom she knew, standing by the edge of the water with his\n\npants down to his knees and both of his hands holding his exposed\n\npenis.   Heather told Desrosiers that for several years Santoni had\n\nbeen making inappropriate sexual comments and gestures to her\n\nduring her visits to the Solon post office.       Heather's mother, who\n\nattended   the    interview,   said     that   Santoni   had   also   made\n\ninappropriate comments to her and to other women.              Desrosiers\n\nprepared a type-written statement based on the interview, which\n\nHeather reviewed and signed.     Over the next few weeks, Desrosiers\n\ninterviewed other female customers of the Solon post office who\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\freported that Santoni had touched them or made inappropriate\n\ncomments while he was at work at the post office.\n\n            On September 8, 1999, Desrosiers discussed the results of\n\nhis   investigation     with    Andrew   Benson,   an    Assistant   District\n\nAttorney (ADA) for Somerset County, Maine.              At Benson's request,\n\nDesrosiers arranged for a fellow postal inspector, who was also a\n\npolygraph   examiner,    to    administer   a   polygraph    examination   of\n\nHeather.    After receiving the results of the test, which Heather\n\npassed, Desrosiers again discussed the case with ADA Benson.               At\n\nthe conclusion of that discussion, the DA's Office authorized the\n\nprosecution of Santoni on the criminal charge of indecent conduct,\n\na Class E misdemeanor under 17A Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 854.\n\n            On October 5, 1999, Desrosiers appeared before the clerk\n\nof the state district court in Skowhegan, Maine, to present a\n\nrequest for a criminal complaint and a warrant for Santoni’s\n\narrest.     He also submitted a supporting affidavit identifying\n\nDesrosiers as a postal inspector and stating that he had probable\n\ncause to believe that Santoni had committed the state law offense\n\nof indecent conduct, in violation of 17A Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 854.\n\nThe affidavit provided details about Desrosiers' interview with\n\nHeather and stated that she had passed a polygraph examination.\n\nThe court clerk issued         a criminal complaint against Santoni for\n\nviolating the indecent conduct statute and a corresponding warrant\n\nfor his arrest.       At Desrosiers' request, Randy Wing, a deputy\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fsheriff for Somerset County, accompanied Desrosiers to Santoni's\n\nhome, where Santoni was arrested.            On April 21, 2000, Santoni was\n\ntried in the Skowhegan District Court and was acquitted after the\n\ncourt determined that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a\n\nconviction for indecent conduct.3\n\n             On January 3, 2002, Santoni filed an 18-count complaint\n\nin the United States District Court for the District of Maine\n\nagainst the USPS, Desrosiers, Wing, and Somerset County Sheriff\n\nBarry DeLong.     He sued the USPS pursuant to the FTCA, 18 U.S.C. §\n\n§ 1346, 2671 et seq., claiming that it was liable to him for\n\nunlawful arrest, abuse of process, malicious prosecution, false\n\nimprisonment, intentional and/or negligent infliction of emotional\n\ndistress, assault, battery, invasion of privacy, and negligent\n\nsupervision and training.           He sued Desrosiers in his individual\n\ncapacity, seeking damages for violations of the First, Fourth, and\n\nFifth Amendments of the United States Constitution pursuant to\n\nBivens,    403   U.S.   at   388.     Santoni    brought   analogous   Fourth\n\nAmendment claims against Wing and DeLong pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1983.     He further claimed that all four defendants had engaged in\n\na civil conspiracy to violate his federal and state civil rights.\n\n     3\n      Heather had stated in her sworn statement and in a pre-trial\ninterview with ADA Mitchell that she had viewed Santoni's genitals\non July 15. However, during cross examination, she acknowledged\nthat she had not been able to see Santoni's penis because of the\nplacement of his hands around it. The district court found that\nHeather's testimony failed to satisfy 17A Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. §\n854, which prohibits a person from knowingly exposing his or her\ngenitals.\n\n                                       -5-\n\f            On April 8, 2002, Desrosiers and the USPS, the federal\n\ndefendants, moved to dismiss or for summary judgment on all of\n\nSantoni's federal claims.        The district court determined that no\n\nconstitutional rights had been violated and that, in any event,\n\nDesrosiers    was   protected    from    liability     on   Santoni's   Fourth\n\nAmendment claim by the doctrine of qualified immunity. Although it\n\nfound that Santoni's FTCA claims against the USPS did not fall\n\nwithin the FTCA's discretionary function exception, it held that\n\nthe claims failed on their merits.           Therefore, the district court\n\ngranted summary judgment in favor of Desrosiers and the USPS and\n\ndismissed Santoni’s claims against them.           After the district court\n\ngranted summary judgment for the federal defendants, the lawsuit\n\nproceeded against DeLong and Wing.           Following discovery, the state\n\ndefendants filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted.\n\nSantoni filed this appeal against all of the original defendants\n\nbut has chosen not to prosecute his claims against the state\n\ndefendants.\n\n                                 II.\n\n            On appeal, Santoni challenges the district court's grant\n\nof summary judgment in favor of Desrosiers on Santoni's Bivens\n\nclaim.   He argues that because Desrosiers lacked authority under\n\nstate or federal law to make an arrest for a Class E state law\n\ncrime, the arrest of Santoni constituted an unreasonable seizure in\n\nviolation    of   the   Fourth   Amendment.       He   further   claims   that\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fDesrosiers is not entitled to qualified immunity.                  In addition,\n\nSantoni     argues   that       because    the    district     court   improperly\n\ndetermined that the arrest was lawful, it erred in granting summary\n\njudgment in favor of the USPS on Santoni's FTCA claims.                We address\n\neach of these arguments in turn.\n\nA.   Standard of Review\n\n            We review the district court's grant of summary judgment\n\nde novo.     Wojcik v. Mass. State Lottery Comm'n, 300 F.3d 92, 98\n\n(1st Cir.       2002).     Summary     judgment    is    appropriate   where   the\n\nevidence shows that \"there is no genuine issue as to any material\n\nfact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter\n\nof law.\"    Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).         A fact is \"material\" if it \"might\n\naffect    the    outcome   of    the   suit\"     under   the   applicable   legal\n\nstandard.       Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248\n\n(1986).     A factual issue is \"genuine\" only \"if a reasonable jury\n\ncould resolve it in favor of either party.\" Basic Controlex Corp.,\n\nInc. v. Klockner Moeller Corp., 202 F.3d 450, 453 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\nIn deciding whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, we\n\nconstrue the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving\n\nparty.     Flowers v. Fiore, 359 F.3d 24, 29 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nB.   Bivens Claim Against Desrosiers\n\n     1.    Santoni's Arrest\n\n     Under Bivens, a person may sue a federal official in his or\n\nher individual capacity for damages arising out of a constitutional\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fviolation committed under color of federal law.            See Bivens, 403\n\nU.S. at 389; Aversa v. United States 99 F.3d 1200, 1213 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).     Relying on Bivens, Santoni claims that because Desrosiers\n\nhad   no   legal   authority   to   make   an   arrest   for   a   state   law\n\nmisdemeanor, his arrest of Santoni constituted an unreasonable\n\nseizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment.4\n\n      We have not resolved whether an arresting officer's lack of\n\nauthority under state or federal law to conduct an otherwise\n\nconstitutionally valid arrest constitutes an unreasonable seizure\n\nunder the Fourth Amendment.         The circuits are divided on this\n\nissue. Compare Malone v. County of Suffolk, 968 F.2d 1480, 1482-83\n\n(2d Cir. 1992) (whether officers have valid authority to arrest\n\npursuant to state law affects constitutionality of the arrest);\n\nRoss v. Neff, 905 F.2d 1349, 1353-54 (10th Cir. 1990) (arrest\n\nexecuted outside of the officer's jurisdiction violates the Fourth\n\nAmendment and gives rise to a potential § 1983 action); and United\n\nStates v. Trigg, 878 F.2d 1037, 1041 (7th Cir. 1989) (custodial\n\narrest is constitutional if arresting officer had probable cause\n\nand authority under state or municipal law to effect a custodial\n\narrest for the particular offense) with United States v. Bell, 54\n\nF.3d 502, 504 (8th Cir. 1995); (\"[W]e do not think Fourth Amendment\n\nanalysis requires reference to an arrest's legality under state\n\n      4\n      The Fourth Amendment provides: \"The right of the people to be\nsecure in their persons . . . against unreasonable searches and\nseizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue but\nupon probable cause . . . .\" U.S. Const. Amdt. 4.\n\n                                    -8-\n\flaw.\"); Fields v. City of South Houston, 922 F.2d 1183, 1189 (5th\n\nCir. 1991) (holding that there is no § 1983 cause of action for\n\nfalse arrest unless the arresting officer lacked probable cause);\n\nand Street v. Surdyka, 492 F.2d 368, 372-73 (4th Cir. 1974) (same).\n\nWe do not reach this constitutional question5 because we conclude\n\nthat Desrosiers was authorized to swear out the criminal complaint\n\nand receive the complaint and warrant for Santoni's arrest, and\n\nthat the warrant was executed under the lawful authority of Deputy\n\nSheriff Wing.\n\n     Under federal law, the United States Postal Service has\n\nauthority   \"to   investigate   postal   offenses   and   civil   matters\n\nrelating to the Postal Service.\"         39 U.S.C. § 404(a)(7).      This\n\nauthority is primarily exercised through the Postal Inspection\n\nService, which is charged with \"[e]nforcing laws related to the\n\nPostal Service, the mails, other postal offenses and other laws of\n\nthe United States.\"    39 C.F.R. § 224.3(b)(2).\n\n     The federal arrest powers of postal inspectors, however, are\n\nlimited and specifically defined, including the authority to \"serve\n\nwarrants and subpoenas issued under the authority of the United\n\nStates\" and to make certain warrantless arrests \"for offenses\n\n\n     5\n      \"[P]rior to reaching any constitutional questions, federal\ncourts must consider nonconstitutional grounds for decision.\" Gulf\nOil Co. v. Bernard, 452 U.S. 89, 99 (1981); see also United States\nv. Maldonado, 356 F.3d 130, 137 (1st Cir. 2004) (avoiding a\nconstitutional question about the relevance of subjective intent to\nFourth Amendment analysis of an administrative search where the\nappellant's subjective intent argument \"fail[ed] on its facts\").\n\n                                  -9-\n\fagainst the United States.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3061(a); see also 39 C.F.R.\n\n§ 233.1(a). Postal inspectors are not authorized under federal law\n\nto execute a warrant or make an arrest for a state law offense.\n\nSee United States v. Univerzagt, 424 F.2d 396, 398 n.1 (8th Cir.\n\n1970) (\"Postal inspectors under 18 U.S.C.A. § 3061 are given power\n\nto make arrests for postal offenses upon probable cause but are\n\ngiven no power to make arrests for state offenses by either state\n\nor federal statute.\").   Similarly, while Maine law permits some\n\nspecifically designated \"federal officers\" to make arrests to\n\nenforce state law in certain situations, postal inspectors are not\n\namong these officers.    25 Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 1502-A.    Thus,\n\nDesrosiers did not have authority under state or federal law to\n\nmake an arrest for a violation of state law.\n\n     Nonetheless, the district court concluded that although Maine\n\nlaw did not confer upon Desrosiers authority to arrest Santoni, it\n\ndid authorize him to swear out a warrant for Santoni's arrest,\n\neither in his capacity as a law enforcement official or as a\n\nprivate citizen acting with the approval of the district attorney's\n\noffice.   It further held that the execution of the warrant was\n\nlawful because Desrosiers participated in the arrest as a private\n\ncitizen and was assisted by Deputy Sheriff Wing, who had an\n\naffirmative duty to arrest Santoni.    Santoni challenges both of\n\nthese determinations.\n\n\n\n\n                               -10-\n\f          a.   Swearing Out the Criminal Complaint\n\n     In accordance with Maine law, a Maine district court clerk\n\nmay, in the absence or unavailability of a justice of the peace or\n\na prosecuting attorney or any of his assistants, prepare and draft\n\na misdemeanor criminal complaint \"upon the request of any law\n\nenforcement officer.\"   15 Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 708.    While the\n\nstatute does not define the phrase \"law enforcement officer,\" the\n\ndistrict court interpreted it to include postal inspectors.     We\n\nagree.\n\n     When interpreting a statute under Maine law, words and phrases\n\nare to be construed in accordance with \"the plain meaning of the\n\nenactment.\"    1 Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 72.   Applying this rule of\n\nstatutory construction to 15 Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 708, we find\n\nthat \"any\" law enforcement officer includes every kind of law\n\nenforcement officer, regardless of whether or not the officer is\n\nstatutorily authorized to enforce state law.     Moreover, we have\n\nregularly recognized postal inspectors as law enforcement officers.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Carrillo Figueroa, 34 F.3d 33, 43 (1st\n\nCir. 2002) (for sentence enhancement purposes, defendant should\n\nhave known that postal inspector was a “law enforcement officer”);\n\nsee also Cosme v. Henderson, 287 F.3d 152, 156 (2d Cir. 2002)\n\n(Plaintiff “applied for a position as a postal inspector, a highly\n\ncompetitive law enforcement position.”); Stout v. Potter, 276 F.3d\n\n\n\n\n                               -11-\n\f1118, 1121 (9th Cir. 2002) (The Postal Inspection Service is “the\n\nlaw enforcement branch of the United States Postal Service.”).\n\n     Santoni argues that the phrase “law enforcement officers” as\n\nused in 15 Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 708 does not include postal\n\ninspectors because postal inspectors are not among those federal\n\nlaw enforcement officials vested with the \"power to enforce state\n\nlaw\" under 25 Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 1502-A.   However, 15 Me. Rev.\n\nStat. Ann. § 708 does not limit authority to swear out a criminal\n\ncomplaint to state law enforcement officers and federal officers\n\nwho are specifically empowered to enforce state law.   Nor does 25\n\nMe. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 1502-A place any limitations on the kinds of\n\nofficers who may swear out complaints.   Therefore, we agree with\n\nthe district court that the phrase \"any law enforcement officer\"\n\ndoes not preclude postal officials from swearing out criminal\n\ncomplaints.6\n\n\n\n\n     6\n      Because we conclude that Desrosiers was a law enforcement\nofficer for the purposes of 15 Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 708, we do not\nconsider the district court's alternative holding that the court\nclerk properly issued the complaint to Desrosiers in his capacity\nas a private citizen because the district attorney's office\napproved the prosecution.     See 15 Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 708\n(providing that in the absence or unavailability of a justice of\nthe peace or prosecuting attorney, a court clerk may issue a\ncomplaint to a person who is not a law enforcement officer for a\nnon-felony offense \"with the approval of the Attorney General or\nhis designee\").\n\n\n                               -12-\n\f            b.      Executing the Arrest Warrant\n\n       Santoni also argues, however, that even if Desrosiers was\n\nauthorized to swear out and receive the complaint, he had no\n\nauthority to carry out the arrest of Santoni.                      Once an arrest\n\nwarrant is issued, only an \"officer authorized by law\" may execute\n\nthat   warrant.      Me.     R.   Crim.     P.   4(c)(1).     As    noted,    postal\n\ninspectors are not among those officers authorized under Maine law\n\nto execute arrest warrants.               25 Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 1502-A.\n\nSantoni argues that Desrosiers also had no authority to execute the\n\narrest in his capacity as a private citizen.                Therefore, he claims\n\nthat    \"the     district    court's      conclusion     that      Desrosiers   was\n\nauthorized as a private person to arrest Santoni was clearly\n\nerroneous and should be reversed.\"\n\n       Santoni is correct that Maine law does not authorize private\n\ncitizens to make an arrest for a Class E crime not committed in\n\ntheir presence.      See 17-A Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 16; cf. Unverzagt,\n\n424 F.2d at 398 (postal inspector's arrest of individual for\n\ncarrying a concealed weapon was valid under Nebraska law that\n\nauthorized     private      citizens   to    make   an   arrest     for   a   felony\n\ncommitted in their presence).              However, the district court held\n\nthat Santoni's arrest was lawful, not because Desrosiers had state\n\nlaw authority to execute the warrant, but because Deputy Sheriff\n\nWing participated in the arrest.                 In light of Wing's knowing\n\nparticipation in the arrest, the court explained that it \"would be\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\felevating form over substance to conclude that the validity of the\n\narrest depended on which of the two men uttered the words 'You are\n\nunder arrest,' or placed the Plaintiff in handcuffs.\"\n\n     We agree with the district court's conclusion that Santoni's\n\narrest was lawful because it was carried out under Wing's lawful\n\nauthority.    Under Maine law, an arrest warrant \"shall be executed\n\nby any officer authorized by law.\"             Me. R. Crim. P. 4(c)(1).\n\nDeputy Sheriff Wing was clearly authorized – and indeed, required\n\n– by law to arrest Santoni under 15 Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 602,\n\nwhich provides that \"[i]t is the responsibility of all police and\n\nsheriff departments and their officers to use all reasonable\n\nefforts to execute the outstanding arrest warrants of which they\n\nare aware.\"     See also Kane v. Anderson, 509 A.2d 656, 657 (Me.\n\n1986) (concluding that \"the execution of an arrest warrant is a\n\nministerial rather than a discretionary function\"); Carroll v. City\n\nof Portland, 736 A.2d 279, 283 (Me. 1999) (\"[A] ministerial act is\n\nmandatory and requires no personal judgment or choice.\") (emphasis\n\nin original). It is undisputed that Wing accompanied Desrosiers at\n\nDesrosiers'    request    to   Santoni's    residence    where   Santoni   was\n\narrested and    then     transported   by   Wing   and   Desrosiers   to   the\n\nSomerset County Sheriff's Department.          Based on these facts, the\n\ndistrict court appropriately concluded that Wing was aware of the\n\noutstanding arrest warrant and had a legal duty to execute it.\n\nDesrosiers' presence at the arrest, for the purpose of assisting\n\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\fWing in the execution of the warrant, did not render that arrest\n\nunlawful under state law or constitutionally infirm.           Cf.   Wilson\n\nv. Layne, 526 U.S. 603, 614 (1999) (holding that \"it is a violation\n\nof the Fourth Amendment for police to bring members of the media or\n\nother third parties into a home during the execution of a warrant\n\nwhen the presence of third parties in the home was not in aid of\n\nthe execution of the warrant\").\n\n     For the first time on appeal, Santoni argues that summary\n\njudgment was inappropriate because it is reasonable to infer that\n\nWing was not aware of the warrant and therefore had no obligation\n\nto execute it.   This argument relies on statements made by Wing in\n\na deposition taken on January 31, 2003, five months after the entry\n\nof summary judgment in favor of the federal defendants. As Santoni\n\nacknowledges, however, this transcript was not available to the\n\ndistrict court   and therefore is not part of the record on appeal.\n\nMoreover, Santoni never argued below that Wing was unaware of the\n\nwarrant.     Indeed, his complaint suggested that Wing knowingly\n\nparticipated in the arrest, with a reference to the \"illegal arrest\n\nof Santoni by defendants\" and the claim that \"Defendants DeLong and\n\nWing did not have probable cause to arrest Santoni\" (emphasis\n\nadded). Similarly, in his opposition to the defendants' motion for\n\nsummary    judgment,   Santoni   alleged   that   Desrosiers    \"arrested\n\nplaintiff without authority to do so and that the other defendants\n\nknew it was unlawful but agreed to participate\" (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\fBecause Santoni failed to raise below his theory that Wing had no\n\nobligation to arrest Santoni because he did not know about the\n\nwarrant,   this   argument    is   now   procedurally    defaulted.       See\n\nTeamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers Union, Local No. 59\n\nv. Superline Transp. Co., 953 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"If any\n\nprinciple is settled in this circuit, it is that, absent the most\n\nextraordinary circumstances, legal theories not raised squarely in\n\nthe lower court cannot be broached for the first time on appeal.\").\n\n     In sum, Desrosiers had valid authority to swear out the\n\ncriminal complaint and receive the complaint and warrant for\n\nSantoni's arrest, and Wing had valid authority to execute that\n\nwarrant.    Therefore,   we    agree     with   the   district   court   that\n\nSantoni's arrest was lawful under Maine law and that it did not\n\nconstitute an unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment.\n\n     2.    Qualified Immunity\n\n     Because Santoni has not presented a viable constitutional\n\nclaim, we do not consider whether Desrosiers is protected from\n\nliability by qualified immunity. See Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194\n\n201 (2001) (\"If no constitutional right would have been violated\n\nwere the allegations established, there is no necessity for further\n\ninquiries concerning qualified immunity.\"); Flowers v. Fiore, 359\n\nF.3d 24, 34 (1st Cir. 2004) (\"Upon finding that there was no\n\nconstitutional violation, we do not address the issue of qualified\n\nimmunity.\").\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\fC.    FTCA Claims Against the USPS\n\n      We next consider whether the district court erred in granting\n\nsummary judgment for the USPS on Santoni's tort claims of unlawful\n\narrest, assault, battery, and false imprisonment.\n\n      The Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2671 et seq.,\n\nprovides a limited congressional waiver of the sovereign immunity\n\nof the United States for torts committed by federal employees\n\nacting within the scope of their employment.             Under the statute,\n\nthe United States may be held civilly liable \"in the same manner\n\nand   to   the   same   extent   as   a    private   individual   under   like\n\ncircumstances.\"     28 U.S.C. § 2674.         Certain types of intentional\n\ntorts are exempted from the FTCA’s waiver of sovereign immunity,\n\nbut the statute allows claims against the United States for the\n\ntorts of “assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, abuse\n\nof process, or malicious prosecution” arising out of “acts or\n\nomissions of investigative or law enforcement officers of the\n\nUnited States Government.” 28 U.S.C. § 2680(h).\n\n      This waiver of sovereign immunity, however, is subject to a\n\nnumber of statutory exceptions.           See 28 U.S.C. § 2680.   One defense\n\nraised in the proceedings below was the discretionary function\n\nexception, which shields from liability claims “based upon the\n\nexercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\fdiscretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or\n\nan employee of the Government, whether or not the discretion\n\ninvolved be abused.”            28 U.S.C. § 2680(a).            If the discretionary\n\nfunction exception applies, the agency is completely immune from\n\nsuit, and the claim must be dismissed for lack of subject matter\n\njurisdiction.      Kelly v. United States, 924 F.2d 355, 360 (1st Cir.\n\n1991).\n\n      The   district      court    held      that   the    discretionary       function\n\nexception did not preclude consideration of Santoni’s tort claims\n\nagainst     the   USPS    for    alleged     harms    arising      from    Desrosiers’\n\nparticipation in the arrest of Santoni.                   Because Desrosiers acted\n\noutside the scope of his federal authority as a postal inspector\n\nwhen he participated in this arrest (regardless of whether his\n\nconduct was authorized under state law), the court concluded that\n\nthe   discretionary       function      exception     did    not    apply.7      As    we\n\nrecently noted,\"courts have read the Supreme Court's discretionary\n\nfunction     cases   as     denying       protection       to    actions      that    are\n\nunauthorized      because       they   are   unconstitutional,        proscribed      by\n\nstatute, or exceed the scope of an official's authority.\"                        Thames\n\nShipyard & Repair Co. v. United States, 350 F.3d 247, 254-55 (1st\n\nCir. 2003) (collecting cases).                 However, we have not resolved\n\nwhether the discretionary function exception extends to actions\n\n\n      7\n      The USPS does not challenge this determination on appeal;\nindeed, the attorney for the government conceded at oral argument\nthat   the  discretionary   function  exception   does  not   bar\nconsideration of Santoni’s claims.\n\n                                          -18-\n\fthat are otherwise outside the scope of an official's actual\n\nfederal authority, and we need not do so here.    Nor do we address\n\nwhether Desrosiers had implied federal authority to participate in\n\nthe arrest to the limited extent of swearing out the criminal\n\ncomplaint, receiving the arrest warrant, and assisting Wing in the\n\nexecution of that warrant.   See, e.g., id. at 260 (holding that the\n\ndiscretionary function exception applied where the Coast Guard had\n\nimplied statutory authority to order the evacuation of a sinking\n\nship).   Assuming, arguendo, that the USPS is not shielded from\n\nliability by the discretionary function analysis, Santoni’s tort\n\nclaims fail on the merits.\n\n      As noted, under the FTCA, the USPS is liable for the torts of\n\nits agents, \"in the same manner and to the same extent of a private\n\nindividual under like circumstances.\"    28 U.S.C. § 2674.   Because\n\nthe alleged tortious conduct took place in Maine, we look to Maine\n\ntort law in determining the defendant's liability under the FTCA.\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1346(b)(1).\n\n      Santoni's claims of false arrest, false imprisonment, assault,\n\nand battery rely on the premise that Desrosiers acted at least\n\nnegligently by arresting Santoni without any lawful authority to do\n\nso.   Under Maine law, the torts of assault and battery by a law\n\nenforcement officer require either a false arrest or the use of\n\nexcessive force during or after taking an individual into custody.\n\nBale v. Rider, 290 A.2d 359, 360 (Me. 1972).     Similarly, in order\n\nto establish a tort claim of false arrest and false imprisonment\n\n                                -19-\n\f“the    authority    upon   which   [P]laintiff   is   confined   must   be\n\nunlawful.”   Nadeau v. State, 395 A.2d 107, 116 (Me. 1978) (stating\n\nelements of false imprisonment claim); see Jedzierowski v. Jordan,\n\n172 A.2d 636, 637 (Me. 1961) (holding that false arrest is one\n\nmeans of committing false imprisonment).\n\n       As we have already concluded, supra, Santoni was arrested and\n\nconfined upon valid state law authority. Desrosiers’ participation\n\nin the arrest did not render it unlawful under state law or the\n\nFourth Amendment. Because Santoni’s arrest was lawful, there is no\n\nbasis for finding liability for false arrest, false imprisonment,\n\nassault, or battery.        Therefore, we conclude that the district\n\ncourt properly granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants\n\non Santoni’s FTCA claims against the USPS.\n\n                                    III.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, the district court’s entry of\n\nsummary judgment in favor of the defendants is affirmed.\n\n       So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\f",

Desrosiers, a postal inspector who had sworn out the arrest warrant, accompanied the deputy sheriff and participated in the arrest. Santoni subsequently filed an 18-count complaint against Desrosiers, the USPS, and the sheriff and deputy sheriff of Somerset County, Maine, asserting a variety of federal constitutional and state law claims in connection with the allegedly unlawful arrest. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on all counts. Santoni appeals from the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the federal defendants<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> on his Fourth Amendment claim under <i>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics,</i> 403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), and his claims of unlawful arrest, assault, battery, and false imprisonment under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1346(b), 2671-2680. We affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 2, 1999, Michael Desrosiers, a postal inspector for the United States Postal Service, learned that the USPS had received a complaint concerning Vincent Santoni, the postmaster of Solon, Maine. The complaint alleged that Santoni had exposed himself to Heather M., a 15-year-old girl who resided in Solon. On August 13, 1999, Desrosiers' supervisor instructed him to conduct an immediate investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 16, 1999, Desrosiers interviewed Heather, who said that around 2 p.m. on July 15, 1999, she was riding her bicycle across a bridge near the post office in Solon when she heard someone call her name. She turned around and recognized Santoni, whom she knew, standing by the edge of the water with his pants down to his knees and both of his hands holding his exposed penis. Heather told Desrosiers that for several years Santoni had been making inappropriate sexual comments and gestures to her during her visits to the Solon post office. Heather's mother, who attended the interview, said that Santoni had also made inappropriate comments to her and to other women. Desrosiers prepared a type-written statement based on the interview, which Heather reviewed and signed. Over the next few weeks, Desrosiers interviewed other female customers of the Solon post office who reported that Santoni had touched them or made inappropriate comments while he was at work at the post office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 8, 1999, Desrosiers discussed the results of his investigation with Andrew Benson, an Assistant District Attorney (ADA) for Somerset County, Maine. At Benson's request, Desrosiers arranged for a fellow postal inspector, who was also a polygraph examiner, to administer a polygraph examination of Heather. After receiving the results of the test, which Heather passed, Desrosiers again discussed the case with ADA Benson. At the conclusion of that discussion, the DA's Office authorized the prosecution of Santoni on the criminal charge of indecent conduct, a Class E misdemeanor under 17A Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 854.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 5, 1999, Desrosiers appeared before the clerk of the state district court in Skowhegan, Maine, to present a request for a criminal complaint and a warrant for Santoni's arrest. He also submitted a supporting affidavit identifying Desrosiers as a postal inspector and stating that he had probable cause to believe that Santoni had committed the state law offense of indecent conduct, in violation of 17A Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 854. The affidavit provided details about Desrosiers' interview with Heather and stated that she had passed a polygraph examination. The court clerk issued a criminal complaint against Santoni for violating the indecent conduct statute and a corresponding warrant for his arrest. At Desrosiers' request, Randy Wing, a deputy sheriff for Somerset County, accompanied Desrosiers to Santoni's home, where Santoni was arrested. On April 21, 2000, Santoni was tried in the Skowhegan District Court and was acquitted after the court determined that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction for indecent conduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 3, 2002, Santoni filed an 18-count complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Maine against the USPS, Desrosiers, Wing, and Somerset County Sheriff Barry DeLong. He sued the USPS pursuant to the FTCA, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1346, 2671 <i>et seq.,</i> claiming that it was liable to him for unlawful arrest, abuse of process, malicious prosecution, false imprisonment, intentional and/or negligent infliction of emotional distress, assault, battery, invasion of privacy, and negligent supervision and training. He sued Desrosiers in his individual capacity, seeking damages for violations of the First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments of the United States Constitution pursuant to <i>Bivens,</i> 403 U.S. at 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999. Santoni brought analogous Fourth Amendment claims against Wing and DeLong pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983. He further claimed that all four defendants had engaged in a civil conspiracy to violate his federal and state civil rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 8, 2002, Desrosiers and the USPS, the federal defendants, moved to dismiss or for summary judgment on all of Santoni's federal claims. The district court determined that no constitutional rights had been violated and that, in any event, Desrosiers was protected from liability on Santoni's Fourth Amendment claim by the doctrine of qualified immunity. Although it found that Santoni's FTCA claims against the USPS did not fall within the FTCA's discretionary function exception, it held that the claims failed on their merits. Therefore, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Desrosiers and the USPS and dismissed Santoni's claims against them. After the district court granted summary judgment for the federal defendants, the lawsuit proceeded against DeLong and Wing. Following discovery, the state defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted. Santoni filed this appeal against all of the original defendants but has chosen not to prosecute his claims against the state defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Santoni challenges the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Desrosiers on Santoni's <i>Bivens</i> claim. He argues that because Desrosiers lacked authority under state or federal law to make an arrest for a Class E state law crime, the arrest of Santoni constituted an unreasonable seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment. He further claims that Desrosiers is not entitled to qualified immunity. In addition, Santoni argues that because the district court improperly determined that the arrest was lawful, it erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the USPS on Santoni's FTCA claims. We address each of these arguments in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Standard of Review</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo. <i>Wojcik v.

Summary judgment is appropriate where the evidence shows that \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). A fact is \"material\" if it \"might affect the outcome of the suit\" under the applicable legal standard. <i>Anderson v.

Postal inspectors are not authorized under federal law to execute a warrant or make an arrest for a state law offense. <i>See United States v.

Similarly, while Maine law permits some specifically designated \"federal officers\" to make arrests to enforce state law in certain situations, postal inspectors are not among these officers. 25 Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 1502-A. Thus, Desrosiers did not have authority under state or federal law to make an arrest for a violation of state law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, the district court concluded that although Maine law did not confer upon Desrosiers authority to arrest Santoni, it did authorize him to swear out a warrant for Santoni's arrest, either in his capacity as a law enforcement official or as a private citizen acting with the approval of the district attorney's office. It further held that the execution of the warrant was lawful because Desrosiers participated in the arrest as a private citizen and was assisted by Deputy Sheriff Wing, who had an affirmative duty to arrest Santoni. Santoni challenges both of these determinations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. Swearing Out the Criminal Complaint</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In accordance with Maine law, a Maine district court clerk may, in the absence or unavailability of a justice of the peace or a prosecuting attorney or any of his assistants, prepare and draft a misdemeanor criminal complaint \"upon the request of any law enforcement officer.\" 15 Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 708. While the statute does not define the phrase \"law enforcement officer,\" the district court interpreted it to include postal inspectors. We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When interpreting a statute under Maine law, words and phrases are to be construed in accordance with \"the plain meaning of the enactment.\" 1 Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 72. Applying this rule of statutory construction to 15 Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 708, we find that \"any\" law enforcement officer includes every kind of law enforcement officer, regardless of whether or not the officer is statutorily authorized to enforce state law. Moreover, we have regularly recognized postal inspectors as law enforcement officers. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Carrillo-Figueroa,</i> 34 F.3d 33, 43 (1st Cir.1994) (for sentence enhancement purposes, defendant should have known that postal inspector was a \"law enforcement officer\"); <i>see also Cosme v. Henderson,</i> 287 F.3d 152, 156 (2d Cir.2002) (Plaintiff \"applied for a position as a postal inspector, a highly competitive law enforcement position.\"); <i>Stout v. Potter,</i> 276 F.3d 1118, 1121 (9th Cir.2002) (The Postal Inspection Service is \"the law enforcement branch of the United States Postal Service.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santoni argues that the phrase \"law enforcement officers\" as used in 15 Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 708 does not include postal inspectors because postal inspectors are not among those federal law enforcement officials vested with the \"power to enforce state law\" under 25 Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 1502-A. However, 15 Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 708 does not limit authority to swear out a criminal complaint to state law enforcement officers and federal officers who are specifically empowered to enforce state law. Nor does 25 Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 1502-A place any limitations on the kinds of officers who may swear out complaints. Therefore, we agree with the district court that the phrase \"any law enforcement officer\" does not preclude postal officials from swearing out criminal complaints.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. Executing the Arrest Warrant</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santoni also argues, however, that even if Desrosiers was authorized to swear out and receive the complaint, he had no authority to carry out the arrest of Santoni. Once an arrest warrant is issued, only an \"officer authorized by law\" may execute that warrant. Me. R.Crim. P. 4(c)(1). As noted, postal inspectors are not among those officers authorized under Maine law to execute arrest warrants. 25 Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 1502-A. Santoni argues that Desrosiers also had no authority to execute the arrest in his capacity as a private citizen. Therefore, he claims that \"the district court's conclusion that Desrosiers was authorized as a private person to arrest Santoni was clearly erroneous and should be reversed.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santoni is correct that Maine law does not authorize private citizens to make an arrest for a Class E crime not committed in their presence. <i>See</i> 17-A Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 16; <i>cf. Unverzagt,</i> 424 F.2d at 398 (postal inspector's arrest of individual for carrying a concealed weapon was valid under Nebraska law that authorized private citizens to make an arrest for a felony committed in their presence). However, the district court held that Santoni's arrest was lawful, not because Desrosiers had state law authority to execute the warrant, but because Deputy Sheriff Wing participated in the arrest. In light of Wing's knowing participation in the arrest, the court explained that it \"would be elevating form over substance to conclude that the validity of the arrest depended on which of the two men uttered the words `You are under arrest,' or placed the Plaintiff in handcuffs.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court's conclusion that Santoni's arrest was lawful because it was carried out under Wing's lawful authority. Under Maine law, an arrest warrant \"shall be executed by any officer authorized by law.\" Me. R.Crim. P. 4(c)(1). Deputy Sheriff Wing was clearly authorized &#8212; and indeed, required &#8212; by law to arrest Santoni under 15 Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 602, which provides that \"[i]t is the responsibility of all police and sheriff departments and their officers to use all reasonable efforts to execute the outstanding arrest warrants of which they are aware.\" <i>See also Kane v. Anderson,</i> 509 A.2d 656, 657 (Me.1986) (concluding that \"the execution of an arrest warrant is a ministerial rather than a discretionary function\"); <i>Carroll v. City of Portland,</i> 736 A.2d 279, 283 (Me.1999) (\"[A] <i>ministerial</i> act is mandatory and requires no personal judgment or choice.\") (emphasis in original). It is undisputed that Wing accompanied Desrosiers at Desrosiers' request to Santoni's residence where Santoni was arrested and then transported by Wing and Desrosiers to the Somerset County Sheriff's Department. Based on these facts, the district court appropriately concluded that Wing was aware of the outstanding arrest warrant and had a legal duty to execute it. Desrosiers' presence at the arrest, for the purpose of assisting Wing in the execution of the warrant, did not render that arrest unlawful under state law or constitutionally infirm. <i>Cf. Wilson v. Layne,</i> 526 U.S. 603, 614, 119 S.Ct. 1692, 143 L.Ed.2d 818 (1999) (holding that \"it is a violation of the Fourth Amendment for police to bring members of the media or other third parties into a home during the execution of a warrant when the presence of third parties in the home was not in aid of the execution of the warrant\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the first time on appeal, Santoni argues that summary judgment was inappropriate because it is reasonable to infer that Wing was not aware of the warrant and therefore had no obligation to execute it. This argument relies on statements made by Wing in a deposition taken on January 31, 2003, five months after the entry of summary judgment in favor of the federal defendants. As Santoni acknowledges, however, this transcript was not available to the district court and therefore is not part of the record on appeal. Moreover, Santoni never argued below that Wing was unaware of the warrant. Indeed, his complaint suggested that Wing knowingly participated in the arrest, with a reference to the \"illegal arrest of Santoni <i>by defendants</i>\" and the claim that \"Defendants DeLong <i>and Wing</i> did not have probable cause to arrest Santoni\" (emphasis added). Similarly, in his opposition to the defendants' motion for summary judgment, Santoni alleged that Desrosiers \"arrested plaintiff without authority to do so and that the other defendants knew it was unlawful <i>but agreed to participate</i> \"(emphasis added). Because Santoni failed to raise below his theory that Wing had no obligation to arrest Santoni because he did not know about the warrant, this argument is now procedurally defaulted. <i>See Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers Union, Local No. 59 v. Superline Transp. Co.,</i> 953 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir.1992) (\"If any principle is settled in this circuit, it is that, absent the most extraordinary circumstances, legal theories not raised squarely in the lower court cannot be broached for the first time on appeal.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, Desrosiers had valid authority to swear out the criminal complaint and receive the complaint and warrant for Santoni's arrest, and Wing had valid authority to execute that warrant. Therefore, we agree with the district court that Santoni's arrest was lawful under Maine law and that it did not constitute an unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Qualified Immunity</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Santoni has not presented a viable constitutional claim, we do not consider whether Desrosiers is protected from liability by qualified immunity. <i>See Saucier v. Katz,</i> 533 U.S. 194 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001) (\"If no constitutional right would have been violated were the allegations established, there is no necessity for further inquiries concerning qualified immunity.\"); <i>Flowers v. Fiore,</i> 359 F.3d 24, 34 (1st Cir.2004) (\"Upon finding that there was no constitutional violation, we do not address the issue of qualified immunity.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>FTCA Claims Against the USPS</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next consider whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment for the USPS on Santoni's tort claims of unlawful arrest, assault, battery, and false imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2671 <i>et seq.,</i> provides a limited congressional waiver of the sovereign immunity of the United States for torts committed by federal employees acting within the scope of their employment. Under the statute, the United States may be held civilly liable \"in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2674. Certain types of intentional torts are exempted from the FTCA's waiver of sovereign immunity, but the statute allows claims against the United States for the torts of \"assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, abuse of process, or malicious prosecution\" arising out of \"acts or omissions of investigative or law enforcement officers of the United States Government.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2680(h).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This waiver of sovereign immunity, however, is subject to a number of statutory exceptions. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2680. One defense raised in the proceedings below was the discretionary function exception, which shields from liability claims \"based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the Government, whether or not the discretion involved be abused.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2680(a). If the discretionary function exception applies, the agency is completely immune from suit, and the claim must be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <i>Kelly v. United States,</i> 924 F.2d 355, 360 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held that the discretionary function exception did not preclude consideration of Santoni's tort claims against the USPS for alleged harms arising from Desrosiers' participation in the arrest of Santoni. Because Desrosiers acted outside the scope of his federal authority as a postal inspector when he participated in this arrest (regardless of whether his conduct was authorized under state law), the court concluded that the discretionary function exception did not apply.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> As we recently noted, \"courts have read the Supreme Court's discretionary function cases as denying protection to actions that are unauthorized because they are unconstitutional, proscribed by statute, or exceed the scope of an official's authority.\" <i>Thames Shipyard &amp; Repair Co. v. United States,</i> 350 F.3d 247, 254-55 (1st Cir.2003) (collecting cases). However, we have not resolved whether the discretionary function exception extends to actions that are otherwise outside the scope of an official's actual federal authority, and we need not do so here. Nor do we address whether Desrosiers had implied federal authority to participate in the arrest to the limited extent of swearing out the criminal complaint, receiving the arrest warrant, and assisting Wing in the execution of that warrant. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> at 260 (holding that the discretionary function exception applied where the Coast Guard had implied statutory authority to order the evacuation of a sinking ship). Assuming, <i>arguendo,</i> that the USPS is not shielded from liability by the discretionary function analysis, Santoni's tort claims fail on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted, under the FTCA, the USPS is liable for the torts of its agents, \"in the same manner and to the same extent of a private individual under like circumstances.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2674. Because the alleged tortious conduct took place in Maine, we look to Maine tort law in determining the defendant's liability under the FTCA. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1346(b)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santoni's claims of false arrest, false imprisonment, assault, and battery rely on the premise that Desrosiers acted <i>at least</i> negligently by arresting Santoni without any lawful authority to do so. Under Maine law, the torts of assault and battery by a law enforcement officer require either a false arrest or the use of excessive force during or after taking an individual into custody. <i>Bale v. Ryder,</i> 290 A.2d 359, 360 (Me.1972). Similarly, in order to establish a tort claim of false arrest and false imprisonment \"the authority upon which [P]laintiff is confined must be unlawful.\" <i>Nadeau v. State,</i> 395 A.2d 107, 116 (Me.1978) (stating elements of false imprisonment claim); <i>see Jedzierowski v. Jordan,</i> 157 Me. 352, 172 A.2d 636, 637 (1961) (holding that false arrest is one means of committing false imprisonment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have already concluded, <i>supra,</i> Santoni was arrested and confined upon valid state law authority. Desrosiers' participation in the arrest did not render it unlawful under state law or the Fourth Amendment. Because Santoni's arrest was lawful, there is no basis for finding liability for false arrest, false imprisonment, assault, or battery. Therefore, we conclude that the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on Santoni's FTCA claims against the USPS.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court's entry of summary judgment in favor of the defendants is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Both parties treat the claims against named defendant John E.

The complaint alleged that Santoni had exposed himself to Heather M., a 15-year-old girl who resided in Solon. On August 13, 1999, Desrosiers' supervisor instructed him to conduct an immediate investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 16, 1999, Desrosiers interviewed Heather, who said that around 2 p.m. on July 15, 1999, she was riding her bicycle across a bridge near the post office in Solon when she heard someone call her name. She turned around and recognized Santoni, whom she knew, standing by the edge of the water with his pants down to his knees and both of his hands holding his exposed penis. Heather told Desrosiers that for several years Santoni had been making inappropriate sexual comments and gestures to her during her visits to the Solon post office. Heather's mother, who attended the interview, said that Santoni had also made inappropriate comments to her and to other women. Desrosiers prepared a type-written statement based on the interview, which Heather reviewed and signed. Over the next few weeks, Desrosiers interviewed other female customers of the Solon post office who reported that Santoni had touched them or made inappropriate comments while he was at work at the post office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 8, 1999, Desrosiers discussed the results of his investigation with Andrew Benson, an Assistant District Attorney (ADA) for Somerset County, Maine. At Benson's request, Desrosiers arranged for a fellow postal inspector, who was also a polygraph examiner, to administer a polygraph examination of Heather. After receiving the results of the test, which Heather passed, Desrosiers again discussed the case with ADA Benson. At the conclusion of that discussion, the DA's Office authorized the prosecution of Santoni on the criminal charge of indecent conduct, a Class E misdemeanor under 17A Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 854.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 5, 1999, Desrosiers appeared before the clerk of the state district court in Skowhegan, Maine, to present a request for a criminal complaint and a warrant for Santoni's arrest. He also submitted a supporting affidavit identifying Desrosiers as a postal inspector and stating that he had probable cause to believe that Santoni had committed the state law offense of indecent conduct, in violation of 17A Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 854. The affidavit provided details about Desrosiers' interview with Heather and stated that she had passed a polygraph examination. The court clerk issued a criminal complaint against Santoni for violating the indecent conduct statute and a corresponding warrant for his arrest. At Desrosiers' request, Randy Wing, a deputy sheriff for Somerset County, accompanied Desrosiers to Santoni's home, where Santoni was arrested. On April 21, 2000, Santoni was tried in the Skowhegan District Court and was acquitted after the court determined that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction for indecent conduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 3, 2002, Santoni filed an 18-count complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Maine against the USPS, Desrosiers, Wing, and Somerset County Sheriff Barry DeLong. He sued the USPS pursuant to the FTCA, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1346, 2671 <i>et seq.,</i> claiming that it was liable to him for unlawful arrest, abuse of process, malicious prosecution, false imprisonment, intentional and/or negligent infliction of emotional distress, assault, battery, invasion of privacy, and negligent supervision and training. He sued Desrosiers in his individual capacity, seeking damages for violations of the First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments of the United States Constitution pursuant to <i>Bivens,</i> 403 U.S. at 388, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108375\"><a href=\"/opinion/108375/bivens-v-six-unknown-fed-narcotics-agents/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The district court determined that no constitutional rights had been violated and that, in any event, Desrosiers was protected from liability on Santoni's Fourth Amendment claim by the doctrine of qualified immunity. Although it found that Santoni's FTCA claims against the USPS did not fall within the FTCA's discretionary function exception, it held that the claims failed on their merits. Therefore, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Desrosiers and the USPS and dismissed Santoni's claims against them. After the district court granted summary judgment for the federal defendants, the lawsuit proceeded against DeLong and Wing. Following discovery, the state defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted. Santoni filed this appeal against all of the original defendants but has chosen not to prosecute his claims against the state defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Santoni challenges the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Desrosiers on Santoni's <i>Bivens</i> claim. He argues that because Desrosiers lacked authority under state or federal law to make an arrest for a Class E state law crime, the arrest of Santoni constituted an unreasonable seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment. He further claims that Desrosiers is not entitled to qualified immunity. In addition, Santoni argues that because the district court improperly determined that the arrest was lawful, it erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the USPS on Santoni's FTCA claims.

Moreover, we have regularly recognized postal inspectors as law enforcement officers. <i>See, e.g., United States v.

Ann. &#167; 708 does not limit authority to swear out a criminal complaint to state law enforcement officers and federal officers who are specifically empowered to enforce state law. Nor does 25 Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 1502-A place any limitations on the kinds of officers who may swear out complaints. Therefore, we agree with the district court that the phrase \"any law enforcement officer\" does not preclude postal officials from swearing out criminal complaints.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b.

Once an arrest warrant is issued, only an \"officer authorized by law\" may execute that warrant. Me. R.Crim. P. 4(c)(1). As noted, postal inspectors are not among those officers authorized under Maine law to execute arrest warrants. 25 Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 1502-A. Santoni argues that Desrosiers also had no authority to execute the arrest in his capacity as a private citizen. Therefore, he claims that \"the district court's conclusion that Desrosiers was authorized as a private person to arrest Santoni was clearly erroneous and should be reversed.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santoni is correct that Maine law does not authorize private citizens to make an arrest for a Class E crime not committed in their presence. <i>See</i> 17-A Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 16; <i>cf. Unverzagt,</i> 424 F.2d at 398 (postal inspector's arrest of individual for carrying a concealed weapon was valid under Nebraska law that authorized private citizens to make an arrest for a felony committed in their presence). However, the district court held that Santoni's arrest was lawful, not because Desrosiers had state law authority to execute the warrant, but because Deputy Sheriff Wing participated in the arrest. In light of Wing's knowing participation in the arrest, the court explained that it \"would be elevating form over substance to conclude that the validity of the arrest depended on which of the two men uttered the words `You are under arrest,' or placed the Plaintiff in handcuffs.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court's conclusion that Santoni's arrest was lawful because it was carried out under Wing's lawful authority. Under Maine law, an arrest warrant \"shall be executed by any officer authorized by law.\" Me. R.Crim. P. 4(c)(1). Deputy Sheriff Wing was clearly authorized &#8212; and indeed, required &#8212; by law to arrest Santoni under 15 Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 602, which provides that \"[i]t is the responsibility of all police and sheriff departments and their officers to use all reasonable efforts to execute the outstanding arrest warrants of which they are aware.\" <i>See also Kane v. Anderson,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">656</span></span>, 657 (Me.1986) (concluding that \"the execution of an arrest warrant is a ministerial rather than a discretionary function\"); <i>Carroll v.

It is undisputed that Wing accompanied Desrosiers at Desrosiers' request to Santoni's residence where Santoni was arrested and then transported by Wing and Desrosiers to the Somerset County Sheriff's Department. Based on these facts, the district court appropriately concluded that Wing was aware of the outstanding arrest warrant and had a legal duty to execute it. Desrosiers' presence at the arrest, for the purpose of assisting Wing in the execution of the warrant, did not render that arrest unlawful under state law or constitutionally infirm. <i>Cf. Wilson v.

This argument relies on statements made by Wing in a deposition taken on January 31, 2003, five months after the entry of summary judgment in favor of the federal defendants. As Santoni acknowledges, however, this transcript was not available to the district court and therefore is not part of the record on appeal. Moreover, Santoni never argued below that Wing was unaware of the warrant. Indeed, his complaint suggested that Wing knowingly participated in the arrest, with a reference to the \"illegal arrest of Santoni <i>by defendants</i>\" and the claim that \"Defendants DeLong <i>and Wing</i> did not have probable cause to arrest Santoni\" (emphasis added). Similarly, in his opposition to the defendants' motion for summary judgment, Santoni alleged that Desrosiers \"arrested plaintiff without authority to do so and that the other defendants knew it was unlawful <i>but agreed to participate</i> \"(emphasis added). Because Santoni failed to raise below his theory that Wing had no obligation to arrest Santoni because he did not know about the warrant, this argument is now procedurally defaulted. <i>See Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers Union, Local No. 59 v.

Under the statute, the United States may be held civilly liable \"in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2674. Certain types of intentional torts are exempted from the FTCA's waiver of sovereign immunity, but the statute allows claims against the United States for the torts of \"assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, abuse of process, or malicious prosecution\" arising out of \"acts or omissions of investigative or law enforcement officers of the United States Government.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2680(h).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This waiver of sovereign immunity, however, is subject to a number of statutory exceptions. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2680. One defense raised in the proceedings below was the discretionary function exception, which shields from liability claims \"based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the Government, whether or not the discretion involved be abused.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2680(a). If the discretionary function exception applies, the agency is completely immune from suit, and the claim must be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <i>Kelly v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555046\"><a href=\"/opinion/555046/john-l-kelly-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">924</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">355</span></a></span>, 360 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held that the discretionary function exception did not preclude consideration of Santoni's tort claims against the USPS for alleged harms arising from Desrosiers' participation in the arrest of Santoni. Because Desrosiers acted outside the scope of his federal authority as a postal inspector when he participated in this arrest (regardless of whether his conduct was authorized under state law), the court concluded that the discretionary function exception did not apply.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> As we recently noted, \"courts have read the Supreme Court's discretionary function cases as denying protection to actions that are unauthorized because they are unconstitutional, proscribed by statute, or exceed the scope of an official's authority.\" <i>Thames Shipyard &amp; Repair Co. v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200746\"><a href=\"/opinion/200746/thames-shipyard-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">350</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">247</span></a></span>, 254-55 (1st Cir.2003) (collecting cases). However, we have not resolved whether the discretionary function exception extends to actions that are otherwise outside the scope of an official's actual federal authority, and we need not do so here. Nor do we address whether Desrosiers had implied federal authority to participate in the arrest to the limited extent of swearing out the criminal complaint, receiving the arrest warrant, and assisting Wing in the execution of that warrant. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> at 260 (holding that the discretionary function exception applied where the Coast Guard had implied statutory authority to order the evacuation of a sinking ship). Assuming, <i>arguendo,</i> that the USPS is not shielded from liability by the discretionary function analysis, Santoni's tort claims fail on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted, under the FTCA, the USPS is liable for the torts of its agents, \"in the same manner and to the same extent of a private individual under like circumstances.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2674. Because the alleged tortious conduct took place in Maine, we look to Maine tort law in determining the defendant's liability under the FTCA. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1346(b)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santoni's claims of false arrest, false imprisonment, assault, and battery rely on the premise that Desrosiers acted <i>at least</i> negligently by arresting Santoni without any lawful authority to do so. Under Maine law, the torts of assault and battery by a law enforcement officer require either a false arrest or the use of excessive force during or after taking an individual into custody. <i>Bale v. Ryder,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">290</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">359</span></span>, 360 (Me.1972). Similarly, in order to establish a tort claim of false arrest and false imprisonment \"the authority upon which [P]laintiff is confined must be unlawful.\" <i>Nadeau v. State,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></span>, 116 (Me.1978) (stating elements of false imprisonment claim); <i>see Jedzierowski v.

Desrosiers' participation in the arrest did not render it unlawful under state law or the Fourth Amendment. Because Santoni's arrest was lawful, there is no basis for finding liability for false arrest, false imprisonment, assault, or battery. Therefore, we conclude that the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on Santoni's FTCA claims against the USPS.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court's entry of summary judgment in favor of the defendants is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Both parties treat the claims against named defendant John E.
