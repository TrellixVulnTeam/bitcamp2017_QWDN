R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                         For the First Circuit\n\n\nNo. 05-2487\n\n                              DANIEL B.

George A. O'Toole, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                    Before\n\n              Selya, Lynch, and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Daniel B. Dube, on brief pro se.\n     Richard W. Paterniti and Joan Ackerstein, Jackson Lewis, LLP,\non brief for defendant, appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                             October 13, 2006\n\f            Per Curiam. After a thorough review of the record and of\n\nthe parties’ submissions, we affirm.\n\n            We see no abuse of discretion in the district court’s\n\nrefusal to award a statutory penalty pursuant to 29 U.S.C. §\n\n1132(c)(1)(B).    See Rodriguez-Abreu v. Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A.,\n\n986 F.2d 580, 588 (1st Cir. 1993).      The district court noted the\n\nabsence of bad faith on the part of defendant/appellee J.P. Morgan\n\nInvestor Services (“JPMIS”), and there was no evidence that any\n\ndelay    prejudiced   plaintiff/appellant   Daniel   Dube’s   attempt   to\n\ncollect disability payments.      See Sullivan v. Raytheon Co., 262\n\nF.3d 41, 52 (1st Cir. 2001) (in deciding whether to assess a penalty\n\nfor delay, a court may consider whether the employer acted in bad\n\nfaith or whether delay prejudiced the plaintiff) (citing Rodriguez-\n\nAbreu, 986 F.2d at 588-89).       Dube admitted that his claim for\n\ninsurance benefits was rejected because he failed to provide\n\nmedical documentation to support the claim.          Although the plan\n\ndocuments originally provided to Dube apparently were out-of-date\n\n(and, therefore, may have made the claim process more difficult or\n\nfrustrating for Dube), that fact ultimately had no effect on the\n\noutcome of his claim for disability coverage.1          Accordingly, we\n\naffirm the district court’s award of summary judgment in JPMIS’s\n\nfavor on this count.\n\n\n     1\n      Dube contends that JPMIS had an obligation to       keep its plan\ndocuments up-to-date, and while other provisions          in ERISA may\nimpose this requirement, subsection 1132(b)(1)(C) –       the provision\nunder which Dube seeks relief – does not provide a        remedy for an\nemployer’s failure to update its documents.\n\f            We also affirm the district court’s award of summary\n\njudgment on Dube’s claims under the Family and Medical Leave Act\n\n(“FMLA”).    Dube first argues that JPMIS did not comply with the\n\nrequirement that it post a notice alerting all employees of their\n\nrights and obligations under the FMLA. See 29 C.F.R. § 825.300(a).\n\nJPMIS posted its FMLA notice on its intranet website – which was\n\naccessible to all employees while they were at work – and Dube says\n\nthis was insufficient because he could not access it from home\n\nduring his leave period.   But, JPMIS was not required to post the\n\nnotice where it could be seen by employees at home; the regulation\n\nonly requires that the notice be posted at the workplace, and Dube\n\ncites no authority to support his suggestion that this rule is\n\ndifferent where the notice is posted electronically.    The district\n\ncourt properly rejected this claim.\n\n            Dube also complains that JPMIS did not provide him with\n\nadequate individual notice of his rights or duties under the FMLA\n\nonce he announced his need for leave, as required by 29 C.F.R. §\n\n825.301(b), nor did it discuss the FMLA with him.      Even if JPMIS\n\nfailed in its duties under 29 C.F.R. § 825.301(b) – a question we\n\ndo not decide – Dube has no remedy.    That is because JPMIS gave him\n\nthe full 12-weeks (and more) of FMLA leave to which           he was\n\nentitled.   In Ragsdale v. Wolverine World Wide, Inc., 535 U.S. 81\n\n(2002), the Court ruled that where an employee had received all of\n\nthe FMLA leave to which that employee was entitled, the employee\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fhad no remedy for the employer’s technical violation of the notice\n\nrequirements.   Id. at 89-90.      The only exception to this rule\n\noccurs where the employee can show that the lack of notice caused\n\nsome prejudice (e.g., that the employee would not have structured\n\nleave in the same way had notice been provided); but we see nothing\n\nin this record indicating that Dube was prejudiced by any lack of\n\nnotice.\n\n          Dube next argues that he was not provided the full 12\n\nweeks of FMLA to which he was entitled.        This argument fails.     Dube\n\ninsists that he did not receive his full 12 weeks of FMLA leave\n\nbecause JPMIS purported to start his unpaid FMLA leave on April 8,\n\n2002 (about seven weeks into the 15-week leave period he was\n\nafforded), and he contends that he was entitled to 12 weeks of FMLA\n\nleave beginning on April 8.       In Ragsdale, the Court explicitly\n\nrejected such a notion, holding that an employer was only obligated\n\nto give an employee 12 weeks of FMLA leave, and that this was true\n\nno matter what additional benefits (e.g., paid leave) were provided\n\nby a more generous company policy or when the employer first\n\ndesignated the leave as FMLA leave.       The district court properly\n\nrejected this claim.\n\n          Finally,     Dube   argues    that    he   was   discharged    in\n\nretaliation for invoking his rights under the FMLA.          Even if Dube\n\ncan establish a prima facie case of retaliation, see Colburn v.\n\nParker Hannifin, 429 F.3d 325, 336 (1st Cir. 2005), JPMIS has\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fadvanced legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for dismissing Dube\n\nafter 15 weeks of leave:     he failed to provide documentation\n\nshowing that he was unable to return to work after April 8, and\n\neven if he had provided that documentation (he says he did, though\n\nhe provides no proof), the uncontradicted evidence shows that Dube\n\nwas unable to return to work after the expiration of his 15-week\n\nleave period. This provides a second legitimate, nondiscriminatory\n\nreason for Dube’s dismissal.     Thus, Dube must show that these\n\nstated reasons are pretextual.     See id.   He has pointed to no\n\nevidence of pretext in the record, and we see none.   Indeed, there\n\nis ample evidence to the contrary.       Though it was under no\n\nobligation to do so, JPMIS paid Dube’s full salary throughout most\n\nof his leave.   It began doing so immediately (in February 2002),\n\ndespite the fact that it took Dube a full seven weeks to provide\n\nany documentation of his medical condition.     And, although the\n\ndocumentation he did eventually provide stated that Dube could\n\nreturn to work (part-time) on April 8, 2002, Dube remained on\n\nleave, and JPMIS continued to pay his full salary for an additional\n\neight weeks (later recovering one paycheck covering a two-week\n\nperiod).   In all, Dube was given 13 weeks of paid leave (and an\n\nadditional two weeks of unpaid leave), despite his failure to\n\ndocument fully his inability to work throughout the last eight\n\nweeks of that period, and despite the fact that the FMLA only\n\nrequired JPMIS to give Dube 12 weeks of unpaid leave.   Dube points\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fto nothing in the record which might show JPMIS’s reasons for\n\ndismissing him after this leave period were pretextual or that its\n\naction were retaliatory.   Accordingly, the district court properly\n\ngranted summary judgment on this claim.\n\n          Affirmed.   See 1st Cir. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f",
