Mukasey as the\nrespondent herein.\n**\n     Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f           HOWARD, Circuit Judge.      Francisco Antonio Castro-Soto, a\n\ncitizen and national of the Dominican Republic, petitions for\n\nreview of the denial of his application for adjustment of status.\n\nThe Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") determined that Castro-\n\nSoto was ineligible for adjustment of status because he entered the\n\nUnited States illegally and could not be \"grandfathered\" under\n\nSection 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1255(i).       After review, we agree and deny his petition.\n\n                                      I.\n\n           In 2005, Castro-Soto entered the United States illegally.\n\nHe was subsequently detained and charged with removability. At his\n\nremoval proceeding, Castro-Soto sought adjustment of status, \"a\n\nprocess whereby certain aliens physically present in the United\n\nStates may obtain permanent resident status . . . . without leaving\n\nthe United States.\"      De Acosta v. Holder, 556 F.3d 16, 18 (1st Cir.\n\n2009).   In requesting adjustment, Castro-Soto relied in part on an\n\nI-130 visa petition that his spouse had filed on his behalf in\n\nDecember 2004. Despite a statutory bar against adjustment by those\n\nwho have entered the country illegally, Castro-Soto asserted that\n\nthe visa petition could support adjustment of his status, because\n\nhe was \"grandfathered\" based on a previous visa petition that had\n\nbeen filed on his behalf several years earlier.\n\n           This   was    not   the   first   time   that   Castro-Soto   had\n\nattempted to adjust his status based on his marriage to a United\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fStates citizen.      He first entered the United States in 1988.1          At\n\nsome point thereafter, he married his first wife, a United States\n\ncitizen.     In March 1992, she filed an I-130 petition on his behalf,\n\nseeking to qualify him as an immediate relative-spouse.                See 8\n\nU.S.C.   §   1154(a)(1)(A)(i);     8   C.F.R.   §   204.1(a)(1);   8   C.F.R.\n\n§ 204.2(a).\n\n             Based   on   his   then-spouse's   immediate   relative    visa\n\npetition, Castro-Soto filed an I-485 application for adjustment of\n\nstatus to that of lawful permanent resident.          See 8 U.S.C. § 1255;\n\n8 C.F.R. § 245.1(a). The immediate relative visa petition received\n\nfinal approval in June 1992, and in December 1992 Castro-Soto's\n\napplication for adjustment of status was also approved.\n\n             The approval of the application for adjustment of status\n\ncontained conditions, however.          Under the INA, when an alien who\n\nhas been married to a United States citizen for less than two years\n\nreceives permanent resident status by virtue of that marriage, the\n\ngrant of permanent resident status is conditional.             8 U.S.C. §\n\n1186a.     The alien and his spouse must submit a second petition\n\nrequesting the removal of conditions, at which point the government\n\nmay terminate the alien's permanent status if it finds that the\n\n\n1\n The record is clear that Castro-Soto obtained conditional lawful\npermanent residence in December 1992. The government says that he\nfirst entered the United States in 1988, citing a transcript of a\nhearing that was held below. This date appears accurate, as the I-\n130 form filed by Castro-Soto's first wife on his behalf indicates\nthat he arrived in December of 1988. We thus identify 1988 as his\narrival year, although this fact is immaterial to our analysis.\n\n                                       -3-\n\fmarriage is not bona fide.           8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c), (d).            If the alien\n\nfails to have the conditions to lawful permanent residence removed,\n\nhis permanent resident status is terminated as of the date of that\n\ndetermination. 8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(3)(C).\n\n            Castro-Soto and his spouse did later petition for removal\n\nof the conditions, but their petition was denied.                       An Immigration\n\nJudge    (\"IJ\")       subsequently    found    that    the   petition         to   remove\n\nconditions had been denied because the \"[g]overnment questioned the\n\nbona fides of the marriage and the intent of the marriage.\"\n\n            Castro-Soto and his first wife divorced in 2001. He then\n\nsought relief from the consequences of the previous denial of the\n\njoint petition for removal of conditions, through an application\n\nfor a waiver based on a good faith marriage ending in divorce.                         In\n\nJune 2002, the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") denied the\n\nwaiver application and placed Castro-Soto in removal proceedings.\n\nSee 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(D)(i) (classifying as \"deportable\" aliens\n\nwhose conditional permanent resident status has been terminated).\n\n            During removal proceedings, Castro-Soto again sought a\n\nwaiver    for     a    good   faith    marriage       ending       in   divorce,     and\n\nalternatively         requested   cancellation     of   removal         and   voluntary\n\ndeparture.      In September 2003, the IJ, though granting Castro-Soto\n\nvoluntary    departure,       denied    his    requests      for    cancellation      of\n\nremoval and for a waiver.            Castro-Soto appealed the IJ's decision\n\nto the BIA, which affirmed the IJ's decision in December 2004.\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\f            Also in 2004, Castro-Soto remarried. In January 2005, he\n\nleft the country pursuant to the voluntary departure order, but not\n\nbefore filing a motion to reopen his case so that he could apply\n\nfor adjustment of status based on his second wife's petition to\n\ncategorize him as an immediate relative.2        He reentered the United\n\nStates illegally eight days later and was subsequently placed in\n\nremoval proceedings.      Before the IJ, Castro-Soto again sought\n\nunsuccessfully to adjust his status, claiming that he was permitted\n\nto   rely   on   the   more   recent     visa   petition   because   of     a\n\ngrandfathering mechanism triggered by the 1992 visa petition.             The\n\nBIA affirmed the IJ's order pretermitting Castro-Soto's application\n\nfor adjustment.\n\n                                   II.\n\n            Before us, Castro-Soto continues to argue that he is\n\nentitled to rely on the earlier I-130 petition filed in 1992 to\n\nadjust his status now.        Typically, aliens who enter the United\n\nStates without inspection or parole are prohibited from applying\n\nfor adjustment of status.      Echevarria v. Keisler, 505 F.3d 16, 19\n\n(1st Cir. 2007); see also 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a), (c).         An exception to\n\nthis general rule exists for beneficiaries of visa petitions that\n\n\n2\n The BIA denied this motion to reopen in January 2005.           It\nconcluded that Castro-Soto could not adjust status based on his\nsecond-wife's 2004 visa petition because he failed to produce clear\nand convincing evidence that his second marriage was bona fide.\nCastro-Soto did not petition for review of this decision, although\nhe did file a motion to reconsider, which the BIA denied in March\n2005. Castro-Soto did not appeal that ruling.\n\n                                   -5-\n\fwere   filed      before        April        30,     2001.        See    8    C.F.R.\n\n§ 245.10(a)(1)(i)(A), (B); Echevarria, 505 F.3d at 19. Castro-Soto\n\nclaims that because he is the beneficiary of his first wife's 1992\n\nvisa petition, he qualifies under this grandfathering provision to\n\nfile again for adjustment.\n\n           An    alien    may    qualify       for    grandfathering     if   he   is\n\nphysically present and the \"beneficiary\" of a visa petition. §\n\n245.10(a)(1)(i).        The visa petition relied upon by the alien must\n\nhave been (1) filed before April 30, 2001, (2) \"properly filed,\"\n\nand (3) \"approvable when filed\".              Id. at (a)(1)(i)(A); (a)(2)(i);\n\n(a)(3).3   If the visa petition has met these three requirements, it\n\nmay be used for grandfathering purposes even if it \"was later\n\nwithdrawn, denied, or revoked due to circumstances that have arisen\n\nafter the time of filing\".             Id. at (a)(3); see also, Echevarria,\n\n505 F.3d at 19.         The applicant bears the burden of proving his\n\neligibility for adjustment of status.                8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(d).\n\n           The BIA did not question whether the 1992 visa petition\n\nupon which Castro-Soto is relying for grandfathering purposes\n\nsatisfied 245.10's three requirements.                Rather, it concluded that\n\nCastro-Soto     could    not    rely    on    the    1992    petition   because    the\n\ngovernment had granted it, and Castro-Soto had relied upon the\n\npetition to gain conditional lawful permanent residence. The Board\n\n\n3\n To be \"approvable when filed,\" a visa petition must have been:\n\"properly filed, meritorious in fact, and non-frivolous.\" Id. at\n(a)(3).\n\n                                         -6-\n\ffurther stressed that Castro-Soto had not only adjusted his status\n\nusing his ex-wife's visa petition, but also \"later failed to obtain\n\nremoval of the conditions on his permanent residence.\"\n\n            Our review of the BIA's decision is circumscribed.         When\n\nCongress has entrusted rulemaking and administrative authority to\n\nan agency, as it has done with the INA, \"courts normally accord the\n\nagency particular deference in respect to the interpretation of\n\nregulations promulgated under that authority.\" S. Shore Hosp. Inc.\n\nv. Thompson, 308 F.3d 91, 97 (1st Cir. Mass. 2002).            We defer to\n\nthe agency's interpretations of regulations of its own creation\n\nunless the agency's position is \"plainly erroneous or inconsistent\n\nwith the regulation.\"         Massachusetts v. United States, 522 F.3d\n\n115, 127 (1st Cir. 2008).         We conclude that it was not plainly\n\nerroneous or inconsistent with the regulation for the BIA to find\n\nthat Castro-Soto had obtained all of the benefit due to him based\n\non   the   1992   petition,    and   that   the   petition   was   therefore\n\nextinguished and cannot now provide grandfathered status.4\n\n\n\n\n4\n The government takes the position that, once Castro-Soto initially\nobtained the benefit of conditional permanent residence, the\npetition was no longer available to be used for grandfathering.\nThe government's position may be correct, but we are not certain\nthat the BIA's ruling is quite that broad, and we need not adopt\nthe broader reading in order to reject the petitioner's argument.\nWe are not here faced with a situation in which, for example, the\npetitioner obtained conditional resident status and then, prior to\nthe deadline for petitioning to remove the conditions, sought to\nrely on the grandfathered petition to adjust status on a different\nbasis.\n\n                                     -7-\n\f           Congress has generally allowed only lawfully present\n\naliens to adjust their status while in the United States, in order\n\n\"to discourage intending immigrants from moving to the United\n\nStates before becoming fully eligible for permanent residence and\n\nto encourage them to follow the orderly consular process for the\n\nissuance   of   immigrant   visas.\"     Lee   v.   U.S.   Citizenship   &\n\nImmigration Servs., No. 08-1659, 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 1569, at *4\n\n(4th Cir. Jan. 25, 2010).    In 1994, however, Congress temporarily\n\nlifted restrictions on certain illegal aliens who sought adjustment\n\nof status.      Id.   The grandfather clause, instituted after the\n\nexpiration of this 1994 Act, \"aimed to protect those who had\n\nlegitimate visa applications on file before the more restrictive\n\namendment came into force excluding applications on behalf of those\n\nwho entered illegally.\"      Echevarria, 505 F.3d at 19.        We have\n\nobserved that it was not these applicants' fault \"that it might\n\ntake time to process applications that had been filed before the\n\nlaw changed.\" Id.\n\n           It is not an illogical corollary that an applicant's\n\ngrandfathered status should expire once he has obtained all of the\n\nbenefits available through a visa petition.        The DHS reached this\n\nvery conclusion in a 2005 policy memorandum in considering the\n\npotential for multiple filings for adjustment of status under\n\nSection 245(i):\n\n\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\f          A grandfathered alien is eligible to file an\n          application to adjust status under section\n          245(i) as long as the alien meets the\n          requirements of 8 C.F.R. 245.10 and has not\n          adjusted status under section 245(i). USCIS\n          no longer considers an alien \"grandfathered\"\n          once the alien is granted adjustment of status\n          under section 245(i), because the alien has\n          acquired   the   only  intended   benefit   of\n          grandfathering:   [Lawful Permanent Resident]\n          status.\n\n\n\nInteroffice Memorandum from William R. Yates, Associate Director\n\nfor   Operations,    U.S.   Citizenship    and   Immigration    Services,\n\nDepartment   of     Homeland   Security,   Clarification   of     Certain\n\nEligibility Requirements Pertaining to an Application to Adjust\n\nStatus under Section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act,\n\nHQOPRD 70/23.1 at 6 (March 9, 2005).       This guidance memorandum is\n\nentitled to our respect to the extent that it is persuasive.         See\n\nChristensen v. Harris County, 529 U.S. 576, 587 (2000).5\n\n\n5\n The quoted language is consistent with the regulations themselves,\nwhich provide that certain visa petitions approvable when filed but\nlater \"withdrawn, denied or revoked due to circumstances that have\narisen after the time of filing\" can still be used to establish an\nalien's grandfathered status. 8 C.F.R. § 1245.10(a)(3). Castro-\nSoto's spouse's 1992 petition was approved, and it was never\nrevoked. Indeed, although the regulations provide for automatic\nrevocation under certain circumstances -- for example, divorce --\nthis provision is only triggered when the circumstance occurs\nbefore the government's final decision on the beneficiary's\nadjustment application. 8 C.F.R. § 1205.1 (a)(3). Castro-Soto's\nadjustment of status was granted in December, 1992. He and his\nfirst wife did not divorce until 2001.\n      Nowhere do the regulations state that an approved petition, as\nopposed to one that is pending, withdrawn, denied or revoked, can\nbe used to preserve the alien's grandfathered status.       The BIA\ncould reasonably conclude from this silence that this exclusion was\n\n                                   -9-\n\f           Castro-Soto argues that his 1992 visa petition was never\n\nextinguished because he never acquired lawful permanent resident\n\nstatus without conditions.         DHS's 2005 memorandum, he observes,\n\nexplains   that    the   government    \"no   longer   considers    an    alien\n\n'grandfathered' once the alien is granted adjustment of status\n\nunder Section 245(i) because the alien has acquired . . .            [Lawful\n\nPermanent Resident] status\" (emphasis added). Castro-Soto urges us\n\nto hold that because he only acquired conditional lawful permanent\n\nresident status, his 1992 visa petition is still available for\n\npurposes of grandfathering.\n\n           No     persuasive    authority    is   cited   to   support    this\n\ninterpretation, and in any event there is a significant problem\n\nwith it.   Were we to adopt Castro-Soto's view, all grandfathered\n\naliens who, because of their own lack of proof, failed to remove\n\nconditions attached to their lawful permanent resident status could\n\nsimply fling infinite subsequent petitions or applications for\n\nadjustment until one happened to stick.           Congress could not have\n\nintended such a result.        Cf. Echevarria, 505 F.3d at 19–20 (\"There\n\nis no reason to think that the grandfathering provision was meant\n\nto give a second bite at the apple to one who earlier had a full\n\nand fair opportunity to prove the marriage was bona fide.\").\n\n\nintentional. See Lohnes v. Level 3 Commc'ns, Inc., 272 F.3d 49, 61\n(1st Cir. 2001) (\"[T]he maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius\ninstructs that, 'when parties list specific items in a document,\nany   item   not   so   listed   is   typically   thought   to   be\nexcluded.'\")(citation omitted).\n\n                                     -10-\n\fIndeed, this reading would undermine the government's ability to\n\nuse conditional resident status as a tool to root out unlawful\n\nimmigration based on sham marriages.    See Choin v. Mukasey, 537\n\nF.3d 1116, 1120 (9th Cir. 2008) (\"Congress . . . created the\n\nconditional permanent resident status to enable the government to\n\ngather two years of evidence about a marriage before granting full\n\npermanent resident status.\")\n\n          Because Castro-Soto married his first wife less than two\n\nyears before she filed her I-130 petition on his behalf, this\n\npetition provided him a basis to obtain only conditional lawful\n\npermanent resident status and, at most, the later opportunity as\n\nwell as the obligation to seek the removal of those conditions.\n\nSee 8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c), (d).     Castro-Soto fully exercised his\n\nright to petition to have his conditions removed. As mentioned, he\n\nand his first wife filed a joint petition to have the conditions on\n\nhis lawful permanent resident status removed, but the agency\n\nquestioned the bona fides of the marriage and denied that petition.\n\nAfter he and his first wife divorced, Castro-Soto filed a waiver\n\napplication for a good faith marriage ending in divorce which, if\n\ngranted, would have removed the conditions on his lawful permanent\n\nresident status.    The BIA affirmed the denial of that waiver\n\napplication, however, and Castro-Soto never petitioned for review\n\nof that decision.\n\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\f                               III.\n\n          We affirm the BIA's determination that the 1992 petition\n\nwas extinguished for grandfathering purposes, at the latest, by the\n\ntime Castro-Soto's conditional lawful permanent residency expired\n\nand he became removable.\n\n\n\nPetition denied.\n\n\n\n\n                               -12-\n\f",

Francisco Antonio Castro-Soto, a\n\ncitizen and national of the Dominican Republic, petitions for\n\nreview of the denial of his application for adjustment of status.\n\nThe Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") determined that Castro-\n\nSoto was ineligible for adjustment of status because he entered the\n\nUnited States illegally and could not be \"grandfathered\" under\n\nSection 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1255(i).       After review, we agree and deny his petition.\n\n                                      I.\n\n           In 2005, Castro-Soto entered the United States illegally.\n\nHe was subsequently detained and charged with removability. At his\n\nremoval proceeding, Castro-Soto sought adjustment of status, \"a\n\nprocess whereby certain aliens physically present in the United\n\nStates may obtain permanent resident status . . . . without leaving\n\nthe United States.\"      De Acosta v. Holder, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203663\"><a href=\"/opinion/203663/de-acosta-v-holder/\"><span class=\"volume\">556</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 18 (1st Cir.\n\n2009).   In requesting adjustment, Castro-Soto relied in part on an\n\nI-130 visa petition that his spouse had filed on his behalf in\n\nDecember 2004. Despite a statutory bar against adjustment by those\n\nwho have entered the country illegally, Castro-Soto asserted that\n\nthe visa petition could support adjustment of his status, because\n\nhe was \"grandfathered\" based on a previous visa petition that had\n\nbeen filed on his behalf several years earlier.\n\n           This   was    not   the   first   time   that   Castro-Soto   had\n\nattempted to adjust his status based on his marriage to a United\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fStates citizen.      He first entered the United States in 1988.1          At\n\nsome point thereafter, he married his first wife, a United States\n\ncitizen.     In March 1992, she filed an I-130 petition on his behalf,\n\nseeking to qualify him as an immediate relative-spouse.                See 8\n\nU.S.C.   §   1154(a)(1)(A)(i);     8   C.F.R.   §   204.1(a)(1);   8   C.F.R.\n\n§ 204.2(a).\n\n             Based   on   his   then-spouse's   immediate   relative    visa\n\npetition, Castro-Soto filed an I-485 application for adjustment of\n\nstatus to that of lawful permanent resident.          See 8 U.S.C. § 1255;\n\n8 C.F.R. § 245.1(a). The immediate relative visa petition received\n\nfinal approval in June 1992, and in December 1992 Castro-Soto's\n\napplication for adjustment of status was also approved.\n\n             The approval of the application for adjustment of status\n\ncontained conditions, however.          Under the INA, when an alien who\n\nhas been married to a United States citizen for less than two years\n\nreceives permanent resident status by virtue of that marriage, the\n\ngrant of permanent resident status is conditional.             8 U.S.C. §\n\n1186a.     The alien and his spouse must submit a second petition\n\nrequesting the removal of conditions, at which point the government\n\nmay terminate the alien's permanent status if it finds that the\n\n\n1\n The record is clear that Castro-Soto obtained conditional lawful\npermanent residence in December 1992. The government says that he\nfirst entered the United States in 1988, citing a transcript of a\nhearing that was held below. This date appears accurate, as the I-\n130 form filed by Castro-Soto's first wife on his behalf indicates\nthat he arrived in December of 1988. We thus identify 1988 as his\narrival year, although this fact is immaterial to our analysis.\n\n                                       -3-\n\fmarriage is not bona fide.           8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c), (d).            If the alien\n\nfails to have the conditions to lawful permanent residence removed,\n\nhis permanent resident status is terminated as of the date of that\n\ndetermination. 8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(3)(C).\n\n            Castro-Soto and his spouse did later petition for removal\n\nof the conditions, but their petition was denied.                       An Immigration\n\nJudge    (\"IJ\")       subsequently    found    that    the   petition         to   remove\n\nconditions had been denied because the \"[g]overnment questioned the\n\nbona fides of the marriage and the intent of the marriage.\"\n\n            Castro-Soto and his first wife divorced in 2001. He then\n\nsought relief from the consequences of the previous denial of the\n\njoint petition for removal of conditions, through an application\n\nfor a waiver based on a good faith marriage ending in divorce.                         In\n\nJune 2002, the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") denied the\n\nwaiver application and placed Castro-Soto in removal proceedings.\n\nSee 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(D)(i) (classifying as \"deportable\" aliens\n\nwhose conditional permanent resident status has been terminated).\n\n            During removal proceedings, Castro-Soto again sought a\n\nwaiver    for     a    good   faith    marriage       ending       in   divorce,     and\n\nalternatively         requested   cancellation     of   removal         and   voluntary\n\ndeparture.      In September 2003, the IJ, though granting Castro-Soto\n\nvoluntary    departure,       denied    his    requests      for    cancellation      of\n\nremoval and for a waiver.            Castro-Soto appealed the IJ's decision\n\nto the BIA, which affirmed the IJ's decision in December 2004.\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\f            Also in 2004, Castro-Soto remarried. In January 2005, he\n\nleft the country pursuant to the voluntary departure order, but not\n\nbefore filing a motion to reopen his case so that he could apply\n\nfor adjustment of status based on his second wife's petition to\n\ncategorize him as an immediate relative.2        He reentered the United\n\nStates illegally eight days later and was subsequently placed in\n\nremoval proceedings.      Before the IJ, Castro-Soto again sought\n\nunsuccessfully to adjust his status, claiming that he was permitted\n\nto   rely   on   the   more   recent     visa   petition   because   of     a\n\ngrandfathering mechanism triggered by the 1992 visa petition.             The\n\nBIA affirmed the IJ's order pretermitting Castro-Soto's application\n\nfor adjustment.\n\n                                   II.\n\n            Before us, Castro-Soto continues to argue that he is\n\nentitled to rely on the earlier I-130 petition filed in 1992 to\n\nadjust his status now.        Typically, aliens who enter the United\n\nStates without inspection or parole are prohibited from applying\n\nfor adjustment of status.      Echevarria v.

An exception to\n\nthis general rule exists for beneficiaries of visa petitions that\n\n\n2\n The BIA denied this motion to reopen in January 2005.           It\nconcluded that Castro-Soto could not adjust status based on his\nsecond-wife's 2004 visa petition because he failed to produce clear\nand convincing evidence that his second marriage was bona fide.\nCastro-Soto did not petition for review of this decision, although\nhe did file a motion to reconsider, which the BIA denied in March\n2005. Castro-Soto did not appeal that ruling.\n\n                                   -5-\n\fwere   filed      before        April        30,     2001.        See    8    C.F.R.\n\n§ 245.10(a)(1)(i)(A), (B); Echevarria, 505 F.3d at 19. Castro-Soto\n\nclaims that because he is the beneficiary of his first wife's 1992\n\nvisa petition, he qualifies under this grandfathering provision to\n\nfile again for adjustment.\n\n           An    alien    may    qualify       for    grandfathering     if   he   is\n\nphysically present and the \"beneficiary\" of a visa petition. §\n\n245.10(a)(1)(i).        The visa petition relied upon by the alien must\n\nhave been (1) filed before April 30, 2001, (2) \"properly filed,\"\n\nand (3) \"approvable when filed\".              Id. at (a)(1)(i)(A); (a)(2)(i);\n\n(a)(3).3   If the visa petition has met these three requirements, it\n\nmay be used for grandfathering purposes even if it \"was later\n\nwithdrawn, denied, or revoked due to circumstances that have arisen\n\nafter the time of filing\".             Id. at (a)(3); see also, Echevarria,\n\n505 F.3d at 19.         The applicant bears the burden of proving his\n\neligibility for adjustment of status.                8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(d).\n\n           The BIA did not question whether the 1992 visa petition\n\nupon which Castro-Soto is relying for grandfathering purposes\n\nsatisfied 245.10's three requirements.                Rather, it concluded that\n\nCastro-Soto     could    not    rely    on    the    1992    petition   because    the\n\ngovernment had granted it, and Castro-Soto had relied upon the\n\npetition to gain conditional lawful permanent residence. The Board\n\n\n3\n To be \"approvable when filed,\" a visa petition must have been:\n\"properly filed, meritorious in fact, and non-frivolous.\" Id. at\n(a)(3).\n\n                                         -6-\n\ffurther stressed that Castro-Soto had not only adjusted his status\n\nusing his ex-wife's visa petition, but also \"later failed to obtain\n\nremoval of the conditions on his permanent residence.\"\n\n            Our review of the BIA's decision is circumscribed.         When\n\nCongress has entrusted rulemaking and administrative authority to\n\nan agency, as it has done with the INA, \"courts normally accord the\n\nagency particular deference in respect to the interpretation of\n\nregulations promulgated under that authority.\" S.

Jan. 25, 2010).    In 1994, however, Congress temporarily\n\nlifted restrictions on certain illegal aliens who sought adjustment\n\nof status.      Id.   The grandfather clause, instituted after the\n\nexpiration of this 1994 Act, \"aimed to protect those who had\n\nlegitimate visa applications on file before the more restrictive\n\namendment came into force excluding applications on behalf of those\n\nwho entered illegally.\"      Echevarria, 505 F.3d at 19.        We have\n\nobserved that it was not these applicants' fault \"that it might\n\ntake time to process applications that had been filed before the\n\nlaw changed.\" Id.\n\n           It is not an illogical corollary that an applicant's\n\ngrandfathered status should expire once he has obtained all of the\n\nbenefits available through a visa petition.        The DHS reached this\n\nvery conclusion in a 2005 policy memorandum in considering the\n\npotential for multiple filings for adjustment of status under\n\nSection 245(i):\n\n\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\f          A grandfathered alien is eligible to file an\n          application to adjust status under section\n          245(i) as long as the alien meets the\n          requirements of 8 C.F.R. 245.10 and has not\n          adjusted status under section 245(i). USCIS\n          no longer considers an alien \"grandfathered\"\n          once the alien is granted adjustment of status\n          under section 245(i), because the alien has\n          acquired   the   only  intended   benefit   of\n          grandfathering:   [Lawful Permanent Resident]\n          status.\n\n\n\nInteroffice Memorandum from William R.

Castro-\nSoto's spouse's 1992 petition was approved, and it was never\nrevoked. Indeed, although the regulations provide for automatic\nrevocation under certain circumstances -- for example, divorce --\nthis provision is only triggered when the circumstance occurs\nbefore the government's final decision on the beneficiary's\nadjustment application. 8 C.F.R. § 1205.1 (a)(3). Castro-Soto's\nadjustment of status was granted in December, 1992. He and his\nfirst wife did not divorce until 2001.\n      Nowhere do the regulations state that an approved petition, as\nopposed to one that is pending, withdrawn, denied or revoked, can\nbe used to preserve the alien's grandfathered status.

DHS's 2005 memorandum, he observes,\n\nexplains   that    the   government    \"no   longer   considers    an    alien\n\n'grandfathered' once the alien is granted adjustment of status\n\nunder Section 245(i) because the alien has acquired . . .            [Lawful\n\nPermanent Resident] status\" (emphasis added). Castro-Soto urges us\n\nto hold that because he only acquired conditional lawful permanent\n\nresident status, his 1992 visa petition is still available for\n\npurposes of grandfathering.\n\n           No     persuasive    authority    is   cited   to   support    this\n\ninterpretation, and in any event there is a significant problem\n\nwith it.   Were we to adopt Castro-Soto's view, all grandfathered\n\naliens who, because of their own lack of proof, failed to remove\n\nconditions attached to their lawful permanent resident status could\n\nsimply fling infinite subsequent petitions or applications for\n\nadjustment until one happened to stick.           Congress could not have\n\nintended such a result.        Cf. Echevarria, 505 F.3d at 19–20 (\"There\n\nis no reason to think that the grandfathering provision was meant\n\nto give a second bite at the apple to one who earlier had a full\n\nand fair opportunity to prove the marriage was bona fide.\").\n\n\nintentional.
