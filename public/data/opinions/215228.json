Peres for appellant/cross-appellee Dziemit.\r\n     Paul J. Klehm, with whom Benjamin L. Falkner and Krasnoo\r\nKlehm LLP were on brief, for appellee/cross-appellant\r\nInternational Floor Crafts, Inc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          April 21, 2011\r\n\f             STAHL, Circuit Judge.        This trio of related appeals\r\n\r\narises from a 2005 civil action brought by International Floor\r\n\r\nCrafts, Inc. (\"IFC\") for violations of the Racketeer Influenced and\r\n\r\nCorrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\"), 18 U.S.C. § 1961 et seq., and\r\n\r\nvarious Massachusetts state laws after IFC discovered a multi-\r\n\r\nmillion dollar fraudulent scheme being perpetrated against it by\r\n\r\nnumerous     individuals   and   entities.     By   mid-2008,   only   two\r\n\r\ndefendants remained in the suit — David Adams, a former employee of\r\n\r\nIFC, and Jane Dziemit, an outside business woman.         After a joint\r\n\r\nfive-day trial, the jury returned a verdict against both Adams and\r\n\r\nDziemit.\r\n\r\n             There are three appellate issues before the court, which\r\n\r\ninvolve only Dziemit and IFC.1       Dziemit argues that the denial of\r\n\r\nher motion for judgment as a matter of law was in error and that\r\n\r\nthe district court's jury instruction on common law fraud was\r\n\r\nincorrect.     IFC cross-appeals with respect to one state law claim\r\n\r\nit brought under the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act, Mass.\r\n\r\nGen. Laws ch. 93A (\"Chapter 93A\"), on which the district court\r\n\r\nrefused to enter judgment.       Lastly, Dziemit separately appeals the\r\n\r\ndistrict court's imposition of an appeal bond for $10,000. For the\r\n\r\nfollowing reasons, we affirm the district court's judgment against\r\n\r\nDziemit and its imposition of the bond, and, at IFC's request, we\r\n\r\ndecline to rule on the Chapter 93A claim.\r\n\r\n\r\n     1\r\n         Adams did not appeal the jury verdict.\r\n\r\n                                    -2-\r\n\f                              I. Background\r\n\r\n           We recite the facts in the light most favorable to the\r\n\r\njury verdict.    Anaya-Burgos v. Lasalvia-Prisco, 607 F.3d 269, 270\r\n\r\nn.1 (1st Cir. 2010).        Building 19, Inc. (\"Building 19\") is a\r\n\r\ncompany that operates fourteen retail discount stores throughout\r\n\r\nthe New England area selling a wide variety of consumer products.\r\n\r\nIFC   manages   the   rug   department   of   Building   19,   and   it    is\r\n\r\nresponsible for supplying Building 19's flooring inventory, which\r\n\r\nconsists mostly of surplus and salvage oriental rugs, indoor and\r\n\r\noutdoor rugs, remnants, padding, and wood flooring.\r\n\r\n           Because the scheme at issue involved the exploitation of\r\n\r\nIFC's business practices, we summarize briefly IFC's procedures for\r\n\r\nbuying and selling rugs.        Typically, IFC buyers negotiate with\r\n\r\noutside vendors to purchase merchandise for retail sale.              Upon\r\n\r\nplacing an order with a vendor, the IFC buyer creates a purchase\r\n\r\norder detailing the product bought, the price of the product, and\r\n\r\nthe outside vendor's information.        The buyer then provides copies\r\n\r\nof this purchase order to the vendor, an IFC warehouse, and IFC's\r\n\r\naccounts payable department.\r\n\r\n           After receiving a copy of the purchase order, the vendor\r\n\r\nsends IFC an invoice and delivers the goods to the IFC warehouse.\r\n\r\nAn IFC receiver accepts the product, and a supervisor at the\r\n\r\nwarehouse completes a receiving document termed a \"key-rec.\"              The\r\n\r\nkey-rec details the merchandise received, and the supervisor is\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   -2-\r\n\frequired to initial the document after having verified the contents\r\n\r\nof the delivery.     Once the key-rec is complete, it is sent to IFC's\r\n\r\naccounts payable department.           The accounts payable department\r\n\r\ncross-checks the corresponding purchase order, invoice, and key-\r\n\r\nrec.       If personnel see no discrepancies in the paperwork, an\r\n\r\naccounts payable manager issues payment to the vendor.\r\n\r\nA.   The Scheme\r\n\r\n             Starting sometime in the mid-1990s and lasting until\r\n\r\nApril 2005, Adams and co-conspirator Kevin Britto devised and\r\n\r\nmanaged a fraudulent scheme that duped IFC into paying out millions\r\n\r\nof dollars to various vendors based on fabricated invoices. As IFC\r\n\r\nbuyers,2 Adams and Britto prepared purchase orders for partially or\r\n\r\ncompletely fake merchandise shipments, recording on the orders an\r\n\r\nexaggerated amount of items purchased.        Britto communicated these\r\n\r\nfake purchases to Tyrone Williams, another IFC employee and the\r\n\r\nsupervisor     of   IFC's   largest   warehouse.    Williams,   in   turn,\r\n\r\ncompleted fraudulent key-recs to match the fraudulent purchase\r\n\r\norders.\r\n\r\n             Various outside vendors were brought into the scheme, and\r\n\r\nsome of these vendors were sham operations.        These outside vendors\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       2\r\n      Britto worked for IFC from July 1988 to November 1997, and\r\nagain from September 1998 to September 2001.      He continued to\r\nreceive money from the scheme even after he left IFC. Adams was\r\ninitially an outside vendor who did business with IFC, but IFC\r\nlater hired him as a buyer. Adams was terminated from IFC sometime\r\nin 2005, which precipitated the discovery of the fraud.\r\n\r\n                                      -3-\r\n\fwould send invoices to IFC that matched the phony purchase orders\r\n\r\nand key-recs, allowing the scheme to continue undetected by the\r\n\r\naccounts payable department.    Adams directed the vendors to charge\r\n\r\na specific amount on its invoices, and when IFC's accounts payable\r\n\r\ndepartment issued a check based on that amount, the vendors would\r\n\r\ndistribute approximately seventy-five percent of the ill-gotten\r\n\r\ngains to Adams, keeping the remainder for themselves.\r\n\r\n            Chinese Carpet Center, Inc. (\"CCC\") was the primary\r\n\r\nvendor that colluded with Adams and Britto.        David Sun, CCC's\r\n\r\nformer treasurer, testified at trial about the company's knowing\r\n\r\nparticipation, and he detailed the scheme's inner-workings.       He\r\n\r\nexplained that CCC was consistently required to advance to Adams\r\n\r\nlarge sums of money via cash, check, and wire transfers.    In turn,\r\n\r\nCCC would bill IFC for short or nonexistent shipments.      When CCC\r\n\r\nreceived payment from IFC, it was paid back the initially loaned\r\n\r\namount along with a profit, which was shared between CCC and Adams.\r\n\r\nSun explained that this loan system kept CCC in the scheme and made\r\n\r\nit difficult to disengage, lest CCC not recoup the money it had\r\n\r\nadvanced.\r\n\r\nB.   Dziemit's Role and the Evidence Against Her\r\n\r\n            Prior to her involvement in the scheme, Dziemit worked as\r\n\r\na mortgage lender associated with various companies, many of which\r\n\r\nwere owned and operated by her boyfriend, Tony Maresca.    Dziemit's\r\n\r\nprimary activity was the completion of loan paperwork for the\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 -4-\r\n\fcompanies, and she worked out of her home in Connecticut.                       At\r\n\r\ntimes, Dziemit would also make loans to third parties, drawing upon\r\n\r\nMaresca's mortgage companies or her own personal accounts to supply\r\n\r\nthe funds.         Each time Dziemit completed a loan, she executed a\r\n\r\nmortgage and a promissory note, and she profited from the loan\r\n\r\nbased on the interest that it accrued.\r\n\r\n               Maresca      was   a   long-time   friend   of   Ronald    Mitchell.\r\n\r\nMitchell owned and operated a carpet underlay supply business known\r\n\r\nas Remco, and later, as Mansfield Rug, which sold padding.                  At some\r\n\r\npoint in his career, Mitchell, doing business as Remco, sold\r\n\r\npadding to retail operations that he obtained from legitimate\r\n\r\nbusinesses.        His company had no employees other than himself.             In\r\n\r\n1999 or 2000, Dziemit began working with Mitchell as part of\r\n\r\nRemco,3 and she became a partner of the company for a few years.\r\n\r\nAround this time, Dziemit and Mitchell, along with Maresca, met\r\n\r\nwith       Adams   at   a   Building     19   store   to   initiate   a   business\r\n\r\nrelationship.\r\n\r\n               Mitchell and Dziemit testified at trial about their\r\n\r\ndealings with Adams and the transactions that were involved.\r\n\r\nAccording to their testimony, Adams would communicate to Mitchell\r\n\r\na specific amount of money that Mitchell, d/b/a Remco, was to lend\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       3\r\n      Evidence at trial also demonstrated that Dziemit was involved\r\nwith Mansfield Rug, a successor in name to Remco, to the extent\r\nthat she received at least two checks from the Mansfield Rug bank\r\naccount.\r\n\r\n                                          -5-\r\n\fto Adams, purportedly so that Adams could purchase rugs.      Then,\r\n\r\nAdams would send Mitchell an IFC purchase order that included a\r\n\r\ndescription of product ostensibly being supplied by Remco and the\r\n\r\namount that Remco was to charge IFC on an eventual invoice.      The\r\n\r\ninvoice amount was always greater than the loan amount, and the two\r\n\r\nfigures in no way corresponded.        Mitchell would then fax the\r\n\r\npurchase order to Dziemit and communicate to her the amount of the\r\n\r\nloan to Adams.\r\n\r\n          Dziemit, acting in her lending capacity, would lend to\r\n\r\nMitchell the money to be advanced to Adams.     Except for the first\r\n\r\nloan executed, Dziemit did not secure any notes or mortgages\r\n\r\nevidencing or securing these loans.4       Then, switching hats and\r\n\r\nacting as a Remco partner, Dziemit would advance the money to\r\n\r\nAdams, or at times, to Britto.         Many of these advances were\r\n\r\ncompleted via wire transfers.         Although Mitchell and Dziemit\r\n\r\nclaimed that Adams used this advanced money to buy the merchandise\r\n\r\nthat was listed on the purchase order and that was ostensibly being\r\n\r\nsupplied by Remco, neither of them ever saw any product that was\r\n\r\nbought or shipped, and they never sought to visit a warehouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     4\r\n      At one point in January 2001, Mitchell, not Dziemit, obtained\r\na mortgage on Adams' property.        Dziemit claimed to have an\r\nassignment on the mortgage, but she never produced this during\r\ndiscovery or at trial. Even if Dziemit had a mortgage on Adams'\r\nproperty, she did not have one on Mitchell's property, even though\r\nthe money she lent went to Mitchell, doing business as Remco.\r\n\r\n                                -6-\r\n\fBeyond the purchase order, there was no documentation that the\r\n\r\nproduct existed.\r\n\r\n             Approximately two or three weeks after Dziemit advanced\r\n\r\nmoney to Adams, Adams would alert Remco to submit an invoice to\r\n\r\nIFC.    Dziemit drafted the bulk of the invoices and either she or\r\n\r\nMitchell would mail them.            Upon receipt of the invoice, IFC would\r\n\r\nsend a check to Dziemit's post office box, or, at least one time,\r\n\r\ndirectly to Dziemit's home.              Dziemit would endorse the check from\r\n\r\nIFC and deposit it into the account from which she initially\r\n\r\nborrowed the funds, which could have been her personal account or\r\n\r\nthe account of one of Maresca's companies; Dziemit did not keep\r\n\r\ngood    records,   and    many      of   the   transactions         were   recorded   as\r\n\r\nhandwritten notations on various papers.                   Dziemit would then send\r\n\r\nAdams    a   portion   of     the   profit       and    share     the   remainder   with\r\n\r\nMitchell.     At no time throughout her involvement was Dziemit ever\r\n\r\nactually     engaged     in   the    sale      of      padding,    Remco's   purported\r\n\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n             When Dziemit testified at trial, she walked the jury\r\n\r\nthrough a sample transaction, using a $25,000 loan she made to\r\n\r\nMitchell and then advanced to Adams on November 18, 1999.                             On\r\n\r\nJanuary 19, 2000, approximately two months later, Dziemit received\r\n\r\nan invoice payment from IFC for $41,550.04.                       She deposited that\r\n\r\namount into one of her mortgage accounts, wired just over $10,000\r\n\r\nto Adams as his share of the profit, and split the remainder of the\r\n\r\n\r\n                                           -7-\r\n\fgains with Mitchell.    Dziemit personally profited $2915.28 from\r\n\r\nthis loan.   She agreed that this transaction indicated what would\r\n\r\nhave been a 66 percent interest rate on an annual basis for the\r\n\r\n$25,000 loan, much more than what she would have earned on a\r\n\r\ntypical secured mortgage loan.5\r\n\r\n          Sometime in late 2001, Dziemit ceased being a partner in\r\n\r\nRemco.   She did, however, continue to loan funds to Mitchell, and\r\n\r\nthese loans, along with a profit, were repaid to her.      She also\r\n\r\nreceived money both during the time she was a partner and later,\r\n\r\nthrough 2003, even when she did not advance any funds.    In total,\r\n\r\nDziemit completed approximately 35 transactions for Remco, and each\r\n\r\ntransaction took less than an hour.     She estimated that for these\r\n\r\n35 hours of work, she made approximately $130,000.\r\n\r\n          Dziemit admitted at trial that these transactions were a\r\n\r\ndeparture from her normal course of business.     Dziemit had never\r\n\r\nbefore lent money to one of her business partners, nor had she ever\r\n\r\nlent money without receiving security.    Dziemit estimated that she\r\n\r\nadvanced a total of approximately $1.4 million to Mitchell for the\r\n\r\ntransactions.    Apparently, of the total amount lent, she had\r\n\r\nsecurity for only $40,000.   Further, never before in her business\r\n\r\ndid Dziemit earn money from a loan based on a profit, rather than\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     5\r\n      As explained to the jury, Dziemit's payment represented\r\napproximately 11 percent of the loaned $25,000, which, extrapolated\r\nto a yearly rate, demonstrated that Dziemit would have made 66\r\npercent on the loan.\r\n\r\n                                  -8-\r\n\fon the accrued interest.        Indeed, in all of her previous lending\r\n\r\nactivities, Dziemit knew the percentage she would earn on a loan,\r\n\r\nbut with respect to the loans to Mitchell, she did not know how\r\n\r\nmuch she would earn on a particular loan at the time she made the\r\n\r\nadvance.       Additionally, there was no relationship between the\r\n\r\namount Dziemit advanced and the ultimate profit that she earned.\r\n\r\nC.    The Discovery of the Fraud and the Subsequent Suit\r\n\r\n              In March 2005, IFC terminated Adams for poor performance.\r\n\r\nThe   buyer     hired   to   replace    Adams    began    to     notice   various\r\n\r\ndiscrepancies     between    purchases       Adams   allegedly    made    and   the\r\n\r\nproduct available for retail sale.            After delving through records,\r\n\r\nthe new buyer contacted Mitchell about several missing deliveries\r\n\r\nostensibly from Mansfield Rug.         Mitchell, trying to stave off any\r\n\r\ninquiries into the transactions, forwarded a fake bill of lading\r\n\r\nthat he created with the help of Britto.             He also misled the buyer\r\n\r\ninto believing that he had a warehouse full of goods and that other\r\n\r\ndocuments related to any deliveries were destroyed and therefore\r\n\r\nunavailable for verification.           Around this time, IFC's accounts\r\n\r\npayable    department    performed     an    internal    investigation,     which\r\n\r\nultimately uncovered the scheme. The department determined that it\r\n\r\nhad paid almost $10 million in fraudulent invoices from Remco,\r\n\r\nMansfield Rug, and CCC.\r\n\r\n              On August 10, 2005, IFC brought suit against Adams,\r\n\r\nBritto, Williams, CCC and its officers, Mitchell, and Dziemit,\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       -9-\r\n\famong many others, for violations of RICO and Massachusetts state\r\n\r\nlaw.    In 2006, it settled with CCC and its officers and employees.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, it filed a suggestion of apparent death as to Britto, who\r\n\r\nhad been suffering from a grave liver disease.    Prior to Britto's\r\n\r\ndeath, IFC videotaped his deposition, wherein Britto confessed to\r\n\r\nthe scheme, implicated Adams and Williams, and denied the knowing\r\n\r\ninvolvement of Dziemit and Mitchell.     In 2008, an agreement for\r\n\r\njudgment was entered against Mitchell for over $3 million, and\r\n\r\ndefault judgment was entered against Williams.    By July 21, 2008,\r\n\r\nonly Dziemit and Adams remained to stand trial for the following\r\n\r\nclaims: (1) violations of RICO; (2) conspiracy to violate RICO;\r\n\r\n(3) common law fraud; and (4) as to Adams only, breach of fiduciary\r\n\r\nduty.    The district court reserved for itself IFC's Chapter 93A\r\n\r\nclaim against Dziemit and Adams.\r\n\r\n            On July 29, 2009, the district court charged the jury,\r\n\r\nand the following day, the jury returned its verdict.      It found\r\n\r\nboth Adams and Dziemit liable to IFC for violations of RICO and\r\n\r\ncommon law fraud.   It further found Adams, but not Dziemit, to have\r\n\r\nengaged in conspiracy to violate RICO, and it found Adams liable\r\n\r\nfor breach of fiduciary duty.    The jury awarded IFC $5 million in\r\n\r\ndamages against Adams, and $250,000 against Dziemit.    Pursuant to\r\n\r\nthe RICO statute, the district court trebled these damages and\r\n\r\nawarded IFC $522,281 in costs, including attorneys' fees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 -10-\r\n\f              A flurry of post-trial motions ensued, only some of which\r\n\r\nare relevant for present purposes. IFC moved for entry of judgment\r\n\r\nagainst Adams and Dziemit on the Chapter 93A count.           The district\r\n\r\ncourt denied the motion in an electronic order issued that same\r\n\r\nday, stating, \"Because full damages were determined by the jury and\r\n\r\ntrebled by the Court pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), the Chapter\r\n\r\n93A claim is rendered duplicative and redundant and plaintiff's\r\n\r\nmotion is denied.\"       IFC sought reconsideration, which the district\r\n\r\ncourt also denied.\r\n\r\n              Thereafter, Dziemit renewed her motion for judgment as a\r\n\r\nmatter of law, for which she initially moved at the close of IFC's\r\n\r\ncase-in-chief and at the close of trial, arguing that there was\r\n\r\ninsufficient evidence to find that she knowingly and willfully\r\n\r\nengaged in any fraud, or was willfully blind to the scheme.               The\r\n\r\ndistrict court denied this motion as well.\r\n\r\n              In her subsequent appeal, Dziemit now argues that IFC\r\n\r\nfailed   to    present   sufficient    evidence   to   establish   that   she\r\n\r\nknowingly and willfully committed two or more acts of mail and/or\r\n\r\nwire fraud, rendering the RICO and common law fraud verdicts void.\r\n\r\nShe also argues that the district court erred in providing the jury\r\n\r\nwith a \"willful blindness\" instruction as to the common law fraud\r\n\r\nclaim, and, to the extent that the instruction was proper, there\r\n\r\nwas still insufficient evidence to prove that she was willfully\r\n\r\nblind.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      -11-\r\n\f           IFC cross-appealed. It argues that although the district\r\n\r\ncourt was correct to reserve the Chapter 93A claim for itself, the\r\n\r\ncourt erroneously denied IFC's motion for judgment on the claim\r\n\r\nbecause IFC presented sufficient evidence to support it.\r\n\r\n           Lastly, Dziemit appeals the district court's order that\r\n\r\nshe post an appeal bond that includes attorneys' fees as \"costs on\r\n\r\nappeal.\"   IFC sought a bond pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate\r\n\r\nProcedure 7, after Dziemit filed her notice of appeal, to ensure\r\n\r\npayment of its appellate costs, including attorneys' fees.      The\r\n\r\ndistrict court granted IFC's motion and required Dziemit to post a\r\n\r\nbond for $10,000, of which $5000 was meant to cover appellate fees.\r\n\r\n           Because we find that IFC presented sufficient evidence to\r\n\r\nsupport the jury's verdict that Dziemit violated RICO and committed\r\n\r\ncommon law fraud, and because we find no plain error in the\r\n\r\ndistrict court's jury instructions, we affirm the judgment against\r\n\r\nDziemit.    Because we affirm the judgment against Dziemit, we\r\n\r\ndecline to rule on IFC's Chapter 93A claim at IFC's request.\r\n\r\nLastly, we affirm the issuance of the appeal bond and hold that an\r\n\r\nappeal bond may include appellate attorneys' fees if the applicable\r\n\r\nstatute underlying the litigation contains a fee-shifting provision\r\n\r\nthat accounts for such fees in its definition of recoverable costs\r\n\r\nand the appellee is eligible to recover them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                -12-\r\n\f                                   II. Analysis\r\n\r\nA.   Dziemit's Appeal in Relation to the Jury Trial and Verdict\r\n\r\n           We review de novo a district court's denial of a renewed\r\n\r\nmotion for judgment as a matter of law.

Under   such\r\n\r\ncircumstances, we examine the evidence \"in the light most favorable\r\n\r\nto the verdict and may reverse only if no reasonable person could\r\n\r\nhave reached the conclusion arrived at by the jury.\"                     Id.

RICO\r\n\r\n           To    succeed     on    a   civil   RICO   claim      under    18   U.S.C.\r\n\r\n§ 1962(c), a plaintiff must prove: \"'(1) conduct, (2) of an\r\n\r\nenterprise, (3) through a pattern, (4) of racketeering activity.'\"\r\n\r\nKenda Corp. v.

Mail or wire fraud requires proof of: (1) a scheme\r\n\r\nto defraud, (2) knowing and willful participation in the scheme\r\n\r\nwith the intent to defraud, and (3) the use of the mails or\r\n\r\ninterstate wire in furtherance of the scheme. Bonilla v. Volvo Car\r\n\r\nCorp., 150 F.3d 62, 66 (1st Cir. 1998).\r\n\r\n            Dziemit does not challenge that IFC proved the existence\r\n\r\nof a scheme to defraud or that Dziemit used the mails or interstate\r\n\r\nwire in furtherance of the scheme.        She argues only that IFC failed\r\n\r\nto prove that she knowingly and willfully committed mail or wire\r\n\r\nfraud, asserting that she was a peripheral participant and unaware\r\n\r\nof her complicity.      She states that the lack of direct evidence\r\n\r\nattesting   to   her   knowledge   coupled    with   her   own   exculpatory\r\n\r\ntestimony and that of Britto demonstrates that a reasonable juror\r\n\r\ncould not have found her liable under RICO.\r\n\r\n            We reject Dziemit's contention. A review of the evidence\r\n\r\nin the light most favorable to IFC demonstrates that IFC presented\r\n\r\nsufficient evidence for a jury to conclude by a preponderance of\r\n\r\nthe evidence that Dziemit knowingly and willfully participated in\r\n\r\ndefrauding IFC.    First, the jury heard testimony from Mitchell and\r\n\r\nDavid Sun from which it could infer Dziemit's knowledge. Mitchell,\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   -14-\r\n\fDziemit's partner, admitted that he agreed to a judgment against\r\n\r\nhimself and that he lied to IFC in an attempt to stave off\r\n\r\ninquiries into his companies' dealings.                  David Sun admitted to\r\n\r\nCCC's complicity and described in terms strikingly similar to\r\n\r\nDziemit that it was required to advance large sums of money to\r\n\r\nAdams via wire transfers and checks, and that it would make a\r\n\r\nprofit on these advances once IFC paid its invoices.\r\n\r\n            Second,    the   evidence     demonstrated       that    Dziemit      was\r\n\r\ninvolved from the start in the transactions between Remco and\r\n\r\nAdams.   Dziemit, along with Mitchell and Maresca, met Adams at a\r\n\r\nBuilding 19 store to initiate their dealings, and she continued to\r\n\r\nconduct transactions with Adams for approximately three years.\r\n\r\n            Third,    Dziemit,   a   Remco    partner      purportedly       in   the\r\n\r\nbusiness of selling rug padding, advanced large sums of money to\r\n\r\nAdams, a buyer of rug products. Further, she acknowledged that she\r\n\r\nnever saw a Remco warehouse or any product it allegedly sold.\r\n\r\nAlthough she drafted and sent invoices to IFC, she never had any\r\n\r\nverification,   apart    from    Adams'     word    as   told   to    her   through\r\n\r\nMitchell, that any rugs were being delivered to IFC.\r\n\r\n            Fourth, and perhaps most significant, Dziemit admitted to\r\n\r\nthe unusual nature of her profits and her dealings with Adams and\r\n\r\nMitchell.     Dziemit    advanced    money     to    Mitchell,       her    business\r\n\r\npartner, and then, in turn, advanced that money to Adams, the\r\n\r\nostensible buyer, often through wire transfers or checks. She lent\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     -15-\r\n\fthis money from and deposited money back into various accounts,\r\n\r\nincluding    both     business       and    personal      accounts,    and    she   kept\r\n\r\nhaphazard records.        Dziemit advanced a total of approximately $1.4\r\n\r\nmillion to Mitchell but had only $40,000 secured. She earned money\r\n\r\nnot from the interest rate of the loans she provided, but from a\r\n\r\nprofit realized upon charging IFC an amount that had no relation to\r\n\r\nthe   initial    loan.        Were    these      profits    interpreted      as   earned\r\n\r\ninterest, they would be considerably higher than any typical\r\n\r\ninterest rate earned on a mortgage.                  In total, Dziemit was paid\r\n\r\n$130,000 for approximately 35 hours of work, less than a typical\r\n\r\nworkweek.       She was compensated even when she was no longer a\r\n\r\npartner and even when she did not advance any money.\r\n\r\n            This      evidence,      when     viewed      in   the    aggregate,    was\r\n\r\nsufficient      for     the   jury    to    conclude       that   Dziemit     knowingly\r\n\r\ncommitted two or more acts of mail or wire fraud.                    See Bourjaily v.\r\n\r\nUnited States, 483 U.S. 171, 179-80 (1987) (\"[I]ndividual pieces of\r\n\r\nevidence, insufficient in themselves to prove a point, may in\r\n\r\ncumulation      prove    it.\").       To    be    sure,    Dziemit's    and    Britto's\r\n\r\ntestimony claimed, unsurprisingly, that Dziemit did not knowingly\r\n\r\nengage in the scheme, but the abundant circumstantial evidence at\r\n\r\ntrial permitted the jury to make a contrary inference.                       See United\r\n\r\nStates v. Boylan, 898 F.2d 230, 242 (1st Cir. 1990) (noting that a\r\n\r\nparty may \"'prove its case through the use of circumstantial\r\n\r\nevidence so long as the total evidence, including reasonable\r\n\r\n\r\n                                           -16-\r\n\finferences, is sufficient to warrant a jury to conclude that the\r\n\r\ndefendant is guilty'\" (quoting United States v. Campa, 679 F.2d\r\n\r\n1006, 1010 (1st Cir. 1982))).\r\n\r\n            In support of her argument, Dziemit contends for the\r\n\r\nfirst time on appeal that the evidence regarding her knowing and\r\n\r\nwillful participation in the scheme is further undermined by the\r\n\r\njury's verdict, which did not find her liable for conspiring to\r\n\r\nviolate RICO.      She asserts that if the jury did not find her to\r\n\r\nhave knowingly joined a conspiracy, then it could not have found\r\n\r\nher to have knowingly and willfully committed fraud.\r\n\r\n            This    argument      is   a    dead       end.     \"Objections     to    the\r\n\r\ninconsistency of verdicts must be made after the verdict is read\r\n\r\nand before the jury is discharged.\"                Babcock v.

Failure      to    object   timely         renders      the   claim   waived   or\r\n\r\nforfeited   and,    at    most,    subject        to    only   plain   error   review.\r\n\r\nBabcock,    299    F.3d   at   63-64       (applying      plain      error   review   to\r\n\r\nunpreserved inconsistent verdict claim deemed forfeited); see also\r\n\r\nUphoff Figueroa v.

Under plain error review, we reverse only\r\n\r\nif (1) there is an error, (2) that was obvious and clear under\r\n\r\ncurrent law, (3) that affected substantial rights, and (4) that\r\n\r\nthreatened a miscarriage of justice.         Babcock, 299 F.3d at 64-65.\r\n\r\nPlain error is strictly applied in civil cases, and we will grant\r\n\r\nrelief \"only to prevent a clear miscarriage of justice or where the\r\n\r\nerror   seriously    affected    the   fairness,     integrity     or   public\r\n\r\nreputation of judicial proceedings.\"         Id. at 65 (quoting Romano v.\r\n\r\nU-Haul Int'l, 233 F.3d 655, 664 (1st Cir. 2000)) (internal marks\r\n\r\nomitted).    Dziemit does not even attempt to demonstrate how her\r\n\r\nclaim meets this standard, nor do we see how it could.\r\n\r\n            2. Common Law Fraud\r\n\r\n            Dziemit next argues that IFC failed to present sufficient\r\n\r\nevidence to support its common law fraud claim.             To prove fraud\r\n\r\nunder Massachusetts law, a plaintiff must show that \"the defendant\r\n\r\n'made a false representation of material fact with knowledge of its\r\n\r\nfalsity for the purpose of inducing the plaintiff to act thereon,\r\n\r\nand that the plaintiff reasonably relied upon the representation as\r\n\r\ntrue and acted upon it to his damage.'\"            Taylor v. Am. Chemistry\r\n\r\nCouncil, 576 F.3d 16, 31 (1st Cir. 2009) (quoting Russell v. Cooley\r\n\r\nDickinson Hosp., Inc., 772 N.E.2d 1054, 1066 (Mass. 2002)).                At\r\n\r\ntrial, the district court instructed the jury that it could infer\r\n\r\nDziemit's knowledge from circumstantial evidence or, as to the\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     -18-\r\n\ffraud claim only, from evidence that showed willful blindness.\r\n\r\nUnder a willful blindness formulation, the defendant does not need\r\n\r\nto actually know that the statements she made were false if the\r\n\r\nfalsity is \"susceptible of actual knowledge.\"               See Kozdras v.\r\n\r\nLand/Vest Props., Inc., 413 N.E.2d 1105, 1111 (Mass. 1980).\r\n\r\n            IFC's theory of the case was that Dziemit was liable for\r\n\r\nfraud for the same reason that she was liable under RICO, because\r\n\r\nshe knowingly submitted false invoices to IFC.         In turn, Dziemit\r\n\r\nasserts on appeal that IFC's evidence was inadequate to sustain its\r\n\r\nfraud claim for the same reasons she stated in challenging the RICO\r\n\r\njudgment,    that   is,   that   the   evidence   against    her   did   not\r\n\r\ndemonstrate that she actually knew that the invoices she sent to\r\n\r\nIFC were fraudulent.      Further, she claims that, to the extent that\r\n\r\nthe court properly instructed the jury that knowledge as to common\r\n\r\nlaw fraud could be proved by willful blindness (which she contests\r\n\r\non appeal), the evidence did not indicate that she was willfully\r\n\r\nblind to her fraud since not even IFC was able to discover the\r\n\r\nscheme until almost ten years after it began.\r\n\r\n            Dziemit's challenge to the fraud claim unravels in view\r\n\r\nof our conclusion that the evidence at trial reasonably supported\r\n\r\na finding of RICO liability.      As we explained in our determination\r\n\r\nof Dziemit's RICO argument, a jury could have reasonably inferred\r\n\r\nfrom the circumstantial evidence that Dziemit actually knew that\r\n\r\nthe invoices she mailed to IFC were fraudulent.              This alone is\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   -19-\r\n\fsufficient to sustain the fraud claim, as the jury needed to find\r\n\r\nonly actual knowledge or willful blindness to deem Dziemit liable\r\n\r\nfor fraud.\r\n\r\n          3. Willful Blindness Instruction\r\n\r\n          Dziemit claims that the district court erred in supplying\r\n\r\nthe jury with a willful blindness instruction for the common law\r\n\r\nfraud claim.6   She argues, first, and with no citation to case law,\r\n\r\nthat the instruction is improper in the civil context and instead\r\n\r\nis reserved solely for criminal matters.        Second, parroting her\r\n\r\nsufficiency of the evidence argument, she contends that even if the\r\n\r\ninstruction was not in error as a matter of law, it was improper in\r\n\r\nthis case because there was not \"'record evidence reveal[ing]\r\n\r\n'flags'   of    suspicion   that,    uninvestigated,   suggest   willful\r\n\r\nblindness.'\"    See United States v. Epstein, 426 F.3d 431, 440 (1st\r\n\r\nCir. 2005) (quoting United States v. Coviello, 225 F.3d 54, 70 (1st\r\n\r\nCir. 2000)).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     6\r\n      The relevant portion of the common law fraud instruction was\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n          [T]he defendant then under consideration is\r\n          liable if he or she made a false statement of\r\n          fact knowing it to be false. You may infer\r\n          such knowledge from circumstantial evidence or\r\n          from evidence showing willful blindness of\r\n          that person. If you find that a person had a\r\n          strong suspicion but shut his or her eyes for\r\n          fear of what he or she might learn, you may\r\n          conclude that that person acted knowingly.\r\n\r\n                                    -20-\r\n\f          Dziemit raises this issue for the first time on appeal,\r\n\r\nand so we review only for plain error.7      See Fed. R. Civ. P.\r\n\r\n51(d)(2); Ji v. Bose Corp., 626 F.3d 116, 125 (1st Cir. 2010).\r\n\r\nHere, we need not consider whether any error occurred because even\r\n\r\nif it did, it was harmless.8      As is evident from the jury's\r\n\r\n\r\n     7\r\n      Dziemit claims to have objected below to the willful\r\nblindness instruction for common law fraud. She is wrong. The\r\nrecord demonstrates unambiguously that she did not object to this\r\ninstruction at the charge conference or at any time after the\r\ninstruction was given to the jury. Indeed, the only issue as to\r\nthe willful blindness instruction arose from whether it could be\r\nused to support liability under RICO, for which IFC advocated and\r\nwhich the district court rejected (an issue not raised on appeal).\r\nIndeed, Dziemit's trial counsel stated that he did not believe the\r\ninstruction was proper for the RICO claim, but that it was\r\nappropriate for the common law fraud count because for \"fraud --\r\nthere is language in cases, I think, that allows a lower standard,\r\nif you will, which is this willful blindness, where you may know\r\nsomething but you basically take the position, I don't want to know\r\nwhat it is that's going on.\"\r\n     8\r\n      We note, however, that Massachusetts appears to support a\r\nwillful blindness instruction in civil fraud suits.           The\r\nMassachusetts Superior Court Civil Practice Jury Instructions for\r\nintentional misrepresentation read:\r\n\r\n          The defendant is liable if [he/she] made a\r\n          false statement of fact, knowing it to be\r\n          false.   Likewise, if the defendant made an\r\n          unqualified statement about facts, the truth\r\n          or falsity of which the defendant could have\r\n          determined with certainty, and gave the\r\n          plaintiff the reasonable impression that\r\n          [he/she] was speaking of [his/her] own\r\n          knowledge, then the defendant is not excused\r\n          from liability if [he/she] did not in fact\r\n          know whether that statement was true or false.\r\n          The law regards such willful disregard of the\r\n          facts   as  equivalent   to   an   intentional\r\n          misrepresentation. Actual intent to deceive\r\n          need not be proven.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               -21-\r\n\fdetermination that Dziemit was liable for violating RICO, it found\r\n\r\nthat Dziemit actually knew that she engaged in mail and/or wire\r\n\r\nfraud.    The jury, then, did not need to rely on the willful\r\n\r\nblindness instruction to reach its verdict on the fraud claim; its\r\n\r\nfinding of liability would have been the same even without the\r\n\r\ninstruction.\r\n\r\nB.   IFC's Cross-Appeal in Relation to its Chapter 93A Claim\r\n\r\n           On its cross-appeal, IFC argues that the district court\r\n\r\nerred in denying its motion for entry of judgment against Dziemit\r\n\r\non its Chapter 93A claim.    It seeks a remand to the district court\r\n\r\nto make findings, or a ruling from this court on the merits.\r\n\r\n           During oral argument, this court asked counsel for IFC\r\n\r\nwhether it wished to pursue its Chapter 93A claim in the event that\r\n\r\nthe court upheld the jury verdict against Dziemit.                Although\r\n\r\ncounsel indicated during argument that it would still seek the\r\n\r\nclaim's   resolution,   it   reversed   its   position   in   a     letter\r\n\r\nsubsequently mailed to the court. In view of IFC's stance, because\r\n\r\nwe affirm the judgment against Dziemit based on the jury verdict,\r\n\r\nwe decline to address its Chapter 93A claim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMass. Super. Ct. Civil Practice Jury Instr. § 20.1.4; see also,\r\ne.g., Kozdras, 413 N.E.2d at 1111 (\"'[I]f a statement of fact which\r\nis susceptible of actual knowledge is made as of one's own\r\nknowledge and is false, it may be the basis for an action of deceit\r\nwithout proof of an actual intent to deceive.'\" (quoting Pietrazak\r\nv. McDermott, 167 N.E.2d 166, 168 (Mass. 1960)).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 -22-\r\n\fC.   Dziemit's Appeal in Relation to the Appeal Bond\r\n\r\n           Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 7 states, \"In a civil\r\n\r\ncase, the district court may require an appellant to file a bond or\r\n\r\nprovide other security in any form and amount necessary to ensure\r\n\r\npayment of costs on appeal.\"    Fed. R. App. P. 7.      IFC moved in the\r\n\r\ndistrict court for such a bond after Dziemit filed her notice of\r\n\r\nappeal, asking that Dziemit be required to post $30,000 to cover\r\n\r\n$5000 of IFC's anticipated expenses and $25,000 of its appellate\r\n\r\nattorneys' fees.   IFC argued that the inclusion of attorneys' fees\r\n\r\nin a Rule 7 bond is proper when           the statute underlying the\r\n\r\nlitigation   contains   a   fee-shifting    provision    that   includes\r\n\r\nattorneys' fees as part of costs awardable, as RICO does.            The\r\n\r\ndistrict court granted IFC's motion and ordered Dziemit to post an\r\n\r\nappeal bond of $10,000 within fifteen days.       In doing so, it did\r\n\r\nnot adopt IFC's reasoning and instead held that because Dziemit's\r\n\r\nappeal bore \"the indicia of frivolousness,\" the bond could include\r\n\r\nfees as part of the costs on appeal.\r\n\r\n           Dziemit appealed the district court order and did not\r\n\r\npost the bond by the deadline.          Thereafter, the parties filed\r\n\r\nseveral motions, both in district court and in this court, related\r\n\r\nto the bond.    Dziemit sought to stay the bond, IFC sought to\r\n\r\ndismiss Dziemit's appeals for her failure to post the bond, IFC\r\n\r\nsought to stay the merits appeals pending resolution of the bond\r\n\r\nappeal, and IFC moved for a briefing extension in view of the\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 -23-\r\n\fappeal bond issue.     This court issued an order on November 17,\r\n\r\n2009, denying Dziemit's motion to stay the bond and IFC's motions\r\n\r\nto stay or dismiss the appeals.             We granted IFC's motion for a\r\n\r\nbriefing extension and directed the parties to address the circuit\r\n\r\nsplit concerning the inclusion of attorneys' fees in an appeal\r\n\r\nbond.\r\n\r\n           We review for abuse of discretion a district court's\r\n\r\nimposition of an appeal bond, including its view that an appeal is\r\n\r\nfrivolous.   Sckolnick v. Harlow, 820 F.2d 13, 15 (1st Cir. 1987).\r\n\r\nWhether attorneys' fees may be part of the \"costs on appeal\" under\r\n\r\nRule 7, however, presents a question of law accorded de novo\r\n\r\nreview.    See Riva v. Ficco, 615 F.3d 35, 40 (1st Cir. 2010);\r\n\r\nAdsani v. Miller, 139 F.3d 67, 71 (2d Cir. 1998).\r\n\r\n           In accounting for attorneys' fees in the appeal bond, the\r\n\r\ndistrict court relied on our opinion in Sckolnick v. Harlow, 820\r\n\r\nF.2d 13.     There, we found a district court did not abuse its\r\n\r\ndiscretion   by   including   fees    in    a   bond   because   it   concluded\r\n\r\nimpliedly that \"the appeal might be frivolous and . . . an award of\r\n\r\nsanctions against plaintiff on appeal was a real possibility.\" Id.\r\n\r\nat 15.    Here, however, we need not evaluate the district court's\r\n\r\nfinding of frivolity because we affirm the issuance of the bond on\r\n\r\nan alternative ground.    See P.R. Ports Auth. v. Umpierre-Solares,\r\n\r\n456 F.3d 220, 224 (1st Cir.    2006) (\"We may affirm a district court\r\n\r\ndecision on any ground supported by the record.\").           In doing so, we\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     -24-\r\n\fendorse the majority view that a Rule 7 bond may include appellate\r\n\r\nattorneys' fees if the applicable statute underlying the litigation\r\n\r\ncontains a fee-shifting provision that accounts for such fees in\r\n\r\nits definition of recoverable costs and the appellee is eligible to\r\n\r\nrecover them.    See Azizian v. Federated Dep't Stores, Inc., 499\r\n\r\nF.3d 950 (9th Cir. 2007); In re Cardizem CD Antitrust Litig., 391\r\n\r\nF.3d 812 (6th Cir. 2004); Pedraza v. United Guar. Corp., 313 F.3d\r\n\r\n1323 (11th Cir. 2002); Adsani, 139 F.3d 67.\r\n\r\n           As the Second, Sixth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits have\r\n\r\nfound, there are several reasons to support our holding.           First,\r\n\r\nRule 7 does not define the term \"costs on appeal.\"           Although the\r\n\r\nAmerican rule establishes that each party to a litigation is\r\n\r\nresponsible for paying its own attorneys' fees, several statutes\r\n\r\nenacted prior to both the 1968 adoption of the Federal Rules of\r\n\r\nAppellate Procedure and the 1979 amendment to Rule 7 contain\r\n\r\nexceptions to the American rule and define costs recoverable to\r\n\r\ninclude fees.9    See Marek v. Chesny, 473 U.S. 1, 7-8 (1985).\r\n\r\nCourts   understand   these   fee-shifting   statutes   to   account   for\r\n\r\nappellate fees as well.        Azizian, 499 F.3d at 958; see also\r\n\r\nFarmington Dowel Prods. Co. v. Forster Mfg. Co., 421 F.2d 61, 91 &\r\n\r\nn.2 (1st Cir. 1970) (noting that Clayton Act, which includes fee-\r\n\r\n\r\n     9\r\n      At the adoption of the Rules, Rule 7 required an appellant to\r\nfile a bond in the fixed amount of $250. An amendment in 1979\r\neliminated the requirement and left the bond issuance and amount to\r\nthe discretion of the district court.      See Fed. R. App. P. 7\r\nadvisory committee's note (1979).\r\n\r\n                                  -25-\r\n\fshifting provision comparable to RICO, allows a plaintiff to\r\n\r\nrecover appellate fees if he sustains on appeal a district court\r\n\r\njudgment of a violation).        It is presumed that the Rule drafters\r\n\r\nwere aware of these statutes and understood \"costs\" under Rule 7 to\r\n\r\nprovide for these fees when applicable.              See Adsani, 139 F.3d at\r\n\r\n73; see also Marek, 473 U.S. at 8-9.\r\n\r\n             Supreme Court precedent supports this view.         In Marek v.\r\n\r\nChesney, 473 U.S. 1, the Court interpreted \"costs\" as stated in\r\n\r\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 6810 to encompass attorneys' fees\r\n\r\nwhen a fee-shifting statute included the fees as part of the\r\n\r\nrecoverable costs.       It explained:\r\n\r\n             [G]iven the importance of \"costs\" to the Rule,\r\n             it is very unlikely that this omission [of a\r\n             definition of \"costs\"] was mere oversight; on\r\n             the contrary, the most reasonable inference is\r\n             that the term \"costs\" in Rule 68 was intended\r\n             to refer to all costs properly awardable under\r\n             the relevant substantive statute or other\r\n             authority.\r\n\r\nId.    at 9.\r\n\r\n             Second,     our   holding   is   not     contrary   to    Federal\r\n\r\nRule    of   Appellate    Procedure   39.     Rule    39,   entitled   \"Costs\"\r\n\r\nestablishes: (a) against whom costs may be assessed, (b) the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       10\r\n      Rule 68 controls offers of judgment.         For offers not\r\naccepted, \"If the judgment that the offeree finally obtains is not\r\nmore favorable than the unaccepted offer, the offeree must pay the\r\ncosts incurred after the offer was made.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 68(d)\r\n(2010).   In Marek, the Court found that these \"costs\" include\r\nattorneys' fees when the relevant statute underlying the litigation\r\ndefined awardable costs as both costs and fees. 473 U.S at 8-9.\r\n\r\n                                      -26-\r\n\fcircumstances under which costs may be assessed for or against the\r\n\r\nUnited States, (c) costs for brief and appendix copies, (d) the\r\n\r\nprocedure for claiming costs, and (e) costs on appeal that are\r\n\r\ntaxable in the district court.       Dziemit argues that the list of\r\n\r\ntaxable costs in subdivision (e), which does not include attorneys'\r\n\r\nfees,11 defines \"costs\" for Rule 7 purposes and limits the universe\r\n\r\nof costs that may be awarded on appeal.      We are unconvinced.    No\r\n\r\npart of Rule 39 purports to define costs; each concerns only the\r\n\r\nprocedures for taxing them.     Adsani, 139 F.3d at 74.   Further, the\r\n\r\nRule does not limit \"costs on appeal\" under Rule 7.       The advisory\r\n\r\ncommittee's note at the adoption of the Rules explains that \"[t]he\r\n\r\ncosts described in [Rule 39(e)] are costs of the appeal and, as\r\n\r\nsuch, are within the undertaking of the appeal bond.\"     Fed. R. App.\r\n\r\nP. 39(e) advisory committee's note (1967) (emphasis added).         We\r\n\r\nunderstand this to mean that the costs delineated in Rule 39(e)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     11\r\n          Rule 39(e) reads:\r\n\r\n             The following costs on appeal are taxable in\r\n             the district court for the benefit of the\r\n             party entitled to costs under this rule:\r\n\r\n             (1)   the preparation and transmission of the\r\n                   record;\r\n             (2)   the reporter's transcript, if needed to\r\n                   determine the appeal;\r\n             (3)   premiums paid for a supersedeas bond or\r\n                   other bond to preserve rights pending\r\n                   appeal; and\r\n             (4)   the fee for filing the notice of appeal.\r\n\r\n                                  -27-\r\n\f\"are among, but not necessarily the only, costs available on\r\n\r\nappeal\" or for a bond.         Azizian, 499 F.3d at 958.12\r\n\r\n               Third, although two cases, one from the D.C. Circuit and\r\n\r\none from the Third Circuit, have found Rule 39(e) to restrict the\r\n\r\ncosts     calculable     for   Rule   7   purposes,   the    cases   presented\r\n\r\ndistinguishable circumstances since neither involved a fee-shifting\r\n\r\nstatute.       Adsani, 139 F.3d at 73-74; see In re Am. Presidential\r\n\r\nLines, Inc., 779 F.2d 714 (D.C. Cir. 1985); Hirschensohn, 1997 U.S.\r\n\r\nApp. LEXIS 13793, at *7 (finding Virgin Island statute did not\r\n\r\nprovide for appellate attorneys' fees). Moreover, the D.C. Circuit\r\n\r\nhas since concluded that Rule 39 \"costs\" taxable in the district\r\n\r\ncourt     do   include   appellate    attorneys'   fees     when   the   statute\r\n\r\nunderlying the appeal allows the recovery of the fees as part of\r\n\r\ncosts. See Montgomery & Assocs., Inc. v. Commodity Futures Trading\r\n\r\nComm'n, 816 F.2d 783, 784 (D.C. Cir. 1987).\r\n\r\n               Applied here, we find no error of law in the inclusion\r\n\r\nof attorneys' fees for Dziemit's Rule 7 bond.                 Under the RICO\r\n\r\nstatute, \"Any person injured in his business or property by reason\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     12\r\n      We acknowledge that earlier editions of some treatises stated\r\nthat attorneys' fees were outside the scope of a Rule 7 bond.   See\r\nHirschensohn v. Lawyers Title Ins. Corp., No. 96-7312, 1997 U.S.\r\nApp. LEXIS 13793, at *6 (3d Cir. June 10, 1997) (unpublished)\r\n(citing   20   James   Wm.   Moore,   et   al.,   Moore's   Federal\r\nPractice, § 339.41 (3d ed. 1997); 16A Charles Alan Wright & Arthur\r\nR. Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure § 3953 (2d ed. 1996)).\r\nMore recent editions, however, merely acknowledge the circuit split\r\nwithout endorsing a position. See, e.g., 16A Charles Alan Wright\r\net al., Federal Practice & Procedure § 3953 (4th ed. 2008).\r\n\r\n                                      -28-\r\n\fof a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in\r\n\r\nany appropriate United States district court and shall recover\r\n\r\nthreefold the damages he sustains and the cost of the suit,\r\n\r\nincluding a reasonable attorney's fee\" (emphasis added). 18 U.S.C.\r\n\r\n§ 1964(c).    We assume for present purposes that appellate fees are\r\n\r\npart of the fees calculable as costs under RICO; Dziemit does not\r\n\r\nargue that this is not so, thereby waiving the argument, neither\r\n\r\nparty has briefed the issue, and we have found no authority to\r\n\r\ncounter our assumption. IFC proved below a RICO injury and defends\r\n\r\nthe finding on appeal.      We therefore see no reason why Dziemit's\r\n\r\nappeal bond may not include IFC's anticipated appellate fees.\r\n\r\n             Dziemit   argues   that    to    allow   for   the   inclusion   of\r\n\r\nattorneys' fees in appeal bonds will chill unsuccessful litigants\r\n\r\nfrom pursuing their right to appeal district court decisions. This\r\n\r\nreasoning is unpersuasive.        Any bond imposed pursuant to Rule 7\r\n\r\nburdens an appeal to some degree, yet we presume that Rule 7 is\r\n\r\nvalid.   See Adsani, 139 F.3d at 76.          To the extent that a bond may\r\n\r\nimpermissibly burden an appeal, a litigant can move us to stay the\r\n\r\nbond or to reduce its amount.                 Here, we are satisfied that\r\n\r\nDziemit's rights were not hampered.           Although she submitted in her\r\n\r\nmotion to stay the bond that she was in poor financial shape, we\r\n\r\nfound that she did not demonstrate any prospect of irreparable harm\r\n\r\nand she vowed to post the bond were her motion denied, which she\r\n\r\ndid.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       -29-\r\n\f                         III. Conclusion\r\n\r\n          For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the district\r\n\r\ncourt's judgment based on the jury verdict entered against Dziemit,\r\n\r\ndismiss IFC's cross-appeal related to its Chapter 93A claim, and\r\n\r\naffirm the district court's order imposing an appeal bond in the\r\n\r\namount of $10,000.\r\n\r\n          Costs are awarded to IFC.   We remand this matter to the\r\n\r\ndistrict court for a determination as to the awarding of appellate\r\n\r\nattorneys' fees.\r\n\r\n          So ordered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               -30-\r\n\f",

By   mid-2008,   only   two\r\n\r\ndefendants remained in the suit — David Adams, a former employee of\r\n\r\nIFC, and Jane Dziemit, an outside business woman.         After a joint\r\n\r\nfive-day trial, the jury returned a verdict against both Adams and\r\n\r\nDziemit.\r\n\r\n             There are three appellate issues before the court, which\r\n\r\ninvolve only Dziemit and IFC.1       Dziemit argues that the denial of\r\n\r\nher motion for judgment as a matter of law was in error and that\r\n\r\nthe district court's jury instruction on common law fraud was\r\n\r\nincorrect.     IFC cross-appeals with respect to one state law claim\r\n\r\nit brought under the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act, Mass.\r\n\r\nGen. Laws ch. 93A (\"Chapter 93A\"), on which the district court\r\n\r\nrefused to enter judgment.       Lastly, Dziemit separately appeals the\r\n\r\ndistrict court's imposition of an appeal bond for $10,000. For the\r\n\r\nfollowing reasons, we affirm the district court's judgment against\r\n\r\nDziemit and its imposition of the bond, and, at IFC's request, we\r\n\r\ndecline to rule on the Chapter 93A claim.\r\n\r\n\r\n     1\r\n         Adams did not appeal the jury verdict.\r\n\r\n                                    -2-\r\n\f                              I. Background\r\n\r\n           We recite the facts in the light most favorable to the\r\n\r\njury verdict.    Anaya-Burgos v.

Building 19, Inc. (\"Building 19\") is a\r\n\r\ncompany that operates fourteen retail discount stores throughout\r\n\r\nthe New England area selling a wide variety of consumer products.\r\n\r\nIFC   manages   the   rug   department   of   Building   19,   and   it    is\r\n\r\nresponsible for supplying Building 19's flooring inventory, which\r\n\r\nconsists mostly of surplus and salvage oriental rugs, indoor and\r\n\r\noutdoor rugs, remnants, padding, and wood flooring.\r\n\r\n           Because the scheme at issue involved the exploitation of\r\n\r\nIFC's business practices, we summarize briefly IFC's procedures for\r\n\r\nbuying and selling rugs.        Typically, IFC buyers negotiate with\r\n\r\noutside vendors to purchase merchandise for retail sale.              Upon\r\n\r\nplacing an order with a vendor, the IFC buyer creates a purchase\r\n\r\norder detailing the product bought, the price of the product, and\r\n\r\nthe outside vendor's information.        The buyer then provides copies\r\n\r\nof this purchase order to the vendor, an IFC warehouse, and IFC's\r\n\r\naccounts payable department.\r\n\r\n           After receiving a copy of the purchase order, the vendor\r\n\r\nsends IFC an invoice and delivers the goods to the IFC warehouse.\r\n\r\nAn IFC receiver accepts the product, and a supervisor at the\r\n\r\nwarehouse completes a receiving document termed a \"key-rec.\"              The\r\n\r\nkey-rec details the merchandise received, and the supervisor is\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   -2-\r\n\frequired to initial the document after having verified the contents\r\n\r\nof the delivery.     Once the key-rec is complete, it is sent to IFC's\r\n\r\naccounts payable department.           The accounts payable department\r\n\r\ncross-checks the corresponding purchase order, invoice, and key-\r\n\r\nrec.       If personnel see no discrepancies in the paperwork, an\r\n\r\naccounts payable manager issues payment to the vendor.\r\n\r\nA.   The Scheme\r\n\r\n             Starting sometime in the mid-1990s and lasting until\r\n\r\nApril 2005, Adams and co-conspirator Kevin Britto devised and\r\n\r\nmanaged a fraudulent scheme that duped IFC into paying out millions\r\n\r\nof dollars to various vendors based on fabricated invoices. As IFC\r\n\r\nbuyers,2 Adams and Britto prepared purchase orders for partially or\r\n\r\ncompletely fake merchandise shipments, recording on the orders an\r\n\r\nexaggerated amount of items purchased.        Britto communicated these\r\n\r\nfake purchases to Tyrone Williams, another IFC employee and the\r\n\r\nsupervisor     of   IFC's   largest   warehouse.    Williams,   in   turn,\r\n\r\ncompleted fraudulent key-recs to match the fraudulent purchase\r\n\r\norders.\r\n\r\n             Various outside vendors were brought into the scheme, and\r\n\r\nsome of these vendors were sham operations.        These outside vendors\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       2\r\n      Britto worked for IFC from July 1988 to November 1997, and\r\nagain from September 1998 to September 2001.      He continued to\r\nreceive money from the scheme even after he left IFC. Adams was\r\ninitially an outside vendor who did business with IFC, but IFC\r\nlater hired him as a buyer. Adams was terminated from IFC sometime\r\nin 2005, which precipitated the discovery of the fraud.\r\n\r\n                                      -3-\r\n\fwould send invoices to IFC that matched the phony purchase orders\r\n\r\nand key-recs, allowing the scheme to continue undetected by the\r\n\r\naccounts payable department.    Adams directed the vendors to charge\r\n\r\na specific amount on its invoices, and when IFC's accounts payable\r\n\r\ndepartment issued a check based on that amount, the vendors would\r\n\r\ndistribute approximately seventy-five percent of the ill-gotten\r\n\r\ngains to Adams, keeping the remainder for themselves.\r\n\r\n            Chinese Carpet Center, Inc. (\"CCC\") was the primary\r\n\r\nvendor that colluded with Adams and Britto.        David Sun, CCC's\r\n\r\nformer treasurer, testified at trial about the company's knowing\r\n\r\nparticipation, and he detailed the scheme's inner-workings.       He\r\n\r\nexplained that CCC was consistently required to advance to Adams\r\n\r\nlarge sums of money via cash, check, and wire transfers.    In turn,\r\n\r\nCCC would bill IFC for short or nonexistent shipments.      When CCC\r\n\r\nreceived payment from IFC, it was paid back the initially loaned\r\n\r\namount along with a profit, which was shared between CCC and Adams.\r\n\r\nSun explained that this loan system kept CCC in the scheme and made\r\n\r\nit difficult to disengage, lest CCC not recoup the money it had\r\n\r\nadvanced.\r\n\r\nB.   Dziemit's Role and the Evidence Against Her\r\n\r\n            Prior to her involvement in the scheme, Dziemit worked as\r\n\r\na mortgage lender associated with various companies, many of which\r\n\r\nwere owned and operated by her boyfriend, Tony Maresca.    Dziemit's\r\n\r\nprimary activity was the completion of loan paperwork for the\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 -4-\r\n\fcompanies, and she worked out of her home in Connecticut.                       At\r\n\r\ntimes, Dziemit would also make loans to third parties, drawing upon\r\n\r\nMaresca's mortgage companies or her own personal accounts to supply\r\n\r\nthe funds.         Each time Dziemit completed a loan, she executed a\r\n\r\nmortgage and a promissory note, and she profited from the loan\r\n\r\nbased on the interest that it accrued.\r\n\r\n               Maresca      was   a   long-time   friend   of   Ronald    Mitchell.\r\n\r\nMitchell owned and operated a carpet underlay supply business known\r\n\r\nas Remco, and later, as Mansfield Rug, which sold padding.                  At some\r\n\r\npoint in his career, Mitchell, doing business as Remco, sold\r\n\r\npadding to retail operations that he obtained from legitimate\r\n\r\nbusinesses.        His company had no employees other than himself.             In\r\n\r\n1999 or 2000, Dziemit began working with Mitchell as part of\r\n\r\nRemco,3 and she became a partner of the company for a few years.\r\n\r\nAround this time, Dziemit and Mitchell, along with Maresca, met\r\n\r\nwith       Adams   at   a   Building     19   store   to   initiate   a   business\r\n\r\nrelationship.\r\n\r\n               Mitchell and Dziemit testified at trial about their\r\n\r\ndealings with Adams and the transactions that were involved.\r\n\r\nAccording to their testimony, Adams would communicate to Mitchell\r\n\r\na specific amount of money that Mitchell, d/b/a Remco, was to lend\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       3\r\n      Evidence at trial also demonstrated that Dziemit was involved\r\nwith Mansfield Rug, a successor in name to Remco, to the extent\r\nthat she received at least two checks from the Mansfield Rug bank\r\naccount.\r\n\r\n                                          -5-\r\n\fto Adams, purportedly so that Adams could purchase rugs.      Then,\r\n\r\nAdams would send Mitchell an IFC purchase order that included a\r\n\r\ndescription of product ostensibly being supplied by Remco and the\r\n\r\namount that Remco was to charge IFC on an eventual invoice.      The\r\n\r\ninvoice amount was always greater than the loan amount, and the two\r\n\r\nfigures in no way corresponded.        Mitchell would then fax the\r\n\r\npurchase order to Dziemit and communicate to her the amount of the\r\n\r\nloan to Adams.\r\n\r\n          Dziemit, acting in her lending capacity, would lend to\r\n\r\nMitchell the money to be advanced to Adams.     Except for the first\r\n\r\nloan executed, Dziemit did not secure any notes or mortgages\r\n\r\nevidencing or securing these loans.4       Then, switching hats and\r\n\r\nacting as a Remco partner, Dziemit would advance the money to\r\n\r\nAdams, or at times, to Britto.         Many of these advances were\r\n\r\ncompleted via wire transfers.         Although Mitchell and Dziemit\r\n\r\nclaimed that Adams used this advanced money to buy the merchandise\r\n\r\nthat was listed on the purchase order and that was ostensibly being\r\n\r\nsupplied by Remco, neither of them ever saw any product that was\r\n\r\nbought or shipped, and they never sought to visit a warehouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     4\r\n      At one point in January 2001, Mitchell, not Dziemit, obtained\r\na mortgage on Adams' property.        Dziemit claimed to have an\r\nassignment on the mortgage, but she never produced this during\r\ndiscovery or at trial. Even if Dziemit had a mortgage on Adams'\r\nproperty, she did not have one on Mitchell's property, even though\r\nthe money she lent went to Mitchell, doing business as Remco.\r\n\r\n                                -6-\r\n\fBeyond the purchase order, there was no documentation that the\r\n\r\nproduct existed.\r\n\r\n             Approximately two or three weeks after Dziemit advanced\r\n\r\nmoney to Adams, Adams would alert Remco to submit an invoice to\r\n\r\nIFC.    Dziemit drafted the bulk of the invoices and either she or\r\n\r\nMitchell would mail them.            Upon receipt of the invoice, IFC would\r\n\r\nsend a check to Dziemit's post office box, or, at least one time,\r\n\r\ndirectly to Dziemit's home.              Dziemit would endorse the check from\r\n\r\nIFC and deposit it into the account from which she initially\r\n\r\nborrowed the funds, which could have been her personal account or\r\n\r\nthe account of one of Maresca's companies; Dziemit did not keep\r\n\r\ngood    records,   and    many      of   the   transactions         were   recorded   as\r\n\r\nhandwritten notations on various papers.                   Dziemit would then send\r\n\r\nAdams    a   portion   of     the   profit       and    share     the   remainder   with\r\n\r\nMitchell.     At no time throughout her involvement was Dziemit ever\r\n\r\nactually     engaged     in   the    sale      of      padding,    Remco's   purported\r\n\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n             When Dziemit testified at trial, she walked the jury\r\n\r\nthrough a sample transaction, using a $25,000 loan she made to\r\n\r\nMitchell and then advanced to Adams on November 18, 1999.                             On\r\n\r\nJanuary 19, 2000, approximately two months later, Dziemit received\r\n\r\nan invoice payment from IFC for $41,550.04.                       She deposited that\r\n\r\namount into one of her mortgage accounts, wired just over $10,000\r\n\r\nto Adams as his share of the profit, and split the remainder of the\r\n\r\n\r\n                                           -7-\r\n\fgains with Mitchell.    Dziemit personally profited $2915.28 from\r\n\r\nthis loan.   She agreed that this transaction indicated what would\r\n\r\nhave been a 66 percent interest rate on an annual basis for the\r\n\r\n$25,000 loan, much more than what she would have earned on a\r\n\r\ntypical secured mortgage loan.5\r\n\r\n          Sometime in late 2001, Dziemit ceased being a partner in\r\n\r\nRemco.   She did, however, continue to loan funds to Mitchell, and\r\n\r\nthese loans, along with a profit, were repaid to her.      She also\r\n\r\nreceived money both during the time she was a partner and later,\r\n\r\nthrough 2003, even when she did not advance any funds.    In total,\r\n\r\nDziemit completed approximately 35 transactions for Remco, and each\r\n\r\ntransaction took less than an hour.     She estimated that for these\r\n\r\n35 hours of work, she made approximately $130,000.\r\n\r\n          Dziemit admitted at trial that these transactions were a\r\n\r\ndeparture from her normal course of business.     Dziemit had never\r\n\r\nbefore lent money to one of her business partners, nor had she ever\r\n\r\nlent money without receiving security.    Dziemit estimated that she\r\n\r\nadvanced a total of approximately $1.4 million to Mitchell for the\r\n\r\ntransactions.    Apparently, of the total amount lent, she had\r\n\r\nsecurity for only $40,000.   Further, never before in her business\r\n\r\ndid Dziemit earn money from a loan based on a profit, rather than\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     5\r\n      As explained to the jury, Dziemit's payment represented\r\napproximately 11 percent of the loaned $25,000, which, extrapolated\r\nto a yearly rate, demonstrated that Dziemit would have made 66\r\npercent on the loan.\r\n\r\n                                  -8-\r\n\fon the accrued interest.        Indeed, in all of her previous lending\r\n\r\nactivities, Dziemit knew the percentage she would earn on a loan,\r\n\r\nbut with respect to the loans to Mitchell, she did not know how\r\n\r\nmuch she would earn on a particular loan at the time she made the\r\n\r\nadvance.       Additionally, there was no relationship between the\r\n\r\namount Dziemit advanced and the ultimate profit that she earned.\r\n\r\nC.    The Discovery of the Fraud and the Subsequent Suit\r\n\r\n              In March 2005, IFC terminated Adams for poor performance.\r\n\r\nThe   buyer     hired   to   replace    Adams    began    to     notice   various\r\n\r\ndiscrepancies     between    purchases       Adams   allegedly    made    and   the\r\n\r\nproduct available for retail sale.            After delving through records,\r\n\r\nthe new buyer contacted Mitchell about several missing deliveries\r\n\r\nostensibly from Mansfield Rug.         Mitchell, trying to stave off any\r\n\r\ninquiries into the transactions, forwarded a fake bill of lading\r\n\r\nthat he created with the help of Britto.             He also misled the buyer\r\n\r\ninto believing that he had a warehouse full of goods and that other\r\n\r\ndocuments related to any deliveries were destroyed and therefore\r\n\r\nunavailable for verification.           Around this time, IFC's accounts\r\n\r\npayable    department    performed     an    internal    investigation,     which\r\n\r\nultimately uncovered the scheme. The department determined that it\r\n\r\nhad paid almost $10 million in fraudulent invoices from Remco,\r\n\r\nMansfield Rug, and CCC.\r\n\r\n              On August 10, 2005, IFC brought suit against Adams,\r\n\r\nBritto, Williams, CCC and its officers, Mitchell, and Dziemit,\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       -9-\r\n\famong many others, for violations of RICO and Massachusetts state\r\n\r\nlaw.    In 2006, it settled with CCC and its officers and employees.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, it filed a suggestion of apparent death as to Britto, who\r\n\r\nhad been suffering from a grave liver disease.    Prior to Britto's\r\n\r\ndeath, IFC videotaped his deposition, wherein Britto confessed to\r\n\r\nthe scheme, implicated Adams and Williams, and denied the knowing\r\n\r\ninvolvement of Dziemit and Mitchell.     In 2008, an agreement for\r\n\r\njudgment was entered against Mitchell for over $3 million, and\r\n\r\ndefault judgment was entered against Williams.    By July 21, 2008,\r\n\r\nonly Dziemit and Adams remained to stand trial for the following\r\n\r\nclaims: (1) violations of RICO; (2) conspiracy to violate RICO;\r\n\r\n(3) common law fraud; and (4) as to Adams only, breach of fiduciary\r\n\r\nduty.    The district court reserved for itself IFC's Chapter 93A\r\n\r\nclaim against Dziemit and Adams.\r\n\r\n            On July 29, 2009, the district court charged the jury,\r\n\r\nand the following day, the jury returned its verdict.      It found\r\n\r\nboth Adams and Dziemit liable to IFC for violations of RICO and\r\n\r\ncommon law fraud.   It further found Adams, but not Dziemit, to have\r\n\r\nengaged in conspiracy to violate RICO, and it found Adams liable\r\n\r\nfor breach of fiduciary duty.    The jury awarded IFC $5 million in\r\n\r\ndamages against Adams, and $250,000 against Dziemit.    Pursuant to\r\n\r\nthe RICO statute, the district court trebled these damages and\r\n\r\nawarded IFC $522,281 in costs, including attorneys' fees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 -10-\r\n\f              A flurry of post-trial motions ensued, only some of which\r\n\r\nare relevant for present purposes. IFC moved for entry of judgment\r\n\r\nagainst Adams and Dziemit on the Chapter 93A count.           The district\r\n\r\ncourt denied the motion in an electronic order issued that same\r\n\r\nday, stating, \"Because full damages were determined by the jury and\r\n\r\ntrebled by the Court pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), the Chapter\r\n\r\n93A claim is rendered duplicative and redundant and plaintiff's\r\n\r\nmotion is denied.\"       IFC sought reconsideration, which the district\r\n\r\ncourt also denied.\r\n\r\n              Thereafter, Dziemit renewed her motion for judgment as a\r\n\r\nmatter of law, for which she initially moved at the close of IFC's\r\n\r\ncase-in-chief and at the close of trial, arguing that there was\r\n\r\ninsufficient evidence to find that she knowingly and willfully\r\n\r\nengaged in any fraud, or was willfully blind to the scheme.               The\r\n\r\ndistrict court denied this motion as well.\r\n\r\n              In her subsequent appeal, Dziemit now argues that IFC\r\n\r\nfailed   to    present   sufficient    evidence   to   establish   that   she\r\n\r\nknowingly and willfully committed two or more acts of mail and/or\r\n\r\nwire fraud, rendering the RICO and common law fraud verdicts void.\r\n\r\nShe also argues that the district court erred in providing the jury\r\n\r\nwith a \"willful blindness\" instruction as to the common law fraud\r\n\r\nclaim, and, to the extent that the instruction was proper, there\r\n\r\nwas still insufficient evidence to prove that she was willfully\r\n\r\nblind.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      -11-\r\n\f           IFC cross-appealed. It argues that although the district\r\n\r\ncourt was correct to reserve the Chapter 93A claim for itself, the\r\n\r\ncourt erroneously denied IFC's motion for judgment on the claim\r\n\r\nbecause IFC presented sufficient evidence to support it.\r\n\r\n           Lastly, Dziemit appeals the district court's order that\r\n\r\nshe post an appeal bond that includes attorneys' fees as \"costs on\r\n\r\nappeal.\"   IFC sought a bond pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate\r\n\r\nProcedure 7, after Dziemit filed her notice of appeal, to ensure\r\n\r\npayment of its appellate costs, including attorneys' fees.      The\r\n\r\ndistrict court granted IFC's motion and required Dziemit to post a\r\n\r\nbond for $10,000, of which $5000 was meant to cover appellate fees.\r\n\r\n           Because we find that IFC presented sufficient evidence to\r\n\r\nsupport the jury's verdict that Dziemit violated RICO and committed\r\n\r\ncommon law fraud, and because we find no plain error in the\r\n\r\ndistrict court's jury instructions, we affirm the judgment against\r\n\r\nDziemit.    Because we affirm the judgment against Dziemit, we\r\n\r\ndecline to rule on IFC's Chapter 93A claim at IFC's request.\r\n\r\nLastly, we affirm the issuance of the appeal bond and hold that an\r\n\r\nappeal bond may include appellate attorneys' fees if the applicable\r\n\r\nstatute underlying the litigation contains a fee-shifting provision\r\n\r\nthat accounts for such fees in its definition of recoverable costs\r\n\r\nand the appellee is eligible to recover them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                -12-\r\n\f                                   II. Analysis\r\n\r\nA.

She argues only that IFC failed\r\n\r\nto prove that she knowingly and willfully committed mail or wire\r\n\r\nfraud, asserting that she was a peripheral participant and unaware\r\n\r\nof her complicity.      She states that the lack of direct evidence\r\n\r\nattesting   to   her   knowledge   coupled    with   her   own   exculpatory\r\n\r\ntestimony and that of Britto demonstrates that a reasonable juror\r\n\r\ncould not have found her liable under RICO.\r\n\r\n            We reject Dziemit's contention. A review of the evidence\r\n\r\nin the light most favorable to IFC demonstrates that IFC presented\r\n\r\nsufficient evidence for a jury to conclude by a preponderance of\r\n\r\nthe evidence that Dziemit knowingly and willfully participated in\r\n\r\ndefrauding IFC.    First, the jury heard testimony from Mitchell and\r\n\r\nDavid Sun from which it could infer Dziemit's knowledge. Mitchell,\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   -14-\r\n\fDziemit's partner, admitted that he agreed to a judgment against\r\n\r\nhimself and that he lied to IFC in an attempt to stave off\r\n\r\ninquiries into his companies' dealings.                  David Sun admitted to\r\n\r\nCCC's complicity and described in terms strikingly similar to\r\n\r\nDziemit that it was required to advance large sums of money to\r\n\r\nAdams via wire transfers and checks, and that it would make a\r\n\r\nprofit on these advances once IFC paid its invoices.\r\n\r\n            Second,    the   evidence     demonstrated       that    Dziemit      was\r\n\r\ninvolved from the start in the transactions between Remco and\r\n\r\nAdams.   Dziemit, along with Mitchell and Maresca, met Adams at a\r\n\r\nBuilding 19 store to initiate their dealings, and she continued to\r\n\r\nconduct transactions with Adams for approximately three years.\r\n\r\n            Third,    Dziemit,   a   Remco    partner      purportedly       in   the\r\n\r\nbusiness of selling rug padding, advanced large sums of money to\r\n\r\nAdams, a buyer of rug products. Further, she acknowledged that she\r\n\r\nnever saw a Remco warehouse or any product it allegedly sold.\r\n\r\nAlthough she drafted and sent invoices to IFC, she never had any\r\n\r\nverification,   apart    from    Adams'     word    as   told   to    her   through\r\n\r\nMitchell, that any rugs were being delivered to IFC.\r\n\r\n            Fourth, and perhaps most significant, Dziemit admitted to\r\n\r\nthe unusual nature of her profits and her dealings with Adams and\r\n\r\nMitchell.     Dziemit    advanced    money     to    Mitchell,       her    business\r\n\r\npartner, and then, in turn, advanced that money to Adams, the\r\n\r\nostensible buyer, often through wire transfers or checks. She lent\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     -15-\r\n\fthis money from and deposited money back into various accounts,\r\n\r\nincluding    both     business       and    personal      accounts,    and    she   kept\r\n\r\nhaphazard records.        Dziemit advanced a total of approximately $1.4\r\n\r\nmillion to Mitchell but had only $40,000 secured. She earned money\r\n\r\nnot from the interest rate of the loans she provided, but from a\r\n\r\nprofit realized upon charging IFC an amount that had no relation to\r\n\r\nthe   initial    loan.        Were    these      profits    interpreted      as   earned\r\n\r\ninterest, they would be considerably higher than any typical\r\n\r\ninterest rate earned on a mortgage.                  In total, Dziemit was paid\r\n\r\n$130,000 for approximately 35 hours of work, less than a typical\r\n\r\nworkweek.       She was compensated even when she was no longer a\r\n\r\npartner and even when she did not advance any money.\r\n\r\n            This      evidence,      when     viewed      in   the    aggregate,    was\r\n\r\nsufficient      for     the   jury    to    conclude       that   Dziemit     knowingly\r\n\r\ncommitted two or more acts of mail or wire fraud.

In turn, Dziemit\r\n\r\nasserts on appeal that IFC's evidence was inadequate to sustain its\r\n\r\nfraud claim for the same reasons she stated in challenging the RICO\r\n\r\njudgment,    that   is,   that   the   evidence   against    her   did   not\r\n\r\ndemonstrate that she actually knew that the invoices she sent to\r\n\r\nIFC were fraudulent.      Further, she claims that, to the extent that\r\n\r\nthe court properly instructed the jury that knowledge as to common\r\n\r\nlaw fraud could be proved by willful blindness (which she contests\r\n\r\non appeal), the evidence did not indicate that she was willfully\r\n\r\nblind to her fraud since not even IFC was able to discover the\r\n\r\nscheme until almost ten years after it began.\r\n\r\n            Dziemit's challenge to the fraud claim unravels in view\r\n\r\nof our conclusion that the evidence at trial reasonably supported\r\n\r\na finding of RICO liability.      As we explained in our determination\r\n\r\nof Dziemit's RICO argument, a jury could have reasonably inferred\r\n\r\nfrom the circumstantial evidence that Dziemit actually knew that\r\n\r\nthe invoices she mailed to IFC were fraudulent.              This alone is\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   -19-\r\n\fsufficient to sustain the fraud claim, as the jury needed to find\r\n\r\nonly actual knowledge or willful blindness to deem Dziemit liable\r\n\r\nfor fraud.\r\n\r\n          3. Willful Blindness Instruction\r\n\r\n          Dziemit claims that the district court erred in supplying\r\n\r\nthe jury with a willful blindness instruction for the common law\r\n\r\nfraud claim.6   She argues, first, and with no citation to case law,\r\n\r\nthat the instruction is improper in the civil context and instead\r\n\r\nis reserved solely for criminal matters.        Second, parroting her\r\n\r\nsufficiency of the evidence argument, she contends that even if the\r\n\r\ninstruction was not in error as a matter of law, it was improper in\r\n\r\nthis case because there was not \"'record evidence reveal[ing]\r\n\r\n'flags'   of    suspicion   that,    uninvestigated,   suggest   willful\r\n\r\nblindness.'\"    See United States v.

She is wrong. The\r\nrecord demonstrates unambiguously that she did not object to this\r\ninstruction at the charge conference or at any time after the\r\ninstruction was given to the jury. Indeed, the only issue as to\r\nthe willful blindness instruction arose from whether it could be\r\nused to support liability under RICO, for which IFC advocated and\r\nwhich the district court rejected (an issue not raised on appeal).\r\nIndeed, Dziemit's trial counsel stated that he did not believe the\r\ninstruction was proper for the RICO claim, but that it was\r\nappropriate for the common law fraud count because for \"fraud --\r\nthere is language in cases, I think, that allows a lower standard,\r\nif you will, which is this willful blindness, where you may know\r\nsomething but you basically take the position, I don't want to know\r\nwhat it is that's going on.\"\r\n     8\r\n      We note, however, that Massachusetts appears to support a\r\nwillful blindness instruction in civil fraud suits.           The\r\nMassachusetts Superior Court Civil Practice Jury Instructions for\r\nintentional misrepresentation read:\r\n\r\n          The defendant is liable if [he/she] made a\r\n          false statement of fact, knowing it to be\r\n          false.   Likewise, if the defendant made an\r\n          unqualified statement about facts, the truth\r\n          or falsity of which the defendant could have\r\n          determined with certainty, and gave the\r\n          plaintiff the reasonable impression that\r\n          [he/she] was speaking of [his/her] own\r\n          knowledge, then the defendant is not excused\r\n          from liability if [he/she] did not in fact\r\n          know whether that statement was true or false.\r\n          The law regards such willful disregard of the\r\n          facts   as  equivalent   to   an   intentional\r\n          misrepresentation. Actual intent to deceive\r\n          need not be proven.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               -21-\r\n\fdetermination that Dziemit was liable for violating RICO, it found\r\n\r\nthat Dziemit actually knew that she engaged in mail and/or wire\r\n\r\nfraud.    The jury, then, did not need to rely on the willful\r\n\r\nblindness instruction to reach its verdict on the fraud claim; its\r\n\r\nfinding of liability would have been the same even without the\r\n\r\ninstruction.\r\n\r\nB.   IFC's Cross-Appeal in Relation to its Chapter 93A Claim\r\n\r\n           On its cross-appeal, IFC argues that the district court\r\n\r\nerred in denying its motion for entry of judgment against Dziemit\r\n\r\non its Chapter 93A claim.    It seeks a remand to the district court\r\n\r\nto make findings, or a ruling from this court on the merits.\r\n\r\n           During oral argument, this court asked counsel for IFC\r\n\r\nwhether it wished to pursue its Chapter 93A claim in the event that\r\n\r\nthe court upheld the jury verdict against Dziemit.                Although\r\n\r\ncounsel indicated during argument that it would still seek the\r\n\r\nclaim's   resolution,   it   reversed   its   position   in   a     letter\r\n\r\nsubsequently mailed to the court. In view of IFC's stance, because\r\n\r\nwe affirm the judgment against Dziemit based on the jury verdict,\r\n\r\nwe decline to address its Chapter 93A claim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMass. Super. Ct.

Dziemit's Appeal in Relation to the Appeal Bond\r\n\r\n           Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 7 states, \"In a civil\r\n\r\ncase, the district court may require an appellant to file a bond or\r\n\r\nprovide other security in any form and amount necessary to ensure\r\n\r\npayment of costs on appeal.\"    Fed. R. App. P. 7.      IFC moved in the\r\n\r\ndistrict court for such a bond after Dziemit filed her notice of\r\n\r\nappeal, asking that Dziemit be required to post $30,000 to cover\r\n\r\n$5000 of IFC's anticipated expenses and $25,000 of its appellate\r\n\r\nattorneys' fees.   IFC argued that the inclusion of attorneys' fees\r\n\r\nin a Rule 7 bond is proper when           the statute underlying the\r\n\r\nlitigation   contains   a   fee-shifting    provision    that   includes\r\n\r\nattorneys' fees as part of costs awardable, as RICO does.            The\r\n\r\ndistrict court granted IFC's motion and ordered Dziemit to post an\r\n\r\nappeal bond of $10,000 within fifteen days.       In doing so, it did\r\n\r\nnot adopt IFC's reasoning and instead held that because Dziemit's\r\n\r\nappeal bore \"the indicia of frivolousness,\" the bond could include\r\n\r\nfees as part of the costs on appeal.\r\n\r\n           Dziemit appealed the district court order and did not\r\n\r\npost the bond by the deadline.          Thereafter, the parties filed\r\n\r\nseveral motions, both in district court and in this court, related\r\n\r\nto the bond.    Dziemit sought to stay the bond, IFC sought to\r\n\r\ndismiss Dziemit's appeals for her failure to post the bond, IFC\r\n\r\nsought to stay the merits appeals pending resolution of the bond\r\n\r\nappeal, and IFC moved for a briefing extension in view of the\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 -23-\r\n\fappeal bond issue.     This court issued an order on November 17,\r\n\r\n2009, denying Dziemit's motion to stay the bond and IFC's motions\r\n\r\nto stay or dismiss the appeals.             We granted IFC's motion for a\r\n\r\nbriefing extension and directed the parties to address the circuit\r\n\r\nsplit concerning the inclusion of attorneys' fees in an appeal\r\n\r\nbond.\r\n\r\n           We review for abuse of discretion a district court's\r\n\r\nimposition of an appeal bond, including its view that an appeal is\r\n\r\nfrivolous.

First,\r\n\r\nRule 7 does not define the term \"costs on appeal.\"           Although the\r\n\r\nAmerican rule establishes that each party to a litigation is\r\n\r\nresponsible for paying its own attorneys' fees, several statutes\r\n\r\nenacted prior to both the 1968 adoption of the Federal Rules of\r\n\r\nAppellate Procedure and the 1979 amendment to Rule 7 contain\r\n\r\nexceptions to the American rule and define costs recoverable to\r\n\r\ninclude fees.9    See Marek v.

An amendment in 1979\r\neliminated the requirement and left the bond issuance and amount to\r\nthe discretion of the district court.      See Fed. R.

It is presumed that the Rule drafters\r\n\r\nwere aware of these statutes and understood \"costs\" under Rule 7 to\r\n\r\nprovide for these fees when applicable.              See Adsani, 139 F.3d at\r\n\r\n73; see also Marek, 473 U.S. at 8-9.\r\n\r\n             Supreme Court precedent supports this view.         In Marek v.\r\n\r\nChesney, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111495\"><a href=\"/opinion/111495/marek-v-chesny/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the Court interpreted \"costs\" as stated in\r\n\r\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 6810 to encompass attorneys' fees\r\n\r\nwhen a fee-shifting statute included the fees as part of the\r\n\r\nrecoverable costs.       It explained:\r\n\r\n             [G]iven the importance of \"costs\" to the Rule,\r\n             it is very unlikely that this omission [of a\r\n             definition of \"costs\"] was mere oversight; on\r\n             the contrary, the most reasonable inference is\r\n             that the term \"costs\" in Rule 68 was intended\r\n             to refer to all costs properly awardable under\r\n             the relevant substantive statute or other\r\n             authority.\r\n\r\nId.    at 9.\r\n\r\n             Second,     our   holding   is   not     contrary   to    Federal\r\n\r\nRule    of   Appellate    Procedure   39.     Rule    39,   entitled   \"Costs\"\r\n\r\nestablishes: (a) against whom costs may be assessed, (b) the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       10\r\n      Rule 68 controls offers of judgment.

R. Civ. P. 68(d)\r\n(2010).   In Marek, the Court found that these \"costs\" include\r\nattorneys' fees when the relevant statute underlying the litigation\r\ndefined awardable costs as both costs and fees. 473 U.S at 8-9.\r\n\r\n                                      -26-\r\n\fcircumstances under which costs may be assessed for or against the\r\n\r\nUnited States, (c) costs for brief and appendix copies, (d) the\r\n\r\nprocedure for claiming costs, and (e) costs on appeal that are\r\n\r\ntaxable in the district court.       Dziemit argues that the list of\r\n\r\ntaxable costs in subdivision (e), which does not include attorneys'\r\n\r\nfees,11 defines \"costs\" for Rule 7 purposes and limits the universe\r\n\r\nof costs that may be awarded on appeal.      We are unconvinced.    No\r\n\r\npart of Rule 39 purports to define costs; each concerns only the\r\n\r\nprocedures for taxing them.     Adsani, 139 F.3d at 74.   Further, the\r\n\r\nRule does not limit \"costs on appeal\" under Rule 7.       The advisory\r\n\r\ncommittee's note at the adoption of the Rules explains that \"[t]he\r\n\r\ncosts described in [Rule 39(e)] are costs of the appeal and, as\r\n\r\nsuch, are within the undertaking of the appeal bond.\"     Fed. R. App.\r\n\r\nP. 39(e) advisory committee's note (1967) (emphasis added).         We\r\n\r\nunderstand this to mean that the costs delineated in Rule 39(e)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     11\r\n          Rule 39(e) reads:\r\n\r\n             The following costs on appeal are taxable in\r\n             the district court for the benefit of the\r\n             party entitled to costs under this rule:\r\n\r\n             (1)   the preparation and transmission of the\r\n                   record;\r\n             (2)   the reporter's transcript, if needed to\r\n                   determine the appeal;\r\n             (3)   premiums paid for a supersedeas bond or\r\n                   other bond to preserve rights pending\r\n                   appeal; and\r\n             (4)   the fee for filing the notice of appeal.\r\n\r\n                                  -27-\r\n\f\"are among, but not necessarily the only, costs available on\r\n\r\nappeal\" or for a bond.

Moore,   et   al.,   Moore's   Federal\r\nPractice, § 339.41 (3d ed. 1997); 16A Charles Alan Wright & Arthur\r\nR. Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure § 3953 (2d ed. 1996)).\r\nMore recent editions, however, merely acknowledge the circuit split\r\nwithout endorsing a position. See, e.g., 16A Charles Alan Wright\r\net al., Federal Practice & Procedure § 3953 (4th ed. 2008).\r\n\r\n                                      -28-\r\n\fof a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in\r\n\r\nany appropriate United States district court and shall recover\r\n\r\nthreefold the damages he sustains and the cost of the suit,\r\n\r\nincluding a reasonable attorney's fee\" (emphasis added). 18 U.S.C.\r\n\r\n§ 1964(c).    We assume for present purposes that appellate fees are\r\n\r\npart of the fees calculable as costs under RICO; Dziemit does not\r\n\r\nargue that this is not so, thereby waiving the argument, neither\r\n\r\nparty has briefed the issue, and we have found no authority to\r\n\r\ncounter our assumption. IFC proved below a RICO injury and defends\r\n\r\nthe finding on appeal.      We therefore see no reason why Dziemit's\r\n\r\nappeal bond may not include IFC's anticipated appellate fees.\r\n\r\n             Dziemit   argues   that    to    allow   for   the   inclusion   of\r\n\r\nattorneys' fees in appeal bonds will chill unsuccessful litigants\r\n\r\nfrom pursuing their right to appeal district court decisions. This\r\n\r\nreasoning is unpersuasive.        Any bond imposed pursuant to Rule 7\r\n\r\nburdens an appeal to some degree, yet we presume that Rule 7 is\r\n\r\nvalid.   See Adsani, 139 F.3d at 76.          To the extent that a bond may\r\n\r\nimpermissibly burden an appeal, a litigant can move us to stay the\r\n\r\nbond or to reduce its amount.                 Here, we are satisfied that\r\n\r\nDziemit's rights were not hampered.           Although she submitted in her\r\n\r\nmotion to stay the bond that she was in poor financial shape, we\r\n\r\nfound that she did not demonstrate any prospect of irreparable harm\r\n\r\nand she vowed to post the bond were her motion denied, which she\r\n\r\ndid.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       -29-\r\n\f                         III. Conclusion\r\n\r\n          For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the district\r\n\r\ncourt's judgment based on the jury verdict entered against Dziemit,\r\n\r\ndismiss IFC's cross-appeal related to its Chapter 93A claim, and\r\n\r\naffirm the district court's order imposing an appeal bond in the\r\n\r\namount of $10,000.\r\n\r\n          Costs are awarded to IFC.   We remand this matter to the\r\n\r\ndistrict court for a determination as to the awarding of appellate\r\n\r\nattorneys' fees.\r\n\r\n          So ordered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               -30-\r\n\f</pre>",
