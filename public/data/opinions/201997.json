Rya W. Zobel, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                          Boudin, Chief Judge,\n               Campbell and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Edward Griffith, with whom Silvia Bolatti and Bolatti &\nGriffith were on brief for appellant.\n     James W. Nagle, with whom Leslie S. Blickenstaff and Goodwin\nProcter LLP were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           January 5, 2006\n\f          CAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judge.        Plaintiff-appellant\n\nRuben Carnero (\"Carnero\") appeals from judgments of the United\n\nStates District Court for the District of Massachusetts dismissing\n\nhis federal and state law complaints against Boston Scientific\n\nCorporation   (\"BSC\").   Both    complaints   alleged   that   BSC   had\n\nterminated him in retaliation for \"whistleblowing\" -- for telling\n\nBSC that Latin American subsidiaries had created false invoices and\n\nhad inflated sales figures.     The district court determined that\n\nCarnero, an Argentinian citizen resident in Brazil who worked for\n\nthe two BSC subsidiaries and whose whistleblowing pertained to\n\ntheir alleged improprieties in Latin America, could not sue BSC\n\nunder the whistleblower protection provision contained in Title\n\nVIII, Section 806, of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 18 U.S.C. §\n\n1514A (2005).   In the district court's view, that provision is\n\nwithout extraterritorial effect.    The court also held that Carnero\n\ncould not pursue state law claims against BSC as he \"had no contact\n\nwith the defendant in Massachusetts\" and as defendant did not \"in\n\nany way direct or control\" his employment.          For the reasons\n\ndiscussed below, we affirm.\n\n                          I.    Background\n\n          As said, Carnero is a citizen of Argentina and currently\n\nresides in Brazil.   The defendant, BSC, is a Delaware corporation\n\nwith headquarters in Natick, Massachusetts.         BSC manufactures\n\n\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fmedical equipment and has operations in many countries throughout\n\nthe world.\n\n           In 1997, Carnero, while residing in Argentina, accepted\n\nemployment with a BSC subsidiary in Argentina, Boston Scientific\n\nArgentina S.A. (\"BSA\"), an Argentinian company.        His employment\n\nagreement, entered into in Argentina although negotiated in various\n\ncountries including the United States, provided that his place of\n\nwork was BSA's headquarters (which is in Buenos Aires), that he\n\nwould be paid in pesos, and that the employment agreement was\n\ngoverned by the laws of Argentina.       Carnero initially worked for\n\nBSA as Country Manager for Argentina and then served as the Latin\n\nAmerica   Business   Development   Director.   In   2001,   he   took    an\n\nassignment as Country Manager for a Brazilian subsidiary of BSC,\n\nBoston Scientific Do Brasil Ltda. (\"BSB\"), while still employed by\n\nBSA.   Carnero asserts that he was terminated from BSB in August\n\n2002, and from BSA in April 2003, in retaliation for reporting to\n\nsupervisors at BSC that BSC's Argentinian and Brazilian companies,\n\nas well as other foreign companies, were engaged in accounting\n\nmisconduct by, inter alia, improperly inflating sales figures.\n\n           It is undisputed that Carnero was directly employed and\n\npaid by BSC's Argentinian and Brazilian subsidiaries rather than by\n\nBSC itself.    It is also undisputed that the alleged fraudulent\n\nconduct reported by Carnero was instituted in Latin America.            But\n\nCarnero also asserts he had an overarching employment relationship\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fwith the United States parent, BSC, resulting from the extensive\n\nand continuous control BSC's own Massachusetts employees allegedly\n\nexercised over his work and duties in Latin America.             He says that\n\nhe     maintained     contact   with    BSC,   traveling       frequently   to\n\nMassachusetts to meet with supervisors there.              Carnero does not\n\ndispute, however, that his employment duties were mainly performed\n\noutside of the United States, nor that his immediate employers were\n\nthe two foreign subsidiaries.\n\n            In      April   2003,   Carnero    pursued     a    \"conciliation\n\nproceeding\" in Argentina, a prerequisite to filing suit in an\n\nArgentinian court for statutory termination benefits from BSC and\n\nBSA.    Argentinian employees terminated without cause are entitled\n\nto such benefits. An Argentinian mediator held a hearing with BSC,\n\nBSA and Carnero, but a settlement could not be reached.               On June\n\n20, 2003, BSC and BSA brought their own claims in the Argentinian\n\ncourt, alleging, inter alia, defamation based on Carnero's claims\n\nof billing irregularities. On June 23, 2003, the Argentinian court\n\ndenied a preliminary injunction, finding that Carnero's claims of\n\n\"operating irregularities\" had not been shown to be false or\n\npublicized to third parties.        The Argentinian action appears to be\n\nongoing.\n\n            On July 2, 2003, Carnero filed a complaint against BSC\n\nwith the United States Department of Labor (\"DOL\") pursuant to the\n\nwhistleblower protection provision contained in Title VIII, Section\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f806, of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 18 U.S.C. § 1514A(b)(1)(A)\n\n(providing for filing of complaint with the United States Secretary\n\nof Labor).1   On August 8, 2003, Carnero filed a complaint against\n\nBSC in the United States District Court for the District of\n\nMassachusetts based on diversity of citizenship under 28 U.S.C. §\n\n1332(a)(2)    (1993    &     Supp.   2005),      asserting   state   law   claims,\n\nincluding breach of contract and retaliatory termination.\n\n            On December 19, 2003, the DOL issued a preliminary\n\ndecision dismissing Carnero's Sarbanes-Oxley whistleblower claim.\n\nThe   DOL   found     that    BSC    was    covered    by    the   Sarbanes-Oxley\n\nwhistleblower provision because it is a publicly traded company on\n\nthe New York Stock Exchange.               The DOL ruled, however, that the\n\nwhistleblower protection provision of the Act did not apply to\n\nemployees of covered companies working outside of the United\n\nStates.     Carnero v. Boston Scientific Corp., 2004-SOX-22 (OSHA\n\nReg'l Adm'r) (Dec. 19, 2003) (citing Foley Bros., Inc. v. Filardo,\n\n336 U.S. 281, 285 (1949) (noting that it is well settled that\n\n\"legislation of Congress, unless a contrary intent appears, is\n\n\n\n      1\n      The Secretary of Labor has delegated her responsibility for\nreceiving and investigating whistleblower complaints to the\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\"), an agency\nwithin the DOL. Secretary's Order 5-2002; Delegation of Authority\nand Assignment of Responsibility to the Assistant Secretary for\nOccupational Safety and Health, 67 Fed. Reg. 65008-01, 65008, 2002\nWL 31358967 (Oct. 22, 2002); see 29 C.F.R. § 1980.103(c) (2005).\nFor convenience, we will frequently refer to the Secretary and OSHA\nas the DOL.\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\fmeant to apply only within the territorial jurisdiction of the\n\nUnited States\")).      Carnero then filed a complaint in the United\n\nStates District Court for the District of Massachusetts on January\n\n7, 2004, seeking de novo judicial review of his Sarbanes-Oxley\n\nwhistleblower claim.         See 18 U.S.C. § 1514A(b)(1)(B) (providing\n\nthat claimant may bring federal court action if Secretary of Labor\n\nhas   not   issued   final    decision   within   180   days   of   filing   of\n\ncomplaint and there is no showing that delay is due to claimant's\n\nbad faith).2    Both of Carnero's district court complaints sought\n\nhis reinstatement, among other relief.\n\n            BSC moved to dismiss both complaints. On March 25, 2004,\n\nthe district court dismissed Carnero's state law claims, finding\n\nthat Carnero \"had no contact with the defendant in Massachusetts\"\n\nand that defendant did not \"in any way direct or control\" his\n\nemployment.    Carnero v. Boston Scientific Corp., No. 03-11479-RWZ\n\n(D. Mass.) (Mar. 25, 2004 endorsed order).          The court subsequently\n\ndenied both Carnero's motion for reconsideration pursuant to Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 59(e) and his motion to consolidate the state law action\n\nwith the federal law action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(a).               Id.\n\n(May 13, 2004 endorsed order).              On August 27, 2004, the court\n\ndismissed     Carnero's      claim   brought    under   the    whistleblower\n\n\n\n      2\n      Carnero also filed objections to the DOL's preliminary\nfindings. The DOL issued a final decision dismissing the complaint\nbecause of the pending court action.\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fprotection provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, after examining the\n\nlanguage and legislative history of the law.      Carnero v. Boston\n\nScientific Corp., No. 04-10031-RWZ, 2004 WL 1922132 (D. Mass. Aug.\n\n27, 2004) (citing Foley Bros., 336 U.S. at 285-86).        The court\n\nagreed with the DOL's preliminary determination that \"[n]othing in\n\nSection 1514A(a) remotely suggests that Congress intended it to\n\napply outside of the United States.\"    Id. at *2.   Carnero appeals\n\nfrom these rulings.\n\n                       II.   The Federal Claim\n\n          We turn first to the dismissal of Carnero's complaint\n\nbrought under the whistleblower protection statute, 18 U.S.C. §\n\n1514A, of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.   Insofar as we know, no court has\n\nyet determined if this provision protects foreign citizens working\n\noutside of the United States for foreign subsidiaries of covered\n\ncompanies.    The interpretation of a statute engenders our de novo\n\nreview. Bonano v. E. Caribbean Airline Corp., 365 F.3d 81, 83 (1st\n\nCir. 2004).\n\n          As noted, Carnero initially filed a complaint against BSC\n\n(the parent U.S. company) with the United States Department of\n\nLabor pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1514A(b)(1)(A).        The DOL, acting\n\nthrough its agency, OSHA, rejected this in a preliminary report, on\n\nthe ground that the whistleblower protection statute did not\n\nprotect employees of covered companies working outside of the\n\nUnited States.    Carnero v. Boston Scientific Corp., 2004-SOX-22\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f(OSHA Reg' Adm'r) (Dec. 19, 2003), supra.              No final agency report\n\nhaving issued within 180 days, Carnero brought a similar complaint\n\nagainst BSC in the United States District Court for the District of\n\nMassachusetts, seeking, under the provisions of the statute, de\n\nnovo judicial review of his whistleblower claim.                See 18 U.S.C. §\n\n1514A(b)(1)(B).       In its dismissal of that action, the district\n\ncourt echoed OSHA's prior view that the whistleblower protection\n\nprovision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act does not apply outside of the\n\nUnited States.     See supra.\n\n             A. Whether Carnero's Claim -- Apart from the Question of\n             Extraterritoriality -- Fits otherwise within the Terms of\n             the Whistleblower Protection Provision\n\n\n             Before     proceeding      to    ask     whether        the      instant\n\nwhistleblower protection provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was\n\nmeant   by   Congress    to   provide    extraterritorial           relief,    it   is\n\nsensible to ask whether Carnero's claim is of the kind that would,\n\nif arising domestically, fit within that provision's language.                      If\n\nnot, little need would exist to explore the extraterritorial issue.\n\nWe conclude as an initial matter, without deciding finally, that\n\nCarnero's     claim     would    --     putting       aside     the        issue    of\n\nextraterritoriality      --   fit    generally      within    the    whistleblower\n\nprotection provision of 18 U.S.C. § 1514A.\n\n             The whistleblower protection provision codified in 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1514A is a relatively small part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\n\nwhich is composed of many separate statutes and statutory schemes\n\n                                        -8-\n\faimed at achieving the Act's investor-protection goals.                     The\n\ninstant whistleblower protection statute creates an administrative\n\ncomplaint procedure and, ultimately a federal civil cause of\n\naction, designed to protect the \"employees of publicly traded\n\ncompanies\" who lawfully \"provide information . . . or otherwise\n\nassist in an investigation regarding any conduct which the employee\n\nbelieves constitutes a violation\" of the federal mail, wire, bank,\n\nor   securities    fraud   statutes,    any   rule   or   regulation   of   the\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), or other provision of\n\nthe Federal law relating to fraud against the shareholders.                 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1514A(a).3\n\n\n      3\n          18 U.S.C. § 1514A(a) provides:\n\n           Whistleblower protection for employees of publicly\n           traded companies.--No company with a class of\n           securities registered under section 12 of the\n           Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. § 78l), or\n           that is required to file reports under section 15(d)\n           of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. §\n           78o(d)), or any officer, employee, contractor,\n           subcontractor, or agent of such company, may\n           discharge, demote, suspend, threaten, harass, or in\n           any other manner discriminate against an employee in\n           the terms and conditions of employment because of any\n           lawful act done by the employee--\n\n           (1) to provide information, cause information to be\n           provided, or otherwise assist in an investigation\n           regarding any conduct which the employee reasonably\n           believes constitutes a violation of section 1341,\n           1343, 1344, or 1348, any rule or regulation of the\n           Securities and Exchange Commission, or any provision\n           of Federal law relating to fraud against shareholders\n           . . . ; or\n\n           (2) to file, cause to be filed, testify, participate\n\n                                       -9-\n\f            An individual complaining under this section of the Act\n\nmust, therefore, ordinarily be -- as Carnero alleges he is -- an\n\n\"employee\" of a publicly traded company subject to the Act.           Id.4\n\nBSC is a publicly traded company listed on the New York Stock\n\nExchange although its two foreign subsidiaries, BSA and BSB, for\n\nwhich Carnero directly worked, are not.           Companies subject to the\n\nAct are those \"with a class of securities registered under section\n\n12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. § 78l)\" or\n\n\"required to file reports under section 15(d) of the Securities\n\nExchange   Act    of   1934   (15    U.S.C.   §   78o(d)).\"   Id.    These\n\nregistration and reporting provisions apply to U.S. and foreign\n\ncompanies listed on U.S. securities exchanges.           See, e.g., Pinker\n\nv. Roche Holdings Ltd., 292 F.3d 361, 367 (3d Cir. 2002) (noting\n\nthat foreign securities listed on U.S. securities exchanges must\n\nabide by the Exchange Act's registration and reporting\n\nrequirements);5    see    also      http://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/\n\n\n         in, or otherwise assist in a proceeding filed or\n         about to be filed (with any knowledge of the\n         employer) relating to an alleged violation [of the\n         above].\n     4\n      18 U.S.C. § 1514A(b), the enforcement provision, allows a\n\"person\" who alleges discharge or discrimination in violation of\nsubsection (a) to seek relief. Id. § 1514A(b)(1).\n     5\n      15 U.S.C. § 78l(g)(3) (1997) allows the SEC to exempt from\nthat subsection \"any security of a foreign issuer . . . if the\nCommission finds that such exemption is in the public interest and\nis consistent with the protection of investors.\" Also, 15 U.S.C.\n§ 78o(d) (1997) provides that \"[n]othing in this subsection shall\napply to securities issued by a foreign government or political\n\n                                      -10-\n\finternatl/geographic.htm (listing more than one thousand foreign\n\ncompanies registered and reporting with the SEC as of Dec. 31,\n\n2003).\n\n            As noted, Carnero was directly in the employ of BSC's\n\nforeign subsidiaries, BSA and BSB, not themselves listed foreign\n\ncompanies.      He    claims,    however,   that    supervision     by   U.S.\n\nheadquarters personnel of the parent made him an employee of BSC\n\nalso.    Moreover, apart from that, the fact that he was employed by\n\nBSC's subsidiaries may be enough to make him a BSC \"employee\" for\n\npurposes of seeking relief under the whistleblower statute.               The\n\nDOL regulations pertaining to the whistleblower provision of the\n\nSarbanes-Oxley Act define \"employee\" as someone \"presently or\n\nformerly    working   for   a   [publicly-traded]    company   or    company\n\nrepresentative\" (emphasis supplied). The latter term is defined as\n\nincluding a \"contractor . . . or agent of a company.\"                See 29\n\nC.F.R. § 1980.101 (2005).        If BSA and BSB were agents of BSC, as\n\nseems quite possible, their own employee would fit this definition\n\nof the parent's \"employee.\" Hence Carnero, by virtue either of his\n\nown asserted contacts with BSC or his direct employment by its\n\nsubsidiaries, or both, may well be an \"employee\" of BSC for\n\npurposes of 18 U.S.C. § 1514A.        Neither party, indeed, contests\n\nthat Carnero was a covered employee of BSC for purposes of seeking\n\nwhistleblower relief under Sarbanes-Oxley.          See Collins v. Beazer\n\n\nsubdivision thereof.\"\n\n                                    -11-\n\fHomes USA, Inc., 334 F. Supp. 2d 1365, 1373 n.7 (N.D. Ga. 2004)\n\n(holding that employee of subsidiary is covered \"employee\" within\n\nmeaning of 18 U.S.C. § 1514A where officers of publicly traded\n\nparent company have authority to affect employment of subsidiary's\n\nemployees); Morefield v. Exelon Servs., Inc., 2002-SOX-2 (ALJ)\n\n(Jan. 28, 2004) (holding that \"subsidiaries, for Sarbanes-Oxley\n\npurposes, are more than mere agents like an outside auditor or\n\nconsultant . . . [they] are an integral part of the publicly traded\n\ncompany\").    We shall, therefore, assume for present purposes, but\n\nwithout deciding, that Carnero was a covered employee of BSC.               We\n\nshall also assume, for purposes of this appeal, again without\n\ndeciding, that there is evidence that Carnero's employment was\n\nterminated in retaliation for conduct protected against by 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1514A.\n\n            The whistleblower statute also makes clear that the\n\nmisconduct it protects against is not only that of the publicly\n\ntraded company itself, but also that of \"any officer, employee,\n\ncontractor,       subcontractor,   or     agent    of   such   company,\"    who\n\nretaliates or otherwise discriminates against the whistleblowing\n\nemployee.    See 18 U.S.C. § 1514A(a).        Thus, the statute can be read\n\nto embrace an agent-subsidiary's retaliation against a protected\n\nemployee.     As Carnero may be an \"employee\" of BSC, supra, his\n\nalleged retaliatory discharge by its subsidiaries for reasons\n\nforbidden    in    the   Act   could    (putting   aside   any   question    of\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fextraterritorial        application)       violate     the    terms    of     the\n\nwhistleblower protection provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n\n             We conclude, therefore, that if Carnero's whistleblowing\n\nhad occurred in this country relative to similar alleged domestic\n\nmisconduct by domestic subsidiaries, he might well have a potential\n\nclaim under the whistleblower protection provision of the Sarbanes-\n\nOxley Act.    This being so, we proceed to the next question, whether\n\nthe whistleblower provision of the Act has extraterritorial effect,\n\nso that a foreign employee such as Carnero who complains of\n\nmisconduct abroad by overseas subsidiaries, may bring suit under\n\nthe whistleblower provision of Sarbanes-Oxley against the listed\n\nUnited States parent company.          We think not.\n\n             B.   The Presumption Against Extraterritorial Application\n\n\n             Carnero argues that the whistleblower protection statute,\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1514A, should be given extraterritorial effect, so as\n\nto allow him to pursue in federal court his whistleblower claim\n\nbrought under its provisions.           He says his claim not only fits\n\nwithin the literal language of the statute, supra, but that to\n\nlimit the operation of the statute to purely domestic conduct in\n\nthe United States would improperly insulate the foreign operations\n\nof covered companies.         This, he says, would frustrate the basic\n\npurpose of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of which the whistleblower\n\nprotection    statute    at   issue   is   a   part,   to    protect   both   the\n\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\finvestors in U.S. securities markets and the integrity of those\n\nmarkets.\n\n            While Carnero's argument has some force, it faces a high\n\nand   we   think     insurmountable         hurdle        in    the   well-established\n\npresumption        against        the     extraterritorial            application     of\n\nCongressional statutes.           Where, as here, a statute is silent as to\n\nits territorial reach, and no contrary congressional intent clearly\n\nappears,     there        is     generally       a     presumption       against     its\n\nextraterritorial application. E.E.O.C. v. Arabian Am. Oil Co., 499\n\nU.S. 244, 248 (1991) (\"Aramco\") (\"It is a longstanding principle of\n\nAmerican law 'that legislation of Congress, unless a contrary\n\nintent appears, is meant to apply only within the territorial\n\njurisdiction of the United States.'\") (quoting Foley Bros., 336\n\nU.S. at 285); see also Small v. United States, 125 S. Ct. 1752,\n\n1755 (2005) (recognizing that presumption is alive and well).                         In\n\nthe   present     case,        whatever   help       to     investors    its    overseas\n\napplication might in theory provide is offset not only by the\n\nabsence      of     any        indication        that       Congress      contemplated\n\nextraterritoriality but by a variety of indications that Congress\n\nthought the statute was limited to the territorial jurisdiction of\n\nthe United States.\n\n            The Supreme Court stated in Aramco that a court is to\n\nassume     that    Congress       legislates         with      an   awareness   of   the\n\npresumption against extraterritorial application. 499 U.S. at 248.\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\fThus,   the    presumption    can    be     overcome    only   if    there     is   an\n\n\"'affirmative intention of the Congress clearly expressed.'\"                    Id.,\n\n(quoting Benz v. Compania Naviera Hidalgo, S.A., 353 U.S. 138, 147\n\n(1957)); see Smith v. United States, 507 U.S. 197, 204 (1993)\n\n(requiring     \"clear   evidence     of     congressional      intent\"   to    apply\n\nstatute extraterritorially).          In searching for clear evidence of\n\nCongress's intent, courts consider \"all available evidence\" about\n\nthe meaning of the statute, including its text, context, structure,\n\nand legislative history.       Cf. Sale v. Haitian Ctrs. Council, Inc.,\n\n509 U.S. 155, 177 (1993).\n\n              The   presumption     serves    at   least    two    purposes.        It\n\nprotects against \"unintended clashes between our laws and those of\n\nother nations which could result in international discord,\" and it\n\nreflects      the   notion   that    when    Congress      legislates,    it    \"'is\n\nprimarily concerned with domestic conditions.'\"                   Aramco, 499 U.S.\n\nat 248, (quoting Foley Bros., 336 U.S. at 285).                The Supreme Court\n\nhas invoked the presumption in several cases involving the scope of\n\nbroad regulatory statutes.            See, e.g., Sale, 509 U.S. at 173\n\n(holding that section 243(h) of Immigration and Nationality Act of\n\n1952 did not protect aliens seized by authorities on high seas,\n\ndespite broad language in statute referring to \"any alien\");\n\nAramco, 499 U.S. at 249 (holding that the version of Title VII of\n\nCivil Rights Act of 1964 then in force did not regulate employment\n\npractices of U.S. firms employing U.S. citizens abroad, even though\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\fthe statute contained broad provisions extending its prohibitions\n\nto,   for    example,          \"any    activity,       business,         or    industry     in\n\ncommerce\"); Foley Bros., 336 U.S. at 285 (holding that federal\n\nlabor statute requiring an eight-hour day provision in \"[e]very\n\ncontract made to which the United States . . . is a party\" did not\n\napply to contracts for work performed in foreign countries).\n\n             To    be    sure,    in    appropriate         circumstances           Congress's\n\nextraterritorial         intent       has    on   occasion        been    implied      without\n\nexplicit statement in the text or even history.                          Courts, as noted,\n\nwill examine a statute's context and structure as well as its\n\npurpose     and    \"all    available         evidence\"       in    order       to   determine\n\nCongress's actual intent.               Cf. Sale, 509 U.S. at 177.                     Carnero\n\nwould, as noted, have us find implicit evidence of Congress's\n\nintent to apply the Act extraterritorially in the Act's purpose to\n\nprotect U.S. investors and markets against frauds.                            Frauds against\n\nforeign     subsidiaries        uncovered         by   foreign     whistleblowers         may,\n\nundoubtedly, threaten U.S. investors in the parent just as do\n\ndomestic frauds.\n\n             Carnero refers us to cases such as United States v.\n\nBowman,      260        U.S.     94,        98     (1922)     (presumption             against\n\nextraterritoriality held not to limit a federal criminal statute,\n\nthe terms of which were violated by U.S. citizens when they\n\nconspired abroad to defraud a domestic company partly owned by the\n\nUnited States government).                  Similarly, Carnero notes that the\n\n\n                                             -16-\n\fSupreme Court has held the Sherman Act to apply to anti-competitive\n\nconduct abroad \"that was meant to produce and did in fact produce\n\nsome substantial effect in the United States.\"           Hartford Fire Ins.\n\nCo. v. California, 509 U.S. 764, 796 (1993).                  See also, e.g.,\n\nSchoenbaum v. Firstbrook, 405 F.2d 200, 206 (2d Cir. 1968) (civil\n\nantifraud provisions of the Exchange Act given extraterritorial\n\napplication to protect American investors who purchase foreign\n\nsecurities on American exchanges and to protect the domestic\n\nsecurities market from the effects of improper foreign transactions\n\nin American securities).\n\n              But while the Sarbanes-Oxley purpose to protect investors\n\nand build confidence in U.S. securities markets may be a factor\n\nsupporting       extraterritorial    application         of     the      instant\n\nwhistleblower protection provision, the other pertinent factors run\n\nstrongly counter to finding an extraterritorial legislative intent.\n\nThese contrary indicia prevent our determining that Congress has\n\nevidenced its \"clear intent\" for extraterritorial application. Not\n\nonly is the text of 18 U.S.C. § 1514A silent as to any intent to\n\napply it abroad, the statute's legislative history indicates that\n\nCongress gave no consideration to either the possibility or the\n\nproblems of overseas application.           In sharp contrast with this\n\nsilence, Congress has provided expressly elsewhere in the Sarbanes-\n\nOxley   Act     for   extraterritorial     enforcement    of    a     different,\n\ncriminal,     whistleblower   statute.       By   so   providing,       Congress\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fdemonstrated that it was well able to call for extraterritorial\n\napplication when it so desired.               Also in the Act, Congress has\n\nprovided expressly for the exterritorial application of certain\n\nother unrelated statutes, tailoring these so as to cope with\n\nproblems   of    sovereignty     and   the     like   --    again   demonstrating\n\nCongress's ability to provide for foreign application when it\n\nwished. Here, however, while placing the whistleblower provision's\n\nenforcement in the hands of the DOL, a domestic agency, Congress\n\nhas made no provision for possible problems arising when that\n\nagency   seeks   to   regulate    employment      relationships       in   foreign\n\nnations, nor has Congress provided the DOL with special powers and\n\nresources to conduct investigations abroad.                Furthermore, judicial\n\nvenue provisions written into the whistleblower protection statute\n\nwere made expressly applicable only to whistleblower violations\n\nwithin the United States and to complainants residing here on the\n\ndate of violation, with no corresponding basis being provided for\n\nvenue as to foreign complainants claiming violations in foreign\n\ncountries.\n\n           These factors, and more, not only fail to imply a clear\n\ncongressional intent for extraterritorial application, but indicate\n\nthat Congress never expected such application.                  We discuss them\n\nbelow.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\f             1.    Provisions and Structure of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\n\n\n             The whistleblower protection statute in 18 U.S.C. § 1514A\n\nis one part of the Corporate and Criminal Fraud Accountability Act\n\nof 2002.     It is incorporated as Title VIII, Section 806, within the\n\nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-204, 116 Stat. 745\n\n(July 30, 2002).        The Sarbanes-Oxley Act itself is a major piece of\n\nlegislation       bundling    together    a     large    number   of   diverse   and\n\nindependent statutes, all designed to improve the quality of and\n\ntransparency       in   financial   reporting       and     auditing    of   public\n\ncompanies.        The Act increases criminal penalties for securities\n\nfraud and other violations and provides for the promulgation of\n\ncodes   of    ethics    and   various     other    means    for   holding    public\n\ncompanies to higher reporting standards.\n\n             A major part of the Act is devoted to creating a new\n\nbody, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which, serving\n\nunder the Securities and Exchange Commission, will supervise and\n\nregulate the activities of public accounting firms. The latter, in\n\nturn, are made responsible for auditing public companies.                    Unlike\n\nthe present whistleblower protection provision contained in Section\n\n806, which makes no reference to foreign entities, Section 106 of\n\nthe Act deals expressly with foreign accounting firms, requiring\n\nthem to register with the Board if they audit public companies but\n\ncarving out exceptions tailored to difficulties inherent in U.S.\n\nregulation of overseas professionals.                   See 15 U.S.C. § 7216(c)\n\n                                         -19-\n\f(2005) (providing that the SEC or the Board may, as it \"determines\n\nnecessary     or   appropriate   in   the    public    interest     or   for   the\n\nprotection of investors,\" exempt a foreign public accounting firm\n\nfrom the Act).         The accounting provision reflects Congress's\n\nrecognition     that   the   application     of   domestic   U.S.    regulatory\n\nstatutes to persons abroad presents problems in addition to those\n\nof purely domestic application, and of the need to address those\n\nproblems specifically.\n\n             Besides the whistleblower statute here at issue, found in\n\nSection 806 of the Act, two other separate provisions in Sarbanes-\n\nOxley deal with whistleblower protection.              Section 301 of the Act\n\nrequires the audit committees of issuers (which include foreign\n\nissuers)6 to implement internal procedures that facilitate and\n\nencourage     \"anonymous\"     whistleblowing      by    employees    concerning\n\n\"questionable accounting or auditing matters.\"               See 15 U.S.C. §\n\n78j-1(m)(4) (2005).7         Section 301 does not, however, purport to\n\n\n     6\n      \"Issuer\" is defined in Section 2(a)(7) of the Act as \"an\nissuer (as defined in section 3 of the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c)), the securities of which are registered under\nsection 12 of that Act (15 U.S.C. 78l), or that is required to file\nreports under section 15(d) (15 U.S.C. 78o(d)), or that files or\nhas filed a registration statement that has not yet become\neffective under the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.),\nand that it has not withdrawn.\" The definition of \"issuer\" is thus\nslightly broader than the definition of companies subject to the\nwhistleblower protection provision, since it includes any company\nthat has not yet become listed on a U.S. securities exchange.\n     7\n         15 U.S.C. § 78j-1(m)(4) provides:\n\n          Complaints.--Each audit committee shall establish\n\n                                      -20-\n\fconfer enforceable rights upon employees, hence does not implicate\n\nthe foreign sovereignty and other concerns, infra, raised by a\n\nprovision like Section 806 providing for an adjudicatory process\n\nand remedies.8\n\n            The other whistleblower provision found in the Sarbanes-\n\nOxley Act, Section 1107, is significant here by way of contrast to\n\nthe instant Section 806.     Section 1107 amended 18 U.S.C. § 1513\n\n\n\n\n         procedures for--(A) the receipt, retention, and\n         treatment of complaints received by the issuer\n         regarding accounting, internal accounting controls,\n         or auditing matters; and (B) the confidential,\n         anonymous submission by employees of the issuer of\n         concerns   regarding  questionable   accounting  or\n         auditing matters.\n     8\n      Section 307 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act directs the SEC to\n\"issue rules, in the public interest and for the protection of\ninvestors, setting forth minimum standards of professional conduct\nfor attorneys appearing and practicing before the Commission in any\nway in the representation of issuers,\" including a rule requiring\nthe internal reporting \"of a material violation of securities law\nor breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by the company or\nany agent thereof.\" See 15 U.S.C. § 7245 (2005). The SEC has\napplied this internal reporting provision to domestic and foreign\nattorneys. See 17 C.F.R. § 205.2(a)(2)(ii), (c), and (j) (2005)\n(defining \"attorney\" to include \"any person who is admitted,\nlicensed, or otherwise qualified to practice law in any\njurisdiction, domestic or foreign,\" but excepting a \"non-appearing\nforeign attorney\"); see generally Implementation of Standards of\nProfessional Conduct for Attorneys, 68 Fed. Reg. 6296-01, 2003 WL\n247093 (Feb. 6, 2003) (SEC Final Rule implementing Section 307).\n     As with Section 301, we find this provision of limited value\nin discerning the geographic reach of the employee protections in\nSection 806. It does not implicate the foreign sovereignty and\nother concerns that are raised by a provision providing for an\nadjudicatory process and remedies.\n\n                                -21-\n\f(2000 & Supp. 2005) by adding subsection (e)9 providing criminal\n\nsanctions        for     retaliation       against        anyone   giving      truthful\n\ninformation to law enforcement officers relating to the commission\n\nof    any     federal       offense.10      There     is     express    provision    for\n\nextraterritorial jurisdiction of § 1513 including subsection (e).\n\nSee   18      U.S.C.    §    1513(d)     (\"There     is    extraterritorial     Federal\n\njurisdiction over an offense under this section.\").                      That Congress\n\nprovided for extraterritorial reach as to Section 1107 but did not\n\ndo so as to Section 806 (the provision relevant here) conveys the\n\nimplication       that      Congress     did   not    mean    Section    806   to   have\n\nextraterritorial effect.            See Russello v. United States, 464 U.S.\n\n16, 23 (1983) (\"'[W]here Congress includes particular language in\n\none section of a statute but omits it in another section of the\n\nsame Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally\n\nand purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.'\") (citation\n\nomitted);       see also Aramco, 499 U.S. at 258 (\"Congress' awareness\n\nof the need to make a clear statement that a statute applies\n\n\n       9\n      It appears that through a drafting error, Congress enacted\ntwo subsections (e).

Legislative History\n\n              The legislative history of the instant Section 806, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1514A, gives no indication that Congress meant to apply\n\nits   civil    whistleblower   protections     extraterritorially.   The\n\nrelevant congressional debate focused upon concern over the lack of\n\nwhistleblower protection for private corporate employees in many\n\nstates of the union.        The original version of the statute was\n\nintroduced by Senator Leahy and three cosponsors (Senators Daschle,\n\nDurbin and Harkin) on March 12, 2002, see 148 Cong. Rec. S1783-01,\n\n2002 WL 384616, and reported by the Committee on the Judiciary on\n\nMay 6, 2002, see S. Rep. 107-146, 2002 WL 863249.          Senator Leahy\n\nexplained that the purpose of the statute was to provide federal\n\nprotection to private corporate whistleblowers, as was already done\n\nwith government employees, in light of the \"patchwork and vagaries\n\nof current state [whistleblower protection] laws.\"           See S. Rep.\n\n107-146, at 10 (emphasis added).         Senator Leahy addressed the need\n\nto provide federal protection where state laws failed to protect\n\ncertain private corporate whistleblowers, like Sherron Watkins, an\n\nemployee at Enron Corporation in Texas.         It is pertinent to quote\n\nSenator Leahy's statements at length:\n\n              In a variety of instances when corporate\n              employees at both Enron and [Arthur] Andersen\n\n                                   -23-\n\fattempted to report or \"blow the whistle\" on\nfraud, [] they were discouraged at nearly\nevery turn. For instance, a shocking e-mail\nfrom Enron's outside lawyers to an Enron\nofficial was uncovered. This e-mail responds\nto a request for legal advice after a senior\nEnron employee, Sherron Watkins, tried to\nreport   accounting   irregularities   at  the\nhighest levels of the company in late August\n2001. The outside lawyer[] counseled Enron,\nin pertinent part, as follows: You asked that\nI include in this communication a summary of\nthe possible risks associated with discharging\n(or constructively discharging) employees who\nreport allegations of improper accounting\npractices: 1. Texas law does not currently\nprotect corporate whistleblowers. The [Texas]\nsupreme court has twice declined to create a\ncause of action for whistleblowers who are\ndischarged * * *\n\n. . . .\n\nAccording to media accounts, this was not an\nisolated example of whistleblowing associated\nwith the Enron case. . . . . These examples\nfurther expose a culture, supported by law,\nthat discourage employees from reporting\nfraudulent behavior not only to the proper\nauthorities, such as the FBI and the SEC, but\neven internally.    This \"corporate code of\nsilence\" not only hampers investigations, but\nalso   creates   a  climate   where   ongoing\nwrongdoing can occur with virtual impunity.\nThe consequences of this corporate code of\nsilence for investors in publicly traded\ncompanies, in particular, and for the stock\nmarket, in general, are serious and adverse,\nand they must be remedied.\n\n. . . .\n\nCorporate employees who report fraud are\nsubject to the patchwork and vagaries of\ncurrent state laws, although most publicly\ntraded companies do business nationwide.\nThus, a whistleblowing employee in one state\nmay be far more vulnerable to retaliation than\n\n                    -24-\n\f                a fellow employee in another state who takes\n                the    same   actions.    Unfortunately,    as\n                demonstrated   in    the   tobacco    industry\n                litigation and the Enron case, efforts to\n                quiet whistleblowers and retaliate against\n                them for being \"disloyal\" or \"litigation\n                risks\" transcend state lines. This corporate\n                culture must change, and the law can lead the\n                way.   That is why S. 2010 is supported by\n                public interest advocates, such as the\n                National Whistleblower Center, the Government\n                Accountability Project, and Taxpayers Against\n                Fraud, who have called this bill \"the single\n                most effective measure possible to prevent\n                recurrences of the Enron debacle and similar\n                threats to the nation's financial markets.\"\n\n                . . . .\n\n                The bill does not supplant or replace state\n                law, but sets a national floor for employee\n                protections in the context of publicly traded\n                companies.\n\nId. at 4-5, 10, 20.11\n\n                Other   parts   of   the    legislative   history   confirm    the\n\nlegislators' focus on problems within the United States.

Rec. S1725-01, S1725, 2003 WL 193278 (Jan. 29, 2003).\n\nSenator Leahy's overall statements that day were directed to the\n\nWhite   House's   incorrect     interpretation       that    a    whistleblower's\n\ndisclosure to Congress would only be protected if made to a member\n\nconducting an investigation.            The specific statement cited by\n\nCarnero, however, was once again focusing on the need for federal\n\nprotection    where     state    law      failed     to     protect       corporate\n\nwhistleblowers.    Here is the statement in context:\n\n           The law was designed to protect people like\n           Sherron Watkins from Enron . . . from\n           retaliation when they report fraud to Federal\n           investigators, regulators, or to any Member of\n           Congress. The law was intentionally written\n           to sweep broadly, protecting any employee of a\n           publicly   traded   company  who   took   such\n           reasonable action to try to protect investors\n           and the market.\n\n           The reason that Senator Grassley and I know so\n           much about the legislative intent behind this\n           provision is that we crafted it together last\n           year in the Judiciary Committee and worked to\n           make it part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act on the\n           Senate floor. We had both seen enough cases\n\n                                       -27-\n\f           where corporate employees who possessed the\n           courage to stand up and \"do the right thing\"\n           found out the hard way that there is a severe\n           penalty for breaking the \"corporate code of\n           silence.\" Indeed, in the Enron case itself we\n           discovered an e-mail from outside counsel that\n           noted that the Texas Supreme Court had twice\n           refused to find a legal protection for\n           corporate whistleblowers and that implicitly\n           gave Enron the go ahead to fire Ms. Watkins\n           for reporting accounting irregularities.\n\nId. (emphasis added).\n\n           The legislative history thus suggests that Congress was\n\nconcerned about providing whistleblower protections for corporate\n\nemployees in the various states.           Nowhere in the legislative\n\nhistory is there any indication that 18 U.S.C. § 1514A was drafted\n\nwith the purpose of extending to foreign employees working in\n\nnations   outside    of   the   United    States    the    right   to   seek\n\nadministrative and judicial civil relief under the Act.            While the\n\nlegislative history contains repeated references to the \"states,\"\n\nparticularly Texas, there are no parallel references to foreign\n\ncountries.12   See Foley Bros., 336 U.S. at 286-87 (holding that\n\nfederal Eight Hour Law did not apply overseas where legislative\n\nhistory   revealed   that   Congress     was   primarily   concerned    with\n\ndomestic employment conditions).\n\n\n     12\n      The legislative history also indicates that the whistleblower\nprotections for corporate employees were meant to closely track the\nprotections offered to airline employees under the Wendell H. Ford\nAviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (\"AIR21\"),\n49 U.S.C. § 42121 (2005). See S. Rep. 107-146, at 26. We have\nfound no indication that AIR21's whistleblower protections apply\nextraterritorially.\n\n                                  -28-\n\f          By contrast, the legislative history of certain other\n\nprovisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act shows that Congress expressly\n\nconsidered the application of those provisions to foreign entities.\n\nFor instance, Section 106, whose text as already mentioned applies\n\nto foreign public accounting firms, also has history revealing\n\nCongress's thoughts in applying that statute abroad.         See S. Rep.\n\n107-205, at 11, 2002 WL 1443523 (July 3, 2002).        Senator Sarbanes\n\nstated:\n\n          Companies that sell shares to U.S. investors,\n          and are subject to the federal securities\n          laws, can be organized and operate in any part\n          of the world. Their financial statements are\n          not necessarily audited by U.S. accounting\n          firms, and the Committee believes that there\n          should be no difference in treatment of a\n          public company's auditors under the bill\n          simply because of a particular auditor's place\n          of operation.      Otherwise, a significant\n          loophole in the protection offered U.S.\n          investors would be built into the statutory\n          system.\n\n\n          Thus, accounting firms organized under the\n          laws of countries other than the United States\n          that issue audit reports for public companies\n          subject to the U.S. securities laws are\n          covered by the bill in the same manner as\n          domestic accounting firms, subject to the\n          exemptive authority of both the [Public\n          Company Accounting Oversight] Board and the\n          SEC.\n\n\n          Section   302   of   the   Act   provides   that   a   company's\n\nprincipal executive officers and principal financial officers, or\n\npersons performing similar functions, must certify the material\n\n\n                                 -29-\n\fcompleteness and accuracy of SEC filings.         See 15 U.S.C. § 7241\n\n(2005).   While   the   statute   itself   does   not   indicate   whether\n\nofficers of both U.S. and foreign companies are covered, its\n\nlegislative history is suggestive on the subject.          See 148 Cong.\n\nRec. S6687-01, S6698, 2002 WL 1486863 (July 12, 2002).             Senator\n\nGraham stated:\n\n          If companies are being publically traded in\n          the United States, regardless of where their\n          headquarters are located, they ought to be\n          required   to   meet   the  same   level  of\n          accountability that we are establishing for\n          everyone else in this legislation.\n\n\n          Other parts of the legislative history reveal Congress's\n\nsensitivity to the application of some of the Act's provisions to\n\nforeign entities.   Some members of Congress, for instance, were\n\nreluctant to impose U.S. corporate reforms on countries with\n\nadequate or superior corporate governance regimes.         See 148 Cong.\n\nRec. S7350-04, S7356, 2002 WL 1724193 (July 25, 2002).             Senator\n\nEnzi commented:\n\n          I believe we need to be clear with respect to\n          the area of foreign issuers and their coverage\n          under the bill's broad definitions.      While\n          foreign issuers can be listed and traded in\n          the U.S. if they agree to conform to GAAP and\n          New York Stock Exchange rules, the SEC\n          historically has permitted the home country of\n          the issuer to implement corporate governance\n          standards.   Foreign issuers are not part of\n          the current problems being seen in the U.S.\n          capital markets, and I do not believe it was\n          the intent of the conferees to export U.S.\n          standards disregarding the sovereignty of\n          other    countries    as   well    as    their\n\n                                  -30-\n\f           regulators. . . . Under the conference report,\n           section 3(a) [which was enacted] gives the SEC\n           wide   authority    to   enact    implementing\n           regulations that are \"necessary or appropriate\n           in the public interest.\" I believe it is the\n           intent of the conferees to permit the\n           Commission wide latitude in using their\n           rulemaking authority to deal with technical\n           matters such as the scope of the definitions\n           and their applicability to foreign issuers.\n\n\n           The foregoing show Congress's keen awareness of the\n\napplication     of   some   of   the   Sarbanes-Oxley         Act   provisions   to\n\nentities   in   other      countries   and    of   the   associated      problems.\n\nAccordingly, Congress's complete silence as to overseas application\n\nof the instant whistleblower protection provision (combined with\n\nCongress's repeated reference to the need for that provision to\n\nsupplement state enforcement), provides significant indication that\n\nCongress   did       not    intend     18     U.S.C.     §     1514A     to   apply\n\nextraterritorially.\n\n           3.    Other Factors\n\n           Other factors lend support to the conclusion that the\n\nwhistleblower protection provision in 18 U.S.C. § 1514A was not\n\nmeant to apply extraterritorially.\n\n           a.    Problems of Extraterritorial Enforcement\n\n           If    the    whistleblower       protection       provision   is   given\n\nextraterritorial reach in a case like the present one, it would\n\nempower U.S. courts and a U.S. agency, the DOL, to delve into the\n\nemployment relationship between foreign employers and their foreign\n\n\n                                       -31-\n\femployees. Carnero, whose direct employers were two Latin American\n\ncorporations, has asked the United States district court for, among\n\nother relief, his reinstatement. The door would thus be opened for\n\nU.S. courts to examine and adjudicate relationships abroad that\n\nwould normally be handled by a foreign country's own courts and\n\ngovernment agencies pursuant to its own laws.               In enacting other\n\nlaws   that   affect   employment    relationships         extraterritorially,\n\nmembers of Congress have recognized \"the well-established principle\n\nof sovereignty . . . that no nation has the right to impose its\n\nlabor standards on another country.\"            See S. Rep. 98-467, at 27-28\n\n(1984), reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2974, 3000-01 (limiting age\n\ndiscrimination    law's   extraterritorial         reach    to   U.S.   citizens\n\nemployed by U.S. corporations or their subsidiaries in countries\n\nthat do not have inconsistent laws); see also Foley Bros., 336 U.S.\n\nat 578 (noting that \"labor conditions [of its own citizens] are the\n\nprimary concern of a foreign country\"). We believe if Congress had\n\nintended that the whistleblower provision would apply abroad to\n\nforeign entities, it would have said so, and certainly would have\n\nconsidered, before enacting the law, the problems and limits of\n\nextraterritorial enforcement.            Yet Congress did not at any time\n\ndiscuss the interest other countries would have in regulating these\n\nemployment    relationships,       nor    did    Congress    include     in   the\n\nwhistleblower    provision   any    mechanism      for   resolving      potential\n\nconflicts with foreign labor laws and procedures.                    Congress's\n\n\n                                     -32-\n\fcomplete silence suggests that it had no thought or intention to\n\napply this provision to foreign employees and entities as now\n\nproposed.\n\n                Further suggestive of Congress's lack of extraterritorial\n\nintent is its failure to provide any mechanism for enforcing the\n\nwhistleblower protections in a foreign setting.                       Congress did not\n\ngrant,         or    even     discuss       the   granting    of,     extraterritorial\n\ninvestigatory powers to the Department of Labor, the agency charged\n\nwith administering whistleblower complaints.13 See Aramco, 499 U.S.\n\nat   256       (concluding      that       Congress's    restrictive       intent   as    to\n\ngeographic           reach    of     Title    VII     was   evidenced       by   lack     of\n\nextraterritorial             venue     and    other     enforcement        mechanisms     in\n\nstatute).           No reference is made to providing for interpreters, for\n\ncoordinating with the Department of State, or for the utilization\n\nof foreign personnel.               Significantly, the DOL is given only sixty\n\ndays to complete its entire investigation of a complaint and to\n\nissue        findings       under    the    procedure    mandated     by    49   U.S.C.    §\n\n42121(b)(2)(A).14            See 18 U.S.C. § 1514A(b)(2).             This short time\n\n\n      13\n      The DOL has been charged with administering whistleblower\ncomplaints in a variety of employment contexts, even where another\nagency, having the technical expertise in the subject area of the\ncomplaints (such as the SEC here), has overall control. See, e.g.,\nKansas Gas & Elec. Co. v. Brock, 780 F.2d 1505, 1509 (10th Cir.\n1985) (noting that DOL administers nuclear energy employee\nwhistleblower complaints, even though the Nuclear Regulatory\nCommission has expertise on nuclear issues).\n        14\n             49 U.S.C. § 42121(b)(2)(A) provides, in relevant part:\n\n\n                                              -33-\n\fframe       seems   unrealistic   if   the   DOL     were   expected   to   conduct\n\ninvestigations overseas.15         Moreover, if an administrative hearing\n\nis held, the hearing \"shall be conducted expeditiously\" under 49\n\nU.S.C. § 42121(b)(2)(A).          See id.    There is no provision either for\n\nthe resources or the flexibility that might be needed in dealing\n\nwith    foreign      matters;   and,   as    said,    the   legislative     history\n\ncontains no discussion of this or other problems likely to arise\n\nhad Congress meant this provision to apply outside the territorial\n\nUnited States.         The statute, it must be remembered, protects a\n\nwhistleblowing employee from retaliation or other discrimination by\n\na publicly traded company, or \"any officer, employee, contractor,\n\n\n\n            Not later than 60 days after the date of receipt of\n            a complaint filed under paragraph (1) and after\n            affording the person named in the complaint an\n            opportunity to submit to the Secretary of Labor a\n            written response to the complaint and an opportunity\n            to meet with a representative of the Secretary to\n            present statements from witnesses, the Secretary of\n            Labor shall conduct an investigation and determine\n            whether there is reasonable cause to believe that the\n            complaint has merit and notify, in writing, the\n            complainant and the person alleged to have committed\n            a violation of subsection (a) of the Secretary's\n            findings.\n       15\n      While other whistleblower protection statutes provide for a\nsixty-day investigation time frame, see Procedures for the Handling\nof Discrimination Complaints Under Section 806 of the Corporate and\nCriminal Fraud Accountability Act of 2002, Title VIII of the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 69 Fed. Reg. 52104-01, 52108, 2004 WL\n1876043 (Aug. 24, 2004) (\"Sarbanes-Oxley Regulations\") (citing\nAIR21 and the Surface Transportation Assistance Act), to our\nknowledge,   none   of    these   statutes   have    been   applied\nextraterritorially to employees resident and working outside of the\nUnited States.\n\n                                       -34-\n\fsubcontractor, or agent of such company.\"     Id. § 1514A(a).     If the\n\nstatute has extraterritorial effect, this broad coverage would\n\ncreate an expansive class of potential whistleblowers by extending\n\nits protections to countless employees in countless areas around\n\nthe world.     And yet, there is no discussion about the increased\n\nadministrative and logistical burdens that would fall on the DOL to\n\nadminister such a far-reaching statute.            These omissions are\n\nstriking.     They indicate that Congress did not focus on the\n\npossibility of extraterritorial application, with its attendant\n\nproblems.\n\n            b. The Venue Provisions Contemplate Domestic Claims Only\n\n            The whistleblower provision in question includes venue\n\nprovisions instructing as to the particular federal court within\n\nwhich judicial claims are to be brought.            There is no venue\n\nprovision specifically tailored to claims based on conduct abroad,\n\nand, significantly, two of the venue provisions for various stages\n\nof court review would exclude foreign claims of the instant sort.\n\n            For whistleblower complaints brought under 18 U.S.C. §\n\n1514A, the Act incorporates by reference the procedural structure\n\nfor   whistleblower   complaints    filed   with   the   United   States\n\nDepartment of Labor under the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment\n\nand Reform Act for the 21st Century (\"AIR21\"), 49 U.S.C. § 42121\n\n(2005).     Id. § 1514A(b)(2)(A) (\"An action under paragraph (1)(A)\n\nshall be governed under the rules and procedures set forth in\n\n\n                                   -35-\n\fsection 42121(b) of title                 49 United States Code.\").16             AIR21\n\ncontains nothing prescribing a federal venue for whistleblower\n\ncomplaints or appeals based on conduct abroad, brought by employees\n\nresident and working in a foreign country.                     While de novo review,\n\nsuch as in this case, may be sought \"in the appropriate district\n\ncourt        of   the    United      States,\"   the    \"appropriate     court\"   is   not\n\ndefined, 18 U.S.C. § 1514A(b)(1)(B).                   49 U.S.C. § 42121(b)(6) and\n\nrelated provisions suggest that the appropriate court is one in the\n\njurisdiction of which the whistleblower violation occurred or the\n\ncomplainant resided.                 Hence 49 U.S.C. § 42121(b)(4)(A) provides\n\nthat appeal from the Secretary's final order should be directed to\n\nthe   federal           court   of    appeals   \"for    the   circuit   in   which    the\n\nviolation, with respect to which the order was issued, allegedly\n\n\n        16\n      The \"Whistleblower Protection Program\" under AIR21 provides\nfor: (1) the filing of a complaint with the Secretary of Labor\nalleging   retaliatory   discharge   or  discrimination;   (2)   an\nopportunity for the person named in the complaint to submit a\nwritten response and meet with a representative of the Secretary to\npresent witness statements; (3) an investigation by the Secretary\ninto the merits of the complaint; (4) a preliminary order by the\nSecretary providing relief, including reinstatement, if there is\nreasonable cause to believe a violation occurred, (5) the\nopportunity to file objections and request a hearing; (6) a final\norder by the Secretary providing relief or denying the complaint;\n(7) appellate court review of the Secretary's final order; and (8)\nenforcement of the final order in the federal district court by the\nSecretary or parties. See 49 U.S.C. § 42121(b).\n     The DOL regulations implementing AIR21 and Sarbanes-Oxley\nwhistleblower protection provisions provide for the receipt and\ninvestigation of complaints by OSHA, hearings by the Office of\nAdministrative Law Judges, and appeals of ALJ decisions by the\nAdministrative Review Board (all acting on behalf of the Secretary\nof Labor).     See 29 C.F.R. pt. 1980 (2005) (Sarbanes-Oxley\nRegulations); 29 C.F.R. pt. 1979 (2005) (AIR21 Regulations).\n\n                                            -36-\n\foccurred or the circuit in which the complainant resided on the\n\ndate of such violation.\"      Section 42121(b)(5) provides that the\n\nSecretary may enforce a final order by filing a civil action \"in\n\nthe United States district court for the district in which the\n\nviolation was found to occur.\"        Even if the \"appropriate court\"\n\nlanguage is broadly construed to allow venue at a stage like the\n\npresent, the above restrictive venue provisions would deny venue at\n\nother key stages of proceedings instituted by a foreign employee.\n\nFor Congress to have deliberately created such a discrepancy would\n\nseem highly improbable.     It is more likely Congress simply did not\n\ncontemplate the filing of administrative complaints by foreign\n\nemployees working abroad, and hence enacted no comprehensive set of\n\nvenue provisions suited to that eventuality.\n\n          c.   The Department of Labor's Preliminary Rulings\n\n          The DOL has not issued any policy statement on the\n\ngeographic reach of the whistleblower protection statute.        Indeed,\n\nthe DOL has declined to make a statement of policy.        When asked by\n\ncommentators prior to the promulgation of its final regulations to\n\nexclude from the statute's coverage employees working outside of\n\nthe United States, the DOL replied:       \"The purpose of this rule is\n\nto   provide   procedures    for    the   handling   of   Sarbanes-Oxley\n\ndiscrimination complaints; this rule is not intended to provide\n\nstatutory interpretations.\"        See Sarbanes-Oxley Regulations, 69\n\nFed. Reg. 52104-01, 52105, 2004 WL 1876043 (Aug. 24, 2004).\n\n\n                                   -37-\n\f            OSHA's        Regional         Administrator          and   the      DOL's\n\nAdministrative Law Judges, however, have held on at least three\n\noccasions    (in       this   case   and    two     others)     while   adjudicating\n\nwhistleblower complaints under 18 U.S.C. § 1514A that the statute\n\ndoes not apply extraterritorially to employees working outside of\n\nthe United States, based on their examination of the statute and\n\ntheir interpretation of the case law.                     See Carnero v. Boston\n\nScientific Corp., 2004-SOX-22 (OSHA Reg'l Adm'r) (Dec. 19, 2003);\n\nConcone v. Capital One Fin. Corp., 2005-SOX-6 (ALJ) (Dec. 3, 2004);\n\nEde v. Swatch Group, 2004-SOX-68, 2004-SOX-69 (ALJ) (Jan. 14,\n\n2005). These determinations suggest at least the misgivings of the\n\ndesignated enforcement agency about interpreting 18 U.S.C. § 1514A\n\nas embracing extraterritorial enforcement.\n\n            4.     No Clear Expression of Congressional Intent\n\n            Whether to confer extraterritorial effect is a policy\n\nchoice    for    Congress.        Our    role      is   limited    to   ascertaining\n\nCongress's intent.            \"In essence, [the foreign claimant such as\n\nCarnero] asks this court to conclude that Congress balanced [the\n\nprovision's]      important      goals     against      the   foreign    sovereignty\n\nconcerns that underlie the presumption against extraterritoriality,\n\nconsidered       the    implications       of     application     abroad   and   then\n\naddressed these concerns by inviting courts to read between the\n\nlines.\"    Boureslan v. Aramco, Arabian Am. Oil Co., 892 F.2d 1271,\n\n1274 (5th Cir. 1990) (en banc), aff'd sub nom. E.E.O.C. v. Arabian\n\n\n                                           -38-\n\fAm. Oil Co., 499 U.S. 244 (1991).    For the reasons stated above, we\n\nsee no indication that Congress entered into any such balancing.\n\nTo the contrary, it made no reference to application abroad and\n\ntailored the relevant statute to purely domestic application.     We\n\nhold that 18 U.S.C. § 1514A does not reflect the necessary clear\n\nexpression of congressional intent to extend its reach beyond our\n\nnation's borders.17    We hold, therefore, that the district court\n\nproperly dismissed Carnero's complaint under 18 U.S.C. § 1514A.\n\n                      III.   The State Law Claims\n\n          We turn next to the dismissal of Carnero's claims under\n\nMassachusetts law for, among other things, breach of contract and\n\nretaliatory termination. The district court based the dismissal on\n\ntwo factual findings:        (1) Carnero \"had no contact with the\n\ndefendant in Massachusetts,\" and (2) \"defendant [did not] in any\n\nway direct or control plaintiff [in his employment].\" Carnero, No.\n\n03-11479-RWZ (D. Mass.) (Mar. 25, 2004 endorsed order).\n\n          Carnero argues that these findings are not supported by\n\nthe record.   We need not decide the correctness of these findings,\n\nhowever, because we agree with BSC that we may affirm the district\n\n\n\n     17\n      We decide this case necessarily on its own facts. One can\nimagine many other fact patterns that may or may not be covered by\nour reasoning in today's decision. We do not, for example, decide\ntoday whether Congress intended to cover an employee based in the\nUnited States who is retaliated against for whistleblowing while on\na temporary assignment overseas. That issue is not before us as\nCarnero was a resident of Argentina and Brazil directly employed by\nforeign companies operating in those countries.\n\n                                  -39-\n\fcourt's judgment based on an alternative ground presented below in\n\nBSC's motion to dismiss the complaint: that BSA is an indispensable\n\nparty under Fed. R. Civ. P. 19 and could not be joined without\n\ndestroying the court's diversity jurisdiction.        See Gabriel v.\n\nPreble, 396 F.3d 10, 12 (1st Cir. 2005) (noting that appellate\n\ncourt may affirm order of dismissal on any ground fairly presented\n\nby the record); see also Am. Fiber & Finishing, Inc. v. Tyco\n\nHealthcare Group, LP, 362 F.3d 136, 138-39 (1st Cir. 2004) (noting\n\nthat challenge to federal subject matter jurisdiction may be\n\nconsidered for the first time on appeal).\n\n          Even assuming that BSC played a significant role in\n\nCarnero's employment, it is clear from Carnero's complaint that\n\nCarnero worked for BSA, was paid by BSA, complained about alleged\n\nbilling irregularities at BSA, was terminated from BSA, and seeks\n\nto be reinstated at BSA.   BSA is obviously needed for a full and\n\njust adjudication of this dispute, and could not be joined without\n\ndestroying the court's diversity jurisdiction because BSA and\n\nCarnero are both Argentinian citizens.   See, e.g., H.D. Corp. of\n\nP.R. v. Ford Motor Co., 791 F.2d 987, 993 (1st Cir. 1986) (reciting\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 19(b) factors and affirming dismissal of action\n\nwhere non-diverse parent company was indispensable party in part\n\nbecause it was signatory to agreements at issue).18\n\n\n     18\n      Carnero does not present any argument on appeal as to why BSA\nshould not be treated as an indispensable party. He merely argues\nthat we should reverse and remand the state law action to the\n\n                               -40-\n\f          For the foregoing reasons, the judgments of the district\n\ncourt are affirmed.\n\n          So Ordered.\n\n\n\n\ndistrict court for further factual findings.         No additional\nfindings are required, though, given the nature of Carnero's\nrelationship with BSA as alleged in his complaint. And, although\nCarnero includes a brief reference in his reply brief to an\nargument he raised below regarding BSA's necessity as a party, we\nfind that argument waived, see Hoult v. Hoult, 373 F.3d 47, 53 (1st\nCir. 2004) (noting that appellant cannot raise argument for first\ntime in reply brief); United States v. Bongiorno, 106 F.3d 1027,\n1034 (1st Cir. 1997) (noting that court will not consider argument\nraised in perfunctory manner), and without merit in any event.\n\n                               -41-\n\f",

Plaintiff-appellant\n\nRuben Carnero (\"Carnero\") appeals from judgments of the United\n\nStates District Court for the District of Massachusetts dismissing\n\nhis federal and state law complaints against Boston Scientific\n\nCorporation   (\"BSC\").   Both    complaints   alleged   that   BSC   had\n\nterminated him in retaliation for \"whistleblowing\" -- for telling\n\nBSC that Latin American subsidiaries had created false invoices and\n\nhad inflated sales figures.     The district court determined that\n\nCarnero, an Argentinian citizen resident in Brazil who worked for\n\nthe two BSC subsidiaries and whose whistleblowing pertained to\n\ntheir alleged improprieties in Latin America, could not sue BSC\n\nunder the whistleblower protection provision contained in Title\n\nVIII, Section 806, of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 18 U.S.C. §\n\n1514A (2005).   In the district court's view, that provision is\n\nwithout extraterritorial effect.    The court also held that Carnero\n\ncould not pursue state law claims against BSC as he \"had no contact\n\nwith the defendant in Massachusetts\" and as defendant did not \"in\n\nany way direct or control\" his employment.          For the reasons\n\ndiscussed below, we affirm.\n\n                          I.    Background\n\n          As said, Carnero is a citizen of Argentina and currently\n\nresides in Brazil.   The defendant, BSC, is a Delaware corporation\n\nwith headquarters in Natick, Massachusetts.         BSC manufactures\n\n\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fmedical equipment and has operations in many countries throughout\n\nthe world.\n\n           In 1997, Carnero, while residing in Argentina, accepted\n\nemployment with a BSC subsidiary in Argentina, Boston Scientific\n\nArgentina S.A. (\"BSA\"), an Argentinian company.        His employment\n\nagreement, entered into in Argentina although negotiated in various\n\ncountries including the United States, provided that his place of\n\nwork was BSA's headquarters (which is in Buenos Aires), that he\n\nwould be paid in pesos, and that the employment agreement was\n\ngoverned by the laws of Argentina.       Carnero initially worked for\n\nBSA as Country Manager for Argentina and then served as the Latin\n\nAmerica   Business   Development   Director.   In   2001,   he   took    an\n\nassignment as Country Manager for a Brazilian subsidiary of BSC,\n\nBoston Scientific Do Brasil Ltda. (\"BSB\"), while still employed by\n\nBSA.   Carnero asserts that he was terminated from BSB in August\n\n2002, and from BSA in April 2003, in retaliation for reporting to\n\nsupervisors at BSC that BSC's Argentinian and Brazilian companies,\n\nas well as other foreign companies, were engaged in accounting\n\nmisconduct by, inter alia, improperly inflating sales figures.\n\n           It is undisputed that Carnero was directly employed and\n\npaid by BSC's Argentinian and Brazilian subsidiaries rather than by\n\nBSC itself.    It is also undisputed that the alleged fraudulent\n\nconduct reported by Carnero was instituted in Latin America.            But\n\nCarnero also asserts he had an overarching employment relationship\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fwith the United States parent, BSC, resulting from the extensive\n\nand continuous control BSC's own Massachusetts employees allegedly\n\nexercised over his work and duties in Latin America.             He says that\n\nhe     maintained     contact   with    BSC,   traveling       frequently   to\n\nMassachusetts to meet with supervisors there.              Carnero does not\n\ndispute, however, that his employment duties were mainly performed\n\noutside of the United States, nor that his immediate employers were\n\nthe two foreign subsidiaries.\n\n            In      April   2003,   Carnero    pursued     a    \"conciliation\n\nproceeding\" in Argentina, a prerequisite to filing suit in an\n\nArgentinian court for statutory termination benefits from BSC and\n\nBSA.    Argentinian employees terminated without cause are entitled\n\nto such benefits. An Argentinian mediator held a hearing with BSC,\n\nBSA and Carnero, but a settlement could not be reached.               On June\n\n20, 2003, BSC and BSA brought their own claims in the Argentinian\n\ncourt, alleging, inter alia, defamation based on Carnero's claims\n\nof billing irregularities. On June 23, 2003, the Argentinian court\n\ndenied a preliminary injunction, finding that Carnero's claims of\n\n\"operating irregularities\" had not been shown to be false or\n\npublicized to third parties.        The Argentinian action appears to be\n\nongoing.\n\n            On July 2, 2003, Carnero filed a complaint against BSC\n\nwith the United States Department of Labor (\"DOL\") pursuant to the\n\nwhistleblower protection provision contained in Title VIII, Section\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f806, of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 18 U.S.C. § 1514A(b)(1)(A)\n\n(providing for filing of complaint with the United States Secretary\n\nof Labor).1   On August 8, 2003, Carnero filed a complaint against\n\nBSC in the United States District Court for the District of\n\nMassachusetts based on diversity of citizenship under 28 U.S.C. §\n\n1332(a)(2)    (1993    &     Supp.   2005),      asserting   state   law   claims,\n\nincluding breach of contract and retaliatory termination.\n\n            On December 19, 2003, the DOL issued a preliminary\n\ndecision dismissing Carnero's Sarbanes-Oxley whistleblower claim.\n\nThe   DOL   found     that    BSC    was    covered    by    the   Sarbanes-Oxley\n\nwhistleblower provision because it is a publicly traded company on\n\nthe New York Stock Exchange.               The DOL ruled, however, that the\n\nwhistleblower protection provision of the Act did not apply to\n\nemployees of covered companies working outside of the United\n\nStates.     Carnero v.

On March 25, 2004,\n\nthe district court dismissed Carnero's state law claims, finding\n\nthat Carnero \"had no contact with the defendant in Massachusetts\"\n\nand that defendant did not \"in any way direct or control\" his\n\nemployment.

The DOL, acting\n\nthrough its agency, OSHA, rejected this in a preliminary report, on\n\nthe ground that the whistleblower protection statute did not\n\nprotect employees of covered companies working outside of the\n\nUnited States.    Carnero v. Boston Scientific Corp., 2004-SOX-22\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f(OSHA Reg' Adm'r) (Dec. 19, 2003), supra.              No final agency report\n\nhaving issued within 180 days, Carnero brought a similar complaint\n\nagainst BSC in the United States District Court for the District of\n\nMassachusetts, seeking, under the provisions of the statute, de\n\nnovo judicial review of his whistleblower claim.                See 18 U.S.C. §\n\n1514A(b)(1)(B).       In its dismissal of that action, the district\n\ncourt echoed OSHA's prior view that the whistleblower protection\n\nprovision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act does not apply outside of the\n\nUnited States.     See supra.\n\n             A. Whether Carnero's Claim -- Apart from the Question of\n             Extraterritoriality -- Fits otherwise within the Terms of\n             the Whistleblower Protection Provision\n\n\n             Before     proceeding      to    ask     whether        the      instant\n\nwhistleblower protection provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was\n\nmeant   by   Congress    to   provide    extraterritorial           relief,    it   is\n\nsensible to ask whether Carnero's claim is of the kind that would,\n\nif arising domestically, fit within that provision's language.                      If\n\nnot, little need would exist to explore the extraterritorial issue.\n\nWe conclude as an initial matter, without deciding finally, that\n\nCarnero's     claim     would    --     putting       aside     the        issue    of\n\nextraterritoriality      --   fit    generally      within    the    whistleblower\n\nprotection provision of 18 U.S.C. § 1514A.\n\n             The whistleblower protection provision codified in 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1514A is a relatively small part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\n\nwhich is composed of many separate statutes and statutory schemes\n\n                                        -8-\n\faimed at achieving the Act's investor-protection goals.                     The\n\ninstant whistleblower protection statute creates an administrative\n\ncomplaint procedure and, ultimately a federal civil cause of\n\naction, designed to protect the \"employees of publicly traded\n\ncompanies\" who lawfully \"provide information . . . or otherwise\n\nassist in an investigation regarding any conduct which the employee\n\nbelieves constitutes a violation\" of the federal mail, wire, bank,\n\nor   securities    fraud   statutes,    any   rule   or   regulation   of   the\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), or other provision of\n\nthe Federal law relating to fraud against the shareholders.                 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1514A(a).3\n\n\n      3\n          18 U.S.C. § 1514A(a) provides:\n\n           Whistleblower protection for employees of publicly\n           traded companies.--No company with a class of\n           securities registered under section 12 of the\n           Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. § 78l), or\n           that is required to file reports under section 15(d)\n           of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. §\n           78o(d)), or any officer, employee, contractor,\n           subcontractor, or agent of such company, may\n           discharge, demote, suspend, threaten, harass, or in\n           any other manner discriminate against an employee in\n           the terms and conditions of employment because of any\n           lawful act done by the employee--\n\n           (1) to provide information, cause information to be\n           provided, or otherwise assist in an investigation\n           regarding any conduct which the employee reasonably\n           believes constitutes a violation of section 1341,\n           1343, 1344, or 1348, any rule or regulation of the\n           Securities and Exchange Commission, or any provision\n           of Federal law relating to fraud against shareholders\n           . . . ; or\n\n           (2) to file, cause to be filed, testify, participate\n\n                                       -9-\n\f            An individual complaining under this section of the Act\n\nmust, therefore, ordinarily be -- as Carnero alleges he is -- an\n\n\"employee\" of a publicly traded company subject to the Act.           Id.4\n\nBSC is a publicly traded company listed on the New York Stock\n\nExchange although its two foreign subsidiaries, BSA and BSB, for\n\nwhich Carnero directly worked, are not.           Companies subject to the\n\nAct are those \"with a class of securities registered under section\n\n12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. § 78l)\" or\n\n\"required to file reports under section 15(d) of the Securities\n\nExchange   Act    of   1934   (15    U.S.C.   §   78o(d)).\"   Id.

Id. § 1514A(b)(1).\n     5\n      15 U.S.C. § 78l(g)(3) (1997) allows the SEC to exempt from\nthat subsection \"any security of a foreign issuer . . . if the\nCommission finds that such exemption is in the public interest and\nis consistent with the protection of investors.\" Also, 15 U.S.C.\n§ 78o(d) (1997) provides that \"[n]othing in this subsection shall\napply to securities issued by a foreign government or political\n\n                                      -10-\n\finternatl/geographic.htm (listing more than one thousand foreign\n\ncompanies registered and reporting with the SEC as of Dec. 31,\n\n2003).\n\n            As noted, Carnero was directly in the employ of BSC's\n\nforeign subsidiaries, BSA and BSB, not themselves listed foreign\n\ncompanies.      He    claims,    however,   that    supervision     by   U.S.\n\nheadquarters personnel of the parent made him an employee of BSC\n\nalso.    Moreover, apart from that, the fact that he was employed by\n\nBSC's subsidiaries may be enough to make him a BSC \"employee\" for\n\npurposes of seeking relief under the whistleblower statute.               The\n\nDOL regulations pertaining to the whistleblower provision of the\n\nSarbanes-Oxley Act define \"employee\" as someone \"presently or\n\nformerly    working   for   a   [publicly-traded]    company   or    company\n\nrepresentative\" (emphasis supplied). The latter term is defined as\n\nincluding a \"contractor . . . or agent of a company.\"                See 29\n\nC.F.R. § 1980.101 (2005).        If BSA and BSB were agents of BSC, as\n\nseems quite possible, their own employee would fit this definition\n\nof the parent's \"employee.\" Hence Carnero, by virtue either of his\n\nown asserted contacts with BSC or his direct employment by its\n\nsubsidiaries, or both, may well be an \"employee\" of BSC for\n\npurposes of 18 U.S.C. § 1514A.        Neither party, indeed, contests\n\nthat Carnero was a covered employee of BSC for purposes of seeking\n\nwhistleblower relief under Sarbanes-Oxley.          See Collins v. Beazer\n\n\nsubdivision thereof.\"\n\n                                    -11-\n\fHomes USA, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2520602\"><a href=\"/opinion/2520602/collins-v-beazer-homes-usa-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">334</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Ga. 2004)\n\n(holding that employee of subsidiary is covered \"employee\" within\n\nmeaning of 18 U.S.C. § 1514A where officers of publicly traded\n\nparent company have authority to affect employment of subsidiary's\n\nemployees); Morefield v. Exelon Servs., Inc., 2002-SOX-2 (ALJ)\n\n(Jan. 28, 2004) (holding that \"subsidiaries, for Sarbanes-Oxley\n\npurposes, are more than mere agents like an outside auditor or\n\nconsultant . . . [they] are an integral part of the publicly traded\n\ncompany\").    We shall, therefore, assume for present purposes, but\n\nwithout deciding, that Carnero was a covered employee of BSC.               We\n\nshall also assume, for purposes of this appeal, again without\n\ndeciding, that there is evidence that Carnero's employment was\n\nterminated in retaliation for conduct protected against by 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1514A.\n\n            The whistleblower statute also makes clear that the\n\nmisconduct it protects against is not only that of the publicly\n\ntraded company itself, but also that of \"any officer, employee,\n\ncontractor,       subcontractor,   or     agent    of   such   company,\"    who\n\nretaliates or otherwise discriminates against the whistleblowing\n\nemployee.    See 18 U.S.C. § 1514A(a).        Thus, the statute can be read\n\nto embrace an agent-subsidiary's retaliation against a protected\n\nemployee.     As Carnero may be an \"employee\" of BSC, supra, his\n\nalleged retaliatory discharge by its subsidiaries for reasons\n\nforbidden    in    the   Act   could    (putting   aside   any   question    of\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fextraterritorial        application)       violate     the    terms    of     the\n\nwhistleblower protection provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n\n             We conclude, therefore, that if Carnero's whistleblowing\n\nhad occurred in this country relative to similar alleged domestic\n\nmisconduct by domestic subsidiaries, he might well have a potential\n\nclaim under the whistleblower protection provision of the Sarbanes-\n\nOxley Act.    This being so, we proceed to the next question, whether\n\nthe whistleblower provision of the Act has extraterritorial effect,\n\nso that a foreign employee such as Carnero who complains of\n\nmisconduct abroad by overseas subsidiaries, may bring suit under\n\nthe whistleblower provision of Sarbanes-Oxley against the listed\n\nUnited States parent company.          We think not.\n\n             B.   The Presumption Against Extraterritorial Application\n\n\n             Carnero argues that the whistleblower protection statute,\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1514A, should be given extraterritorial effect, so as\n\nto allow him to pursue in federal court his whistleblower claim\n\nbrought under its provisions.           He says his claim not only fits\n\nwithin the literal language of the statute, supra, but that to\n\nlimit the operation of the statute to purely domestic conduct in\n\nthe United States would improperly insulate the foreign operations\n\nof covered companies.         This, he says, would frustrate the basic\n\npurpose of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of which the whistleblower\n\nprotection    statute    at   issue   is   a   part,   to    protect   both   the\n\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\finvestors in U.S. securities markets and the integrity of those\n\nmarkets.\n\n            While Carnero's argument has some force, it faces a high\n\nand   we   think     insurmountable         hurdle        in    the   well-established\n\npresumption        against        the     extraterritorial            application     of\n\nCongressional statutes.           Where, as here, a statute is silent as to\n\nits territorial reach, and no contrary congressional intent clearly\n\nappears,     there        is     generally       a     presumption       against     its\n\nextraterritorial application.

Not\n\nonly is the text of 18 U.S.C. § 1514A silent as to any intent to\n\napply it abroad, the statute's legislative history indicates that\n\nCongress gave no consideration to either the possibility or the\n\nproblems of overseas application.           In sharp contrast with this\n\nsilence, Congress has provided expressly elsewhere in the Sarbanes-\n\nOxley   Act     for   extraterritorial     enforcement    of    a     different,\n\ncriminal,     whistleblower   statute.       By   so   providing,       Congress\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fdemonstrated that it was well able to call for extraterritorial\n\napplication when it so desired.               Also in the Act, Congress has\n\nprovided expressly for the exterritorial application of certain\n\nother unrelated statutes, tailoring these so as to cope with\n\nproblems   of    sovereignty     and   the     like   --    again   demonstrating\n\nCongress's ability to provide for foreign application when it\n\nwished. Here, however, while placing the whistleblower provision's\n\nenforcement in the hands of the DOL, a domestic agency, Congress\n\nhas made no provision for possible problems arising when that\n\nagency   seeks   to   regulate    employment      relationships       in   foreign\n\nnations, nor has Congress provided the DOL with special powers and\n\nresources to conduct investigations abroad.                Furthermore, judicial\n\nvenue provisions written into the whistleblower protection statute\n\nwere made expressly applicable only to whistleblower violations\n\nwithin the United States and to complainants residing here on the\n\ndate of violation, with no corresponding basis being provided for\n\nvenue as to foreign complainants claiming violations in foreign\n\ncountries.\n\n           These factors, and more, not only fail to imply a clear\n\ncongressional intent for extraterritorial application, but indicate\n\nthat Congress never expected such application.                  We discuss them\n\nbelow.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\f             1.    Provisions and Structure of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\n\n\n             The whistleblower protection statute in 18 U.S.C. § 1514A\n\nis one part of the Corporate and Criminal Fraud Accountability Act\n\nof 2002.     It is incorporated as Title VIII, Section 806, within the\n\nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-204, 116 Stat. 745\n\n(July 30, 2002).        The Sarbanes-Oxley Act itself is a major piece of\n\nlegislation       bundling    together    a     large    number   of   diverse   and\n\nindependent statutes, all designed to improve the quality of and\n\ntransparency       in   financial   reporting       and     auditing    of   public\n\ncompanies.        The Act increases criminal penalties for securities\n\nfraud and other violations and provides for the promulgation of\n\ncodes   of    ethics    and   various     other    means    for   holding    public\n\ncompanies to higher reporting standards.\n\n             A major part of the Act is devoted to creating a new\n\nbody, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which, serving\n\nunder the Securities and Exchange Commission, will supervise and\n\nregulate the activities of public accounting firms. The latter, in\n\nturn, are made responsible for auditing public companies.                    Unlike\n\nthe present whistleblower protection provision contained in Section\n\n806, which makes no reference to foreign entities, Section 106 of\n\nthe Act deals expressly with foreign accounting firms, requiring\n\nthem to register with the Board if they audit public companies but\n\ncarving out exceptions tailored to difficulties inherent in U.S.\n\nregulation of overseas professionals.                   See 15 U.S.C. § 7216(c)\n\n                                         -19-\n\f(2005) (providing that the SEC or the Board may, as it \"determines\n\nnecessary     or   appropriate   in   the    public    interest     or   for   the\n\nprotection of investors,\" exempt a foreign public accounting firm\n\nfrom the Act).         The accounting provision reflects Congress's\n\nrecognition     that   the   application     of   domestic   U.S.    regulatory\n\nstatutes to persons abroad presents problems in addition to those\n\nof purely domestic application, and of the need to address those\n\nproblems specifically.\n\n             Besides the whistleblower statute here at issue, found in\n\nSection 806 of the Act, two other separate provisions in Sarbanes-\n\nOxley deal with whistleblower protection.              Section 301 of the Act\n\nrequires the audit committees of issuers (which include foreign\n\nissuers)6 to implement internal procedures that facilitate and\n\nencourage     \"anonymous\"     whistleblowing      by    employees    concerning\n\n\"questionable accounting or auditing matters.\"               See 15 U.S.C. §\n\n78j-1(m)(4) (2005).7         Section 301 does not, however, purport to\n\n\n     6\n      \"Issuer\" is defined in Section 2(a)(7) of the Act as \"an\nissuer (as defined in section 3 of the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c)), the securities of which are registered under\nsection 12 of that Act (15 U.S.C. 78l), or that is required to file\nreports under section 15(d) (15 U.S.C. 78o(d)), or that files or\nhas filed a registration statement that has not yet become\neffective under the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.),\nand that it has not withdrawn.\" The definition of \"issuer\" is thus\nslightly broader than the definition of companies subject to the\nwhistleblower protection provision, since it includes any company\nthat has not yet become listed on a U.S. securities exchange.\n     7\n         15 U.S.C. § 78j-1(m)(4) provides:\n\n          Complaints.--Each audit committee shall establish\n\n                                      -20-\n\fconfer enforceable rights upon employees, hence does not implicate\n\nthe foreign sovereignty and other concerns, infra, raised by a\n\nprovision like Section 806 providing for an adjudicatory process\n\nand remedies.8\n\n            The other whistleblower provision found in the Sarbanes-\n\nOxley Act, Section 1107, is significant here by way of contrast to\n\nthe instant Section 806.     Section 1107 amended 18 U.S.C. § 1513\n\n\n\n\n         procedures for--(A) the receipt, retention, and\n         treatment of complaints received by the issuer\n         regarding accounting, internal accounting controls,\n         or auditing matters; and (B) the confidential,\n         anonymous submission by employees of the issuer of\n         concerns   regarding  questionable   accounting  or\n         auditing matters.\n     8\n      Section 307 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act directs the SEC to\n\"issue rules, in the public interest and for the protection of\ninvestors, setting forth minimum standards of professional conduct\nfor attorneys appearing and practicing before the Commission in any\nway in the representation of issuers,\" including a rule requiring\nthe internal reporting \"of a material violation of securities law\nor breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by the company or\nany agent thereof.\" See 15 U.S.C. § 7245 (2005). The SEC has\napplied this internal reporting provision to domestic and foreign\nattorneys. See 17 C.F.R. § 205.2(a)(2)(ii), (c), and (j) (2005)\n(defining \"attorney\" to include \"any person who is admitted,\nlicensed, or otherwise qualified to practice law in any\njurisdiction, domestic or foreign,\" but excepting a \"non-appearing\nforeign attorney\"); see generally Implementation of Standards of\nProfessional Conduct for Attorneys, 68 Fed.

The\n\nrelevant congressional debate focused upon concern over the lack of\n\nwhistleblower protection for private corporate employees in many\n\nstates of the union.        The original version of the statute was\n\nintroduced by Senator Leahy and three cosponsors (Senators Daschle,\n\nDurbin and Harkin) on March 12, 2002, see 148 Cong. Rec. S1783-01,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2002</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">384616</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, and reported by the Committee on the Judiciary on\n\nMay 6, 2002, see S. Rep. 107-146, 2002 WL 863249.          Senator Leahy\n\nexplained that the purpose of the statute was to provide federal\n\nprotection to private corporate whistleblowers, as was already done\n\nwith government employees, in light of the \"patchwork and vagaries\n\nof current state [whistleblower protection] laws.\"           See S. Rep.\n\n107-146, at 10 (emphasis added).         Senator Leahy addressed the need\n\nto provide federal protection where state laws failed to protect\n\ncertain private corporate whistleblowers, like Sherron Watkins, an\n\nemployee at Enron Corporation in Texas.         It is pertinent to quote\n\nSenator Leahy's statements at length:\n\n              In a variety of instances when corporate\n              employees at both Enron and [Arthur] Andersen\n\n                                   -23-\n\fattempted to report or \"blow the whistle\" on\nfraud, [] they were discouraged at nearly\nevery turn. For instance, a shocking e-mail\nfrom Enron's outside lawyers to an Enron\nofficial was uncovered. This e-mail responds\nto a request for legal advice after a senior\nEnron employee, Sherron Watkins, tried to\nreport   accounting   irregularities   at  the\nhighest levels of the company in late August\n2001. The outside lawyer[] counseled Enron,\nin pertinent part, as follows: You asked that\nI include in this communication a summary of\nthe possible risks associated with discharging\n(or constructively discharging) employees who\nreport allegations of improper accounting\npractices: 1. Texas law does not currently\nprotect corporate whistleblowers. The [Texas]\nsupreme court has twice declined to create a\ncause of action for whistleblowers who are\ndischarged * * *\n\n. . . .\n\nAccording to media accounts, this was not an\nisolated example of whistleblowing associated\nwith the Enron case. . . . . These examples\nfurther expose a culture, supported by law,\nthat discourage employees from reporting\nfraudulent behavior not only to the proper\nauthorities, such as the FBI and the SEC, but\neven internally.    This \"corporate code of\nsilence\" not only hampers investigations, but\nalso   creates   a  climate   where   ongoing\nwrongdoing can occur with virtual impunity.\nThe consequences of this corporate code of\nsilence for investors in publicly traded\ncompanies, in particular, and for the stock\nmarket, in general, are serious and adverse,\nand they must be remedied.\n\n. . . .\n\nCorporate employees who report fraud are\nsubject to the patchwork and vagaries of\ncurrent state laws, although most publicly\ntraded companies do business nationwide.\nThus, a whistleblowing employee in one state\nmay be far more vulnerable to retaliation than\n\n                    -24-\n\f                a fellow employee in another state who takes\n                the    same   actions.    Unfortunately,    as\n                demonstrated   in    the   tobacco    industry\n                litigation and the Enron case, efforts to\n                quiet whistleblowers and retaliate against\n                them for being \"disloyal\" or \"litigation\n                risks\" transcend state lines. This corporate\n                culture must change, and the law can lead the\n                way.   That is why S. 2010 is supported by\n                public interest advocates, such as the\n                National Whistleblower Center, the Government\n                Accountability Project, and Taxpayers Against\n                Fraud, who have called this bill \"the single\n                most effective measure possible to prevent\n                recurrences of the Enron debacle and similar\n                threats to the nation's financial markets.\"\n\n                . . . .\n\n                The bill does not supplant or replace state\n                law, but sets a national floor for employee\n                protections in the context of publicly traded\n                companies.\n\nId. at 4-5, 10, 20.11\n\n                Other   parts   of   the    legislative   history   confirm    the\n\nlegislators' focus on problems within the United States.

We had both seen enough cases\n\n                                       -27-\n\f           where corporate employees who possessed the\n           courage to stand up and \"do the right thing\"\n           found out the hard way that there is a severe\n           penalty for breaking the \"corporate code of\n           silence.\" Indeed, in the Enron case itself we\n           discovered an e-mail from outside counsel that\n           noted that the Texas Supreme Court had twice\n           refused to find a legal protection for\n           corporate whistleblowers and that implicitly\n           gave Enron the go ahead to fire Ms. Watkins\n           for reporting accounting irregularities.\n\nId. (emphasis added).\n\n           The legislative history thus suggests that Congress was\n\nconcerned about providing whistleblower protections for corporate\n\nemployees in the various states.           Nowhere in the legislative\n\nhistory is there any indication that 18 U.S.C. § 1514A was drafted\n\nwith the purpose of extending to foreign employees working in\n\nnations   outside    of   the   United    States    the    right   to   seek\n\nadministrative and judicial civil relief under the Act.            While the\n\nlegislative history contains repeated references to the \"states,\"\n\nparticularly Texas, there are no parallel references to foreign\n\ncountries.12   See Foley Bros., 336 U.S. at 286-87 (holding that\n\nfederal Eight Hour Law did not apply overseas where legislative\n\nhistory   revealed   that   Congress     was   primarily   concerned    with\n\ndomestic employment conditions).\n\n\n     12\n      The legislative history also indicates that the whistleblower\nprotections for corporate employees were meant to closely track the\nprotections offered to airline employees under the Wendell H. Ford\nAviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (\"AIR21\"),\n49 U.S.C. § 42121 (2005). See S. Rep. 107-146, at 26. We have\nfound no indication that AIR21's whistleblower protections apply\nextraterritorially.\n\n                                  -28-\n\f          By contrast, the legislative history of certain other\n\nprovisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act shows that Congress expressly\n\nconsidered the application of those provisions to foreign entities.\n\nFor instance, Section 106, whose text as already mentioned applies\n\nto foreign public accounting firms, also has history revealing\n\nCongress's thoughts in applying that statute abroad.

Senator Sarbanes\n\nstated:\n\n          Companies that sell shares to U.S. investors,\n          and are subject to the federal securities\n          laws, can be organized and operate in any part\n          of the world. Their financial statements are\n          not necessarily audited by U.S. accounting\n          firms, and the Committee believes that there\n          should be no difference in treatment of a\n          public company's auditors under the bill\n          simply because of a particular auditor's place\n          of operation.      Otherwise, a significant\n          loophole in the protection offered U.S.\n          investors would be built into the statutory\n          system.\n\n\n          Thus, accounting firms organized under the\n          laws of countries other than the United States\n          that issue audit reports for public companies\n          subject to the U.S. securities laws are\n          covered by the bill in the same manner as\n          domestic accounting firms, subject to the\n          exemptive authority of both the [Public\n          Company Accounting Oversight] Board and the\n          SEC.\n\n\n          Section   302   of   the   Act   provides   that   a   company's\n\nprincipal executive officers and principal financial officers, or\n\npersons performing similar functions, must certify the material\n\n\n                                 -29-\n\fcompleteness and accuracy of SEC filings.

Senator\n\nGraham stated:\n\n          If companies are being publically traded in\n          the United States, regardless of where their\n          headquarters are located, they ought to be\n          required   to   meet   the  same   level  of\n          accountability that we are establishing for\n          everyone else in this legislation.\n\n\n          Other parts of the legislative history reveal Congress's\n\nsensitivity to the application of some of the Act's provisions to\n\nforeign entities.   Some members of Congress, for instance, were\n\nreluctant to impose U.S. corporate reforms on countries with\n\nadequate or superior corporate governance regimes.         See 148 Cong.\n\nRec.

Senator\n\nEnzi commented:\n\n          I believe we need to be clear with respect to\n          the area of foreign issuers and their coverage\n          under the bill's broad definitions.      While\n          foreign issuers can be listed and traded in\n          the U.S. if they agree to conform to GAAP and\n          New York Stock Exchange rules, the SEC\n          historically has permitted the home country of\n          the issuer to implement corporate governance\n          standards.   Foreign issuers are not part of\n          the current problems being seen in the U.S.\n          capital markets, and I do not believe it was\n          the intent of the conferees to export U.S.\n          standards disregarding the sovereignty of\n          other    countries    as   well    as    their\n\n                                  -30-\n\f           regulators. . . . Under the conference report,\n           section 3(a) [which was enacted] gives the SEC\n           wide   authority    to   enact    implementing\n           regulations that are \"necessary or appropriate\n           in the public interest.\" I believe it is the\n           intent of the conferees to permit the\n           Commission wide latitude in using their\n           rulemaking authority to deal with technical\n           matters such as the scope of the definitions\n           and their applicability to foreign issuers.\n\n\n           The foregoing show Congress's keen awareness of the\n\napplication     of   some   of   the   Sarbanes-Oxley         Act   provisions   to\n\nentities   in   other      countries   and    of   the   associated      problems.\n\nAccordingly, Congress's complete silence as to overseas application\n\nof the instant whistleblower protection provision (combined with\n\nCongress's repeated reference to the need for that provision to\n\nsupplement state enforcement), provides significant indication that\n\nCongress   did       not    intend     18     U.S.C.     §     1514A     to   apply\n\nextraterritorially.\n\n           3.    Other Factors\n\n           Other factors lend support to the conclusion that the\n\nwhistleblower protection provision in 18 U.S.C. § 1514A was not\n\nmeant to apply extraterritorially.\n\n           a.    Problems of Extraterritorial Enforcement\n\n           If    the    whistleblower       protection       provision   is   given\n\nextraterritorial reach in a case like the present one, it would\n\nempower U.S. courts and a U.S. agency, the DOL, to delve into the\n\nemployment relationship between foreign employers and their foreign\n\n\n                                       -31-\n\femployees. Carnero, whose direct employers were two Latin American\n\ncorporations, has asked the United States district court for, among\n\nother relief, his reinstatement. The door would thus be opened for\n\nU.S. courts to examine and adjudicate relationships abroad that\n\nwould normally be handled by a foreign country's own courts and\n\ngovernment agencies pursuant to its own laws.               In enacting other\n\nlaws   that   affect   employment    relationships         extraterritorially,\n\nmembers of Congress have recognized \"the well-established principle\n\nof sovereignty . . . that no nation has the right to impose its\n\nlabor standards on another country.\"            See S. Rep. 98-467, at 27-28\n\n(1984), reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2974, 3000-01 (limiting age\n\ndiscrimination    law's   extraterritorial         reach    to   U.S.   citizens\n\nemployed by U.S. corporations or their subsidiaries in countries\n\nthat do not have inconsistent laws); see also Foley Bros., 336 U.S.\n\nat 578 (noting that \"labor conditions [of its own citizens] are the\n\nprimary concern of a foreign country\"). We believe if Congress had\n\nintended that the whistleblower provision would apply abroad to\n\nforeign entities, it would have said so, and certainly would have\n\nconsidered, before enacting the law, the problems and limits of\n\nextraterritorial enforcement.            Yet Congress did not at any time\n\ndiscuss the interest other countries would have in regulating these\n\nemployment    relationships,       nor    did    Congress    include     in   the\n\nwhistleblower    provision   any    mechanism      for   resolving      potential\n\nconflicts with foreign labor laws and procedures.                    Congress's\n\n\n                                     -32-\n\fcomplete silence suggests that it had no thought or intention to\n\napply this provision to foreign employees and entities as now\n\nproposed.\n\n                Further suggestive of Congress's lack of extraterritorial\n\nintent is its failure to provide any mechanism for enforcing the\n\nwhistleblower protections in a foreign setting.                       Congress did not\n\ngrant,         or    even     discuss       the   granting    of,     extraterritorial\n\ninvestigatory powers to the Department of Labor, the agency charged\n\nwith administering whistleblower complaints.13 See Aramco, 499 U.S.\n\nat   256       (concluding      that       Congress's    restrictive       intent   as    to\n\ngeographic           reach    of     Title    VII     was   evidenced       by   lack     of\n\nextraterritorial             venue     and    other     enforcement        mechanisms     in\n\nstatute).           No reference is made to providing for interpreters, for\n\ncoordinating with the Department of State, or for the utilization\n\nof foreign personnel.               Significantly, the DOL is given only sixty\n\ndays to complete its entire investigation of a complaint and to\n\nissue        findings       under    the    procedure    mandated     by    49   U.S.C.    §\n\n42121(b)(2)(A).14            See 18 U.S.C. § 1514A(b)(2).             This short time\n\n\n      13\n      The DOL has been charged with administering whistleblower\ncomplaints in a variety of employment contexts, even where another\nagency, having the technical expertise in the subject area of the\ncomplaints (such as the SEC here), has overall control.

There is no provision either for\n\nthe resources or the flexibility that might be needed in dealing\n\nwith    foreign      matters;   and,   as    said,    the   legislative     history\n\ncontains no discussion of this or other problems likely to arise\n\nhad Congress meant this provision to apply outside the territorial\n\nUnited States.         The statute, it must be remembered, protects a\n\nwhistleblowing employee from retaliation or other discrimination by\n\na publicly traded company, or \"any officer, employee, contractor,\n\n\n\n            Not later than 60 days after the date of receipt of\n            a complaint filed under paragraph (1) and after\n            affording the person named in the complaint an\n            opportunity to submit to the Secretary of Labor a\n            written response to the complaint and an opportunity\n            to meet with a representative of the Secretary to\n            present statements from witnesses, the Secretary of\n            Labor shall conduct an investigation and determine\n            whether there is reasonable cause to believe that the\n            complaint has merit and notify, in writing, the\n            complainant and the person alleged to have committed\n            a violation of subsection (a) of the Secretary's\n            findings.\n       15\n      While other whistleblower protection statutes provide for a\nsixty-day investigation time frame, see Procedures for the Handling\nof Discrimination Complaints Under Section 806 of the Corporate and\nCriminal Fraud Accountability Act of 2002, Title VIII of the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 69 Fed.

If the\n\nstatute has extraterritorial effect, this broad coverage would\n\ncreate an expansive class of potential whistleblowers by extending\n\nits protections to countless employees in countless areas around\n\nthe world.     And yet, there is no discussion about the increased\n\nadministrative and logistical burdens that would fall on the DOL to\n\nadminister such a far-reaching statute.            These omissions are\n\nstriking.     They indicate that Congress did not focus on the\n\npossibility of extraterritorial application, with its attendant\n\nproblems.\n\n            b. The Venue Provisions Contemplate Domestic Claims Only\n\n            The whistleblower provision in question includes venue\n\nprovisions instructing as to the particular federal court within\n\nwhich judicial claims are to be brought.            There is no venue\n\nprovision specifically tailored to claims based on conduct abroad,\n\nand, significantly, two of the venue provisions for various stages\n\nof court review would exclude foreign claims of the instant sort.\n\n            For whistleblower complaints brought under 18 U.S.C. §\n\n1514A, the Act incorporates by reference the procedural structure\n\nfor   whistleblower   complaints    filed   with   the   United   States\n\nDepartment of Labor under the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment\n\nand Reform Act for the 21st Century (\"AIR21\"), 49 U.S.C. § 42121\n\n(2005).     Id. § 1514A(b)(2)(A) (\"An action under paragraph (1)(A)\n\nshall be governed under the rules and procedures set forth in\n\n\n                                   -35-\n\fsection 42121(b) of title                 49 United States Code.\").16             AIR21\n\ncontains nothing prescribing a federal venue for whistleblower\n\ncomplaints or appeals based on conduct abroad, brought by employees\n\nresident and working in a foreign country.                     While de novo review,\n\nsuch as in this case, may be sought \"in the appropriate district\n\ncourt        of   the    United      States,\"   the    \"appropriate     court\"   is   not\n\ndefined, 18 U.S.C. § 1514A(b)(1)(B).                   49 U.S.C. § 42121(b)(6) and\n\nrelated provisions suggest that the appropriate court is one in the\n\njurisdiction of which the whistleblower violation occurred or the\n\ncomplainant resided.                 Hence 49 U.S.C. § 42121(b)(4)(A) provides\n\nthat appeal from the Secretary's final order should be directed to\n\nthe   federal           court   of    appeals   \"for    the   circuit   in   which    the\n\nviolation, with respect to which the order was issued, allegedly\n\n\n        16\n      The \"Whistleblower Protection Program\" under AIR21 provides\nfor: (1) the filing of a complaint with the Secretary of Labor\nalleging   retaliatory   discharge   or  discrimination;   (2)   an\nopportunity for the person named in the complaint to submit a\nwritten response and meet with a representative of the Secretary to\npresent witness statements; (3) an investigation by the Secretary\ninto the merits of the complaint; (4) a preliminary order by the\nSecretary providing relief, including reinstatement, if there is\nreasonable cause to believe a violation occurred, (5) the\nopportunity to file objections and request a hearing; (6) a final\norder by the Secretary providing relief or denying the complaint;\n(7) appellate court review of the Secretary's final order; and (8)\nenforcement of the final order in the federal district court by the\nSecretary or parties. See 49 U.S.C. § 42121(b).\n     The DOL regulations implementing AIR21 and Sarbanes-Oxley\nwhistleblower protection provisions provide for the receipt and\ninvestigation of complaints by OSHA, hearings by the Office of\nAdministrative Law Judges, and appeals of ALJ decisions by the\nAdministrative Review Board (all acting on behalf of the Secretary\nof Labor).     See 29 C.F.R. pt. 1980 (2005) (Sarbanes-Oxley\nRegulations); 29 C.F.R. pt. 1979 (2005) (AIR21 Regulations).\n\n                                            -36-\n\foccurred or the circuit in which the complainant resided on the\n\ndate of such violation.\"      Section 42121(b)(5) provides that the\n\nSecretary may enforce a final order by filing a civil action \"in\n\nthe United States district court for the district in which the\n\nviolation was found to occur.\"        Even if the \"appropriate court\"\n\nlanguage is broadly construed to allow venue at a stage like the\n\npresent, the above restrictive venue provisions would deny venue at\n\nother key stages of proceedings instituted by a foreign employee.\n\nFor Congress to have deliberately created such a discrepancy would\n\nseem highly improbable.     It is more likely Congress simply did not\n\ncontemplate the filing of administrative complaints by foreign\n\nemployees working abroad, and hence enacted no comprehensive set of\n\nvenue provisions suited to that eventuality.\n\n          c.   The Department of Labor's Preliminary Rulings\n\n          The DOL has not issued any policy statement on the\n\ngeographic reach of the whistleblower protection statute.        Indeed,\n\nthe DOL has declined to make a statement of policy.        When asked by\n\ncommentators prior to the promulgation of its final regulations to\n\nexclude from the statute's coverage employees working outside of\n\nthe United States, the DOL replied:       \"The purpose of this rule is\n\nto   provide   procedures    for    the   handling   of   Sarbanes-Oxley\n\ndiscrimination complaints; this rule is not intended to provide\n\nstatutory interpretations.\"        See Sarbanes-Oxley Regulations, 69\n\nFed.

No Clear Expression of Congressional Intent\n\n            Whether to confer extraterritorial effect is a policy\n\nchoice    for    Congress.        Our    role      is   limited    to   ascertaining\n\nCongress's intent.            \"In essence, [the foreign claimant such as\n\nCarnero] asks this court to conclude that Congress balanced [the\n\nprovision's]      important      goals     against      the   foreign    sovereignty\n\nconcerns that underlie the presumption against extraterritoriality,\n\nconsidered       the    implications       of     application     abroad   and   then\n\naddressed these concerns by inviting courts to read between the\n\nlines.\"    Boureslan v.

For the reasons stated above, we\n\nsee no indication that Congress entered into any such balancing.\n\nTo the contrary, it made no reference to application abroad and\n\ntailored the relevant statute to purely domestic application.     We\n\nhold that 18 U.S.C. § 1514A does not reflect the necessary clear\n\nexpression of congressional intent to extend its reach beyond our\n\nnation's borders.17    We hold, therefore, that the district court\n\nproperly dismissed Carnero's complaint under 18 U.S.C. § 1514A.\n\n                      III.   The State Law Claims\n\n          We turn next to the dismissal of Carnero's claims under\n\nMassachusetts law for, among other things, breach of contract and\n\nretaliatory termination. The district court based the dismissal on\n\ntwo factual findings:        (1) Carnero \"had no contact with the\n\ndefendant in Massachusetts,\" and (2) \"defendant [did not] in any\n\nway direct or control plaintiff [in his employment].\" Carnero, No.\n\n03-11479-RWZ (D. Mass.) (Mar. 25, 2004 endorsed order).\n\n          Carnero argues that these findings are not supported by\n\nthe record.   We need not decide the correctness of these findings,\n\nhowever, because we agree with BSC that we may affirm the district\n\n\n\n     17\n      We decide this case necessarily on its own facts. One can\nimagine many other fact patterns that may or may not be covered by\nour reasoning in today's decision. We do not, for example, decide\ntoday whether Congress intended to cover an employee based in the\nUnited States who is retaliated against for whistleblowing while on\na temporary assignment overseas. That issue is not before us as\nCarnero was a resident of Argentina and Brazil directly employed by\nforeign companies operating in those countries.\n\n                                  -39-\n\fcourt's judgment based on an alternative ground presented below in\n\nBSC's motion to dismiss the complaint: that BSA is an indispensable\n\nparty under Fed.

BSA is obviously needed for a full and\n\njust adjudication of this dispute, and could not be joined without\n\ndestroying the court's diversity jurisdiction because BSA and\n\nCarnero are both Argentinian citizens.
