App. P. 43(c)(2), Attorney General\nEric H. Holder, Jr. has been substituted for former Attorney\nGeneral Michael B. Mukasey as the respondent.\n\f           LYNCH, Chief Judge. Rebecca Matovu, a native and citizen\n\nof   Uganda,   seeks    review   of   a    final   order   of   the    Board    of\n\nImmigration Appeals (\"BIA\") denying her application for asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against\n\nTorture (\"CAT\").       We deny Matovu's petition.\n\n                                      I.\n\n           Matovu entered the United States as a visitor on July 24,\n\n1997, petitioned for F-1 student status, and obtained authorization\n\nto remain in the United States until October 1, 2002.                 On October\n\n7, 2002, Matovu filed an application for asylum.           On July 26, 2004,\n\nthe Department of Homeland Security denied her request and referred\n\nher application to an Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") to initiate removal\n\nproceedings.     Matovu conceded removability and sought asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and protection under the CAT.                    In the\n\nalternative, Matovu requested voluntary departure.\n\n           Matovu testified in support of her application in two\n\nseparate hearings on August 22, 2005 and March 29, 2006.                       She\n\nclaimed that her father had been killed in 1982, during Uganda's\n\ncivil war, by rebels now in control of the Ugandan government.\n\nFollowing her father's death, Matovu relocated with her brother to\n\nNairobi, Kenya, where she resided until returning to Uganda in\n\n1989.   Between 1994 and 1997, she visited Kenya multiple times, as\n\nwell as India and Tanzania, always returning to Uganda.                In 1997,\n\nMatovu left Uganda and traveled to the United States.                   Her two\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fchildren   remained      in    Uganda   with     her    mother,      where,   Matovu\n\ntestified, they were attending government-run boarding school.\n\n           Matovu further testified that after her arrival in the\n\nUnited States the Ugandan government obtained information about her\n\nbrother's whereabouts from his briefcase, which was stolen from him\n\nwhen he visited Uganda in early 2002.                 Over the months following\n\nthe theft, secret agents approached her mother several times,\n\nseeking    additional      information        about    her   brother.          Matovu\n\nmaintained        that   these    Ugandan      government       operatives      were\n\nresponsible for the fatal shooting of her brother in May 2002 in\n\nNairobi.     She attributed the attack to the Ugandan government's\n\nfear that her brother might \"point a finger at them\" for past\n\natrocities.       Matovu added that a friend had reported that secret\n\nagents had sought information about Matovu's own whereabouts in the\n\nmonths prior to her testimony.          Finally, she expressed fear at the\n\nprospect     of    returning     to   Uganda,    in     light   of    the     Ugandan\n\ngovernment's persistent interest in her family.1\n\n           In an oral decision on March 29, 2006, the IJ held that\n\nMatovu had failed to establish eligibility for asylum.                        The IJ\n\nfirst determined that Matovu's testimony was not credible, noting\n\n\n\n     1\n          The retirement of the IJ who had presided over the first\nproceeding necessitated a complete rehearing before a second IJ.\nThe rehearing provided the basis for the BIA's opinion, and the\npetitioner has not asserted any prejudice arising from the second\nproceeding in this appeal. We limit our discussion of Matovu's\ntestimony to the hearing held on March 29, 2006.\n\n                                        -3-\n\fthat the \"whole of [her] claim . . .is marred with inconsistencies\n\nand     also    with     vague     statements.\"            The     IJ     cited      \"major\n\ndiscrepancies\" between Matovu's asylum assessment memorandum and\n\nher testimony.         The IJ noted, for instance, that Matovu had\n\npreviously       indicated       that    her     brother    had        been    killed   by\n\n\"unidentified gunmen\" as a result of his efforts \"to reclaim lost\n\nfamily property.\"         The IJ also found she had failed to produce\n\ncorroborative      evidence       with    which    to   resolve         this   and   other\n\ninconsistencies.\n\n               The IJ concluded that Matovu had failed to demonstrate\n\npast persecution in Uganda, observing in particular that, even on\n\nher own testimony, \"nothing ever happened\" to her during her years\n\nof residence in that country.\n\n               Turning to future persecution, the IJ held that Matovu\n\nhad failed to show any nexus between the deaths of her brother and\n\nher father or otherwise corroborate her claim that she was being\n\ntargeted by the Ugandan government as a result of her familial\n\nties.     The IJ emphasized Matovu's repeated travel to and from\n\nUganda in the years following her father's death, as well as her\n\nchildren's attendance at a government-run school, as additional\n\nevidence that she had no cause to fear future persecution.\n\n               The IJ further held that the failure of Matovu's asylum\n\nclaim    meant    that    she     could    not    satisfy        the    more    stringent\n\nrequirements for withholding of removal.                The IJ also rejected her\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fapplication for CAT relief, citing the application's lack of any\n\nsupporting evidence.          Finally, the IJ granted Matovu voluntary\n\ndeparture.\n\n            The BIA dismissed Matovu's appeal in an opinion issued on\n\nSeptember 30, 2008.          It agreed with the IJ's determination that\n\nMatovu did not suffer past persecution in Uganda and further agreed\n\n\"that there is simply no credible evidence that secret agents seek\n\nto persecute [Matovu] upon her return to Uganda as a result of her\n\nfamilial ties.\"\n\n            The BIA noted that the IJ had erred in failing to\n\nrecognize evidence corroborating Matovu's brother's murder, and in\n\nplacing too great an emphasis on Matovu's failure to produce\n\ncorroborative documents that could not be reasonably obtained.\n\nThe BIA deemed these errors harmless.            The BIA found that even if\n\nMatovu's testimony were accepted as true, and the overlooked\n\nevidence   regarded     as    establishing   that   her   brother    had   been\n\nmurdered, she still would not have \"demonstrate[d] a nexus between\n\nthe brother's and father's deaths, or a nexus between the deaths\n\nand [her] fear of future persecution in Uganda.\"              Without evidence\n\nof such a link, the BIA found Matovu's claim to be \"speculative at\n\nbest\" and affirmed that she was statutorily ineligible for asylum.\n\n            The   BIA   also     agreed   with   the   IJ's    determinations\n\nregarding Matovu's ineligibility for withholding of removal and CAT\n\nrelief.    Accordingly, the BIA dismissed Matovu's appeal.\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f            This petition for review followed.\n\n                                 II.\n\n            We review BIA findings of fact under the substantial\n\nevidence standard. Scatambuli v. Holder, 558 F.3d 53, 58 (1st Cir.\n\n2009).   Under this deferential standard, we accept these findings\n\nso long as they are grounded in \"reasonable, substantial, and\n\nprobative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\"    Shahari\n\nv. Gonzáles, 407 F.3d 467, 473 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting INS v.\n\nElias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992)) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).   Thus, we will affirm unless \"any reasonable adjudicator\n\nwould be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\"        8 U.S.C. §\n\n1252(b)(4)(B).     When the BIA affirms the IJ's opinion but also\n\nexamines some of the bases of that decision, we review both the\n\nIJ's and the BIA's opinions.    Limani v. Mukasey, 538 F.3d 25, 30\n\n(1st Cir. 2008).\n\n            An applicant for asylum bears the burden of establishing\n\nthat he or she suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear\n\nof future persecution on the basis of \"race, religion, nationality,\n\nmembership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\"   8\n\nU.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A); see also Ratnasingam v. Holder, 556 F.3d\n\n10, 13 (1st Cir. 2009).   An applicant's fear of future persecution\n\n\"must be both genuine and objectively reasonable.\"    Aguilar-Solis\n\nv. I.N.S., 168 F.3d 565, 572 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f           Matovu does not claim past persecution; she argues that\n\nthe deaths of her father and brother give rise to reasonable fear\n\nof future persecution on the basis of membership in her nuclear\n\nfamilial   social   group.       Substantial    evidence   supports    the\n\nconclusion reached by the IJ and the BIA that Matovu does not face\n\na likelihood of future persecution on her return to Uganda.\n\n           Matovu   argues    that    the   record   compels   her    view,\n\nattributing the Ugandan government's killing of her father to his\n\n\"outspoken views on the rebel movement\" and the murder of her\n\nbrother to the risk that he might seek compensation for his\n\nfather's murder or disseminate information about past Ugandan\n\ngovernment wrongdoing.       In the end, Matovu \"presents no evidence\n\nother than [her] own speculation\" to support this link.         Khalil v.\n\nAshcroft, 337 F.3d 50, 55 (1st Cir. 2003).           The IJ and BIA were\n\n\"free to reject [her] speculation.\" Ziu v. Gonzales, 412 F.3d 202,\n\n204 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           Matovu argues that the BIA should have remanded her\n\nasylum claim to the IJ to consider evidence the IJ had overlooked\n\nabout her brother's murder.          As the BIA held, the newspaper\n\narticles and affidavit verifying her brother's death do not link\n\nhis murder to her father's death or otherwise connect either of\n\ntheir killings to Matovu's fear of future persecution. Substantial\n\nevidence likewise supports the BIA's conclusion that the letter\n\nfrom her son indicating that he is \"very scared of people coming\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\faround   to    our   house   all   the   time\"   fails   to   connect   these\n\nindividuals to the Ugandan government or establish a nexus between\n\nMatovu's brother's death and the threat of future persecution.\n\nUltimately, the denial of Matovu's claim rested on her failure to\n\nproduce evidence to support a link between her family members'\n\ndeaths and her own fear of future persecution.2          As the overlooked\n\nevidence \"would not in any way shed light on this individualized\n\nissue,\" remand is unnecessary.           Chhay v. Mukasey, 540 F.3d 1, 8\n\n(1st Cir. 2008).\n\n              Matovu makes only perfunctory arguments in support of her\n\neligibility for withholding of removal. As the BIA held, her claim\n\nthat the \"Ugandan government is slowly making [its] way through the\n\nMatovu family\" is undermined by the same absence of evidence that\n\nprevented her from meeting the less stringent standard for asylum.\n\n              As to her claim for CAT relief, there is nothing to\n\ncompel a factfinder's conclusion that Matovu would \"more likely\n\nthan not . . . be tortured if removed\" to Uganda. 8 C.F.R. §\n\n208.16(c)(2).\n\n              The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n          The record is clear that Matovu's children and her mother\ncontinue to live peaceably in Uganda, further undercutting her\nclaim of reasonable fear of persecution on the basis of familial\nassociation. Bakuaya v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 39, 41 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n                                     -8-\n\f",

Scadron, Assistant Director, Office of Immigration Litigation, on brief for the respondent.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, Chief Judge, LIPEZ and HOWARD, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>LYNCH, Chief Judge.</p>\n<p>Rebecca Matovu, a native and citizen of Uganda, seeks review of a final order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") denying her application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\"). We deny Matovu's petition.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Matovu entered the United States as a visitor on July 24, 1997, petitioned for F-1 student status, and obtained authorization to remain in the United States until October 1, 2002. On October 7, 2002, Matovu filed an application for asylum. On July 26, 2004, the Department of Homeland Security denied her request and referred her application to an Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") to initiate removal proceedings. Matovu conceded removability and sought asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT. In the alternative, Matovu requested voluntary departure.</p>\n<p>Matovu testified in support of her application in two separate hearings on August 22, 2005 and March 29, 2006. She claimed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*385</span> that her father had been killed in 1982, during Uganda's civil war, by rebels now in control of the Ugandan government. Following her father's death, Matovu relocated with her brother to Nairobi, Kenya, where she resided until returning to Uganda in 1989. Between 1994 and 1997, she visited Kenya multiple times, as well as India and Tanzania, always returning to Uganda. In 1997, Matovu left Uganda and traveled to the United States. Her two children remained in Uganda with her mother, where, Matovu testified, they were attending government-run boarding school.</p>\n<p>Matovu further testified that after her arrival in the United States the Ugandan government obtained information about her brother's whereabouts from his briefcase, which was stolen from him when he visited Uganda in early 2002. Over the months following the theft, secret agents approached her mother several times, seeking additional information about her brother. Matovu maintained that these Ugandan government operatives were responsible for the fatal shooting of her brother in May 2002 in Nairobi. She attributed the attack to the Ugandan government's fear that her brother might \"point a finger at them\" for past atrocities. Matovu added that a friend had reported that secret agents had sought information about Matovu's own whereabouts in the months prior to her testimony. Finally, she expressed fear at the prospect of returning to Uganda, in light of the Ugandan government's persistent interest in her family.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>In an oral decision on March 29, 2006, the IJ held that Matovu had failed to establish eligibility for asylum. The IJ first determined that Matovu's testimony was not credible, noting that the \"whole of [her] claim ... is marred with inconsistencies and also with vague statements.\" The IJ cited \"major discrepancies\" between Matovu's asylum assessment memorandum and her testimony. The IJ noted, for instance, that Matovu had previously indicated that her brother had been killed by \"unidentified gunmen\" as a result of his efforts \"to reclaim lost family property.\" The IJ also found she had failed to produce corroborative evidence with which to resolve this and other inconsistencies.</p>\n<p>The IJ concluded that Matovu had failed to demonstrate past persecution in Uganda, observing in particular that, even on her own testimony, \"nothing ever happened\" to her during her years of residence in that country.</p>\n<p>Turning to future persecution, the IJ held that Matovu had failed to show any nexus between the deaths of her brother and her father or otherwise corroborate her claim that she was being targeted by the Ugandan government as a result of her familial ties. The IJ emphasized Matovu's repeated travel to and from Uganda in the years following her father's death, as well as her children's attendance at a government-run school, as additional evidence that she had no cause to fear future persecution.</p>\n<p>The IJ further held that the failure of Matovu's asylum claim meant that she could not satisfy the more stringent requirements for withholding of removal. The IJ also rejected her application for CAT relief, citing the application's lack of any supporting evidence. Finally, the IJ granted Matovu voluntary departure.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*386</span> The BIA dismissed Matovu's appeal in an opinion issued on September 30, 2008. It agreed with the IJ's determination that Matovu did not suffer past persecution in Uganda and further agreed \"that there is simply no credible evidence that secret agents seek to persecute [Matovu] upon her return to Uganda as a result of her familial ties.\"</p>\n<p>The BIA noted that the IJ had erred in failing to recognize evidence corroborating Matovu's brother's murder, and in placing too great an emphasis on Matovu's failure to produce corroborative documents that could not be reasonably obtained. The BIA deemed these errors harmless. The BIA found that even if Matovu's testimony were accepted as true, and the overlooked evidence regarded as establishing that her brother had been murdered, she still would not have \"demonstrate[d] a nexus between the brother's and father's deaths, or a nexus between the deaths and [her] fear of future persecution in Uganda.\" Without evidence of such a link, the BIA found Matovu's claim to be \"speculative at best\" and affirmed that she was statutorily ineligible for asylum.</p>\n<p>The BIA also agreed with the IJ's determinations regarding Matovu's ineligibility for withholding of removal and CAT relief. Accordingly, the BIA dismissed Matovu's appeal.</p>\n<p>This petition for review followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>We review BIA findings of fact under the substantial evidence standard. <i>Scatambuli v. Holder,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1355710\"><a href=\"/opinion/1355710/scatambuli-v-holder/\"><span class=\"volume\">558</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span>, 58 (1st Cir.2009). Under this deferential standard, we accept these findings so long as they are grounded in \"reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\" <i>Sharari v. Gonzáles,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201584\"><a href=\"/opinion/201584/sharari-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span></a></span>, 473 (1st Cir.2005) (quoting <i>INS v. Elias-Zacarias,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112682\"><a href=\"/opinion/112682/ins-v-elias-zacarias/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></a></span>, 481, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112682\"><a href=\"/opinion/112682/ins-v-elias-zacarias/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">812</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112682\"><a href=\"/opinion/112682/ins-v-elias-zacarias/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span> (1992)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, we will affirm unless \"any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B). When the BIA affirms the IJ's opinion but also examines some of the bases of that decision, we review both the IJ's and the BIA's opinions. <i>Limani v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203442\"><a href=\"/opinion/203442/limani-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 30 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>An applicant for asylum bears the burden of establishing that he or she suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution on the basis of \"race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A); <i>see also </i><i>Ratnasingam v. Holder,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203665\"><a href=\"/opinion/203665/ratnasingam-v-holder/\"><span class=\"volume\">556</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, 13 (1st Cir.2009). An applicant's fear of future persecution \"must be both genuine and objectively reasonable.\" <i>Aguilar-Solis v. I.N.S.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198342\"><a href=\"/opinion/198342/aguilar-solis-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></a></span>, 572 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p>Matovu does not claim past persecution; she argues that the deaths of her father and brother give rise to reasonable fear of future persecution on the basis of membership in her nuclear familial social group. Substantial evidence supports the conclusion reached by the IJ and the BIA that Matovu does not face a likelihood of future persecution on her return to Uganda.</p>\n<p>Matovu argues that the record compels her view, attributing the Ugandan government's killing of her father to his \"outspoken views on the rebel movement\" and the murder of her brother to the risk that he might seek compensation for his father's murder or disseminate information about past Ugandan government wrongdoing. In the end, Matovu \"presents no evidence other than [her] own speculation\" to support this link. <i>Khalil v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200567\"><a href=\"/opinion/200567/khalil-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">337</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 55 (1st Cir.2003). The IJ and BIA were \"free to reject [her] speculation.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*387</span> <i>Ziu v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201619\"><a href=\"/opinion/201619/ziu-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">202</span></a></span>, 204 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>Matovu argues that the BIA should have remanded her asylum claim to the IJ to consider evidence the IJ had overlooked about her brother's murder. As the BIA held, the newspaper articles and affidavit verifying her brother's death do not link his murder to her father's death or otherwise connect either of their killings to Matovu's fear of future persecution. Substantial evidence likewise supports the BIA's conclusion that the letter from her son indicating that he is \"very scared of people coming around to our house all the time\" fails to connect these individuals to the Ugandan government or establish a nexus between Matovu's brother's death and the threat of future persecution. Ultimately, the denial of Matovu's claim rested on her failure to produce evidence to support a link between her family members' deaths and her own fear of future persecution.<sup>[2]</sup> As the overlooked evidence \"would not in any way shed light on this individualized issue,\" remand is unnecessary. <i>Chhay v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203441\"><a href=\"/opinion/203441/chhay-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>Matovu makes only perfunctory arguments in support of her eligibility for withholding of removal. As the BIA held, her claim that the \"Ugandan government is slowly making [its] way through the Matovu family\" is undermined by the same absence of evidence that prevented her from meeting the less stringent standard for asylum.</p>\n<p>As to her claim for CAT relief, there is nothing to compel a factfinder's conclusion that Matovu would \"more likely than not ... be tortured if removed\" to Uganda. 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(c)(2).</p>\n<p>The petition for review is <i>denied.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Pursuant to Fed.
