Sheridan, pro se.\n     Nancy H. Michels, with whom the Law Offices of Michels &\nMichels and Carole A. Mansur were on the brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                            March 29, 2004\n\f           CYR, Senior Circuit Judge. William C. Sheridan, Esquire,\n\nappeals from a bankruptcy court order which suspended him from the\n\npractice of law before the United States Bankruptcy Court for the\n\nDistrict of New Hampshire and directed him to remit the fees due\n\nthe special counsel appointed to investigate the various violations\n\nof the District of New Hampshire Rules of Professional Conduct for\n\nwhich Sheridan    allegedly      is   responsible.       We   now    vacate      the\n\nbankruptcy court order, and remand for further proceedings.\n\n                                       I.\n\n                                 BACKGROUND\n\n           In June 2000, the bankruptcy judge appointed Attorney\n\nNancy   Michels   as   Special   Counsel       to   investigate     the    ethical\n\nviolations alleged against Sheridan, an attorney and member of the\n\nbankruptcy court bar.      Following an extensive investigation into\n\nSheridan’s representation of various clients between 1999 and 2000,\n\nSpecial Counsel lodged a complaint charging Sheridan with rendering\n\nincompetent   representation          in     violation   of   N.H.        Rule   of\n\nProfessional Conduct 1.1(a).\n\n           Although Sheridan, acting pro se, eventually stipulated\n\nto most of the allegations in the complaint, he contended that his\n\nconduct had been due either to a dopamine deficiency resulting in\n\nsevere attention deficit disorder or to the uncooperativeness and\n\nobstinacy of the affected clients.                  Following a disciplinary\n\nhearing in June 2001, the bankruptcy court determined that Sheridan\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fhad committed eighty-eight ethical violations, most involving the\n\nfailure to comply with such basic requirements as the timely filing\n\nof chapter 13 plans and motions for continuance.\n\n           In due course, Sheridan was suspended from practice\n\nbefore the bankruptcy court for one year; readmission contingent\n\nupon satisfactory proof that he was competent to represent clients\n\nbefore the bankruptcy court.      Subsequently, the bankruptcy court\n\napproved an application for a $30,377.50 attorney fee to Special\n\nCounsel, then directed that Sheridan – as a precondition to his\n\nreadmission to the bankruptcy bar – reimburse the bankruptcy court\n\nin that amount. Sheridan then appealed to the Bankruptcy Appellate\n\nPanel   (\"BAP\"),   which   affirmed.    Sheridan   v.   Michels   (In   re\n\nDisciplinary Proceedings), 282 B.R. 79 (B.A.P. 1st Cir. 2002).\n\n                                  II.\n\n                               DISCUSSION\n\n           Sheridan contends that (i) the bankruptcy court, unlike\n\nArticle III courts, lacks either the inherent or statutory power to\n\nsuspend or discipline counsel who practice before it, see Northern\n\nPipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U.S. 50, 86-87\n\n(1982); (ii) moreover, even assuming the bankruptcy court possesses\n\nsuch disciplinary power, it cannot exercise it absent an explicit\n\nlocal court rule, but see U.S. Dist. Ct. Local Rule (D.N.H.) 83.5,\n\nand then only if the bankruptcy court were to determine that\n\ncounsel acted in “bad faith,” see Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S.\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f32, 45 (1991); (iii) Bankruptcy Code § 105 applies exclusively to\n\nsuch disciplinary proceedings against an attorney as arise in a\n\nparticular, ongoing bankruptcy case, not to the instant type of\n\nomnibus investigation into alleged attorney misconduct spanning\n\nmultiple bankruptcy cases no longer pending before the court;1 (iv)\n\nAdministrative Order 2090-2, issued by the bankruptcy court below,\n\nexplicitly authorizing such disciplinary hearings, is invalid due\n\nto the fact that it was promulgated without either advance notice\n\nor an opportunity for public comment, notwithstanding the rule-\n\nmaking provisions enunciated in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 83,\n\ncf. U.S. Dist. Ct. Local Rule (D.N.H.) 77.4(b) (“Pursuant to [Fed.\n\nR. Bankr. P] 9029, the bankruptcy judges of this district are\n\nauthorized to make such rules of practice and procedure as they may\n\ndeem appropriate, subject to the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n83.”); (v) in all events, Administrative Order 2090-2, which was\n\nnot in effect at the time the bankruptcy court initiated the\n\nSheridan investigation, cannot be applied retroactively; and (vi)\n\nthe disciplinary power wielded by the bankruptcy court in the\n\ninstant case offends the doctrine of separation of powers, in that\n\nthe   bankruptcy   court   itself    thereby   assumes   the   inherently\n\nconflicting roles of accuser, investigator, prosecutor, and judge.\n\n\n\n      1\n      Bankruptcy Code § 105(a) provides, in pertinent part: “The\ncourt may issue any order, process, or judgment that is necessary\nor appropriate to carry out the provisions of this title.” 11\nU.S.C. § 105(a).\n\n                                    -4-\n\f            In the particular circumstances of the instant case, due\n\nto the fact that the BAP lacked appellate jurisdiction to address\n\nSheridan’s claims on the merits, the case must be remanded to the\n\nbankruptcy court for further proceedings.                We explain.\n\n            The    BAPs    are    authorized    to     review   only    the    “final\n\njudgments, orders and decrees” issued by the bankruptcy courts. 28\n\nU.S.C. § 158(b)(1), (a)(1).           Consequently, in the instant context\n\nthe dispositive jurisdictional issue is whether the disciplinary\n\norders   issued    by     the    bankruptcy    court    against      Sheridan    were\n\n“final.” See Stanley v. S.S. Retail Shoes Corp. (In re S.S. Retail\n\nShoes Corp.), 162 F.3d 1230, 1232 (9th Cir. 1998) (“In making the\n\n[jurisdictional] determination, we must focus on the nature of the\n\nbankruptcy court's order. If that decision was not a final order,\n\nthen the BAP's order also lacks finality.”).\n\n            The finality of a bankruptcy court order depends, inter\n\nalia,    upon   whether     the    proceeding    in     which   it     was    entered\n\nconstitutes a “core” or “non-core” proceeding.                        Although the\n\ndistrict court, as a tribunal established under Article III of the\n\nUnited    States    Constitution,       possesses       broad   jurisdiction       to\n\nadjudicate all proceedings which even tangentially “aris[e] under,”\n\nor are “related to,” a bankruptcy case [hereinafter: “related to”\n\nproceedings], the district court may opt to refer such cases or\n\nproceedings to the bankruptcy courts for hearing or adjudication.\n\nSee 28 U.S.C. § 157(a).          Of course, unlike the district court, the\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fbankruptcy court is established pursuant to Article I, rather than\n\nArticle      III,   and    its    jurisdiction         is    delimited      accordingly.\n\nAlthough the bankruptcy court may hear all “related-to” proceedings\n\nwhich have been referred to it, whether core or non-core, it may\n\nenter a final appealable judgment only if (i) the proceeding itself\n\nis   core,    viz.,   closely       intertwined        with       and   integral   to   the\n\nbankruptcy court’s mandate to administer a bankruptcy case; or (ii)\n\nthe case or proceeding is non-core, but the litigants nonetheless\n\nhave   consented      to    the    entry    of    a    final       disposition     by   the\n\nbankruptcy court, rather than by the district court.                        See Northern\n\nPipeline, 458 U.S. at 86-87.\n\n              If the proceeding is core, the bankruptcy court’s final\n\njudgment is immediately appealable either to the district court or,\n\nwith the      consent      of    the   parties,       to    the    BAP.     28   U.S.C.   §\n\n158(b)(1); § 157(b)(1). In either instance, the appellate tribunal\n\napplies a deferential standard of review to the bankruptcy court’s\n\nfindings of fact, and will upset those findings only if clearly\n\nerroneous.      See In re Spadoni, 316 F.3d 56, 58 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n              In a non-core proceeding, however, the bankruptcy court\n\nis not empowered to enter final, appealable orders without the\n\nparties’ consent.          Instead, after it has conducted the required\n\nproceedings, it must submit its proposed findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law for consideration by the district court. See 28\n\nU.S.C. § 157(c)(1); Cong. Credit Corp. v. AJC Int’l, Inc., 42 F.3d\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\f686, 690 (1st Cir. 1994).        The role of the district court in turn\n\nis to conduct de novo review of the findings of fact and the\n\nconclusions of law submitted by the bankruptcy court. In so doing,\n\nthe   district    court   may    receive   further     evidence,    modify   the\n\nfindings proposed by the bankruptcy court, and/or remand to the\n\nbankruptcy court with instructions. See Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9033(d).\n\nAt that stage, any appeal from the “final” district court order may\n\nbe taken only to the court of appeals, which applies a deferential\n\nstandard of review.       Id. § 158(d).\n\n           In    the   instant    case,    the   BAP   did   not   address   the\n\ncore/non-core distinction in its decision, Sheridan, 282 B.R. at\n\n86-89, perhaps because Sheridan’s reference to it – included\n\namongst   other    objections,     in     his    appellate   briefs,   to    the\n\nbankruptcy court’s authority to impose sanctions – simply was not\n\nprominently advanced or distinguished. Unlike the issue of subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction, which may neither be waived nor forfeited by\n\nthe parties, see Quinn v. City of Boston, 325 F.3d 18, 26 (1st Cir.\n\n2003), and into which the courts are duty-bound to inquire, sua\n\nsponte, even absent objection by any party, see Hicks, Muse & Co.\n\nv. Brandt (In re Healthco Int'l, Inc.), 136 F.3d 45, 50 n.4 (1st\n\nCir. 1998), the protections afforded by the Northern Pipeline\n\ncore/non-core distinction may be waived or forfeited, either by (i)\n\nconsenting to the bankruptcy court's treatment of an otherwise non-\n\ncore proceeding as core, or (ii) failing to raise or pursue the\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fissue adequately on appeal.   See Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n\n\nv. Schor, 478 U.S. 833, 848-49 (1986).\n\n          Although normally the proper designation of a proceeding\n\nas either core or non-core presents a pure question of law, subject\n\nto plenary review on appeal, see In re V & M Mgmt., Inc., 321 F.3d\n\n6, 7 (1st Cir. 2003); In re Graves, 279 B.R. 266, 270 (B.A.P. 9th\n\nCir. 2002), if Sheridan failed to preserve his contention before\n\nthe bankruptcy court or on appeal, we would review for plain error\n\nonly, see Rivera-Torres v. Ortiz Velez, 341 F.3d 86, 102 (1st Cir.\n\n2003) (\"[C]laims ‘forfeit[ed] through ignorance or neglect’ are\n\nsubject to plain error review.”) (citation omitted).   We now turn\n\nto these threshold issues.\n\nA.   Consent\n\n          Before the bankruptcy court, Sheridan did not expressly\n\nconsent, either orally or in writing, to the treatment of his\n\nomnibus disciplinary proceeding as core.2   In In re G.S.F. Corp.,\n\n\n     2\n      The advisory committee note to Federal Rule of Bankruptcy\nProcedure 7008, which implements the statutory core/non-core\ndichotomy, provides:\n\n     Proceedings before a bankruptcy judge are either core or\n     non-core. 28 U.S.C. § 157. A bankruptcy judge may enter\n     a final order or judgment in a core proceeding. In a\n     non-core proceeding, absent consent of the parties, the\n     bankruptcy judge may not enter a final order or judgment\n     but may only submit proposed findings of fact and\n     conclusions of law to the district judge who will enter\n     the final order or judgment. 28 U.S.C. § 157(c)(1). The\n     amendment to subdivision (a) of this rule requires an\n     allegation as to whether a proceeding is core or\n     non-core. A party who alleges that the proceeding is\n\n                                -8-\n\f938   F.2d   1467   (1st    Cir.    1991),   we   decided   that   in   certain\n\ncircumstances, at least where the parties’ actions appear to speak\n\nas clearly as words, consent may be implied.          The actions deemed to\n\nhave evidenced “implied consent” in G.S.F. consisted of (i) the\n\nfiling of stipulations and releases by the parties “for entry as a\n\nfinal judgment” in the bankruptcy court, which stipulations and\n\nreleases     subsequently    were    incorporated    into   the    final   order\n\nwhereby the bankruptcy court dismissed the proceeding, and (ii) the\n\ndecision by the parties not to appeal from that “final” order.               Id.\n\nat 1477.     Thus, it was their affirmative and unambiguous conduct\n\nbefore the bankruptcy court – rather than their mere failure to\n\nrequest prior to judgment that the proceeding be declared non-core\n\n– which constituted the functional equivalent of the parties'\n\nexpress consent.     See infra note 5.\n\n             In contrast, Sheridan’s conduct did not unambiguously\n\nconnote consent, either to the bankruptcy court’s characterization\n\nof the proceeding as core or to its final adjudication of the\n\n\n      non-core shall state whether the party does or does not\n      consent to the entry of a final order or judgment by the\n      bankruptcy judge. Failure to include the statement of\n      consent does not constitute consent.       Only express\n      consent in the pleadings or otherwise is effective to\n      authorize entry of a final order or judgment by the\n      bankruptcy judge in a non-core proceeding. Amendments to\n      Rule 7012 require that the defendant admit or deny the\n      allegation as to whether the proceeding is core or\n      non-core.\n\nFed. R. Bankr. P. 7008 advisory committee’s note (1987) (emphasis\nadded).\n\n                                       -9-\n\fproceeding as non-core.    It is true that Sheridan did not suggest\n\nthat the proceeding was non-core until he submitted the post-\n\njudgment motion for reconsideration, cf. Santiago v. Canon U.S.A.,\n\nInc., 138 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1998) (noting that party normally may\n\nnot raise new issues in post-judgment motion for reconsideration),\n\nbut the entry of the judgment was the first procedural juncture in\n\nthe bankruptcy proceeding in relation to which the core/none-core\n\nissue was broached.       Until then, it remained unclear how the\n\nbankruptcy court viewed its own jurisdiction.\n\n          To be sure, Sheridan could have elected to place the\n\nissue in contention sooner, but the failure to do so can bear no\n\ninference of consent.     When the district court refers a “related\n\nto” proceeding to the bankruptcy court, no presumption attaches\n\nthat the proceeding is core.      Indeed, the Rules of Bankruptcy\n\nProcedure, which serve to implement the statute itself, mandate\n\nthat the complaint contain a statement or allegation regarding\n\nwhether the proceeding is core or non-core, and if the latter,\n\nwhether the plaintiff consents to the entry of a final judgment by\n\nthe bankruptcy court.       See Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7008(a).      The\n\ncomplaint filed by Special Counsel failed to place the issue in\n\ncontention by alleging that the proceeding was core.      In cases\n\nwhere the plaintiff (e.g., Special Counsel Michels) has the burden\n\nto plead the core/non-core issue, and has chosen the bankruptcy\n\ncourt as her forum, her silence might connote consent.   See, e.g.,\n\n\n                                -10-\n\fHorwitz v. Alloy Auto. Co., 992 F.2d 100, 103 (7th Cir. 1993)\n\n(“Silence does not imply consent, but affirmatively invoking the\n\nbankruptcy court’s jurisdiction most assuredly supplies whatever\n\nconsent is necessary.”) (citations omitted). As Michels is not the\n\nappellant, and appellant Sheridan did not initiate the disciplinary\n\nproceeding, we need not address this issue.3\n\n            Similarly, Bankruptcy Rule 7012(b) prescribes that the\n\ndefendant’s answer “shall admit or deny an allegation that the\n\nproceeding    is   core   or   non-core,”   and   that   “[i]n   non-core\n\nproceedings[,] final orders and judgments shall not be entered on\n\nthe bankruptcy judge’s order except with the express consent of the\n\nparties.”    By implication, therefore, there was no need for the\n\nSheridan answer to challenge the core nature of the proceedings\n\n\n     3\n      The dissent relies upon various cases, some cited with\napproval in In re G.S.F., in which the specific issue involved\nconsent by a party – unlike Sheridan – who had invoked the\nbankruptcy court’s jurisdiction. See Canal Corp. v. Finnman (In re\nJohnson), 960 F.2d 396, 398 (4th Cir. 1992) (noting that appellant\nwas plaintiff in adversary proceeding); Mann v. Alexander Dawson,\nInc. (In re Mann), 907 F.2d 923, 925-26 (9th Cir. 1990) (same);\nDaniels-Head & Assocs. v. William M. Mercer, Inc. (In re Daniels-\nHead & Assocs.), 819 F.2d 914, 919 (9th Cir. 1987) (same); Pisgah\nContractors, Inc. v. Rosen (In re Pisgah Contractors, Inc.), 215\nB.R. 679, 682 (W.D.N.C. 1995) (“[B]y asserting a counterclaim\nagainst the debtor in the adversary proceeding, the Rosens\nsubjected themselves to the equitable power of the Bankruptcy\nCourt.”); Jefferson Nat’l Bank v. I.A. Durbin, Inc. (In re I.A.\nDurbin, Inc.), 62 B.R. 139, 143 (S.D. Fla. 1986) (finding implied\nconsent where counterclaimant-appellant had joined in a third\nparty’s counterclaim, knowing that her co-complainant already had\nadmitted that her counterclaim involved a core proceeding); cf.,\ne.g., Marshall v. Mich. Dep’t of Agric. (In re Marshall), 118 B.R.\n954, 960 (W.D. Mich. 1990) (refusing to find implied consent where\nappellant’s counterclaim was compulsory).\n\n                                  -11-\n\fdue to the fact that the complaint made no such allegation.4\n\n            Moreover, absent the parties’ allegations, the bankruptcy\n\ncourt is required in all cases to make a sua sponte determination\n\nas to whether or not a proceeding is core, 28 U.S.C. § 157(b)(3)\n\n(“The bankruptcy judge shall determine, on the judge’s own motion\n\nor on timely motion of a party, whether a proceeding is a core\n\nproceeding.”) (emphasis added), and it seems quite clear that this\n\nprovision    would   have   been   phrased    very   differently    were   the\n\nCongress    to   have   intended   that    all   “related   to”   proceedings\n\nreferred to the bankruptcy court were to be deemed presumptively\n\ncore.\n\n            Of course, whether the Sheridan proceeding was core or\n\nnon-core, the bankruptcy court was empowered to hear the case and\n\nreceive evidence.       See 28 U.S.C. § 157(c)(1) (“A bankruptcy judge\n\nmay hear a proceeding that is not a core proceeding but that is\n\notherwise related to a case under title 11.”). Thus, the core/non-\n\ncore distinction would have significance primarily at the time of\n\njudgment, when it would become necessary to characterize the\n\nbankruptcy court order either as a final judgment (viz., enabling\n\n\n     4\n      Again, the dissent relies upon inapposite case law and\nauthorities wherein the defendant-appellant’s answer had failed to\ndeny an express allegation of core jurisdiction.        See Pisgah\nContractors, 215 B.R. at 682; Aero-Fastener, Inc. v. Sierracin (In\nre Aero-Fastener, Inc.), 177 B.R. 120, 132 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1994);\n1 Lawrence P. King, Collier on Bankruptcy § 3.02[6][b] (“The effect\nof failure to interpose an objection at the pleading stage should\nbe consent to the final order being entered by the bankruptcy\njudge.”) (emphasis added).\n\n                                    -12-\n\fan immediate appeal either to the district court or the BAP), or as\n\na recommended decision (viz., necessitating its referral back to\n\nthe district court for entry of a final, appealable judgment).5\n\n           Thus, in the instant case, until the bankruptcy court\n\nentered   its   “final”   judgment    characterizing   the   disciplinary\n\nproceeding as core, Sheridan was not placed on notice, either by\n\nthe bankruptcy court or Special Counsel, that the hearing would be\n\nso characterized.     Finally, Sheridan objected at the earliest\n\navailable opportunity by submitting a timely postjudgment motion\n\nfor reconsideration.6      Accordingly, in these circumstances we\n\n\n     5\n      In contrast to our limited holding in G.S.F., other courts\nhave split on the issue as to whether Bankruptcy Code § 157(c)\nconsent may be implied merely from the party’s failure to object,\nin a timely manner, to the hearing of the proceeding by the\nbankruptcy court. Compare, e.g., In re Hatfield, 117 B.R. 387, 388\nn.1 (Bankr. C.D. Ill. 1990) (drawing such inference), with Cont’l\nAirlines, Inc. v. First Sec. Bank of Utah, N.A. (In re Cont’l\nAirlines, Inc.), 146 B.R. 534, 536 (Bankr. D. Del. 1992) (“Implied\nconsent is not sufficient to waive constitutional [core/non-core]\njurisdiction.”). The rationale for those former cases, propounding\nthe broad rule now embraced by our dissenting colleague, is not\nconsonant with either the provisions in or the commentary to\nFederal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7008, which plainly require\n“express consent.” See supra note 2.      Moreover, that rationale\nignores the important reality that the bankruptcy court is\nempowered to conduct hearings in both core and non-core\nproceedings.   See 28 U.S.C. § 157(c)(1).      Thus, a party which\nacquiesces in the bankruptcy court’s decision to hear the case\nwould not necessarily presume that the court intended its post-\nhearing decision to be final, as distinguished from recommendatory.\n     6\n      The primary authority the dissent cites for its expansive\ninterpretation of consent involved proceedings in which the courts\ndetermined that the appellants (unlike Sheridan) failed to object\neven after the bankruptcy court had entered a “final” judgment.\nSee McFarland v. Leyh (In re Tex. Gen. Petroleum Corp.), 52 F.3d\n1330, 1337 (5th Cir. 1995) (finding an implied waiver because\n\n                                     -13-\n\fconclude that the actions taken by Sheridan did not sufficiently\n\nconnote    consent   to      the   final     adjudication   of    the   omnibus\n\ndisciplinary proceeding by the bankruptcy court.\n\nB.   Waiver/Forfeiture\n\n           In light of the BAP’s failure to address the core/non-\n\ncore issue, however, see Sheridan, 282 B.R. at 86-89, we now must\n\ndetermine whether Sheridan’s argumentation on the core/non-core\n\nissue,    as   set   forth     both   in     his   postjudgment   motion   for\n\nreconsideration and his appellate briefs before the BAP and this\n\ncourt, is sufficiently clear and developed to focus appellate\n\n\ndefendant-appellant “fail[ed] to object in the bankruptcy court,”\nappealed to the district court instead of seeking de novo review,\nand “his objection to jurisdiction at this stage [viz., on appeal\nto the court of appeals] ‘more closely resembles an afterthought’”)\n(citation omitted); Abramowitz v. Palmer, 999 F.2d 1274, 1276 (8th\nCir. 1983) (implied consent found where defendant-appellant did not\nraise her non-core argument before the bankruptcy court, she\nappealed the bankruptcy court’s dischargeability decision to the\ndistrict court, rather than seeking its de novo review, and she\nraised her non-core argument “for the first time” before the court\nof appeals); Canal Corp. v. Finnman (In re Johnson), 960 F.2d 396,\n403 (4th Cir. 1992) (implied consent found because plaintiff-\nappellants were “apparently content” when bankruptcy court entered\nits “final” judgment to distribute monies to appellants, and\nobjected only after the bankruptcy court had modified its judgment\nso as to reallocate the monies among various members of the\nplaintiff class); Men’s Sportswear, Inc. v. Sasson Jeans, Inc. (In\nre Men’s Sportswear, Inc.), 834 F.2d 1134, 1138 (2d Cir. 1987)\n(noting that appellant failed to raise non-core issue even after\nbankruptcy court issued its judgment explicitly declaring the\nproceeding core, and even on appellant's appeal to the district\ncourt); DuVoisin v. Foster (In re S. Indus. Banking Corp.), 809\nF.2d 329, 331 (6th Cir. 1987) (finding implied consent where\ndefendant-appellant's answer (i) stated without qualification that\nbankruptcy court had “jurisdiction,” (ii) raised no jurisdictional\nchallenge before judgment, and (iii) marked the bankruptcy court\norder as “agreed for entry”).\n\n                                      -14-\n\fattention    upon   the    merits   of    the   core/non-core   issue.   See\n\nMulvihill v. Top-Flite Golf Co., 335 F.3d 15, 27 (1st Cir. 2003)\n\n(noting that issues raised in perfunctory manner on appeal are\n\ndeemed waived).     Our review reveals that Sheridan lumped together\n\na   host    of   jurisdictional     and     non-jurisdictional    challenges\n\npredicated upon the central premise that the bankruptcy court\n\nlacked any “authority” whatsoever to impose monetary sanctions as\n\na condition precedent to his reinstatement to the bar.            Given this\n\ncircumstance, therefore, we understand how the issue may have\n\neluded the BAP's attention.\n\n            Although it may be that Sheridan, had he been represented\n\nby counsel,7 would have advanced his argument more prominently and\n\ndistinctly than was done in his pro se submissions, we cannot\n\nfairly conclude that Sheridan failed either to raise the argument,\n\nor to discuss the criteria most pertinent to the core/non-core\n\nanalysis. For instance, in his motion for reconsideration Sheridan\n\nplainly contended:        “As such the Bankruptcy [C]ourt does not share\n\nall the powers of the district court. Thus in [Northern Pipeline],\n\nthe United States Supreme Court held that it was unconstitutional\n\nfor the Bankruptcy Courts to exercise the ‘essential attributes of\n\n\n     7\n      By way of bolstering its inference that Sheridan consented,\nthe dissenting opinion adverts to Sheridan as “an experienced\nbankruptcy attorney,” while failing to acknowledge that these\ndisciplinary proceedings arose, at least in part, from Sheridan’s\nnumerous physical ailments and mental impairments. The district\ncourt has yet to be accorded the opportunity to make the requisite\nfindings of fact on this issue.\n\n                                     -15-\n\fthe judicial power of the Article III district court,’ and that the\n\nbankruptcy court’s power was limited to ‘core proceedings’ of the\n\nadministration of the bankruptcy estate under the bankruptcy code,\n\n28 U.S.C. § 157(b)(1).” (Emphasis added; citations omitted.)\n\n           Not only is Northern Pipeline the seminal case on the\n\nconstitutional limitations which undergird the pivotal core/non-\n\ncore distinction, but the utter absence of a close nexus between\n\nthe Sheridan disciplinary proceeding and the administration of any\n\nparticular pending bankruptcy proceeding is a crucial consideration\n\nin resolving the core/non-core issue. See 28 U.S.C. § 157(b)(2)(A)\n\n(noting   that    core    proceedings    involve,    inter   alia,   “matters\n\nconcerning the administration of the estate”) (emphasis added);\n\ninfra   Section   II.C.      Moreover,    Sheridan    reiterated     the   same\n\nargument verbatim, both before the BAP and in the instant appeal,\n\nby relying upon the same citation to, and paraphrase of, the\n\nNorthern Pipeline holding, then adding: “The disciplinary order in\n\neach of the cases cited by the [BAP] arose out of and during the\n\nadministration of a single bankruptcy estate.” (Emphasis added.)\n\nThus, though Sheridan might have asserted the issue with somewhat\n\nmore prominence and clarity, we are hard-pressed to find, on these\n\nsubmissions, that the argument was conclusively forfeited.                 “[A]\n\ncourt should not lightly infer from a litigant's conduct consent to\n\nhave private state-created rights adjudicated by a non-Article III\n\nbankruptcy judge. Indeed, to do so would violate the spirit of\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\f[Northern Pipeline].” In re Men's Sportswear, Inc., 834 F.2d 1134,\n\n1138 (2d Cir. 1987).8\n\n          No   less   importantly,   even   in   the   event   we   were   to\n\nconclude that Sheridan forfeited the instant issue below, see\n\n\n\n     8\n      Nor can the Sheridan decision to appeal to the BAP, rather\nthan the district court, be deemed implied consent. Normally, a\nbankruptcy court decision in a non-core proceeding is not\nappealable to the BAP, but must be taken to the district court.\nHere, however, the bankruptcy court purportedly entered a decision\non the merits in what it termed a core proceeding, thereby\nrendering its judgment (unless vacated on appeal) final and\nappealable. See In re M.A. Baheth Constr. Co., 118 F.3d 1082, 1084\n(5th Cir. 1997) (“Until and unless the determination of bankruptcy\ncourt jurisdiction is overturned, Baheth was bound to comply with\nthe court's judgment – and the procedural consequences thereof.”).\nAppeals from such a judgment lie either with the BAP or the\ndistrict court, sitting in its appellate capacity. See 28 U.S.C.\n§ 158(c)(1). Thus, either the BAP or the district court would have\njurisdiction   to   determine   whether   the  bankruptcy   court’s\ndesignation of the proceeding as core constituted reversible error.\n     We find equally enigmatic the related suggestion in the\ndissenting opinion that Sheridan expressly abandoned his objection\nto the bankruptcy court’s core treatment of the proceeding. In his\n15-page supplemental brief Sheridan vehemently disputes that he\never consented, asserting instead that he promptly raised the\ncore/non-core issue in his motion for reconsideration before the\nbankruptcy court. Michels, the party whose burden it was to allege\nthat the proceeding was core, declined our invitation to submit\nsupplemental briefing. Sheridan did note that he would “take[] no\nposition” on the non-core issue, but not because he conceded that\nit lacked merit, nor that it was not in his interest to pursue it.\nInstead, he noted that it was supported by “ample authority.” He\nbelieved (albeit incorrectly) that the jurisdictional issue became\nrelevant only if we were to find that the bankruptcy court had\nissued the sanction under Administrative Order 2090-2 only, and not\npursuant to Bankruptcy Code § 105.        This is a far cry from\nabandonment. Assuming that further evidence that Sheridan had not\nabandoned this claim was needed, however, his supplemental brief,\nin its final citation, points to In re BNI Telecommuns., 246 B.R.\n845, 849 (B.A.P. 6th Cir. 2000), a case in which the Sixth Circuit\nreversed a bankruptcy court for improperly entering a final\njudgment in a non-core proceeding without appellant’s consent.\n\n                                 -17-\n\fMulvihill, 335 F.3d at 27, it is within our discretion to address\n\nan issue de novo, in those rare instances where the issue poses\n\n“purely a question of law; where addressing the merits promotes\n\njudicial economy as the same issue will likely be raised in other\n\ncases; and the claim raises an issue of constitutional magnitude,\n\nwhich if meritorious, could substantially affect the rights of\n\ncreditors and debtors in this and future bankruptcy proceedings.”\n\nIn re Weinstein, 164 F.3d 677, 685 (1st Cir.) (reaching unpreserved\n\nFifth Amendment Takings Clause issue), cert. denied, 527 U.S. 1036\n\n(1999); United States v. La Guardia, 902 F.2d 1010, 1013 (1st Cir.\n\n1990) (reaching unpreserved due process challenge to sentencing\n\nguidelines).\n\n            The core/non-core argument advanced by Sheridan suits the\n\nbill on all three criteria.         The question as to whether the\n\nproceeding is core or non-core poses a pure question of law,\n\nsubject to plenary appellate review.       See In re Graves, 279 B.R. at\n\n270.   As    the   extended   procedural   travel   of   this   case   amply\n\ndemonstrates, the proper characterization, ab initio, of this type\n\nof omnibus disciplinary proceeding – as either core or non-core –\n\nis likely to minimize substantially the waste of judicial resources\n\nin future cases.    For example, had this proceeding been considered\n\nnon-core from the outset, the Sheridan appeals to the BAP and to\n\nthis court could not have occurred, the case would have proceeded\n\ndirectly to the district court to decide whether to adopt or reject\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\fthe recommended findings of fact and legal conclusions made by the\n\nbankruptcy court, and Sheridan may well have averted almost two\n\nyears of suspension from his professional livelihood.9\n\n           Finally,   the   core/non-core   distinction   advanced   in\n\nNorthern Pipeline unquestionably is one of constitutional import,\n\nin that it concerns the authority of an Article I court to enter a\n\nfinal judgment in a non-core proceeding absent the consent of the\n\nparties.   Thus, even assuming we were to conclude that Sheridan’s\n\npresentation of the core/non-core contention before the bankruptcy\n\ncourt and the BAP was inadequate, we would consider this case an\n\nappropriate one in which to conduct de novo review, rather than\n\nplain error review.10\n\n\n     9\n      The consequences of the core/non-core determination cannot\nfairly be understated. Thus, if the bankruptcy court decision were\nnot a final judgment, but merely a recommendation for entry of\njudgment, the Sheridan suspension from law practice would be\npremature, and could never have taken effect unless and until the\ndistrict court adopted the recommended decision entered by the\nbankruptcy court. Similarly, had the district court adopted the\nbankruptcy court recommendation, the issues upon which Sheridan\nmight base his appeal would be drastically altered. That is to\nsay, in that event the question would not be whether the bankruptcy\ncourt rules or administrative orders authorized this type of\nsanction, but whether the district court’s rules and orders\nauthorized such a sanction. See U.S. Dist. Ct. Local Rule (D.N.H.)\n83.5.\n     10\n      With respect, we must note that our dissenting colleague's\ndisapproval of our recourse to the La Guardia exception flows from\nseveral faulty premises. The dissent insists that Sheridan did not\nraise the core/non-core issue on appeal or if he did, inexplicably\nabandoned it after devoting several pages of supplemental briefing\nto a denial that he consented to core treatment. See supra note 8.\nThe dissent further states that the non-core issue is not one of\nconstitutional dimension. To the contrary, even the authorities\n\n                                 -19-\n\fC.   Core vs. Non-core\n\n            Notwithstanding    the    jurisdictional   issues    raised   by\n\nSheridan, see supra, the bankruptcy court failed to elaborate upon\n\nits rationale for ruling that the instant omnibus disciplinary\n\naction constitutes a core proceeding.        See 28 U.S.C. § 157(b)(3).\n\nGenerally    speaking,   a    proceeding    which   “arises     under”    the\n\nbankruptcy laws is considered core.         See 28 U.S.C. § 157(b)(1);\n\n\n\n\ncited by the dissent acknowledge that Northern Pipeline, which §\n157 purports to implement, involved a litigant’s constitutional\nright to have his case heard by an Article III court. See, e.g.,\nIn re Tex. Gen. Petroleum Corp., 52 F.3d at 1336 (“[Appellant’s\ncore/non-core] argument, however, is a constitutional one based on\nArticle III.   We must undertake the constitutional analysis.”).\nThe dissent then mischaracterizes our delineation of the factors\nwhich render this particular type of omnibus disciplinary\nproceeding non-core as involving a factual determination, whereas\nit is a purely legal determination as to what essential attributes\nof this proceeding satisfy the legal criteria set forth in §\n157(b)(2). See, e.g., In re Graves, 279 B.R. at 270 (noting that\nthe core/noncore determination is a question of law). The dissent\nfurther contends that the legal argument for characterizing the\nSheridan disciplinary proceeding as non-core is not compelling,\neven though the dissent cites no contrary authority directly on\npoint, and the Sheridan disciplinary proceeding meets none of the\ncriteria set forth in Bankruptcy Code § 157(b)(2).       See infra\nSection II.C.; Eleccion v. Sogge (In re Hessinger & Assocs.), 192\nB.R. 211, 219-20 (N.D. Cal. 1996) (holding that omnibus\ndisciplinary proceedings are non-core).      Finally, despite its\nadmission that these types of omnibus proceedings have occurred in\nthe past, the dissent rejects our resort to the La Guardia\nexception based on its surmise that the bankruptcy courts are not\nlikely to resort to such omnibus disciplinary proceedings in the\nfuture. One readily can envision, however, that an Article I court\n– once reassured that it is exercising its core authority – would\nbe hard put to resist the streamlined disciplinary procedures and\nfinality afforded by these proceedings.\n\n                                     -20-\n\fBoroff v. Tully (In re Tully), 818 F.2d 106, 108 (1st Cir. 1987).11\n\nThis statutory provision prescribes a non-exhaustive exemplar of\n\ncore proceedings, 28 U.S.C. § 157(b)(2)(A)-(O), including the\n\nallowance and disallowance of proofs of claim, orders to turn over\n\nproperty   to    the   estate,   proceedings   to   avoid   preferences   or\n\nfraudulent conveyances, motions to lift automatic stays, and the\n\nadjudication of objections to discharge.         Importantly, each of the\n\nenumerated      matters   relates   to   a   function   essential   to    the\n\nadministration of the bankruptcy case.\n\n           In addition to these more particular functions, there are\n\ntwo broadly phrased categories which relate more generally to other\n\n\n\n     11\n      The dissent advances but two arguments premised upon\nauthority which predates the enactment of § 157(b).      First, it\nproposes the following syllogism:    (1) all non-core proceedings\ninvolve state contract claims, see Thomas v. Union Carbide Agric.\nProds. Co., 473 U.S. 584 (1985); (2) the Sheridan disciplinary\nproceeding involved no such claim; and (3) consequently, the\nSheridan disciplinary proceeding is not a non-core proceeding. The\ninitial premise is flawed, however. Thomas simply describes its\nNorthern Pipeline holding, but does not announce that the Court\nwould forbear in future cases from extending the Northern Pipeline\nrationale to other types of analogous claims. Second, the dissent\ncites our decision in In re Arnold Print Works, Inc., 815 F.2d 165\n(1st Cir. 1987), for the proposition that attorney disciplinary\nactions against attorneys do not involve private contract-based\nrights, but “public rights” which non-Article III courts have\nalways been permitted to adjudicate. However, Arnold addresses the\nsomewhat arcane public rights doctrine, which describes a very\nnarrow category of claims of a sort which Article III courts are\ninstitutionally capable of adjudicating, but which historically\nwere resolved instead by legislative or administrative courts. See\nNorthern Pipeline, 458 U.S. at 67-68.         Obviously, attorney\ndisciplinary actions, long within the province of the federal\ncourts, do not comport with this specialized “public rights”\ndefinition.\n\n                                    -21-\n\f“matters concerning the administration of the estate,” id. §\n\n157(b)(2)(A), and “other proceedings affecting the liquidation of\n\nthe assets of the estate or the adjustment of the debtor-creditor\n\nor the equity security holder relationship, except personal injury\n\ntort or wrongful death claims,”       id. § 157(b)(2)(O).    It is\n\nimportant to note that the matters adumbrated in Bankruptcy Code §\n\n157(b)(2)(A) and (O) likewise typically arise within the context of\n\na particular bankruptcy case, and are essential to the efficient\n\nadministration of the bankruptcy case.12   Thus, to the extent that\n\nattorney misconduct may have thwarted the efforts of the bankruptcy\n\ncourt to bring a particular bankruptcy proceeding efficiently to\n\nconclusion, it is at least arguable that attorney disciplinary\n\nproceedings occurring during such a case can be classified as core.\n\n          On the other hand, the omnibus disciplinary proceeding\n\ninitiated against Sheridan is essentially different, in that the\n\nethical violations in which Sheridan allegedly engaged, for the\n\n\n     12\n      The dissenting opinion suggests, incorrectly, that we rely\nupon the expressio unius principle to interpret § 157(b), thereby\nignoring the explicit nonexclusivity of the § 157(b)(2) listing.\nSee Lohnes v. Level 3 Communications, Inc., 272 F.3d 49, 61 (1st\nCir. 2001) (“[T]he maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius\ninstructs that, ‘when parties list specific items in a document,\nany item not so listed is typically thought to be excluded.’”)\n(citation omitted). On the contrary, any attempted extrapolation\nof the § 157(b)(2) listing must be guided by reference to those\nessential characteristics which the listed proceedings share in\ncommon, see Aceros Prefabricados, S.A. v. TradeArbed, Inc., 282\nF.3d 92, 101-02 (2d Cir. 2002); Collier v. Gray, 167 F.3d 977, 981\n(6th Cir. 1999), and unlike the Sheridan omnibus disciplinary\nproceeding, all of the proceedings in the § 157(b) listing arise as\npart of the ongoing administration of “the” bankruptcy estate.\n\n                               -22-\n\fmost part, occurred during the course of numerous bankruptcy cases\n\npreviously closed, rather than in a pending bankruptcy proceeding,\n\nthus cannot be said to have involved the sort of routine case\n\n“administration” described in § 157(b)(2). Unlike disciplinary\n\nactions brought      against    counsel    in   the   course    of   an   ongoing\n\nbankruptcy case,13 the Sheridan disciplinary proceedings did not\n\npurport to adjust the legal relationships among the parties in\n\nthese     closed   bankruptcy   cases,    but   consisted      largely    of   the\n\nbankruptcy court’s exercise of its supervisory responsibility to\n\noversee and regulate its bar so as to safeguard public confidence\n\nin the integrity and functionality of the bankruptcy court.                    See,\n\ne.g., Eleccion v. Sogge (In re Hessinger & Assocs.), 192 B.R. 211,\n\n219-20 (N.D. Cal. 1996) (noting that disciplinary action conducted\n\noutside particular bankruptcy proceeding is non-core, “concerned\n\nsolely with the issue of the [law] firm’s professional misconduct\n\n[as defined by the California Rules of Professional Conduct] and\n\naddressed neither the assets of any bankruptcy estate nor the\n\nadjustment of debtor-creditor relations”).14           Indeed, no present or\n\n\n     13\n      All the cases the dissent cites in support of the so-called\n“core comes from core” principle involved discipline imposed for\nattorney misconduct in a single, ongoing bankruptcy case. See,\ne.g., In re Mem’l Estates, Inc., 950 F.2d 1364, 1370 (7th Cir.\n1991) (finding that sanction “affect[ed] the liquidation of the\nassets of the estate”).\n     14\n      In advancing its contention that this court cites no\nauthority for the proposition that the § 157(b) listing restricts\ncore proceedings to those which arise as part of the administration\nof a single bankruptcy case, the dissent fails to acknowledge\n\n                                    -23-\n\fformer client ever lodged a complaint against Sheridan.\n\n            Although a determination that Sheridan breached ethical\n\ncanons could conceivably enable these closed cases to be reopened,\n\npossibly with a view to recovering attorney fees paid to him by the\n\nrespective estates, cf., e.g., id. at 220 (distinguishing non-core\n\nomnibus disciplinary action from two other cases under review where\n\nattorney sanctions were “pursued in the course of processing a\n\nbankruptcy petition,” and where “finding that a law firm violated\n\nthe Rules    [of   Professional   Conduct]   could   lead   to    that   firm\n\nforfeiting its fees . . . and such forfeiture would ‘affect the\n\nliquidation of the assets of the estate’”),15           the disciplinary\n\naction against Sheridan had no such purpose or effect, since its\n\nremedial    goal   focused   exclusively   upon   Sheridan’s     fitness   to\n\nrepresent clients in future bankruptcy cases, rather than upon any\n\n\nHessinger, the one and only extant case directly on point.     In\nresponse, the dissent cites a string of cases involving omnibus\ndisciplinary proceedings, while conceding that the parties in all\nthose cases (unlike in Hessinger) never raised the core/non-core\nissue for resolution by those courts. See, e.g., Household Credit\nServs., Inc. v. Dragoo (In re Dragoo), 219 B.R. 460 (Bankr. N.D.\nTex. 1998).\n\n     15\n       Similarly, some courts have held that the bankruptcy court\nmay issue “final” contempt orders in an ongoing case to discipline\ncounsel for noncompliance with court orders, since noncompliance\nobviously hampers the efficacy of liquidation and reorganization\nproceedings. See In re Woodward, 229 B.R. 468, 477 (Bankr. N.D.\nOkla. 1999); cf. Volpert v. Volpert (In re Volpert), 186 B.R. 240,\n245 (N.D. Ill. 1995) (noting that sanctions imposed under Fed. R.\nBankr. P. 9001 for dilatory conduct by counsel in an ongoing\nbankruptcy case are core matters), aff’d, 110 F.3d 494 (7th Cir.\n1997).\n\n                                   -24-\n\frecoupment of estate funds attributable to Sheridan’s misconduct.\n\nThus, no matter what the outcome of the disciplinary proceeding\n\nagainst Sheridan, no pending or closed bankruptcy case would be\n\naffected unless further independent proceedings were instituted in\n\nthe future.    At the present juncture, however, any prediction of\n\nsuch an eventuality would be pure speculative.        See, e.g., Warren\n\nv. Calania Corp., 178 B.R. 279, 281 (M.D. Fla. 1995) (holding that\n\nattorney disciplinary proceedings were not core, since “[t]he fact\n\nthat potential proceeds of the action may be distributed by the\n\n[bankruptcy] court if an award is received is not enough”).\n\n          Omnibus disciplinary proceedings predicated upon alleged\n\nviolations of ethical rules are further distinguishable in that the\n\nrights protected thereby do not derive from the Bankruptcy Code,\n\nbut from state law, viz., in this instance, the New Hampshire Rules\n\nof Professional Conduct.       See In re G.S.F. Corp., 938 F.2d at 1475\n\n(noting that core proceedings normally involve rights derived from\n\nbankruptcy law, and “depend on the Bankruptcy [Code] for their\n\nexistence”); Bethlahmy v. Kuhlman (In re ACI-HDT Supply Co.), 205\n\nB.R. 231, 236 (B.A.P. 9th Cir. 1997) (\"[A] proceeding ‘will not be\n\nconsidered a core matter, even if it falls within the literal\n\nlanguage of § 157(b)(2)(A) or 157(b)(2)(O), if it is a state law\n\nclaim   that   could   exist    outside   of   bankruptcy   and   is   not\n\ninextricably bound to the claims allowance process or a right\n\ncreated by the Bankruptcy Code.’”) (citation omitted); Jackson v.\n\n\n                                   -25-\n\fWessel (In re Jackson), 90 B.R. 126, 129 (Bankr. E.D. Pa. 1988)\n\n(“‘[C]ontroversies that do not depend on the bankruptcy laws for\n\ntheir existence – suits that could proceed in another court even in\n\nthe absence of bankruptcy – are not core proceedings.’”) (citation\n\nomitted), aff’d, 118 B.R. 243 (E.D. Pa. 1990).                  Indeed, the\n\nstandards for admission to the bar of the United States District\n\nCourt for the District of New Hampshire essentially “piggyback”\n\nupon the state’s rules of professional conduct (albeit that state\n\nlaw is expressly adopted by the federal court in the particular\n\njurisdiction).      See U.S. Dist. Ct. Local Rule (D.N.H.) 83.1(a)\n\n(“Any member in good standing of the bar of the Supreme Court of\n\nNew   Hampshire     is   eligible   for    admission.”).   Although       the\n\npredominance   of    state-law   issues,    standing   alone,    cannot   be\n\ndeterminative, see 28 U.S.C. § 157(b)(3) (“A determination that a\n\nproceeding is not a core proceeding shall not be made solely on the\n\nbasis that its resolution may be affected by state law.”) (emphasis\n\nadded), undoubtedly it is one relevant factor in the core/non-core\n\ninquiry.16\n\n\n      16\n      The dissent contends that rules regulating attorney conduct\nin federal court are strictly a matter of federal law, not state\nlaw. We do not disagree. Our point is simply that the source of\nthe rules governing Sheridan’s case is the state rules, which in\nthis instance were adopted wholesale as the federal district\ncourt's own rules. Cf. In re Snyder, 472 U.S. 634, 645 n.6 (1985)\n(noting that state rules were not applicable in federal court\nbecause “[t]he state code of professional responsibility [did] not\nby its terms apply to sanctions in federal court”). Nor does our\ncase involve the wholly distinct question as to whether to apply a\nfederal rule or a state rule which proscribes the identical\n\n                                    -26-\n\f          Moving beyond the explicit constraints in the statute\n\nitself, sound policy concerns likewise compel such distinctions.\n\nWhere, as here, the attorney misconduct occurred neither in the\n\ncontext of an ongoing bankruptcy case, nor in the presence of the\n\nbankruptcy court, the bankruptcy court may have no better vantage\n\nfrom which to make final findings of fact than would the district\n\ncourt. See Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9033(d) (empowering district court to\n\nreceive   further   evidence   before   deciding   whether   to   adopt\n\nbankruptcy court’s recommended decision).    Consequently, this sort\n\nof omnibus disciplinary proceeding is far different from the\n\njohnny-on-the-spot disciplinary proceedings relating to errant\n\nattorney conduct occurring during an ongoing bankruptcy case, which\n\nmay be essential to the fair and efficient administration of the\n\n\n\n\nconduct. See In re Larry’s Apartment, L.L.C., 249 F.3d 832, 838-39\n(9th Cir. 2001) (undertaking analysis under Eerie doctrine, and\nholding that a state law imposing sanctions for an attorney’s\nfiling of a lawsuit for an improper purpose was inapplicable in\nfederal court, given the existence of federal rules – viz., Federal\nCivil Rule of Procedure 11 or 28 U.S.C. § 1927 – proscribing the\nsame misconduct). In attempting to demonstrate that our reference\nto the state ethical rules is wholly “beside the point,” the\ndissent quotes Arnold Print Works, 815 F.2d at 169,       where we\nstated that “[i]t is the nature of the proceeding – its relation to\na basic function of the bankruptcy court – not the federal or state\nbasis for the claim, that makes the difference here.” (Emphasis\nadded.)    The quoted statement plainly does not support the\ndissent’s contention that the primacy of state law can never be\nweighed as a factor in the core/non-core analysis; and were there\nto be any doubt, we further observed that “the fact that a\nbankruptcy matter raises issues of state, rather than federal, law\ndoes not by itself determine that it is non-core, rather than\ncore.” Id. (emphasis added).\n\n                                 -27-\n\fbankrupt estate.17\n\n          In this type of omnibus disciplinary proceeding, which\n\nrelates to multiple bankruptcy cases extending over a considerable\n\n\n\n     17\n      The dissent further suggests that our holding will undermine\nthe bankruptcy courts’ ability to administer cases with efficiency\nand dispatch.   Although we need not resolve the issue today, a\nstrong argument could be made that § 157(b) contemplates that\nattorney discipline imposed in the midst of an ongoing case\nadministration would be a core proceeding, even if the attorney’s\nconduct itself occurred during a non-core proceeding, precisely\nbecause the discipline concerns the administration of the estate\nand the prospects that the bankruptcy court will be able to bring\nthe case to successful conclusion.        In those circumstances,\nimmediate discipline serves the purpose of expedition, rather than\nthwarting it.\n     Throughout, the dissent inexplicably describes our non-core\ntreatment of an omnibus disciplinary proceeding as a “penalty,”\nwhich the bankruptcy courts will scurry to avoid at all costs, even\nif it means the tedious reopening of each constituent case, or the\nmanipulation of the form of a disciplinary proceeding in a single\nbankruptcy case so as to introduce in evidence attorney misconduct\narising in the other unrelated cases. In re Ludwick, 185 B.R. 238\n(Bankr. S.D. Mich. 1995), however, clearly was not an attempt to\nmanipulate the form of a disciplinary proceeding to avoid a non-\ncore designation. The bankruptcy attorney was accused of forging\none client’s (i.e., Ludwick’s) signature.      During disciplinary\nhearings, a second client of the attorney in an unrelated\nbankruptcy case testified that the attorney had also forged his\nsignature. The court sanctioned the attorney only to compensate\nLudwick for the Ludwick forgery, not the other forgery. Id. at 244\n(noting that court used evidence of second forgery only on the\nissue of the attorney’s credibility in denying the Ludwick\nforgery).\n     We can perceive no sound basis for the curious conclusion that\nthe bankruptcy courts would be unreasonably covetous of the power\nto issue a final disciplinary order, rather than a recommendatory\ndecision subject to de novo review by the district court.       The\nmutual goal of the bankruptcy courts and the district courts alike\nis the deterrence of attorney misconduct.            Thus, omnibus\nproceedings are – and will remain – an efficient means to\ninvestigate attorney conduct spanning dozens of bankruptcy cases,\nas well as a viable option for the bankruptcy courts following our\ndecision.\n\n                               -28-\n\fperiod of time, the alleged misconduct may have occurred either\n\nbefore multiple bankruptcy judges in a multi-judge district, or\n\nentirely or partially outside the presence of the bankruptcy judge\n\nwho   hears    the    disciplinary         case.        Here,        for    instance,    the\n\nbankruptcy     court       appointed      Michels     to       investigate       Sheridan’s\n\nconduct, much of which allegedly occurred outside the courtroom. In\n\nsuch cases, the bankruptcy judge would seem to have no greater\n\nexpertise as a factfinder than the district court.\n\n              We do not question that the case law overwhelmingly\n\nsuggests      that    the    bankruptcy       court     possesses          the    requisite\n\nauthority, either inherent or statutory, to regulate its bar as\n\nnecessary and appropriate.                See supra note 1.                Nor do we hold\n\notherwise.      In the instant case, however, the bankruptcy court\n\nexercised     its    authority       to   take     disciplinary            action   against\n\nSheridan,      and    we    simply     hold      that      —    in    these      particular\n\ncircumstances — the bankruptcy court was not empowered to arrive at\n\na final resolution of the disciplinary matter absent further\n\ndistrict court participation and oversight.\n\n              The requirement that the district court arrive at a\n\nfinal, plenary disciplinary disposition further recognizes that\n\ndisbarment and suspension plainly are among the more grievous\n\nsanctions     which    can    be   imposed.         Thus,       the    imposition       of   a\n\n$30,377.50 fine, as a condition precedent to readmission to the\n\nbar, is onerous indeed; the more so in the present circumstances\n\n\n                                           -29-\n\fwhere numerous ethical violations spanning numerous bankruptcy\n\ncases were conglomerated into a single disciplinary proceeding\n\nafter the fact.   Cf., e.g., Bone v. Judah (In re Josey), 195 B.R.\n\n511, 516 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1996) (noting that imposition of sanction\n\nof suspension pursuant to bankruptcy court’s inherent powers is\n\n“very serious,” and under local district court rule is to be\n\nreferred for investigation to standing district court disciplinary\n\ncommittee).   The consolidated nature of this type of omnibus\n\ndisciplinary proceeding threatens to expose attorneys to much\n\nsteeper sanctions than might otherwise have been incurred as a\n\nresult of piece-meal disciplinary proceedings conducted at the time\n\nthe misconduct arose in each constituent bankruptcy case.    Thus,\n\nthe de novo review conducted by the district court accords counsel\n\nadditional procedural protections when confronting potentially\n\nharsh penalties. See Cunningham v. Ayers (In re Johnson), 921 F.2d\n\n585, 586 (5th Cir. 1991) (noting that district court undertook de\n\nnovo review).18\n\n          Finally, these disciplinary proceedings inevitably place\n\nthe bankruptcy court itself in an extremely awkward posture,\n\n\n     18\n      As suspensions and disbarments are “extreme” sanctions, the\ncourts frequently require heightened procedural protections, such\nas a showing of “bad faith” and “clear and convincing” evidence.\nSee, e.g., Fellheimer, Eichen & Braverman, P.C., 57 F.3d at 1224;\nIn re Cowboy Roofing, Inc., 193 B.R. at 446.        In that vein,\nSheridan argues on appeal that the bankruptcy court imposed a\nsanction unsupported by any evidence of bad faith on his part. We\ndo not evaluate this argument, as it is more appropriately\npresented to the district court following remand.\n\n                               -30-\n\fvulnerable to the public perception (if not charge) that the\n\nbankruptcy     court        is   inappropriately            acting     as     accuser,\n\ninvestigator, prosecutor, and judge.                 See Peugeot v. U.S. Tr. (In\n\nre Crayton), 192 B.R. 970, 978 (B.A.P. 9th Cir. 1996).                        Any such\n\nperception can be further allayed through recourse to the de novo\n\nreview conducted before the district court.                   After all, attorneys\n\nare admitted to practice before the district court, which admission\n\naccords    counsel   the     derivative        right   to     practice      before   the\n\nbankruptcy court within the district, by virtue of the fact that\n\nthe bankruptcy courts function as organizational units of the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n             We close with a final admonition:                our opinion is not to\n\nbe construed as holding that all attorney disciplinary proceedings\n\nbefore the bankruptcy court are to be presumptively considered non-\n\ncore.     Thus, had the Sheridan ethical violations occurred either\n\nduring the course of a bankruptcy case or within the immediate\n\npresence of the bankruptcy judge, or otherwise directly affected\n\nthe administration,         liquidation,        or   reorganization         efforts,    a\n\nstronger    demonstration        might    be    made    for    characterizing        the\n\ndisciplinary proceeding as a core matter.                       See, e.g., In re\n\nHessinger, 192 B.R. at 220 (noting that within an individual\n\nbankruptcy case a suspension or disbarment of counsel may more\n\nreadily be regarded as “affecting” asset liquidation, inasmuch as\n\ndisqualification       of    counsel     normally       affects      entitlement       to\n\n\n                                         -31-\n\fattorney fees recoverable from the bankrupt estate, or requires\n\nreimbursement   of   attorney   fees   previously   received,   hence\n\nincreasing the assets available for distribution).    As the instant\n\ncase implicates no such considerations, however, we reserve that\n\nmatter for another day.\n\n          In summary, the case at bar is distinguishable due\n\nprincipally to the following factors:     (i) the omnibus nature of\n\nthe disciplinary proceeding; (ii) the case did not arise in the\n\ncontext of an ongoing bankruptcy case, cf. In re Desilets, 247 B.R.\n\n660, 663 (Bankr. W.D. Mich. 2000) (holding that such an attorney\n\nsuspension constitutes core proceeding), aff’d, 255 B.R. 294 (W.D.\n\nMich. 2000), rev’d on other grounds, 291 F.3d 925 (6th Cir. 2002);\n\n(iii) these disciplinary charges were predicated upon alleged\n\nethical-rule violations proscribed by state law, rather than by the\n\nBankruptcy Code; and (iv) any potential effect the bankruptcy court\n\norder may have had upon a closed bankruptcy case is both remote and\n\noverly speculative, see Warren, 178 B.R. at 281.\n\n          As the BAP lacked subject matter jurisdiction in the\n\ninstant case, it is unnecessary to reach the merits of the Sheridan\n\ncontentions that the sanction imposed by the bankruptcy court was\n\nunwarranted in law or fact. Accordingly, the case must be remanded\n\nto the bankruptcy court for entry of its recommended findings of\n\nfact and conclusions of law, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 157(c)(1).\n\nThe instant dismissal is not to be interpreted as reflecting our\n\n\n                                -32-\n\fviews on the underlying merits of the Sheridan appeal or the\n\nauthority of the district court, vel non, to impose monetary\n\nsanctions as a condition precedent to Sheridan's readmission to the\n\nbar following the type of omnibus disciplinary proceeding conducted\n\nhere.\n\n           Accordingly, pending the entry of a final judgment by the\n\ndistrict court, based upon the recommended findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law entered by the bankruptcy court, Sheridan is\n\nreinstated to the bankruptcy court bar immediately. See supra note\n\n9.   Our decision shall be without prejudice to the right of a party\n\nto appeal from any district court order that finally disposes of\n\nthe recommended findings of fact and conclusions of law entered by\n\nthe bankruptcy court.\n\n           The BAP decision and the bankruptcy court decision are\n\nhereby vacated for want of jurisdiction.        Sheridan is hereby\n\nreinstated to the bankruptcy court bar, and the case is remanded to\n\nthe bankruptcy court for further proceedings consistent with this\n\nopinion. The parties are to bear their own costs.    SO ORDERED.\n\n\n\n                   - Concurring Opinion Follows -\n\n\n\n\n                                -33-\n\f          SELYA, Circuit Judge (concurring in the judgment).     I\n\nrecognize that the appellant did not make his jurisdictional\n\nargument with crystalline clarity, either to the BAP or in this\n\ncourt.   There are, however, extenuating circumstances, and in my\n\nview the LaGuardia/Weinstein exception is available here.     I am\n\ncomfortable in joining in the affirmative exercise of discretion\n\nneeded to invoke that exception, and, thus, reaching the important\n\nissue of classification (core versus non-core) that permeates this\n\nproceeding. While that issue is not free from doubt, my resolution\n\nof it tracks Judge Cyr's:   this omnibus disciplinary proceeding,\n\nwhich did not arise out of any matter(s) directly affecting the\n\nbankruptcy court's ability to administer one or more ongoing cases,\n\nis a non-core proceeding.     Consequently, the bankruptcy court\n\nlacked the authority to enter a final judgment.\n\n          I therefore concur in the vacation of the improvidently\n\nentered judgment and the concomitant remand.    If the appellant's\n\nconduct is deserving of discipline beyond the period of enforced\n\nsuspension that he already has experienced — a matter on which I\n\ntake no view — it is the district court which, in the circumstances\n\nof this proceeding, must impose it.\n\n\n\n                  - Dissenting Opinion Follows -\n\n\n\n\n                               -34-\n\f",

We   now    vacate      the\n\nbankruptcy court order, and remand for further proceedings.\n\n                                       I.\n\n                                 BACKGROUND\n\n           In June 2000, the bankruptcy judge appointed Attorney\n\nNancy   Michels   as   Special   Counsel       to   investigate     the    ethical\n\nviolations alleged against Sheridan, an attorney and member of the\n\nbankruptcy court bar.      Following an extensive investigation into\n\nSheridan’s representation of various clients between 1999 and 2000,\n\nSpecial Counsel lodged a complaint charging Sheridan with rendering\n\nincompetent   representation          in     violation   of   N.H.        Rule   of\n\nProfessional Conduct 1.1(a).\n\n           Although Sheridan, acting pro se, eventually stipulated\n\nto most of the allegations in the complaint, he contended that his\n\nconduct had been due either to a dopamine deficiency resulting in\n\nsevere attention deficit disorder or to the uncooperativeness and\n\nobstinacy of the affected clients.                  Following a disciplinary\n\nhearing in June 2001, the bankruptcy court determined that Sheridan\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fhad committed eighty-eight ethical violations, most involving the\n\nfailure to comply with such basic requirements as the timely filing\n\nof chapter 13 plans and motions for continuance.\n\n           In due course, Sheridan was suspended from practice\n\nbefore the bankruptcy court for one year; readmission contingent\n\nupon satisfactory proof that he was competent to represent clients\n\nbefore the bankruptcy court.      Subsequently, the bankruptcy court\n\napproved an application for a $30,377.50 attorney fee to Special\n\nCounsel, then directed that Sheridan – as a precondition to his\n\nreadmission to the bankruptcy bar – reimburse the bankruptcy court\n\nin that amount. Sheridan then appealed to the Bankruptcy Appellate\n\nPanel   (\"BAP\"),   which   affirmed.    Sheridan   v.

U.S. Dist. Ct. Local Rule (D.N.H.) 77.4(b) (“Pursuant to [Fed.\n\nR. Bankr.

P.\n\n83.”); (v) in all events, Administrative Order 2090-2, which was\n\nnot in effect at the time the bankruptcy court initiated the\n\nSheridan investigation, cannot be applied retroactively; and (vi)\n\nthe disciplinary power wielded by the bankruptcy court in the\n\ninstant case offends the doctrine of separation of powers, in that\n\nthe   bankruptcy   court   itself    thereby   assumes   the   inherently\n\nconflicting roles of accuser, investigator, prosecutor, and judge.\n\n\n\n      1\n      Bankruptcy Code § 105(a) provides, in pertinent part: “The\ncourt may issue any order, process, or judgment that is necessary\nor appropriate to carry out the provisions of this title.” 11\nU.S.C. § 105(a).\n\n                                    -4-\n\f            In the particular circumstances of the instant case, due\n\nto the fact that the BAP lacked appellate jurisdiction to address\n\nSheridan’s claims on the merits, the case must be remanded to the\n\nbankruptcy court for further proceedings.                We explain.\n\n            The    BAPs    are    authorized    to     review   only    the    “final\n\njudgments, orders and decrees” issued by the bankruptcy courts. 28\n\nU.S.C. § 158(b)(1), (a)(1).           Consequently, in the instant context\n\nthe dispositive jurisdictional issue is whether the disciplinary\n\norders   issued    by     the    bankruptcy    court    against      Sheridan    were\n\n“final.” See Stanley v.

If that decision was not a final order,\n\nthen the BAP's order also lacks finality.”).\n\n            The finality of a bankruptcy court order depends, inter\n\nalia,    upon   whether     the    proceeding    in     which   it     was    entered\n\nconstitutes a “core” or “non-core” proceeding.                        Although the\n\ndistrict court, as a tribunal established under Article III of the\n\nUnited    States    Constitution,       possesses       broad   jurisdiction       to\n\nadjudicate all proceedings which even tangentially “aris[e] under,”\n\nor are “related to,” a bankruptcy case [hereinafter: “related to”\n\nproceedings], the district court may opt to refer such cases or\n\nproceedings to the bankruptcy courts for hearing or adjudication.\n\nSee 28 U.S.C. § 157(a).          Of course, unlike the district court, the\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fbankruptcy court is established pursuant to Article I, rather than\n\nArticle      III,   and    its    jurisdiction         is    delimited      accordingly.\n\nAlthough the bankruptcy court may hear all “related-to” proceedings\n\nwhich have been referred to it, whether core or non-core, it may\n\nenter a final appealable judgment only if (i) the proceeding itself\n\nis   core,    viz.,   closely       intertwined        with       and   integral   to   the\n\nbankruptcy court’s mandate to administer a bankruptcy case; or (ii)\n\nthe case or proceeding is non-core, but the litigants nonetheless\n\nhave   consented      to    the    entry    of    a    final       disposition     by   the\n\nbankruptcy court, rather than by the district court.                        See Northern\n\nPipeline, 458 U.S. at 86-87.\n\n              If the proceeding is core, the bankruptcy court’s final\n\njudgment is immediately appealable either to the district court or,\n\nwith the      consent      of    the   parties,       to    the    BAP.     28   U.S.C.   §\n\n158(b)(1); § 157(b)(1). In either instance, the appellate tribunal\n\napplies a deferential standard of review to the bankruptcy court’s\n\nfindings of fact, and will upset those findings only if clearly\n\nerroneous.

Instead, after it has conducted the required\n\nproceedings, it must submit its proposed findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law for consideration by the district court. See 28\n\nU.S.C. § 157(c)(1); Cong. Credit Corp. v. AJC Int’l, Inc., 42 F.3d\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\f686, 690 (1st Cir. 1994).        The role of the district court in turn\n\nis to conduct de novo review of the findings of fact and the\n\nconclusions of law submitted by the bankruptcy court. In so doing,\n\nthe   district    court   may    receive   further     evidence,    modify   the\n\nfindings proposed by the bankruptcy court, and/or remand to the\n\nbankruptcy court with instructions. See Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9033(d).\n\nAt that stage, any appeal from the “final” district court order may\n\nbe taken only to the court of appeals, which applies a deferential\n\nstandard of review.

Consent\n\n          Before the bankruptcy court, Sheridan did not expressly\n\nconsent, either orally or in writing, to the treatment of his\n\nomnibus disciplinary proceeding as core.2   In In re G.S.F. Corp.,\n\n\n     2\n      The advisory committee note to Federal Rule of Bankruptcy\nProcedure 7008, which implements the statutory core/non-core\ndichotomy, provides:\n\n     Proceedings before a bankruptcy judge are either core or\n     non-core. 28 U.S.C. § 157. A bankruptcy judge may enter\n     a final order or judgment in a core proceeding. In a\n     non-core proceeding, absent consent of the parties, the\n     bankruptcy judge may not enter a final order or judgment\n     but may only submit proposed findings of fact and\n     conclusions of law to the district judge who will enter\n     the final order or judgment. 28 U.S.C. § 157(c)(1). The\n     amendment to subdivision (a) of this rule requires an\n     allegation as to whether a proceeding is core or\n     non-core. A party who alleges that the proceeding is\n\n                                -8-\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564956\"><a href=\"/opinion/564956/25-collier-bankrcas2d-113-bankr-l-rep-p-74130-in-re-gsf/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span>   <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>   <span class=\"page\">1467</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">   (1st    Cir.    1991),   we   decided   that   in   certain\n\ncircumstances, at least where the parties’ actions appear to speak\n\nas clearly as words, consent may be implied.          The actions deemed to\n\nhave evidenced “implied consent” in G.S.F. consisted of (i) the\n\nfiling of stipulations and releases by the parties “for entry as a\n\nfinal judgment” in the bankruptcy court, which stipulations and\n\nreleases     subsequently    were    incorporated    into   the    final   order\n\nwhereby the bankruptcy court dismissed the proceeding, and (ii) the\n\ndecision by the parties not to appeal from that “final” order.               Id.\n\nat 1477.     Thus, it was their affirmative and unambiguous conduct\n\nbefore the bankruptcy court – rather than their mere failure to\n\nrequest prior to judgment that the proceeding be declared non-core\n\n– which constituted the functional equivalent of the parties'\n\nexpress consent.     See infra note 5.\n\n             In contrast, Sheridan’s conduct did not unambiguously\n\nconnote consent, either to the bankruptcy court’s characterization\n\nof the proceeding as core or to its final adjudication of the\n\n\n      non-core shall state whether the party does or does not\n      consent to the entry of a final order or judgment by the\n      bankruptcy judge. Failure to include the statement of\n      consent does not constitute consent.       Only express\n      consent in the pleadings or otherwise is effective to\n      authorize entry of a final order or judgment by the\n      bankruptcy judge in a non-core proceeding. Amendments to\n      Rule 7012 require that the defendant admit or deny the\n      allegation as to whether the proceeding is core or\n      non-core.\n\nFed. R. Bankr. P. 7008 advisory committee’s note (1987) (emphasis\nadded).\n\n                                       -9-\n\fproceeding as non-core.    It is true that Sheridan did not suggest\n\nthat the proceeding was non-core until he submitted the post-\n\njudgment motion for reconsideration, cf. Santiago v. Canon U.S.A.,\n\nInc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197805\"><a href=\"/opinion/197805/santiago-etc-v-canon-usa-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 4 (1st Cir. 1998) (noting that party normally may\n\nnot raise new issues in post-judgment motion for reconsideration),\n\nbut the entry of the judgment was the first procedural juncture in\n\nthe bankruptcy proceeding in relation to which the core/none-core\n\nissue was broached.       Until then, it remained unclear how the\n\nbankruptcy court viewed its own jurisdiction.\n\n          To be sure, Sheridan could have elected to place the\n\nissue in contention sooner, but the failure to do so can bear no\n\ninference of consent.     When the district court refers a “related\n\nto” proceeding to the bankruptcy court, no presumption attaches\n\nthat the proceeding is core.      Indeed, the Rules of Bankruptcy\n\nProcedure, which serve to implement the statute itself, mandate\n\nthat the complaint contain a statement or allegation regarding\n\nwhether the proceeding is core or non-core, and if the latter,\n\nwhether the plaintiff consents to the entry of a final judgment by\n\nthe bankruptcy court.       See Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7008(a).      The\n\ncomplaint filed by Special Counsel failed to place the issue in\n\ncontention by alleging that the proceeding was core.      In cases\n\nwhere the plaintiff (e.g., Special Counsel Michels) has the burden\n\nto plead the core/non-core issue, and has chosen the bankruptcy\n\ncourt as her forum, her silence might connote consent.   See, e.g.,\n\n\n                                -10-\n\fHorwitz v. Alloy Auto. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"605628\"><a href=\"/opinion/605628/donald-a-horwitz-and-wesco-products-company-v-alloy-automotive-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">100</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 103 (7th Cir. 1993)\n\n(“Silence does not imply consent, but affirmatively invoking the\n\nbankruptcy court’s jurisdiction most assuredly supplies whatever\n\nconsent is necessary.”) (citations omitted). As Michels is not the\n\nappellant, and appellant Sheridan did not initiate the disciplinary\n\nproceeding, we need not address this issue.3\n\n            Similarly, Bankruptcy Rule 7012(b) prescribes that the\n\ndefendant’s answer “shall admit or deny an allegation that the\n\nproceeding    is   core   or   non-core,”   and   that   “[i]n   non-core\n\nproceedings[,] final orders and judgments shall not be entered on\n\nthe bankruptcy judge’s order except with the express consent of the\n\nparties.”    By implication, therefore, there was no need for the\n\nSheridan answer to challenge the core nature of the proceedings\n\n\n     3\n      The dissent relies upon various cases, some cited with\napproval in In re G.S.F., in which the specific issue involved\nconsent by a party – unlike Sheridan – who had invoked the\nbankruptcy court’s jurisdiction.

Our review reveals that Sheridan lumped together\n\na   host    of   jurisdictional     and     non-jurisdictional    challenges\n\npredicated upon the central premise that the bankruptcy court\n\nlacked any “authority” whatsoever to impose monetary sanctions as\n\na condition precedent to his reinstatement to the bar.            Given this\n\ncircumstance, therefore, we understand how the issue may have\n\neluded the BAP's attention.\n\n            Although it may be that Sheridan, had he been represented\n\nby counsel,7 would have advanced his argument more prominently and\n\ndistinctly than was done in his pro se submissions, we cannot\n\nfairly conclude that Sheridan failed either to raise the argument,\n\nor to discuss the criteria most pertinent to the core/non-core\n\nanalysis. For instance, in his motion for reconsideration Sheridan\n\nplainly contended:        “As such the Bankruptcy [C]ourt does not share\n\nall the powers of the district court. Thus in [Northern Pipeline],\n\nthe United States Supreme Court held that it was unconstitutional\n\nfor the Bankruptcy Courts to exercise the ‘essential attributes of\n\n\n     7\n      By way of bolstering its inference that Sheridan consented,\nthe dissenting opinion adverts to Sheridan as “an experienced\nbankruptcy attorney,” while failing to acknowledge that these\ndisciplinary proceedings arose, at least in part, from Sheridan’s\nnumerous physical ailments and mental impairments. The district\ncourt has yet to be accorded the opportunity to make the requisite\nfindings of fact on this issue.\n\n                                     -15-\n\fthe judicial power of the Article III district court,’ and that the\n\nbankruptcy court’s power was limited to ‘core proceedings’ of the\n\nadministration of the bankruptcy estate under the bankruptcy code,\n\n28 U.S.C. § 157(b)(1).” (Emphasis added; citations omitted.)\n\n           Not only is Northern Pipeline the seminal case on the\n\nconstitutional limitations which undergird the pivotal core/non-\n\ncore distinction, but the utter absence of a close nexus between\n\nthe Sheridan disciplinary proceeding and the administration of any\n\nparticular pending bankruptcy proceeding is a crucial consideration\n\nin resolving the core/non-core issue. See 28 U.S.C. § 157(b)(2)(A)\n\n(noting   that    core    proceedings    involve,    inter   alia,   “matters\n\nconcerning the administration of the estate”) (emphasis added);\n\ninfra   Section   II.C.      Moreover,    Sheridan    reiterated     the   same\n\nargument verbatim, both before the BAP and in the instant appeal,\n\nby relying upon the same citation to, and paraphrase of, the\n\nNorthern Pipeline holding, then adding: “The disciplinary order in\n\neach of the cases cited by the [BAP] arose out of and during the\n\nadministration of a single bankruptcy estate.” (Emphasis added.)\n\nThus, though Sheridan might have asserted the issue with somewhat\n\nmore prominence and clarity, we are hard-pressed to find, on these\n\nsubmissions, that the argument was conclusively forfeited.                 “[A]\n\ncourt should not lightly infer from a litigant's conduct consent to\n\nhave private state-created rights adjudicated by a non-Article III\n\nbankruptcy judge. Indeed, to do so would violate the spirit of\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\f[Northern Pipeline].” In re Men's Sportswear, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"498387\"><a href=\"/opinion/498387/bankr-l-rep-p-72126-in-re-mens-sportswear-inc-fka-claude-clement/\"><span class=\"volume\">834</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1134</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1138 (2d Cir. 1987).8\n\n          No   less   importantly,   even   in   the   event   we   were   to\n\nconclude that Sheridan forfeited the instant issue below, see\n\n\n\n     8\n      Nor can the Sheridan decision to appeal to the BAP, rather\nthan the district court, be deemed implied consent. Normally, a\nbankruptcy court decision in a non-core proceeding is not\nappealable to the BAP, but must be taken to the district court.\nHere, however, the bankruptcy court purportedly entered a decision\non the merits in what it termed a core proceeding, thereby\nrendering its judgment (unless vacated on appeal) final and\nappealable. See In re M.A. Baheth Constr. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"12708\"><a href=\"/opinion/12708/m-a-baheth-co-v-schott/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1082</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1084\n(5th Cir. 1997) (“Until and unless the determination of bankruptcy\ncourt jurisdiction is overturned, Baheth was bound to comply with\nthe court's judgment – and the procedural consequences thereof.”).\nAppeals from such a judgment lie either with the BAP or the\ndistrict court, sitting in its appellate capacity. See 28 U.S.C.\n§ 158(c)(1). Thus, either the BAP or the district court would have\njurisdiction   to   determine   whether   the  bankruptcy   court’s\ndesignation of the proceeding as core constituted reversible error.\n     We find equally enigmatic the related suggestion in the\ndissenting opinion that Sheridan expressly abandoned his objection\nto the bankruptcy court’s core treatment of the proceeding. In his\n15-page supplemental brief Sheridan vehemently disputes that he\never consented, asserting instead that he promptly raised the\ncore/non-core issue in his motion for reconsideration before the\nbankruptcy court. Michels, the party whose burden it was to allege\nthat the proceeding was core, declined our invitation to submit\nsupplemental briefing. Sheridan did note that he would “take[] no\nposition” on the non-core issue, but not because he conceded that\nit lacked merit, nor that it was not in his interest to pursue it.\nInstead, he noted that it was supported by “ample authority.” He\nbelieved (albeit incorrectly) that the jurisdictional issue became\nrelevant only if we were to find that the bankruptcy court had\nissued the sanction under Administrative Order 2090-2 only, and not\npursuant to Bankruptcy Code § 105.        This is a far cry from\nabandonment. Assuming that further evidence that Sheridan had not\nabandoned this claim was needed, however, his supplemental brief,\nin its final citation, points to In re BNI Telecommuns., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1841941\"><a href=\"/opinion/1841941/in-re-bn1-telecommunications-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">845</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 849 (B.A.P. 6th Cir. 2000), a case in which the Sixth Circuit\nreversed a bankruptcy court for improperly entering a final\njudgment in a non-core proceeding without appellant’s consent.\n\n                                 -17-\n\fMulvihill, 335 F.3d at 27, it is within our discretion to address\n\nan issue de novo, in those rare instances where the issue poses\n\n“purely a question of law; where addressing the merits promotes\n\njudicial economy as the same issue will likely be raised in other\n\ncases; and the claim raises an issue of constitutional magnitude,\n\nwhich if meritorious, could substantially affect the rights of\n\ncreditors and debtors in this and future bankruptcy proceedings.”\n\nIn re Weinstein, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198278\"><a href=\"/opinion/198278/patriot-portfolio-v-weinstein/\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">677</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 685 (1st Cir.)

The question as to whether the\n\nproceeding is core or non-core poses a pure question of law,\n\nsubject to plenary appellate review.       See In re Graves, 279 B.R. at\n\n270.   As    the   extended   procedural   travel   of   this   case   amply\n\ndemonstrates, the proper characterization, ab initio, of this type\n\nof omnibus disciplinary proceeding – as either core or non-core –\n\nis likely to minimize substantially the waste of judicial resources\n\nin future cases.    For example, had this proceeding been considered\n\nnon-core from the outset, the Sheridan appeals to the BAP and to\n\nthis court could not have occurred, the case would have proceeded\n\ndirectly to the district court to decide whether to adopt or reject\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\fthe recommended findings of fact and legal conclusions made by the\n\nbankruptcy court, and Sheridan may well have averted almost two\n\nyears of suspension from his professional livelihood.9\n\n           Finally,   the   core/non-core   distinction   advanced   in\n\nNorthern Pipeline unquestionably is one of constitutional import,\n\nin that it concerns the authority of an Article I court to enter a\n\nfinal judgment in a non-core proceeding absent the consent of the\n\nparties.   Thus, even assuming we were to conclude that Sheridan’s\n\npresentation of the core/non-core contention before the bankruptcy\n\ncourt and the BAP was inadequate, we would consider this case an\n\nappropriate one in which to conduct de novo review, rather than\n\nplain error review.10\n\n\n     9\n      The consequences of the core/non-core determination cannot\nfairly be understated. Thus, if the bankruptcy court decision were\nnot a final judgment, but merely a recommendation for entry of\njudgment, the Sheridan suspension from law practice would be\npremature, and could never have taken effect unless and until the\ndistrict court adopted the recommended decision entered by the\nbankruptcy court. Similarly, had the district court adopted the\nbankruptcy court recommendation, the issues upon which Sheridan\nmight base his appeal would be drastically altered. That is to\nsay, in that event the question would not be whether the bankruptcy\ncourt rules or administrative orders authorized this type of\nsanction, but whether the district court’s rules and orders\nauthorized such a sanction. See U.S. Dist. Ct. Local Rule (D.N.H.)\n83.5.\n     10\n      With respect, we must note that our dissenting colleague's\ndisapproval of our recourse to the La Guardia exception flows from\nseveral faulty premises. The dissent insists that Sheridan did not\nraise the core/non-core issue on appeal or if he did, inexplicably\nabandoned it after devoting several pages of supplemental briefing\nto a denial that he consented to core treatment. See supra note 8.\nThe dissent further states that the non-core issue is not one of\nconstitutional dimension. To the contrary, even the authorities\n\n                                 -19-\n\fC.   Core vs. Non-core\n\n            Notwithstanding    the    jurisdictional   issues    raised   by\n\nSheridan, see supra, the bankruptcy court failed to elaborate upon\n\nits rationale for ruling that the instant omnibus disciplinary\n\naction constitutes a core proceeding.        See 28 U.S.C. § 157(b)(3).\n\nGenerally    speaking,   a    proceeding    which   “arises     under”    the\n\nbankruptcy laws is considered core.         See 28 U.S.C. § 157(b)(1);\n\n\n\n\ncited by the dissent acknowledge that Northern Pipeline, which §\n157 purports to implement, involved a litigant’s constitutional\nright to have his case heard by an Article III court. See, e.g.,\nIn re Tex. Gen. Petroleum Corp., 52 F.3d at 1336 (“[Appellant’s\ncore/non-core] argument, however, is a constitutional one based on\nArticle III.   We must undertake the constitutional analysis.”).\nThe dissent then mischaracterizes our delineation of the factors\nwhich render this particular type of omnibus disciplinary\nproceeding non-core as involving a factual determination, whereas\nit is a purely legal determination as to what essential attributes\nof this proceeding satisfy the legal criteria set forth in §\n157(b)(2). See, e.g., In re Graves, 279 B.R. at 270 (noting that\nthe core/noncore determination is a question of law). The dissent\nfurther contends that the legal argument for characterizing the\nSheridan disciplinary proceeding as non-core is not compelling,\neven though the dissent cites no contrary authority directly on\npoint, and the Sheridan disciplinary proceeding meets none of the\ncriteria set forth in Bankruptcy Code § 157(b)(2).

One readily can envision, however, that an Article I court\n– once reassured that it is exercising its core authority – would\nbe hard put to resist the streamlined disciplinary procedures and\nfinality afforded by these proceedings.\n\n                                     -20-\n\fBoroff v.

First, it\nproposes the following syllogism:    (1) all non-core proceedings\ninvolve state contract claims, see Thomas v. Union Carbide Agric.\nProds. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">584</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1985); (2) the Sheridan disciplinary\nproceeding involved no such claim; and (3) consequently, the\nSheridan disciplinary proceeding is not a non-core proceeding. The\ninitial premise is flawed, however. Thomas simply describes its\nNorthern Pipeline holding, but does not announce that the Court\nwould forbear in future cases from extending the Northern Pipeline\nrationale to other types of analogous claims. Second, the dissent\ncites our decision in In re Arnold Print Works, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"485655\"><a href=\"/opinion/485655/16-collier-bankrcas2d-944-bankr-l-rep-p-71772-in-re-arnold-print/\"><span class=\"volume\">815</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">165</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1st Cir. 1987), for the proposition that attorney disciplinary\nactions against attorneys do not involve private contract-based\nrights, but “public rights” which non-Article III courts have\nalways been permitted to adjudicate. However, Arnold addresses the\nsomewhat arcane public rights doctrine, which describes a very\nnarrow category of claims of a sort which Article III courts are\ninstitutionally capable of adjudicating, but which historically\nwere resolved instead by legislative or administrative courts. See\nNorthern Pipeline, 458 U.S. at 67-68.

See Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9033(d) (empowering district court to\n\nreceive   further   evidence   before   deciding   whether   to   adopt\n\nbankruptcy court’s recommended decision).

In attempting to demonstrate that our reference\nto the state ethical rules is wholly “beside the point,” the\ndissent quotes Arnold Print Works, 815 F.2d at 169,       where we\nstated that “[i]t is the nature of the proceeding – its relation to\na basic function of the bankruptcy court – not the federal or state\nbasis for the claim, that makes the difference here.” (Emphasis\nadded.)    The quoted statement plainly does not support the\ndissent’s contention that the primacy of state law can never be\nweighed as a factor in the core/non-core analysis; and were there\nto be any doubt, we further observed that “the fact that a\nbankruptcy matter raises issues of state, rather than federal, law\ndoes not by itself determine that it is non-core, rather than\ncore.” Id.

Although we need not resolve the issue today, a\nstrong argument could be made that § 157(b) contemplates that\nattorney discipline imposed in the midst of an ongoing case\nadministration would be a core proceeding, even if the attorney’s\nconduct itself occurred during a non-core proceeding, precisely\nbecause the discipline concerns the administration of the estate\nand the prospects that the bankruptcy court will be able to bring\nthe case to successful conclusion.        In those circumstances,\nimmediate discipline serves the purpose of expedition, rather than\nthwarting it.\n     Throughout, the dissent inexplicably describes our non-core\ntreatment of an omnibus disciplinary proceeding as a “penalty,”\nwhich the bankruptcy courts will scurry to avoid at all costs, even\nif it means the tedious reopening of each constituent case, or the\nmanipulation of the form of a disciplinary proceeding in a single\nbankruptcy case so as to introduce in evidence attorney misconduct\narising in the other unrelated cases. In re Ludwick, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1939150\"><a href=\"/opinion/1939150/in-re-ludwick/\"><span class=\"volume\">185</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(Bankr. S.D. Mich. 1995), however, clearly was not an attempt to\nmanipulate the form of a disciplinary proceeding to avoid a non-\ncore designation. The bankruptcy attorney was accused of forging\none client’s (i.e., Ludwick’s) signature.      During disciplinary\nhearings, a second client of the attorney in an unrelated\nbankruptcy case testified that the attorney had also forged his\nsignature. The court sanctioned the attorney only to compensate\nLudwick for the Ludwick forgery, not the other forgery. Id. at 244\n(noting that court used evidence of second forgery only on the\nissue of the attorney’s credibility in denying the Ludwick\nforgery).\n     We can perceive no sound basis for the curious conclusion that\nthe bankruptcy courts would be unreasonably covetous of the power\nto issue a final disciplinary order, rather than a recommendatory\ndecision subject to de novo review by the district court.       The\nmutual goal of the bankruptcy courts and the district courts alike\nis the deterrence of attorney misconduct.            Thus, omnibus\nproceedings are – and will remain – an efficient means to\ninvestigate attorney conduct spanning dozens of bankruptcy cases,\nas well as a viable option for the bankruptcy courts following our\ndecision.\n\n                               -28-\n\fperiod of time, the alleged misconduct may have occurred either\n\nbefore multiple bankruptcy judges in a multi-judge district, or\n\nentirely or partially outside the presence of the bankruptcy judge\n\nwho   hears    the    disciplinary         case.        Here,        for    instance,    the\n\nbankruptcy     court       appointed      Michels     to       investigate       Sheridan’s\n\nconduct, much of which allegedly occurred outside the courtroom. In\n\nsuch cases, the bankruptcy judge would seem to have no greater\n\nexpertise as a factfinder than the district court.\n\n              We do not question that the case law overwhelmingly\n\nsuggests      that    the    bankruptcy       court     possesses          the    requisite\n\nauthority, either inherent or statutory, to regulate its bar as\n\nnecessary and appropriate.                See supra note 1.                Nor do we hold\n\notherwise.      In the instant case, however, the bankruptcy court\n\nexercised     its    authority       to   take     disciplinary            action   against\n\nSheridan,      and    we    simply     hold      that      —    in    these      particular\n\ncircumstances — the bankruptcy court was not empowered to arrive at\n\na final resolution of the disciplinary matter absent further\n\ndistrict court participation and oversight.\n\n              The requirement that the district court arrive at a\n\nfinal, plenary disciplinary disposition further recognizes that\n\ndisbarment and suspension plainly are among the more grievous\n\nsanctions     which    can    be   imposed.         Thus,       the    imposition       of   a\n\n$30,377.50 fine, as a condition precedent to readmission to the\n\nbar, is onerous indeed; the more so in the present circumstances\n\n\n                                           -29-\n\fwhere numerous ethical violations spanning numerous bankruptcy\n\ncases were conglomerated into a single disciplinary proceeding\n\nafter the fact.

Thus, had the Sheridan ethical violations occurred either\n\nduring the course of a bankruptcy case or within the immediate\n\npresence of the bankruptcy judge, or otherwise directly affected\n\nthe administration,         liquidation,        or   reorganization         efforts,    a\n\nstronger    demonstration        might    be    made    for    characterizing        the\n\ndisciplinary proceeding as a core matter.                       See, e.g., In re\n\nHessinger, 192 B.R. at 220 (noting that within an individual\n\nbankruptcy case a suspension or disbarment of counsel may more\n\nreadily be regarded as “affecting” asset liquidation, inasmuch as\n\ndisqualification       of    counsel     normally       affects      entitlement       to\n\n\n                                         -31-\n\fattorney fees recoverable from the bankrupt estate, or requires\n\nreimbursement   of   attorney   fees   previously   received,   hence\n\nincreasing the assets available for distribution).    As the instant\n\ncase implicates no such considerations, however, we reserve that\n\nmatter for another day.\n\n          In summary, the case at bar is distinguishable due\n\nprincipally to the following factors:     (i) the omnibus nature of\n\nthe disciplinary proceeding; (ii) the case did not arise in the\n\ncontext of an ongoing bankruptcy case, cf.

Accordingly, the case must be remanded\n\nto the bankruptcy court for entry of its recommended findings of\n\nfact and conclusions of law, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 157(c)(1).\n\nThe instant dismissal is not to be interpreted as reflecting our\n\n\n                                -32-\n\fviews on the underlying merits of the Sheridan appeal or the\n\nauthority of the district court, vel non, to impose monetary\n\nsanctions as a condition precedent to Sheridan's readmission to the\n\nbar following the type of omnibus disciplinary proceeding conducted\n\nhere.\n\n           Accordingly, pending the entry of a final judgment by the\n\ndistrict court, based upon the recommended findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law entered by the bankruptcy court, Sheridan is\n\nreinstated to the bankruptcy court bar immediately. See supra note\n\n9.   Our decision shall be without prejudice to the right of a party\n\nto appeal from any district court order that finally disposes of\n\nthe recommended findings of fact and conclusions of law entered by\n\nthe bankruptcy court.\n\n           The BAP decision and the bankruptcy court decision are\n\nhereby vacated for want of jurisdiction.        Sheridan is hereby\n\nreinstated to the bankruptcy court bar, and the case is remanded to\n\nthe bankruptcy court for further proceedings consistent with this\n\nopinion. The parties are to bear their own costs.    SO ORDERED.\n\n\n\n                   - Concurring Opinion Follows -\n\n\n\n\n                                -33-\n\f          SELYA, Circuit Judge (concurring in the judgment).     I\n\nrecognize that the appellant did not make his jurisdictional\n\nargument with crystalline clarity, either to the BAP or in this\n\ncourt.   There are, however, extenuating circumstances, and in my\n\nview the LaGuardia/Weinstein exception is available here.     I am\n\ncomfortable in joining in the affirmative exercise of discretion\n\nneeded to invoke that exception, and, thus, reaching the important\n\nissue of classification (core versus non-core) that permeates this\n\nproceeding. While that issue is not free from doubt, my resolution\n\nof it tracks Judge Cyr's:   this omnibus disciplinary proceeding,\n\nwhich did not arise out of any matter(s) directly affecting the\n\nbankruptcy court's ability to administer one or more ongoing cases,\n\nis a non-core proceeding.     Consequently, the bankruptcy court\n\nlacked the authority to enter a final judgment.\n\n          I therefore concur in the vacation of the improvidently\n\nentered judgment and the concomitant remand.    If the appellant's\n\nconduct is deserving of discipline beyond the period of enforced\n\nsuspension that he already has experienced — a matter on which I\n\ntake no view — it is the district court which, in the circumstances\n\nof this proceeding, must impose it.\n\n\n\n                  - Dissenting Opinion Follows -\n\n\n\n\n                               -34-\n\f</pre>",
