Keisler, Assistant Attorney General, Phyllis J.\nPyles, Director, Torts Branch, and Matthew L. Zabel, Deputy\nAssociate Attorney General, United States Department of Justice.\n\n\n                             March 22, 2005\n\f             Per Curiam.     Appellant, Nicolas Nogueras-Cartagena,\n\nfiled two lawsuits based largely on the same nexus of fact: an\n\nearlier suit, the dismissal of which we affirmed in Nogueras-\n\nCartagena v. United States Dept. of Justice, 75 Fed. Appx. 795, 798\n\n(1st Cir. 2003) (per curiam) (Nogueras-Cartegena I), and a later\n\nsuit, the dismissal of which is now before us on appeal.        The\n\ndifferences between this and the earlier case are few.\n\n             In the earlier case, appellant sought money damages\n\npursuant to the Federal Tort Claims Act (\"FTCA\"), 28 U.S.C. §§\n\n1346(b) & 2671-80, and Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed.\n\nBureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), from the United States\n\nand several individuals, including a United States Attorney, a\n\nFederal Bureau of Investigation agent, an Internal Revenue Service\n\nagent, and two Assistant United States Attorneys.    Here, appellant\n\nagain seeks money damages from the United States and various\n\nindividuals pursuant to the FTCA and Bivens1, but he has also filed\n\nclaims pursuant to 26 U.S.C. § 7433 for improper tax collection.\n\nMoreover, the individual defendants have, for the most part,\n\nchanged; as they now are five IRS employees, only one of whom was\n\nnamed in the prior civil action.2\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      We note that appellant has not adequately raised any argument\non appeal with respect to the dismissal of his Bivens claims, and\nwe therefore do not further consider the Bivens claims.\n     2\n         Jose E. Gonzalez was named in the earlier case.\n\n                                  -2-\n\f                                 BACKGROUND\n\n            The    following    is    a    brief     summary      of    appellant's\n\nallegations, which must be accepted as true for the purposes of\n\nthis appeal.      TAG/ICIB Servs., Inc. v. Pan Am Grain Co., Inc., 215\n\nF.3d 172, 175 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n            The    earlier    case   arose      in   the   wake    of    the   failed\n\nprosecution of appellant, then a prominent politician in Puerto\n\nRico, on charges relating to tax fraud and violations of the Ethics\n\nin Government Act.        After the government had given up on the\n\nprosecution,      the   IRS    allegedly        negligently       and    maliciously\n\npersisted in attempting to collect taxes from appellant. Appellant\n\nbases the instant lawsuit upon both the failed prosecution and the\n\ntax     collection.      On    January     4,     2000,    appellant      filed    an\n\nadministrative claim with the IRS.           Less than six months later, on\n\nJune 21, 2000, he filed a complaint in the United States District\n\nCourt for the District of Puerto Rico, thereby commencing the\n\nearlier federal court case.\n\n            On October 30, 2000, the IRS denied the administrative\n\nclaim.\n\n            After filing the earlier federal court case, but prior to\n\nits dismissal, appellant commenced the instant federal court case\n\nby filing a separate complaint in the district court on February 8,\n\n2002.     The following week, he filed motions in both cases to\n\nconsolidate the instant case with the earlier one.                      The district\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fcourt judge assigned to the earlier case (Dominguez, J.), denied\n\nthe motion.    The earlier case would be dismissed with prejudice\n\nlater that year.\n\n            On April 25, 2002, the United States moved to dismiss the\n\ninstant case for lack of jurisdiction and for failure to state a\n\nclaim, and it moved to substitute itself as a party for the\n\nindividual defendants.      On June 20, 2002, the district court\n\ngranted the motion to substitute and terminated the individuals as\n\nparties.    On July 7, 2002, appellant filed an opposition to the\n\nmotion to dismiss.   On April 10, 2003, the United States replied to\n\nthe opposition.    On March 31, 2004, the district court dismissed\n\nthe case.    Thereafter, appellant filed a timely notice of appeal.\n\n                              DISCUSSION\n\n            The issues here are purely legal, so we review them de\n\nnovo.    Gonzalez v. United States, 284 F.3d 281, 287 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).\n\n            As in Nogueras-Cartegena I, \"[w]e have carefully perused\n\nthe record and find no reason to disturb the district court's\n\nrulings\" and affirm substantially on the basis of the district\n\ncourt's opinion--Nogueras-Cartagena v. United States, 321 F. Supp.\n\n2d 265 (D.P.R. Mar. 31, 2004)--adding only a few brief comments.\n\n75 Fed. Appx. at 797.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f          A.     The FTCA Claims\n\n          First, we conclude the district court correctly dismissed\n\nthe FTCA claims, but we add the following to respond to two\n\nalternative    arguments   the   district   court   did   not   address.\n\nNogueras-Cartagena, 321 F. Supp. 2d 270-71.\n\n          First, appellant argues, as he did below, that we should\n\nconsider the filing of his earlier federal court case, rather than\n\nthe filing of this federal court case, as the basis for satisfying\n\nthe procedural requirement that a tort claim against the United\n\nStates shall be forever barred unless a suit is filed in federal\n\ncourt3 \"within six months after the date of mailing . . . of notice\n\nof final denial of the claim by the agency to which it was\n\npresented.\"    28 U.S.C. § 2401(b) (2000); Gonzalez-Bernal v. United\n\nStates, 907 F.2d 246, 248 (1st Cir. 1990).           To be sure, the\n\ndistrict court correctly concluded that the instant federal court\n\ncase was begun well after section 2401(b)'s six-month deadline; as\n\nthe administrative claim was denied on October 30, 2000, and the\n\nfederal court case was filed on February 8, 2002.               Nogueras-\n\nCartagena, 321 F. Supp. 2d at 270-71.        Appellant argues in the\n\nalternative, however, that the instant federal court case should\n\nrelate back to the filing of his earlier federal court case on June\n\n21, 2000, which he contends would satisfy section 2401(b).             As\n\n\n\n     3\n      As a shorthand for the suit filed in the federal court, we\nare here using the term \"federal court case.\"\n\n                                   -5-\n\fappellant's reliance on this earlier filing is misplaced, we need\n\nnot decide whether, generally speaking, an entirely different\n\nfederal court case could satisfy the requirements of section\n\n2401(b).\n\n            We held in Nogueras-Cartagena I that the filing of this\n\nearlier    federal    court   case,    itself,   ran   afoul   of   statutory\n\nrequirements.        75 Fed. Appx. at 797.        In addition to section\n\n2401(b), tort claims against the government are subject to 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2675(a), which provides that one must either await final\n\ndenial of a claim by an administrative agency or must wait for six\n\nmonths    after   the    filing   of   the   administrative    claim   before\n\ninstituting a tort claim against the United States by filing a\n\nfederal court case. We concluded that appellant failed to meet the\n\nrequirements of section 2675(a) because he filed his federal court\n\ncase approximately five months and two weeks after he filed the\n\nadministrative claim but before final denial of the administrative\n\nclaim by the IRS.       Nogueras-Cartagena I, 75 Fed. Appx. at 797.\n\n            This prior holding illustrates appellant is pressing a\n\nnon sequitur, as he attempts to render the current filing proper by\n\nhaving it stand in the shoes of an earlier improper filing.             That\n\nis, even if his reliance upon the filing of the earlier federal\n\ncourt case would survive section 2401(b), it would run afoul of\n\nsection 2675(a).        Accordingly, the argument does not advance his\n\ncause, and we reject it.\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f          Second, we address appellant's argument that he did not\n\nreceive \"final denial\" of his administrative claim pursuant to\n\nsection 2675(a) until the IRS issued a \"final determination of the\n\nadministrative claim\" on January 9, 2002.      Accordingly, he argues,\n\nJanuary 9, 2002 should serve as the date upon which to begin the\n\nsix-month limitations period, and therefore the filing of his\n\ncomplaint on February 8, 2002 would have been timely. As appellant\n\nfailed to raise this argument below, it is forfeited.         Teamsters,\n\nChauffeurs,   Warehousemen   and   Helpers   Union,   Local   No.   59   v.\n\nSuperline Transp. Co., 953 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"If any\n\nprinciple is settled in this circuit, it is that, absent the most\n\nextraordinary circumstances, legal theories not raised squarely in\n\nthe lower court cannot be broached for the first time on appeal.\").\n\n          Even had he preserved the argument for appeal, it would\n\nnot have been successful.      The so-called \"final determination\"\n\n(actually entitled \"Notice of Determination Concerning Collection\n\nAction(s) Under Section 6320 and/or 6330\") does not have anything\n\nto do with appellant's administrative claim, which appellant used\n\nto commence the earlier lawsuit for alleged torts committed by the\n\nfederal government and its agents in connection with the failed\n\ncriminal prosecution of appellant.       Rather, the notice indicates\n\nmerely that the IRS had reached a determination concerning whether\n\nthe lien and levy on appellant was appropriate for the efficient\n\n\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fcollection of taxes.       Thus, it cannot be considered \"final denial\"\n\nof his administrative claim pursuant to section 2675(a).\n\n          B.        The Section 7433 Claims\n\n          Second, we conclude the district court properly dismissed\n\nthe section 7433 claims for wrongful tax collection.                   Nogueras-\n\nCartagena,    321    F.   Supp.    2d    at    271-72.    The    district   court\n\napparently concluded that appellant's wrongful tax collection suit\n\nwas more appropriately a suit for wrongful tax assessment and\n\ntherefore evaluated whether appellant met the filing guidelines for\n\nwrongful tax assessment claims.                Id.   The court concluded that\n\nsince appellant failed to fulfill the jurisdictional requirements\n\nfor wrongful assessment claims (which require the filing of a\n\nrefund and the payment of the assessment before bringing suit), his\n\nclaim should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.                See 26 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 7422(a) & (g)(1)(A).           Appellant maintains, however, that his\n\nsuit is for wrongful collection.              We write here only to dispel any\n\ncontention that the result would be any different had his claims\n\nbeen accepted as claims for wrongful tax collection.\n\n             Much like FTCA claims, section 7433 claims may only be\n\nbrought   after      exhaustion     of    administrative        remedies.     The\n\nexhaustion requirements under section 7433 are governed by 26\n\nC.F.R. § 301.7433-1.       Among these requirements are that claimants\n\nmark their claims with attention to particular individuals and\n\nidentify the grounds for relief, the injuries incurred, and the\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fdollar value of each claim.       26 C.F.R. § 301.7433-1(e).               There is\n\nno    indication    that   appellant   has    complied      with    these    filing\n\nguidelines.      There is no copy of the administrative claim in the\n\nrecord4,   and     appellant   fails   in    his    brief    to    discuss    these\n\nrequirements at all.       Indeed, the district court stated that it is\n\n\"undisputed\" that appellant has not met the prerequisites of\n\nsection 7433.       Accordingly, he has not established jurisdiction,\n\nand the complaint was properly dismissed. Murphy v. United States,\n\n45 F.3d 520, 522 (1st Cir. 1995) (stating, \"the party invoking the\n\njurisdiction of a federal court[,] carries the burden of proving\n\nits   existence\");     Nogueras-Cartagena      I,    75     Fed.   Appx.     at   798\n\n(failure to exhaust administrative remedies is a jurisdictional\n\ndefect).\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      We note that we were able to retrieve a copy of the\nadministrative claim from the record of Nogueras-Cartagena I.\nHaving reviewed it, we conclude it concerns only the alleged torts\ncommitted in connection with the government's failed prosecution of\nappellant and therefore does not support the wrongful tax\ncollection claims.\n\n                                       -9-\n\f",

United States, 321 F. Supp.\n\n2d 265 (D.P.R. Mar. 31, 2004)--adding only a few brief comments.\n\n75 Fed. Appx. at 797.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f          A.     The FTCA Claims\n\n          First, we conclude the district court correctly dismissed\n\nthe FTCA claims, but we add the following to respond to two\n\nalternative    arguments   the   district   court   did   not   address.\n\nNogueras-Cartagena, 321 F. Supp. 2d 270-71.\n\n          First, appellant argues, as he did below, that we should\n\nconsider the filing of his earlier federal court case, rather than\n\nthe filing of this federal court case, as the basis for satisfying\n\nthe procedural requirement that a tort claim against the United\n\nStates shall be forever barred unless a suit is filed in federal\n\ncourt3 \"within six months after the date of mailing . . . of notice\n\nof final denial of the claim by the agency to which it was\n\npresented.\"    28 U.S.C. § 2401(b) (2000); Gonzalez-Bernal v. United\n\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"544228\"><a href=\"/opinion/544228/carmen-delia-gonzalez-bernal-etc-v-united-states-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">907</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">246</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 248 (1st Cir. 1990).           To be sure, the\n\ndistrict court correctly concluded that the instant federal court\n\ncase was begun well after section 2401(b)'s six-month deadline; as\n\nthe administrative claim was denied on October 30, 2000, and the\n\nfederal court case was filed on February 8, 2002.               Nogueras-\n\nCartagena, 321 F. Supp. 2d at 270-71.        Appellant argues in the\n\nalternative, however, that the instant federal court case should\n\nrelate back to the filing of his earlier federal court case on June\n\n21, 2000, which he contends would satisfy section 2401(b).             As\n\n\n\n     3\n      As a shorthand for the suit filed in the federal court, we\nare here using the term \"federal court case.\"\n\n                                   -5-\n\fappellant's reliance on this earlier filing is misplaced, we need\n\nnot decide whether, generally speaking, an entirely different\n\nfederal court case could satisfy the requirements of section\n\n2401(b).\n\n            We held in Nogueras-Cartagena I that the filing of this\n\nearlier    federal    court   case,    itself,   ran   afoul   of   statutory\n\nrequirements.        75 Fed. Appx. at 797.        In addition to section\n\n2401(b), tort claims against the government are subject to 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2675(a), which provides that one must either await final\n\ndenial of a claim by an administrative agency or must wait for six\n\nmonths    after   the    filing   of   the   administrative    claim   before\n\ninstituting a tort claim against the United States by filing a\n\nfederal court case. We concluded that appellant failed to meet the\n\nrequirements of section 2675(a) because he filed his federal court\n\ncase approximately five months and two weeks after he filed the\n\nadministrative claim but before final denial of the administrative\n\nclaim by the IRS.       Nogueras-Cartagena I, 75 Fed. Appx. at 797.\n\n            This prior holding illustrates appellant is pressing a\n\nnon sequitur, as he attempts to render the current filing proper by\n\nhaving it stand in the shoes of an earlier improper filing.             That\n\nis, even if his reliance upon the filing of the earlier federal\n\ncourt case would survive section 2401(b), it would run afoul of\n\nsection 2675(a).        Accordingly, the argument does not advance his\n\ncause, and we reject it.\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f          Second, we address appellant's argument that he did not\n\nreceive \"final denial\" of his administrative claim pursuant to\n\nsection 2675(a) until the IRS issued a \"final determination of the\n\nadministrative claim\" on January 9, 2002.      Accordingly, he argues,\n\nJanuary 9, 2002 should serve as the date upon which to begin the\n\nsix-month limitations period, and therefore the filing of his\n\ncomplaint on February 8, 2002 would have been timely. As appellant\n\nfailed to raise this argument below, it is forfeited.         Teamsters,\n\nChauffeurs,   Warehousemen   and   Helpers   Union,   Local   No.   59   v.\n\nSuperline Transp. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"575211\"><a href=\"/opinion/575211/teamsters-chauffeurs-warehousemen-and-helpers-union-local-no-59-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 21 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"If any\n\nprinciple is settled in this circuit, it is that, absent the most\n\nextraordinary circumstances, legal theories not raised squarely in\n\nthe lower court cannot be broached for the first time on appeal.\").\n\n          Even had he preserved the argument for appeal, it would\n\nnot have been successful.      The so-called \"final determination\"\n\n(actually entitled \"Notice of Determination Concerning Collection\n\nAction(s) Under Section 6320 and/or 6330\") does not have anything\n\nto do with appellant's administrative claim, which appellant used\n\nto commence the earlier lawsuit for alleged torts committed by the\n\nfederal government and its agents in connection with the failed\n\ncriminal prosecution of appellant.       Rather, the notice indicates\n\nmerely that the IRS had reached a determination concerning whether\n\nthe lien and levy on appellant was appropriate for the efficient\n\n\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fcollection of taxes.       Thus, it cannot be considered \"final denial\"\n\nof his administrative claim pursuant to section 2675(a).\n\n          B.        The Section 7433 Claims\n\n          Second, we conclude the district court properly dismissed\n\nthe section 7433 claims for wrongful tax collection.                   Nogueras-\n\nCartagena,    321    F.   Supp.    2d    at    271-72.    The    district   court\n\napparently concluded that appellant's wrongful tax collection suit\n\nwas more appropriately a suit for wrongful tax assessment and\n\ntherefore evaluated whether appellant met the filing guidelines for\n\nwrongful tax assessment claims.                Id.   The court concluded that\n\nsince appellant failed to fulfill the jurisdictional requirements\n\nfor wrongful assessment claims (which require the filing of a\n\nrefund and the payment of the assessment before bringing suit), his\n\nclaim should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.                See 26 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 7422(a) & (g)(1)(A).           Appellant maintains, however, that his\n\nsuit is for wrongful collection.              We write here only to dispel any\n\ncontention that the result would be any different had his claims\n\nbeen accepted as claims for wrongful tax collection.\n\n             Much like FTCA claims, section 7433 claims may only be\n\nbrought   after      exhaustion     of    administrative        remedies.     The\n\nexhaustion requirements under section 7433 are governed by 26\n\nC.F.R. § 301.7433-1.       Among these requirements are that claimants\n\nmark their claims with attention to particular individuals and\n\nidentify the grounds for relief, the injuries incurred, and the\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fdollar value of each claim.       26 C.F.R. § 301.7433-1(e).               There is\n\nno    indication    that   appellant   has    complied      with    these    filing\n\nguidelines.      There is no copy of the administrative claim in the\n\nrecord4,   and     appellant   fails   in    his    brief    to    discuss    these\n\nrequirements at all.       Indeed, the district court stated that it is\n\n\"undisputed\" that appellant has not met the prerequisites of\n\nsection 7433.       Accordingly, he has not established jurisdiction,\n\nand the complaint was properly dismissed. Murphy v.
