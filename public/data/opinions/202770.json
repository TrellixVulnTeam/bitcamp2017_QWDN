Defendant-appellant Omar Rivera-\n\nRodríguez (“Rivera-Rodríguez”) appeals from his sentence of 121\n\nmonths imprisonment for conspiracy to possess with intent to\n\ndistribute controlled substances in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 846\n\nand 841(a)(1).        Finding his assignments of error to be without\n\nmerit, we affirm Rivera-Rodríguez’s sentence.\n\n                                               I.\n\n     Rivera-Rodríguez          was        a     member        of   a    drug-trafficking\n\norganization       that     sold    cocaine,          crack    cocaine,     heroin,   and\n\nmarijuana at “drug points” in and around Guayama, Puerto Rico.                          On\n\nSeptember 26, 2002, following a two-year investigation by federal\n\nand local law enforcement agencies, a federal grand jury returned\n\na two-count indictment against Rivera-Rodríguez and forty-two co-\n\ndefendants.         Count    One    of     the       indictment    alleged    that    from\n\napproximately April 28, 1993, to September 26, 2002, the defendants\n\nconspired     to    possess        with        intent    to    distribute     controlled\n\nsubstances     in     violation           of     21     U.S.C.     §§    841(a)(1)    and\n\n841(b)(1)(A).1\n\n     According to the indictment, Rivera-Rodríguez supplied heroin\n\nand cocaine to the drug-trafficking organization.                          He is one of\n\nonly two suppliers identified in the indictment.                         At a detention\n\nhearing on October 11, 2002, the government described Rivera-\n\n\n     1\n      Count Two (a property forfeiture charge) was dismissed as to\nRivera-Rodríguez and, consequently, is not a subject of this\nappeal.\n\n                                               -2-\n\fRodríguez’s role in the conspiracy as “significant.”              When asked\n\nabout the quantity of drugs he had supplied to the organization at\n\nany given time, the government responded that:\n\n     [Rivera-Rodríguez] has been involved since approximately\n     1992 or 1993 and . . . he has supplied kilogram\n     quantities, perhaps not one kilo each time there’s a drug\n     transaction, perhaps half a kilo quantities, perhaps\n     quarter of a kilo or eighth of a kilo quantities. But\n     we’re not talking grams here.     We’re talking kilo or\n     portion of kilo quantities of both cocaine and heroin.\n\n     At a bail review hearing on January 29, 2003, the government\n\nagain characterized Rivera-Rodríguez’s role in the conspiracy as\n\n“substantial” and “significant.”         The government described Rivera-\n\nRodríguez as a “major cocaine supplier” and informed the magistrate\n\njudge   that   it   had   three   or   four   witnesses   who   had   provided\n\ninformation that Rivera-Rodríguez was a “main supplier to the\n\norganization.”      The government indicated that Rivera-Rodríguez was\n\n“involved in the upper echelons of the organization,” and that he\n\nhad delegated authority to others to make transactions on his\n\nbehalf. The government also introduced an organizational chart and\n\nasserted that Rivera-Rodríguez acted as the “right hand” of the\n\nleader of the organization.\n\n     On July 15, 2003, Rivera-Rodríguez pleaded guilty pursuant to\n\na plea agreement with the government.             The parties agreed that\n\nRivera-Rodríguez would be held responsible for 3.5 to 5 kilograms\n\nof cocaine, which yielded a base offense level of 30 under U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2D1.1(c)(5).      The parties also stipulated that Rivera-Rodríguez\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fwould receive a two-level increase for his role in the offense as\n\n“an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor” pursuant to U.S.S.G.\n\n§   3B1.1(c),      and   a    two-level   decrease       for   his    acceptance     of\n\nresponsibility under U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1.\n\n      The parties anticipated a Criminal History Category of I,\n\nmaking the applicable sentencing range 97 to 121 months.                      Although\n\nthe plea agreement warned Rivera-Rodríguez that his sentence was\n\n“within the sound discretion of the sentencing judge,” the parties\n\nagreed      that   the       government   would    recommend         121    months   of\n\nincarceration, while Rivera-Rodríguez would request 97 months.\n\n      The     presentence        report   (“PSR”)        adopted     the     guideline\n\ncalculations agreed to by the parties in the plea agreement.2                        The\n\nPSR   described     Rivera-Rodríguez        as    “the    cocaine     and    marihuana\n\nsupplier to the organization.”             Notably, the PSR stated that, as\n\none of the suppliers to the drug-trafficking organization, Rivera-\n\nRodríguez was “more culpable” than those members of the conspiracy\n\nwho sold the narcotics.          The PSR also noted that under the terms of\n\nthe plea agreement, Rivera-Rodríguez had “pled guilty in exchange\n\nfor the stipulation of a lesser drug amount.”\n\n      At the sentencing hearing on November 7, 2003, the court\n\naccepted the guideline calculations agreed to by the parties and\n\n\n      2\n       Although not contemplated in the plea agreement, the PSR\nalso included a two-level increase to Rivera-Rodríguez’s base\noffense level for possession of a firearm under U.S.S.G. §\n2D1.1(b)(1).     Rivera-Rodríguez objected, however, and the\nenhancement was eventually removed from the PSR.\n\n                                          -4-\n\fadopted by the PSR.        Defense counsel asked the court to sentence\n\nRivera-Rodríguez to the low-end of the guideline range, or 97\n\nmonths.   In support of this request for a sentence at the low-end\n\nof the guideline range, defense counsel noted that Rivera-Rodríguez\n\nhad a long-term, stable marriage and a six-year-old daughter.\n\nCounsel   also    argued   that,   despite   having   only   a   ninth   grade\n\neducation, Rivera-Rodríguez had worked as a land surveyor, and had\n\nowned and operated a small grocery store since 2000.                 Defense\n\ncounsel informed the court that she had information that a witness\n\nat the trial of several of Rivera-Rodríguez’s co-defendants had\n\n“testified to the fact that after [Rivera-Rodríguez] engaged in his\n\n[grocery] business, he withdrew from the conspiracy.”\n\n     In arguing for the low-end of the guideline range, defense\n\ncounsel also asserted that the pre-trial discovery provided by the\n\ngovernment showed that Rivera-Rodríguez was only a “peripheral\n\nsupplier.”       Defense counsel stated that “the evidence against\n\n[Rivera-Rodríguez] consisted of two or three witnesses saying that\n\nhe had supplied 8ths and 4ths [of a kilogram], and that is the\n\nreason why the quantity of 3.5 to 5 kilograms of cocaine was\n\nstipulated [to] in the plea agreement.”\n\n     In closing, defense counsel observed that Rivera-Rodríguez was\n\na first-time offender and had shown a willingness to rehabilitate.\n\nShe also noted that he “was one of the first defendants to come\n\nforward and accept his responsibility.”               Accordingly, defense\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fcounsel asked the court to consider a sentence at the low-end of\n\nthe guideline range.\n\n     The government, on the other hand, asked the court to sentence\n\nRivera-Rodríguez to the high-end of the guideline range.          The\n\ngovernment stated:\n\n     As [y]our Honor knows well, having presided over the\n     [two] month trial [of several co-defendants], there were\n     numerous drug points, between Guayama and Salinas, at\n     least ten. The drugs had to come from somewhere, [y]our\n     Honor, I believe the court heard testimony that there\n     were numerous sources, one being one of the defendants\n     that stood trial and one being the man that stands here\n     before you. . . . I submit that the testimony, [pre-trial\n     discovery], and all [of] the evidence that the government\n     has and presented at trial indicates that were this\n     defendant to go to trial, the government would be seeking\n     a [base offense] level [of] 38 to start with. In this\n     case we are seeking a much lower amount.\n\n          There    were quantities frankly beyond the amount\n     stipulated   in the plea agreement and I submit that the\n     government   is bound by the plea agreement to recommend a\n     maximum of    121 months . . . I would ask the court to\n     impose the   sentence that the government now recommends.\n\nDefense counsel countered that the quantity of drugs that had been\n\nstipulated to in the plea agreement was based on the pre-trial\n\ndiscovery she had received from the government.\n\n     The court imposed a 121-month sentence, stating that it had\n\n“taken into consideration all of the elements in the presentence\n\nreport[,] including the nature of the offense and all [of] the\n\ntestimony that the court received . . . in the course of trial.”\n\nDefense counsel objected, asking the court to reconsider in light\n\nof the court’s reliance on trial testimony.    The court explained:\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f     I said in the nature of the offense and my recollection\n     of the testimony at trial. You are talking about 8ths\n     and quarters, that was for a long time that cocaine was\n     being supplied. So the amount of 3.5 from the evidence\n     that I recall, is more than, I would say more than\n     generous.\n\nDefense counsel responded:\n\n     But the question is as it pertains to him. I was not\n     privy to that information and I don’t think it is fair\n     that I am standing here requesting . . . the . . . lower\n     end of the guideline [range] and then not have that\n     information to be able to refute that. I am sure there\n     were other suppliers in the indictment.\n\nThe court declined to reconsider:\n\n     Counsel, the sentence at the lower or upper end of the\n     guideline   range  is   discretionary.     Taking   into\n     consideration the presentence report, the position of\n     this defendant within the organizational chart which you\n     knew, you had, [and] all [of] the evidence that I have\n     before me. I am exercising my discretion and sentencing\n     [Rivera-Rodríguez] to the upper end.\n\n     Defense counsel expressed her concern that the court was not\n\ntaking into consideration Rivera-Rodríguez’s employment history or\n\nstatus as a first-time offender.     The court noted, however, that\n\n“one of the main purposes of sentencing considerations now under\n\nthis Congress, under these sentencing guidelines[,] is deterrence\n\nand punishment,” and explained that the court had considered the\n\nfactors cited by defense counsel “by not doing [its] own sentencing\n\nguideline calculation and imposing a much higher guideline [sic]\n\nbased on the evidence that [it had].”\n\n                               II.\n\n     Rivera-Rodríguez assigns three errors on appeal.     First, he\n\n\n                               -7-\n\fcontends that the district court erred by failing to give him\n\nnotice that the court intended to rely on testimony from his co-\n\ndefendants’ trial in deciding where to sentence him within the\n\nguideline   range.    Second,    Rivera-Rodríguez   argues   that   the\n\ngovernment breached its plea agreement with him by urging the court\n\nto impose a higher sentence than that which the government agreed\n\nto recommend, and by arguing that he was responsible for a quantity\n\nof cocaine greater than the amount stipulated.      Finally, Rivera-\n\nRodríguez claims that the court erred by imposing a two-level\n\nincrease for his role in the offense pursuant to U.S.S.G. §\n\n3B1.1(c), and asks that his case be remanded to the district court\n\nfor resentencing under United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220\n\n(2005).   We will address each argument in turn.\n\n                            A.    Notice\n\n     In arriving at an appropriate sentence, a district court\n\nenjoys “broad discretion in the information it may receive and\n\nconsider regarding [a] defendant and his conduct.”     United States\n\nv. Curran, 926 F.2d 59, 61 (1st Cir. 1991) (citations omitted); see\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3661 (“No limitation shall be placed on the information\n\nconcerning the background, character, and conduct of a person\n\nconvicted of an offense which a court of the United States may\n\nreceive and consider for the purpose of imposing an appropriate\n\nsentence.”).   In exercising this discretion, the district court is\n\nfree to consider information from a trial proceeding at which the\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fdefendant was not present.          See United States v. Rios, 893 F.2d\n\n479, 481 (2d Cir. 1990) (citing United States v. Romano, 825 F.2d\n\n725, 728 (2d Cir. 1987)); see also United States v. Blackwell, 49\n\nF.3d 1232, 1236 (7th Cir. 1995) (collecting cases).                  It is well\n\nestablished, however, “that a convicted defendant has the right to\n\nbe sentenced on the basis of accurate and reliable information, and\n\nthat implicit in this right is the opportunity to rebut the\n\ngovernment’s   evidence     and    the   information    in    the    presentence\n\nreport.”    Blackwell, 49 F.3d at 1235 (citation omitted).                   The\n\nSupreme Court has explained that Fed. R. Crim. P. 32, which\n\naddresses sentencing and judgment, “contemplates full adversary\n\ntesting of the issues relevant to a [g]uidelines sentence and\n\nmandates that the parties be given ‘an opportunity to comment upon\n\nthe probation officer’s determination and on other matters relating\n\nto the appropriate sentence.’” Burns v. United States, 501 U.S.\n\n129, 135 (1991) (quoting Fed. R. Crim. P. 32).\n\n      In United States v. Berzon, 941 F.2d 8 (1st Cir. 1991), we\n\nemphasized “that a defendant must be provided with a meaningful\n\nopportunity to comment on the factual information on which his or\n\nher sentence is based.”      Id. at 10.      At issue was defendant Robert\n\nBerzon’s   claim   that    the    district   court    had    based   its   upward\n\nadjustment of his base offense level on testimony from a co-\n\ndefendant’s sentencing hearing that neither Berzon nor his attorney\n\nhad   attended.      The    testimony       offered   new     and    substantial\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\finformation about Berzon’s role in the offense as a leader or\n\norganizer under U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(c).            Berzon contended, however,\n\nthat he had no knowledge of the damaging testimony at the time of\n\nhis own sentencing.        In finding that a defendant must be provided\n\nwith notice before such information is considered, we concluded\n\nthat “a defendant may not be placed in a position where, because of\n\nhis ignorance of the information being used against him, he is\n\neffectively denied an opportunity to comment on or otherwise\n\nchallenge material information considered by the district court.”\n\nId. at 21; see Burns, 501 U.S. at 136 (“‘Th[e] right to be heard\n\nhas little reality or worth unless one is informed’ that a decision\n\nis contemplated.”) (quoting Mullane v. Cent. Hanover Bank & Trust\n\nCo., 339 U.S. 306, 314 (1950)).\n\n       Because it was unclear from the record, however, whether the\n\ndistrict court had considered the undisclosed information, we\n\nremanded the case to the original sentencing judge with directions\n\nthat   he   indicate   whether     he   had   materially   relied     on   this\n\ninformation in sentencing Berzon.           Berzon, 941 F.2d at 10.    If the\n\nsentencing judge answered affirmatively, we ordered that Berzon’s\n\nsentence be vacated, and Berzon be resentenced by a different\n\ndistrict judge.     Id.\n\n       On appeal, Rivera-Rodríguez relies heavily on this court’s\n\ndecision in Berzon, arguing that Berzon requires us to vacate his\n\nsentence    and   remand    for   resentencing.      According   to   Rivera-\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fRodríguez, the district court erred when it failed to notify him\n\nthat it would rely on testimony from his co-defendants’ trial in\n\ndeciding where to sentence him within the guideline range.        He\n\nclaims that he had no knowledge of the prior trial testimony and\n\nargues that he was blind-sided by the contention that he was a\n\nsignificant supplier of drugs to the conspiracy.      As a result,\n\nRivera-Rodríguez argues that he was denied the opportunity to\n\nchallenge and rebut the court’s reliance on such information in\n\nviolation of Fed. R. Crim. P. 32 and his right to due process under\n\nthe Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United\n\nStates Constitution.3\n\n     Rivera-Rodríguez’s reliance on Berzon, however, is misplaced.\n\nOne of our concerns in Berzon was that the undisclosed testimony at\n\nissue contained new and significant information about Berzon’s role\n\nin the offense - information that was nowhere in the record and\n\nwhich Berzon had no opportunity to challenge.   Id. at 17.   The same\n\ncan not be said here.   At the sentencing hearing on November 7,\n\n2003, defense counsel argued that her client was a “peripheral\n\nsupplier,” who had only supplied “8ths and 4ths” of a kilogram of\n\ncocaine.   The court, however, was not persuaded.    In imposing a\n\nsentence of 121 months, the sentencing judge made a general, and\n\n\n\n     3\n       Although Rivera-Rodríguez relies, in part, on the due\nprocess clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, we note that the\nFourteenth Amendment applies only to the states.   Bolling v.\nSharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 498-99 (1954).\n\n                               -11-\n\fsomewhat vague, reference to “all [of] the testimony that the court\n\nreceived . . . in the course of trial.”       When defense counsel\n\nobjected to this remark, the court clarified:\n\n     I said in the nature of the offense and my recollection\n     of the testimony at trial. You are talking about 8ths\n     and quarters, that was for a long time that cocaine was\n     being supplied. So the amount of 3.5 from the evidence\n     that I recall, is more than, I would say more than\n     generous.\n\nBased on this exchange, it is clear that the district court\n\nmentioned the testimony it had heard at trial to emphasize that the\n\ncourt was familiar with both the length of time the conspiracy had\n\noperated and the quantity of drugs that had been involved.      By\n\ndoing so, the sentencing judge was responding to defense counsel’s\n\nargument that her client was a “peripheral supplier,” who had\n\nsupplied only small amounts of cocaine.\n\n     This information was hardly new to Rivera-Rodríguez and his\n\ncounsel.   See id. (requiring notice when a court expects to\n\nconsider “new information” from a separate proceeding). The length\n\nof the conspiracy and quantity of drugs involved were set forth in\n\nthe indictment, plea agreement, and PSR.   The PSR noted that under\n\nthe terms of the plea agreement, Rivera-Rodríguez had “pled guilty\n\nin exchange for the stipulation of a lesser drug amount.”   Indeed,\n\nthis information was at the heart of the government’s argument that\n\nRivera-Rodríguez was a “significant” supplier of cocaine.   At his\n\ndetention hearing, three days after Rivera-Rodríguez was arrested,\n\nthe government was asked about the quantity of drugs Rivera-\n\n                               -12-\n\fRodríguez had supplied at any given time. The government responded\n\nthat:\n\n     [Rivera-Rodríguez] has been involved since approximately\n     1992 or 1993 and . . . he has supplied kilogram\n     quantities, perhaps not one kilo each time there’s a drug\n     transaction, perhaps half a kilo quantities, perhaps\n     quarter of a kilo or eighth of a kilo quantities. But\n     we’re not talking grams here.     We’re talking kilo or\n     portion of kilo quantities of both cocaine and heroin.\n\nNotably, this is the same type of information that the court would\n\nlater rely on at Rivera-Rodríguez’s sentencing.               Any factual\n\ninformation from the trial to which the court may have been\n\nreferring, therefore, was neither new nor absent from the record.\n\n     Furthermore, we are not persuaded by Rivera-Rodríguez’s claim\n\nthat he did not have a meaningful opportunity to respond to such\n\ninformation. Although Rivera-Rodríguez contends that he was blind-\n\nsided by the assertion that he was a “significant” supplier, the\n\ngovernment consistently maintained, throughout the proceedings\n\nbelow,   that    Rivera-Rodríguez    was   a   “main   supplier     to   the\n\norganization.” At the bail review hearing on January 29, 2003, the\n\ngovernment   referred   to   Rivera-Rodríguez    as    a   “major   cocaine\n\nsupplier.”      In fact, even as early as the detention hearing on\n\nOctober 11, 2002, the government had described his role as a\n\nsupplier to the organization as “significant.”\n\n     At the sentencing hearing, defense counsel anticipated this\n\nargument from the government, stating that she was “sure the\n\ngovernment [was] going to get up and say [her client] was one of\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\fthe main suppliers.”    In an attempt to counter this claim, defense\n\ncounsel argued that her client was only a “peripheral supplier,”\n\nminimizing    the   quantity   of   drugs   that   Rivera-Rodríguez   had\n\nsupplied.    Thus, Rivera-Rodríguez clearly was on notice that this\n\ninformation was at issue during his sentencing, and he was given an\n\nopportunity to rebut it.\n\n     Moreover, there is no indication from the record that the\n\nsentencing judge materially relied on any undisclosed testimony in\n\ndeciding where to sentence Rivera-Rodríguez within the guideline\n\nrange.   Id. at 10.    In imposing a sentence at the high-end of the\n\nguideline range, the district court stated that it had “taken into\n\nconsideration all of the elements in the presentence report[,]\n\nincluding the nature of the offense and all [of] the testimony that\n\nthe court received . . . in the course of trial.”          After defense\n\ncounsel challenged the court’s reliance on the trial testimony, the\n\ncourt corrected her:\n\n     Counsel, the sentence at the lower or upper end of the\n     guideline   range  is   discretionary.     Taking   into\n     consideration the presentence report, the position of\n     this defendant within the organizational chart which you\n     knew, you had, [and] all [of] the evidence that I have\n     before me. I am exercising my discretion and sentencing\n     [Rivera-Rodríguez] to the upper end.\n\nDespite Rivera-Rodríguez’s arguments to the contrary, it is clear\n\nfrom these comments that the district court did not materially rely\n\non any specific testimony from the trial.          Instead, as discussed\n\nabove, the court made a general reference to the trial for the\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\flimited purpose of highlighting the length of the conspiracy and\n\nthe amount of drugs involved. See United States v. Fuentes-Moreno,\n\n895 F.2d 24, 26 (1st Cir. 1990) (finding no error in district\n\ncourt’s “general reference” to the trial of Fuentes-Moreno’s co-\n\ndefendants in imposing sentence).      Although the court mentioned\n\ntrial testimony in deciding where to sentence Rivera-Rodríguez\n\nwithin the guideline range, the sentencing judge relied on record\n\nevidence, i.e., evidence that Rivera-Rodríguez was well aware of\n\nand had an opportunity to challenge and rebut at his sentencing.\n\nAccordingly, under these circumstances, we find no error.\n\n                        B.   Plea Agreement\n\n     Rivera-Rodríguez also argues that the government breached the\n\nplea agreement between the parties by urging the district court to\n\nimpose a higher sentence than that which the government agreed to\n\nrecommend, and by arguing that he was responsible for a quantity of\n\ncocaine greater than the amount stipulated.   Specifically, Rivera-\n\nRodríguez claims that the government breached the plea agreement by\n\nasking the court to find a base offense level of 38, as opposed to\n\nthe level 30 contemplated by the agreement, and by stating that\n\n“[t]here were quantities [of cocaine] frankly beyond the amount\n\nstipulated [to] in the plea agreement . . . .”   Again, however, we\n\ndisagree.\n\n     The plea agreement between the parties stipulated that Rivera-\n\nRodríguez would be held responsible for 3.5 to 5 kilograms of\n\n\n                                -15-\n\fcocaine, yielding a base offense level of 30 under U.S.S.G. §\n\n2D1.1(c)(5).     The parties assumed that Rivera-Rodríguez would be\n\nfound   to   have   a   Criminal   History   Category   of   I,   making   the\n\napplicable guideline range 97 to 121 months.            Although the plea\n\nagreement warned Rivera-Rodríguez that his sentence was “within the\n\nsound discretion of the sentencing judge,” the agreement provided\n\nthat the government would recommend 121 months of imprisonment,\n\nwhile Rivera-Rodríguez would request 97 months.\n\n     Following defense counsel’s argument for the low-end of the\n\nguideline range at the sentencing hearing, the government “ask[ed]\n\nthe court to impose the higher end of the sentencing guidelines,\n\nthat being 121 months . . . .”         In support of this request, the\n\ngovernment referred to the two-month trial of Rivera-Rodríguez’s\n\nco-defendants, and stated that:\n\n     all [of] the evidence that the government has and\n     presented at trial indicates that were this defendant to\n     go to trial, the government would be seeking a [base\n     offense] level [of] 38 to start with. In this case we\n     are seeking a much lower amount.\n\n          There were quantities frankly beyond the amount\n     stipulated in the plea agreement and I submit that the\n     government is bound by the plea agreement to recommend a\n     maximum of 121 months . . . . I would ask the court to\n     impose the sentence that the government now recommends.\n     (emphasis supplied).\n\n     Ordinarily, whether the government has breached its plea\n\nagreement with a defendant is a question of law and our review is\n\nplenary.     See United States v. Doe, 233 F.3d 642, 643-44 (1st Cir.\n\n2000) (citing United States v. Clark, 55 F.3d 9, 11 (1st Cir.\n\n                                     -16-\n\f1995)); United States v. Canada, 960 F.2d 263, 269 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\nWhere as here, however, the “defendant has knowledge of conduct\n\nostensibly amounting to a breach of a plea agreement, yet does not\n\nbring that breach to the attention of the sentencing court, we\n\nreview only for plain error.”             United States v. Saxena, 229 F.3d 1,\n\n5 (1st Cir. 2000).       Thus, we consider whether: (1) there was error,\n\n(2)    it   was    plain,      (3)   the    error    affected     the    defendant’s\n\nsubstantial rights, and (4) the error adversely impacted the\n\nfairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\n\nUnited States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732 (1993); Saxena, 229 F.3d\n\nat 5.\n\n       “[W]hen a plea rests in any significant degree on a promise or\n\nagreement of the prosecutor, so that it can be said to be part of\n\nthe inducement or consideration, such promise must be fulfilled.”\n\nSantobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 262 (1971); see United States\n\nv. Riggs, 287 F.3d 221, 224 (1st Cir. 2002); Saxena, 229 F.3d at 5-\n\n6.    Because defendants must ultimately waive fundamental rights as\n\na result of entering into any plea agreement, “we hold prosecutors\n\nengaging in plea bargaining to ‘the most meticulous standards of\n\nboth promise and performance.’” Riggs, 287 F.3d at 224 (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Velez Carrero, 77 F.3d 11, 11 (1st Cir. 1996)).\n\nThis    requirement          prohibits,     therefore,     “not    only        explicit\n\nrepudiation       of   the    government’s        assurances,   but     must    in   the\n\ninterests of fairness be read to forbid end-runs around them.”\n\n\n                                           -17-\n\fUnited States v. Voccola, 600 F.Supp. 1534, 1537 (D.R.I. 1985),\n\nquoted in United States v. Frazier, 340 F.3d 5, 10 (1st Cir. 2003);\n\nSaxena, 229 F.3d at 6; Canada, 960 F.2d at 269.\n\n     The plea agreement expressly provided that the government\n\nwould recommend a sentence at the high-end of the guideline range.\n\nThis is exactly what it did.              The government asked the court to\n\nimpose a sentence of 121 months, not once, but twice during the\n\ncourse of its argument.        Cf. Canada, 960 F.2d at 268 (finding that\n\nalthough “the Assistant United States Attorney informed the court\n\nof the plea agreement and noted the existence therein of the\n\ngovernment’s promise to recommend only 36 months of incarceration,\n\nshe never herself affirmatively recommended a 36 month sentence”)\n\n(emphasis supplied).     Indeed, the government indicated that it was\n\n“bound by the plea agreement to recommend a maximum of 121 months.”\n\nThus, the government did not technically violate the terms of the\n\nplea agreement.      See Frazier, 340 F.3d at 12.\n\n     The   government,       however,      “cannot      rely    on   mere    technical\n\ncompliance,    and   adherence       to    the    terms    of   a    plea    agreement\n\n‘requires more than lip service on a prosecutor’s part.’” Id.\n\n(quoting   Saxena,     229    F.3d    at    6).         Although     the    government\n\nrecommended a sentence of 121 months, it also informed the court\n\nthat if the government had been forced to go to trial it would have\n\nsought a base offense level of 38.                      Moreover, as noted, the\n\ngovernment    stated   that    “[t]here          were   quantities     [of    cocaine]\n\n\n                                          -18-\n\ffrankly beyond the amount stipulated [to] in the plea agreement.”\n\nRivera-Rodríguez, therefore, argues that the government violated\n\nthe spirit, if not the letter, of the plea agreement.\n\n      Although the government’s conduct here is somewhat troubling,\n\nwe do not believe that these statements rise to the level of plain\n\nerror.     Despite the government’s statement that it would seek a\n\nbase offense level of 38 if it were forced to go to trial, the\n\ngovernment reiterated that under the circumstances, it was “seeking\n\na much lower amount.”        Furthermore, having explicitly stated that\n\nit was recommending a sentence at the high-end of the guideline\n\nrange, the government was free to offer reasons in support of that\n\nrecommendation.        See United States v. Queensborough, 227 F.3d 149,\n\n157 (3rd Cir. 2000).         Thus, the government argued that Rivera-\n\nRodríguez was a significant supplier of cocaine, and that “[t]here\n\nwere quantities frankly beyond the amount stipulated [to] in the\n\nplea agreement.”        It offered these reasons in response to defense\n\ncounsel’s argument that her client was a peripheral supplier, and\n\nin support of the government’s request for a sentence at the high-\n\nend   of    the     guideline    range.     Accordingly,    under   these\n\ncircumstances, we can not say that the government’s conduct at\n\nRivera-Rodríguez’s sentencing rises to the level of plain error.\n\n                  C.   Role Enhancement and Booker Remand\n\n      Finally, Rivera-Rodríguez argues that the district court erred\n\nby imposing a two-level increase for his role in the offense\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\fpursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(c).           Although he concedes that he\n\nstipulated to his role in the offense as an “organizer, leader,\n\nmanager, or supervisor,” Rivera-Rodríguez contends that there was\n\ninsufficient evidence in the record to support the sentencing\n\njudge’s    determination   that    the     enhancement     was    warranted.4\n\nAdditionally, Rivera-Rodríguez asks that his case be remanded to\n\nthe district court for resentencing under United States v. Booker,\n\n543 U.S. 220 (2005), on the ground that there is a reasonable\n\nprobability of a lower sentence under an advisory guidelines\n\nsystem.    These arguments may be quickly dispatched.\n\n     1.    Role Enhancement\n\n     At the bail review hearing on January 29, 2003, the government\n\nindicated that Rivera-Rodríguez was “involved in the upper echelons\n\nof   the   [drug-trafficking]     organization,”     and    had     delegated\n\nauthority to others to make transactions on his behalf.                   The\n\ngovernment    also   introduced   an      organizational    chart    of   the\n\nconspiracy and asserted that Rivera-Rodríguez had acted as the\n\n“right hand” of the leader of the organization.            According to the\n\n\n     4\n        Rivera-Rodríguez also argues that the court erred by\nimposing a two-level increase in his base offense level under\nU.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(c), without proof beyond a reasonable doubt, in\nviolation of Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296 (2004).      This\nargument, however, is clearly baseless.     See United States v.\nAntonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 75 (1st Cir. 2005) (“The error is not\nthat a judge (by a preponderance of the evidence) determined facts\nunder the Guidelines which increased a sentence beyond that\nauthorized by the jury verdict or an admission by the defendant;\nthe error is only that the judge did so in a mandatory Guidelines\nsystem.”).\n\n                                   -20-\n\fplea agreement, therefore, Rivera-Rodríguez received a two-level\n\nincrease in his base offense level for his role in the offense as\n\nan “organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor” pursuant to U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 3B1.1(c). At the sentencing hearing, the district court accepted\n\nthis    stipulation     and   applied     the    enhancement      without   making\n\nspecific findings to support its conclusion.                 Rivera-Rodríguez did\n\nnot object.     On appeal, Rivera-Rodríguez now argues that there was\n\nno factual basis for his enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(c).\n\n       Where a defendant fails to object in the district court to a\n\nsentencing enhancement, we review that enhancement only for plain\n\nerror.     See United States v. Torres-Velazquez, 480 F.3d 100, 103\n\n(1st Cir. 2007).        Ordinarily, defendants should be held to the\n\nterms of a plea agreement that they knowingly and voluntarily\n\naccept.    United States v. Teeter, 257 F.3d 14, 28 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\nA   plea   agreement    is    akin   to   a     contract,     “binding   upon   the\n\nprosecution and the defense alike.”              Id. (citing United States v.\n\nOrtiz-Santiago, 211 F.3d 146, 151 (1st Cir. 2000).                 Thus, although\n\nstipulations are normally not binding on a district court, should\n\nthe    court   decide   to    accept    and     act   upon    a   stipulation   for\n\nsentencing purposes, the parties will usually be firmly bound. Id.\n\nat 28. We have acknowledged that:\n\n       [t]his general rule will apply when, for example, a\n       defendant stipulates to a matter of fact or to the\n       applicability of a sentencing guideline (the legal\n       meaning of which is pellucid) to the unique facts of her\n       case. After all, the defendant knows what she has done,\n       and has little cause for complaint if the district court\n\n                                       -21-\n\f       takes her at her word.\n\nId.    “To hold anything else would be to reduce stipulations to mere\n\ninconsequential gestures.” United States v. Sandles, 80 F.3d 1145,\n\n1148 (7th Cir. 1996).       Moreover, even if Rivera-Rodríguez were not\n\nbound by his stipulation, we note that the record clearly supports\n\nthe district court’s determination.            See United States v. García-\n\nMorales, 382 F.3d 12, 20 (1st Cir. 2004); United States v. Medina,\n\n167 F.3d 77, 80 (1st Cir. 1999).              Accordingly, the court’s two-\n\nlevel enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(c) was not in error.\n\n       2.   Booker Remand\n\n       Finally, Rivera-Rodríguez contends that his case should be\n\nremanded to the district court for resentencing under Booker, on\n\nthe ground that there is a reasonable probability of a lower\n\nsentence under an advisory guidelines system.                   Rivera-Rodríguez\n\nconcedes, however, that he did not preserve his claim under Booker;\n\nwe therefore review only for plain error.              See United States v.\n\nAntonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 75 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n       In   support   of    his   claim,      Rivera-Rodríguez     makes   three\n\narguments.       First, he argues that the district court should not\n\nhave    relied   solely    on   the   guideline    goals   of    deterrence   and\n\npunishment, when under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), a number of other\n\nfactors must now be considered in setting the appropriate sentence.\n\nSecond, he asserts that the sentencing judge would not have relied\n\non testimony from the trial of Rivera-Rodríguez’s co-defendants if\n\n\n                                       -22-\n\fhe had known that his sentencing findings had to be supported by\n\nproof beyond a reasonable doubt.           Third, Rivera-Rodríguez argues\n\nthat, under an advisory guidelines system, the district court is\n\nnow free to consider personal characteristics and other mitigating\n\nfactors that militate toward a more lenient sentence.\n\n      Rivera-Rodríguez,     however,     “has   not    shown    a   reasonable\n\nprobability - not even a possibility - that the district court\n\nwould have imposed a different (more lenient) sentence had it\n\nunderstood that the sentencing guidelines were advisory rather than\n\nmandatory.”      United States v. González-Mercado, 402 F.3d 294, 303\n\n(1st Cir. 2005). Pre-Booker, a district court was free to consider\n\nall   of   the   factors   listed   in   §   3553(a)    in     determining   an\n\nappropriate sentence within the applicable guideline range.                  The\n\ndistrict court, here, noted that two of those factors, deterrence\n\nand punishment, were significant factors to be considered.                   The\n\ncourt’s emphasis on deterrence and punishment, however, does not\n\nmean that it did not consider the other enumerated factors in\n\narriving at the appropriate sentence.           In this instance, it only\n\nmeans that the court believed that deterrence and punishment were\n\nparticularly relevant in Rivera-Rodríguez’s circumstances.\n\n      Rivera-Rodríguez’s second argument, that the district court\n\nwould not have relied on testimony from the trial of Rivera-\n\nRodríguez’s co-defendants had it known that its sentencing findings\n\nhad to be supported by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, is based on\n\n\n                                    -23-\n\fa false assumption: post-Booker, a district court’s sentencing\n\nfindings need not be supported by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nSee Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 75 (“The error is not that a judge\n\n(by a preponderance of the evidence) determined facts under the\n\nGuidelines which increased a sentence beyond that authorized by the\n\njury verdict or an admission by the defendant; the error is only\n\nthat the judge did so in a mandatory Guidelines system.”).\n\n      Rivera-Rodríguez’s third argument fails as well.          Pre-Booker,\n\na district court had discretion to consider a defendant’s personal\n\ncharacteristics in deciding where to sentence the defendant within\n\nthe guideline range.        See, e.g., U.S.S.G. § 5H1.1-12.           Indeed,\n\ndefense counsel argued at the sentencing hearing that Rivera-\n\nRodríguez was a first time offender, had a stable marriage and a\n\nsubstantial job history, voluntarily abandoned the conspiracy well\n\nbefore his arrest, and had undertaken rehabilitation efforts in\n\nprison.   The district court, however, was not persuaded.              Given\n\nthat the court sentenced Rivera-Rodríguez to the high-end of the\n\nguideline range, it is likely that the court would impose the same\n\nsentence under an advisory system.           See González-Mercado, 402 F.3d\n\nat 304 (“When, under a mandatory guidelines regime, a sentencing\n\ncourt has elected to sentence the defendant substantially above the\n\nbottom of the range, that is a telling indication that the court,\n\nif   acting   under   an   advisory   guidelines    regime,   would   in   all\n\nlikelihood have imposed the same sentence.”). Accordingly, we find\n\n\n                                      -24-\n\fthat Rivera-Rodríguez has failed to show a reasonable probability\n\nof a more lenient sentence on remand.5\n\n                              III.\n\n     For the reasons set forth above, we affirm Rivera-Rodríguez’s\n\nsentence.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n       Rivera-Rodríguez also argues that his deteriorating mental\nhealth condition post-sentencing supports a reasonable probability\nof a lower sentence on remand. Appellate counsel raised this issue\nfor the first time in her reply brief, but offered no specific\ninformation about Rivera-Rodríguez’s condition. Where an issue is\nraised only in a cursory manner, it is waived. See, e.g., United\nStates v.

Finding his assignments of error to be without merit, we affirm Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez's sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez was a member of a drug-trafficking organization that sold cocaine, crack cocaine, heroin, and marijuana at \"drug points\" in and around Guayama, Puerto Rico. On September 26, 2002, following a two-year investigation by federal and local law enforcement agencies, a federal grand jury returned a two-count indictment against Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez and forty-two co-defendants. Count One of the indictment alleged that from approximately April 28, 1993, to September 26, 2002, the defendants conspired to possess with intent to distribute controlled substances in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(A).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the indictment, Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez supplied heroin and cocaine to the drug-trafficking organization. He is one of only two suppliers identified in the indictment. At a detention hearing on October 11, 2002, the government described Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez's role in the conspiracy as \"significant.\" When asked about the quantity of drugs he had supplied to the organization at any given time, the government responded that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez] has been involved since approximately 1992 or 1993 and . . . he has supplied kilogram quantities, perhaps not one kilo each time there's a drug transaction, perhaps half a kilo quantities, perhaps quarter of a kilo or eighth of a kilo quantities. But we're not talking grams here. We're talking kilo or portion of kilo quantities of both cocaine and heroin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a bail review hearing on January 29, 2003, the government again characterized Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez's role in the conspiracy as \"substantial\" and \"significant.\" The government described Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez as a \"major cocaine supplier\" and informed the magistrate judge that it had three or four witnesses who had provided information that Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez was a \"main supplier to the organization.\" The government indicated that Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez was \"involved in the upper echelons of the organization,\" and that he had delegated authority to others to make transactions on his behalf. The government also introduced an organizational chart and asserted that Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez acted as the \"right hand\" of the leader of the organization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 15, 2003, Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez pleaded guilty pursuant to a plea agreement with the government. The parties agreed that Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez would be held responsible for 3.5 to 5 kilograms of cocaine, which yielded a base offense level of 30 under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(c)(5). The parties also stipulated that Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez would receive a two-level increase for his role in the offense as \"an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor\" pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(c), and a two-level decrease for his acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties anticipated a Criminal History Category of I, making the applicable sentencing range 97 to 121 months. Although the plea agreement warned Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez that his sentence was \"within the sound discretion of the sentencing judge,\" the parties agreed that the government would recommend 121 months of incarceration, while Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez would request 97 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The presentence report (\"PSR\") adopted the guideline calculations agreed to by the parties in the plea agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The PSR described Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez as \"the cocaine and marihuana supplier to the organization.\" Notably, the PSR stated that, as one of the suppliers to the drug-trafficking organization, Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez was \"more culpable\" than those members of the conspiracy who sold the narcotics. The PSR also noted that under the terms of the plea agreement, Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez had \"pled guilty in exchange for the stipulation of a lesser drug amount.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing on November 7, 2003, the court accepted the guideline calculations agreed to by the parties and adopted by the PSR. Defense counsel asked the court to sentence Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez to the low-end of the guideline range, or 97 months. In support of this request for a sentence at the low-end of the guideline range, defense counsel noted that Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez had a long-term, stable marriage and a six-year-old daughter. Counsel also argued that, despite having only a ninth grade education, Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez had worked as a land surveyor, and had owned and operated a small grocery store since 2000. Defense counsel informed the court that she had information that a witness at the trial of several of Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez's co-defendants had \"testified to the fact that after [Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez] engaged in his [grocery] business, he withdrew from the conspiracy.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In arguing for the low-end of the guideline range, defense counsel also asserted that the pre-trial discovery provided by the government showed that Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez was only a \"peripheral supplier.\" Defense counsel stated that \"the evidence against [Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez] consisted of two or three witnesses saying that he had supplied 8ths and 4ths [of a kilogram], and that is the reason why the quantity of 3.5 to 5 kilograms of cocaine was stipulated [to] in the plea agreement.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In closing, defense counsel observed that Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez was a first-time offender and had shown a willingness to rehabilitate. She also noted that he \"was one of the first defendants to come forward and accept his responsibility.\" Accordingly, defense counsel asked the court to consider a sentence at the low-end of the guideline range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government, on the other hand, asked the court to sentence Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez to the high-end of the guideline range. The government stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As [y]our Honor knows well, having presided over the [two] month trial [of several co-defendants], there were numerous drug points, between Guayama and Salinas, at least ten. The drugs had to come from somewhere, [y]our Honor, I believe the court heard testimony that there were numerous sources, one being one of the defendants that stood trial and one being the man that stands here before you. . . . I submit that the testimony, [pre-trial discovery], and all [of] the evidence that the government has and presented at trial indicates that were this defendant to go to trial, the government would be seeking a [base offense] level [of] 38 to start with. In this case we are seeking a much lower amount.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There were quantities frankly beyond the amount stipulated in the plea agreement and I submit that the government is bound by the plea agreement to recommend a maximum of 121 months . . . I would ask the court to impose the sentence that the government now recommends.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defense counsel countered that the quantity of drugs that had been stipulated to in the plea agreement was based on the pre-trial discovery she had received from the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court imposed a 121-month sentence, stating that it had \"taken into consideration all of the elements in the presentence report[,] including the nature of the offense and all [of] the testimony that the court received . . . in the course of trial.\" Defense counsel objected, asking the court to reconsider in light of the court's reliance on trial testimony. The court explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I said in the nature of the offense and my recollection of the testimony at trial. You are talking about 8ths and quarters, that was for a long time that cocaine was being supplied. So the amount of 3.5 from the evidence that I recall, is more than, I would say more than generous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Defense counsel responded:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the question is as it pertains to him. I was not privy to that information and I don't think it is fair that I am standing here requesting . . . the . . . lower end of the guideline [range] and then not have that information to be able to refute that. I am sure there were other suppliers in the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The court declined to reconsider:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counsel, the sentence at the lower or upper end of the guideline range is discretionary. Taking into consideration the presentence report, the position of this defendant within the organizational chart which you knew, you had, [and] all [of] the evidence that I have before me. I am exercising my discretion and sentencing [Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez] to the upper end.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defense counsel expressed her concern that the court was not taking into consideration Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez's employment history or status as a first-time offender. The court noted, however, that \"one of the main purposes of sentencing considerations now under this Congress, under these sentencing guidelines[,] is deterrence and punishment,\" and explained that the court had considered the factors cited by defense counsel \"by not doing [its] own sentencing guideline calculation and imposing a much higher guideline [sic] based on the evidence that [it had].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez assigns three errors on appeal. First, he contends that the district court erred by failing to give him notice that the court intended to rely on testimony from his co-defendants' trial in deciding where to sentence him within the guideline range. Second, Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez argues that the government breached its plea agreement with him by urging the court to impose a higher sentence than that which the government agreed to recommend, and by arguing that he was responsible for a quantity of cocaine greater than the amount stipulated. Finally, Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez claims that the court erred by imposing a two-level increase for his role in the offense pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(c), and asks that his case be remanded to the district court for resentencing under <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We will address each argument in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Notice</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In arriving at an appropriate sentence, a district court enjoys \"broad discretion in the information it may receive and consider regarding [a] defendant and his conduct.\" <i>United States v. Curran,</i> 926 F.2d 59, 61 (1st Cir.1991) (citations omitted); <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3661 (\"No limitation shall be placed on the information concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person convicted of an offense which a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence.\"). In exercising this discretion, the district court is free to consider information from a trial proceeding at which the defendant was not present. <i>See United States v. Rios,</i> 893 F.2d 479, 481 (2d Cir.1990) (citing <i>United States v. Romano,</i> 825 F.2d 725, 728 (2d Cir.1987)); <i>see also United States v. Blackwell,</i> 49 F.3d 1232, 1236 (7th Cir. 1995) (collecting cases). It is well established, however, \"that a convicted defendant has the right to be sentenced on the basis of accurate and reliable information, and that implicit in this right is the opportunity to rebut the government's evidence and the information in the presentence report.\" <i>Blackwell,</i> 49 F.3d at 1235 (citation omitted). The Supreme Court has explained that Fed.R.Crim.P. 32, which addresses sentencing and judgment, \"contemplates full adversary testing of the issues relevant to a[g]uidelines sentence and mandates that the parties be given `an opportunity to comment upon the probation officer's determination and on other matters relating to the appropriate sentence.'\" <i>Burns v. United States,</i> 501 U.S. 129, 135, 111 S.Ct. 2182, 115 L.Ed.2d 123 (1991) (quoting Fed.R.Crim.P. 32).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>United States v. Berzon,</i> 941 F.2d 8 (1st Cir.1991), we emphasized \"that a defendant must be provided with a meaningful opportunity to comment on the factual information on which his or her sentence is based.\" <i>Id.</i> at 10. At issue was defendant Robert Berzon's claim that the district court had based its upward adjustment of his base offense level on testimony from a co-defendant's sentencing hearing that neither Berzon nor his attorney had attended. The testimony offered new and substantial information about Berzon's role in the offense as a leader or organizer under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(c). Berzon contended, however, that he had no knowledge of the damaging testimony at the time of his own sentencing. In finding that a defendant must be provided with notice before such information is considered, we concluded that \"a defendant may not be placed in a position where, because of his ignorance of the information being used against him, he is effectively denied an opportunity to comment on or otherwise challenge material information considered by the district court.\" <i>Id.</i> at 21; <i>see Burns,</i> 501 U.S. at 136, 111 S.Ct. 2182 (\"`Th[e] right to be heard has little reality or worth unless one is informed' that a decision is contemplated.\") (quoting <i>Mullane v. Cent. Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co.,</i> 339 U.S. 306, 314, 70 S.Ct. 652, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because it was unclear from the record, however, whether the district court had considered the undisclosed information, we remanded the case to the original sentencing judge with directions that he indicate whether he had materially relied on this information in sentencing Berzon. <i>Berzon,</i> 941 F.2d at 10. If the sentencing judge answered affirmatively, we ordered that Berzon's sentence be vacated, and Berzon be resentenced by a different district judge. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez relies heavily on this court's decision in <i>Berzon,</i> arguing that <i>Berzon</i> requires us to vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing. According to Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez, the district court erred when it failed to notify him that it would rely on testimony from his co-defendants' trial in deciding where to sentence him within the guideline range. He claims that he had no knowledge of the prior trial testimony and argues that he was blind-sided by the contention that he was a significant supplier of drugs to the conspiracy. As a result, Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez argues that he was denied the opportunity to challenge and rebut the court's reliance on such information in violation of Fed. R.Crim.P. 32 and his right to due process under the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez's reliance on <i>Berzon,</i> however, is misplaced. One of our concerns in <i>Berzon</i> was that the undisclosed testimony at issue contained <i>new</i> and <i>significant</i> information about Berzon's role in the offense &#8212; information that was nowhere in the record and which Berzon had no opportunity to challenge. <i>Id.</i> at 17. The same can not be said here. At the sentencing hearing on November 7, 2003, defense counsel argued that her client was a \"peripheral supplier,\" who had only supplied \"8ths and 4ths\" of a kilogram of cocaine. The court, however, was not persuaded. In imposing a sentence of 121 months, the sentencing judge made a general, and somewhat vague, reference to \"all [of] the testimony that the court received . . . in the course of trial.\" When defense counsel objected to this remark, the court clarified:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I said in the nature of the offense and my recollection of the testimony at trial. You are talking about 8ths and quarters, that was for a long time that cocaine was being supplied. So the amount of 3.5 from the evidence that I recall, is more than, I would say more than generous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on this exchange, it is clear that the district court mentioned the testimony it had heard at trial to emphasize that the court was familiar with both the length of time the conspiracy had operated and the quantity of drugs that had been involved. By doing so, the sentencing judge was responding to defense counsel's argument that her client was a \"peripheral supplier,\" who had supplied only small amounts of cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This information was hardly new to Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez and his counsel. <i>See id.</i> (requiring notice when a court expects to consider \"new information\" from a separate proceeding). The length of the conspiracy and quantity of drugs involved were set forth in the indictment, plea agreement, and PSR. The PSR noted that under the terms of the plea agreement, Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez had \"pled guilty in exchange for the stipulation of a lesser drug amount.\" Indeed, this information was at the heart of the government's argument that Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez was a \"significant\" supplier of cocaine. At his detention hearing, three days after Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez was arrested, the government was asked about the quantity of drugs Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez had supplied at any given time. The government responded that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez] has been involved since approximately 1992 or 1993 and . . . he has supplied kilogram quantities, perhaps not one kilo each time there's a drug transaction, perhaps half a kilo quantities, perhaps quarter of a kilo or eighth of a kilo quantities. But we're not talking grams here. We're talking kilo or portion of kilo quantities of both cocaine and heroin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notably, this is the same type of information that the court would later rely on at Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez's sentencing. Any factual information from the trial to which the court may have been referring, therefore, was neither new nor absent from the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, we are not persuaded by Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez's claim that he did not have a meaningful opportunity to respond to such information. Although Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez contends that he was blind-sided by the assertion that he was a \"significant\" supplier, the government consistently maintained, throughout the proceedings below, that Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez was a \"main supplier to the organization.\" At the bail review hearing on January 29, 2003, the government referred to Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez as a \"major cocaine supplier.\" In fact, even as early as the detention hearing on October 11, 2002, the government had described his role as a supplier to the organization as \"significant.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing, defense counsel anticipated this argument from the government, stating that she was \"sure the government [was] going to get up and say [her client] was one of the main suppliers.\" In an attempt to counter this claim, defense counsel argued that her client was only a \"peripheral supplier,\" minimizing the quantity of drugs that Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez had supplied. Thus, Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez clearly was on notice that this information was at issue during his sentencing, and he was given an opportunity to rebut it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, there is no indication from the record that the sentencing judge materially relied on any undisclosed testimony in deciding where to sentence Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez within the guideline range. <i>Id.</i> at 10. In imposing a sentence at the high-end of the guideline range, the district court stated that it had \"taken into consideration all of the elements in the presentence report[,] including the nature of the offense and all [of] the testimony that the court received . . . in the course of trial.\" After defense counsel challenged the court's reliance on the trial testimony, the court corrected her:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counsel, the sentence at the lower or upper end of the guideline range is discretionary. Taking into consideration the presentence report, the position of this defendant within the organizational chart which you knew, you had, [and] all [of] the evidence that I have before me. I am exercising my discretion and sentencing [Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez] to the upper end.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez's arguments to the contrary, it is clear from these comments that the district court did not <i>materially rely</i> on any specific testimony from the trial. Instead, as discussed above, the court made a general reference to the trial for the limited purpose of highlighting the length of the conspiracy and the amount of drugs involved. <i>See United States v. Fuentes-Moreno,</i> 895 F.2d 24, 26 (1st Cir. 1990) (finding no error in district court's \"general reference\" to the trial of Fuentes-Moreno's co-defendants in imposing sentence). Although the court mentioned trial testimony in deciding where to sentence Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez within the guideline range, the sentencing judge relied on record evidence, i.e., evidence that Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez was well aware of and had an opportunity to challenge and rebut at his sentencing. Accordingly, under these circumstances, we find no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Plea Agreement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez also argues that the government breached the plea agreement between the parties by urging the district court to impose a higher sentence than that which the government agreed to recommend, and by arguing that he was responsible for a quantity of cocaine greater than the amount stipulated. Specifically, Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez claims that the government breached the plea agreement by asking the court to find a base offense level of 38, as opposed to the level 30 contemplated by the agreement, and by stating that \"[t]here were quantities [of cocaine] frankly beyond the amount stipulated [to] in the plea agreement. . . .\" Again, however, we disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plea agreement between the parties stipulated that Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez would be held responsible for 3.5 to 5 kilograms of cocaine, yielding a base offense level of 30 under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(c)(5). The parties assumed that Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez would be found to have a Criminal History Category of I, making the applicable guideline range 97 to 121 months. Although the plea agreement warned Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez that his sentence was \"within the sound discretion of the sentencing judge,\" the agreement provided that the government would recommend 121 months of imprisonment, while Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez would request 97 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following defense counsel's argument for the low-end of the guideline range at the sentencing hearing, the government \"ask[ed] the court to impose the higher end of the sentencing guidelines, that being 121 months. . . .\" In support of this request, the government referred to the two-month trial of Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez's co-defendants, and stated that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">all [of] the evidence that the government has and presented at trial indicates that were this defendant to go to trial, the government would be seeking a [base offense] level [of] 38 to start with. <i>In this case we are seeking a much lower amount.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There were quantities frankly beyond the amount stipulated in the plea agreement and I submit that the government is bound by the plea agreement to recommend a maximum of <i>121 months</i> . . . . <i>I would ask the court to impose the sentence that the government now recommends.</i> (emphasis supplied).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily, whether the government has breached its plea agreement with a defendant is a question of law and our review is plenary. <i>See United States v. Doe,</i> 233 F.3d 642, 643-44 (1st Cir.2000) (citing <i>United States v. Clark,</i> 55 F.3d 9, 11 (1st Cir.1995)); <i>United States v. Canada,</i> 960 F.2d 263, 269 (1st Cir.1992). Where as here, however, the \"defendant has knowledge of conduct ostensibly amounting to a breach of a plea agreement, yet does not bring that breach to the attention of the sentencing court, we review only for plain error.\" <i>United States v. Saxena,</i> 229 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2000). Thus, we consider whether: (1) there was error, (2) it was plain, (3) the error affected the defendant's substantial rights, and (4) the error adversely impacted the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <i>United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <i>Saxena,</i> 229 F.3d at 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[W]hen a plea rests in any significant degree on a promise or agreement of the prosecutor, so that it can be said to be part of the inducement or consideration, such promise must be fulfilled.\" <i>Santobello v. New York,</i> 404 U.S. 257, 262, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971); <i>see United States v. Riggs,</i> 287 F.3d 221, 224 (1st Cir.2002); <i>Saxena,</i> 229 F.3d at 5-6. Because defendants must ultimately waive fundamental rights as a result of entering into any plea agreement, \"we hold prosecutors engaging in plea bargaining to `the most meticulous standards of both promise and performance.'\" <i>Riggs,</i> 287 F.3d at 224 (quoting <i>United States v. Velez Carrero,</i> 77 F.3d 11, 11 (1st Cir.1996)). This requirement prohibits, therefore, \"not only explicit repudiation of the government's assurances, but must in the interests of fairness be read to forbid end-runs around them.\" <i>United States v. Voccola,</i> 600 F.Supp. 1534, 1537 (D.R.I.1985), <i>quoted in United States v. Frazier,</i> 340 F.3d 5, 10 (1st Cir.2003); <i>Saxena,</i> 229 F.3d at 6; <i>Canada,</i> 960 F.2d at 269.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plea agreement expressly provided that the government would recommend a sentence at the high-end of the guideline range. This is exactly what it did. The government asked the court to impose a sentence of 121 months, not once, but twice during the course of its argument. <i>Cf. Canada,</i> 960 F.2d at 268 (finding that although \"the Assistant United States Attorney informed the court of the plea agreement and noted the existence therein of the government's promise to recommend only 36 months of incarceration, she never herself <i>affirmatively recommended</i> a 36 month sentence\") (emphasis supplied). Indeed, the government indicated that it was \"<i>bound by the plea agreement</i> to recommend a maximum of 121 months.\" Thus, the government did not technically violate the terms of the plea agreement. <i>See Frazier,</i> 340 F.3d at 12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government, however, \"cannot rely on mere technical compliance, and adherence to the terms of a plea agreement `requires more than lip service on a prosecutor's part.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Saxena,</i> 229 F.3d at 6). Although the government recommended a sentence of 121 months, it also informed the court that if the government had been forced to go to trial it would have sought a base offense level of 38. Moreover, as noted, the government stated that \"[t]here were quantities [of cocaine] frankly beyond the amount stipulated [to] in the plea agreement.\" Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez, therefore, argues that the government violated the spirit, if not the letter, of the plea agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the government's conduct here is somewhat troubling, we do not believe that these statements rise to the level of plain error. Despite the government's statement that it would seek a base offense level of 38 <i>if</i> it were forced to go to trial, the government reiterated that under the circumstances, it was \"seeking a much lower amount.\" Furthermore, having explicitly stated that it was recommending a sentence at the high-end of the guideline range, the government was free to offer reasons in support of that recommendation. <i>See United States v. Queensborough,</i> 227 F.3d 149, 157 (3rd Cir.2000). Thus, the government argued that Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez was a significant supplier of cocaine, and that \"[t]here were quantities frankly beyond the amount stipulated [to] in the plea agreement.\" It offered these reasons in response to defense counsel's argument that her client was a peripheral supplier, and in support of the government's request for a sentence at the high-end of the guideline range. Accordingly, under these circumstances, we can not say that the government's conduct at Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez's sentencing rises to the level of plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. Role Enhancement and <i>Booker</i> Remand</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez argues that the district court erred by imposing a two-level increase for his role in the offense pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(c). Although he concedes that he stipulated to his role in the offense as an \"organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor,\" Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez contends that there was insufficient evidence in the record to support the sentencing judge's determination that the enhancement was warranted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Additionally, Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez asks that his case be remanded to the district court for resentencing under <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), on the ground that there is a reasonable probability of a lower sentence under an advisory guidelines system. These arguments may be quickly dispatched.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Role Enhancement</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the bail review hearing on January 29, 2003, the government indicated that Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez was \"involved in the upper echelons of the [drug-trafficking] organization,\" and had delegated authority to others to make transactions on his behalf. The government also introduced an organizational chart of the conspiracy and asserted that Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez had acted as the \"right hand\" of the leader of the organization. According to the plea agreement, therefore, Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez received a two-level increase in his base offense level for his role in the offense as an \"organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor\" pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(c). At the sentencing hearing, the district court accepted this stipulation and applied the enhancement without making specific findings to support its conclusion. Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez did not object. On appeal, Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez now argues that there was no factual basis for his enhancement under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where a defendant fails to object in the district court to a sentencing enhancement, we review that enhancement only for plain error. <i>See United States v. Torres-Velazquez,</i> 480 F.3d 100, 103 (1st Cir. 2007). Ordinarily, defendants should be held to the terms of a plea agreement that they knowingly and voluntarily accept. <i>United States v. Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d 14, 28 (1st Cir.2001). A plea agreement is akin to a contract, \"binding upon the prosecution and the defense alike.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>United States v. Ortiz-Santiago,</i> 211 F.3d 146, 151 (1st Cir.2000)). Thus, although stipulations are normally not binding on a district court, should the court decide to accept and act upon a stipulation for sentencing purposes, the parties will usually be firmly bound. <i>Id.</i> at 28. We have acknowledged that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[t]his general rule will apply when, for example, a defendant stipulates to a matter of fact or to the applicability of a sentencing guideline (the legal meaning of which is pellucid) to the unique facts of her case. After all, the defendant knows what she has done, and has little cause for complaint if the district court takes her at her word.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> \"To hold anything else would be to reduce stipulations to mere inconsequential gestures.\" <i>United States v. Sandles,</i> 80 F.3d 1145, 1148 (7th Cir.1996). Moreover, even if Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez were not bound by his stipulation, we note that the record clearly supports the district court's determination. <i>See United States v. Garc&#237;a-Morales,</i> 382 F.3d 12, 20 (1st Cir. 2004); <i>United States v. Medina,</i> 167 F.3d 77, 80 (1st Cir.1999). Accordingly, the court's two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(c) was not in error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Booker Remand</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez contends that his case should be remanded to the district court for resentencing under <i>Booker,</i> on the ground that there is a reasonable probability of a lower sentence under an advisory guidelines system. Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez concedes, however, that he did not preserve his claim under <i>Booker;</i> we therefore review only for plain error. <i>See United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d 68, 75 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of his claim, Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez makes three arguments. First, he argues that the district court should not have relied solely on the guideline goals of deterrence and punishment, when under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a), a number of other factors must now be considered in setting the appropriate sentence. Second, he asserts that the sentencing judge would not have relied on testimony from the trial of Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez's co-defendants if he had known that his sentencing findings had to be supported by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Third, Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez argues that, under an advisory guidelines system, the district court is now free to consider personal characteristics and other mitigating factors that militate toward a more lenient sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez, however, \"has not shown a reasonable probability &#8212; not even a possibility &#8212; that the district court would have imposed a different (more lenient) sentence had it understood that the sentencing guidelines were advisory rather than mandatory.\" <i>United States v. Gonz&#225;lez-Mercado,</i> 402 F.3d 294, 303 (1st Cir. 2005). Pre-<i>Booker,</i> a district court was free to consider all of the factors listed in &#167; 3553(a) in determining an appropriate sentence within the applicable guideline range. The district court, here, noted that two of those factors, deterrence and punishment, were significant factors to be considered. The court's emphasis on deterrence and punishment, however, does not mean that it did not consider the other enumerated factors in arriving at the appropriate sentence. In this instance, it only means that the court believed that deterrence and punishment were particularly relevant in Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez's circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez's second argument, that the district court would not have relied on testimony from the trial of Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez's co-defendants had it known that its sentencing findings had to be supported by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, is based on a false assumption: post-<i>Booker,</i> a district court's sentencing findings need not be supported by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>See Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 75 (\"The error is not that a judge (by a preponderance of the evidence) determined facts under the Guidelines which increased a sentence beyond that authorized by the jury verdict or an admission by the defendant; the error is only that the judge did so in a mandatory Guidelines system.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez's third argument fails as well. Pre-<i>Booker,</i> a district court had discretion to consider a defendant's personal characteristics in deciding where to sentence the defendant within the guideline range. <i>See, e.g.,</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 5H1.1-12. Indeed, defense counsel argued at the sentencing hearing that Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez was a first time offender, had a stable marriage and a substantial job history, voluntarily abandoned the conspiracy well before his arrest, and had undertaken rehabilitation efforts in prison. The district court, however, was not persuaded. Given that the court sentenced Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez to the high-end of the guideline range, it is likely that the court would impose the same sentence under an advisory system. <i>See Gonz&#225;lez-Mercado,</i> 402 F.3d at 304 (\"When, under a mandatory guidelines regime, a sentencing court has elected to sentence the defendant substantially above the bottom of the range, that is a telling indication that the court, if acting under an advisory guidelines regime, would in all likelihood have imposed the same sentence.\"). Accordingly, we find that Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez has failed to show a reasonable probability of a more lenient sentence on remand.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons set forth above, we affirm Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez's sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Count Two (a property forfeiture charge) was dismissed as to Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez and, consequently, is not a subject of this appeal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Although not contemplated in the plea agreement, the PSR also included a two-level increase to Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez's base offense level for possession of a firearm under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1).

Washington,</i> 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). This argument, however, is clearly baseless. <i>See United States v.

On September 26, 2002, following a two-year investigation by federal and local law enforcement agencies, a federal grand jury returned a two-count indictment against Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez and forty-two co-defendants. Count One of the indictment alleged that from approximately April 28, 1993, to September 26, 2002, the defendants conspired to possess with intent to distribute controlled substances in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(A).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the indictment, Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez supplied heroin and cocaine to the drug-trafficking organization.

The parties agreed that Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez would be held responsible for 3.5 to 5 kilograms of cocaine, which yielded a base offense level of 30 under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(c)(5). The parties also stipulated that Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez would receive a two-level increase for his role in the offense as \"an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor\" pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(c), and a two-level decrease for his acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties anticipated a Criminal History Category of I, making the applicable sentencing range 97 to 121 months. Although the plea agreement warned Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez that his sentence was \"within the sound discretion of the sentencing judge,\" the parties agreed that the government would recommend 121 months of incarceration, while Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez would request 97 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The presentence report (\"PSR\") adopted the guideline calculations agreed to by the parties in the plea agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The PSR described Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez as \"the cocaine and marihuana supplier to the organization.\" Notably, the PSR stated that, as one of the suppliers to the drug-trafficking organization, Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez was \"more culpable\" than those members of the conspiracy who sold the narcotics. The PSR also noted that under the terms of the plea agreement, Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez had \"pled guilty in exchange for the stipulation of a lesser drug amount.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing on November 7, 2003, the court accepted the guideline calculations agreed to by the parties and adopted by the PSR. Defense counsel asked the court to sentence Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez to the low-end of the guideline range, or 97 months. In support of this request for a sentence at the low-end of the guideline range, defense counsel noted that Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez had a long-term, stable marriage and a six-year-old daughter. Counsel also argued that, despite having only a ninth grade education, Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez had worked as a land surveyor, and had owned and operated a small grocery store since 2000. Defense counsel informed the court that she had information that a witness at the trial of several of Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez's co-defendants had \"testified to the fact that after [Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez] engaged in his [grocery] business, he withdrew from the conspiracy.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In arguing for the low-end of the guideline range, defense counsel also asserted that the pre-trial discovery provided by the government showed that Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez was only a \"peripheral supplier.\" Defense counsel stated that \"the evidence against [Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez] consisted of two or three witnesses saying that he had supplied 8ths and 4ths [of a kilogram], and that is the reason why the quantity of 3.5 to 5 kilograms of cocaine was stipulated [to] in the plea agreement.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In closing, defense counsel observed that Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez was a first-time offender and had shown a willingness to rehabilitate. She also noted that he \"was one of the first defendants to come forward and accept his responsibility.\" Accordingly, defense counsel asked the court to consider a sentence at the low-end of the guideline range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government, on the other hand, asked the court to sentence Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez to the high-end of the guideline range.

I submit that the testimony, [pre-trial discovery], and all [of] the evidence that the government has and presented at trial indicates that were this defendant to go to trial, the government would be seeking a [base offense] level [of] 38 to start with.

The court explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I said in the nature of the offense and my recollection of the testimony at trial.

I was not privy to that information and I don't think it is fair that I am standing here requesting . . . the . . . lower end of the guideline [range] and then not have that information to be able to refute that. I am sure there were other suppliers in the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The court declined to reconsider:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counsel, the sentence at the lower or upper end of the guideline range is discretionary.

The court noted, however, that \"one of the main purposes of sentencing considerations now under this Congress, under these sentencing guidelines[,] is deterrence and punishment,\" and explained that the court had considered the factors cited by defense counsel \"by not doing [its] own sentencing guideline calculation and imposing a much higher guideline [sic] based on the evidence that [it had].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez assigns three errors on appeal. First, he contends that the district court erred by failing to give him notice that the court intended to rely on testimony from his co-defendants' trial in deciding where to sentence him within the guideline range. Second, Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez argues that the government breached its plea agreement with him by urging the court to impose a higher sentence than that which the government agreed to recommend, and by arguing that he was responsible for a quantity of cocaine greater than the amount stipulated. Finally, Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez claims that the court erred by imposing a two-level increase for his role in the offense pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(c), and asks that his case be remanded to the district court for resentencing under <i>United States v.

At issue was defendant Robert Berzon's claim that the district court had based its upward adjustment of his base offense level on testimony from a co-defendant's sentencing hearing that neither Berzon nor his attorney had attended. The testimony offered new and substantial information about Berzon's role in the offense as a leader or organizer under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(c). Berzon contended, however, that he had no knowledge of the damaging testimony at the time of his own sentencing.

According to Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez, the district court erred when it failed to notify him that it would rely on testimony from his co-defendants' trial in deciding where to sentence him within the guideline range. He claims that he had no knowledge of the prior trial testimony and argues that he was blind-sided by the contention that he was a significant supplier of drugs to the conspiracy. As a result, Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez argues that he was denied the opportunity to challenge and rebut the court's reliance on such information in violation of Fed. R.Crim.P. 32 and his right to due process under the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez's reliance on <i>Berzon,</i> however, is misplaced. One of our concerns in <i>Berzon</i> was that the undisclosed testimony at issue contained <i>new</i> and <i>significant</i> information about Berzon's role in the offense &#8212; information that was nowhere in the record and which Berzon had no opportunity to challenge. <i>Id.</i> at 17. The same can not be said here. At the sentencing hearing on November 7, 2003, defense counsel argued that her client was a \"peripheral supplier,\" who had only supplied \"8ths and 4ths\" of a kilogram of cocaine. The court, however, was not persuaded. In imposing a sentence of 121 months, the sentencing judge made a general, and somewhat vague, reference to \"all [of] the testimony that the court received . . . in the course of trial.\" When defense counsel objected to this remark, the court clarified:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I said in the nature of the offense and my recollection of the testimony at trial. You are talking about 8ths and quarters, that was for a long time that cocaine was being supplied. So the amount of 3.5 from the evidence that I recall, is more than, I would say more than generous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on this exchange, it is clear that the district court mentioned the testimony it had heard at trial to emphasize that the court was familiar with both the length of time the conspiracy had operated and the quantity of drugs that had been involved. By doing so, the sentencing judge was responding to defense counsel's argument that her client was a \"peripheral supplier,\" who had supplied only small amounts of cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This information was hardly new to Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez and his counsel. <i>See id.</i> (requiring notice when a court expects to consider \"new information\" from a separate proceeding). The length of the conspiracy and quantity of drugs involved were set forth in the indictment, plea agreement, and PSR. The PSR noted that under the terms of the plea agreement, Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez had \"pled guilty in exchange for the stipulation of a lesser drug amount.\" Indeed, this information was at the heart of the government's argument that Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez was a \"significant\" supplier of cocaine. At his detention hearing, three days after Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez was arrested, the government was asked about the quantity of drugs Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez had supplied at any given time. The government responded that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez] has been involved since approximately 1992 or 1993 and . . . he has supplied kilogram quantities, perhaps not one kilo each time there's a drug transaction, perhaps half a kilo quantities, perhaps quarter of a kilo or eighth of a kilo quantities. But we're not talking grams here. We're talking kilo or portion of kilo quantities of both cocaine and heroin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notably, this is the same type of information that the court would later rely on at Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez's sentencing. Any factual information from the trial to which the court may have been referring, therefore, was neither new nor absent from the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, we are not persuaded by Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez's claim that he did not have a meaningful opportunity to respond to such information. Although Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez contends that he was blind-sided by the assertion that he was a \"significant\" supplier, the government consistently maintained, throughout the proceedings below, that Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez was a \"main supplier to the organization.\" At the bail review hearing on January 29, 2003, the government referred to Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez as a \"major cocaine supplier.\" In fact, even as early as the detention hearing on October 11, 2002, the government had described his role as a supplier to the organization as \"significant.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing, defense counsel anticipated this argument from the government, stating that she was \"sure the government [was] going to get up and say [her client] was one of the main suppliers.\" In an attempt to counter this claim, defense counsel argued that her client was only a \"peripheral supplier,\" minimizing the quantity of drugs that Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez had supplied. Thus, Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez clearly was on notice that this information was at issue during his sentencing, and he was given an opportunity to rebut it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, there is no indication from the record that the sentencing judge materially relied on any undisclosed testimony in deciding where to sentence Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez within the guideline range. <i>Id.</i> at 10. In imposing a sentence at the high-end of the guideline range, the district court stated that it had \"taken into consideration all of the elements in the presentence report[,] including the nature of the offense and all [of] the testimony that the court received . . . in the course of trial.\" After defense counsel challenged the court's reliance on the trial testimony, the court corrected her:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counsel, the sentence at the lower or upper end of the guideline range is discretionary. Taking into consideration the presentence report, the position of this defendant within the organizational chart which you knew, you had, [and] all [of] the evidence that I have before me. I am exercising my discretion and sentencing [Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez] to the upper end.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez's arguments to the contrary, it is clear from these comments that the district court did not <i>materially rely</i> on any specific testimony from the trial. Instead, as discussed above, the court made a general reference to the trial for the limited purpose of highlighting the length of the conspiracy and the amount of drugs involved. <i>See United States v. Fuentes-Moreno,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536028\"><a href=\"/opinion/536028/united-states-v-yessid-fuentes-moreno/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir. 1990) (finding no error in district court's \"general reference\" to the trial of Fuentes-Moreno's co-defendants in imposing sentence). Although the court mentioned trial testimony in deciding where to sentence Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez within the guideline range, the sentencing judge relied on record evidence, i.e., evidence that Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez was well aware of and had an opportunity to challenge and rebut at his sentencing. Accordingly, under these circumstances, we find no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Plea Agreement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez also argues that the government breached the plea agreement between the parties by urging the district court to impose a higher sentence than that which the government agreed to recommend, and by arguing that he was responsible for a quantity of cocaine greater than the amount stipulated. Specifically, Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez claims that the government breached the plea agreement by asking the court to find a base offense level of 38, as opposed to the level 30 contemplated by the agreement, and by stating that \"[t]here were quantities [of cocaine] frankly beyond the amount stipulated [to] in the plea agreement. . . .\" Again, however, we disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plea agreement between the parties stipulated that Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez would be held responsible for 3.5 to 5 kilograms of cocaine, yielding a base offense level of 30 under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(c)(5). The parties assumed that Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez would be found to have a Criminal History Category of I, making the applicable guideline range 97 to 121 months. Although the plea agreement warned Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez that his sentence was \"within the sound discretion of the sentencing judge,\" the agreement provided that the government would recommend 121 months of imprisonment, while Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez would request 97 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following defense counsel's argument for the low-end of the guideline range at the sentencing hearing, the government \"ask[ed] the court to impose the higher end of the sentencing guidelines, that being 121 months. . . .\" In support of this request, the government referred to the two-month trial of Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez's co-defendants, and stated that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">all [of] the evidence that the government has and presented at trial indicates that were this defendant to go to trial, the government would be seeking a [base offense] level [of] 38 to start with. <i>In this case we are seeking a much lower amount.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There were quantities frankly beyond the amount stipulated in the plea agreement and I submit that the government is bound by the plea agreement to recommend a maximum of <i>121 months</i> . . . . <i>I would ask the court to impose the sentence that the government now recommends.</i> (emphasis supplied).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily, whether the government has breached its plea agreement with a defendant is a question of law and our review is plenary. <i>See United States v.

This is exactly what it did. The government asked the court to impose a sentence of 121 months, not once, but twice during the course of its argument. <i>Cf. Canada,</i> 960 F.2d at 268 (finding that although \"the Assistant United States Attorney informed the court of the plea agreement and noted the existence therein of the government's promise to recommend only 36 months of incarceration, she never herself <i>affirmatively recommended</i> a 36 month sentence\") (emphasis supplied). Indeed, the government indicated that it was \"<i>bound by the plea agreement</i> to recommend a maximum of 121 months.\" Thus, the government did not technically violate the terms of the plea agreement. <i>See Frazier,</i> 340 F.3d at 12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government, however, \"cannot rely on mere technical compliance, and adherence to the terms of a plea agreement `requires more than lip service on a prosecutor's part.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Saxena,</i> 229 F.3d at 6). Although the government recommended a sentence of 121 months, it also informed the court that if the government had been forced to go to trial it would have sought a base offense level of 38. Moreover, as noted, the government stated that \"[t]here were quantities [of cocaine] frankly beyond the amount stipulated [to] in the plea agreement.\" Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez, therefore, argues that the government violated the spirit, if not the letter, of the plea agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the government's conduct here is somewhat troubling, we do not believe that these statements rise to the level of plain error. Despite the government's statement that it would seek a base offense level of 38 <i>if</i> it were forced to go to trial, the government reiterated that under the circumstances, it was \"seeking a much lower amount.\" Furthermore, having explicitly stated that it was recommending a sentence at the high-end of the guideline range, the government was free to offer reasons in support of that recommendation. <i>See United States v.

Thus, the government argued that Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez was a significant supplier of cocaine, and that \"[t]here were quantities frankly beyond the amount stipulated [to] in the plea agreement.\" It offered these reasons in response to defense counsel's argument that her client was a peripheral supplier, and in support of the government's request for a sentence at the high-end of the guideline range. Accordingly, under these circumstances, we can not say that the government's conduct at Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez's sentencing rises to the level of plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C.

Although he concedes that he stipulated to his role in the offense as an \"organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor,\" Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez contends that there was insufficient evidence in the record to support the sentencing judge's determination that the enhancement was warranted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Additionally, Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez asks that his case be remanded to the district court for resentencing under <i>United States v.

The government also introduced an organizational chart of the conspiracy and asserted that Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez had acted as the \"right hand\" of the leader of the organization. According to the plea agreement, therefore, Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez received a two-level increase in his base offense level for his role in the offense as an \"organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor\" pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(c). At the sentencing hearing, the district court accepted this stipulation and applied the enhancement without making specific findings to support its conclusion. Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez did not object. On appeal, Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez now argues that there was no factual basis for his enhancement under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where a defendant fails to object in the district court to a sentencing enhancement, we review that enhancement only for plain error. <i>See United States v.

Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez concedes, however, that he did not preserve his claim under <i>Booker;</i> we therefore review only for plain error. <i>See United States v.

First, he argues that the district court should not have relied solely on the guideline goals of deterrence and punishment, when under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a), a number of other factors must now be considered in setting the appropriate sentence. Second, he asserts that the sentencing judge would not have relied on testimony from the trial of Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez's co-defendants if he had known that his sentencing findings had to be supported by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Third, Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez argues that, under an advisory guidelines system, the district court is now free to consider personal characteristics and other mitigating factors that militate toward a more lenient sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez, however, \"has not shown a reasonable probability &#8212; not even a possibility &#8212; that the district court would have imposed a different (more lenient) sentence had it understood that the sentencing guidelines were advisory rather than mandatory.\" <i>United States v.

Pre-<i>Booker,</i> a district court was free to consider all of the factors listed in &#167; 3553(a) in determining an appropriate sentence within the applicable guideline range. The district court, here, noted that two of those factors, deterrence and punishment, were significant factors to be considered. The court's emphasis on deterrence and punishment, however, does not mean that it did not consider the other enumerated factors in arriving at the appropriate sentence. In this instance, it only means that the court believed that deterrence and punishment were particularly relevant in Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez's circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez's second argument, that the district court would not have relied on testimony from the trial of Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez's co-defendants had it known that its sentencing findings had to be supported by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, is based on a false assumption: post-<i>Booker,</i> a district court's sentencing findings need not be supported by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>See Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 75 (\"The error is not that a judge (by a preponderance of the evidence) determined facts under the Guidelines which increased a sentence beyond that authorized by the jury verdict or an admission by the defendant; the error is only that the judge did so in a mandatory Guidelines system.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez's third argument fails as well. Pre-<i>Booker,</i> a district court had discretion to consider a defendant's personal characteristics in deciding where to sentence the defendant within the guideline range. <i>See, e.g.,</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 5H1.1-12. Indeed, defense counsel argued at the sentencing hearing that Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez was a first time offender, had a stable marriage and a substantial job history, voluntarily abandoned the conspiracy well before his arrest, and had undertaken rehabilitation efforts in prison. The district court, however, was not persuaded. Given that the court sentenced Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez to the high-end of the guideline range, it is likely that the court would impose the same sentence under an advisory system. <i>See Gonz&#225;lez-Mercado,</i> 402 F.3d at 304 (\"When, under a mandatory guidelines regime, a sentencing court has elected to sentence the defendant substantially above the bottom of the range, that is a telling indication that the court, if acting under an advisory guidelines regime, would in all likelihood have imposed the same sentence.\"). Accordingly, we find that Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez has failed to show a reasonable probability of a more lenient sentence on remand.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons set forth above, we affirm Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez's sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Count Two (a property forfeiture charge) was dismissed as to Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez and, consequently, is not a subject of this appeal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Although not contemplated in the plea agreement, the PSR also included a two-level increase to Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez's base offense level for possession of a firearm under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1).
