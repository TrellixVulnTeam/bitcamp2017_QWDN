Schlacter on brief for appellees in their official\ncapacities.\n\fSeptember 4, 2002\n\f            Per Curiam.   Plaintiff Siddhartha Basu brought suit for\n\nconspiracy, false arrest, false imprisonment, abuse of process and\n\nmalicious   prosecution   against    Cambridge    firefighters   Laurence\n\nBrogan and Richard Dahl.     These claims arose from a 1997 incident\n\nin which the firefighters told police that Basu had deliberately\n\nstruck Brogan with his car, leading to Basu's arrest. The district\n\ncourt entered summary judgment for defendants.        We affirm.\n\n            Our review of the grant of summary judgment is de novo\n\nand we take all factual inferences in the light most favorable to\n\nthe non-moving party.     McCarthy v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., 56\n\nF.3d 313, 315 (1st Cir. 1995).\n            On November 15, 1997, Brogan and Dahl responded to a fire\n\nat a building in Cambridge, Massachusetts.        Basu, a tenant, drove\nhis car out of the building's garage.        A fire truck blocked the\ngarage exit, so Basu stopped his car on the sidewalk and asked\n\nBrogan to move the truck.      Brogan, seeing that Basu's car would\nobstruct the progress of an approaching blind pedestrian and a\nwoman who was assisting this pedestrian, asked that Basu first back\nhis car away from the sidewalk.           Brogan says he had to make\n\nseveral, increasingly forceful requests.         Eventually, Basu backed\nhis car up a short distance.\n\n            Once the pedestrians walked past, Basu drove his car\nforward.    Brogan says he felt the car strike him from behind,\nknocking him onto or over the hood and then to the ground.           Dahl\n\nand Thomas MacNeil, also a firefighter, say that Basu's vehicle\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fknocked Brogan to the ground and continued to pull forward until\n\nBrogan reached into the car, grasped Basu, and ordered him to stop.\n\nBasu testified that his car did not make contact with Brogan, who\n\nhe says was standing safely to the left.\n\n          Someone on the scene called the police.         Two police\n\nofficers promptly arrived; the firefighters told an officer that\n\nBasu intentionally had struck Brogan with his car from behind. The\n\nofficers arrested Basu.\n\n          Basu was charged with assault and battery by means of a\n\ndangerous weapon and cited for driving to endanger.    Nine months\nlater, prosecutors filed a nolle prosequi dismissing the assault\n\nand battery charge.   The government said it withdrew the citation\nbecause of a technical defect.\n          Two years later, plaintiff brought this action under 42\n\nU.S.C. ยง 1983 (2000), with pendent state law claims.\n\n1.        Federal Civil Rights Conspiracy and State Conspiracy\n\n          A principal element of a 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 conspiracy is\nan agreement between the parties to inflict a wrong or injury upon\nanother in violation of that person's civil rights.        Earle v.\n\nBenoit, 850 F.2d 836, 844 (1st Cir. 1988).   The pendent state law\n\nconspiracy claim requires that plaintiff show that the defendants\n\nestablished \"'a common plan to commit a tortious act.'\"    Kurker v.\n\nHill, 44 Mass. App. Ct. 184, 689 N.E.2d 833, 837 (1998) (quoting\n\nStock v. Fife, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 75, 430 N.E.2d 845, 849 (1982)).\n\nThere is no evidence that in the heat of the moment Brogan and Dahl\n\narrived at an agreement or \"common plan\" to offer false statements\n\n                                 -4-\n\fthat would lead to Basu's arrest. The police officers arrived very\n\nshortly after the car incident and immediately interviewed the\n\nfirefighters.   Indeed, Basu himself agreed that the police should\nbe called.\n\n2.        False Arrest and False Imprisonment (Federal and State)\n\n          Brogan and Dahl are firefighters, not police officers,\n\nand they neither arrested nor imprisoned Basu.    Any liability must\n\nrest then on the theory that they induced the officers to make an\n\narrest, that the officers acted not of their own volition but\n\nbecause of the defendants' request.    Rarely successful, but see\n\nWagenmann v. Adams, 829 F.2d 196, 209-10 (1st Cir. 1987), the\n\ntheory usually fails, see, e.g., Tomaiolo v. Mallinoff, 281 F.3d 1,\n10 (1st Cir. 2002).    That is because citizens, including public\nemployees, have a perfect right to complain to and seek the\n\nprotection of the police about possible crimes.   Massachusetts law\non this point may be less favorable to plaintiffs; it is certainly\nnot more favorable.    See Mezullo v. Maletz, 331 Mass. 233, 118\n\nN.E.2d 356, 359 (1954) (\"One who procures the arrest or confinement\nof another on lawful process is not liable to an action of false\nimprisonment, although he caused the process to issue by means of\n\nfalse statements.\"); Zinkfein v. W.T. Grant Co., 236 Mass. 228, 128\n\nN.E. 24, 26 (1920) (\"In an action for false imprisonment, where a\nwrongful arrest has been made on information given by a defendant,\n\nthere is no liability on the part of the informant for the arrest\nunless the officer acted under the direction of the defendant or as\n\nhis agent.\").   Here, unlike Wagenmann, the arrest was supported by\n\n                                -5-\n\fprobable cause, there was no evidence of overweening influence on\n\nthe officers, and there was no evidence of conspiracy.         That dooms\n\nthe claim.\n           Nonetheless, Basu focuses on the truth of the statements\n\nmade to police. Basu's evidence would not permit a reasonable jury\n\nto find that Brogan and Dahl lied about the alleged assault or that\nthey wanted to induce Basu's confinement.           The police did arrest\n\nBasu because Brogan and Dahl and other firefighters told the police\n\nofficers     at   the    scene   that   plaintiff    had   struck   Brogan\n\ndeliberately.     That is far from enough.     See, e.g., Roche v. John\n\nHancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., 81 F.3d 249 (1st Cir. 1996) (upholding\n\nsummary judgment dismissing false arrest claim against private\n\nparty where police arrested plaintiff on basis of statements\noffered by defendant).       Basu relies primarily on the videotape of\n\nthe incident and the \"changes\" in Brogan's testimony after he saw\n\nthe videotape to argue it is clear that he did not hit Brogan, so\nthe claim that he did must be false.         Neither the videotape nor\n\nBrogan's testimony create an issue of material fact. The videotape\n\nis inconclusive, because of the time gaps between frames.\n\n             Brogan's testimony is not inconsistent.        In the report\n\nBrogan prepared on the day of the incident, he describes himself as\n\nbeing sent \"up upon the hood of the car,\" but in the deposition\n\ngiven after Brogan had viewed the videotape, he says that he was\n\nsent \"over the hood.\"        However, Brogan used both phrases in his\n\ninitial report.         Plaintiff also has not contested defendants'\n\nevidence that just hours after the incident the fire department\n\n                                    -6-\n\fgave Brogan medical leave -- which lasted three months, while he\n\nreceived regular physical therapy and other medical attention. The\n\nstatements of Brogan, Dahl, and MacNeil are internally consistent\nand corroborate each other.         Plaintiff has not created an issue of\n\nmaterial fact that the statements given by the firefighters were\n\nfalse.\n\n3.           Abuse of Process (State Law)\n\n             The elements of a Massachusetts abuse of process claim\n\nare \"(1) that process is used (2) for an ulterior or illegitimate\n\npurpose, (3) resulting in damage to the plaintiff.\"                   Refuse &\n\nEnvtl. Sys., Inc. v. Indus. Servs. of Am., Inc., 932 F.2d 37, 41\n\n(1st Cir. 1991); see Jones v. Brockton Pub. Mkts., Inc., 369 Mass.\n387,   340    N.E.2d   484,   485   (1975).       As   the   discussion     above\ndemonstrates, there was no evidence from which a reasonable jury\n\ncould conclude that there was an abuse of process.\n\n4.           Malicious Prosecution (State Law)\n\n             To make out his pendent malicious prosecution claim under\nstate law, \"a plaintiff must establish that the criminal action was\nbrought      maliciously,     without    probable      cause,   and   has   been\nterminated in favor of the plaintiff.\"            Wynne v. Rosen, 391 Mass.\n\n797, 464 N.E.2d 1348, 1350 (1984).            There is no evidence of malice\n\nand the officers had probable cause.\n\n             Affirmed. Costs are awarded to defendants.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\f",
