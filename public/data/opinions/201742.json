R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                       For the First Circuit\n\nNo. 03-1425\n\n                             UNITED STATES,\n\n                                Appellee,\n\n                                     v.\n\n                              JOSE GUZMAN,\n\n                        Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n       [Hon. Carmen Consuelo Cerezo, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Jane Elizabeth Lee on brief for appellant.\n     H.S. Garcia, United States Attorney, and Nelson Perez-Sosa,\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                             August 4, 2005\n\f     Per Curiam. Jose Guzman appeals from his sentence.                While his\n\nappeal    was   pending,     the   Supreme     Court    decided   Blakely       v.\n\nWashington,     124 S. Ct. 2531 (2004), and United States v. Booker,\n\n542 U.S. ___, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005).         Guzman has filed supplemental\n\nbriefs raising claims under both Blakely and Booker.              Guzman pled\n\nguilty to conspiring to possess with intent to distribute and to\n\ndistribute more than five kilograms of cocaine, in violation of 21\n\nU.S.C. § 841(a)(1).        The statutory mandatory minimum sentence for\n\nthe offense to which he pled guilty is ten years' imprisonment. See\n\n21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A)(ii). Guzman received a prison sentence of\n\nten years. Those three undisputed facts dispose of all of Guzman's\n\nclaims.\n\n     I. Original Claim: Breach of Plea Agreement\n\n     Guzman's original claim was that the government had breached\n\nits plea agreement with him by referring in its amended motion\n\npursuant to U.S.S.G. §5K1.1 to a Guidelines sentencing range beyond\n\nwhat the plea agreement had contemplated.                 He sought specific\n\nperformance     of   the    plea   agreement    and     resentencing     with    a\n\nrecommendation by the government for a sentence based on a base\n\noffense level of 32.\n\n     It is unnecessary to decide whether the government breached\n\nthe plea agreement by referring in its amended § 5K1.1 motion to a\n\nguideline     imprisonment     range    of   262   to    327   months,     which\n\ncorresponded with the offense level calculated under § 4B1.1, the\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fcareer offender Guidelines provision, rather than with the offense\n\nlevel calculated under § 2D1.1, based on drug quantity (which would\n\nyield an imprisonment range of 151 - 188 months).                 Guzman concedes\n\nthat the issue was not raised below and, therefore, that plain\n\nerror review applies.       Even if there had been a breach, Guzman\n\ncannot   satisfy   the   third    prong    of    plain    error    review,   which\n\nrequires a showing that the error \"affects substantial rights.\"\n\nUnited States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732 (1993).\n\n     The government neither agreed to request nor requested a\n\ndeparture in accord with 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e), below the statutory\n\nmandatory minimum sentence.          The government requested that the\n\nsentencing court depart below the applicable Guidelines sentencing\n\nrange to impose a sentence of 120 months, the statutory mandatory\n\nminimum.   The sentencing court granted that request.                  Therefore,\n\nGuzman has not shown that the alleged breach affected his sentence.\n\n     II. Blakely/Booker Claims\n\n     In his first supplemental brief, Guzman argues that his\n\nsentence is invalid under Blakely because the facts underlying his\n\ncareer offender enhancement (specifically his age and the fact of\n\nhis prior offenses) were not found by a jury or admitted by him.\n\nIn his second supplemental brief, he argues that he is entitled to\n\nremand for resentencing under Booker because he was sentenced under\n\na   mandatory   Guidelines       system    and    there     was    a   reasonable\n\nprobability that he would receive a lighter sentence under an\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fadvisory Guidelines system.           Neither claim has merit.\n\n       Guzman received the mandatory minimum statutory sentence for\n\nthe offense to which he pled guilty, i.e., conspiring to possess\n\nwith       intent   to   distribute   and   to   distribute   more    than   five\n\nkilograms of cocaine.         Therefore, there was no enhancement of his\n\nsentence based on judge-found facts. \"A mandatory minimum sentence\n\nimposed as required by a statute based on facts found by a jury or\n\nadmitted by a defendant is not a candidate for Booker error.\"\n\nAntonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 75; see United States v. Bermudez, 2005\n\nWL 1208131, No. 04-1222, slip op. at 19-20 (1st Cir. May 23, 2005).\n\n       In addition, \"the rationale of Apprendi does not apply to\n\nsentence-enhancement          provisions      based   upon    prior    criminal\n\nconvictions.\" United States v. Moore, 286 F.3d 47, 51 (1st Cir.\n\n2002); see also United States v. Stearns, 387 F.3d 104, 107 (1st\n\nCir. 2004) (holding that the fact of a prior conviction is beyond\n\nthe ambit of Blakely), cert. denied, __ U.S. __, 125 S. Ct. 1614\n\n(2005).        Post-Booker it remains the law that \"prior criminal\n\nconvictions are not facts that a jury must find beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.\" United States v. Lewis, 406 F.3d 11, 21 n. 11 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).1\n\n\n       1\n       To the extent that Guzman based his Blakely claim on the\njudicial factfinding with respect to his age at the time the\noffense was committed, that argument is frivolous. Guzman did not\nobject below to the PSR's reporting of his birth date as 1966\n(making him 35 at the time the offense was committed). \"In the\npost-Apprendi world, this court adopted a rule that any such error\nin sentencing should be held harmless so long as the evidence of\n\n                                        -4-\n\f     Defendant-Appellant's Motion to Proffer Facts Not on the\n\nRecord is granted.   Guzman's conviction and sentence are affirmed.\n\nSee 1st Cir. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\nthe trial judge's factual findings is overwhelming and no\nreasonable jury could have disagreed with them.\" United States v.\nMorgan, 384 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                                -5-\n\f",
