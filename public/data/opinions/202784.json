Kessler, Assistant Attorney General,    Civil Division,\nTerri J. Scadron, Assistant Director, Office          of Immigration\nLitigation, and Genevieve Holm, Attorney, Office       of Immigration\nLitigation, on brief for respondent.\n\n\n\n                           June 7, 2007\n\f           SELYA, Senior Circuit Judge.       Claiming to be a religious\n\nrefugee from his native China, the petitioner, Jian Pan, sought\n\nasylum, withholding of removal, or protection under the Convention\n\nAgainst Torture (CAT). An Immigration Judge (IJ), finding that the\n\npetitioner's religious persecution claim lacked both credibility\n\nand substance, ordered his removal.           The Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals (BIA) summarily affirmed this ukase.         The petitioner now\n\nseeks judicial review.     We deny the petition.\n\n           When and how the petitioner arrived in the United States\n\nare hotly contested issues.       It is clear, however, that he was here\n\non May 28, 2002, when he initially applied for asylum.          He alleged\n\nthe following facts.\n\n           On July 20, 2001, four policemen forcibly entered a\n\nprivate residence in Changle, China, where the petitioner, his\n\nfather,   and   other   persons    were   participating   in   a   peaceful\n\nChristian \"home church\" gathering.         The officers questioned the\n\npetitioner with respect to his membership in the home church and\n\nits connection to a \"Taiwan anti[-]government group.\"              Fourteen\n\npeople, including the petitioner and his father, were detained at\n\nthe local police station.          There, the police interrogated the\n\npetitioner; angered by his responses one officer slapped his face,\n\nkicked him from his stool, and beat him with a baton.          On the third\n\nof his eleven days in detention, the police handcuffed him to a\n\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fpole behind the station house and forced him to stand overnight in\n\nthe rain. His mother eventually posted bail to secure his release.\n\n            The petitioner claims to have fled from China on August\n\n26, 2001, with the assistance of a snakehead (a professional\n\nsmuggler).       He says that he left in the nick of time; shortly after\n\nhis departure, Chinese authorities consigned both his father and\n\nthe host of the home church to a labor camp.              According to his\n\naccount, he arrived in the United States on August 28, 2001, and\n\nentered illegally.\n\n            The next material development occurred nine months later,\n\nwhen the petitioner self-reported to immigration authorities and\n\nsought asylum.        On August 1, 2002, the former Immigration and\n\nNaturalization       Service   conducted    an   asylum   interview.        The\n\ninterviewer (whom we shall refer to as the asylum officer) found\n\nthat the petitioner was not credible, that both his chronology of\n\nevents and his account of what had transpired were flawed, and that\n\nhe had failed to show that his application for asylum was filed\n\nwithin one year of his arrival in the United States (as required by\n\nlaw).      The    asylum   officer   then   referred   the   matter    to   the\n\nImmigration Court for the institution of removal proceedings.\n\n            The petitioner, who had traveled to the United States on\n\na fraudulent passport, conceded removability. At the same time, he\n\ncross-applied for asylum, withholding of removal, or relief under\n\nthe CAT.     Following a series of evidentiary hearings, the IJ\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fconcluded that the petitioner had failed to carry the devoir of\n\npersuasion on any of his three claims for relief.                  The IJ's\n\nconclusion flowed in large measure from an adverse credibility\n\ndetermination.      In that regard, the IJ zeroed in on a number of\n\ndiscrepancies in the petitioner's tale.\n\n           First,    she   noted   that       the   petitioner    had   given\n\nconflicting accounts anent a taxi receipt introduced in the hope of\n\nshowing his presence in China on August 26, 2001 (a date within the\n\none-year   eligibility     period).         Specifically,   the   petitioner\n\ntestified before the IJ that he had carried the receipt out of\n\nChina himself, whereas he had told the asylum officer that his\n\nmother had mailed the receipt to him from China some time after his\n\narrival in the United States.\n\n           Second, the IJ found that the petitioner's testimony\n\nregarding the manner of his entry into and travel about the United\n\nStates was wildly inconsistent.             Before the IJ, the petitioner\n\ntestified that he flew from Shanghai to Vancouver to Toronto; from\n\nthere, he took a boat to the New York border.               When asked for\n\nparticulars, he replied that he had traveled by speedboat for five\n\nor ten minutes and then by car for approximately six hours to reach\n\nNew York City's Chinatown district.             In his asylum interview,\n\nhowever, the petitioner recounted that he had traveled six hours by\n\nboat from Toronto to an island in the middle of a lake and, from\n\nthere, had traveled six more hours by boat to New York City.\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f            Third,     the    IJ    faulted    the    petitioner's    testimony\n\nregarding the medium of travel on the next leg of his sojourn.               The\n\npetitioner testified before the IJ that he had been driven in a\n\nsmall passenger car by a friend of his snakehead from New York to\n\nLos Angeles.      This was at odds with what he had told the asylum\n\nofficer: that he had traveled by truck between those two points.\n\n            Fourth, the IJ found that the petitioner's testimony as\n\nto how he had come into possession of various documents lacked\n\ncoherence (and, thus, lacked reliability).                  The IJ specifically\n\nmentioned   the   petitioner's       bank     book,   his   outpatient   medical\n\nrecords, and a police summons. The petitioner explained before the\n\nIJ that a mysterious individual named \"May\" — a California resident\n\nwhose gender is obscure and whom the petitioner could not identify\n\nfurther — had gone to China and brought back the bank book, medical\n\nrecords, and summons at his request.                  He had told the asylum\n\nofficer, however, that his mother had mailed those documents to\n\nhim.\n\n            Finally,    the    IJ    found     inherently     inconsistent   the\n\npetitioner's accounts of his alleged arrest in China.                Relatedly,\n\nshe noted that the petitioner had failed to offer any corroboration\n\nof the claim that he had been arrested.1              Although careful to note\n\n\n       1\n      The petitioner did submit two purported bail receipts in an\neffort to show that his mother had paid to get him and his father\nreleased from detention. But these documents were not properly\nauthenticated, see 8 C.F.R. § 287.6(b), and the IJ expressed grave\ndoubt about their provenance. In the circumstances of this case,\n\n                                       -5-\n\fthat corroborative evidence is not essential to the successful\n\nprosecution of an application for asylum, the IJ found this lack of\n\ncorroboration         particularly    detrimental       to     the   petitioner's\n\ncredibility and claim.\n\n              Having made an adverse credibility determination, the IJ\n\nproceeded to find that the petitioner had not established that his\n\napplication for asylum was timely.            She rejected the asylum claim\n\non that basis.         As alternative grounds for her decision, the IJ\n\nfound that, even assuming the truth of the petitioner's testimony,\n\n(i)   there     was    insufficient    evidence       demonstrating    that   any\n\npersecution on account of a protected ground had occurred and (ii)\n\nthat the petitioner had failed to show that he had an objectively\n\nreasonable fear of future persecution should he be returned to\n\nChina. In reaching these conclusions, the IJ relied heavily on the\n\nState Department's Country Report on Human Rights Practices in\n\nChina for 2003 (the 2003 Country Report).                    Pertinently, the IJ\n\nnoted that, while the petitioner had stated that he did not want to\n\nregister as a Christian with the Chinese government because of\n\nlikely    repercussions,     the     2003   Country    Report    indicated    that\n\nChristians returning to China should not be adversely affected by\n\ntheir religious preference.2\n\n\nthe IJ was entitled to give them little weight.\n      2\n      Indeed, the 2003 Country Report explained that, in many areas\nof China, home or family churches were tolerated as long as their\nmembership remained small and their activities discrete.\n\n                                       -6-\n\f               Consistent with these determinations, the IJ ordered\n\nremoval and denied the petitioner's cross-application for asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, or relief under the CAT. The BIA summarily\n\naffirmed.       This timely petition for judicial review followed.\n\n               Where, as here, the BIA has summarily affirmed an IJ's\n\ndecision, we review the IJ's decision \"as if it were the decision\n\nof the BIA.\"        Olujoke v. Gonzales, 411 F.3d 16, 21 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nIn this instance, the IJ found that the petitioner had not made an\n\nadequate showing of timeliness and, thus, was not eligible for\n\nasylum.       The petitioner seeks to revisit that determination here.\n\n               This effort is unavailing.            To qualify for asylum, an\n\nalien       ordinarily     must    \"demonstrate[]    by   clear   and   convincing\n\nevidence\" that his asylum application was filed within one year of\n\nhis arrival in the United States.                8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B).3       In\n\nthis case, the petitioner first filed for asylum on May 28, 2002.\n\nThus, he had to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he had\n\nfirst arrived in the United States no earlier than May 29, 2001.\n\nThe IJ held that the petitioner had failed in this endeavor.\n\n               We   are    bound    by    that   holding.   Congress     carefully\n\ncircumscribed        the    scope    of   judicial    review   with     respect   to\n\n\n        3\n      An asylum application filed beyond this one-year window may\nnonetheless be considered if the alien can show changed or\nextraordinary circumstances. 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(D). Because\nthe petitioner has not asserted the existence of changed or\nextraordinary circumstances sufficient to justify an untimely\nasylum application, we need not sculpt the contours of this\nexception.\n\n                                           -7-\n\ftimeliness determinations in asylum cases.            The relevant statute\n\nprovides that \"[n]o court shall have jurisdiction to review any\n\ndetermination of the Attorney General\" concerning, inter alia,\n\nwhether an asylum applicant has complied with the one-year filing\n\ndeadline.    Id. § 1158(a)(3).\n\n            This jurisdiction-stripping provision applies foursquare\n\nin the case at hand.     Citing a dearth of credible evidence, the IJ\n\nfound that it was at best \"unclear\" whether the petitioner had\n\nfiled a timely asylum application.         This was merely another way of\n\nsaying   that   the   petitioner    had    not   clearly   and   convincingly\n\ndemonstrated timeliness.     Because the IJ found as a matter of fact\n\nthat the petitioner had failed to prove timeliness and the BIA\n\nupheld   that    finding,   we     lack    jurisdiction     to   review   the\n\npetitioner's eligibility for asylum.         See id.; see also Sharari v.\n\nGonzales, 407 F.3d 467, 473 (1st Cir. 2005); Njenga v. Ashcroft,\n\n386 F.3d 335, 339 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n            The petitioner strives to avoid this jurisdictional bar\n\nby relying on another statute, which provides that \"[n]othing in .\n\n. . this chapter . . . which limits or eliminates judicial review,\n\nshall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or\n\nquestions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an\n\nappropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section.\"             8\n\nU.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D).      That reliance is misplaced.          To trigger\n\nour jurisdiction, the putative constitutional or legal challenge\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fmust be more than a disguised challenge to factual findings.                  The\n\nunderlying constitutional or legal question must be colorable; that\n\nis, the argument advanced must, at the very least, have some\n\npotential validity.       See Mehilli v. Gonzales, 433 F.3d 86, 93-94\n\n(1st Cir. 2005); Torres-Aguilar v. INS, 246 F.3d 1267, 1271 (9th\n\nCir. 2001). Here, the petitioner's claim of legal error is nothing\n\nmore than a thinly-veiled challenge to the IJ's factfinding and,\n\nthus, impuissant as a means of restoring our jurisdiction.                     We\n\nexplain briefly.\n\n            The petitioner's \"legal error\" claim is that the IJ\n\napplied    an    unduly   high   or   strict   standard    of    proof   to   the\n\ntimeliness determination.         See Petitioner's Br. at 6.        That claim\n\nis entirely conclusory; there is no sign that the IJ applied the\n\nwrong standard.\n\n            We add, moreover, that section 1158(a)(2)(B) requires\n\nthat an alien demonstrate \"by clear and convincing evidence\" that\n\nhis application for asylum was filed within the one-year window.\n\nIt follows that the burden of proof for satisfying the temporal\n\nelement of an asylum application is considerably \"higher\" or\n\n\"stricter\"      than   that   required   for   satisfying   the    substantive\n\nelements    of    an   asylum    application.4     Thus,    to    say    without\n\n\n     4\n      To make out the substantive elements of such a claim, an\nalien need only show a reasonable possibility that, if removed to\nhis homeland, he will be persecuted on account of a protected\nground.   See INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 440 (1987);\nAguilar-Solis v. INS, 168 F.3d 565, 572 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n                                       -9-\n\felaboration    (as   does   the   petitioner)   that     the   IJ   applied    an\n\nunusually high or strict standard of proof on timeliness amounts to\n\nnothing more than saying that the IJ honored the command of the\n\ncontrolling statute. Seen in this light, the petitioner's claim of\n\nlegal error is obviously incorrect and, thus, not colorable.\n\n          Of    course,     there   is   another   way    to    look   at     the\n\npetitioner's claim; he may be saying, on the bottom line, that the\n\nIJ simply got the facts wrong.       If this is so, the claim is no more\n\nthan a factual claim masquerading as a legal challenge.                 If the\n\ncynical use of that sort of costumery could defeat the operation of\n\nthe jurisdiction-stripping provision, then the provision would be\n\nrendered meaningless.       We refuse to go down so wayward a path.5\n\nAccord Arias v. U.S. Att'y Gen., 482 F.3d 1281, 1284 (11th Cir.\n\n2007); De Araujo v. Gonzales, 457 F.3d 146, 154 (1st Cir. 2006);\n\nMehilli, 433 F.3d at 94.\n\n          The short of it is that the petitioner has put forth no\n\ncolorable legal claim vis-à-vis the IJ's timeliness determination.\n\nConsequently, we lack jurisdiction to review the denial of the\n\npetitioner's asylum claim.        See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(3).\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      To the extent that the petitioner asserts that the record\nshows clearly and convincingly that he timely filed his asylum\napplication, that assertion is subject to the same infirmity. The\nassertion is a factual one: refined to bare essence, it asks us to\nconsider whether the IJ's contrary determination is supported by\nthe evidence.\n\n                                    -10-\n\f             This is not the end of the matter because there are no\n\nsimilar temporal or jurisdictional barriers to judicial review of\n\nthe denial of the petitioner's other claims for relief.                  We turn,\n\nthen, to his withholding of removal claim.\n\n             The    IJ   did    not    deal   specifically    with    this   claim.\n\nWithal,     the    asylum      and    withholding   of   removal     analyses    are\n\nsufficiently analogous that we may treat the IJ's findings of raw\n\nfact on the asylum claim as transferable in large part to the\n\nwithholding of removal claim.             Cf. Wine & Spirits Retailers, Inc.\n\nv. Rhode Island, 481 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2007) (acknowledging that\n\n\"a trial court's findings of fact, made in connection with one\n\nlegal theory, may often be treated as fungible in connection with\n\nanother\").\n\n              We review findings of fact in immigration proceedings\n\nonly   to    determine      whether      those   findings    are     supported   by\n\nsubstantial evidence in the record.              Bocova v. Gonzales, 412 F.3d\n\n257, 262 (1st Cir. 2005).                In other words, we accept an IJ's\n\nfindings of fact, including credibility determinations, as long as\n\nthey are \"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative\n\nevidence on the record considered as a whole.\"               Id. (quoting INS v.\n\nElias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992)).                   We will embrace a\n\nfinding unless the evidence \"points unerringly in the opposite\n\ndirection.\"       Laurent v. Ashcroft, 359 F.3d 59, 64 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nRulings of law engender de novo review, but with some deference to\n\n\n                                          -11-\n\fthe agency's reasonable interpretation of statutes and regulations\n\nthat fall within its purview.            See Bocova, 412 F.3d at 262; see\n\nalso Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Nat'l Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467\n\nU.S. 837, 843-44 (1984).\n\n           To qualify for withholding of removal, an alien must show\n\nthat, more likely than not, he faces persecution on account of one\n\nof five protected grounds, namely, race, religion, nationality,\n\nmembership in a particular social group, or political opinion,\n\nshould he return to his homeland.              See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42); 8\n\nC.F.R. § 208.16(b)(2); see also Da Silva v. Ashcroft, 394 F.3d 1,\n\n4 (1st Cir. 2005).       This \"more likely than not\" standard is harder\n\nfor an alien to satisfy than the \"reasonable possibility\" standard\n\nfor showing a well-founded fear of future persecution in asylum\n\ncases.   See INS v. Stevic, 467 U.S. 407, 429-30 (1984); Makhoul v.\n\nAshcroft, 387 F.3d 75, 82 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n           An     alien's     credible    testimony,   standing   alone,   may\n\nsustain his burden of proving eligibility for withholding of\n\nremoval.    See Settenda v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 89, 93 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).   But evidence that the factfinder supportably characterizes\n\nas   incredible    may   be    either    disregarded   or   discounted.    See\n\nLaurent, 359 F.3d at 64.            Accordingly, an adverse credibility\n\ndetermination can prove fatal to a claim for either asylum or\n\nwithholding of removal.         See, e.g., Stroni v. Gonzales, 454 F.3d\n\n\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\f82, 89 (1st Cir. 2006); Nikilujuw v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 115, 121\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).\n\n          This is such a case.                In itself, the IJ's adverse\n\ncredibility determination suffices to defeat the withholding of\n\nremoval claim.\n\n          Faced with that reality, the petitioner exhorts us to set\n\naside that determination.        He argues that an adverse credibility\n\ndetermination cannot rest on trivia but, rather, must rest on\n\ndiscrepancies that involve matters of consequence.                See Mewengkang\n\nv. Gonzales, ___ F.3d ___, ___ (1st Cir. 2007) [No. 06-1976, slip\n\nop. at 4-5]; Bojorques-Villanueva v. INS, 194 F.3d 14, 16 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).   The petitioner's premise is sound but the conclusion that\n\nhe seeks to have us draw from it does not follow.\n\n          We   have     outlined       the   anatomy   of   the    IJ's   adverse\n\ncredibility determination earlier in this opinion.                The IJ did not\n\ndeal in broad generalizations but relied on a specific and well-\n\narticulated    litany     of     identified       inconsistencies         in   the\n\npetitioner's     story.        Those     inconsistencies     involve      matters\n\nimportant to the petitioner's claims for relief, such as the\n\ncircumstances of his alleged detention, when he was last in China,\n\nand the date and manner of his arrival in the United States.                   The\n\npetitioner provided conflicting accounts of his journey to the\n\nUnited States; he failed to describe consistently the mode and\n\nmanner of his cross-country trip from New York to Los Angeles; and\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\fhe told different stories at different times about the origins of\n\nthe various documents that he introduced during the hearings. What\n\nis more, a letter from the petitioner's father undermined the\n\npetitioner's claim that his father had been hauled away to a labor\n\ncamp.\n\n               Some of these inconsistencies, in isolation, may seem\n\nlike    small    potatoes.            What   counts,    however,      is   that        their\n\ncumulative effect is great.              Cf. Bourjaily v. United States, 483\n\nU.S.    171,    179-80       (1987)    (acknowledging        that    the   \"sum    of     an\n\nevidentiary presentation may well be greater than its constituent\n\nparts\").\n\n               The     petitioner       also    notes       that    several       of     the\n\ninconsistencies mentioned by the IJ arise by comparison of the\n\npetitioner's statements at the hearings to his (quite different)\n\nstatements to the asylum officer.                   Before the IJ, the petitioner\n\nsought to minimize these discrepancies by claiming, in effect, that\n\nthe asylum officer got it wrong.               Any argument that the IJ erred in\n\nrejecting      that     claim    is    hopeless;      the   report    of   the     asylum\n\ninterview enjoys a presumption of regularity, and the IJ was\n\nentitled    to       treat   that     report   as    accurate.       See   Abdulai        v.\n\nAshcroft, 239 F.3d 542, 550 (3d Cir. 2001).\n\n               To continue in this vein would serve no useful purpose.\n\nWe conclude, without serious question, that the adverse credibility\n\ndetermination is supported by substantial evidence in the record.\n\n\n                                             -14-\n\f          The petitioner next suggests that other evidence in the\n\nrecord, not affected by the adverse credibility determination,\n\ncompels a conclusion that his fear of religious persecution is\n\nwell-founded.    That suggestion lacks merit.   The record, shorn of\n\nthe petitioner's testimony, cannot carry the weight that the\n\npetitioner seeks to load upon it.\n\n          The petitioner's main argument in this regard is that the\n\nIJ erred in failing to consider some documents and in misreading\n\nothers.   This argument is jejune.     Although an IJ may not simply\n\nignore substantial testimonial and documentary proof, she need not\n\ndiscuss ad nauseum every piece of evidence.          See Mihaylov v.\n\nAshcroft, 379 F.3d 15, 22 (1st Cir. 2004).      So long as the IJ has\n\ngiven reasoned consideration to the evidence as a whole, made\n\nsupportable findings, and adequately explained her reasoning, no\n\nmore is exigible.   See Martinez v. INS, 970 F.2d 973, 975 (1st Cir.\n\n1992).6\n\n          The petitioner also asseverates that the 2003 Country\n\nReport describes his native province as particularly intolerant of\n\nhome churches.    To the extent that it is true, this asseveration\n\n\n     6\n      The petitioner complains with especial acrimony about the\nIJ's reliance on an unfavorable passage contained in the 2003\nCountry Report.    In the petitioner's view, the IJ should have\nemphasized instead a more favorable passage.      In such matters,\nhowever, we defer to the factfinder's reasonable choices from\nconflicting evidence. See Martinez, 970 F.2d at 975; cf. United\nStates v. Ruiz, 905 F.2d 499, 508 (1st Cir. 1990) (stating that the\nfactfinder's choice among plausible but conflicting inferences\ncannot be clearly erroneous).\n\n                                -15-\n\fmisses the mark.      Withholding of removal is not in order when a\n\nrefugee may safely relocate within his native land.        See, e.g., Da\n\nSilva, 394 F.3d at 7; see also 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(b)(2).            There is\n\nno requirement that he be able to relocate to a particular province\n\nor village.\n\n             This leaves only the petitioner's claim under the CAT.\n\nThat claim need not detain us because the petitioner has made no\n\nreasoned argument to support it.          We long have held that legal\n\ntheories advanced in skeletal form, unaccompanied by some developed\n\nargumentation, are deemed abandoned. See, e.g., Jiang v. Gonzales,\n\n474 F.3d 25, 32 (1st Cir. 2007); United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d\n\n1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).     So it is here.\n\n             We summarize succinctly.     In the circumstances of this\n\ncase,   we   lack   jurisdiction   to   review   the   rejection    of   the\n\npetitioner's asylum claim.     The denial of the petitioner's claim\n\nfor withholding of removal is supported by substantial evidence in\n\nthe record.    Last — and in this instance least — the petitioner's\n\nCAT claim has been abandoned.      We need go no further.\n\n\n\nThe petition for judicial review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\f",

An Immigration Judge (IJ), finding that the petitioner's religious persecution claim lacked both credibility and substance, ordered his removal. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) summarily affirmed this case. The petitioner now seeks judicial review. We deny the petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When and how the petitioner arrived in the United States are hotly contested issues. It is clear, however, that he was here on May 28, 2002, when he initially applied for asylum. He alleged the following facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 20, 2001, four policemen forcibly entered a private residence in Changle, China, where the petitioner, his father, and other persons were participating in a peaceful Christian \"home church\" gathering. The officers questioned the petitioner with respect to his membership in the home church and its connection to a \"Taiwan anti[-]government group.\" Fourteen people, including the petitioner and his father, were detained at the local police station. There, the police interrogated the petitioner; angered by his responses one officer slapped his face, kicked him from his stool, and beat him with a baton. On the third of his eleven days in detention, the police handcuffed him to a pole behind the station house and forced him to stand overnight in the rain. His mother eventually posted bail to secure his release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner claims to have fled from China on August 26, 2001, with the assistance of a snakehead (a professional smuggler). He says that he left in the nick of time; shortly after his departure, Chinese authorities consigned both his father and the host of the home church to a labor camp. According to his account, he arrived in the United States on August 28, 2001, and entered illegally.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next material development occurred nine months later, when the petitioner self-reported to immigration authorities and sought asylum. On August 1, 2002, the former Immigration and Naturalization Service conducted an asylum interview. The interviewer (whom we shall refer to as the asylum officer) found that the petitioner was not credible, that both his chronology of events and his account of what had transpired were flawed, and that he had failed to show that his application for asylum was filed within one year of his arrival in the United States (as required by law). The asylum officer then referred the matter to the Immigration Court for the institution of removal proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner, who had traveled to the United States on a fraudulent passport, conceded removability. At the same time, he cross-applied for asylum, withholding of removal, or relief under the CAT. Following a series of evidentiary hearings, the IJ concluded that the petitioner had failed to carry the devoir of persuasion on any of his three claims for relief. The IJ's conclusion flowed in large measure from an adverse credibility determination. In that regard, the IJ zeroed in on a number of discrepancies in the petitioner's tale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, she noted that the petitioner had given conflicting accounts anent a taxi receipt introduced in the hope of showing his presence in China on August 26, 2001 (a date within the one-year eligibility period). Specifically, the petitioner testified before the IJ that he had carried the receipt out of China himself, whereas he had told the asylum officer that his mother had mailed the receipt to him from China some time after his arrival in the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the IJ found that the petitioner's testimony regarding the manner of his entry into and travel about the United States was wildly inconsistent. Before the IJ, the petitioner testified that he flew from Shanghai to Vancouver to Toronto; from there, he took a boat to the New York border. When asked for particulars, he replied that he had traveled by speedboat for five or ten minutes and then by car for approximately six hours to reach New York City's Chinatown district. In his asylum interview, however, the petitioner recounted that he had traveled six hours by boat from Toronto to an island in the middle of a lake and, from there, had traveled six more hours by boat to New York City.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the IJ faulted the petitioner's testimony regarding the medium of travel on the next leg of his sojourn. The petitioner testified before the IJ that he had been driven in a small passenger car by a friend of his snakehead from New York to Los Angeles. This was at odds with what he had told the asylum officer: that he had traveled by truck between those two points.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, the IJ found that the petitioner's testimony as to how he had come into possession of various documents lacked coherence (and, thus, lacked reliability). The IJ specifically mentioned the petitioner's bank book, his outpatient medical records, and a police summons. The petitioner explained before the IJ that a mysterious individual named \"May\" &#8212; a California resident whose gender is obscure and whom the petitioner could not identify further &#8212; had gone to China and brought back the bank book, medical records, and summons at his request. He had told the asylum officer, however, that his mother had mailed those documents to him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the IJ found inherently inconsistent the petitioner's accounts of his alleged arrest in China. Relatedly, she noted that the petitioner had failed to offer any corroboration of the claim that he had been arrested.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Although careful to note that corroborative evidence is not essential to the successful prosecution of an application for asylum, the IJ found this lack of corroboration particularly detrimental to the petitioner's credibility and claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having made an adverse credibility determination, the IJ proceeded to find that the petitioner had not established that his application for asylum was timely. She rejected the asylum claim on that basis. As alternative grounds for her decision, the IJ found that, even assuming the truth of the petitioner's testimony, (i) there was insufficient evidence demonstrating that any persecution on account of a protected ground had occurred and (ii) that the petitioner had failed to show that he had an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution should he be returned to China. In reaching these conclusions, the IJ relied heavily on the State Department's Country Report on Human Rights Practices in China for 2003 (the 2003 Country Report). Pertinently, the IJ noted that, while the petitioner had stated that he did not want to register as a Christian with the Chinese government because of likely repercussions, the 2003 Country Report indicated that Christians returning to China should not be adversely affected by their religious preference.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consistent with these determinations, the IJ ordered removal and denied the petitioner's cross-application for asylum, withholding of removal, or relief under the CAT. The BIA summarily affirmed. This timely petition for judicial review followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where, as here, the BIA has summarily affirmed an IJ's decision, we review the IJ's decision \"as if it were the decision of the BIA.\" <i>Olujoke v. Gonzales,</i> 411 F.3d 16, 21 (1st Cir.2005). In this instance, the IJ found that the petitioner had not made an adequate showing of timeliness and, thus, was not eligible for asylum. The petitioner seeks to revisit that determination here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This effort is unavailing. To qualify for asylum, an alien ordinarily must \"demonstrate[] by clear and convincing evidence\" that his asylum application was filed within one year of his arrival in the United States. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1158(a)(2)(B).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> In this case, the petitioner first filed for asylum on May 28, 2002. Thus, he had to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he had first arrived in the United States no earlier than May 29, 2001. The IJ held that the petitioner had failed in this endeavor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are bound by that holding. Congress carefully circumscribed the scope of judicial review with respect to timeliness determinations in asylum cases. The relevant statute provides that \"[n]o court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney General\" concerning, inter alia, whether an asylum applicant has complied with the one-year filing deadline. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1158(a)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This jurisdiction-stripping provision applies foursquare in the case at hand. Citing a dearth of credible evidence, the IJ found that it was at best \"unclear\" whether the petitioner had filed a timely asylum application. This was merely another way of saying that the petitioner had not clearly and convincingly demonstrated timeliness. Because the IJ found as a matter of fact that the petitioner had failed to prove timeliness and the BIA upheld that finding, we lack jurisdiction to review the petitioner's eligibility for asylum. <i>See id.; see also Sharari v. Gonzales,</i> 407 F.3d 467, 473 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Njenga v. Ashcroft,</i> 386 F.3d 335, 339 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner strives to avoid this jurisdictional bar by relying on another statute, which provides that \"[n]othing in ... this chapter ... which limits or eliminates judicial review, shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(2)(D). That reliance is misplaced. To trigger our jurisdiction, the putative constitutional or legal challenge must be more than a disguised challenge to factual findings. The underlying constitutional or legal question must be colorable; that is, the argument advanced must, at the very least, have some potential validity. <i>See Mehilli v. Gonzales,</i> 433 F.3d 86, 93-94 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Torres-Aguilar v. INS,</i> 246 F.3d 1267, 1271 (9th Cir.2001). Here, the petitioner's claim of legal error is nothing more than a thinly-veiled challenge to the IJ's factfinding and, thus, impuissant as a means of restoring our jurisdiction. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's \"legal error\" claim is that the IJ applied an unduly high or strict standard of proof to the timeliness determination. <i>See</i> Petitioner's Br. at 6. That claim is entirely conclusory; there is no sign that the IJ applied the wrong standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add, moreover, that section 1158(a)(2)(B) requires that an alien demonstrate \"by clear and convincing evidence\" that his application for asylum was filed within the one-year window. It follows that the burden of proof for satisfying the temporal element of an asylum application is considerably \"higher\" or \"stricter\" than that required for satisfying the substantive elements of an asylum application.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Thus, to say without elaboration (as does the petitioner) that the IJ applied an unusually high or strict standard of proof on timeliness amounts to nothing more than saying that the IJ honored the command of the controlling statute. Seen in this light, the petitioner's claim of legal error is obviously incorrect and, thus, not colorable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, there is another way to look at the petitioner's claim; he may be saying, on the bottom line, that the IJ simply got the facts wrong. If this is so, the claim is no more than a factual claim masquerading as a legal challenge. If the cynical use of that sort of costumery could defeat the operation of the jurisdiction-stripping provision, then the provision would be rendered meaningless. We refuse to go down so wayward a path.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>Accord Arias v. U.S. Att'y Gen.,</i> 482 F.3d 1281, 1284 (11th Cir.2007); <i>De Araujo v. Gonzales,</i> 457 F.3d 146, 154 (1st Cir.2006); <i>Mehilli,</i> 433 F.3d at 94.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of it is that the petitioner has put forth no colorable legal claim vis-&#224;-vis the IJ's timeliness determination. Consequently, we lack jurisdiction to review the denial of the petitioner's asylum claim. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1158(a)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not the end of the matter because there are no similar temporal or jurisdictional barriers to judicial review of the denial of the petitioner's other claims for relief. We turn, then, to his withholding of removal claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ did not deal specifically with this claim. Withal, the asylum and withholding of removal analyses are sufficiently analogous that we may treat the IJ's findings of raw fact on the asylum claim as transferable in large part to the withholding of removal claim. <i>Cf. Wine &amp; Spirits Retailers, Inc. v. Rhode Island,</i> 481 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.2007) (acknowledging that \"a trial court's findings of fact, made in connection with one legal theory, may often be treated as fungible in connection with another\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review findings of fact in immigration proceedings only to determine whether those findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record. <i>Bocova v. Gonzales,</i> 412 F.3d 257, 262 (1st Cir.2005). In other words, we accept an IJ's findings of fact, including credibility determinations, as long as they are \"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>INS v. Elias-Zacarias,</i> 502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)). We will embrace a finding unless the evidence \"points unerringly in the opposite direction.\" <i>Laurent v. Ashcroft,</i> 359 F.3d 59, 64 (1st Cir.2004). Rulings of law engender de novo review, but with some deference to the agency's reasonable interpretation of statutes and regulations that fall within its purview. <i>See Bocova,</i> 412 F.3d at 262; <i>see also Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc.,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 843-44, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To qualify for withholding of removal, an alien must show that, more likely than not, he faces persecution on account of one of five protected grounds, namely, race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion, should he return to his homeland. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(42); 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.16(b)(2); <i>see also Da Silva v. Ashcroft,</i> 394 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2005). This \"more likely than not\" standard is harder for an alien to satisfy than the \"reasonable possibility\" standard for showing a well-founded fear of future persecution in asylum cases. <i>See INS v. Stevic,</i> 467 U.S. 407, 429-30, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984); <i>Makhoul v. Ashcroft,</i> 387 F.3d 75, 82 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An alien's credible testimony, standing alone, may sustain his burden of proving eligibility for withholding of removal. <i>See Settenda v. Ashcroft,</i> 377 F.3d 89, 93 (1st Cir.2004). But evidence that the factfinder supportably characterizes as incredible may be either disregarded or discounted. <i>See Laurent,</i> 359 F.3d at 64. Accordingly, an adverse credibility determination can prove fatal to a claim for either asylum or withholding of removal. <i>See, e.g., Stroni v. Gonzales,</i> 454 F.3d 82, 89 (1st Cir.2006); <i>Nikijuluw v. Gonzales,</i> 427 F.3d 115, 121 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is such a case. In itself, the IJ's adverse credibility determination suffices to defeat the withholding of removal claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faced with that reality, the petitioner exhorts us to set aside that determination. He argues that an adverse credibility determination cannot rest on trivia but, rather, must rest on discrepancies that involve matters of consequence. <i>See Mewengkang v. Gonzales,</i> 486 F.3d 737, 740 (1st Cir. 2007); <i>Bojorques-Villanueva v. INS,</i> 194 F.3d 14, 16 (1st Cir.1999). The petitioner's premise is sound but the conclusion that he seeks to have us draw from it does not follow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have outlined the anatomy of the IJ's adverse credibility determination earlier in this opinion. The IJ did not deal in broad generalizations but relied on a specific and well-articulated litany of identified inconsistencies in the petitioner's story. Those inconsistencies involve matters important to the petitioner's claims for relief, such as the circumstances of his alleged detention, when he was last in China, and the date and manner of his arrival in the United States. The petitioner provided conflicting accounts of his journey to the United States; he failed to describe consistently the mode and manner of his cross-country trip from New York to Los Angeles; and he told different stories at different times about the origins of the various documents that he introduced during the hearings. What is more, a letter from the petitioner's father undermined the petitioner's claim that his father had been hauled away to a labor camp.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some of these inconsistencies, in isolation, may seem like small potatoes. What counts, however, is that their cumulative effect is great. <i>Cf. Bourjaily v. United States,</i> 483 U.S. 171, 179-80, 107 S.Ct. 2775, 97 L.Ed.2d 144 (1987) (acknowledging that the \"sum of an evidentiary presentation may well be greater than its constituent parts\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner also notes that several of the inconsistencies mentioned by the IJ arise by comparison of the petitioner's statements at the hearings to his (quite different) statements to the asylum officer. Before the IJ, the petitioner sought to minimize these discrepancies by claiming, in effect, that the asylum officer got it wrong. Any argument that the IJ erred in rejecting that claim is hopeless; the report of the asylum interview enjoys a presumption of regularity, and the IJ was entitled to treat that report as accurate. <i>See Abdulai</i> <i>v. Ashcroft,</i> 239 F.3d 542, 550 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To continue in this vein would serve no useful purpose. We conclude, without serious question, that the adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner next suggests that other evidence in the record, not affected by the adverse credibility determination, compels a conclusion that his fear of religious persecution is well-founded. That suggestion lacks merit. The record, shorn of the petitioner's testimony, cannot carry the weight that the petitioner seeks to load upon it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's main argument in this regard is that the IJ erred in failing to consider some documents and in misreading others. This argument is jejune. Although an IJ may not simply ignore substantial testimonial and documentary proof, she need not discuss ad nauseum every piece of evidence. <i>See Mihaylov v. Ashcroft,</i> 379 F.3d 15, 22 (1st Cir.2004). So long as the IJ has given reasoned consideration to the evidence as a whole, made supportable findings, and adequately explained her reasoning, no more is exigible. <i>See Martinez v. INS,</i> 970 F.2d 973, 975 (1st Cir.1992).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner also asseverates that the 2003 Country Report describes his native province as particularly intolerant of home churches. To the extent that it is true, this asseveration misses the mark. Withholding of removal is not in order when a refugee may safely relocate within his native land. <i>See, e.g., Da Silva,</i> 394 F.3d at 7; <i>see also</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.16(b)(2). There is no requirement that he be able to relocate to a particular province or village.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves only the petitioner's claim under the CAT. That claim need not detain us because the petitioner has made no reasoned argument to support it. We long have held that legal theories advanced in skeletal form, unaccompanied by some developed argumentation, are deemed abandoned. <i>See, e.g., Jiang v. Gonzales,</i> 474 F.3d 25, 32 (1st Cir.2007); <i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990). So it is here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We summarize succinctly. In the circumstances of this case, we lack jurisdiction to review the rejection of the petitioner's asylum claim. The denial of the petitioner's claim for withholding of removal is supported by substantial evidence in the record. Last &#8212; and in this instance least &#8212; the petitioner's CAT claim has been abandoned.

An Immigration Judge (IJ), finding that the petitioner's religious persecution claim lacked both credibility and substance, ordered his removal. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) summarily affirmed this case. The petitioner now seeks judicial review. We deny the petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When and how the petitioner arrived in the United States are hotly contested issues. It is clear, however, that he was here on May 28, 2002, when he initially applied for asylum. He alleged the following facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 20, 2001, four policemen forcibly entered a private residence in Changle, China, where the petitioner, his father, and other persons were participating in a peaceful Christian \"home church\" gathering. The officers questioned the petitioner with respect to his membership in the home church and its connection to a \"Taiwan anti[-]government group.\" Fourteen people, including the petitioner and his father, were detained at the local police station. There, the police interrogated the petitioner; angered by his responses one officer slapped his face, kicked him from his stool, and beat him with a baton. On the third of his eleven days in detention, the police handcuffed him to a pole behind the station house and forced him to stand overnight in the rain. His mother eventually posted bail to secure his release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner claims to have fled from China on August 26, 2001, with the assistance of a snakehead (a professional smuggler). He says that he left in the nick of time; shortly after his departure, Chinese authorities consigned both his father and the host of the home church to a labor camp. According to his account, he arrived in the United States on August 28, 2001, and entered illegally.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next material development occurred nine months later, when the petitioner self-reported to immigration authorities and sought asylum. On August 1, 2002, the former Immigration and Naturalization Service conducted an asylum interview. The interviewer (whom we shall refer to as the asylum officer) found that the petitioner was not credible, that both his chronology of events and his account of what had transpired were flawed, and that he had failed to show that his application for asylum was filed within one year of his arrival in the United States (as required by law). The asylum officer then referred the matter to the Immigration Court for the institution of removal proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner, who had traveled to the United States on a fraudulent passport, conceded removability. At the same time, he cross-applied for asylum, withholding of removal, or relief under the CAT. Following a series of evidentiary hearings, the IJ concluded that the petitioner had failed to carry the devoir of persuasion on any of his three claims for relief. The IJ's conclusion flowed in large measure from an adverse credibility determination. In that regard, the IJ zeroed in on a number of discrepancies in the petitioner's tale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, she noted that the petitioner had given conflicting accounts anent a taxi receipt introduced in the hope of showing his presence in China on August 26, 2001 (a date within the one-year eligibility period). Specifically, the petitioner testified before the IJ that he had carried the receipt out of China himself, whereas he had told the asylum officer that his mother had mailed the receipt to him from China some time after his arrival in the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the IJ found that the petitioner's testimony regarding the manner of his entry into and travel about the United States was wildly inconsistent. Before the IJ, the petitioner testified that he flew from Shanghai to Vancouver to Toronto; from there, he took a boat to the New York border. When asked for particulars, he replied that he had traveled by speedboat for five or ten minutes and then by car for approximately six hours to reach New York City's Chinatown district. In his asylum interview, however, the petitioner recounted that he had traveled six hours by boat from Toronto to an island in the middle of a lake and, from there, had traveled six more hours by boat to New York City.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the IJ faulted the petitioner's testimony regarding the medium of travel on the next leg of his sojourn. The petitioner testified before the IJ that he had been driven in a small passenger car by a friend of his snakehead from New York to Los Angeles. This was at odds with what he had told the asylum officer: that he had traveled by truck between those two points.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, the IJ found that the petitioner's testimony as to how he had come into possession of various documents lacked coherence (and, thus, lacked reliability). The IJ specifically mentioned the petitioner's bank book, his outpatient medical records, and a police summons. The petitioner explained before the IJ that a mysterious individual named \"May\" &#8212; a California resident whose gender is obscure and whom the petitioner could not identify further &#8212; had gone to China and brought back the bank book, medical records, and summons at his request. He had told the asylum officer, however, that his mother had mailed those documents to him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the IJ found inherently inconsistent the petitioner's accounts of his alleged arrest in China. Relatedly, she noted that the petitioner had failed to offer any corroboration of the claim that he had been arrested.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Although careful to note that corroborative evidence is not essential to the successful prosecution of an application for asylum, the IJ found this lack of corroboration particularly detrimental to the petitioner's credibility and claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having made an adverse credibility determination, the IJ proceeded to find that the petitioner had not established that his application for asylum was timely. She rejected the asylum claim on that basis. As alternative grounds for her decision, the IJ found that, even assuming the truth of the petitioner's testimony, (i) there was insufficient evidence demonstrating that any persecution on account of a protected ground had occurred and (ii) that the petitioner had failed to show that he had an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution should he be returned to China. In reaching these conclusions, the IJ relied heavily on the State Department's Country Report on Human Rights Practices in China for 2003 (the 2003 Country Report). Pertinently, the IJ noted that, while the petitioner had stated that he did not want to register as a Christian with the Chinese government because of likely repercussions, the 2003 Country Report indicated that Christians returning to China should not be adversely affected by their religious preference.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consistent with these determinations, the IJ ordered removal and denied the petitioner's cross-application for asylum, withholding of removal, or relief under the CAT. The BIA summarily affirmed. This timely petition for judicial review followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where, as here, the BIA has summarily affirmed an IJ's decision, we review the IJ's decision \"as if it were the decision of the BIA.\" <i>Olujoke v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></span>, 21 (1st Cir.2005). In this instance, the IJ found that the petitioner had not made an adequate showing of timeliness and, thus, was not eligible for asylum. The petitioner seeks to revisit that determination here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This effort is unavailing. To qualify for asylum, an alien ordinarily must \"demonstrate[] by clear and convincing evidence\" that his asylum application was filed within one year of his arrival in the United States. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1158(a)(2)(B).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> In this case, the petitioner first filed for asylum on May 28, 2002. Thus, he had to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he had first arrived in the United States no earlier than May 29, 2001. The IJ held that the petitioner had failed in this endeavor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are bound by that holding. Congress carefully circumscribed the scope of judicial review with respect to timeliness determinations in asylum cases. The relevant statute provides that \"[n]o court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney General\" concerning, inter alia, whether an asylum applicant has complied with the one-year filing deadline. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1158(a)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This jurisdiction-stripping provision applies foursquare in the case at hand. Citing a dearth of credible evidence, the IJ found that it was at best \"unclear\" whether the petitioner had filed a timely asylum application. This was merely another way of saying that the petitioner had not clearly and convincingly demonstrated timeliness. Because the IJ found as a matter of fact that the petitioner had failed to prove timeliness and the BIA upheld that finding, we lack jurisdiction to review the petitioner's eligibility for asylum. <i>See id.; see also Sharari v.

That reliance is misplaced. To trigger our jurisdiction, the putative constitutional or legal challenge must be more than a disguised challenge to factual findings. The underlying constitutional or legal question must be colorable; that is, the argument advanced must, at the very least, have some potential validity. <i>See Mehilli v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202037\"><a href=\"/opinion/202037/mehilli-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span>, 93-94 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Torres-Aguilar v.

Here, the petitioner's claim of legal error is nothing more than a thinly-veiled challenge to the IJ's factfinding and, thus, impuissant as a means of restoring our jurisdiction. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's \"legal error\" claim is that the IJ applied an unduly high or strict standard of proof to the timeliness determination. <i>See</i> Petitioner's Br. at 6. That claim is entirely conclusory; there is no sign that the IJ applied the wrong standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add, moreover, that section 1158(a)(2)(B) requires that an alien demonstrate \"by clear and convincing evidence\" that his application for asylum was filed within the one-year window. It follows that the burden of proof for satisfying the temporal element of an asylum application is considerably \"higher\" or \"stricter\" than that required for satisfying the substantive elements of an asylum application.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Thus, to say without elaboration (as does the petitioner) that the IJ applied an unusually high or strict standard of proof on timeliness amounts to nothing more than saying that the IJ honored the command of the controlling statute. Seen in this light, the petitioner's claim of legal error is obviously incorrect and, thus, not colorable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, there is another way to look at the petitioner's claim; he may be saying, on the bottom line, that the IJ simply got the facts wrong. If this is so, the claim is no more than a factual claim masquerading as a legal challenge. If the cynical use of that sort of costumery could defeat the operation of the jurisdiction-stripping provision, then the provision would be rendered meaningless. We refuse to go down so wayward a path.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>Accord Arias v. U.S. Att'y Gen.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"77615\"><a href=\"/opinion/77615/virgilio-jimenez-arias-v-us-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1281</span></a></span>, 1284 (11th Cir.2007); <i>De Araujo v.

Consequently, we lack jurisdiction to review the denial of the petitioner's asylum claim. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1158(a)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not the end of the matter because there are no similar temporal or jurisdictional barriers to judicial review of the denial of the petitioner's other claims for relief.

This \"more likely than not\" standard is harder for an alien to satisfy than the \"reasonable possibility\" standard for showing a well-founded fear of future persecution in asylum cases. <i>See INS v.

But evidence that the factfinder supportably characterizes as incredible may be either disregarded or discounted. <i>See Laurent,</i> 359 F.3d at 64. Accordingly, an adverse credibility determination can prove fatal to a claim for either asylum or withholding of removal. <i>See, e.g., Stroni v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202317\"><a href=\"/opinion/202317/stroni-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">82</span></a></span>, 89 (1st Cir.2006); <i>Nikijuluw v.

He argues that an adverse credibility determination cannot rest on trivia but, rather, must rest on discrepancies that involve matters of consequence. <i>See Mewengkang v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202828\"><a href=\"/opinion/202828/mewengkang-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">737</span></a></span>, 740 (1st Cir. 2007); <i>Bojorques-Villanueva v.

The petitioner's premise is sound but the conclusion that he seeks to have us draw from it does not follow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have outlined the anatomy of the IJ's adverse credibility determination earlier in this opinion. The IJ did not deal in broad generalizations but relied on a specific and well-articulated litany of identified inconsistencies in the petitioner's story. Those inconsistencies involve matters important to the petitioner's claims for relief, such as the circumstances of his alleged detention, when he was last in China, and the date and manner of his arrival in the United States. The petitioner provided conflicting accounts of his journey to the United States; he failed to describe consistently the mode and manner of his cross-country trip from New York to Los Angeles; and he told different stories at different times about the origins of the various documents that he introduced during the hearings. What is more, a letter from the petitioner's father undermined the petitioner's claim that his father had been hauled away to a labor camp.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some of these inconsistencies, in isolation, may seem like small potatoes. What counts, however, is that their cumulative effect is great. <i>Cf. Bourjaily v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111938\"><a href=\"/opinion/111938/bourjaily-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">171</span></a></span>, 179-80, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111938\"><a href=\"/opinion/111938/bourjaily-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2775</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111938\"><a href=\"/opinion/111938/bourjaily-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></a></span> (1987) (acknowledging that the \"sum of an evidentiary presentation may well be greater than its constituent parts\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner also notes that several of the inconsistencies mentioned by the IJ arise by comparison of the petitioner's statements at the hearings to his (quite different) statements to the asylum officer. Before the IJ, the petitioner sought to minimize these discrepancies by claiming, in effect, that the asylum officer got it wrong. Any argument that the IJ erred in rejecting that claim is hopeless; the report of the asylum interview enjoys a presumption of regularity, and the IJ was entitled to treat that report as accurate. <i>See Abdulai</i> <i>v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771995\"><a href=\"/opinion/771995/olufemi-yussef-abdulai-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general-of-the-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">239</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">542</span></a></span>, 550 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To continue in this vein would serve no useful purpose. We conclude, without serious question, that the adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner next suggests that other evidence in the record, not affected by the adverse credibility determination, compels a conclusion that his fear of religious persecution is well-founded. That suggestion lacks merit. The record, shorn of the petitioner's testimony, cannot carry the weight that the petitioner seeks to load upon it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's main argument in this regard is that the IJ erred in failing to consider some documents and in misreading others. This argument is jejune. Although an IJ may not simply ignore substantial testimonial and documentary proof, she need not discuss ad nauseum every piece of evidence. <i>See Mihaylov v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></span>, 22 (1st Cir.2004). So long as the IJ has given reasoned consideration to the evidence as a whole, made supportable findings, and adequately explained her reasoning, no more is exigible. <i>See Martinez v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587571\"><a href=\"/opinion/587571/javier-a-martinez-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">970</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">973</span></a></span>, 975 (1st Cir.1992).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner also asseverates that the 2003 Country Report describes his native province as particularly intolerant of home churches. To the extent that it is true, this asseveration misses the mark. Withholding of removal is not in order when a refugee may safely relocate within his native land. <i>See, e.g., Da Silva,</i> 394 F.3d at 7; <i>see also</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.16(b)(2). There is no requirement that he be able to relocate to a particular province or village.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves only the petitioner's claim under the CAT. That claim need not detain us because the petitioner has made no reasoned argument to support it. We long have held that legal theories advanced in skeletal form, unaccompanied by some developed argumentation, are deemed abandoned. <i>See, e.g., Jiang v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202605\"><a href=\"/opinion/202605/jiang-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 32 (1st Cir.2007); <i>United States v. Zannino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1990). So it is here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We summarize succinctly. In the circumstances of this case, we lack jurisdiction to review the rejection of the petitioner's asylum claim. The denial of the petitioner's claim for withholding of removal is supported by substantial evidence in the record. Last &#8212; and in this instance least &#8212; the petitioner's CAT claim has been abandoned. We need go no further.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>The petition for judicial review is denied.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The petitioner did submit two purported bail receipts in an effort to show that his mother had paid to get him and his father released from detention.
