Baldiga and Mirick, O'Connell, DeMallie & Lougee,\nLLP on brief for Universal Service Administrative Company, amicus\ncuriae.\n\n\n                          May 19, 2003\n\f           LYNCH, Circuit Judge.        This case involves competing\n\nclaims of the Springfield, Massachusetts public schools and the\n\ncreditors of LAN Tamers, Inc., a bankrupt company, to a million-\n\nplus dollars. The case arises from the intersection of the federal\n\nBankruptcy Code and the federal \"E-Rate\" program, created by the\n\nTelecommunications Act of 1996 to encourage public schools to\n\nconnect to the internet.      The E-Rate program subsidizes these\n\ninternet     connections   with     funds     extracted      from   the\n\ntelecommunications industry and administered by a private not-for-\n\nprofit corporation, the Universal Service Administrative Company\n\n(USAC).    The schools contract with service providers to do the\n\nconnection work.   USAC, through the Universal Service Fund (USF),\n\neither pays the subsidy to the service provider directly (if the\n\napproved schools have not already paid in full) or reimburses the\n\nschools for part of the cost (if the projects have been approved\n\nand the schools have paid the service provider for the work).        In\n\nthe latter case, USAC actually makes its payment to the service\n\nprovider, who in turn must pass the funds through to the school.\n\n           The issue here is whether reimbursement monies, presently\n\nheld by USAC, are part of the estate of LAN Tamers, the bankrupt\n\nservice    provider.   When   LAN   Tamers    filed   for   bankruptcy,\n\nSpringfield had already paid it in full for installation and\n\nmaintenance of internet networks at various schools.           USAC had\n\nalready approved E-Rate funding for the projects.         The bankruptcy\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fcourt and district court both held that these funds belong to\n\nSpringfield and are not the property of the estate.                We affirm.\n\n                                     I.\n\n            The facts about the structure of the E-Rate program and\n\nthe events are undisputed.\n\n            One of the goals of the 1996 Telecommunications Act was\n\nto   encourage   universal   telecommunications        service.       Universal\n\nservice    includes   \"advanced    telecommunications        and    information\n\nservices,\" particularly high-speed internet access, for schools (as\n\nwell as for libraries and rural health care providers).                  See 47\n\nU.S.C. § 254(b)(6), (h)(1) (2000).         The internet highway for these\n\nschools    is    paved    with    mandated        contributions      from    the\n\ntelecommunications industries; the USF's coffers are filled by\n\ninterstate telecommunications providers who pay mandatory charges,\n\nwhich they typically pass on to consumers in their bills.                See id.\n\n§ 254(d); 47 C.F.R. § 54.706 (2002). Federal regulations give USAC\n\nthe responsibility to administer the USF, collect the charges, and\n\ndisburse   its   funds,   all    under    the    direction   of    the   Federal\n\nCommunications Commission (FCC).          See 47 C.F.R. §§ 54.701, 54.702.\n\nThe USF monies are not appropriated federal funds; nonetheless,\n\nthey exist by reason of a federal mandate.               The funds are not\n\ndistributed by a federal agency but by USAC, a private nonprofit\n\ncorporation, subject to regulation.             See generally Tex. Office of\n\nPub. Util. Counsel v. FCC, 183 F.3d 393, 405-09 (5th Cir. 1999)\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f(describing USF provisions of 1996 Telecom Act and subsequent\n\nregulations); R.F. Frieden, Universal Service, 13 Harv. J.L. &\n\nTech. 395, 397-422 (2000) (same).\n\n             The E-Rate program implements the Telecom Act's mandate\n\nof USF support for schools.       See 47 U.S.C. § 254(b)(6).       In the\n\npast few years, USAC has disbursed between $1.4 billion and $1.7\n\nbillion annually in E-Rate funding for schools and libraries.          To\n\nreceive funds, a school enters directly into a contract with a\n\nservice provider to supply eligible telecommunications services.\n\nSee 47 C.F.R. § 54.504(c). The service provider must be registered\n\nwith USAC.    See USAC Service Provider Manual, ch. 4, available at\n\nhttp://www.sl.universalservice.org/vendor/manual/ (last visited\n\nMay 15, 2003).    A school must complete an application process with\n\nmultiple steps to have E-Rate support approved.            The amount of\n\nfunding a school receives from the USF depends on the area's\n\npoverty level, and ranges from 20% to 90% of the total cost of\n\neligible projects. See 47 C.F.R. § 54.505(b). Springfield, one of\n\nthe state's     most   economically    disadvantaged   school   districts,\n\ngenerally receives near the maximum percentage.\n\n             Most often, after approval, USAC and a school simply\n\ndisburse their respective shares of the cost directly to the\n\nservice provider. Sometimes, however, schools elect an alternative\n\npayment   method,      referred   to    as   \"Billed   Entity   Applicant\n\nReimbursement\" (BEAR), especially if they want a project completed\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fquickly.   Springfield chose the BEAR option for the two contracts\n\nat issue here.     Under the BEAR method, a school (the \"Billed Entity\n\nApplicant\") pays the full cost to a service provider up front,\n\nreceives from USAC a funding commitment letter for the E-Rate\n\nprogram's share of the cost, and then submits a form to USAC to\n\nreceive reimbursement.\n\n           USAC makes its payments from the USF in the form of\n\neither a check or, if the service provider so chooses and owes\n\ncharges to the USF, a credit against those charges.                     See 47 U.S.C.\n\n§ 254(h)(1)(B)(i)-(ii); 47 C.F.R. § 54.515.                     USAC says that it\n\nlacks the authority to pay a school directly, because the Telecom\n\nAct and its regulations allow payments from the USF only to service\n\nproviders.        See     47        U.S.C.   §     254(e)   (\"[O]nly    an    eligible\n\ntelecommunications carrier . . . shall be eligible to receive\n\nspecific Federal universal service support\"); id. § 254(h)(1)(B)\n\n(authorizing E-Rate payments for \"telecommunications carriers\").\n\nThus the service provider, who has already been paid, must receive\n\nthe funds under the BEAR method and pass them through to the\n\nschool.      As    part        of     the    BEAR    application,      an    authorized\n\nrepresentative of the service provider is required to sign an\n\n\"acknowledgment\" that:\n\n           [T]he service provider must remit the discount amount\n           authorized by [USAC] to the Billed Entity Applicant who\n           prepared and submitted this [form] as soon as possible\n           after [USAC]'s notification to the service provider of\n           the amount of the approved discounts . . . but in no\n\n\n                                             -6-\n\f          event later than 10 calendar days after the receipt of\n          the reimbursement payment . . . .\n\n          The service provider must remit payment of the approved\n          discount amount to the Billed Entity Applicant prior to\n          tendering or making use of the payment issued by [USAC]\n          to the service provider . . . .\n\nUSAC's handbook for service providers is even more explicit:                  \"The\n\nservice provider functions merely as a vehicle to deliver the\n\nreimbursement back to the applicant.                 Failure to provide the\n\nreimbursement   in    a   timely   fashion     may   result    in   the    Service\n\nProvider facing enforcement action.\" USAC Service Provider Manual,\n\nsupra,   ch.    9.1       Springfield      says      it   normally        received\n\nreimbursements within a few days after USAC paid them to the\n\nservice provider.\n\n          LAN    Tamers     completed      a    number    of    projects       for\n\nSpringfield, two of which are pertinent.             In 1999, LAN Tamers and\n\nSpringfield entered into a $1,096,180.28 contract for LAN Tamers to\n\ninstall a high-speed data network at Central High School. In 2001,\n\nthey entered into a separate one-year contract for LAN Tamers to\n\nprovide network maintenance services at four Springfield schools\n\nfor $134,220.     LAN Tamers completed both jobs satisfactorily.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n          We have found nothing further as to what \"enforcement\naction\" means, and whether it encompasses, for example, a\nprosecution for theft of the money. Cf. United States v. McKay,\n274 F.3d 755, 759 (2d Cir. 2001) (affirming conviction under 18\nU.S.C. § 641 (2000) for embezzling \"money . . . of the United\nStates\" where defendant improperly collected federally funded rent\nsubsidy from local housing authority).\n\n                                     -7-\n\fSpringfield paid in full for the Central High School project by\n\nJanuary 2000, and for the maintenance contract by January 2002.\n\n           USAC initially found the Central High School project\n\nineligible   for   E-Rate   funding,     but    Springfield   appealed   this\n\ndecision to the FCC and prevailed in March 2001.              By early 2002,\n\nthe contracts were fully performed by both parties and Springfield\n\nhad received funding commitment letters from USAC stating that the\n\nE-Rate program would reimburse 87% of each contract's cost.              These\n\ntwo reimbursements total $1,070,056.74.          Springfield submitted the\n\nrequired BEAR paperwork to USAC on April 17, 2002.             On each form,\n\nLAN Tamers signed the acknowledgment quoted above.\n\n           A month later, on May 20, 2002, LAN Tamers filed a\n\nvoluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition.            Upon learning of this\n\nfiling, USAC withheld payment of the reimbursements, which were to\n\nhave been made to LAN Tamers by check.           At proceedings brought by\n\ncreditors, LAN Tamers mentioned the reimbursements and said the\n\nmonies were not its property and that it acted merely as a pass-\n\nthrough.     The   creditors   claimed    the    proceeds.     The   City   of\n\nSpringfield appeared and asserted the reimbursements were its\n\nproperty. The bankruptcy court opined that Springfield's claim was\n\nreally a claim to title and to recover an asset and so it should be\n\n\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fasserted in an adversary proceeding.                  See Fed. R. Bankr. P.\n\n7001(2).2\n\n            On     June    4,    2002,    Springfield    filed    an   adversary\n\nproceeding laying claim to the reimbursements.              The suit named as\n\ndefendants LAN Tamers, its principal creditors, and USAC.                   One\n\ncreditor,    the    Bank    of   Western       Massachusetts,    counterclaimed,\n\narguing that its secured interest in all receivables of LAN Tamers\n\nextended to the reimbursements.            The Official Unsecured Creditors'\n\nCommittee also argued against Springfield's position and was deemed\n\na party to the proceeding.               LAN Tamers supported Springfield's\n\nclaim.      USAC also argued that the reimbursements belonged to\n\nSpringfield rather than LAN Tamers, but differed as to exactly what\n\npower the bankruptcy court had over USAC to order it to take\n\naction.     Presumably, with the blessing of the bankruptcy court's\n\ndetermination that the funds belong to Springfield, USAC intends to\n\nmake a check payable to LAN Tamers for the funds to be paid out to\n\nSpringfield.3 The bankruptcy court took testimony in the adversary\n\nproceeding on June 13, 2002, and heard post-trial oral argument on\n\n\n\n\n     2\n          No party disagrees that this is the appropriate vehicle\nto sort through the claim.\n     3\n          Springfield also asked the bankruptcy court to order USAC\nto remit the reimbursements within a certain time.       The court\nconcluded it had no jurisdiction to do so, City of Springfield v.\nLAN Tamers, Inc. (In re LAN Tamers, Inc.), 281 B.R. 782, 797-98\n(Bankr. D. Mass. 2002), and the issue is not before us. USAC has\nfiled an amicus brief in support of Springfield in this appeal.\n\n                                         -9-\n\fJune 26.    It also received pre-trial and post-trial briefing from\n\nthe parties.\n\n            The   bankruptcy   court   issued   a   comprehensive    written\n\ndecision in the adversary proceeding on August 16, 2002.             City of\n\nSpringfield v. LAN Tamers, Inc. (In re LAN Tamers, Inc.), 281 B.R.\n\n782 (Bankr. D. Mass. 2002).      It determined that the reimbursements\n\nwere not the property of the estate, but were held by LAN Tamers in\n\neither a resulting trust or a constructive trust for the benefit of\n\nSpringfield. Id. at 792, 796-97. The district court affirmed this\n\ndecision in a one-page order on September 26.\n\n            In October 2002, the bankruptcy court converted LAN\n\nTamers' petition from Chapter 11 to Chapter 7 and appointed David\n\nW. Ostrander as trustee of the bankruptcy estate.                The trustee\n\nreplaced the creditors' committee as the appellant before this\n\ncourt.     He appeals the exclusion of the reimbursements from the\n\nproperty of the estate.\n\n                                   II.\n\n            The only issue here, whether the reimbursements are the\n\nproperty of the estate, is purely one of law.               Normally, such\n\nissues are reviewed de novo.     See Lentz v. Spadoni (In re Spadoni),\n\n316 F.3d 56, 58 (1st Cir. 2003); Adams v. Coveney, 162 F.3d 23, 25\n\n(1st Cir.    1998).     Springfield    argues   for   a   more   deferential\n\nstandard, citing a case concerning a bankruptcy court's award of\n\nfees, Prebor v. Collins (In re I Don't Trust), 143 F.3d 1, 3 (1st\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fCir. 1998) (per curiam).               That case is inapposite, because it\n\ninvoked   discretionary          and    fact-based      judgments       made    by    the\n\nbankruptcy judge.         Id.; see Casco N. Bank, N.A. v. DN Assocs. (In\n\nre DN Assocs.), 3 F.3d 512, 515 (1st Cir. 1993).                    Here, there is\n\nplenary   review      of    an     unalloyed        legal   question.          We    have\n\njurisdiction       over    the   appeal       because   the    ruling    is    a     final\n\ndisposition of Springfield's adversary action.\n\n             Section 541 of the Bankruptcy Code defines the property\n\nof the estate.      See 11 U.S.C. § 541 (2000).             The statutory language\n\nevinces congressional intent to include a broad range of property.\n\nSee United States v. Whiting Pools, Inc., 462 U.S. 198, 204-05\n\n(1983).      It begins, in § 541(a), by including \"all legal or\n\nequitable interests of the debtor in property.\"                          11 U.S.C. §\n\n541(a)(1).     The remainder of § 541, however, enumerates statutory\n\nexclusions from this broad definition.                  Property covered by these\n\nprovisions    is    \"excluded\"         from   the    estate,    rather    than       being\n\n\"exempted\" under other portions of the Code.                   This is an important\n\ndistinction.       See Traina v. Sewell (In re Sewell), 180 F.3d 707,\n\n710   (5th     Cir.        1999)       (differentiating        \"exclusions\"          from\n\n\"exemptions\"); Ostrander v. Lalchandani (In re Lalchandani), 279\n\nB.R. 880, 882 n.3 (B.A.P. 1st Cir. 2002) (\"[P]roperty must first be\n\nproperty of the estate before it can be exempted.\").\n\n             Two exclusions are arguably relevant here.                        One such\n\nexclusion, § 541(c)(2), removes inalienable interests in trusts,\n\n\n                                          -11-\n\ftypically spendthrift trusts or pension plans, from the estate.\n\nThe bankruptcy court rested its holding on another basis for\n\nexclusion, which states:\n\n          Property in which the debtor holds, as of the\n          commencement of the case, only legal title and not an\n          equitable interest . . . becomes property of the estate\n          . . . only to the extent of the debtor's legal title to\n          such property, but not to the extent of any equitable\n          interest in such property that the debtor does not hold.\n\n11 U.S.C. § 541(d).\n\n          The trustee argues that the reimbursements are accounts\n\nreceivable of LAN Tamers, covered by the broad definition of the\n\nproperty of     the   estate,   and     that    Springfield    is    an   ordinary\n\nunsecured creditor of LAN Tamers, entitled only to a pro rata\n\ndistribution    for    its   claim    on     an    unpaid   contractual      debt.\n\nSpringfield, pointing to the bankruptcy court decision and the\n\nlanguage of the § 541(d) exclusion, responds that LAN Tamers never\n\nhad any equitable interest in the reimbursements and was simply a\n\nconduit for them.     There is no claim that Springfield did not meet\n\nall the requirements to get the funding; USAC, in whose coffers the\n\nfunds now reside, argues that the money should go to Springfield.\n\nCf. Buchanan v. Alexander, 45 U.S. (4 How.) 20 (1846) (navy purser\n\nargues that seamen's wages cannot be attached by their creditors).\n\n          The plain text of § 541(d) excludes property from the\n\nestate where the bankrupt entity is only a delivery vehicle and\n\nlacks   any    equitable     interest      in     the   property    it    delivers.\n\nIdentical language found in both the House and Senate reports that\n\n                                      -12-\n\faccompanied passage of the Bankruptcy Code strongly reinforces this\n\nplain reading.    See United States v. Yellin (In re Weinstein), 272\n\nF.3d 39, 43, 45-46 (1st Cir. 2001) (further supporting plain-text\n\ninterpretation of Bankruptcy Code through legislative history).\n\nWhile noting that the overall scope of § 541 is broad, the reports\n\ncontinue:\n\n            Situations occasionally arise where property ostensibly\n            belonging to the debtor will actually not be property of\n            the debtor, but will be held in trust for another. For\n            example, if the debtor has incurred medical bills that\n            were covered by insurance, and the insurance company had\n            sent payment of the bills to the debtor before the debtor\n            had   paid  the   bill   for   which  the   payment   was\n            reimbursement, the payment would actually be held in a\n            constructive trust for the person to whom the bill was\n            owed.\n\nS. Rep. No. 95-989 (1978), at 82, reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N.\n\n5787, 5868; H.R. Rep. No. 95-595 (1978), at 368, reprinted in 1978\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 5963, 6324.      In this congressional hypothetical,\n\nproperty is excluded from the estate where the debtor merely\n\nreceives property in order to deliver it to its intended recipient\n\nwithout any control or ownership over it.\n\n            The task, then, is to characterize the reimbursements\n\nproperly. To determine the nature of LAN Tamers' interest, we look\n\nto the nature of the federal program from which that interest\n\narises.   At least two circuits have faced analogous problems under\n\n§ 541(d).    In one of these cases, the Seventh Circuit aptly framed\n\nthe issue:\n\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\f            The answer depends on the terms under which the grants\n            were made. Did they constitute [the debtor] a trustee,\n            custodian, or other intermediary, who lacks beneficial\n            title and is merely an agent for the disbursal of funds\n            belonging to another? If so, the funds . . . were not\n            assets of the bankruptcy estate. Or were the grants more\n            like payment under a contract . . . ?\n\nIn re Joliet-Will County Cmty. Action Agency, 847 F.2d 430, 432\n\n(7th Cir. 1988) (Posner, J.) (citations omitted).                    Joliet-Will\n\ninvolved efforts by a federal agency to claim the unexpended\n\nbalance of federal grant funds and property bought with grant funds\n\nfrom the estate of a bankrupt private nonprofit community service\n\nagency, and thus to prevent distribution of this property to\n\ncreditors.        The   court   looked    at    the   nature   of   the   federal\n\ngovernment's      interest   in   the    property,    expressed      through   the\n\nregulations and the nature of the grantor-grantee relationship.\n\nId. at 432. Joliet-Will expressly noted that this federal interest\n\ndoes not preempt the Code -- a recipient of federal money can\n\ndeclare bankruptcy -- but it may affect the issue of who owns the\n\nproperty.    Id. at 433.\n\n            The    Third   Circuit,      in    deciding   In   re   Columbia   Gas\n\nSystems, Inc., 997 F.2d 1039 (3d Cir. 1993), held that refunds\n\ncreated and mandated pursuant to federal law by a federal agency,\n\nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and held by a\n\nbankrupt natural gas pipeline company, were not the property of the\n\nestate under § 541(d).          Id. at 1061 (debtor \"acts as a receiving\n\nand transmitting agent, or a conduit, for money upstream suppliers\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\fowe to overcharged consumers\") (quotation omitted). As such, the\n\nfunds could not be reached by creditors of the bankrupt entity.\n\nAnalyzing the problem as one of federal law, Columbia Gas held that\n\nthe bankruptcy court should give permission to the debtor to pay\n\nrefunds that it had collected from upstream suppliers to the\n\nappropriate customers.   Id. at 1064.   Using trust and beneficiary\n\nconcepts as a matter of federal common law, the court considered\n\nthe facts that the refunds were created by order of a federal\n\nagency, private parties could not alter the refund orders, the\n\nrefunds implemented a central objective of the federal legislation,\n\nand the refunds should not be subject to the inconsistent results\n\nthat the vagaries of state law would impose.         Id. at 1055.\n\nColumbia Gas likewise excluded surcharges the debtor had collected\n\nfrom customers to fund industry research under FERC's direction.\n\nId. at 1062; see also Westmoreland Human Opportunities, Inc. v.\n\nWalsh, 246 F.3d 233, 243-46 (3d Cir. 2001) (rights to debtor\n\ngrantee's continuing contract relationship with government are not\n\nproperty of the estate); In re United Milk Prods. Co., 261 F. Supp.\n\n766 (N.D. Ill. 1966) (funds collected by debtor under federal milk\n\nmarketing orders, and owed to milk producers, are not property of\n\nthe estate in pre-Code case); cf. Yonkers Bd. of Educ. v. Richmond\n\nChildren's Ctr., 58 B.R. 980, 981-82 (S.D.N.Y. 1986) (funds from\n\nstate education department paid to debtor but designated as \"pass-\n\n\n\n\n                               -15-\n\fthrough\" payment for school district are not property of the\n\nestate).\n\n            These cases share several common modes of analysis which\n\nwe apply here.     First, we look to the role that the debtor was\n\nintended to play.     In the words of USAC's guidance to service\n\nproviders, LAN Tamers \"function[ed] merely as a vehicle to deliver\n\nthe reimbursement back to the applicant.\"    Courts have classified\n\ndebtors as mere delivery vehicles even when the nature of the\n\n\"pass-through\" under a government program is less obvious than it\n\nis here.4   See Joliet-Will, 847 F.2d at 432; Connecticut v. Novak\n\n(In re Cmty. Assocs., Inc.), 173 B.R. 824, 830 (D. Conn. 1994)\n\n(vans purchased with state-administered federal grant for transport\n\nof elderly and disabled are not property of the estate).    Joliet-\n\nWill emphasized that the terms of the grant rendered the grantee\n\n\"in effect an agent to carry out specified tasks rather than a\n\n\n     4\n          Some courts have excluded property from the estate on the\nbasis that the debtor was a mere delivery vehicle without any\ngovernment interest directly at stake. See, e.g., T & B Scottdale\nContractors, Inc. v. United States, 866 F.2d 1372, 1376 (11th Cir.\n1989) (bank account maintained by primary contractor contained\nfunds from subcontractor to pay its materialmen; funds not part of\nsubcontractor's bankruptcy estate because held solely for benefit\nof materialmen); Branch v. Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopolous,\nInc. (In re Bank of New Engl. Corp.), 165 B.R. 972, 978 (Bankr. D.\nMass. 1994) (debtor transmitted payments from its subsidiaries to\nan advertising agency; this was \"straight pass-through\" with \"no\nprofit element\" for debtor and therefore not property of its\nestate); Shipley Co. v. Darr (In re Tap, Inc.), 52 B.R. 271, 276\n(Bankr. D. Mass. 1985) (debtor payroll company's \"only function was\nto transmit the funds entrusted to it promptly\" so that funds are\nnot property of its estate).      We need not consider such non-\ngovernmental situations in this appeal.\n\n                                -16-\n\fborrower, or an entrepreneur using invested funds.\"            847 F.2d at\n\n432.   The restrictive rules and intensive oversight rendered the\n\ngrantee's ownership \"nominal.\"        Id.; see also Cmty. Assocs., 173\n\nB.R. at 828-29 (applying similar analysis to restrictive grant\n\nagreement). There is little doubt in this case that the regulatory\n\nstructure of the E-Rate program reduced LAN Tamers to the status of\n\na mere delivery vehicle.        LAN Tamers signed an acknowledgment\n\nstating as much and foregoing any beneficial interest in the funds.\n\nUSAC's guidance reiterates the point forcefully.\n\n            Second, we look to the degree and intensity of regulatory\n\ncontrol over the property in question.            See, e.g., Westmoreland,\n\n246 F.3d at 244-46 (looking to agency's \"pervasive and rigorous\"\n\nadministration of grant); Joliet-Will, 847 F.2d at 432 (noting that\n\nfederal agency placed \"minute controls on the use of the funds\" by\n\ndebtor grantee). As stringent as the supervision was in cases such\n\nas Joliet-Will, the debtor there enjoyed at least some autonomy in\n\nthe use of the property at issue.          Not so here.     Under the BEAR\n\npayment method, LAN Tamers has absolutely no freedom to do anything\n\nwith the reimbursements except forward them to Springfield within\n\nten days.     LAN Tamers was explicitly barred from \"tendering or\n\nmaking use    of\"   the   payment   from   USAC   before   Springfield   was\n\nreimbursed.    In addition, other aspects of the E-Rate program,\n\nincluding the registration of service providers and the multi-\n\n\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\flayered approval process for projects, display a comparable or\n\ngreater degree of regulatory control.\n\n          Next, we focus on the extent to which recognizing a\n\ngreater ownership interest -- and thereby diverting the property in\n\nquestion to the creditors -- would thwart the overall purpose of\n\nthe regulatory scheme.      See, e.g., Columbia Gas, 997 F.2d at 1055\n\n(\"[T]he refunds arise directly from federal law and implement the\n\ncentral objective of the [Natural Gas Act].\"); Yonkers, 58 B.R. at\n\n983 (purpose of reimbursement structure was to provide free public\n\neducation to mentally disabled children).           In part, the amount of\n\noversight is a proxy for this consideration. See Westmoreland, 246\n\nF.3d at 244.     But even without reference to the detailed BEAR\n\nprocedures, it is clear that Congress intended money from the USF\n\nto pay only for certain very specific activities.             See 47 U.S.C. §\n\n254(e)   (USF   funds    shall    be    used   \"only   for   the    provision,\n\nmaintenance, and upgrading of facilities and services for which the\n\nsupport is intended\").      LAN Tamers has already been paid for the\n\neligible services it provided; allowing USF funds to pay its other\n\ndebts would violate this congressional mandate.              See Buchanan, 45\n\nU.S. at 20-21 (\"The funds of the government are specifically\n\nappropriated    to      certain    national     objects,      and    if   such\n\nappropriations may be diverted and defeated by state process or\n\notherwise, the functions of the government may be suspended.\");\n\nJoliet-Will, 847 F.2d at 432 (\"Congress is traditionally chary\" of\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\fallowing funds of government programs to be diverted from their\n\nstated purposes).\n\n          Finally, we note that this conclusion also prevents the\n\ncreditors from receiving a windfall of double payment for the work\n\nLAN Tamers completed in Springfield's schools.    If LAN Tamers had\n\nnot filed for bankruptcy, it could hardly sue USAC in its own right\n\nto be paid again, having received full payment for its services\n\nfrom Springfield long before.    Once USAC issued the check to LAN\n\nTamers, the company could not have diverted the funds to its\n\ncreditors or to other purposes without \"facing enforcement action.\"\n\nAt most, LAN Tamers arguably would hold bare legal title to the\n\nreimbursements for a short time.5   It is a fundamental principle of\n\nbankruptcy law \"that the estate can only succeed to the same\n\nproperty interest that the debtor possesses, and cannot achieve a\n\ngreater interest.\"   5 L.P. King et al., Collier on Bankruptcy ¶\n\n541.01, at p. 541-8 (15th ed. 2003) (discussing § 541(d)).        A\n\nconclusion that the reimbursements should be distributed to the\n\ncreditors would flout this basic premise.       It would provide a\n\nwindfall to the creditors at the expense of Springfield's public\n\nschools and its students, contrary to the dictates of the statutory\n\nand regulatory text underlying the E-Rate program.\n\n\n     5\n          For purposes of this opinion, we need not consider\nwhether the bankruptcy court was correct in determining that LAN\nTamers did hold legal title to the reimbursements, despite the fact\nthat USAC has never sent the check. See LAN Tamers, 281 B.R. at\n792.\n\n                                -19-\n\f                                      III.\n\n            The trustee seeks to undermine this conclusion in a\n\nvariety of ways.     He advances different characterizations of many\n\nof the cases cited above, but the factual distinctions he makes are\n\nimmaterial to the legal conclusions we draw from the cases.\n\n            The trustee devotes most of his energy to supporting a\n\nvery narrow interpretation of § 541(d).         He argues that it applies\n\nsolely to trusts that would be recognized under state law, in this\n\ncase Massachusetts law.      He further argues that the conditions of\n\nMassachusetts trust law are not satisfied here.               We need not\n\ndetermine if the second contention is correct, because we reject\n\nthe first.    There is no basis for a per se rule limiting § 541(d)\n\nto state law trusts under all circumstances.\n\n            The Supreme Court unanimously rejected such a \"state law\n\nonly\" interpretation in Patterson v. Shumate, 504 U.S. 753 (1992).\n\nThat case concerned the exclusion in § 541(c)(2):           \"A restriction\n\non the transfer of a beneficial interest of the debtor in a trust\n\nthat   is    enforceable    under     applicable   nonbankruptcy    law    is\n\nenforceable in a case under [the Bankruptcy Code].\"          A beneficiary\n\nof a pension plan that was covered by the antialienation provision\n\nof the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), 29 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1056(d)(1) (1988), claimed that his interest in the plan was\n\nexcluded    from   his   bankruptcy    estate   because   ERISA   served   as\n\n\"applicable nonbankruptcy law\" restricting its transfer.                   The\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\fPatterson Court rejected an argument that the phrase applies only\n\nto state law, and not ERISA, finding that interpretation contrary\n\nto a \"natural reading of the provision.\" 504 U.S. at 758; see\n\nLalchandani, 279 B.R. at 885-86 (applying ERISA to § 541(c)(2) case\n\nconcerning dependents of beneficiaries).\n\n               The Court also noted that, when Congress intended for\n\nbankruptcy questions to be answered only by reference to state law,\n\nit so specified.         Patterson, 504 U.S. at 758 (citing examples).\n\nFor example, the Code explicitly incorporates applicable state law\n\nin defining certain exemptions.          See 11 U.S.C. § 522(b); Howe v.\n\nRichardson, 193 F.3d 60, 61 (1st Cir. 1999) (applying Rhode Island\n\nlaw to exemption under § 522(b)(2)(A)).              In the absence of any\n\nlanguage specifically incorporating state law in the exclusions,\n\nthe \"natural reading\" of § 541(d), like the Patterson Court's\n\nreading    of    §   541(c)(2),   cuts   against    the    trustee's   proposed\n\nconstruction that it incorporates and is restricted by state law in\n\nall situations.\n\n               It is true that state law often provides the applicable\n\nrules    for    bankruptcy   determinations    in    the    absence    of   other\n\nimperatives.         As the Supreme Court has summarized it, \"Property\n\ninterests are created and defined by state law.                   Unless some\n\nfederal interest requires a different result, there is no reason\n\nwhy such interests should be analyzed differently [in bankruptcy\n\nlaw].\"    Butner v. United States, 440 U.S. 48, 55 (1979) (emphasis\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\fadded); see Barnhill v. Johnson, 503 U.S. 393, 398 (1992) (citing\n\nButner).   Likewise, a recent bankruptcy decision in this court\n\nnoted that a federal court \"will often simply incorporate the law\n\nof the appropriate state if there is no relevant federal interest\n\nto justify a distinct federal rule.\"        United States v. Fleet Bank\n\nof Mass. (In re Calore Express Co.), 288 F.3d 22, 44 (1st Cir.\n\n2002) (emphasis added); see also Conn. Gen. Life Ins. Co. v.\n\nUniversal Ins. Co., 838 F.2d 612, 618 (1st Cir. 1988) (state law\n\n\"usually\" the determinant of property interests).                In short,\n\n\"Section   541   eliminates     exclusive   reliance   on   state   law   in\n\ndetermining what constitutes property of the estate but recognizes\n\nthe traditional role of the states in creating and defining the\n\nunderlying property interests and commercial arrangements to which\n\nbankruptcy law applies.\"         Branch v. Hill, Holliday, Connors,\n\nCosmopolous, Inc. (In re Bank of New Engl. Corp.), 165 B.R. 972,\n\n977 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1994) (quotation omitted).\n\n           The qualifying clauses in these decisions cannot be\n\nignored.   Where there are significant federal interests involved,\n\nthe   default    rule   of   applying   state   standards   to   bankruptcy\n\ndeterminations may yield.6        Here, the statutory and regulatory\n\nframework for the E-Rate program, established under the Telecom\n\nAct, provides a federal definition of the property interests\n\n\n      6\n          We need not decide precisely when state law would or\nwould not apply. We simply conclude that this situation involves\nsufficiently significant federal interests.\n\n                                    -22-\n\finvolved in this case.     That definition takes account of the\n\nfederal government's aspiration, expressed in the Telecom Act and\n\npromoted by the activities of the FCC and USAC, that \"[e]lementary\n\nand secondary schools and classrooms . . . should have access to\n\nadvanced telecommunications services.\"   47 U.S.C. § 254(b)(6).   As\n\nsuch, it is the definition that we apply.   See Calore Express, 288\n\nF.3d at 43-44 (choice of standard guided by protection of strong\n\nfederal interests).\n\n          Just as the language of § 541(d) does not invariably\n\nincorporate state law, it is not always limited to trusts either.\n\nTo be sure, since the separation of legal and equitable interests\n\nis characteristic of a trust, there will be overlap.     In some of\n\nthe cases discussed above, courts classified the excluded property\n\nas the corpus of a trust of some kind.      E.g., Columbia Gas, 997\n\nF.2d at 1059-60; Yonkers, 58 B.R. at 983.     The bankruptcy court\n\nhere did so as well.   LAN Tamers, 281 B.R. at 792.    And Congress\n\nreferred to a \"constructive trust\" in the insurance hypothetical\n\nquoted earlier.\n\n          This usage may prove confusing, however, because these\n\nsupposed trusts might lack characteristics of trusts recognized for\n\nother purposes under state law.   We think it better to avoid the\n\nlanguage of trusts and rest our holding more simply on the fact\n\nthat LAN Tamers, as a mere delivery vehicle, lacked an equitable\n\n\n\n\n                               -23-\n\finterest in the reimbursements under the federal program.7                      See\n\nR.J. Keach, The Continued Unsettled State of Constructive Trusts in\n\nBankruptcy,     103     Com.     L.J.     411,        446,    449    n.172   (1998)\n\n(distinguishing       \"true    conduit\"       cases    from   constructive    trust\n\ncases);   cf.     Joliet-Will,          847     F.2d     at    433    (criticizing\n\ncharacterization of government's interest in debtor's grant funds\n\nas \"equitable lien\" for similar reasons).\n\n             The trustee also argues that the Supreme Court's recent\n\ndecision in FCC v. NextWave Personal Communications, Inc., 123 S.\n\nCt. 832 (2003), requires a different outcome.                    In NextWave, the\n\ndebtor had purchased broadband spectrum licenses in an FCC auction,\n\nand arranged to pay for them in installments.                 When the debtor fell\n\nbehind in its payments and filed for bankruptcy, the FCC tried to\n\nrevoke the licenses, but the Court held that it could not.                      The\n\nlicenses remained property of the estate.\n\n             There are two enormous differences between NextWave and\n\nthis case.    First, FCC licenses have many qualities of property in\n\nwhich the licensee holds beneficial interest, sweeping them out of\n\nthe § 541(d) exclusion and into the broad overall definition of\n\nproperty of the estate.         See Ramsay v. Dowden, (In re Cent. Ark.\n\n\n\n     7\n          In addition, the use of constructive trusts as the basis\nfor exclusions under § 541 has been criticized for reasons\nunrelated to the situation of the true delivery vehicle.       See\ngenerally XL/Datacomp, Inc. v. Wilson (In re Omegas Group, Inc.),\n16 F.3d 1443 (6th Cir. 1994); E.L. Sherwin, Constructive Trusts in\nBankruptcy, 1989 U. Ill. L. Rev. 297.\n\n                                        -24-\n\fBroad. Co.), 68 F.3d 213, 214-15 (8th Cir. 1995) (per curiam).          The\n\nlicensee secures the right to engage in communications activities\n\nand keep the resulting profit for itself -- rather than serving\n\nsolely as a vehicle delivering benefits to another -- and does so\n\nunder less pervasive regulatory supervision. See Westmoreland, 246\n\nF.3d at 253-54 (distinguishing broadcast licenses from contract\n\nrights under a grant).\n\n          A second distinction between this case and NextWave is\n\nthat NextWave relied heavily on specific language in the Bankruptcy\n\nCode barring the government from revoking a license on the basis of\n\na debtor's nonpayment.    See 11 U.S.C. § 525(a).       The Court rejected\n\nthe FCC's argument that its regulatory authority trumped this\n\nprohibition.     NextWave, 123 S. Ct. at 838-40.             As such, it\n\ninvalidated the purported revocation as \"not in accordance with\n\nlaw\" under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)\n\n(2000).   See NextWave, 123 S. Ct. at 838.        Here, in contrast, the\n\ntrustee points to no similar provision of the Code that applies to\n\nthe reimbursements and stands in opposition to the federal rules\n\nderived from the E-Rate program's regulatory scheme.\n\n           Finally, throughout his briefs the trustee emphasizes the\n\nimportance in bankruptcy law of equal footing for similarly placed\n\ncreditors.     The argument assumes that Springfield is indeed a\n\ncreditor similar to the others.          This bankruptcy policy is not\n\nimplicated,    however,   when   the   property    in   question   is   not\n\n\n                                  -25-\n\flegitimately available to creditors in the first place. See Begier\n\nv. IRS, 496 U.S. 53, 58 (1990) (policy behind avoidance irrelevant\n\nwhen property is not part of the estate); United Milk, 261 F. Supp.\n\nat 768 (\"[U]nsecured creditors should not be permitted to share in\n\nmonies . . . which [the debtor] would not be permitted to retain\n\nfor its own use.\").   The true harm to creditors is minimal here\n\nanyway, because the legal and regulatory impediment to using the\n\nreimbursements for other purposes makes bare legal title to them an\n\nasset of almost no value.      See Westmoreland, 246 F.3d at 244\n\n(restrictions on housing grants so limit their transferability that\n\ngrantee's interest is \"essentially valueless\").   LAN Tamers served\n\nonly as a delivery vehicle for federally regulated reimbursements\n\nderived from the USF, not as an owner of those funds (or of the\n\nright to receive them).   The reimbursements were never part of the\n\nbankruptcy estate, so creditors never had a claim to them.\n\n                                IV.\n\n          For the reasons stated in this opinion, the ruling of the\n\ndistrict court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -26-\n\f",

The case arises from the intersection of the federal Bankruptcy Code and the federal \"E-Rate\" program, created by the Telecommunications Act of 1996 to encourage public schools to connect to the internet. The E-Rate program subsidizes these internet connections with funds extracted from the telecommunications industry and administered by a private not-for-profit corporation, the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC). The schools contract with service providers to do the connection work. USAC, through the Universal Service Fund (USF), either pays the subsidy to the service provider directly (if the approved schools have not already paid in full) or reimburses the schools for part of the cost (if the projects have been approved and the schools have paid the service provider for the work). In the latter case, USAC actually makes its payment to the service provider, who in turn must pass the funds through to the school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue here is whether reimbursement monies, presently held by USAC, are part of the estate of LAN Tamers, the bankrupt service provider. When LAN Tamers filed for bankruptcy, Springfield had already paid it in full for installation and maintenance of internet networks at various schools. USAC had already approved E-Rate funding for the projects. The bankruptcy court and district court both held that these funds belong to Springfield and are not the property of the estate. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts about the structure of the E-Rate program and the events are undisputed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of the goals of the 1996 Telecommunications Act was to encourage universal telecommunications service. Universal service includes \"advanced telecommunications and information services,\" particularly high-speed internet access, for schools (as well as for libraries and rural health care providers). <i>See</i> 47 U.S.C. &#167; 254(b)(6), (h)(1) (2000). The internet highway for these schools is paved with mandated contributions from the telecommunications industries; the USF's coffers are filled by interstate telecommunications providers who pay mandatory charges, which they typically pass on to consumers in their bills. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 254(d); 47 C.F.R. &#167; 54.706 (2002). Federal regulations give USAC the responsibility to administer the USF, collect the charges, and disburse its funds, all under the direction of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). <i>See</i> 47 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 54.701, 54.702. The USF monies are not appropriated federal funds; nonetheless, they exist by reason of a federal mandate. The funds are not distributed by a federal agency but by USAC, a private nonprofit corporation, subject to regulation. <i>See generally Tex. Office of Pub. Util. Counsel v. FCC,</i> 183 F.3d 393, 405-09 (5th Cir.1999) (describing USF provisions of 1996 Telecom Act and subsequent regulations); R.F. Frieden, <i>Universal Service,</i> 13 Harv. J.L. &amp; Tech. 395, 397-422 (2000) (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The E-Rate program implements the Telecom Act's mandate of USF support for schools. <i>See</i> 47 U.S.C. &#167; 254(b)(6). In the past few years, USAC has disbursed between $1.4 billion and $1.7 billion annually in E-Rate funding for schools and libraries. To receive funds, a school enters directly into a contract with a service provider to supply eligible telecommunications services. <i>See</i> 47 C.F.R. &#167; 54.504(c). The service provider must be registered with USAC. <i>See USAC Service Provider Manual,</i> ch. 4, <i>available at</i> http://www.sl.universalservice.org/vendor/manual/ (last visited May 15, 2003). A school must complete an application process with multiple steps to have E-Rate support approved. The amount of funding a school receives from the USF depends on the area's poverty level, and ranges from 20% to 90% of the total cost of eligible projects. <i>See</i> 47 C.F.R. &#167; 54.505(b). Springfield, one of the state's most economically disadvantaged school districts, generally receives near the maximum percentage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most often, after approval, USAC and a school simply disburse their respective shares of the cost directly to the service provider. Sometimes, however, schools elect an alternative payment method, referred to as \"Billed Entity Applicant Reimbursement\" (BEAR), especially if they want a project completed quickly. Springfield chose the BEAR option for the two contracts at issue here. Under the BEAR method, a school (the \"Billed Entity Applicant\") pays the full cost to a service provider up front, receives from USAC a funding commitment letter for the E-Rate program's share of the cost, and then submits a form to USAC to receive reimbursement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">USAC makes its payments from the USF in the form of either a check or, if the service provider so chooses and owes charges to the USF, a credit against those charges. <i>See</i> 47 U.S.C. &#167; 254(h)(1)(B)(i)-(ii); 47 C.F.R. &#167; 54.515. USAC says that it lacks the authority to pay a school directly, because the Telecom Act and its regulations allow payments from the USF only to service providers. <i>See</i> 47 U.S.C. &#167; 254(e) (\"[O]nly an eligible telecommunications carrier ... shall be eligible to receive specific Federal universal service support\"); <i>id.</i> &#167; 254(h)(1)(B) (authorizing E-Rate payments for \"telecommunications carriers\"). Thus the service provider, who has already been paid, must receive the funds under the BEAR method and pass them through to the school. As part of the BEAR application, an authorized representative of the service provider is required to sign an \"acknowledgment\" that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he service provider must remit the discount amount authorized by [USAC] to the Billed Entity Applicant who prepared and submitted this [form] as soon as possible after [USAC]'s notification to the service provider of the amount of the approved discounts ... but in no event later than 10 calendar days after the receipt of the reimbursement payment....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The service provider must remit payment of the approved discount amount to the Billed Entity Applicant prior to tendering or making use of the payment issued by [USAC] to the service provider....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">USAC's handbook for service providers is even more explicit: \"The service provider functions merely as a vehicle to deliver the reimbursement back to the applicant. Failure to provide the reimbursement in a timely fashion may result in the Service Provider facing enforcement action.\" <i>USAC Service Provider Manual, supra,</i> ch. 9.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Springfield says it normally received reimbursements within a few days after USAC paid them to the service provider.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LAN Tamers completed a number of projects for Springfield, two of which are pertinent. In 1999, LAN Tamers and Springfield entered into a $1,096,180.28 contract for LAN Tamers to install a high-speed data network at Central High School. In 2001, they entered into a separate one-year contract for LAN Tamers to provide network maintenance services at four Springfield schools for $134,220. LAN Tamers completed both jobs satisfactorily. Springfield paid in full for the Central High School project by January 2000, and for the maintenance contract by January 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">USAC initially found the Central High School project ineligible for E-Rate funding, but Springfield appealed this decision to the FCC and prevailed in March 2001. By early 2002, the contracts were fully performed by both parties and Springfield had received funding commitment letters from USAC stating that the E-Rate program would reimburse 87% of each contract's cost. These two reimbursements total $1,070,056.74. Springfield submitted the required BEAR paperwork to USAC on April 17, 2002. On each form, LAN Tamers signed the acknowledgment quoted above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A month later, on May 20, 2002, LAN Tamers filed a voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition. Upon learning of this filing, USAC withheld payment of the reimbursements, which were to have been made to LAN Tamers by check. At proceedings brought by creditors, LAN Tamers mentioned the reimbursements and said the monies were not its property and that it acted merely as a pass-through. The creditors claimed the proceeds. The City of Springfield appeared and asserted the reimbursements were its property. The bankruptcy court opined that Springfield's claim was really a claim to title and to recover an asset and so it should be asserted in an adversary proceeding. <i>See</i> Fed. R. Bankr.P. 7001(2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 4, 2002, Springfield filed an adversary proceeding laying claim to the reimbursements. The suit named as defendants LAN Tamers, its principal creditors, and USAC. One creditor, the Bank of Western Massachusetts, counterclaimed, arguing that its secured interest in all receivables of LAN Tamers extended to the reimbursements. The Official Unsecured Creditors' Committee also argued against Springfield's position and was deemed a party to the proceeding. LAN Tamers supported Springfield's claim. USAC also argued that the reimbursements belonged to Springfield rather than LAN Tamers, but differed as to exactly what power the bankruptcy court had over USAC to order it to take action. Presumably, with the blessing of the bankruptcy court's determination that the funds belong to Springfield, USAC intends to make a check payable to LAN Tamers for the funds to be paid out to Springfield.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The bankruptcy court took testimony in the adversary proceeding on June 13, 2002, and heard post-trial oral argument on June 26. It also received pre-trial and post-trial briefing from the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy court issued a comprehensive written decision in the adversary proceeding on August 16, 2002. <i>City of Springfield v. Lan Tamers, Inc. (In re Lan Tamers, Inc.),</i> 281 B.R. 782 (Bankr. D.Mass.2002). It determined that the reimbursements were not the property of the estate, but were held by LAN Tamers in either a resulting trust or a constructive trust for the benefit of Springfield. <i>Id.</i> at 792, 796-97. The district court affirmed this decision in a one-page order on September 26.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 2002, the bankruptcy court converted LAN Tamers' petition from Chapter 11 to Chapter 7 and appointed David W. Ostrander as trustee of the bankruptcy estate. The trustee replaced the creditors' committee as the appellant before this court. He appeals the exclusion of the reimbursements from the property of the estate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only issue here, whether the reimbursements are the property of the estate, is purely one of law. Normally, such issues are reviewed de novo. <i>See Lentz v. Spadoni (In re Spadoni),</i> 316 F.3d 56, 58 (1st Cir.2003); <i>Adams v. Coveney,</i> 162 F.3d 23, 25 (1st Cir.1998). Springfield argues for a more deferential standard, citing a case concerning a bankruptcy court's award of fees, <i>Prebor v. Collins (In re I Don't Trust),</i> 143 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1998) (per curiam). That case is inapposite, because it invoked discretionary and fact-based judgments made by the bankruptcy judge. <i>Id.; see Casco N. Bank, N.A. v. DN Assocs. (In re DN Assocs.</i>), 3 F.3d 512, 515 (1st Cir.1993). Here, there is plenary review of an unalloyed legal question. We have jurisdiction over the appeal because the ruling is a final disposition of Springfield's adversary action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 541 of the Bankruptcy Code defines the property of the estate. <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167; 541 (2000). The statutory language evinces congressional intent to include a broad range of property. <i>See United States v. Whiting Pools, Inc.,</i> 462 U.S. 198, 204-05, 103 S.Ct. 2309, 76 L.Ed.2d 515 (1983). It begins, in &#167; 541(a), by including \"all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property.\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 541(a)(1). The remainder of &#167; 541, however, enumerates statutory exclusions from this broad definition. Property covered by these provisions is \"excluded\" from the estate, rather than being \"exempted\" under other portions of the Code. This is an important distinction. <i>See Traina v. Sewell (In re Sewell),</i> 180 F.3d 707, 710 (5th Cir.1999) (differentiating \"exclusions\" from \"exemptions\"); <i>Ostrander v. Lalchandani (In re Lalchandani),</i> 279 B.R. 880, 882 n. 3 (B.A.P. 1st Cir.2002) (\"[P]roperty must first be property of the estate before it can be exempted.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two exclusions are arguably relevant here. One such exclusion, &#167; 541(c)(2), removes inalienable interests in trusts, typically spendthrift trusts or pension plans, from the estate. The bankruptcy court rested its holding on another basis for exclusion, which states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Property in which the debtor holds, as of the commencement of the case, only legal title and not an equitable interest... becomes property of the estate ... only to the extent of the debtor's legal title to such property, but not to the extent of any equitable interest in such property that the debtor does not hold.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">11 U.S.C. &#167; 541(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustee argues that the reimbursements are accounts receivable of LAN Tamers, covered by the broad definition of the property of the estate, and that Springfield is an ordinary unsecured creditor of LAN Tamers, entitled only to a pro rata distribution for its claim on an unpaid contractual debt. Springfield, pointing to the bankruptcy court decision and the language of the &#167; 541(d) exclusion, responds that LAN Tamers never had any equitable interest in the reimbursements and was simply a conduit for them. There is no claim that Springfield did not meet all the requirements to get the funding; USAC, in whose coffers the funds now reside, argues that the money should go to Springfield. <i>Cf. Buchanan v. Alexander,</i> 45 U.S. (4 How.) 20, 11 L.Ed. 857 (1846) (navy purser argues that seamen's wages cannot be attached by their creditors).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plain text of &#167; 541(d) excludes property from the estate where the bankrupt entity is only a delivery vehicle and lacks any equitable interest in the property it delivers. Identical language found in both the House and Senate reports that accompanied passage of the Bankruptcy Code strongly reinforces this plain reading. <i>See United States v. Yellin (In re Weinstein),</i> 272 F.3d 39, 43, 45-46 (1st Cir.2001) (further supporting plain-text interpretation of Bankruptcy Code through legislative history). While noting that the overall scope of &#167; 541 is broad, the reports continue:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Situations occasionally arise where property ostensibly belonging to the debtor will actually not be property of the debtor, but will be held in trust for another. For example, if the debtor has incurred medical bills that were covered by insurance, and the insurance company had sent payment of the bills to the debtor before the debtor had paid the bill for which the payment was reimbursement, the payment would actually be held in a constructive trust for the person to whom the bill was owed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">S.Rep.

In this congressional hypothetical, property is excluded from the estate where the debtor merely receives property in order to deliver it to its intended recipient without any control or ownership over it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The task, then, is to characterize the reimbursements properly. To determine the nature of LAN Tamers' interest, we look to the nature of the federal program from which that interest arises. At least two circuits have faced analogous problems under &#167; 541(d). In one of these cases, the Seventh Circuit aptly framed the issue:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The answer depends on the terms under which the grants were made. Did they constitute [the debtor] a trustee, custodian, or other intermediary, who lacks beneficial title and is merely an agent for the disbursal of funds belonging to another? If so, the funds ... were not assets of the bankruptcy estate. Or were the grants more like payment under a contract ... ?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>In re Joliet-Will County Cmty. Action Agency,</i> 847 F.2d 430, 432 (7th Cir.1988) (Posner, J.) (citations omitted). <i>Joliet-Will</i> involved efforts by a federal agency to claim the unexpended balance of federal grant funds and property bought with grant funds from the estate of a bankrupt private nonprofit community service agency, and thus to prevent distribution of this property to creditors. The court looked at the nature of the federal government's interest in the property, expressed through the regulations and the nature of the grantor-grantee relationship. <i>Id.</i> at 432. <i>Joliet-Will</i> expressly noted that this federal interest does not preempt the Code &#8212; a recipient of federal money can declare bankruptcy &#8212; but it may affect the issue of who owns the property. <i>Id.</i> at 433.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Third Circuit, in deciding <i>In re Columbia Gas Systems, Inc.,</i> 997 F.2d 1039 (3d Cir.1993), held that refunds created and mandated pursuant to federal law by a federal agency, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and held by a bankrupt natural gas pipeline company, were not the property of the estate under &#167; 541(d). <i>Id.</i> at 1061 (debtor \"acts as a receiving and transmitting agent, or a conduit, for money upstream suppliers owe to overcharged consumers\") (quotation omitted). As such, the funds could not be reached by creditors of the bankrupt entity. Analyzing the problem as one of federal law, <i>Columbia Gas</i> held that the bankruptcy court should give permission to the debtor to pay refunds that it had collected from upstream suppliers to the appropriate customers. <i>Id.</i> at 1064. Using trust and beneficiary concepts as a matter of federal common law, the court considered the facts that the refunds were created by order of a federal agency, private parties could not alter the refund orders, the refunds implemented a central objective of the federal legislation, and the refunds should not be subject to the inconsistent results that the vagaries of state law would impose. <i>Id.</i> at 1055. <i>Columbia Gas</i> likewise excluded surcharges the debtor had collected from customers to fund industry research under FERC's direction. <i>Id.</i> at 1062; <i>see also Westmoreland Human Opportunities, Inc. v. Walsh,</i> 246 F.3d 233, 243-46 (3d Cir.2001) (rights to debtor grantee's continuing contract relationship with government are not property of the estate); <i>In re United Milk Prods.

First, we look to the role that the debtor was intended to play. In the words of USAC's guidance to service providers, LAN Tamers \"function[ed] merely as a vehicle to deliver the reimbursement back to the applicant.\" Courts have classified debtors as mere delivery vehicles even when the nature of the \"pass-through\" under a government program is less obvious than it is here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See Joliet-Will,</i> 847 F.2d at 432; <i>Connecticut v. Novak (In re Cmty. Assocs., Inc.),</i> 173 B.R. 824, 830 (D.Conn. 1994) (vans purchased with state-administered federal grant for transport of elderly and disabled are not property of the estate). <i>Joliet-Will</i> emphasized that the terms of the grant rendered the grantee \"in effect an agent to carry out specified tasks rather than a borrower, or an entrepreneur using invested funds.\" 847 F.2d at 432. The restrictive rules and intensive oversight rendered the grantee's ownership \"nominal.\" <i>Id.; see also Cmty. Assocs.,</i> 173 B.R. at 828-29 (applying similar analysis to restrictive grant agreement). There is little doubt in this case that the regulatory structure of the E-Rate program reduced LAN Tamers to the status of a mere delivery vehicle. LAN Tamers signed an acknowledgment stating as much and foregoing any beneficial interest in the funds. USAC's guidance reiterates the point forcefully.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, we look to the degree and intensity of regulatory control over the property in question. <i>See, e.g., Westmoreland,</i> 246 F.3d at 244-46 (looking to agency's \"pervasive and rigorous\" administration of grant); <i>Joliet-Will,</i> 847 F.2d at 432 (noting that federal agency placed \"minute controls on the use of the funds\" by debtor grantee). As stringent as the supervision was in cases such as <i>Joliet-Will,</i> the debtor there enjoyed at least some autonomy in the use of the property at issue. Not so here. Under the BEAR payment method, LAN Tamers has absolutely no freedom to do anything with the reimbursements except forward them to Springfield within ten days. LAN Tamers was explicitly barred from \"tendering or making use of\" the payment from USAC before Springfield was reimbursed. In addition, other aspects of the E-Rate program, including the registration of service providers and the multi-layered approval process for projects, display a comparable or greater degree of regulatory control.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, we focus on the extent to which recognizing a greater ownership interest &#8212; and thereby diverting the property in question to the creditors &#8212; would thwart the overall purpose of the regulatory scheme. <i>See, e.g., Columbia Gas,</i> 997 F.2d at 1055 (\"[T]he refunds arise directly from federal law and implement the central objective of the [Natural Gas Act].\"); <i>Yonkers,</i> 58 B.R. at 983 (purpose of reimbursement structure was to provide free public education to mentally disabled children). In part, the amount of oversight is a proxy for this consideration. <i>See Westmoreland,</i> 246 F.3d at 244. But even without reference to the detailed BEAR procedures, it is clear that Congress intended money from the USF to pay only for certain very specific activities. <i>See</i> 47 U.S.C. &#167; 254(e) (USF funds shall be used \"only for the provision, maintenance, and upgrading of facilities and services for which the support is intended\"). LAN Tamers has already been paid for the eligible services it provided; allowing USF funds to pay its other debts would violate this congressional mandate. <i>See Buchanan,</i> 45 U.S.(4 How.) at 20-21 (\"The funds of the government are specifically appropriated to certain national objects, and if such appropriations may be diverted and defeated by state process or otherwise, the functions of the government may be suspended.\"); <i>Joliet-Will,</i> 847 F.2d at 432 (\"Congress is traditionally chary\" of allowing funds of government programs to be diverted from their stated purposes).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we note that this conclusion also prevents the creditors from receiving a windfall of double payment for the work LAN Tamers completed in Springfield's schools. If LAN Tamers had not filed for bankruptcy, it could hardly sue USAC in its own right to be paid again, having received full payment for its services from Springfield long before. Once USAC issued the check to LAN Tamers, the company could not have diverted the funds to its creditors or to other purposes without \"facing enforcement action.\" At most, LAN Tamers arguably would hold bare legal title to the reimbursements for a short time.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> It is a fundamental principle of bankruptcy law \"that the estate can only succeed to the same property interest that the debtor possesses, and cannot achieve a greater interest.\" 5 L.P. King et al., <i>Collier on Bankruptcy</i> &#182; 541.01, at p. 541-8 (15th ed.2003) (discussing &#167; 541(d)). A conclusion that the reimbursements should be distributed to the creditors would flout this basic premise. It would provide a windfall to the creditors at the expense of Springfield's public schools and its students, contrary to the dictates of the statutory and regulatory text underlying the E-Rate program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustee seeks to undermine this conclusion in a variety of ways. He advances different characterizations of many of the cases cited above, but the factual distinctions he makes are immaterial to the legal conclusions we draw from the cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustee devotes most of his energy to supporting a very narrow interpretation of &#167; 541(d). He argues that it applies solely to trusts that would be recognized under state law, in this case Massachusetts law. He further argues that the conditions of Massachusetts trust law are not satisfied here. We need not determine if the second contention is correct, because we reject the first. There is no basis for a per se rule limiting &#167; 541(d) to state law trusts under all circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court unanimously rejected such a \"state law only\" interpretation in <i>Patterson v. Shumate,</i> 504 U.S. 753, 112 S.Ct. 2242, 119 L.Ed.2d 519 (1992). That case concerned the exclusion in &#167; 541(c)(2): \"A restriction on the transfer of a beneficial interest of the debtor in a trust that is enforceable under applicable nonbankruptcy law is enforceable in a case under [the Bankruptcy Code].\" A beneficiary of a pension plan that was covered by the antialienation provision of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1056(d)(1) (1988), claimed that his interest in the plan was excluded from his bankruptcy estate because ERISA served as \"applicable nonbankruptcy law\" restricting its transfer. The <i>Patterson</i> Court rejected an argument that the phrase applies only to state law, and not ERISA, finding that interpretation contrary to a \"natural reading of the provision.\" 504 U.S. at 758, 112 S.Ct. 2242; <i>see Lalchandani,</i> 279 B.R. at 885-86 (applying ERISA to &#167; 541(c)(2) case concerning dependents of beneficiaries).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court also noted that, when Congress intended for bankruptcy questions to be answered only by reference to state law, it so specified. <i>Patterson,</i> 504 U.S. at 758, 112 S.Ct. 2242 (citing examples). For example, the Code explicitly incorporates applicable state law in defining certain <i>exemptions. See</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167; 522(b); <i>Howe v. Richardson,</i> 193 F.3d 60, 61 (1st Cir. 1999) (applying Rhode Island law to exemption under &#167; 522(b)(2)(A)). In the absence of any language specifically incorporating state law in the <i>exclusions,</i> the \"natural reading\" of &#167; 541(d), like the <i>Patterson</i> Court's reading of &#167; 541(c)(2), cuts against the trustee's proposed construction that it incorporates and is restricted by state law in all situations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that state law often provides the applicable rules for bankruptcy determinations in the absence of other imperatives. As the Supreme Court has summarized it, \"Property interests are created and defined by state law. <i>Unless some federal interest requires a different result,</i> there is no reason why such interests should be analyzed differently [in bankruptcy law].\" <i>Butner v. United States,</i> 440 U.S. 48, 55, 99 S.Ct. 914, 59 L.Ed.2d 136 (1979) (emphasis added); <i>see Barnhill v. Johnson,</i> 503 U.S. 393, 398, 112 S.Ct. 1386, 118 L.Ed.2d 39 (1992) (citing <i>Butner</i>). Likewise, a recent bankruptcy decision in this court noted that a federal court \"will often simply incorporate the law of the appropriate state <i>if there is no relevant federal interest</i> to justify a distinct federal rule.\" <i>United States v. Fleet Bank of Mass. (In re Calore Express Co.),</i> 288 F.3d 22, 44 (1st Cir.2002) (emphasis added); <i>see also Conn. Gen. Life Ins. Co. v. Universal Ins. Co.,</i> 838 F.2d 612, 618 (1st Cir.1988) (state law \"usually\" the determinant of property interests). In short, \"Section 541 eliminates exclusive reliance on state law in determining what constitutes property of the estate but recognizes the traditional role of the states in creating and defining the underlying property interests and commercial arrangements to which bankruptcy law applies.\" <i>Branch v. Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopoulos, Inc. (In re Bank of New Engl. Corp.),</i> 165 B.R. 972, 977 (Bankr.D.Mass.1994) (quotation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The qualifying clauses in these decisions cannot be ignored. Where there are significant federal interests involved, the default rule of applying state standards to bankruptcy determinations may yield.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Here, the statutory and regulatory framework for the E-Rate program, established under the Telecom Act, provides a federal definition of the property interests involved in this case. That definition takes account of the federal government's aspiration, expressed in the Telecom Act and promoted by the activities of the FCC and USAC, that \"[e]lementary and secondary schools and classrooms ... should have access to advanced telecommunications services.\" 47 U.S.C. &#167; 254(b)(6). As such, it is the definition that we apply. <i>See Calore Express,</i> 288 F.3d at 43-44 (choice of standard guided by protection of strong federal interests).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Just as the language of &#167; 541(d) does not invariably incorporate state law, it is not always limited to trusts either. To be sure, since the separation of legal and equitable interests is characteristic of a trust, there will be overlap. In some of the cases discussed above, courts classified the excluded property as the corpus of a trust of some kind. <i>E.g., Columbia Gas,</i> 997 F.2d at 1059-60; <i>Yonkers,</i> 58 B.R. at 983. The bankruptcy court here did so as well. <i>Lan Tamers,</i> 281 B.R. at 792. And Congress referred to a \"constructive trust\" in the insurance hypothetical quoted earlier.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This usage may prove confusing, however, because these supposed trusts might lack characteristics of trusts recognized for other purposes under state law. We think it better to avoid the language of trusts and rest our holding more simply on the fact that LAN Tamers, as a mere delivery vehicle, lacked an equitable interest in the reimbursements under the federal program.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> <i>See</i> R.J. Keach, <i>The Continued Unsettled State of Constructive Trusts in Bankruptcy,</i> 103 Com. L.J. 411, 446, 449 n. 172 (1998) (distinguishing \"true conduit\" cases from constructive trust cases); <i>cf. Joliet-Will,</i> 847 F.2d at 433 (criticizing characterization of government's interest in debtor's grant funds as \"equitable lien\" for similar reasons).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustee also argues that the Supreme Court's recent decision in <i>FCC v. NextWave Personal Communications, Inc.,</i> 537 U.S. 293, 123 S.Ct. 832, 154 L.Ed.2d 863 (2003), requires a different outcome. In <i>NextWave,</i> the debtor had purchased broadband spectrum licenses in an FCC auction, and arranged to pay for them in installments. When the debtor fell behind in its payments and filed for bankruptcy, the FCC tried to revoke the licenses, but the Court held that it could not. The licenses remained property of the estate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two enormous differences between <i>NextWave</i> and this case. First, FCC licenses have many qualities of property in which the licensee holds beneficial interest, sweeping them out of the &#167; 541(d) exclusion and into the broad overall definition of property of the estate. <i>See Ramsay v. Dowden, (In re Cent. Ark. Broad. Co.),</i> 68 F.3d 213, 214-15 (8th Cir.1995) (per curiam). The licensee secures the right to engage in communications activities and keep the resulting profit for itself &#8212; rather than serving solely as a vehicle delivering benefits to another &#8212; and does so under less pervasive regulatory supervision. <i>See Westmoreland,</i> 246 F.3d at 253-54 (distinguishing broadcast licenses from contract rights under a grant).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second distinction between this case and <i>NextWave</i> is that <i>NextWave</i> relied heavily on specific language in the Bankruptcy Code barring the government from revoking a license on the basis of a debtor's nonpayment. <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167; 525(a). The Court rejected the FCC's argument that its regulatory authority trumped this prohibition. <i>Nextwave,</i> 537 U.S. at ___ - ___, 123 S.Ct. at 838-40. As such, it invalidated the purported revocation as \"not in accordance with law\" under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. &#167; 706(2)(A) (2000). <i>See Nextwave,</i> 537 U.S. at ___, 123 S.Ct. at 838. Here, in contrast, the trustee points to no similar provision of the Code that applies to the reimbursements and stands in opposition to the federal rules derived from the E-Rate program's regulatory scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, throughout his briefs the trustee emphasizes the importance in bankruptcy law of equal footing for similarly placed creditors. The argument assumes that Springfield is indeed a creditor similar to the others. This bankruptcy policy is not implicated, however, when the property in question is not legitimately available to creditors in the first place. <i>See Begier v. IRS,</i> 496 U.S. 53, 58, 110 S.Ct. 2258, 110 L.Ed.2d 46 (1990) (policy behind avoidance irrelevant when property is not part of the estate); <i>United Milk,</i> 261 F.Supp. at 768 (\"[U]nsecured creditors should not be permitted to share in monies ... which [the debtor] would not be permitted to retain for its own use.\"). The true harm to creditors is minimal here anyway, because the legal and regulatory impediment to using the reimbursements for other purposes makes bare legal title to them an asset of almost no value. <i>See Westmoreland,</i> 246 F.3d at 244 (restrictions on housing grants so limit their transferability that grantee's interest is \"essentially valueless\"). LAN Tamers served only as a delivery vehicle for federally regulated reimbursements derived from the USF, not as an owner of those funds (or of the right to receive them). The reimbursements were never part of the bankruptcy estate, so creditors never had a claim to them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated in this opinion, the ruling of the district court is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We have found nothing further as to what \"enforcement action\" means, and whether it encompasses, for example, a prosecution for theft of the money<i>Cf.

The case arises from the intersection of the federal Bankruptcy Code and the federal \"E-Rate\" program, created by the Telecommunications Act of 1996 to encourage public schools to connect to the internet. The E-Rate program subsidizes these internet connections with funds extracted from the telecommunications industry and administered by a private not-for-profit corporation, the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC). The schools contract with service providers to do the connection work. USAC, through the Universal Service Fund (USF), either pays the subsidy to the service provider directly (if the approved schools have not already paid in full) or reimburses the schools for part of the cost (if the projects have been approved and the schools have paid the service provider for the work). In the latter case, USAC actually makes its payment to the service provider, who in turn must pass the funds through to the school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue here is whether reimbursement monies, presently held by USAC, are part of the estate of LAN Tamers, the bankrupt service provider. When LAN Tamers filed for bankruptcy, Springfield had already paid it in full for installation and maintenance of internet networks at various schools. USAC had already approved E-Rate funding for the projects. The bankruptcy court and district court both held that these funds belong to Springfield and are not the property of the estate. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts about the structure of the E-Rate program and the events are undisputed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of the goals of the 1996 Telecommunications Act was to encourage universal telecommunications service. Universal service includes \"advanced telecommunications and information services,\" particularly high-speed internet access, for schools (as well as for libraries and rural health care providers). <i>See</i> 47 U.S.C. &#167; 254(b)(6), (h)(1) (2000). The internet highway for these schools is paved with mandated contributions from the telecommunications industries; the USF's coffers are filled by interstate telecommunications providers who pay mandatory charges, which they typically pass on to consumers in their bills. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 254(d); 47 C.F.R. &#167; 54.706 (2002). Federal regulations give USAC the responsibility to administer the USF, collect the charges, and disburse its funds, all under the direction of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). <i>See</i> 47 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 54.701, 54.702. The USF monies are not appropriated federal funds; nonetheless, they exist by reason of a federal mandate.

In the past few years, USAC has disbursed between $1.4 billion and $1.7 billion annually in E-Rate funding for schools and libraries. To receive funds, a school enters directly into a contract with a service provider to supply eligible telecommunications services. <i>See</i> 47 C.F.R. &#167; 54.504(c). The service provider must be registered with USAC. <i>See USAC Service Provider Manual,</i> ch. 4, <i>available at</i> http://www.sl.universalservice.org/vendor/manual/ (last visited May 15, 2003). A school must complete an application process with multiple steps to have E-Rate support approved. The amount of funding a school receives from the USF depends on the area's poverty level, and ranges from 20% to 90% of the total cost of eligible projects. <i>See</i> 47 C.F.R. &#167; 54.505(b). Springfield, one of the state's most economically disadvantaged school districts, generally receives near the maximum percentage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most often, after approval, USAC and a school simply disburse their respective shares of the cost directly to the service provider. Sometimes, however, schools elect an alternative payment method, referred to as \"Billed Entity Applicant Reimbursement\" (BEAR), especially if they want a project completed quickly. Springfield chose the BEAR option for the two contracts at issue here. Under the BEAR method, a school (the \"Billed Entity Applicant\") pays the full cost to a service provider up front, receives from USAC a funding commitment letter for the E-Rate program's share of the cost, and then submits a form to USAC to receive reimbursement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">USAC makes its payments from the USF in the form of either a check or, if the service provider so chooses and owes charges to the USF, a credit against those charges. <i>See</i> 47 U.S.C. &#167; 254(h)(1)(B)(i)-(ii); 47 C.F.R. &#167; 54.515. USAC says that it lacks the authority to pay a school directly, because the Telecom Act and its regulations allow payments from the USF only to service providers. <i>See</i> 47 U.S.C. &#167; 254(e) (\"[O]nly an eligible telecommunications carrier ... shall be eligible to receive specific Federal universal service support\"); <i>id.</i> &#167; 254(h)(1)(B) (authorizing E-Rate payments for \"telecommunications carriers\"). Thus the service provider, who has already been paid, must receive the funds under the BEAR method and pass them through to the school. As part of the BEAR application, an authorized representative of the service provider is required to sign an \"acknowledgment\" that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he service provider must remit the discount amount authorized by [USAC] to the Billed Entity Applicant who prepared and submitted this [form] as soon as possible after [USAC]'s notification to the service provider of the amount of the approved discounts ... but in no event later than 10 calendar days after the receipt of the reimbursement payment....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The service provider must remit payment of the approved discount amount to the Billed Entity Applicant prior to tendering or making use of the payment issued by [USAC] to the service provider....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">USAC's handbook for service providers is even more explicit: \"The service provider functions merely as a vehicle to deliver the reimbursement back to the applicant. Failure to provide the reimbursement in a timely fashion may result in the Service Provider facing enforcement action.\" <i>USAC Service Provider Manual, supra,</i> ch. 9.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Springfield says it normally received reimbursements within a few days after USAC paid them to the service provider.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LAN Tamers completed a number of projects for Springfield, two of which are pertinent. In 1999, LAN Tamers and Springfield entered into a $1,096,180.28 contract for LAN Tamers to install a high-speed data network at Central High School. In 2001, they entered into a separate one-year contract for LAN Tamers to provide network maintenance services at four Springfield schools for $134,220. LAN Tamers completed both jobs satisfactorily. Springfield paid in full for the Central High School project by January 2000, and for the maintenance contract by January 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">USAC initially found the Central High School project ineligible for E-Rate funding, but Springfield appealed this decision to the FCC and prevailed in March 2001. By early 2002, the contracts were fully performed by both parties and Springfield had received funding commitment letters from USAC stating that the E-Rate program would reimburse 87% of each contract's cost. These two reimbursements total $1,070,056.74. Springfield submitted the required BEAR paperwork to USAC on April 17, 2002. On each form, LAN Tamers signed the acknowledgment quoted above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A month later, on May 20, 2002, LAN Tamers filed a voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition. Upon learning of this filing, USAC withheld payment of the reimbursements, which were to have been made to LAN Tamers by check. At proceedings brought by creditors, LAN Tamers mentioned the reimbursements and said the monies were not its property and that it acted merely as a pass-through. The creditors claimed the proceeds. The City of Springfield appeared and asserted the reimbursements were its property. The bankruptcy court opined that Springfield's claim was really a claim to title and to recover an asset and so it should be asserted in an adversary proceeding. <i>See</i> Fed. R. Bankr.P. 7001(2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 4, 2002, Springfield filed an adversary proceeding laying claim to the reimbursements. The suit named as defendants LAN Tamers, its principal creditors, and USAC. One creditor, the Bank of Western Massachusetts, counterclaimed, arguing that its secured interest in all receivables of LAN Tamers extended to the reimbursements. The Official Unsecured Creditors' Committee also argued against Springfield's position and was deemed a party to the proceeding. LAN Tamers supported Springfield's claim. USAC also argued that the reimbursements belonged to Springfield rather than LAN Tamers, but differed as to exactly what power the bankruptcy court had over USAC to order it to take action. Presumably, with the blessing of the bankruptcy court's determination that the funds belong to Springfield, USAC intends to make a check payable to LAN Tamers for the funds to be paid out to Springfield.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The bankruptcy court took testimony in the adversary proceeding on June 13, 2002, and heard post-trial oral argument on June 26. It also received pre-trial and post-trial briefing from the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy court issued a comprehensive written decision in the adversary proceeding on August 16, 2002. <i>City of Springfield v.

D.Mass.2002). It determined that the reimbursements were not the property of the estate, but were held by LAN Tamers in either a resulting trust or a constructive trust for the benefit of Springfield. <i>Id.</i> at 792, 796-97. The district court affirmed this decision in a one-page order on September 26.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 2002, the bankruptcy court converted LAN Tamers' petition from Chapter 11 to Chapter 7 and appointed David W.

The statutory language evinces congressional intent to include a broad range of property. <i>See United States v. Whiting Pools, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110958\"><a href=\"/opinion/110958/united-states-v-whiting-pools-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">198</span></a></span>, 204-05, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110958\"><a href=\"/opinion/110958/united-states-v-whiting-pools-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">515</span></a></span> (1983). It begins, in &#167; 541(a), by including \"all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property.\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 541(a)(1). The remainder of &#167; 541, however, enumerates statutory exclusions from this broad definition. Property covered by these provisions is \"excluded\" from the estate, rather than being \"exempted\" under other portions of the Code. This is an important distinction. <i>See Traina v. Sewell (In re Sewell),</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"18311\"><a href=\"/opinion/18311/in-re-martha-sewell/\"><span class=\"volume\">180</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">707</span></a></span>, 710 (5th Cir.1999) (differentiating \"exclusions\" from \"exemptions\"); <i>Ostrander v.

One such exclusion, &#167; 541(c)(2), removes inalienable interests in trusts, typically spendthrift trusts or pension plans, from the estate. The bankruptcy court rested its holding on another basis for exclusion, which states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Property in which the debtor holds, as of the commencement of the case, only legal title and not an equitable interest... becomes property of the estate ... only to the extent of the debtor's legal title to such property, but not to the extent of any equitable interest in such property that the debtor does not hold.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">11 U.S.C. &#167; 541(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustee argues that the reimbursements are accounts receivable of LAN Tamers, covered by the broad definition of the property of the estate, and that Springfield is an ordinary unsecured creditor of LAN Tamers, entitled only to a pro rata distribution for its claim on an unpaid contractual debt. Springfield, pointing to the bankruptcy court decision and the language of the &#167; 541(d) exclusion, responds that LAN Tamers never had any equitable interest in the reimbursements and was simply a conduit for them. There is no claim that Springfield did not meet all the requirements to get the funding; USAC, in whose coffers the funds now reside, argues that the money should go to Springfield. <i>Cf. Buchanan v. Alexander,</i> 45 U.S. (4 How.) 20, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L.

Identical language found in both the House and Senate reports that accompanied passage of the Bankruptcy Code strongly reinforces this plain reading. <i>See United States v. Yellin (In re Weinstein),</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199701\"><a href=\"/opinion/199701/paul-d-weinstein-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">272</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span>, 43, 45-46 (1st Cir.2001) (further supporting plain-text interpretation of Bankruptcy Code through legislative history). While noting that the overall scope of &#167; 541 is broad, the reports continue:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Situations occasionally arise where property ostensibly belonging to the debtor will actually not be property of the debtor, but will be held in trust for another. For example, if the debtor has incurred medical bills that were covered by insurance, and the insurance company had sent payment of the bills to the debtor before the debtor had paid the bill for which the payment was reimbursement, the payment would actually be held in a constructive trust for the person to whom the bill was owed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">S.Rep.

First, we look to the role that the debtor was intended to play. In the words of USAC's guidance to service providers, LAN Tamers \"function[ed] merely as a vehicle to deliver the reimbursement back to the applicant.\" Courts have classified debtors as mere delivery vehicles even when the nature of the \"pass-through\" under a government program is less obvious than it is here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See Joliet-Will,</i> 847 F.2d at 432; <i>Connecticut v. Novak (In re Cmty. Assocs., Inc.),</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1813974\"><a href=\"/opinion/1813974/in-re-community-associates-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">173</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">824</span></a></span>, 830 (D.Conn. 1994) (vans purchased with state-administered federal grant for transport of elderly and disabled are not property of the estate). <i>Joliet-Will</i> emphasized that the terms of the grant rendered the grantee \"in effect an agent to carry out specified tasks rather than a borrower, or an entrepreneur using invested funds.\" 847 F.2d at 432. The restrictive rules and intensive oversight rendered the grantee's ownership \"nominal.\" <i>Id.; see also Cmty. Assocs.,</i> 173 B.R. at 828-29 (applying similar analysis to restrictive grant agreement). There is little doubt in this case that the regulatory structure of the E-Rate program reduced LAN Tamers to the status of a mere delivery vehicle. LAN Tamers signed an acknowledgment stating as much and foregoing any beneficial interest in the funds. USAC's guidance reiterates the point forcefully.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, we look to the degree and intensity of regulatory control over the property in question. <i>See, e.g., Westmoreland,</i> 246 F.3d at 244-46 (looking to agency's \"pervasive and rigorous\" administration of grant); <i>Joliet-Will,</i> 847 F.2d at 432 (noting that federal agency placed \"minute controls on the use of the funds\" by debtor grantee). As stringent as the supervision was in cases such as <i>Joliet-Will,</i> the debtor there enjoyed at least some autonomy in the use of the property at issue. Not so here. Under the BEAR payment method, LAN Tamers has absolutely no freedom to do anything with the reimbursements except forward them to Springfield within ten days. LAN Tamers was explicitly barred from \"tendering or making use of\" the payment from USAC before Springfield was reimbursed. In addition, other aspects of the E-Rate program, including the registration of service providers and the multi-layered approval process for projects, display a comparable or greater degree of regulatory control.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, we focus on the extent to which recognizing a greater ownership interest &#8212; and thereby diverting the property in question to the creditors &#8212; would thwart the overall purpose of the regulatory scheme. <i>See, e.g., Columbia Gas,</i> 997 F.2d at 1055 (\"[T]he refunds arise directly from federal law and implement the central objective of the [Natural Gas Act].\"); <i>Yonkers,</i> 58 B.R. at 983 (purpose of reimbursement structure was to provide free public education to mentally disabled children). In part, the amount of oversight is a proxy for this consideration. <i>See Westmoreland,</i> 246 F.3d at 244. But even without reference to the detailed BEAR procedures, it is clear that Congress intended money from the USF to pay only for certain very specific activities. <i>See</i> 47 U.S.C. &#167; 254(e) (USF funds shall be used \"only for the provision, maintenance, and upgrading of facilities and services for which the support is intended\"). LAN Tamers has already been paid for the eligible services it provided; allowing USF funds to pay its other debts would violate this congressional mandate. <i>See Buchanan,</i> 45 U.S.(4 How.) at 20-21 (\"The funds of the government are specifically appropriated to certain national objects, and if such appropriations may be diverted and defeated by state process or otherwise, the functions of the government may be suspended.\"); <i>Joliet-Will,</i> 847 F.2d at 432 (\"Congress is traditionally chary\" of allowing funds of government programs to be diverted from their stated purposes).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we note that this conclusion also prevents the creditors from receiving a windfall of double payment for the work LAN Tamers completed in Springfield's schools. If LAN Tamers had not filed for bankruptcy, it could hardly sue USAC in its own right to be paid again, having received full payment for its services from Springfield long before. Once USAC issued the check to LAN Tamers, the company could not have diverted the funds to its creditors or to other purposes without \"facing enforcement action.\" At most, LAN Tamers arguably would hold bare legal title to the reimbursements for a short time.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> It is a fundamental principle of bankruptcy law \"that the estate can only succeed to the same property interest that the debtor possesses, and cannot achieve a greater interest.\" 5 L.P.

A conclusion that the reimbursements should be distributed to the creditors would flout this basic premise. It would provide a windfall to the creditors at the expense of Springfield's public schools and its students, contrary to the dictates of the statutory and regulatory text underlying the E-Rate program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustee seeks to undermine this conclusion in a variety of ways.

He argues that it applies solely to trusts that would be recognized under state law, in this case Massachusetts law. He further argues that the conditions of Massachusetts trust law are not satisfied here. We need not determine if the second contention is correct, because we reject the first. There is no basis for a per se rule limiting &#167; 541(d) to state law trusts under all circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court unanimously rejected such a \"state law only\" interpretation in <i>Patterson v.

That case concerned the exclusion in &#167; 541(c)(2): \"A restriction on the transfer of a beneficial interest of the debtor in a trust that is enforceable under applicable nonbankruptcy law is enforceable in a case under [the Bankruptcy Code].\" A beneficiary of a pension plan that was covered by the antialienation provision of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1056(d)(1) (1988), claimed that his interest in the plan was excluded from his bankruptcy estate because ERISA served as \"applicable nonbankruptcy law\" restricting its transfer. The <i>Patterson</i> Court rejected an argument that the phrase applies only to state law, and not ERISA, finding that interpretation contrary to a \"natural reading of the provision.\" 504 U.S. at 758, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112754\"><a href=\"/opinion/112754/patterson-v-shumate/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In the absence of any language specifically incorporating state law in the <i>exclusions,</i> the \"natural reading\" of &#167; 541(d), like the <i>Patterson</i> Court's reading of &#167; 541(c)(2), cuts against the trustee's proposed construction that it incorporates and is restricted by state law in all situations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that state law often provides the applicable rules for bankruptcy determinations in the absence of other imperatives.

In short, \"Section 541 eliminates exclusive reliance on state law in determining what constitutes property of the estate but recognizes the traditional role of the states in creating and defining the underlying property interests and commercial arrangements to which bankruptcy law applies.\" <i>Branch v.

Where there are significant federal interests involved, the default rule of applying state standards to bankruptcy determinations may yield.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Here, the statutory and regulatory framework for the E-Rate program, established under the Telecom Act, provides a federal definition of the property interests involved in this case. That definition takes account of the federal government's aspiration, expressed in the Telecom Act and promoted by the activities of the FCC and USAC, that \"[e]lementary and secondary schools and classrooms ... should have access to advanced telecommunications services.\" 47 U.S.C. &#167; 254(b)(6). As such, it is the definition that we apply. <i>See Calore Express,</i> 288 F.3d at 43-44 (choice of standard guided by protection of strong federal interests).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Just as the language of &#167; 541(d) does not invariably incorporate state law, it is not always limited to trusts either. To be sure, since the separation of legal and equitable interests is characteristic of a trust, there will be overlap. In some of the cases discussed above, courts classified the excluded property as the corpus of a trust of some kind. <i>E.g., Columbia Gas,</i> 997 F.2d at 1059-60; <i>Yonkers,</i> 58 B.R. at 983. The bankruptcy court here did so as well. <i>Lan Tamers,</i> 281 B.R. at 792. And Congress referred to a \"constructive trust\" in the insurance hypothetical quoted earlier.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This usage may prove confusing, however, because these supposed trusts might lack characteristics of trusts recognized for other purposes under state law. We think it better to avoid the language of trusts and rest our holding more simply on the fact that LAN Tamers, as a mere delivery vehicle, lacked an equitable interest in the reimbursements under the federal program.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> <i>See</i> R.J. Keach, <i>The Continued Unsettled State of Constructive Trusts in Bankruptcy,</i> 103 Com. L.J. 411, 446, 449 n. 172 (1998) (distinguishing \"true conduit\" cases from constructive trust cases); <i>cf. Joliet-Will,</i> 847 F.2d at 433 (criticizing characterization of government's interest in debtor's grant funds as \"equitable lien\" for similar reasons).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustee also argues that the Supreme Court's recent decision in <i>FCC v. NextWave Personal Communications, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"122257\"><a href=\"/opinion/122257/fcc-v-nextwave-personal-communications-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">293</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"122257\"><a href=\"/opinion/122257/fcc-v-nextwave-personal-communications-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">863</span></a></span> (2003), requires a different outcome. In <i>NextWave,</i> the debtor had purchased broadband spectrum licenses in an FCC auction, and arranged to pay for them in installments. When the debtor fell behind in its payments and filed for bankruptcy, the FCC tried to revoke the licenses, but the Court held that it could not. The licenses remained property of the estate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two enormous differences between <i>NextWave</i> and this case. First, FCC licenses have many qualities of property in which the licensee holds beneficial interest, sweeping them out of the &#167; 541(d) exclusion and into the broad overall definition of property of the estate. <i>See Ramsay v. Dowden, (In re Cent. Ark. Broad. Co.),</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"706069\"><a href=\"/opinion/706069/bankr-l-rep-p-76660-in-re-central-arkansas-broadcasting-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">68</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">213</span></a></span>, 214-15 (8th Cir.1995) (per curiam). The licensee secures the right to engage in communications activities and keep the resulting profit for itself &#8212; rather than serving solely as a vehicle delivering benefits to another &#8212; and does so under less pervasive regulatory supervision. <i>See Westmoreland,</i> 246 F.3d at 253-54 (distinguishing broadcast licenses from contract rights under a grant).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second distinction between this case and <i>NextWave</i> is that <i>NextWave</i> relied heavily on specific language in the Bankruptcy Code barring the government from revoking a license on the basis of a debtor's nonpayment. <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167; 525(a). The Court rejected the FCC's argument that its regulatory authority trumped this prohibition. <i>Nextwave,</i> 537 U.S. at ___ - ___, 123 S.Ct. at 838-40. As such, it invalidated the purported revocation as \"not in accordance with law\" under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. &#167; 706(2)(A) (2000). <i>See Nextwave,</i> 537 U.S. at ___, 123 S.Ct. at 838. Here, in contrast, the trustee points to no similar provision of the Code that applies to the reimbursements and stands in opposition to the federal rules derived from the E-Rate program's regulatory scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, throughout his briefs the trustee emphasizes the importance in bankruptcy law of equal footing for similarly placed creditors. The argument assumes that Springfield is indeed a creditor similar to the others. This bankruptcy policy is not implicated, however, when the property in question is not legitimately available to creditors in the first place. <i>See Begier v. IRS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112445\"><a href=\"/opinion/112445/begier-v-irs/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span>, 58, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112445\"><a href=\"/opinion/112445/begier-v-irs/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The true harm to creditors is minimal here anyway, because the legal and regulatory impediment to using the reimbursements for other purposes makes bare legal title to them an asset of almost no value. <i>See Westmoreland,</i> 246 F.3d at 244 (restrictions on housing grants so limit their transferability that grantee's interest is \"essentially valueless\"). LAN Tamers served only as a delivery vehicle for federally regulated reimbursements derived from the USF, not as an owner of those funds (or of the right to receive them).
