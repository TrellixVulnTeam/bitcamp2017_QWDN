Joseph A. DiClerico, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n              Torruella and Selya, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Bjorn Lange, Assistant Federal Public Defender, Federal\nDefender Office, on brief for appellant.\n     Mark E. Howard, Assistant United States Attorney, and Thomas\nP. Colantuono, United States Attorney, on brief for the United\nStates.\n\n\n\n                          July 29, 2003\n\f           Per Curiam.       In 1996, John Brennick pled guilty to a\n\ncharge of federal bank larceny and was sentenced to 87 months\n\nimprisonment followed by 36 months supervised release.           He served\n\nthe prison term without mishap, but trouble started soon after his\n\nrelease on October 18, 2002.        On December 14, he left a message for\n\nhis supervising officer, Kevin Lavigne, claiming to be confused\n\nabout the logistics of his scheduled drug test.         Two days later, he\n\nmissed his drug testing appointment.         Officer Lavigne reprimanded\n\nBrennick and told him to report for testing the next day.            Brennick\n\ndid not show up.   On December 18, Brennick admitted to Lavigne that\n\nhe had relapsed into cocaine use, and the following day he gave a\n\nurine sample that tested positive for cocaine metabolites.\n\n           In the following weeks, Brennick appears to have gone on\n\nan extensive crime spree.      Only the last episode of that spree is\n\nrelevant here: on December 29, 2002, Brennick was arrested after a\n\nfailed attempt to elude the police in a high-speed car chase.\n\nBrennick did not surrender voluntarily but crashed the car he was\n\ndriving--a car not his own and with a screwdriver in the ignition\n\ninstead of keys.\n\n           On January 7, 2003, Officer Lavigne filed a petition\n\ncharging   Brennick   with    six    violations   of   the   terms    of   his\n\nsupervised release--three violations stemming from the car chase,\n\ntwo from non-compliance with the instructions of his supervising\n\nofficer, and one based on possession of cocaine.             Under federal\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\flaw, an offender who commits a crime while on supervised release\n\ncan have the release revoked and be returned to prison.         18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3583(e)(3) (2000); U.S.S.G. § 7B1.1 (2002).       The revocation is\n\ndesigned to punish an offender's breach of trust in violating the\n\ncourt-ordered terms of release, so the sanction is independent of--\n\nand potentially in addition to--regular criminal prosecution for\n\nthe crime.   U.S.S.G ch. 7, pt. A, introductory cmt. b.\n\n          Any \"federal, state, or local offense\" is deemed a\n\nviolation of the terms of release.       U.S.S.G. § 7B1.1(a).          The\n\nguidelines divide release violations into three categories by type\n\nand severity of offense.   U.S.S.G. § 7B1.1(a).     Two categories are\n\nrelevant here:\n\n          (2) Grade B Violations--conduct constituting any [non-\n          grade A] federal, state, or local offense punishable by\n          a term of imprisonment exceeding one year.\n\n          (3) Grade C Violations--conduct constituting (A) a\n          federal, state, or local offense punishable by a term of\n          imprisonment of one year or less; or (B) a violation of\n          any other condition of supervision.\n\nU.S.S.G. §   7B1.1(a)(2)&(3).    The   guidelines   set   out    a   mini-\n\nsentencing table using the grade of the release violation and the\n\noffender's criminal history to determine the appropriate sentence.\n\nU.S.S.G. § 7B1.4.    If the defendant is found to have committed\n\n\"conduct that constitutes more than one offense, the grade of the\n\nviolation is determined by the violation having the most serious\n\ngrade.\" U.S.S.G. § 7B1.1(b).\n\n\n\n                                -3-\n\f            Applying this framework to Brennick's case, the district\n\ncourt found Brennick guilty of all six violations on February 4,\n\n2003.    The court further determined that one of the six offenses--\n\npossession    of   cocaine--was   a    grade   B   violation   since   it   was\n\npunishable by more than one year of prison under New Hampshire law.\n\nU.S.S.G. § 7B1.1(a)(2).       All of Brennick's other offenses were\n\ngrade C violations.     Brennick's substantial criminal record placed\n\nhim in criminal history category VI, so the relevant sentencing\n\nrange for his release violation was 21-27 months.                U.S.S.G. §\n\n7B1.4.     The district judge sentenced him to the statutory maximum\n\nof 24 months.      18 U.S.C. § 3583(e)(3).\n\n             At issue in this appeal is whether Brennick's simple\n\npossession of cocaine was properly classified as a class B felony\n\nunder U.S.S.G. § 7B1.1(a)(2).         Had Brennick committed only class C\n\noffenses, the relevant sentencing range would have been 8-14\n\nmonths, far less than the 24 months he received.          U.S.S.G. § 7B1.4.\n\nSince Brennick challenges the district court's interpretation of\n\nthe guidelines, not findings of fact, our review is de novo.\n\nUnited States v. Mateo, 271 F.3d 11, 13 (1st Cir. 2001); United\n\nStates v.    St. Cyr, 977 F.2d 698, 701 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n            Both parties agree that simple possession of a controlled\n\nsubstance is not a class B violation under federal law; because it\n\ncarries a maximum penalty of one year in prison, it is a class C\n\noffense.     21 U.S.C. § 844(a) (2000).            The guidelines, however,\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fclassify as a grade B violation any conduct that constitutes a\n\n\"federal,   state,   or   local   offense    punishable   by   a    term    of\n\nimprisonment exceeding one year.\"        U.S.S.G. § 7B1.1(2).      Under New\n\nHampshire law, possession of a controlled substance is a felony\n\npunishable by up to seven years in prison.        N.H.R.S.A. 318-B:26(c)\n\n(2003).     Nevertheless, Brennick argues that the New Hampshire\n\nclassification should not be used in this case for two quite\n\ndifferent reasons.\n\n            His first argument is based on the guidelines' statement\n\nthat \"[w]here there is more than one violation of the conditions of\n\nsupervision, or the violation includes conduct that constitutes\n\nmore than one offense, the grade of the violation is determined by\n\nthe violation having the most serious grade.\" U.S.S.G. § 7B1.1(b)\n\n(emphasis added).    Brennick argues that this provision \"does not\n\naddress conduct which ... amounts to the same offense under both\n\nfederal and state law\"; he urges us to conclude that the guidelines\n\nare ambiguous as to how such conduct should be treated, and to\n\napply the rule of lenity to resolve the ambiguity in his favor.\n\nSee United States v. Bowen, 127 F.3d 9, 13-14 (1st Cir. 1997)\n\n(applying rule of lenity).\n\n            Strictly speaking, conduct that violates the laws of two\n\ndifferent   sovereigns    constitutes    \"more   than   one   offense\"     and\n\nrepresents two different \"violations.\"        See Heath v. Alabama, 474\n\nU.S. 82, 88 (1985) (\"When a defendant in a single act violates the\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f'peace and dignity' of two sovereigns by breaking the laws of each,\n\nhe has committed two distinct 'offences.'\" (quoting United States\n\nv. Lanza, 260 U.S. 377, 382 (1922))).     Perhaps the drafters of this\n\nguideline were thinking principally about cases where two or more\n\noffenses each involved different conduct, but the guideline's\n\nlanguage fits the present case like a glove.           Like the Ninth\n\nCircuit, we see no ambiguity.    United States v. Jolibois, 294 F.3d\n\n1110, 1113 (9th Cir. 2002).\n\n           Further, treating the New Hampshire classification as\n\ncontrolling on these facts serves what appears to be the underlying\n\npolicy of the guideline. Ordinarily, in administering a regime for\n\nfederal sentencing, one might expect that a federal classification\n\nshould prevail over a state classification and, indeed, that\n\nreliance   on   state   classifications   would   introduce   arbitrary\n\ndisparities depending upon how the law in the particular state\n\ntreated the underlying conduct.        But the guideline itself makes\n\nclear that here, as in certain other instances, e.g. § 2L1.2,\n\nfederal and state classifications are both relevant and that\n\nCongress favored use of the one that produces the more serious\n\npenalty.   Jolibois, 294 F.3d at 1113-14.\n\n           As it happens, in United States v. Restrepo-Aguilar, 74\n\nF.3d 361 (1st Cir. 1996), we dealt with a parallel problem of\n\nguideline interpretation and reached a comparable result.       There,\n\na substantial upward adjustment turned on whether a state drug\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fpossession offense was regarded as a misdemeanor or felony; state\n\nlaw treated it as a felony, but comparable conduct under federal\n\nlaw would be only a misdemeanor.       Id. at 363-64.   The guidelines\n\nexplained that the relevant definition of felony applied equally to\n\noffenses \"in violation of federal or state law.\" § 2L1.2, cmt. n.7\n\n(1994).\n\n          In Restrepo, we said that the guidelines' \"'explicit\n\nreliance on state classifications represents a Congressional choice\n\nto include within the category of 'felony' offenses ... those\n\ncrimes deemed serious enough by states to warrant felony treatment\n\nwithin their jurisdictions.'\"     Restrepo-Aguilar, 74 F.3d at 365\n\n(quoting Jenkins v. INS, 32 F.3d 11, 14 (2d Cir. 1994)).         In a\n\nsimilar manner, the guideline at issue in this appeal directs use\n\nof the state or federal classification having the most serious\n\ngrade--which in this case means New Hampshire's classification.\n\nU.S.S.G. § 7B1.1.   Any \"lack of uniformity\" that may result \"is the\n\nconsequence of a deliberate policy choice by Congress and the\n\nCommission that we cannot disregard.\" Restrepo-Aguilar, 74 F.3d at\n\n366.\n\n          Brennick's second attack on the district court's judgment\n\nfares no better.    Brennick asserts that the evidence presented at\n\nhis revocation hearing--including his confession and positive drug\n\ntest--would have been legally insufficient for conviction if he had\n\nbeen tried in New Hampshire state courts.       Therefore, he argues,\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\freliance on the state law offense to determine the grade of\n\nsupervised release violation is improper.\n\n             Both parties seem to proceed on the premise that it\n\nmatters whether Brennick could be convicted under New Hampshire's\n\nown treatment of the evidence in this case.                Yet the guidelines do\n\nnot require the district judge to determine whether the defendant\n\ncould be convicted under the particular evidentiary standards that\n\nprevail in state courts; rather, they direct the federal judge to\n\ndetermine if the defendant has engaged in conduct that constitutes\n\nan offense under state law.          U.S.S.G. § 7B1.1.       This determination\n\nis made using the flexible process of proof prescribed for federal\n\nrevocation hearings.          See Fed. R. Crim. P. 32.1(a)(2) (advisory\n\ncommittee notes); Fed. R. Evid. 1101(d)(3).                 Arguably, a state's\n\nevidentiary     standards      are   irrelevant     in     making   this   federal\n\ndetermination.\n\n             In any event, there is no doubt that the evidence against\n\nBrennick would suffice for conviction in New Hampshire courts.                  In\n\nfederal courts, a positive drug test is sufficient to show that a\n\ndefendant possessed the drugs.            United States v. Dow, 990 F.2d 22,\n\n24 (1st Cir. 1993) (collecting cases); see also United States v.\n\nTrotter, 270 F.3d 1150, 1153-54, 1154 (7th Cir. 2001) (collecting\n\ncases).      There is no reason to doubt that a New Hampshire court\n\nwould   be    equally   willing      to   accept    such    powerful   scientific\n\nevidence.       The   cases    Brennick     cites    as    requiring   additional\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fevidence of     possession   did   not    involve   drug   tests;   all   were\n\ndisputes over constructive possession where the additional evidence\n\nwas required to link a particular defendant to drugs found on the\n\npremises.     See, e.g., State v. Cartier, 575 A.2d 347, 349 (N.H.\n\n1990); State v. Francoeur, 445 A.2d 1095, 1096 (N.H. 1982).\n\n            Further, in this case the evidence was not limited to the\n\ndrug test: Brennick confessed to using drugs. Brennick argues that\n\nan uncorroborated confession is not sufficient under New Hampshire\n\nlaw to support a conviction.        On this point he does have solid\n\nprecedent.    State v. Zysk, 465 A.2d 480, 483 (N.H. 1983); State v.\n\nGeorge, 257 A.2d 19, 20-21 (N.H. 1969).             But in this case the\n\nevidence included both a confession and corroborating evidence--the\n\npositive drug test.      Since a corroborated confession is sufficient\n\nto uphold a conviction, there is virtually no doubt that Brennick\n\nwould have been convicted in state court.\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\f",

The revocation is designed to punish an offender's breach of trust in violating the court-ordered terms of release, so the sanction is independent of &#8212; and potentially in addition to &#8212; regular criminal prosecution for the crime.

The guidelines, however, classify as a grade B violation any conduct that constitutes a \"federal, state, or local offense punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 7B1.1(2). Under New Hampshire law, possession of a controlled substance is a felony punishable by up to seven years in prison. N.H.R.S.A. 318 B:26(c) (2003).

Bowen,</i> 127 F.3d 9, 13-14 (1st Cir.1997) (applying rule of lenity).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Strictly speaking, conduct that violates the laws of two different sovereigns constitutes \"more than one offense\" and represents two different \"violations.\" <i>See Heath v. Alabama,</i> 474 U.S. 82, 88, 106 S.Ct. 433, 88 L.Ed.2d 387 (1985) (\"When a defendant in a single act violates the `peace and dignity' of two sovereigns by breaking the laws of each, he has committed two distinct `offences.'\" (quoting <i>United States v. Lanza,</i> 260 U.S. 377, 382, 43 S.Ct. 141, 67 L.Ed. 314 (1922))). Perhaps the drafters of this guideline were thinking principally about cases where two or more offenses each involved different conduct, but the guideline's language fits the present case like a glove. Like the Ninth Circuit, we see no ambiguity. <i>United States v.

Ordinarily, in administering a regime for federal sentencing, one might expect that a federal classification should prevail over a state classification and, indeed, that reliance on state classifications would introduce arbitrary disparities depending upon how the law in the particular state treated the underlying conduct. But the guideline itself makes clear that here, as in certain other instances, <i>e.g.</i> &#167; 2L1.2, federal and state classifications are both relevant and that Congress favored use of the one that produces the more serious penalty. <i>Jolibois,</i> 294 F.3d at 1113-14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As it happens, in <i>United States v.

There, a substantial upward adjustment turned on whether a state drug possession offense was regarded as a misdemeanor or felony; state law treated it as a felony, but comparable conduct under federal law would be only a misdemeanor. <i>Id.</i> at 363-64. The guidelines explained that the relevant definition of felony applied equally to offenses \"in violation of federal or state law.\" &#167; 2L1.2, cmt. n. 7 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Restrepo,</i> we said that the guidelines \"`explicit reliance on state classifications represents a Congressional choice to include within the category of `felony' offenses... those crimes deemed serious enough by states to warrant felony treatment within their jurisdictions.'\" <i>Restrepo Aguilar,</i> 74 F.3d at 365 (quoting <i>Jenkins v.

Brennick asserts that the evidence presented at his revocation hearing &#8212; including his confession and positive drug test &#8212; would have been legally insufficient for conviction if he had been tried in New Hampshire state courts.

U.S.S.G. &#167; 7B1.1. This determination is made using the flexible process of proof prescribed for federal revocation hearings. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.1(a)(2) (advisory committee notes); Fed.R.Evid. 1101(d)(3).

There is no reason to doubt that a New Hampshire court would be equally willing to accept such powerful scientific evidence. The cases Brennick cites as requiring additional evidence of possession did not involve drug tests; all were disputes over constructive possession where the additional evidence was required to link a particular defendant to drugs found on the premises. <i>See, e.g., State v.

He served the prison term without mishap, but trouble started soon after his release on October 18, 2002. On December 14, he left a message for his supervising officer, Kevin Lavigne, claiming to be confused about the logistics of his scheduled drug test. Two days later, he missed his drug testing appointment. Officer Lavigne reprimanded Brennick and told him to report for testing the next day. Brennick did not show up. On December 18, Brennick admitted to Lavigne that he had relapsed into cocaine use, and the following day he gave a urine sample that tested positive for cocaine metabolites.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the following weeks, Brennick appears to have gone on an extensive crime spree. Only the last episode of that spree is relevant here: on December 29, 2002, Brennick was arrested after a failed attempt to elude the police in a high-speed car chase. Brennick did not surrender voluntarily but crashed the car he was driving &#8212; a car not his own and with a screwdriver in the ignition instead of keys.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 7, 2003, Officer Lavigne filed a petition charging Brennick with six violations of the terms of his supervised release &#8212; three violations stemming from the car chase, two from non-compliance with the instructions of his supervising officer, and one based on possession of cocaine. Under federal law, an offender who commits a crime while on supervised release can have the release revoked and be returned to prison. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(e)(3) (2000); U.S.S.G. &#167; 7B1.1 (2002). The revocation is designed to punish an offender's breach of trust in violating the court-ordered terms of release, so the sanction is independent of &#8212; and potentially in addition to &#8212; regular criminal prosecution for the crime. U.S.S.G ch. 7, pt. A, introductory cmt. b.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any \"federal, state, or local offense\" is deemed a violation of the terms of release. U.S.S.G. &#167; 7B1.1(a). The guidelines divide release violations into three categories by type and severity of offense. U.S.S.G. &#167; 7B1.1(a). Two categories are relevant here:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) <i>Grade B Violations</i> &#8212; conduct constituting any [non-grade A] federal, state, or local offense punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) <i>Grade C Violations</i> &#8212; conduct constituting (A) a federal, state, or local offense punishable by a term of imprisonment of one year or less; or (B) a violation of any other condition of supervision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 7B1.1(a)(2) &amp; (3). The guidelines set out a mini-sentencing table using the grade of the release violation and the offender's criminal history to determine the appropriate sentence. U.S.S.G. &#167; 7B1.4. If the defendant is found to have committed \"conduct that constitutes more than one offense, the grade of the violation is determined by the violation having the most serious grade.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 7B1.1(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying this framework to Brennick's case, the district court found Brennick guilty of all six violations on February 4, 2003. The court further determined that one of the six offenses &#8212; possession of cocaine &#8212; was a grade B violation since it was punishable by more than one year of prison under New Hampshire law. U.S.S.G. &#167; 7B1.1(a)(2). All of Brennick's other offenses were grade C violations. Brennick's substantial criminal record placed him in criminal history category VI, so the relevant sentencing range for his release violation was 21-27 months. U.S.S.G. &#167; 7B1.4. The district judge sentenced him to the statutory maximum of 24 months. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(e)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At issue in this appeal is whether Brennick's simple possession of cocaine was properly classified as a class B felony under U.S.S.G. &#167; 7B1.1(a)(2). Had Brennick committed only class C offenses, the relevant sentencing range would have been 8-14 months, far less than the 24 months he received. U.S.S.G. &#167; 7B1.4. Since Brennick challenges the district court's interpretation of the guidelines, not findings of fact, our review is de novo. <i>United States v.

The guidelines, however, classify as a grade B violation any conduct that constitutes a \"federal, state, or local offense punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 7B1.1(2). Under New Hampshire law, possession of a controlled substance is a felony punishable by up to seven years in prison. N.H.R.S.A. 318 B:26(c) (2003).

George,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2078819\"><a href=\"/opinion/2078819/state-v-george/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">531</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></span>, 20-21 (1969). But in this case the evidence included both a confession and corroborating evidence &#8212; the positive drug test. Since a <i>corroborated</i> confession is sufficient to uphold a conviction, there is virtually no doubt that Brennick would have been convicted in state court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    ",
