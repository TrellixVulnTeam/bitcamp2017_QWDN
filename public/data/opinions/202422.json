Joseph A.

In this appeal, we must review the\n\ndistrict court's decision to vacate an arbitration award and remand\n\non the ground that the award was in manifest disregard of the law.\n\nIn an unusual circumstance, this is the second time in this case\n\nthat the district court has vacated an arbitration award in favor\n\nof the appellee and remanded on that ground.\n\n            The award of the arbitration panel was not in manifest\n\ndisregard of the law.     Instead, the district court engaged in an\n\nanalysis of the merits of the arbitration panel's award and found\n\nlegal error.    Such an analysis is proscribed by the standards of\n\nreview that apply in this circuit to a district court's review of\n\narbitration awards. Therefore, we must vacate the district court's\n\nruling and direct the district court to enter a judgment confirming\n\nthe arbitration award.\n\n                                 I.\n\nA.   Factual Background\n\n            Plaintiff James W. McCarthy (\"McCarthy\") was a financial\n\nconsultant at Smith Barney, predecessor of Defendant Citigroup\n\nGlobal Markets Inc. (\"CGMI\"), from 1985 until his resignation in\n\nMay 2003.    As of 1993, he worked in the Manchester, New Hampshire\n\noffice of CGMI.   CGMI is an investment bank and brokerage firm with\n\nits principal place of business in New York City.          It is a\n\nsubsidiary of Citigroup Inc., one of the world's largest financial\n\nservices companies.\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\f           While an employee, McCarthy participated in the Capital\n\nAccumulation Plan (\"CAP Plan\"), which was sponsored by CGMI's\n\nparent company, Traveler's Group, Inc.                The CAP Plan is a program\n\ndesigned to retain employees by giving them the opportunity to\n\npurchase restricted shares of Citigroup, either in the form of\n\nCitigroup restricted stock at discounted prices on a tax-deferred\n\nbasis, or as grants of non-qualified stock options for Citigroup\n\ncommon stock.     An eligible employee must sign, at least annually,\n\na form electing to participate in the CAP Plan, wherein the\n\nemployee designates the amount of earnings he wants deducted from\n\nhis paychecks and used in the CAP Plan.\n\n           Under     the    CAP   Plan     restricted        stock   program,    the\n\nrestricted   stock    is    acquired     at     a    twenty-five     percent    (25%)\n\ndiscount from market value and is purchased with wage deductions\n\nfrom payroll checks.        However, the stock purchases are subject to\n\na vesting period of two years.             When the restricted shares vest,\n\nthe participant pays ordinary income taxes and payroll taxes based\n\non the market value of the shares on the vesting date, unless the\n\nparticipant has elected to pay taxes at the time of the payroll\n\ndeduction.      McCarthy had paid income and payroll taxes on many of\n\nthe shares at issue here.             If a participant in the CAP Plan\n\nresigns,   as    McCarthy    did,    the    participant       forfeits    both   the\n\nunvested   restricted       shares   and       the   wages    deducted   from    the\n\npaychecks.       The unvested restricted shares are cancelled, the\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\funderlying restricted Citigroup stock reverts to Citigroup, and\n\nCGMI does not return the wages to the participant.    Under the CAP\n\nPlan stock option program, a participant can choose to receive up\n\nto one-third of the restricted shares in the form of non-qualified\n\nstock options on Citigroup common stock.   If employment terminates\n\nvoluntarily, unvested options may not be exercised.     As with the\n\nrestricted stock program, when an option is exercised, income and\n\npayroll taxes are withheld.\n\n           McCarthy resigned on May 9, 2003.    From 1993 until his\n\nresignation, McCarthy voluntarily elected in writing to direct the\n\nequivalent of 20-25% of his compensation to be invested through the\n\nCAP Plan. He participated mostly in the restricted stock plan, but\n\nat times also purchased stock options under the CAP Plan. McCarthy\n\nsought to recover his contributions to the CAP Plan that had\n\nresulted in the purchase of unvested shares, as well as funds that\n\nhad not been used to purchase shares.   Pursuant to the terms of the\n\nCAP Plan, these contributions had been forfeited.\n\nB.   Procedural Background\n\n           Pursuant to the parties' arbitration agreement and the\n\nregulatory framework of the securities industry, McCarthy commenced\n\narbitration proceedings against CGMI with the National Association\n\nof Securities Dealers (\"NASD\") on December 29, 2003.1      McCarthy\n\n\n      1\n        The NASD is the primary self-regulatory organization\nresponsible for the regulation of persons and companies involved in\nthe securities industry in the United States, with delegated\n\n                               -4-\n\fasserted statutory claims under the New Hampshire wage laws (the\n\n\"Wage Law\") and equitable claims.\n\n          A hearing was held on November 18, 2004 (the \"First\n\nHearing\").   The arbitrators in the First Hearing (the \"First\n\nPanel\") ruled in favor of CGMI and dismissed McCarthy's claims (the\n\n\"First Award\"):2\n\n     [McCarthy's] request for relief is denied. The evidence\n     and documents presented in evidence at the hearing\n     demonstrated that [McCarthy] knowingly and willingly\n     participated in the [CAP Plan] by signing the election\n     forms twice a year for several years.         [McCarthy]\n     benefitted financially from participation in the [CAP\n     Plan] to a substantial degree over the years.       While\n     [McCarthy] invoked New Hampshire wage law to support his\n     case, the Panel considered it irrelevant because the\n     Panel considered the case to be a contract dispute\n     regarding an inventive compensation plan commonly used at\n     the firm and commonly used in the securities industry.\n\nOn December 16, 2004, McCarthy asked the district court to vacate\n\nthe First Award.   CGMI cross-moved to confirm it.   Focusing on the\n\nlanguage above, the district court remanded the matter to the NASD\n\nfor further arbitration proceedings (\"First Remand Order\"):\n\n\n\nauthority from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. See\n\"About NASD\", http://www.nasd.com/AboutNASD/index.htm (last visited\nAugust 15, 2006).\n     2\n       In the context of arbitration, an \"award\" can denote both\nthe decision an arbitration panel reaches and the authenticated\ndocument containing the decision. See 2 Martin Domke, Domke on\nCommercial Arbitration, Appx. B-1 ยง 19(a) (3d. ed. 2003)(\"An\narbitrator shall make a record of an award. The record must be\nsigned or otherwise authenticated by any arbitrator who concurs\nwith the award. The arbitrator or the arbitration organization\nshall give notice of the award, including a copy of the award, to\neach party to the arbitration proceeding.\").\n\n                                -5-\n\f      The [arbitration] panel does not appear to have intended\n      \"irrelevant\" to have its usual meaning.     Instead, the\n      panel concluded that McCarthy was not protected by the\n      wage laws because he had profited from the CAP in the\n      past and had voluntarily agreed to its terms. As such,\n      the panel acknowledged the applicability of the wage laws\n      but decided not to apply them because of the\n      circumstances attending McCarthy's claim. The panel also\n      decided not to consider the wage laws because plans like\n      the CAP are commonly used in the securities industry. In\n      doing so, the panel set aside the governing law in favor\n      of its perception of an equitable result and industry\n      practices. The panel's decision not to consider the New\n      Hampshire wage laws demonstrates its disregard for the\n      governing law.\n\nThe district court concluded that \"the case must be remanded to\n\nhave McCarthy's claim decided under the New Hampshire wage laws\n\nthrough arbitration.\" Although CGMI filed an appeal from the First\n\nRemand Order (the \"First Appeal\"), it never pursued that First\n\nAppeal. Instead, CGMI voluntarily withdrew it. On March 18, 2005,\n\nwe entered a judgment dismissing the First Appeal and sending the\n\ncase back to the district court.\n\n            McCarthy re-filed his claim with the NASD, which convened\n\na second arbitration panel comprised of three new arbitrators (the\n\n\"Second Panel\").     McCarthy withdrew all of his equitable claims,\n\nmoving forward with only his claims based on New Hampshire law.\n\nThe parties submitted briefs to the Second Panel, along with copies\n\nof the Wage Law, case law, the district court's First Remand Order,\n\nthe   CAP   Plan   documents,   and    exhibits   reflecting   McCarthy's\n\nparticipation in the CAP Plan. The Second Panel heard argument and\n\ntestimony from several witnesses on August 2, 2005 (the \"Second\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fHearing\").       CGMI argued that the CAP Plan did not violate the Wage\n\nLaw and, in the alternative, that McCarthy was not entitled to any\n\ndamages regardless of the status of the CAP Plan under the Wage\n\nLaw.3       McCarthy asserted that the First Remand Order required the\n\nSecond Panel to apply the Wage Law to his claims, and under the\n\nWage Law the CAP Plan was illegal.         On August 18, 2005, the Second\n\nPanel issued its award denying McCarthy's claims with prejudice\n\n(the \"Modified Award\"):\n\n        [McCarthy] requested that the panel . . . declare that\n        the CAP Plan is illegal under New Hampshire law, to the\n        extent the CAP Plan is implemented (i) through wage\n        deductions, which are not actually used to purchase stock\n        in Citigroup, or (ii) so as to cause employees to forfeit\n        wages.\n\n        . . .\n\n        The Panel heard testimony from [McCarthy] and witnesses\n        of both parties and considered the documentary evidence\n        from each side as well. The Arbitrators fully considered\n        all claims and defenses, including the applicability of\n        the New Hampshire Wage Laws, which were heavily argued on\n        both sides . . . .     After full consideration of the\n        matter, the panel decided to deny all claims with\n        prejudice.\n\n                On September 8, 2005, McCarthy filed with the district\n\ncourt a motion to vacate the Modified Award, asserting again that\n\nthe     arbitrators    had   manifestly    disregarded   controlling   law.\n\nMcCarthy also claimed that the award should be vacated because CGMI\n\n\n        3\n       CGMI asserted that \"McCarthy is not entitled to any damages\nbecause, if he held all his vested shares, McCarthy netted over one\nmillion dollars from voluntarily participating in the CAP Plan, and\nCGMI is entitled to recover those shares or their market value in\nexcess of McCarthy's cost of any unvested stock.\"\n\n                                     -7-\n\fimproperly     encouraged      the    arbitrators    to     ignore   the     district\n\ncourt's legal findings as they were set forth in the First Remand\n\nOrder, and because the arbitrators refused to be polled as to\n\nwhether they would follow the law. CGMI again filed a cross-motion\n\nfor confirmation of the award.\n\n             In a Second Remand Order dated December 15, 2005, the\n\ndistrict     court   vacated    the    Modified     Award    because    it    was   in\n\nmanifest disregard of the law, denied CGMI's cross-motion for\n\nconfirmation of the award, and remanded the case for a third\n\narbitration proceeding, if necessary (the court urged the parties\n\nto settle).4\n\n                                        II.\n\nA.   Standard of review\n\n             We review a district court's decision to vacate or\n\nconfirm an arbitration award de novo.             See Bull HN Info. Sys., Inc.\n\nv. Hutson, 229 F.3d 321, 330 (1st Cir. 2000).                 The touchstone for\n\nreview of arbitration awards is 9 U.S.C. ยง 10.5                        \"Section 10\n\n\n     4\n       In the Second Remand Order, the district court rejected\nMcCarthy's \"polling\" argument, stating that McCarthy had \"cited no\ncase or any other legal authority supporting his request for a\npoll.\" McCarthy did not renew this argument on appeal and we do\nnot address it.\n      5\n          In relevant part, 9 U.S.C. ยง 10 states:\n\n     (a) In any of the following cases the United States court\n     in and for the district wherein the award was made may\n     make an order vacating the award upon the application of\n     any party to the arbitration --\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fauthorizes vacatur of an award in cases of specified misconduct or\n\nmisbehavior on the arbitrators' part, actions in excess of arbitral\n\npowers, or failures to consummate the award.\"               Advest, Inc., v.\n\nMcCarthy, 914 F.2d 6, 8 (1st Cir. 1990); see also Nat'l Cas. Co. v.\n\nFirst State Ins. Group, 430 F.3d 492, 497 n.4 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n\"Courts    do,    however,   retain    a   very   limited   power   to   review\n\narbitration awards outside of section 10.\"           Advest, 914 F.2d at 8.\n\nAs we have put it:\n\n       In the main, a successful challenge to an arbitration\n       award, apart from section 10, depends upon the\n       challenger's ability to show that the award is (1)\n       unfounded in reason and fact; (2) based on reasoning so\n       palpably faulty that no judge, or group of judges, ever\n       could conceivably have made such a ruling; or (3)\n       mistakenly based on a crucial assumption that is\n       concededly a non-fact.\n\nId. at 8-9 (quoting Local 1445, United Food & Commercial Workers v.\n\nStop   &   Shop   Cos.,   776   F.2d   19,   21   (1st   Cir.   1985)(internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).        In some of our cases, we have referred\n\nto this non-statutory standard of review as \"manifest disregard of\n\n\n       (1) where the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or\n       undue means;\n       (2) where there was evident partiality or corruption in\n       the arbitrators, or either of them;\n       (3) where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in\n       refusing to postpone the hearing, upon sufficient cause\n       shown, or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and\n       material to the controversy; or of any other misbehavior\n       by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced; or\n       (4) where the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so\n       imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final, and\n       definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not\n       made.\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fthe law.\"   Wonderland Greyhound Park, Inc. v. Autotote Sys., Inc.,\n\n274 F.3d 34, 35 (1st Cir. 2001).6       We have elaborated that we mean\n\nby \"manifest disregard of the law\" a situation \"where it is clear\n\nfrom the record that the arbitrator recognized the applicable law\n\n-- and then ignored it.\"     Advest, 914 F.2d at 9.     To succeed under\n\nthis standard \"there must be some showing in the record, other than\n\nthe   result   obtained,   that   the   arbitrators   knew   the   law   and\n\nexpressly disregarded it.\"        Advest, 914 F.2d at 10 (quoting O.R.\n\nSecurities, Inc. v. Prof'l Planning Assoc., Inc., 857 F.2d 742, 747\n\n(11th Cir. 1988).     \"'[D]isregard' implies that the arbitrators\n\nappreciated the existence of a governing legal rule but wilfully\n\ndecided not to apply it.\"     Id. (emphasis added).7\n\n\n      6\n       In P.R. Tel. Co., Inc. v. U.S. Phone Mfg. Corp., 427 F.3d 21\n(1st Cir. 2005), we stated that \"[u]nder the FAA, an award may be\nvacated for legal error only when in 'manifest disregard of the\nlaw.'\" Id. at 25. Insofar as this statement means that the FAA\ndoes not foreclose extra-statutory judicial review of arbitration\nawards on a limited basis, e.g. the \"manifest disregard of the law\"\nstandard, this statement is correct.     However, insofar as this\nstatement means that the \"manifest disregard of the law standard\"\nis a part of the FAA itself, it would be mistaken. Nowhere in 9\nU.S.C. ยง 10 does the phrase \"manifest disregard of the law\" appear.\nSee Advest, 914 F.2d at 9 n.5 (\"The lane of review that has opened\nout of this language is a judicially created one, not to be found\nin 9 U.S.C. ยง 10.\").\n      7\n       See also Domke, ยง 38:9 (\"Although subject to slight\nvariations in wording, courts generally apply the following two\npart test in determining if the award should be vacated for\nmanifest disregard of the law: (1) Did the arbitrator know of the\ngoverning legal principal yet refused to apply it or ignored it all\ntogether? and (2) Was the law ignored by the arbitrators well\ndefined, explicit and clearly applicable to the case? Only if the\ncourt determines that both prongs of this test are satisfied will\nit overturn an award for manifest disregard of the law.\").\n\n                                    -10-\n\fB.   The district court's reasoning\n\n            On     appeal,    CGMI       maintains      that   the    Second    Panel's\n\nModified Award was improperly vacated under the manifest disregard\n\nof the law standard.               McCarthy, inter alia, asserts that the\n\ndistrict court's Second Remand Order was correct.\n\n            1.     The First Remand Order\n\n            Although not the subject of this appeal, the court's\n\nFirst Remand Order provides a useful insight into its reasoning in\n\nthis case.       As noted above, the First Panel explained the First\n\nAward against McCarthy in these terms:\n\n       While [McCarthy] invoked New Hampshire wage law to\n       support his case, the Panel considered it irrelevant\n       because the Panel considered the case to be a contract\n       dispute regarding an inventive compensation plan commonly\n       used at the firm and commonly used in the securities\n       industry.\n\n(Emphasis       added.)      Focusing      on   the     Panel's   use   of     the   word\n\n\"irrelevant\", the district court concluded that \"the panel set\n\naside the governing law in favor of its perception of an equitable\n\nresult    and    industry     practices.          The   panel's      decision    not    to\n\nconsider the New Hampshire wage laws demonstrates its disregard for\n\nthe governing law.\"          The court saw the First Panel's reasoning as\n\nan   instance      \"where     it    is    clear    from    the    record     that      the\n\narbitrator[s] recognized the applicable law -- and then ignored\n\nit.\"     Advest, 914 F.2d at 9.            Lest there be any doubt about this\n\npoint, the court explained again in the Second Remand Order the\n\nproblem with the First Award: \"In the first award, the panel stated\n\n                                          -11-\n\fthat the New Hampshire wage laws were irrelevant.          As such, the\n\npanel explicitly disregarded the governing law.\" The court's First\n\nRemand Order, given the court's interpretation of the First Award,\n\nwas a conventional application of the manifest disregard of the law\n\nstandard.\n\n            2.    The Second Remand Order\n\n            The    district   court's   application   of   the   manifest\n\ndisregard of the law standard to the Modified Award presents a\n\ndifferent story.     We again quote the reasoning of the Second Panel\n\nin the Modified Award:\n\n     The Panel heard testimony from [McCarthy] and witnesses\n     of both parties and considered documentary evidence from\n     each side as well. The Arbitrators fully considered all\n     claims and defenses, including the applicability of the\n     New Hampshire Wage Laws, which were heavily argued by\n     both sides. After full consideration of the matter, the\n     Panel decided to deny all claims with prejudice.\n\nThe district court focused on the Second Panel's statement that it\n\nhad \"fully considered all claims and defenses, including the\n\napplicability of the New Hampshire Wage Laws,\" and found in that\n\nstatement a troubling ambiguity.          As the court explained in its\n\nSecond Remand Order:\n\n     [t]he [Second] panel did not say whether it concluded\n     that the wage laws were applicable or not applicable or\n     whether it had applied that law in making its decision.\n     Therefore, while the second panel's statement did not\n     clearly demonstrate a manifest disregard of the governing\n     law, as the first panel did, the second panel left open\n     the possibility that, contrary to the court's direction\n     in the [First] remand order, the panel concluded that the\n     New Hampshire wage laws do not apply.\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\f             The       district   court   acknowledged         that   the   mere\n\n\"possibility that . . . the panel concluded that the New Hampshire\n\nwage laws do not apply\" is not itself a manifest disregard of the\n\nlaw.8       As   the   district   court   put   it:   \"[T]he    second   panel's\n\nstatement did not clearly demonstrate a manifest disregard of the\n\ngoverning law, as the first panel did.\"           In the absence of such an\n\nexpression of manifest disregard of the law in the Modified Award\n\nitself, the district court decided to pursue a further inquiry:\n\n        In the first award, the panel stated that the New\n        Hampshire wage laws were irrelevant. As such, the panel\n        explicitly disregarded the governing law so that it was\n        not necessary to look behind that decision to determine\n        its basis.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n             There is authority in our precedents for a court to go\n\nbehind the award of an arbitration panel to the record itself in\n\n\n        8\n      We disagree with the district court that the Modified Award\nof the Second Panel can be read as a possible statement that the\nNew Hampshire wage law is irrelevant, particularly in light of the\nexplicit statement by the Second Panel that it \"fully considered\nall claims and defenses, including the applicability of the New\nHampshire Wage Laws, which were heavily argued by both sides.\" If\nthe court had vacated the award of the Second Panel on this basis\nalone, we would have simply vacated its judgment on this misreading\nof the Modified Award. However, as we explain below, the district\ncourt also identified a second possibility in the Modified Award โ\nnamely, that the Second Panel had applied the New Hampshire wage\nlaw and still found the CAP lawful. In looking behind the award of\nthe Second Panel to determine its basis, the court explained in its\ndecision why this second possibility would also be a manifest\ndisregard of the law. Focusing on that explanation in the balance\nof our opinion, we explain its incompatibility with the narrow\nscope of review that a court must observe in reviewing the decision\nof an arbitration panel.\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fconducting a manifest disregard of the law inquiry.            For example,\n\nwe have said that \"there must be some showing in the record, other\n\nthan the result obtained, that the arbitrators knew the law and\n\nexpressly disregarded it.\"        Advest, 914 F.2d at 10 (emphasis\n\nadded).    But   resorting   to   the   record   in   search   of   manifest\n\ndisregard of the law is constrained by the narrow scope of the\n\nmanifest disregard of the law standard itself. To repeat, manifest\n\ndisregard of the law means, at its core, that \"arbitrators knew the\n\nlaw and explicitly disregarded it.\"         P.R. Tel. Co., 427 F.3d at 32\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).          \"Put differently, disregard\n\nimplies   that   the   arbitrators    appreciated     the   existence   of   a\n\ngoverning legal rule but wilfully decided not to apply it.\"               Id.\n\n(internal citation and quotation marks omitted).\n\n           The manifest disregard of the law inquiry must not run\n\nafoul of the well-established principle that courts \"do not sit to\n\nhear claims of factual or legal error by an arbitrator as an\n\nappellate court does in reviewing decisions of lower courts.\"\n\nUnited Paperworkers Int'l Union v. Misco, Inc., 484 U.S. 29, 38\n\n(1987); see also Poland Spring Corp. v. United Food & Commercial\n\nInt'l Union, 314 F.3d 29, 33 (1st Cir. 2002) (a court does not\n\nconduct appellate review \"to hear claims of factual or legal error\n\nby an arbitrator or to consider the merits of an award\").               \"Even\n\nwhere such error is painfully clear, courts are not authorized to\n\n\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\freconsider the merits of arbitration awards.\"        Advest, 914 F.2d at\n\n8 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n          The district court did not observe this limitation on its\n\nauthority to review an arbitration award.            Instead of finding\n\nmanifest disregard of the law by the Second Panel, it found an\n\napplication   of   the   Wage   Law   with   which   it   disagreed.   To\n\ndemonstrate this point, we quote several excerpts from the court's\n\nSecond Remand Order:\n\n     CGMI's arguments to the arbitration panel, that the CAP\n     was lawful because McCarthy's compensation, paid in cash\n     and restricted stock, conferred a benefit to him, because\n     McCarthy had agreed to participate in the CAP and was a\n     sophisticated and intelligent financial consultant, and\n     because McCarthy had benefitted in the past from the CAP,\n     are not pertinent to the principles of New Hampshire law.\n     Instead, CGMI's argument is based on the reasoning of the\n     Court of Appeals of New York . . . . CGMI represented to\n     the arbitration panel that the New Hampshire wage laws\n     allowed deductions as long as they accrued 'to the\n     benefit of the employee,' . . . that the New Hampshire\n     laws, like the New York law, allowed [such] a deduction\n     . . . .\n\n     [But] under New Hampshire law, unlike New York law, a\n     deduction is not lawful simply because it accrues to the\n     benefit of an employee . . . .\n\n     CGMI also argued that the CAP was a lawful deduction as\n     a payment into a savings fund held by someone other than\n     the employer and that it was empowered by the federal tax\n     treatment of similar plans to offer the CAP . . . .\n     Neither argument is persuasive.\n\n     Nevertheless, it is perhaps arguable that the panel was\n     sufficiently confused or misled by CGMI's arguments to\n     conclude that the CAP deductions comported with New\n     Hampshire law.   Even assuming that the CAP deductions\n     were lawful, however, CGMI did not offer the arbitration\n     panel any justification under New Hampshire law for its\n     failure to pay McCarthy the compensation that he had\n\n                                  -15-\n\f       earned before he resigned. CGMI's oft-repeated theory .\n       . . does not comport with New Hampshire law.\n\n            After this extensive merits review, the district court\n\nconcluded:\n\n       In the absence of any explanation, there appears to be no\n       arguable or plausible basis for the [Second] panel to\n       have ruled either that the New Hampshire wage laws did\n       not apply to McCarthy's claims or that CGMI's failure to\n       pay McCarthy earned compensation, based on the forfeiture\n       provision in the CAP, was lawful. In either case, the\n       panel's decision necessarily was made in manifest\n       disregard of the law.\n\nTo make its meaning unmistakable, the district court added in a\n\nfootnote to its decision that \"[b]ecause neither alternative basis\n\nfor the decision is reasonable, given the governing law, a remand\n\nfor clarification would not be beneficial here.\"                  Therefore, if\n\nthere were to be a third arbitration proceeding, the district court\n\ndirected that a new panel be convened.             In that circumstance, the\n\ncourt said the parties were \"to request that the arbitration panel\n\nprovide   an   explanation    or    reasons   for    its     decision    to   allow\n\nmeaningful judicial review.\"\n\n            Although the district court's legal analysis of the\n\nrelationship between the Wage Law and the CAP Plan was thoughtful\n\n(indeed, the court was thoughtful about this case throughout the\n\nlengthy proceedings), there are several errors in the district\n\ncourt's Second Remand Order.         First, with its insistence that the\n\nnext   arbitration   panel,    if    one    were    constituted,      provide   an\n\nexplanation    or   reasons   for    its    decision    to    allow     meaningful\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fjudicial   review,   the   court   ignored   the    basic   principle   that\n\n\"arbitrators need not explain their award\" at all.          P.R. Tel. Co.,\n\n427 F.3d at 32 (internal citation omitted).           Second, although it\n\ntheoretically left open the possibility that a third arbitration\n\npanel could explain why McCarthy's claim failed under New Hampshire\n\nlaw, the court's elaborate rejection of that possibility in its\n\nSecond Remand Order delivered an unmistakable message to a third\n\npanel -- such a decision would be difficult to justify.             Courts\n\nshould avoid such messages when remanding cases to arbitration\n\npanels. See Domke, ยง 30:6 (\"[C]areful consideration should also be\n\ngiven that remanding the case does not make the court itself decide\n\nthe issue in controversy or instruct the arbitration in such\n\ndirection.\").\n\n           Third, in looking behind the Modified Award, the court\n\ndid not examine the record of proceedings before the panel for\n\nmanifest disregard of the law -- that is, \"some showing in the\n\nrecord, other than the result obtained, that the arbitrators knew\n\nthe law and expressly disregarded it.\"             Advest, 914 F.2d at 10\n\n(internal citation omitted).       Instead, the court conducted its own\n\nanalysis of the compatibility of the CAP Plan with the Wage Law and\n\nconcluded that the Modified Award in favor of CGMI, absent some\n\nfurther explanation, was wrong. Moreover, in conducting that legal\n\nanalysis, the court did not find that \"rare\" instance of manifest\n\ndisregard we described in Advest, where \"the governing law may have\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\fsuch widespread familiarity, pristine clarity, and irrefutable\n\napplicability that a court could assume the arbitrators knew the\n\nrule and, notwithstanding, swept it under the rug.\"            914 F.2d at\n\n10. Instead, the court's analysis reveals a legal landscape devoid\n\nof statutory language or a decision of the New Hampshire Supreme\n\nCourt that irrefutably proscribes the CAP Plan under the Wage Law.\n\nAt most, after a merits analysis of the Modified Award, the\n\ndistrict   court   arguably   found   a   legal   error   in   its   result.\n\nHowever, our precedents forbid a district court from conducting\n\nsuch a review of an arbitration award.        See Poland Spring Corp.,\n\n314 F.3d at 33 (a court does not conduct appellate review \"to hear\n\nclaims of factual or legal error by an arbitrator or to consider\n\nthe merits of an award\").      We must therefore vacate the district\n\ncourt's Second Remand Order and direct the court to enter a\n\njudgment confirming the Second Panel's Modified Award.9 Each party\n\nis to bear its own costs.\n\n           So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n     9\n       Relying on Montes v. Shearson Lehman Bros., Inc., 128 F.3d\n1456 (11th Cir. 1997), where the court found an award in manifest\ndisregard of the law, McCarthy also asserts that CGMI \"undermined\nthe integrity of the Second Hearing\" by \"repeatedly urg[ing] the\nSecond Panel during oral argument to disregard the law,\" and that\nthis conduct constitutes an independent basis for vacating the\nModified Award. The district court rejected that argument: \"the\ncircumstances in this case are not sufficiently similar to those in\nMontes to permit application here of that narrowly limited\ndecision.\" We see no reason to disturb this ruling.\n\n                                  -18-\n\f",

Factual Background\n\n            Plaintiff James W. McCarthy (\"McCarthy\") was a financial\n\nconsultant at Smith Barney, predecessor of Defendant Citigroup\n\nGlobal Markets Inc. (\"CGMI\"), from 1985 until his resignation in\n\nMay 2003.    As of 1993, he worked in the Manchester, New Hampshire\n\noffice of CGMI.   CGMI is an investment bank and brokerage firm with\n\nits principal place of business in New York City.          It is a\n\nsubsidiary of Citigroup Inc., one of the world's largest financial\n\nservices companies.\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\f           While an employee, McCarthy participated in the Capital\n\nAccumulation Plan (\"CAP Plan\"), which was sponsored by CGMI's\n\nparent company, Traveler's Group, Inc.                The CAP Plan is a program\n\ndesigned to retain employees by giving them the opportunity to\n\npurchase restricted shares of Citigroup, either in the form of\n\nCitigroup restricted stock at discounted prices on a tax-deferred\n\nbasis, or as grants of non-qualified stock options for Citigroup\n\ncommon stock.     An eligible employee must sign, at least annually,\n\na form electing to participate in the CAP Plan, wherein the\n\nemployee designates the amount of earnings he wants deducted from\n\nhis paychecks and used in the CAP Plan.\n\n           Under     the    CAP   Plan     restricted        stock   program,    the\n\nrestricted   stock    is    acquired     at     a    twenty-five     percent    (25%)\n\ndiscount from market value and is purchased with wage deductions\n\nfrom payroll checks.        However, the stock purchases are subject to\n\na vesting period of two years.             When the restricted shares vest,\n\nthe participant pays ordinary income taxes and payroll taxes based\n\non the market value of the shares on the vesting date, unless the\n\nparticipant has elected to pay taxes at the time of the payroll\n\ndeduction.      McCarthy had paid income and payroll taxes on many of\n\nthe shares at issue here.             If a participant in the CAP Plan\n\nresigns,   as    McCarthy    did,    the    participant       forfeits    both   the\n\nunvested   restricted       shares   and       the   wages    deducted   from    the\n\npaychecks.       The unvested restricted shares are cancelled, the\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\funderlying restricted Citigroup stock reverts to Citigroup, and\n\nCGMI does not return the wages to the participant.    Under the CAP\n\nPlan stock option program, a participant can choose to receive up\n\nto one-third of the restricted shares in the form of non-qualified\n\nstock options on Citigroup common stock.   If employment terminates\n\nvoluntarily, unvested options may not be exercised.     As with the\n\nrestricted stock program, when an option is exercised, income and\n\npayroll taxes are withheld.\n\n           McCarthy resigned on May 9, 2003.    From 1993 until his\n\nresignation, McCarthy voluntarily elected in writing to direct the\n\nequivalent of 20-25% of his compensation to be invested through the\n\nCAP Plan. He participated mostly in the restricted stock plan, but\n\nat times also purchased stock options under the CAP Plan. McCarthy\n\nsought to recover his contributions to the CAP Plan that had\n\nresulted in the purchase of unvested shares, as well as funds that\n\nhad not been used to purchase shares.   Pursuant to the terms of the\n\nCAP Plan, these contributions had been forfeited.\n\nB.   Procedural Background\n\n           Pursuant to the parties' arbitration agreement and the\n\nregulatory framework of the securities industry, McCarthy commenced\n\narbitration proceedings against CGMI with the National Association\n\nof Securities Dealers (\"NASD\") on December 29, 2003.1      McCarthy\n\n\n      1\n        The NASD is the primary self-regulatory organization\nresponsible for the regulation of persons and companies involved in\nthe securities industry in the United States, with delegated\n\n                               -4-\n\fasserted statutory claims under the New Hampshire wage laws (the\n\n\"Wage Law\") and equitable claims.\n\n          A hearing was held on November 18, 2004 (the \"First\n\nHearing\").   The arbitrators in the First Hearing (the \"First\n\nPanel\") ruled in favor of CGMI and dismissed McCarthy's claims (the\n\n\"First Award\"):2\n\n     [McCarthy's] request for relief is denied. The evidence\n     and documents presented in evidence at the hearing\n     demonstrated that [McCarthy] knowingly and willingly\n     participated in the [CAP Plan] by signing the election\n     forms twice a year for several years.         [McCarthy]\n     benefitted financially from participation in the [CAP\n     Plan] to a substantial degree over the years.       While\n     [McCarthy] invoked New Hampshire wage law to support his\n     case, the Panel considered it irrelevant because the\n     Panel considered the case to be a contract dispute\n     regarding an inventive compensation plan commonly used at\n     the firm and commonly used in the securities industry.\n\nOn December 16, 2004, McCarthy asked the district court to vacate\n\nthe First Award.   CGMI cross-moved to confirm it.   Focusing on the\n\nlanguage above, the district court remanded the matter to the NASD\n\nfor further arbitration proceedings (\"First Remand Order\"):\n\n\n\nauthority from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. See\n\"About NASD\", http://www.nasd.com/AboutNASD/index.htm (last visited\nAugust 15, 2006).\n     2\n       In the context of arbitration, an \"award\" can denote both\nthe decision an arbitration panel reaches and the authenticated\ndocument containing the decision. See 2 Martin Domke, Domke on\nCommercial Arbitration, Appx. B-1 ยง 19(a) (3d. ed. 2003)(\"An\narbitrator shall make a record of an award. The record must be\nsigned or otherwise authenticated by any arbitrator who concurs\nwith the award. The arbitrator or the arbitration organization\nshall give notice of the award, including a copy of the award, to\neach party to the arbitration proceeding.\").\n\n                                -5-\n\f      The [arbitration] panel does not appear to have intended\n      \"irrelevant\" to have its usual meaning.     Instead, the\n      panel concluded that McCarthy was not protected by the\n      wage laws because he had profited from the CAP in the\n      past and had voluntarily agreed to its terms. As such,\n      the panel acknowledged the applicability of the wage laws\n      but decided not to apply them because of the\n      circumstances attending McCarthy's claim. The panel also\n      decided not to consider the wage laws because plans like\n      the CAP are commonly used in the securities industry. In\n      doing so, the panel set aside the governing law in favor\n      of its perception of an equitable result and industry\n      practices. The panel's decision not to consider the New\n      Hampshire wage laws demonstrates its disregard for the\n      governing law.\n\nThe district court concluded that \"the case must be remanded to\n\nhave McCarthy's claim decided under the New Hampshire wage laws\n\nthrough arbitration.\" Although CGMI filed an appeal from the First\n\nRemand Order (the \"First Appeal\"), it never pursued that First\n\nAppeal. Instead, CGMI voluntarily withdrew it. On March 18, 2005,\n\nwe entered a judgment dismissing the First Appeal and sending the\n\ncase back to the district court.\n\n            McCarthy re-filed his claim with the NASD, which convened\n\na second arbitration panel comprised of three new arbitrators (the\n\n\"Second Panel\").     McCarthy withdrew all of his equitable claims,\n\nmoving forward with only his claims based on New Hampshire law.\n\nThe parties submitted briefs to the Second Panel, along with copies\n\nof the Wage Law, case law, the district court's First Remand Order,\n\nthe   CAP   Plan   documents,   and    exhibits   reflecting   McCarthy's\n\nparticipation in the CAP Plan. The Second Panel heard argument and\n\ntestimony from several witnesses on August 2, 2005 (the \"Second\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fHearing\").       CGMI argued that the CAP Plan did not violate the Wage\n\nLaw and, in the alternative, that McCarthy was not entitled to any\n\ndamages regardless of the status of the CAP Plan under the Wage\n\nLaw.3       McCarthy asserted that the First Remand Order required the\n\nSecond Panel to apply the Wage Law to his claims, and under the\n\nWage Law the CAP Plan was illegal.         On August 18, 2005, the Second\n\nPanel issued its award denying McCarthy's claims with prejudice\n\n(the \"Modified Award\"):\n\n        [McCarthy] requested that the panel . . . declare that\n        the CAP Plan is illegal under New Hampshire law, to the\n        extent the CAP Plan is implemented (i) through wage\n        deductions, which are not actually used to purchase stock\n        in Citigroup, or (ii) so as to cause employees to forfeit\n        wages.\n\n        . . .\n\n        The Panel heard testimony from [McCarthy] and witnesses\n        of both parties and considered the documentary evidence\n        from each side as well. The Arbitrators fully considered\n        all claims and defenses, including the applicability of\n        the New Hampshire Wage Laws, which were heavily argued on\n        both sides . . . .     After full consideration of the\n        matter, the panel decided to deny all claims with\n        prejudice.\n\n                On September 8, 2005, McCarthy filed with the district\n\ncourt a motion to vacate the Modified Award, asserting again that\n\nthe     arbitrators    had   manifestly    disregarded   controlling   law.\n\nMcCarthy also claimed that the award should be vacated because CGMI\n\n\n        3\n       CGMI asserted that \"McCarthy is not entitled to any damages\nbecause, if he held all his vested shares, McCarthy netted over one\nmillion dollars from voluntarily participating in the CAP Plan, and\nCGMI is entitled to recover those shares or their market value in\nexcess of McCarthy's cost of any unvested stock.\"\n\n                                     -7-\n\fimproperly     encouraged      the    arbitrators    to     ignore   the     district\n\ncourt's legal findings as they were set forth in the First Remand\n\nOrder, and because the arbitrators refused to be polled as to\n\nwhether they would follow the law. CGMI again filed a cross-motion\n\nfor confirmation of the award.\n\n             In a Second Remand Order dated December 15, 2005, the\n\ndistrict     court   vacated    the    Modified     Award    because    it    was   in\n\nmanifest disregard of the law, denied CGMI's cross-motion for\n\nconfirmation of the award, and remanded the case for a third\n\narbitration proceeding, if necessary (the court urged the parties\n\nto settle).4\n\n                                        II.\n\nA.

The district court's reasoning\n\n            On     appeal,    CGMI       maintains      that   the    Second    Panel's\n\nModified Award was improperly vacated under the manifest disregard\n\nof the law standard.               McCarthy, inter alia, asserts that the\n\ndistrict court's Second Remand Order was correct.\n\n            1.     The First Remand Order\n\n            Although not the subject of this appeal, the court's\n\nFirst Remand Order provides a useful insight into its reasoning in\n\nthis case.       As noted above, the First Panel explained the First\n\nAward against McCarthy in these terms:\n\n       While [McCarthy] invoked New Hampshire wage law to\n       support his case, the Panel considered it irrelevant\n       because the Panel considered the case to be a contract\n       dispute regarding an inventive compensation plan commonly\n       used at the firm and commonly used in the securities\n       industry.\n\n(Emphasis       added.)      Focusing      on   the     Panel's   use   of     the   word\n\n\"irrelevant\", the district court concluded that \"the panel set\n\naside the governing law in favor of its perception of an equitable\n\nresult    and    industry     practices.          The   panel's      decision    not    to\n\nconsider the New Hampshire wage laws demonstrates its disregard for\n\nthe governing law.\"          The court saw the First Panel's reasoning as\n\nan   instance      \"where     it    is    clear    from    the    record     that      the\n\narbitrator[s] recognized the applicable law -- and then ignored\n\nit.\"     Advest, 914 F.2d at 9.            Lest there be any doubt about this\n\npoint, the court explained again in the Second Remand Order the\n\nproblem with the First Award: \"In the first award, the panel stated\n\n                                          -11-\n\fthat the New Hampshire wage laws were irrelevant.          As such, the\n\npanel explicitly disregarded the governing law.\" The court's First\n\nRemand Order, given the court's interpretation of the First Award,\n\nwas a conventional application of the manifest disregard of the law\n\nstandard.\n\n            2.    The Second Remand Order\n\n            The    district   court's   application   of   the   manifest\n\ndisregard of the law standard to the Modified Award presents a\n\ndifferent story.     We again quote the reasoning of the Second Panel\n\nin the Modified Award:\n\n     The Panel heard testimony from [McCarthy] and witnesses\n     of both parties and considered documentary evidence from\n     each side as well. The Arbitrators fully considered all\n     claims and defenses, including the applicability of the\n     New Hampshire Wage Laws, which were heavily argued by\n     both sides. After full consideration of the matter, the\n     Panel decided to deny all claims with prejudice.\n\nThe district court focused on the Second Panel's statement that it\n\nhad \"fully considered all claims and defenses, including the\n\napplicability of the New Hampshire Wage Laws,\" and found in that\n\nstatement a troubling ambiguity.          As the court explained in its\n\nSecond Remand Order:\n\n     [t]he [Second] panel did not say whether it concluded\n     that the wage laws were applicable or not applicable or\n     whether it had applied that law in making its decision.\n     Therefore, while the second panel's statement did not\n     clearly demonstrate a manifest disregard of the governing\n     law, as the first panel did, the second panel left open\n     the possibility that, contrary to the court's direction\n     in the [First] remand order, the panel concluded that the\n     New Hampshire wage laws do not apply.\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\f             The       district   court   acknowledged         that   the   mere\n\n\"possibility that . . . the panel concluded that the New Hampshire\n\nwage laws do not apply\" is not itself a manifest disregard of the\n\nlaw.8       As   the   district   court   put   it:   \"[T]he    second   panel's\n\nstatement did not clearly demonstrate a manifest disregard of the\n\ngoverning law, as the first panel did.\"           In the absence of such an\n\nexpression of manifest disregard of the law in the Modified Award\n\nitself, the district court decided to pursue a further inquiry:\n\n        In the first award, the panel stated that the New\n        Hampshire wage laws were irrelevant. As such, the panel\n        explicitly disregarded the governing law so that it was\n        not necessary to look behind that decision to determine\n        its basis.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n             There is authority in our precedents for a court to go\n\nbehind the award of an arbitration panel to the record itself in\n\n\n        8\n      We disagree with the district court that the Modified Award\nof the Second Panel can be read as a possible statement that the\nNew Hampshire wage law is irrelevant, particularly in light of the\nexplicit statement by the Second Panel that it \"fully considered\nall claims and defenses, including the applicability of the New\nHampshire Wage Laws, which were heavily argued by both sides.\" If\nthe court had vacated the award of the Second Panel on this basis\nalone, we would have simply vacated its judgment on this misreading\nof the Modified Award. However, as we explain below, the district\ncourt also identified a second possibility in the Modified Award โ\nnamely, that the Second Panel had applied the New Hampshire wage\nlaw and still found the CAP lawful. In looking behind the award of\nthe Second Panel to determine its basis, the court explained in its\ndecision why this second possibility would also be a manifest\ndisregard of the law. Focusing on that explanation in the balance\nof our opinion, we explain its incompatibility with the narrow\nscope of review that a court must observe in reviewing the decision\nof an arbitration panel.\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fconducting a manifest disregard of the law inquiry.            For example,\n\nwe have said that \"there must be some showing in the record, other\n\nthan the result obtained, that the arbitrators knew the law and\n\nexpressly disregarded it.\"        Advest, 914 F.2d at 10 (emphasis\n\nadded).    But   resorting   to   the   record   in   search   of   manifest\n\ndisregard of the law is constrained by the narrow scope of the\n\nmanifest disregard of the law standard itself. To repeat, manifest\n\ndisregard of the law means, at its core, that \"arbitrators knew the\n\nlaw and explicitly disregarded it.\"         P.R. Tel. Co., 427 F.3d at 32\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).          \"Put differently, disregard\n\nimplies   that   the   arbitrators    appreciated     the   existence   of   a\n\ngoverning legal rule but wilfully decided not to apply it.\"               Id.\n\n(internal citation and quotation marks omitted).\n\n           The manifest disregard of the law inquiry must not run\n\nafoul of the well-established principle that courts \"do not sit to\n\nhear claims of factual or legal error by an arbitrator as an\n\nappellate court does in reviewing decisions of lower courts.\"\n\nUnited Paperworkers Int'l Union v.

Instead of finding\n\nmanifest disregard of the law by the Second Panel, it found an\n\napplication   of   the   Wage   Law   with   which   it   disagreed.   To\n\ndemonstrate this point, we quote several excerpts from the court's\n\nSecond Remand Order:\n\n     CGMI's arguments to the arbitration panel, that the CAP\n     was lawful because McCarthy's compensation, paid in cash\n     and restricted stock, conferred a benefit to him, because\n     McCarthy had agreed to participate in the CAP and was a\n     sophisticated and intelligent financial consultant, and\n     because McCarthy had benefitted in the past from the CAP,\n     are not pertinent to the principles of New Hampshire law.\n     Instead, CGMI's argument is based on the reasoning of the\n     Court of Appeals of New York . . . . CGMI represented to\n     the arbitration panel that the New Hampshire wage laws\n     allowed deductions as long as they accrued 'to the\n     benefit of the employee,' . . . that the New Hampshire\n     laws, like the New York law, allowed [such] a deduction\n     . . . .\n\n     [But] under New Hampshire law, unlike New York law, a\n     deduction is not lawful simply because it accrues to the\n     benefit of an employee . . . .\n\n     CGMI also argued that the CAP was a lawful deduction as\n     a payment into a savings fund held by someone other than\n     the employer and that it was empowered by the federal tax\n     treatment of similar plans to offer the CAP . . . .\n     Neither argument is persuasive.\n\n     Nevertheless, it is perhaps arguable that the panel was\n     sufficiently confused or misled by CGMI's arguments to\n     conclude that the CAP deductions comported with New\n     Hampshire law.   Even assuming that the CAP deductions\n     were lawful, however, CGMI did not offer the arbitration\n     panel any justification under New Hampshire law for its\n     failure to pay McCarthy the compensation that he had\n\n                                  -15-\n\f       earned before he resigned. CGMI's oft-repeated theory .\n       . . does not comport with New Hampshire law.\n\n            After this extensive merits review, the district court\n\nconcluded:\n\n       In the absence of any explanation, there appears to be no\n       arguable or plausible basis for the [Second] panel to\n       have ruled either that the New Hampshire wage laws did\n       not apply to McCarthy's claims or that CGMI's failure to\n       pay McCarthy earned compensation, based on the forfeiture\n       provision in the CAP, was lawful. In either case, the\n       panel's decision necessarily was made in manifest\n       disregard of the law.\n\nTo make its meaning unmistakable, the district court added in a\n\nfootnote to its decision that \"[b]ecause neither alternative basis\n\nfor the decision is reasonable, given the governing law, a remand\n\nfor clarification would not be beneficial here.\"                  Therefore, if\n\nthere were to be a third arbitration proceeding, the district court\n\ndirected that a new panel be convened.             In that circumstance, the\n\ncourt said the parties were \"to request that the arbitration panel\n\nprovide   an   explanation    or    reasons   for    its     decision    to   allow\n\nmeaningful judicial review.\"\n\n            Although the district court's legal analysis of the\n\nrelationship between the Wage Law and the CAP Plan was thoughtful\n\n(indeed, the court was thoughtful about this case throughout the\n\nlengthy proceedings), there are several errors in the district\n\ncourt's Second Remand Order.         First, with its insistence that the\n\nnext   arbitration   panel,    if    one    were    constituted,      provide   an\n\nexplanation    or   reasons   for    its    decision    to    allow     meaningful\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fjudicial   review,   the   court   ignored   the    basic   principle   that\n\n\"arbitrators need not explain their award\" at all.          P.R. Tel. Co.,\n\n427 F.3d at 32 (internal citation omitted).           Second, although it\n\ntheoretically left open the possibility that a third arbitration\n\npanel could explain why McCarthy's claim failed under New Hampshire\n\nlaw, the court's elaborate rejection of that possibility in its\n\nSecond Remand Order delivered an unmistakable message to a third\n\npanel -- such a decision would be difficult to justify.             Courts\n\nshould avoid such messages when remanding cases to arbitration\n\npanels. See Domke, ยง 30:6 (\"[C]areful consideration should also be\n\ngiven that remanding the case does not make the court itself decide\n\nthe issue in controversy or instruct the arbitration in such\n\ndirection.\").\n\n           Third, in looking behind the Modified Award, the court\n\ndid not examine the record of proceedings before the panel for\n\nmanifest disregard of the law -- that is, \"some showing in the\n\nrecord, other than the result obtained, that the arbitrators knew\n\nthe law and expressly disregarded it.\"             Advest, 914 F.2d at 10\n\n(internal citation omitted).       Instead, the court conducted its own\n\nanalysis of the compatibility of the CAP Plan with the Wage Law and\n\nconcluded that the Modified Award in favor of CGMI, absent some\n\nfurther explanation, was wrong. Moreover, in conducting that legal\n\nanalysis, the court did not find that \"rare\" instance of manifest\n\ndisregard we described in Advest, where \"the governing law may have\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\fsuch widespread familiarity, pristine clarity, and irrefutable\n\napplicability that a court could assume the arbitrators knew the\n\nrule and, notwithstanding, swept it under the rug.\"            914 F.2d at\n\n10. Instead, the court's analysis reveals a legal landscape devoid\n\nof statutory language or a decision of the New Hampshire Supreme\n\nCourt that irrefutably proscribes the CAP Plan under the Wage Law.\n\nAt most, after a merits analysis of the Modified Award, the\n\ndistrict   court   arguably   found   a   legal   error   in   its   result.\n\nHowever, our precedents forbid a district court from conducting\n\nsuch a review of an arbitration award.        See Poland Spring Corp.,\n\n314 F.3d at 33 (a court does not conduct appellate review \"to hear\n\nclaims of factual or legal error by an arbitrator or to consider\n\nthe merits of an award\").      We must therefore vacate the district\n\ncourt's Second Remand Order and direct the court to enter a\n\njudgment confirming the Second Panel's Modified Award.9 Each party\n\nis to bear its own costs.\n\n           So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n     9\n       Relying on Montes v.
