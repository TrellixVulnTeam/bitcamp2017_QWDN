App. P. 43(c)(2), Attorney General\nEric H. Holder, Jr. has been substituted for former Attorney\nGeneral Michael B. Mukasey as the respondent.\n\f          LYNCH, Chief Judge.    Gentian Muska, a native and citizen\n\nof Albania, petitions for review of an August 13, 2008 decision by\n\nthe Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") adopting the findings of\n\nthe Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") and issuing a final order of removal.\n\nWe deny his petition in part and dismiss it in part.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          Gentian Muska arrived in the United States on October 16,\n\n1999 with a valid B-2 visa obtained from the United States Embassy\n\nin Greece.   As of April 16, 2000, he overstayed his visa.   Over a\n\nyear later, on July 23, 2001, Muska filed an application for\n\nasylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention\n\nAgainst Torture (\"CAT\") with the Immigration and Naturalization\n\nService (\"INS\").    INS did not grant this application and Muska was\n\nreferred to an Immigration Court for removal proceedings where, on\n\nApril 24, 2002, he conceded removability but also renewed his\n\napplication for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection\n\nunder the CAT.     He filed a new application with the Immigration\n\nCourt on June 16, 2005.\n\n          At the March 3, 2006 hearing on the merits of his claims,\n\nMuska withdrew his asylum application because it was untimely, but\n\npresented evidence to support his other claims.     After reviewing\n\nthe evidence, the IJ denied the claims.\n\n          The IJ found Muska \"not credible with regard to key\n\nelements of his claim.\"    Even assuming credibility, the IJ found\n\n                                 -2-\n\fthat Muska had not met his burden to receive withholding of removal\n\nby showing past persecution by the government or individuals or\n\norganizations controlled by the government.           Specifically, the IJ\n\nconcluded that a 1997 attack by unidentified persons on Muska's\n\nfamily home, which caused him and his family to flee the country,\n\nand a 1999 fight Muska participated in at a café while on a brief\n\nvisit to Albania from Greece, purportedly instigated by Socialists\n\nbecause of his political affiliation with Albania's Democratic\n\nParty, did not constitute persecution.          The IJ also concluded that\n\nMuska's account of the 1999 café incident as well as his testimony\n\nthat he was sure he would be persecuted by unidentified groups was\n\ninsufficient      to   establish    a      well-founded      fear   of   future\n\npersecution.      In doing so, the IJ took notice of a 2004 State\n\nDepartment report describing a more stable political environment in\n\nAlbania and reporting that the Democratic Party at that time\n\ncontrolled the executive branch of the Albanian government. The IJ\n\nalso   rejected   Muska's   CAT    claim,    noting   that    \"[t]here   is   no\n\nevidence in the record of proceedings nor any presented at the\n\nhearing on the merits to suggest that the respondent has any reason\n\nto fear torture.\"       Finally, the IJ rejected an application for\n\nvoluntary departure because Muska expressed a reluctance to leave\n\nthe country, even if ordered to do so.\n\n           On September 29, 2006, Muska filed a notice of appeal\n\nwith the BIA. In an opinion dated August 13, 2008, the BIA affirmed\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fthe IJ's decision. The BIA found no clear error in the IJ's finding\n\nthat Muska was not credible, and noted that Muska's brief failed to\n\naddress the specific inconsistencies identified by the IJ.                 The BIA\n\nalso   agreed   with   the    IJ's     alternate     conclusion    that    even      if\n\ncredible, Muska could not receive withholding of removal because he\n\nfailed to establish either past persecution or a clear probability\n\nof future persecution by the Albanian government.                  It noted that\n\nMuska had failed to cite any legal authority that might suggest that\n\nthe 1997 and 1999 incidents were sufficient evidence to meet his\n\nburden, and that the brief did not address the IJ's findings with\n\nregard to changes in the Albanian government after 1997.                   The BIA\n\nrejected Muska's claim for relief under the CAT and request for\n\nvoluntary departure, because his brief presented no substantive\n\narguments on either issue.\n\n            Muska filed a petition for review with this court.\n\n                                        II.\n\n            Where,     as    here,   the   BIA     adopts   or    defers   to       the\n\nImmigration     Court's     findings    and   also    discusses     some       of   the\n\nunderlying bases for the decision, we review the decisions of both\n\nthe BIA and the IJ.         Zheng v. Gonzales, 475 F.3d 30, 33 (1st Cir.\n\n2007).\n\n            We review agency findings of fact under the deferential\n\n\"substantial evidence\" standard.           Sinurat v. Mukasey, 537 F.3d 59,\n\n61   (1st   Cir.   2008).       This    standard     requires     that    we    treat\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fadministrative findings of fact as \"conclusive unless any reasonable\n\nadjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\"         8\n\nU.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B).    To revise the agency's findings, \"we must\n\nbe persuaded that 'the evidence not only supports that conclusion,\n\nbut compels it.'\" Khem v. Ashcroft, 342 F.3d 51, 53 (1st Cir. 2003)\n\n(quoting INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 n.1 (1992)).\n\nA.           Withholding of Removal\n\n             The BIA's denial of withholding of removal is supported\n\nby record evidence both that Muska's testimony was not credible and\n\nthat, even if the testimony were deemed credible, it failed to meet\n\nthe burden for withholding of removal.     These two independent bases\n\nlead to denial of the petition as to the withholding claim.\n\n             In his petition before this court, Muska has not briefed\n\nthe credibility issue and so any challenge to the IJ's findings is\n\nwaived.   Tower v. Leslie-Brown, 326 F.3d 290, 299 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\nThat alone would require us to deny the petition.       But we go on to\n\naffirm the BIA's alternate holding.\n\n             In order to obtain withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1231(b)(3), the applicant has the burden of proving that \"his or\n\nher life or freedom would be threatened in the proposed country of\n\nremoval on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a\n\nparticular    social   group,   or   political   opinion.\"   8   C.F.R.\n\n§ 1208.16(b).    To meet this standard, an applicant must show that\n\nit \"is more likely than not\" that he or she would suffer persecution\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fif removed.   8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(2); De Oliveira v. Mukasey, 520\n\nF.3d 78, 79 (1st Cir. 2008). However, an applicant is also entitled\n\nto a rebuttable presumption of future persecution if he or she can\n\ndemonstrate   past   persecution   on    protected   grounds.   8   C.F.R.\n\n§ 1208.16(b)(1); Orelien v. Gonzales, 467 F.3d 67, 71 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).\n\n           Muska's argument that he has experienced past persecution\n\nwas based on the 1997 attack on his home and the 1999 café incident.\n\nTestifying about the 1997 attack before the IJ, Muska suggested that\n\nthe attack was retribution for a decision by his father, at that\n\ntime a colonel in the Albanian military, to disobey orders to fire\n\non \"innocent people.\"    Yet as the IJ and BIA noted, Muska could not\n\nidentify the culprits, he provided only vague suggestions of their\n\npossible motives, and in any case, the events occurred during a time\n\nof general unrest.\n\n           Regarding the 1999 café fight, Muska also provided vague\n\ndetails as to the identity of his attackers and their motives for\n\nattacking him.   He described them as \"Socialist people\" and said\n\nthat they approached him because they knew his father and that Muska\n\nwas a member of the Democratic Party.          This evidence    does not\n\ncompel the conclusion that these two incidents either together or\n\nin isolation amounted to persecution.\n\n           The record also does not compel a finding that Muska\n\nwould more likely than not experience persecution if he returned to\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fAlbania.   The 1999 café incident does not by itself compel the\n\nconclusion that he would suffer persecution if he remained in the\n\ncountry.   Muska also testified that if he returned home he was sure\n\nthat he would be persecuted for his membership in the Democratic\n\nParty and for his father's role as a colonel in the military.   Yet\n\nhe could not explain who would be doing this and why.    When asked\n\nwhy he felt he would still be unsafe, given that the Democratic\n\nParty at the time of the hearing controlled the Executive branch of\n\nthe Albanian government, Muska responded that the local governments\n\nwere still controlled by the Socialists, but did not explain why\n\nthey posed a danger.    Given the limited nature of Muska's evidence\n\nand the fact that the 2004 State Department report stated that the\n\npolitical situation had stabilized in Albania, substantial evidence\n\nsupported the IJ's finding that Muska did not more likely than not\n\nface persecution if removed.      Since Muska did not address the\n\nevidence regarding changes in the Albanian government in his appeal\n\nto the BIA, its decision was also supported by substantial evidence.\n\nB.         CAT and Voluntary Departure Claims\n\n           Muska's claims for CAT relief and voluntary departure\n\nwere not substantially argued to the BIA.   Because he has failed to\n\nexhaust his administrative remedies we do not have jurisdiction to\n\nhear these claims.     Silva v. Gonzales, 463 F.3d 68, 72 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f                               III.\n\n           We have dealt with the merits of the case, but we wish to\n\nnote that petitioner's brief was inadequate and we could have\n\ndecided the case on the basis of abandonment or waiver.   The brief\n\ncontained only a page and a half of discussion and presented Muska's\n\nclaims unclearly.   Counsel is warned that this is unacceptable.\n\n           For the foregoing reasons, the petition is denied in part\n\nand dismissed in part.\n\n\n\n\n                                -8-\n\f",

However, an applicant is also entitled\n\nto a rebuttable presumption of future persecution if he or she can\n\ndemonstrate   past   persecution   on    protected   grounds.   8   C.F.R.\n\n§ 1208.16(b)(1); Orelien v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 71 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).\n\n           Muska's argument that he has experienced past persecution\n\nwas based on the 1997 attack on his home and the 1999 café incident.\n\nTestifying about the 1997 attack before the IJ, Muska suggested that\n\nthe attack was retribution for a decision by his father, at that\n\ntime a colonel in the Albanian military, to disobey orders to fire\n\non \"innocent people.\"    Yet as the IJ and BIA noted, Muska could not\n\nidentify the culprits, he provided only vague suggestions of their\n\npossible motives, and in any case, the events occurred during a time\n\nof general unrest.\n\n           Regarding the 1999 café fight, Muska also provided vague\n\ndetails as to the identity of his attackers and their motives for\n\nattacking him.   He described them as \"Socialist people\" and said\n\nthat they approached him because they knew his father and that Muska\n\nwas a member of the Democratic Party.          This evidence    does not\n\ncompel the conclusion that these two incidents either together or\n\nin isolation amounted to persecution.\n\n           The record also does not compel a finding that Muska\n\nwould more likely than not experience persecution if he returned to\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fAlbania.   The 1999 café incident does not by itself compel the\n\nconclusion that he would suffer persecution if he remained in the\n\ncountry.   Muska also testified that if he returned home he was sure\n\nthat he would be persecuted for his membership in the Democratic\n\nParty and for his father's role as a colonel in the military.   Yet\n\nhe could not explain who would be doing this and why.    When asked\n\nwhy he felt he would still be unsafe, given that the Democratic\n\nParty at the time of the hearing controlled the Executive branch of\n\nthe Albanian government, Muska responded that the local governments\n\nwere still controlled by the Socialists, but did not explain why\n\nthey posed a danger.    Given the limited nature of Muska's evidence\n\nand the fact that the 2004 State Department report stated that the\n\npolitical situation had stabilized in Albania, substantial evidence\n\nsupported the IJ's finding that Muska did not more likely than not\n\nface persecution if removed.      Since Muska did not address the\n\nevidence regarding changes in the Albanian government in his appeal\n\nto the BIA, its decision was also supported by substantial evidence.\n\nB.         CAT and Voluntary Departure Claims\n\n           Muska's claims for CAT relief and voluntary departure\n\nwere not substantially argued to the BIA.   Because he has failed to\n\nexhaust his administrative remedies we do not have jurisdiction to\n\nhear these claims.     Silva v.

The brief\n\ncontained only a page and a half of discussion and presented Muska's\n\nclaims unclearly.   Counsel is warned that this is unacceptable.\n\n           For the foregoing reasons, the petition is denied in part\n\nand dismissed in part.\n\n\n\n\n                                -8-\n\f</pre>",
