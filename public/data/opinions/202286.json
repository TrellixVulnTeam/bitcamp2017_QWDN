R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                        For the First Circuit\n\nNos. 05-1485\n     06-1209\n                      RICHARD DUHAIME, ET AL.,\n\n                              Plaintiffs,\n                         ____________________\n\n                            THOMAS W.

Richard G. Stearns, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                        Boudin, Chief Judge,\n               Torruella and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Thomas W. Olick on brief pro se.\n     Edwin G. Schallert and Debevoise & Plimpton LLP on brief for\nappellees.\n\n\n                              June 28, 2006\n\f           Per Curiam.      After pursuing an earlier appeal in this\n\ncourt, Olick v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., 2004 WL 1563260\n\n(1st Cir. 2004) (per curiam), and initiating further district court\n\nproceedings,    appellant    Olick    again   seeks   appellate   review.\n\nAssuming familiarity with our prior opinion, we affirm the orders\n\nin question substantially for the reasons recited by the district\n\ncourt, adding only the following comments.\n\n           First.   In No. 05-1485, appellee John Hancock suggests\n\nthat our review does not encompass the November 30, 2004 ruling,\n\nbut is instead confined to the February 28, 2005 order denying Rule\n\n59(e) relief.   Although Olick sought to file a separate notice of\n\nappeal from each order, the first one was not accepted for filing,\n\nfor reasons that he now challenges.           If it were true, as Olick\n\nasserts, that the first notice of appeal was rejected simply\n\nbecause it was unaccompanied by the required filing fee or because\n\nit listed the wrong “session identification” at the end of the case\n\nnumber, his challenge would have potential merit.        But we need not\n\nexplore these issues.       Olick’s intent being clear, and Hancock\n\nhaving suffered no prejudice, we conclude that the notice of appeal\n\nfiled on March 21, 2005 sufficed to appeal from both orders.        See,\n\ne.g., Marie v. Allied Home Mtg. Corp., 402 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).   The challenge to the court’s refusal to extend the time to\n\npay the filing fee is thus moot.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f           Second.    In No. 05-1485, just like in the prior appeal,\n\nOlick advances two basic complaints: (1) as to the four policies,\n\nhe charges that Hancock has not made settlement offers that comply\n\nwith the arbitrator’s decision; and (2) as to the seven policies,\n\nhe charges that Hancock improperly excluded them from the ADR\n\nprocess entirely.     Both arguments stumble right out of the gate.\n\nAs he now acknowledges, Olick has relied on the wrong version of\n\nthe settlement agreement–-the original version filed in June 1997,\n\nrather than the amended version filed in October 1997. He attempts\n\nto shift the blame for this oversight, complaining that neither\n\nHancock nor the court advised him of or provided him with the\n\namended agreement.    Yet Olick had constructive notice thereof; the\n\namended agreement was listed on the docket, for example, and was\n\nprominently mentioned in the district court’s opinion adopting\n\nsame.   See Duhaime v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., 177 F.R.D.\n\n54, 59, 62, 73 (D. Mass. 1997).         An affirmance here would be\n\npermissible on this basis alone.\n\n           Third.    Olick’s claims with respect to the four policies\n\nalso falter on other grounds.      We agree with the district court\n\nthat Olick “has failed to demonstrate in any comprehensible fashion\n\nthat the Hancock offer[s] indeed deviate[] from the arbitrator’s\n\naward.”   Moreover, Olick’s arguments in this regard come too late.\n\nPrior to the first appeal, the district court denied his motion to\n\ncompel without prejudice to his making a showing of noncompliance\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fwith the arbitrator’s decision.            Olick sought reconsideration but\n\nattempted      no    such    showing,    and   on    appeal    we     dismissed    the\n\nallegations of noncompliance as “unsupported.”                      Back before the\n\ndistrict court, he stated that this court had “directed” him “to\n\nfile proof” as to why Hancock’s offers were insufficient; our\n\nopinion contained no such directive.                 And we find nothing in the\n\nallegations now advanced that could not have been raised earlier.\n\n            Fourth.         In a separate argument concerning one of these\n\nfour policies, Olick complains that Hancock has made no settlement\n\noffer at all.       He faults Hancock and the district court for “simply\n\nignor[ing]” this allegation, but it is he who is in default.                        He\n\ndid   not   raise      this     matter   in    his    August       2003   motion   for\n\nreconsideration (after receiving Hancock’s offers), nor on appeal\n\n(voicing no objection to our statement that offers on “each of the\n\nfour” claims had been made), nor in the ensuing motion to compel\n\ncompliance.         The first reference to the lack of such an offer\n\nappeared in the memo accompanying that motion, but no specific\n\ncomplaint was voiced in this regard.                 Thereafter, neither in his\n\nmotion   for    preliminary       determination       nor     in    his   motion   for\n\nsanctions did Olick raise the issue.                 Understandably, therefore,\n\nthe court did not discuss it in its November 30, 2004 decision.\n\nNot until the memo accompanying his motion for reconsideration did\n\nOlick explicitly raise an objection about the lack of an offer.\n\nWhile we do not know if the charge is true (the record on appeal\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fneither   confirms   nor   refutes    it),   Olick   has   forfeited   his\n\nopportunity for judicial review thereof.             See, e.g., Venegas-\n\nHernandez v. Sonolux Records, 370 F.3d 183, 189-90 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(noting “usual rule that parties cannot use Rule 59(e) motions to\n\nraise new arguments that could have been made before judgment\n\nissued or to undo their own procedural failures”).\n\n           Fifth.    The claims involving the seven policies were\n\nexcluded from the ADR process on claim-preclusion grounds, inasmuch\n\nas claims involving those same policies had been the subject of a\n\n1995 NASD arbitration award.          In Olick’s view, the preclusive\n\neffect of the prior arbitration was itself an issue for the\n\narbitrator.   He relies on three main arguments.        He first asserts\n\nthat determining arbitrability here is essentially equivalent to\n\ndetermining class membership: once the latter is established, all\n\nfurther disputes must go to arbitration.       This argument sweeps too\n\nbroadly, for it would deem arbitrable various disputes that have\n\ngenerally been held to be matters for the court.        See, e.g., Marie,\n\n402 F.3d at 11-15 (whether litigation-related activity amounts to\n\nwaiver of arbitration); John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Olick,\n\n151 F.3d 132, 137-39 (3d Cir. 1998) (preclusive effect of prior\n\ncourt judgment).\n\n           Olick also contends that the claim-preclusion issue is a\n\nquestion of “eligibility” to participate in the ADR process, which\n\nmeans that, like all such questions, it is to be resolved in the\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fsame manner as substantive claims for relief–-i.e., first by the\n\nCRT and then if necessary by the arbitrator.               Whether or not\n\nOlick’s characterization is correct, this argument is flawed; all\n\neligibility questions are not resolved in that fashion, as a glance\n\nat the “preliminary review” provisions makes clear.\n\n           Finally,     Olick   alleges    that   two   provisions   of   the\n\nsettlement specifically contemplate that claim-preclusion issues\n\nwould be handled by the arbitrator.         The first calls for an award\n\nto be “offset” by any “prior relief” received by a claimant.              Yet\n\nclaim preclusion is not an “offset” mechanism.          And this provision\n\nrefers to “complaint[s] filed with” Hancock, which is not the\n\nsituation here. The second provides that, absent a written request\n\nfor exclusion, a class member would be bound by the settlement\n\ndespite having “previously initiated ... individual litigation.”\n\nThe context makes clear that this refers to pending actions.\n\n           Moreover, the latter two arguments were untimely, having\n\nfirst   surfaced   in   Olick’s   motion    for   reconsideration.        Such\n\ntardiness is especially notable given the earlier round of district\n\ncourt proceedings and our suggestion that Olick might again be able\n\nto raise the matter upon the filing of a “proper” motion.\n\n           Sixth. One of these seven claims made it through the CRT\n\nstage, only to be deemed ineligible prior to arbitration.            Noting\n\nthat all CRT decisions are binding on Hancock (with exceptions not\n\nhere relevant), Olick argues that Hancock was obligated to accept\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fthe CRT’s implicit finding of eligibility.           Yet, as mentioned\n\nabove, all eligibility questions are not submitted to the CRT, and\n\nOlick has provided no reason to think that the CRT actually\n\nconsidered that issue here.\n\n           Seventh. As to the merits of the claim-preclusion issue,\n\nOlick does not argue that the 1995 NASD award was entirely lacking\n\nin preclusive effect, and properly so.      See Olick, 151 F.3d at 140\n\n(noting “parties’ intentional adherence to a binding principle of\n\nfinality similar to res judicata as applied to arbitration awards\n\nrendered by the NASD”).    Instead, he advances various reasons--\n\noften, again, in untimely fashion--why claim preclusion should not\n\napply here.    Each proves unavailing.       He asserts, with little\n\nelaboration, that the NASD claims and the class claims involved\n\ndifferent matters entirely.     Yet a review of the available NASD\n\nmaterials (complaint, brief and ruling) demonstrates some overlap\n\nbetween the two sets of claims.    Indeed, the degree of overlap may\n\nbe higher than first appears; the record contains a June 4, 1998\n\naffidavit from Olick, submitted in connection with the class suit,\n\nwhich focuses on a key issue involved in the NASD arbitration\n\n(alleged   misrepresentations   that    mortality   costs   would   remain\n\nconstant).\n\n           Olick also contends that his class claims could not have\n\nbeen pursued in the NASD arbitration because they relied in part on\n\nnewly discovered evidence, some of which had been concealed by\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fHancock.      Yet he offers no description of such evidence.                         He\n\ncontends that NASD rules forbid arbitration of disputes involving\n\nlife insurance policies, but he took the opposite position before\n\nthe NASD, with obvious success.                And he emphasizes his pro se\n\nstatus   at    the   time   the   NASD    arbitration      was     initiated,        but\n\nacknowledges that he subsequently obtained counsel who prepared the\n\nbrief and attended the hearings.\n\n              Eighth. In No. 06-1209, Olick appeals from the denial of\n\na recent motion asking that the November 30, 2004 ruling be vacated\n\nand the district court judge be recused.                   We see no basis for\n\neither request. Olick complains that he was not advised of various\n\nfilings and that some of his own submissions were never filed.                       As\n\nto the former, docketed matters were listed on the docket.                       And\n\nOlick provides no support for his suggestion that he was entitled\n\nto be served with or notified of all class action filings.                      As to\n\nthe latter, we note that Olick has been enjoined from filing\n\nfurther papers in this matter without court approval (a ruling not\n\nchallenged     on    appeal).     And     what      appears   to    be    his   chief\n\ncomplaint–-that his first notice of appeal was not accepted for\n\nfiling-–is moot for the reasons indicated above.\n\n              Affirmed.     The    motion      in    No.   05-1485       to   file    a\n\nsupplemental brief and appendix is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\f",

In No. 05-1485, appellee John Hancock suggests\n\nthat our review does not encompass the November 30, 2004 ruling,\n\nbut is instead confined to the February 28, 2005 order denying Rule\n\n59(e) relief.   Although Olick sought to file a separate notice of\n\nappeal from each order, the first one was not accepted for filing,\n\nfor reasons that he now challenges.           If it were true, as Olick\n\nasserts, that the first notice of appeal was rejected simply\n\nbecause it was unaccompanied by the required filing fee or because\n\nit listed the wrong “session identification” at the end of the case\n\nnumber, his challenge would have potential merit.        But we need not\n\nexplore these issues.       Olick’s intent being clear, and Hancock\n\nhaving suffered no prejudice, we conclude that the notice of appeal\n\nfiled on March 21, 2005 sufficed to appeal from both orders.        See,\n\ne.g., Marie v. Allied Home Mtg. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201485\"><a href=\"/opinion/201485/marie-v-allied-home-mtg-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 8 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).   The challenge to the court’s refusal to extend the time to\n\npay the filing fee is thus moot.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f           Second.    In No. 05-1485, just like in the prior appeal,\n\nOlick advances two basic complaints: (1) as to the four policies,\n\nhe charges that Hancock has not made settlement offers that comply\n\nwith the arbitrator’s decision; and (2) as to the seven policies,\n\nhe charges that Hancock improperly excluded them from the ADR\n\nprocess entirely.     Both arguments stumble right out of the gate.\n\nAs he now acknowledges, Olick has relied on the wrong version of\n\nthe settlement agreement–-the original version filed in June 1997,\n\nrather than the amended version filed in October 1997.

Yet Olick had constructive notice thereof; the\n\namended agreement was listed on the docket, for example, and was\n\nprominently mentioned in the district court’s opinion adopting\n\nsame.

Mass. 1997).         An affirmance here would be\n\npermissible on this basis alone.\n\n           Third.    Olick’s claims with respect to the four policies\n\nalso falter on other grounds.      We agree with the district court\n\nthat Olick “has failed to demonstrate in any comprehensible fashion\n\nthat the Hancock offer[s] indeed deviate[] from the arbitrator’s\n\naward.”   Moreover, Olick’s arguments in this regard come too late.\n\nPrior to the first appeal, the district court denied his motion to\n\ncompel without prejudice to his making a showing of noncompliance\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fwith the arbitrator’s decision.            Olick sought reconsideration but\n\nattempted      no    such    showing,    and   on    appeal    we     dismissed    the\n\nallegations of noncompliance as “unsupported.”                      Back before the\n\ndistrict court, he stated that this court had “directed” him “to\n\nfile proof” as to why Hancock’s offers were insufficient; our\n\nopinion contained no such directive.                 And we find nothing in the\n\nallegations now advanced that could not have been raised earlier.\n\n            Fourth.         In a separate argument concerning one of these\n\nfour policies, Olick complains that Hancock has made no settlement\n\noffer at all.       He faults Hancock and the district court for “simply\n\nignor[ing]” this allegation, but it is he who is in default.                        He\n\ndid   not   raise      this     matter   in    his    August       2003   motion   for\n\nreconsideration (after receiving Hancock’s offers), nor on appeal\n\n(voicing no objection to our statement that offers on “each of the\n\nfour” claims had been made), nor in the ensuing motion to compel\n\ncompliance.         The first reference to the lack of such an offer\n\nappeared in the memo accompanying that motion, but no specific\n\ncomplaint was voiced in this regard.                 Thereafter, neither in his\n\nmotion   for    preliminary       determination       nor     in    his   motion   for\n\nsanctions did Olick raise the issue.

The claims involving the seven policies were\n\nexcluded from the ADR process on claim-preclusion grounds, inasmuch\n\nas claims involving those same policies had been the subject of a\n\n1995 NASD arbitration award.          In Olick’s view, the preclusive\n\neffect of the prior arbitration was itself an issue for the\n\narbitrator.   He relies on three main arguments.        He first asserts\n\nthat determining arbitrability here is essentially equivalent to\n\ndetermining class membership: once the latter is established, all\n\nfurther disputes must go to arbitration.       This argument sweeps too\n\nbroadly, for it would deem arbitrable various disputes that have\n\ngenerally been held to be matters for the court.        See, e.g., Marie,\n\n402 F.3d at 11-15 (whether litigation-related activity amounts to\n\nwaiver of arbitration); John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Olick,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"756669\"><a href=\"/opinion/756669/john-hancock-mutual-life-insurance-company-john-hancock-distr-larry-carter/\"><span class=\"volume\">151</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">132</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 137-39 (3d Cir. 1998) (preclusive effect of prior\n\ncourt judgment).\n\n           Olick also contends that the claim-preclusion issue is a\n\nquestion of “eligibility” to participate in the ADR process, which\n\nmeans that, like all such questions, it is to be resolved in the\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fsame manner as substantive claims for relief–-i.e., first by the\n\nCRT and then if necessary by the arbitrator.               Whether or not\n\nOlick’s characterization is correct, this argument is flawed; all\n\neligibility questions are not resolved in that fashion, as a glance\n\nat the “preliminary review” provisions makes clear.\n\n           Finally,     Olick   alleges    that   two   provisions   of   the\n\nsettlement specifically contemplate that claim-preclusion issues\n\nwould be handled by the arbitrator.         The first calls for an award\n\nto be “offset” by any “prior relief” received by a claimant.              Yet\n\nclaim preclusion is not an “offset” mechanism.          And this provision\n\nrefers to “complaint[s] filed with” Hancock, which is not the\n\nsituation here. The second provides that, absent a written request\n\nfor exclusion, a class member would be bound by the settlement\n\ndespite having “previously initiated ... individual litigation.”\n\nThe context makes clear that this refers to pending actions.\n\n           Moreover, the latter two arguments were untimely, having\n\nfirst   surfaced   in   Olick’s   motion    for   reconsideration.        Such\n\ntardiness is especially notable given the earlier round of district\n\ncourt proceedings and our suggestion that Olick might again be able\n\nto raise the matter upon the filing of a “proper” motion.\n\n           Sixth. One of these seven claims made it through the CRT\n\nstage, only to be deemed ineligible prior to arbitration.            Noting\n\nthat all CRT decisions are binding on Hancock (with exceptions not\n\nhere relevant), Olick argues that Hancock was obligated to accept\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fthe CRT’s implicit finding of eligibility.           Yet, as mentioned\n\nabove, all eligibility questions are not submitted to the CRT, and\n\nOlick has provided no reason to think that the CRT actually\n\nconsidered that issue here.\n\n           Seventh. As to the merits of the claim-preclusion issue,\n\nOlick does not argue that the 1995 NASD award was entirely lacking\n\nin preclusive effect, and properly so.      See Olick, 151 F.3d at 140\n\n(noting “parties’ intentional adherence to a binding principle of\n\nfinality similar to res judicata as applied to arbitration awards\n\nrendered by the NASD”).    Instead, he advances various reasons--\n\noften, again, in untimely fashion--why claim preclusion should not\n\napply here.    Each proves unavailing.       He asserts, with little\n\nelaboration, that the NASD claims and the class claims involved\n\ndifferent matters entirely.     Yet a review of the available NASD\n\nmaterials (complaint, brief and ruling) demonstrates some overlap\n\nbetween the two sets of claims.    Indeed, the degree of overlap may\n\nbe higher than first appears; the record contains a June 4, 1998\n\naffidavit from Olick, submitted in connection with the class suit,\n\nwhich focuses on a key issue involved in the NASD arbitration\n\n(alleged   misrepresentations   that    mortality   costs   would   remain\n\nconstant).\n\n           Olick also contends that his class claims could not have\n\nbeen pursued in the NASD arbitration because they relied in part on\n\nnewly discovered evidence, some of which had been concealed by\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fHancock.      Yet he offers no description of such evidence.                         He\n\ncontends that NASD rules forbid arbitration of disputes involving\n\nlife insurance policies, but he took the opposite position before\n\nthe NASD, with obvious success.                And he emphasizes his pro se\n\nstatus   at    the   time   the   NASD    arbitration      was     initiated,        but\n\nacknowledges that he subsequently obtained counsel who prepared the\n\nbrief and attended the hearings.\n\n              Eighth. In No. 06-1209, Olick appeals from the denial of\n\na recent motion asking that the November 30, 2004 ruling be vacated\n\nand the district court judge be recused.                   We see no basis for\n\neither request. Olick complains that he was not advised of various\n\nfilings and that some of his own submissions were never filed.                       As\n\nto the former, docketed matters were listed on the docket.                       And\n\nOlick provides no support for his suggestion that he was entitled\n\nto be served with or notified of all class action filings.                      As to\n\nthe latter, we note that Olick has been enjoined from filing\n\nfurther papers in this matter without court approval (a ruling not\n\nchallenged     on    appeal).     And     what      appears   to    be    his   chief\n\ncomplaint–-that his first notice of appeal was not accepted for\n\nfiling-–is moot for the reasons indicated above.\n\n              Affirmed.     The    motion      in    No.   05-1485       to   file    a\n\nsupplemental brief and appendix is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\f</pre>",
