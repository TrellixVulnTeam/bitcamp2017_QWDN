Plaintiff-appellant Dianne\n\nFoley appeals from a judgment following a jury verdict in favor of\n\nher   former       employer,   defendant-appellee         Commonwealth     Electric\n\nCompany (\"the Company\"), on her gender discrimination claims.                    She\n\ncontends that she did not get a fair trial because the district\n\ncourt erroneously omitted jury instructions concerning vicarious\n\nliability and several aspects of employment discrimination law. We\n\naffirm the judgment below.\n\n                                     I. BACKGROUND\n\n              Foley began working as a meter reader for the Company in\n\nSeptember, 1997.          She began as a temporary employee, then became a\n\nprobationary employee.            Probationary employees are subject to a\n\nsix-month trial period after which they become regular employees\n\nand are covered by applicable collective bargaining agreements.\n\nWhile on probation, they can be terminated by the Company at its\n\ndiscretion.\n\n              On January 22, 1998, midway through her probationary\n\nperiod, Foley was involved in a single-car accident while driving\n\na Company vehicle.          The accident caused several hundred dollars'\n\nworth of damage to the vehicle.\n\n              As    a    result      of   the     accident,      Foley's   immediate\n\nsupervisor, Robb Campbell, decided to terminate her employment.\n\nAfter visiting the accident scene but before interviewing Foley\n\nabout   it,    he       determined    that      the   accident    was   \"avoidable.\"\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\fCampbell's supervisor, Mark Gracie, and the Company's Administrator\n\nfor Labor Relations, Joseph Roda, were notified of and assented to\n\nFoley's termination.        The termination was effective January 23,\n\n1998.\n\n            On March 15, 2000, Foley filed a complaint in the United\n\nStates District Court for the District of Massachusetts.                        She\n\nalleged that the Company discriminated against her on the basis of\n\ngender in violation of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, 42\n\nU.S.C. ยง 2000e et seq., and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B.\n\n            A jury trial began in January, 2002.                 At trial, Foley\n\nattempted to prove her discrimination claims with evidence that\n\nCampbell treated certain male employees who had been involved in\n\ndriving    accidents       more     favorably      than     he      treated     her.\n\nSpecifically, she contended that John LaCava, a contract employee\n\nmeter    reader,   was   not    terminated      following    a     comparable    car\n\naccident, and that Campbell did not even report the accident.1                   She\n\nalso claimed that Nathan Rego, a temporary employee, was terminated\n\nfor an avoidable accident only after several days' delay.                        The\n\nCompany    disputed      that     these    disparities      were    motivated     by\n\ndiscrimination, argued that the facts were dissimilar, and put\n\nforth evidence that under Campbell's supervision, women were hired\n\nand retained at a higher rate than men.\n\n\n\n     1\n      Contract employees worked for the Company via a staffing\nservice on an as-needed basis.\n\n                                          -3-\n\f          After both parties rested their cases, the Company moved\n\nfor a directed verdict.       The motion was denied.\n\n          The district court then conducted a charge conference, in\n\nwhich there was a brief discussion of plaintiff's proposed jury\n\ninstruction No. 3. The proposed instruction read, in its entirety:\n\n          Commonwealth Electric is liable for any\n          discriminatory   act   by   its   supervisory\n          personnel. Therefore, if you find that Mrs.\n          Foley's     supervisor     or    supervisors\n          discriminated against her because she was a\n          woman, you must find for Mrs. Foley.\n\nThe only discussion of proposed instruction No. 3 did not concern\n\nvicarious liability:\n\nThe Court:         With respect to No. 3, I'm not sure--\n                   the objection is it's not complete\n                   enough; is that the objection?\n\nThe Company:       Yes, your Honor, but we don't maintain\n                   that objection particularly strongly.\n                   I think \"because of\" or \"but for\" kind\n                   of language is satisfactory, and that's\n                   the kind of language that Judge Young\n                   went along with.2\n\nNotwithstanding     Foley's    assertion   on   appeal   that   the   court\n\nindicated that it would give this instruction, the court did not\n\nstate its intention one way or the other.\n\n             Foley also submitted several proposed jury instructions\n\nconcerning discrimination.       In the charge conference, the court\n\ndeclined to give proposed instructions 8 and 9, which dealt with\n\n\n     2\n      After this exchange, the court inquired about differences\nbetween the state and federal standards for proving discrimination,\nand then proceeded to discuss the next proposed jury instruction.\n\n                                    -4-\n\funconscious gender bias.      The court cited the absence of evidence\n\nof \"stereotyped thinking, [for example,] about women drivers.\"        It\n\nalso rejected proposed instruction No. 11, which addressed an\n\nemployer's failure to follow its own rules as evidence of bias, but\n\nstated that it would not be improper for Foley to \"argue the point\n\nas part of [her] laying out the circumstances from which they can\n\nmake the inference.\"      Finally, the court declined to give proposed\n\ninstruction No. 12A, which concerned the failure to investigate\n\nsimilarly situated males as evidence of bias, on the ground that\n\nthe language in the proposed instruction resembled disfavored\n\ninstructions on burden shifting.\n\n            The district court charged the jury before the parties'\n\nclosing arguments, and directed counsel to hold any objections to\n\nthe charge until after the closing arguments.3        In its charge, the\n\ndistrict court did not give the proposed instruction concerning\n\nvicarious    liability,    nor   any   of   the   proposed   instructions\n\nconcerning evidence of bias that it had rejected earlier.\n\n            After the closing arguments, Foley's counsel stated that\n\nhe didn't hear an instruction on \"liability of the company for acts\n\nof the supervisors,\" as was proposed in instruction No. 3.           The\n\ncourt answered:\n\n            You're right, you didn't hear it.    I'm not\n            sure it's necessary, is it? . . . [I]t's the\n\n\n     3\n      The district court chose this somewhat unusual order of the\ncharge and closing arguments without objection from the parties.\n\n                                   -5-\n\f              assumption that everybody has had. It hasn't\n              been put in issue by the defendant.\n\nFoley's counsel responded:\n\n              I would say that, you know, there's a\n              distinction made about Mr. Campbell having a\n              target on his head and that Mr. Campbell is\n              the one who's suffering--Well, I object to not\n              giving that one.\n\nFoley's counsel further stated, \"And I also object to not giving\n\nthe ones that we talked about yesterday, the stereotyping . . .\n\n[a]nd   the    failure   to   investigate   and   the   failure   to   follow\n\nprocedures.\"      The court responded, \"Okay,\" and did not ask for\n\nclarification.\n\n              The jury returned a verdict in favor of the Company on\n\nall counts.      Final judgment was entered on January 24, 2002.\n\n                               II. DISCUSSION\n\n              Fed. R. Civ. P. 51 requires a party to object to an\n\ninstruction \"before the jury retires to consider its verdict,\n\nstating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the\n\nobjection.\"      If a party complies with Rule 51, then the harmless\n\nerror standard governs. Babcock v. Gen. Motors Corp., 299 F.3d 60,\n\n64 (1st Cir. 2002).       Fed. R. Civ. P. 61 sets forth the harmless\n\nerror rule:\n\n              No error in either the admission or the\n              exclusion of evidence and no error or defect\n              in any ruling or order or in anything done or\n              omitted by the court or by any of the parties\n              is ground for granting a new trial or for\n              setting aside a verdict or for vacating,\n              modifying, or otherwise disturbing a judgment\n\n                                    -6-\n\f            or order, unless refusal to take such action\n            appears to the court inconsistent with\n            substantial justice. . . .\n\n            In   the   absence   of   a     properly   preserved    objection,\n\nhowever, this court reviews the trial judge's jury instructions\n\nunder the plain error standard.           Gray v. Genlyte Group, Inc., 289\n\nF.3d 128, 134 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 123 S.Ct. 485 (2002).               The\n\nparty claiming plain error is required to demonstrate \"(1) that\n\nthere was error, (2) that it was plain, (3) that it likely altered\n\nthe outcome, and (4) that it was sufficiently fundamental to\n\nthreaten the fairness or integrity or public reputation of the\n\njudicial proceedings.\"         Id. (citing United States v. Olano, 507\n\nU.S. 725, 735-36 (1993)).\n\n            We first consider the district court's omission of the\n\nvicarious liability instruction.          The Company contends that Foley\n\ndid   not   preserve     her     objection,      pointing   out      that   our\n\ninterpretation of Rule 51 is quite strict.             See Babcock, 299 F.3d\n\nat 64; Gray, 289 F.3d at 134.         Even if the initial request for an\n\ninstruction is made in detail, the requesting party must object\n\nagain after the instructions are given but before the jury retires\n\nfor deliberations.      Gray, 289 F.3d at 134 (citing Smith v. Mass.\n\nInst. of Tech., 877 F.2d 1106, 1109 (1st Cir. 1989)).              \"[I]t is not\n\nenough for counsel in renewing an objection merely to refer back\n\ngenerically to objections made before the charge.\"             Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f          Foley's   counsel's      objection   to   the   omission   of   the\n\nvicarious liability instruction may or may not fall short of the\n\nstringent requirements of Rule 51.        His statement that \"there's a\n\ndistinction made about Mr. Campbell having a target on his head and\n\nthat Mr. Campbell is the one who's suffering\" is not a particularly\n\nlucid expression of the ground for his objection.             We need not\n\ndecide this issue, however, because under either the harmless error\n\nor plain error standard, the district court's omission does not\n\nwarrant reversal.\n\n           An instruction as to the Company's liability for Campbell\n\nand the other supervisors' actions certainly would have been\n\nappropriate under Title VII and chapter 151B.              See Burlington\n\nIndus., Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, 762 (1998) (\"[A] tangible\n\nemployment action taken by the supervisor becomes for Title VII\n\npurposes the act of the employer.\"); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, ยง 4\n\n(unlawful practice for \"an employer, personally or through its\n\nagents,   to   sexually   harass    any   employee\").       Although      this\n\ninstruction optimally should have been included in the charge, its\n\nabsence does not require a new trial.\n\n          As the district court pointed out, no one suggested at\n\ntrial that the Company was not responsible for its supervisors'\n\nactions, or indeed that any meaningful distinction could be made\n\nbetween the supervisors and the Company.              Moreover, the only\n\nevidence presented to the jury concerning discrimination against\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fFoley involved her supervisors' treatment of her with regard to her\n\ncar accident.         No other allegedly discriminatory treatment or\n\ncompany policy was implicated.            It is simply not reasonable to\n\nsurmise that, in the absence of specific instruction concerning\n\nvicarious liability, the jury determined that Campbell's actions\n\nconstituted unlawful discrimination but that the Company should not\n\nbe   held   liable.      In    the   context   of    the   evidence   presented,\n\ntherefore, any error was harmless.\n\n             Foley's next argument on appeal is that the district\n\ncourt erred in failing to give certain of the proposed instructions\n\nconcerning    evidence    of    gender   bias:      namely,   the   instructions\n\ndealing with unconscious stereotyping, the Company's failure to\n\nfollow its own procedures, and its failure to investigate similarly\n\nsituated males.       Her objections to the court's omission of these\n\ninstructions were not properly preserved under Rule 51.                  Foley's\n\ncounsel simply stated: \"And I also object to not giving the ones\n\nthat we talked about yesterday, the stereotyping . . .                  And the\n\nfailure to investigate and the failure to follow procedures.\"\n\nWhile this may have been adequate to put the district court on\n\nnotice as to which instructions he was referencing, it did not\n\nstate any grounds for the objection, much less state such grounds\n\n\"distinctly\" as required by the Rule. He merely referred generally\n\nback to the objections he made at the charge conference, which is\n\n\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\finsufficient under Rule 51.             See Gray, 289 F.3d at 134, and cases\n\ncited.4\n\n                Accordingly, we apply the much more stringent plain error\n\nrule.     Id.    This is not the sort of \"exceptional case\" that merits\n\nreversal under a plain error analysis.                  See id.      After reviewing\n\nthe district court's jury charge as a whole, we conclude that the\n\nomission of the requested instructions concerning bias does not\n\nmerit a new trial.            See Testa v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 144 F.3d\n\n173, 175        (1st   Cir.    1998)    (in     reviewing   jury    instructions    to\n\ndetermine whether they adequately illuminate the applicable law\n\nwithout unduly complicating matters or misleading the jury, we\n\nexamine the        instructions        as   a   whole   rather     than   taking   each\n\nfragment in isolation).\n\n                Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      Indeed, at oral argument Foley conceded that \"it would be a\nstretch\" to say that the objection was properly preserved below.\n\n                                            -10-\n\f",

Gen. Motors Corp.,</i> 299 F.3d 60, 64 (1st Cir.2002). Fed.R.Civ.P. 61 sets forth the harmless error rule:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No error in either the admission or the exclusion of evidence and no error or defect in any ruling or order or in anything done or omitted by the court or by any of the parties is ground for granting a new trial or for setting aside a verdict or for vacating, modifying, or otherwise disturbing a judgment or order, unless refusal to take such action appears to the court inconsistent with substantial justice....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the absence of a properly preserved objection, however, this court reviews the trial judge's jury instructions under the plain error standard. <i>Gray v.

The party claiming plain error is required to demonstrate \"(1) that there was error, (2) that it was plain, (3) that it likely altered the outcome, and (4) that it was sufficiently fundamental to threaten the fairness or integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 735-36, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first consider the district court's omission of the vicarious liability instruction. The Company contends that Foley did not preserve her objection, pointing out that our interpretation of Rule 51 is quite strict. <i>See Babcock,</i> 299 F.3d at 64; <i>Gray,</i> 289 F.3d at 134. Even if the initial request for an instruction is made in detail, the requesting party must object again after the instructions are given but before the jury retires for deliberations. <i>Gray,</i> 289 F.3d at 134 (citing <i>Smith v. Mass. Inst. of Tech.,</i> 877 F.2d 1106, 1109 (1st Cir.1989)). \"[I]t is not enough for counsel in renewing an objection merely to refer back generically to objections made before the charge.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Foley's counsel's objection to the omission of the vicarious liability instruction may or may not fall short of the stringent requirements of Rule 51. His statement that \"there's a distinction made about Mr. Campbell having a target on his head and that Mr. Campbell is the one who's suffering\" is not a particularly lucid expression of the ground for his objection. We need not decide this issue, however, because under either the harmless error or plain error standard, the district court's omission does not warrant reversal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An instruction as to the Company's liability for Campbell and the other supervisors' actions certainly would have been appropriate under Title VII and chapter 151B. <i>See Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth,</i> 524 U.S. 742, 762, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 141 L.Ed.2d 633 (1998) (\"[A] tangible employment action taken by the supervisor becomes for Title VII purposes the act of the employer.\"); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, &#167; 4 (unlawful practice for \"an employer, personally or through its agents, to sexually harass any employee\"). Although this instruction optimally should have been included in the charge, its absence does not require a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court pointed out, no one suggested at trial that the Company was not responsible for its supervisors' actions, or indeed that any meaningful distinction could be made between the supervisors and the Company. Moreover, the only evidence presented to the jury concerning discrimination against Foley involved her supervisors' treatment of her with regard to her car accident. No other allegedly discriminatory treatment or company policy was implicated. It is simply not reasonable to surmise that, in the absence of specific instruction concerning vicarious liability, the jury determined that Campbell's actions constituted unlawful discrimination but that the Company should not be held liable. In the context of the evidence presented, therefore, any error was harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Foley's next argument on appeal is that the district court erred in failing to give certain of the proposed instructions concerning evidence of gender bias: namely, the instructions dealing with unconscious stereotyping, the Company's failure to follow its own procedures, and its failure to investigate similarly situated males. Her objections to the court's omission of these instructions were not properly preserved under Rule 51. Foley's counsel simply stated: \"And I also object to not giving the ones that we talked about yesterday, the stereotyping ... And the failure to investigate and the failure to follow procedures.\" While this may have been adequate to put the district court on notice as to which instructions he was referencing, it did not state <i>any</i> grounds for the objection, much less state such grounds \"distinctly\" as required by the Rule. He merely referred generally back to the objections he made at the charge conference, which is insufficient under Rule 51. <i>See Gray,</i> 289 F.3d at 134, and cases cited.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we apply the much more stringent plain error rule. <i>Id.</i> This is not the sort of \"exceptional case\" that merits reversal under a plain error analysis. <i>See id.</i> After reviewing the district court's jury charge as a whole, we conclude that the omission of the requested instructions concerning bias does not merit a new trial. <i>See Testa v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,</i> 144 F.3d 173, 175 (1st Cir. 1998) (in reviewing jury instructions to determine whether they adequately illuminate the applicable law without unduly complicating matters or misleading the jury, we examine the instructions as a whole rather than taking each fragment in isolation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Contract employees worked for the Company via a staffing service on an as-needed basis</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> After this exchange, the court inquired about differences between the state and federal standards for proving discrimination, and then proceeded to discuss the next proposed jury instruction</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The district court chose this somewhat unusual order of the charge and closing arguments without objection from the parties</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Indeed, at oral argument Foley conceded that \"it would be a stretch\" to say that the objection was properly preserved below</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

She contends that she did not get a fair trial because the district court erroneously omitted jury instructions concerning vicarious liability and several aspects of employment discrimination law. We affirm the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>BACKGROUND</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Foley began working as a meter reader for the Company in September, 1997. She began as a temporary employee, then became a probationary employee. Probationary employees are subject to a six-month trial period after which they become regular employees and are covered by applicable collective bargaining agreements. While on probation, they can be terminated by the Company at its discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 22, 1998, midway through her probationary period, Foley was involved in a single-car accident while driving a Company vehicle. The accident caused several hundred dollars' worth of damage to the vehicle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of the accident, Foley's immediate supervisor, Robb Campbell, decided to terminate her employment. After visiting the accident scene but before interviewing Foley about it, he determined that the accident was \"avoidable.\" Campbell's supervisor, Mark Gracie, and the Company's Administrator for Labor Relations, Joseph Roda, were notified of and assented to Foley's termination. The termination was effective January 23, 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 15, 2000, Foley filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. She alleged that the Company discriminated against her on the basis of gender in violation of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e <i>et seq.,</i> and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A jury trial began in January, 2002. At trial, Foley attempted to prove her discrimination claims with evidence that Campbell treated certain male employees who had been involved in driving accidents more favorably than he treated her. Specifically, she contended that John LaCava, a contract employee meter reader, was not terminated following a comparable car accident, and that Campbell did not even report the accident.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> She also claimed that Nathan Rego, a temporary employee, was terminated for an avoidable accident only after several days' delay. The Company disputed that these disparities were motivated by discrimination, argued that the facts were dissimilar, and put forth evidence that under Campbell's supervision, women were hired and retained at a higher rate than men.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After both parties rested their cases, the Company moved for a directed verdict. The motion was denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court then conducted a charge conference, in which there was a brief discussion of plaintiff's proposed jury instruction No. 3.

His statement that \"there's a distinction made about Mr. Campbell having a target on his head and that Mr. Campbell is the one who's suffering\" is not a particularly lucid expression of the ground for his objection. We need not decide this issue, however, because under either the harmless error or plain error standard, the district court's omission does not warrant reversal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An instruction as to the Company's liability for Campbell and the other supervisors' actions certainly would have been appropriate under Title VII and chapter 151B. <i>See Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118244\"><a href=\"/opinion/118244/burlington-industries-inc-v-ellerth/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">742</span></a></span>, 762, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118244\"><a href=\"/opinion/118244/burlington-industries-inc-v-ellerth/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Laws ch. 151B, &#167; 4 (unlawful practice for \"an employer, personally or through its agents, to sexually harass any employee\"). Although this instruction optimally should have been included in the charge, its absence does not require a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court pointed out, no one suggested at trial that the Company was not responsible for its supervisors' actions, or indeed that any meaningful distinction could be made between the supervisors and the Company. Moreover, the only evidence presented to the jury concerning discrimination against Foley involved her supervisors' treatment of her with regard to her car accident. No other allegedly discriminatory treatment or company policy was implicated. It is simply not reasonable to surmise that, in the absence of specific instruction concerning vicarious liability, the jury determined that Campbell's actions constituted unlawful discrimination but that the Company should not be held liable. In the context of the evidence presented, therefore, any error was harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Foley's next argument on appeal is that the district court erred in failing to give certain of the proposed instructions concerning evidence of gender bias: namely, the instructions dealing with unconscious stereotyping, the Company's failure to follow its own procedures, and its failure to investigate similarly situated males. Her objections to the court's omission of these instructions were not properly preserved under Rule 51. Foley's counsel simply stated: \"And I also object to not giving the ones that we talked about yesterday, the stereotyping ... And the failure to investigate and the failure to follow procedures.\" While this may have been adequate to put the district court on notice as to which instructions he was referencing, it did not state <i>any</i> grounds for the objection, much less state such grounds \"distinctly\" as required by the Rule. He merely referred generally back to the objections he made at the charge conference, which is insufficient under Rule 51. <i>See Gray,</i> 289 F.3d at 134, and cases cited.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we apply the much more stringent plain error rule. <i>Id.</i> This is not the sort of \"exceptional case\" that merits reversal under a plain error analysis. <i>See id.</i> After reviewing the district court's jury charge as a whole, we conclude that the omission of the requested instructions concerning bias does not merit a new trial. <i>See Testa v.
