The appellants, Carroll Shelby,\n\nShelby       American,      Inc.,    and   Carroll    Shelby       Licensing,     Inc.\n\n(collectively, Shelby), cloak this appeal in the raiment of trade-\n\ndress       law.     That    masquerade    ignores    the    central    question    of\n\nmootness       (an   issue    that   Shelby      attempted    to   obscure   in    its\n\nappellate filings).           For the reasons that follow, we conclude that\n\nShelby's appeal must be dismissed and that vacation of the decision\n\nbelow is unwarranted.\n\n               The predicate facts are straightforward.                In the 1960s,\n\nShelby manufactured and sold the Shelby Cobra 427 S/C.                    After the\n\ninitial commercial production of the automobile had run its course,\n\na Cobra replica industry emerged. Defendant-appellee Superformance\n\nInternational, Inc. is a player in that industry.                       It markets,\n\nimports, and sells the Superformance 427 S/C — a rolling chassis\n\nidentical in design to the Shelby Cobra 427 S/C.1                      Superformance\n\nuses the same mark (427 S/C) and emblem badges (Cobra) on its\n\nreplicas as Shelby used on the originals.\n\n               In late 2000, Shelby commenced a civil action against\n\nSuperformance in the United States District Court for the District\n\nof Massachusetts. Its complaint contained a host of trademark- and\n\ntrade-dress-based claims premised on theories of infringement,\n\n\n\n\n        1\n      A rolling chassis is essentially a car body without an engine\nor a transmission.\n\n                                           -2-\n\fcounterfeiting,    dilution,       unfair    competition,      and   the    like.2\n\nSuperformance    answered    the    complaint    and   filed    counterclaims.\n\nAfter a great deal of skirmishing, not relevant here, the district\n\ncourt granted Superformance's motion for partial summary judgment\n\non Shelby's trade-dress claims (comprising parts of five of the\n\nseven counts contained in Shelby's amended complaint).                     Carroll\n\nShelby Licensing, Inc. v. Superformance Int'l, Inc., 251 F. Supp.\n\n2d 983, 988 (D. Mass. 2002).\n\n          The court's decision focused on the issue of secondary\n\nmeaning — a showing necessary to Shelby's success on the trade-\n\ndress-related claims.       See id. at 986.      Although Shelby submitted\n\nsurvey evidence of secondary meaning, the district court deemed\n\nthat evidence \"insufficient to support a reasonable jury finding in\n\nShelby's favor on the issue.\"        Id.    Since the court also determined\n\nthat the proffered circumstantial evidence was \"equally unavailing\"\n\nto show secondary meaning, it entered summary judgment in favor of\n\nSuperformance.    Id. at 987.       That was not a final order, however,\n\nas district court proceedings continued on the remaining trademark\n\nclaims and on Superformance's counterclaims.\n\n          On December 17, 2004, Shelby moved for final judgment by\n\nconsent, a permanent injunction, and vacation of the partial\n\n\n     2\n      Ford Motor Co., which had partnered with Shelby in the\noriginal venture, later intervened as a plaintiff in this action,\nalleging its own trademark claims against Superformance.    Since\nFord is not a party to this appeal, the evolution of those claims\nneed not be traced here.\n\n                                      -3-\n\fsummary judgment order.          Shelby informed the district court that\n\nthe consent judgment was \"an integral part of a global settlement\n\nof all matters in dispute between the parties\" and represented\n\nthat it had entered into a license agreement with Superformance for\n\nthe trade-dress rights associated with the Shelby Cobra 427 S/C.\n\nImportuning      the    court   to     vacate    its    earlier   decree,    Shelby\n\nexplained    that      the   consent    judgment       would   \"facilitate   a   new\n\nbusiness relationship between the parties, which now encompasses\n\nthe trade dress issues that [were] the subject of the [summary\n\njudgment] order.\"\n\n            The district court entered the proffered consent judgment\n\nand permanent injunction.              At the same time, the court denied\n\nShelby's motion to vacate the summary judgment order. Shelby filed\n\na timely appeal \"from the final judgment entered in this action.\"\n\nIts notice of appeal singled out the summary judgment order, but\n\ndid not mention the denial of the motion to vacate.\n\n            In its appellate brief, Shelby followed the same path.\n\nIt frontally challenged the merits of the summary judgment order,\n\narguing that the district court erred by (i) not conducting an\n\nanalysis of indirect evidence of secondary meaning (which, if\n\nproperly evaluated, would have raised a genuine issue of material\n\nfact   as   to   secondary      meaning)   and    (ii)    rejecting   the    survey\n\nevidence (which, if properly evaluated, also would have sufficed to\n\nraise a genuine issue of material fact as to secondary meaning).\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fShelby made a passing reference to the consent judgment in its\n\njurisdictional statement but did not mention its settlement with\n\nSuperformance in either its statement of facts or in the argument\n\nsection of its brief.   It made no allusion whatever to the denial\n\nof its motion to vacate the partial summary judgment order.\n\n          Superformance elected not to file a brief.     Fortunately,\n\nhowever, several manufacturers and sellers of kit cars sought leave\n\nto file an amicus brief.    We allowed their motion on August 26,\n\n2005, and subsequently granted them permission to argue orally.\n\n          The amicus brief brought the parties' settlement and the\n\ndenial of the motion to vacate to the forefront for the first time.\n\nThe amici suggested that we should dismiss the appeal as moot and\n\nthat, notwithstanding the dismissal, the summary judgment order\n\nshould remain intact.   Despite the fact that the amicus brief was\n\nfiled well in advance of oral argument, Shelby eschewed the filing\n\nof a reply brief and did not address the issue of mootness until\n\nthe panel began asking questions about it at oral argument.     As we\n\nexplain below, that was too little and too late.\n\n          At the risk of belaboring the obvious, we begin our\n\ndiscussion of the issues by noting that all of Shelby's arguments\n\nconcerning mootness and its effects seem to have been waived.      A\n\nnotice of appeal must specify the order appealed from.    See Fed. R.\n\nApp. P. 3(c)(1)(B) (requiring that a notice of appeal \"designate\n\nthe judgment, order, or part thereof being appealed\").     Here, even\n\n\n                                -5-\n\fthough the district court explicitly denied a motion to vacate the\n\npartial summary judgment, Shelby did not frame its appeal as a\n\nchallenge, in whole or in part, to that order.                    A party's failure\n\nto designate a particular order for appeal ordinarily defeats a\n\nlater attempt to dispute that order in the court of appeals.                   See,\n\ne.g.,       Smith   v.   Barry,    502   U.S.   244,   248    (1992);    Lehman   v.\n\nRevolution Portfolio, LLC, 166 F.3d 389, 395 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\nShelby offers no plausible reason why we should not apply that\n\nprinciple here.3\n\n               Even had Shelby forthrightly addressed the point, we\n\nnevertheless would dismiss this appeal as moot and decline to\n\ndirect the lower court to vacate its summary judgment order.                      We\n\nexplain briefly.\n\n               A    federal   court's     jurisdiction       is    constitutionally\n\nrestricted to the resolution of actual cases or controversies. See\n\nU.S. Const. art. III, § 2, cl. 1; see also Lewis v. Cont'l Bank\n\nCorp., 494 U.S. 472, 477 (1990); Cruz v. Farquharson, 252 F.3d 530,\n\n533 (1st Cir. 2001).              \"A case generally becomes moot when the\n\ncontroversy is no longer 'live' or the parties 'lack a legal[ly]\n\n\n        3\n      Shelby's appellate brief contains nary a syllable about the\ndistrict court's denial of the motion to vacate, nor does it\nconfront the issue of mootness. It took direct questioning by this\ncourt to elicit Shelby's views about mootness and the related issue\nof vacatur.    That will not do: on appeal, \"a litigant has an\nobligation to spell out its arguments squarely and distinctly, or\nelse forever hold its peace.\" United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d\n1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (citations and internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n\n                                          -6-\n\fcognizable interest in the outcome.'\"         Ortiz-Gonzalez v. Fonovisa,\n\n277 F.3d 59, 64 (1st Cir. 2002) (quoting Murphy v. Hunt, 455 U.S.\n\n478, 481 (1982) (per curiam)). It is, therefore, clear beyond hope\n\nof contradiction that a global settlement moots an action between\n\nthe settling parties arising out of the same subject matter.             See,\n\ne.g., Lake Coal Co. v. Roberts & Schaefer Co., 474 U.S. 120, 120\n\n(1985) (per curiam); Horizon Bank & Trust Co. v. Massachusetts, 391\n\nF.3d 48, 53 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n             Shelby contests the applicability of this abecedarian\n\ntenet   on   the   ground   that   its     settlement   with   Superformance\n\naddressed only trademark issues and, thus, left extant a live\n\ncontroversy as to trade dress.           Shelby's representations to the\n\ndistrict court belie that contention.\n\n             In its motion for entry of judgment by consent, Shelby\n\ndescribed a \"global settlement of all matters in dispute\" and\n\nacknowledged that it had granted a license to Superformance that\n\n\"include[d] the trade dress rights in the Shelby Cobra 427 S/C\n\nautomobile.\"       Based    on   these   unequivocal    statements   —   the\n\nsettlement agreement itself is not part of the record — we have no\n\nreason to doubt that there has been a resolution of all the\n\ncontroverted issues between the parties.          Not only are the parties\n\nno longer adversaries in this case, but their interests are now\n\nfully aligned: Superformance, as the licensee of Shelby's trade-\n\ndress rights, has as much interest in protecting those rights as\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fdoes Shelby itself.       It comes as no surprise, therefore, that\n\nSuperformance elected not to defend the summary judgment order\n\nbefore this court.     By any measure, this appeal is moot.   See Aqua\n\nMarine Supply v. AIM Machining, Inc., 247 F.3d 1216, 1219-20 (Fed.\n\nCir. 2001) (concluding that in a patent infringement action an\n\nappeal is moot when the appellee no longer has an interest in\n\ndefending the judgment of invalidity that it obtained below).\n\n            That is not the end of the matter. Shelby seeks vacation\n\nof the partial summary judgment order and, even though we must\n\ndismiss this appeal as moot, we retain jurisdiction to decide the\n\nquestion of vacatur.        U.S. Bancorp Mortg. Co. v. Bonner Mall\n\nP'ship, 513 U.S. 18, 21 (1994).      We turn to that question.\n\n            The \"principal condition\" to which courts look when\n\nengaging the vacatur calculus is \"whether the party seeking relief\n\nfrom the judgment below caused the mootness by voluntary action.\"\n\nId. at 24. Vacatur is ordinarily appropriate when mootness results\n\nfrom vagarious circumstance or the unilateral act of the prevailing\n\nparty.    Id. at 25.   When mootness stems from a settlement, however,\n\nthe presumption is different. In that situation, \"the losing party\n\nhas . . . surrender[ed its] claim to the equitable remedy of\n\nvacatur.    The judgment is not unreviewable, but simply unreviewed\n\nby [the losing party's] own choice.\"          Id.    The presumption,\n\ntherefore, is that the judgment previously obtained should remain\n\nintact.    See id.\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\f            That presumption comes into play here.                   By entering a\n\nglobal settlement with Superformance, Shelby (the summary judgment\n\nloser) relinquished any claim to vacatur as of right.\n\n            Of      course,      the    U.S.    Bancorp    presumptions      are    not\n\nironclad,     and    exceptional        circumstances     may    justify     different\n\nresults.    See id. at 29.         In this instance, Shelby maintains that\n\nthe presumption against vacatur is rebutted by the equities.                         In\n\nelaboration, it first contends that allowing the summary judgment\n\nto stand will have an institutionally detrimental impact because\n\nthe district court's holding is in conflict with trade-dress law.\n\n            That is resupinate reasoning. It invites us to reach the\n\nmerits of the order in question and adopt the settling party's\n\nunopposed view of them.                That disingenuous invitation seriously\n\ndistorts the U.S. Bancorp standard, and we decline to accept it.\n\nSee Aqua Marine, 247 F.3d at 1221.\n\n            Shelby also argues that the terms of the settlement\n\nagreement preserve its right to appeal from the district court's\n\nsummary judgment order.                Because Shelby has not produced the\n\nsettlement agreement, that argument asks us to take on faith a\n\nmatter   dehors      the    record.        In    all   events,   even   if    Shelby's\n\ndepiction of the settlement is accurate, the reservation of a right\n\nof   appeal      does      not   constitute       an   exceptional      circumstance\n\nsufficient to justify vacation of an underlying judgment.                          After\n\nall, if the \"fact that the settlement agreement provides for\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\fvacatur\" does not constitute an exceptional circumstance, U.S.\n\nBancorp, 513 U.S. at 29, the fact that the agreement includes a\n\nright       of    appeal   cannot   conceivably   be   entitled   to   greater\n\ndeference.\n\n                 If more were needed — and we are confident that it is not\n\n— we emphasize that vacatur is an equitable remedy.           See, e.g., id.\n\nat 25.           In constructing that balance, Shelby's actions weigh\n\nheavily against it. As recounted above, Shelby omitted any mention\n\nof its unsuccessful motion to vacate the summary judgment order in\n\nits appellate filings, effectively obscured the import of the\n\nsettlement agreement in those filings, and never acknowledged that\n\nthe issue of mootness hovered like a dark cloud over this appeal.\n\nCourts ought not to reward a party's evasiveness by granting it\n\nrelief that it does not deserve.          We will not do so here.\n\n                 We need go no further.4      For the reasons elucidated\n\nabove, we dismiss this appeal as moot and leave intact the district\n\ncourt's partial summary judgment order.\n\n\n\nDismissed.\n\n\n\n\n        4\n      We wish to thank the amici and their counsel for their\nhelpful participation in these proceedings.\n\n                                       -10-\n\f",

Here, even though the district court explicitly denied a motion to vacate the partial summary judgment, Shelby did not frame its appeal as a challenge, in whole or in part, to that order. A party's failure to designate a particular order for appeal ordinarily defeats a later attempt to dispute that order in the court of appeals. <i>See, e.g., Smith v.

It is, therefore, clear beyond hope of contradiction that a global settlement moots an action between the settling parties arising out of the same subject matter. <i>See, e.g., Lake Coal Co. v. Roberts &amp; Schaefer Co.,</i> 474 U.S. 120, 120, 106 S.Ct. 553, 88 L.Ed.2d 418 (1985) (per curiam); <i>Horizon Bank &amp; Trust Co. v.

Shelby's representations to the district court belie that contention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its motion for entry of judgment by consent, Shelby described a \"global settlement of all matters in dispute\" and acknowledged that it had granted a license to Superformance that \"include[d] the trade dress rights in the Shelby Cobra 427 S/C automobile.\" Based on these unequivocal statements &#8212; the settlement agreement itself is not part of the record &#8212; we have no reason to doubt that there has been a resolution of all the controverted issues between the parties. Not only are the parties no longer adversaries in this case, but their interests are now fully aligned: Superformance, as the licensee of Shelby's trade-dress rights, has as much interest in protecting those rights as does Shelby itself. It comes as no surprise, therefore, that Superformance elected not to defend the summary judgment order before this court. By any measure, this appeal is moot. <i>See Aqua Marine Supply v. AIM Machining, Inc.,</i> 247 F.3d 1216, 1219-20 (Fed.Cir.2001) (concluding that in a patent infringement action an appeal is moot when the appellee no longer has an interest in defending the judgment of invalidity that it obtained below).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That is not the end of the matter. Shelby seeks vacation of the partial summary judgment order and, even though we must dismiss this appeal as moot, we retain jurisdiction to decide the question of vacatur. <i>U.S. Bancorp Mortg. Co. v. Bonner Mall P'ship,</i> 513 U.S. 18, 21, 115 S.Ct. 386, 130 L.Ed.2d 233 (1994). We turn to that question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"principal condition\" to which courts look when engaging the vacatur calculus is \"whether the party seeking relief from the judgment below caused the mootness by voluntary action.\" <i>Id.</i> at 24, 115 S.Ct. 386. Vacatur is ordinarily appropriate when mootness results from vagarious circumstance or the unilateral act of the prevailing party. <i>Id.</i> at 25, 115 S.Ct. 386. When mootness stems from a settlement, however, the presumption is different. In that situation, \"the losing party has ... surrender[ed its] claim to the equitable remedy of vacatur. The judgment is not unreviewable, but simply unreviewed by [the losing party's] own choice.\" <i>Id.</i> The presumption, therefore, is that the judgment previously obtained should remain intact. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That presumption comes into play here. By entering a global settlement with Superformance, Shelby (the summary judgment loser) relinquished any claim to vacatur as of right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the <i>U.S. Bancorp</i> presumptions are not ironclad, and exceptional circumstances may justify different results. <i>See id.</i> at 29, 115 S.Ct. 386. In this instance, Shelby maintains that the presumption against vacatur is rebutted by the equities. In elaboration, it first contends that allowing the summary judgment to stand will have an institutionally detrimental impact because the district court's holding is in conflict with trade-dress law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That is resupinate reasoning. It invites us to reach the merits of the order in question and adopt the settling party's unopposed view of them. That disingenuous invitation seriously distorts the <i>U.S. Bancorp</i> standard, and we decline to accept it. <i>See Aqua Marine,</i> 247 F.3d at 1221.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shelby also argues that the terms of the settlement agreement preserve its right to appeal from the district court's summary judgment order. Because Shelby has not produced the settlement agreement, that argument asks us to take on faith a matter dehors the record. In all events, even if Shelby's depiction of the settlement is accurate, the reservation of a right of appeal does not constitute an exceptional circumstance sufficient to justify vacation of an underlying judgment. After all, if the \"fact that the settlement agreement provides for vacatur\" does not constitute an exceptional circumstance, <i>U.S. Bancorp,</i> 513 U.S. at 29, 115 S.Ct. 386, the fact that the agreement includes a right of appeal cannot conceivably be entitled to greater deference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If more were needed &#8212; and we are confident that it is not &#8212; we emphasize that vacatur is an equitable remedy. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> at 25, 115 S.Ct. 386. In constructing that balance, Shelby's actions weigh heavily against it. As recounted above, Shelby omitted any mention of its unsuccessful motion to vacate the summary judgment order in its appellate filings, effectively obscured the import of the settlement agreement in those filings, and never acknowledged that the issue of mootness hovered like a dark cloud over this appeal. Courts ought not to reward a party's evasiveness by granting it relief that it does not deserve.

(collectively, Shelby), cloak this appeal in the raiment of trade-dress law. That masquerade ignores the central question of mootness (an issue that Shelby attempted to obscure in its appellate filings). For the reasons that follow, we conclude that Shelby's appeal must be dismissed and that vacation of the decision below is unwarranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The predicate facts are straightforward. In the 1960s, Shelby manufactured and sold the Shelby Cobra 427 S/C. After the initial commercial production of the automobile had run its course, a Cobra replica industry emerged. Defendant-appellee Superformance International, Inc. is a player in that industry. It markets, imports, and sells the Superformance 427 S/C &#8212; a rolling chassis identical in design to the Shelby Cobra 427 S/C.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Superformance uses the same mark (427 S/C) and emblem badges (Cobra) on its replicas as Shelby used on the originals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late 2000, Shelby commenced a civil action against Superformance in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. Its complaint contained a host of trademark &#8212; and trade-dress-based claims premised on theories of infringement, counterfeiting, dilution, unfair competition, and the like.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Superformance answered the complaint and filed counterclaims. After a great deal of skirmishing, not relevant here, the district court granted Superformance's motion for partial summary judgment on Shelby's trade-dress claims (comprising parts of five of the seven counts contained in Shelby's amended complaint). <i>Carroll Shelby Licensing, Inc. v. Superformance Int'l, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2340797\"><a href=\"/opinion/2340797/carroll-shelby-licensing-inc-v-superformance-intl-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">251</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Although Shelby submitted survey evidence of secondary meaning, the district court deemed that evidence \"insufficient to support a reasonable jury finding in Shelby's favor on the issue.\" <i>Id.</i> Since the court also determined that the proffered circumstantial evidence was \"equally unavailing\" to show secondary meaning, it entered summary judgment in favor of Superformance. <i>Id.</i> at 987. That was not a final order, however, as district court proceedings continued on the remaining trademark claims and on Superformance's counterclaims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 17, 2004, Shelby moved for final judgment by consent, a permanent injunction, and vacation of the partial summary judgment order. Shelby informed the district court that the consent judgment was \"an integral part of a global settlement of all matters in dispute between the parties\" and represented that it had entered into a license agreement with Superformance for the trade-dress rights associated with the Shelby Cobra 427 S/C. Importuning the court to vacate its earlier decree, Shelby explained that the consent judgment would \"facilitate a new business relationship between the parties, which now encompasses the trade dress issues that [were] the subject of the [summary judgment] order.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court entered the proffered consent judgment and permanent injunction. At the same time, the court denied Shelby's motion to vacate the summary judgment order. Shelby filed a timely appeal \"from the final judgment entered in this action.\" Its notice of appeal singled out the summary judgment order, but did not mention the denial of the motion to vacate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its appellate brief, Shelby followed the same path. It frontally challenged the merits of the summary judgment order, arguing that the district court erred by (i) not conducting an analysis of indirect evidence of secondary meaning (which, if properly evaluated, would have raised a genuine issue of material fact as to secondary meaning) and (ii) rejecting the survey evidence (which, if properly evaluated, also would have sufficed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to secondary meaning). Shelby made a passing reference to the consent judgment in its jurisdictional statement but did not mention its settlement with Superformance in either its statement of facts or in the argument section of its brief. It made no allusion whatever to the denial of its motion to vacate the partial summary judgment order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Superformance elected not to file a brief. Fortunately, however, several manufacturers and sellers of kit cars sought leave to file an amicus brief.

Despite the fact that the amicus brief was filed well in advance of oral argument, Shelby eschewed the filing of a reply brief and did not address the issue of mootness until the panel began asking questions about it at oral argument.

Not only are the parties no longer adversaries in this case, but their interests are now fully aligned: Superformance, as the licensee of Shelby's trade-dress rights, has as much interest in protecting those rights as does Shelby itself. It comes as no surprise, therefore, that Superformance elected not to defend the summary judgment order before this court. By any measure, this appeal is moot. <i>See Aqua Marine Supply v. AIM Machining, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772992\"><a href=\"/opinion/772992/aqua-marine-supply-v-aim-machining-inc-doing-business-as-richardson/\"><span class=\"volume\">247</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1216</span></a></span>, 1219-20 (Fed.Cir.2001) (concluding that in a patent infringement action an appeal is moot when the appellee no longer has an interest in defending the judgment of invalidity that it obtained below).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That is not the end of the matter. Shelby seeks vacation of the partial summary judgment order and, even though we must dismiss this appeal as moot, we retain jurisdiction to decide the question of vacatur. <i>U.S. Bancorp Mortg. Co. v. Bonner Mall P'ship,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117879\"><a href=\"/opinion/117879/us-bancorp-mortgage-co-v-bonner-mall-partnership/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 21, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117879\"><a href=\"/opinion/117879/us-bancorp-mortgage-co-v-bonner-mall-partnership/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">386</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117879\"><a href=\"/opinion/117879/us-bancorp-mortgage-co-v-bonner-mall-partnership/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">233</span></a></span> (1994). We turn to that question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"principal condition\" to which courts look when engaging the vacatur calculus is \"whether the party seeking relief from the judgment below caused the mootness by voluntary action.\" <i>Id.</i> at 24, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117879\"><a href=\"/opinion/117879/us-bancorp-mortgage-co-v-bonner-mall-partnership/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">386</span></a></span>. Vacatur is ordinarily appropriate when mootness results from vagarious circumstance or the unilateral act of the prevailing party. <i>Id.</i> at 25, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117879\"><a href=\"/opinion/117879/us-bancorp-mortgage-co-v-bonner-mall-partnership/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">386</span></a></span>. When mootness stems from a settlement, however, the presumption is different. In that situation, \"the losing party has ... surrender[ed its] claim to the equitable remedy of vacatur. The judgment is not unreviewable, but simply unreviewed by [the losing party's] own choice.\" <i>Id.</i> The presumption, therefore, is that the judgment previously obtained should remain intact. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That presumption comes into play here. By entering a global settlement with Superformance, Shelby (the summary judgment loser) relinquished any claim to vacatur as of right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the <i>U.S. Bancorp</i> presumptions are not ironclad, and exceptional circumstances may justify different results. <i>See id.</i> at 29, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117879\"><a href=\"/opinion/117879/us-bancorp-mortgage-co-v-bonner-mall-partnership/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">386</span></a></span>. In this instance, Shelby maintains that the presumption against vacatur is rebutted by the equities. In elaboration, it first contends that allowing the summary judgment to stand will have an institutionally detrimental impact because the district court's holding is in conflict with trade-dress law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That is resupinate reasoning. It invites us to reach the merits of the order in question and adopt the settling party's unopposed view of them. That disingenuous invitation seriously distorts the <i>U.S. Bancorp</i> standard, and we decline to accept it. <i>See Aqua Marine,</i> 247 F.3d at 1221.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shelby also argues that the terms of the settlement agreement preserve its right to appeal from the district court's summary judgment order. Because Shelby has not produced the settlement agreement, that argument asks us to take on faith a matter dehors the record. In all events, even if Shelby's depiction of the settlement is accurate, the reservation of a right of appeal does not constitute an exceptional circumstance sufficient to justify vacation of an underlying judgment. After all, if the \"fact that the settlement agreement provides for vacatur\" does not constitute an exceptional circumstance, <i>U.S. Bancorp,</i> 513 U.S. at 29, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117879\"><a href=\"/opinion/117879/us-bancorp-mortgage-co-v-bonner-mall-partnership/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">386</span></a></span>, the fact that the agreement includes a right of appeal cannot conceivably be entitled to greater deference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If more were needed &#8212; and we are confident that it is not &#8212; we emphasize that vacatur is an equitable remedy. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> at 25, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117879\"><a href=\"/opinion/117879/us-bancorp-mortgage-co-v-bonner-mall-partnership/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">386</span></a></span>. In constructing that balance, Shelby's actions weigh heavily against it. As recounted above, Shelby omitted any mention of its unsuccessful motion to vacate the summary judgment order in its appellate filings, effectively obscured the import of the settlement agreement in those filings, and never acknowledged that the issue of mootness hovered like a dark cloud over this appeal. Courts ought not to reward a party's evasiveness by granting it relief that it does not deserve. We will not do so here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> For the reasons elucidated above, we dismiss this appeal as moot and leave intact the district court's partial summary judgment order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Dismissed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> A rolling chassis is essentially a car body without an engine or a transmission</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Ford Motor Co., which had partnered with Shelby in the original venture, later intervened as a plaintiff in this action, alleging its own trademark claims against Superformance. Since Ford is not a party to this appeal, the evolution of those claims need not be traced here</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Shelby's appellate brief contains nary a syllable about the district court's denial of the motion to vacate, nor does it confront the issue of mootness. It took direct questioning by this court to elicit Shelby's views about mootness and the related issue of vacatur. That will not do: on appeal, \"a litigant has an obligation to spell out its arguments squarely and distinctly, or else forever hold its peace.\"<i>United States v.
