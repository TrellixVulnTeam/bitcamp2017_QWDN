This case raises a new issue of\n\ninterpretation of a 1997 immigration provision, the Nicaraguan\n\nAdjustment and Central American Relief Act (NACARA) § 203(a), Pub.\n\nL. No. 105-100, 111 Stat. 2160, 2196 (1997).                NACARA § 203(a)\n\namended and clarified a provision of a major immigration statute,\n\nthe Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of\n\n1996 (IIRIRA), Pub. L. No. 104-208, Div. C, 110 Stat. 3009, 3009-\n\n546 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 5, 8, 18, 28, 42,\n\n& 48 U.S.C.).\n\n              The two provisions concern the concept of an alien's\n\n\"continuous residence\" and \"continuous physical presence\" in the\n\nUnited    States.        Continuous   presence   and/or    residence    for   a\n\nspecified period of years are basic eligibility requirements for\n\ncertain   types     of   discretionary      immigration   relief,    including\n\nsuspension of deportation and cancellation of removal.                  See 8\n\nU.S.C.    §   1229b(a),     (b)(1),   (d).      Accrual   of   the   requisite\n\ncontinuous time, however, can be broken without the alien actually\n\nleaving the country.         Under 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(d)(1), an alien's\n\npresence and residence are deemed ended in two circumstances: when\n\nhe or she has been served a notice to appear, id. § 1229b(d)(1)(A),\n\nor committed certain criminal offenses, id. § 1229b(d)(1)(B).\n\nThese provisions are collectively known as the \"stop-time rule.\"\n\nThe question presented concerns the temporal reach of subsection\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f(B) of the stop-time rule, the provision relating to criminal\n\noffenses.\n\n            The petitioner, Dr. Rubén Peralta, works as a trauma\n\nsurgeon at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. More than\n\na decade ago, he committed a crime, marriage fraud, which an\n\nImmigration Judge (IJ) determined fell within the universe of\n\noffenses listed in subsection (B).          The IJ found that subsection\n\n(B), which took effect after Dr. Peralta committed the crime and\n\nafter his deportation proceedings had begun, was retroactively\n\napplicable    under   the   transitional    rules    of   IIRIRA.    The   IJ\n\ntherefore     found   Dr.   Peralta     ineligible    for    suspension    of\n\ndeportation1 and pretermitted his application for that relief.2 The\n\nBoard of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed.\n\n            On petition for review, Dr. Peralta argues that while\n\nIIRIRA's transitional rules may make subsection (A) retroactively\n\napplicable, they are silent as to subsection (B).            He argues that\n\ngiven   the   existence     of   a   separate   provision     that   renders\n\n\n1\n   Suspension of deportation was abolished in 1997 and replaced by\na new discretionary form of relief, cancellation of removal. See\n8 U.S.C. § 1229b.        However, aliens placed in deportation\nproceedings before April 1, 1997, as Dr. Peralta was, remained\neligible to apply for suspension of deportation.            IIRIRA\n§ 309(c)(1), 110 Stat. at 3009-625.      The statutory scheme is\ndiscussed in more detail below.\n2\n  \"An application is pretermitted when disqualified for failure to\nmeet the threshold eligibility requirement that an alien have\nresided in the United States for a sufficient period of time to\nobtain the discretionary relief of suspension of deportation.\"\nAfful v. Ashcroft, 380 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                                      -3-\n\fprospective      the   application    of     IIRIRA   except    where    Congress\n\nspecifies to the contrary, this silence as to subsection (B) should\n\nbe read as a clear congressional mandate that subsection (B) be\n\napplied only prospectively.         Alternatively, he argues, the silence\n\nconstitutes an ambiguity that we should interpret in his favor to\n\navoid giving the statute impermissible retroactive effect.\n\n            We    reject     Dr.   Peralta's    reading   of    the     statutory\n\nlanguage.    We find that IIRIRA's transitional rules (as amended by\n\nNACARA) clearly render subsection (B) retroactively applicable.\n\nThis means his marriage fraud offense stopped his accrual of time,\n\nand so he was not eligible for the relief he sought.               The BIA and\n\nIJ were correct.       We deny Dr. Peralta's petition for review.\n\n                                       I.\n\n            Dr. Peralta, a native and citizen of the Dominican\n\nRepublic, entered the United States on April 26, 1986 as a visitor.\n\nOn October 25, 1990, he married Patricia Lemonds, a United States\n\ncitizen. Based on that marriage, he adjusted his status on January\n\n23, 1991, to that of an alien admitted for conditional permanent\n\nresidence.       On November 4, 1992, Dr. Peralta and Lemonds jointly\n\nfiled an application to remove the conditions on his residency.\n\nSoon   after,     however,    investigators      from   the    Immigration   and\n\nNaturalization Service (INS)3 discovered that the marriage was a\n\n\n3\n   On March 1, 2003, the INS ceased to exist and its principal\nfunctions were transferred to the Bureau of Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement in the Department of Homeland Security. See Homeland\n\n                                       -4-\n\fsham:   It   had   been    arranged   by    a   New   Jersey   attorney,   David\n\nBiederman,     and   a     Chicago    immigration       consultant,   Marshall\n\nSchoeneman,    for   the    express   purpose     of   procuring   immigration\n\nbenefits for Dr. Peralta.        Investigators determined that Lemonds\n\nhad been promised $1,000 for her cooperation, with $500 due before\n\nthe marriage and $500 after the divorce.               The investigators also\n\ndetermined that Lemonds' signature had been forged on the November\n\n4, 1992 application to remove the conditions on Dr. Peralta's\n\nresidency.     Further, the IJ found, Lemonds was a drug addict and\n\n\"was supplied with cocaine in order to secure her participation.\"\n\n             In 1994, the INS notified Dr. Peralta of its intent to\n\nterminate his immigration status; the termination became effective\n\nSeptember 19, 1995.        Dr. Peralta also faced criminal prosecution:\n\nHe and eleven other aliens were among twenty-seven people charged\n\nin a marriage fraud scheme run by Biederman and Schoeneman.                  On\n\nOctober 4, 1995, Dr. Peralta pled guilty to violating former 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1325(b) (1994) (now codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1325(c)), which\n\nforbids knowingly marrying for the purpose of evading immigration\n\nlaws.   His conviction was entered January 2, 1996.             The judgment of\n\nconviction stated that his offense concluded on October 20, 1992.\n\n\n\n\nSecurity Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, § 471, 116 Stat. 2135,\n2205 (codified as amended at 6 U.S.C. § 291(a)).\n\n                                      -5-\n\f               On March 14, 1997, the INS issued Dr. Peralta an order to\n\nshow cause4 charging him with deportability as an alien whose\n\nconditional resident status had been terminated, and as an alien\n\nwho fraudulently entered a marital agreement for the purpose of\n\nentering the United States.               Those papers were filed with the\n\nimmigration court on March 27, 1997. Since proceedings against Dr.\n\nPeralta commenced prior to April 1, 1997, the transitional rules of\n\nIIRIRA apply to his case.            See Afful v. Ashcroft, 380 F.3d 1, 6\n\n(1st Cir. 2004).\n\n               Dr. Peralta denied that he was deportable.                        In the\n\nalternative,         he   sought   relief    in    the     form   of     suspension   of\n\ndeportation.         He submitted his suspension application on May 7,\n\n1999.\n\n               Dr.    Peralta's     hearing       before    the     IJ    was    delayed\n\nrepeatedly, for reasons not relevant here.                    Finally, on July 31,\n\n2003, an IJ found him deportable as charged.                 On December 8 of that\n\nyear,    the    IJ    pretermitted     the      application       for    suspension   of\n\ndeportation, ruling that Dr. Peralta was ineligible for the relief\n\nbecause of the stop-time effect of subsection (B) of 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1229b(d)(1).        The BIA affirmed on April 14, 2005.                Dr. Peralta's\n\nsole    contention        on   petition   for     review    is    that    the   agency's\n\ninterpretation of subsection (B) was error, that he is eligible for\n\n\n\n4\n   The order to show cause was the pre-IIRIRA predecessor of the\nnotice to appear.\n\n                                          -6-\n\fconsideration    for    suspension     of   deportation       (now   known     as\n\ncancellation    of   removal),   and    that   his    application    for     such\n\nsuspension of deportation should be heard on the merits.\n\n                                     II.\n\nA.        The Statutory Framework\n\n          Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) as it\n\nexisted prior to 1997, aliens ordered removed from the United\n\nStates could apply to the Attorney General for suspension of\n\ndeportation.    This discretionary relief was available to an alien\n\nwho could show, inter alia, that he or she had \"been physically\n\npresent in the United States for a continuous period of not less\n\nthan   seven    years   immediately     preceding      the    date    of     such\n\napplication\" and that \"during all of such period he was and is a\n\nperson of good moral character.\"        8 U.S.C. § 1254(a) (1994).\n\n          In    1996,    however,      Congress      passed   IIRIRA,      which\n\neliminated suspension of deportation and replaced it, effective\n\nApril 1, 1997, with a procedure called cancellation of removal.\n\nIIRIRA § 304(a)(3), 110 Stat. at 3009-582 (codified at 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1229b(b)(1)) (replacing INA § 244 with a new § 240A); see also\n\nCosta v. INS, 233 F.3d 31, 32-33 (1st Cir. 1999).                    Among its\n\nrequirements, the new cancellation of removal framework delineated\n\na set of circumstances in which an alien's \"continuous residence or\n\nphysical presence\" in the United States would be deemed terminated:\n\n          (d) Special rules relating to                continuous\n          residence or physical presence.\n\n                                     -7-\n\f                (1) Termination of continuous period. For\n             purposes of this section, any period of\n             continuous residence or continuous physical\n             presence in the United States shall be deemed\n             to end\n                     (A) . . . when the alien is served a\n             notice to appear under [8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)],\n             or\n                     (B) when the alien has committed an\n             offense referred to in [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)]\n             that renders the alien inadmissible to the\n             United States under [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)] or\n             removable from the United States under [8\n             U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2) or (a)(4)], whichever is\n             earliest.\n\n                (2)   Treatment   of   certain  breaks   in\n             presence.   An alien shall be considered to\n             have failed to maintain continuous physical\n             presence   in   the    United   States   under\n             subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2) if the alien has\n             departed from the United States for any period\n             in excess of 90 days or for any periods in the\n             aggregate exceeding 180 days.\n\n             . . . .\n\n8   U.S.C.    §     1229b(d).      The        first    of   these     subsections,\n\n§ 1229b(d)(1), is commonly referred to as the \"stop-time rule.\"\n\nThe second, § 1229b(d)(2), is known as the \"90/180 rule.\"\n\n             In    order   to   comprehend      the    present      dispute,    some\n\nunderstanding of the retroactivity provisions of two pieces of\n\nprior legislation is needed. Under the terms of IIRIRA, suspension\n\nof deportation remained available to aliens who had been placed in\n\ndeportation       proceedings   prior    to    April   1,   1997.      See     IIRIRA\n\n§ 309(c)(1), 110 Stat. at 3009-625. However, the suspension remedy\n\nwas altered, even as to that class of aliens.                    Under IIRIRA's\n\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\ftransitional rules, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(d) was given retroactive effect:\n\n           TRANSITIONAL RULE WITH REGARD TO SUSPENSION OF\n           DEPORTATION. -- Paragraphs (1) and (2) of\n           section 240A(d) of the Immigration and\n           Nationality   Act  (relating   to   continuous\n           residence or physical presence) shall apply to\n           notices to appear issued before, on, or after\n           the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\nIIRIRA § 309(c)(5), 110 Stat. at 3009-627.\n\n           The wording of these provisions quickly led to problems.\n\nBy their terms, they applied to \"notices to appear.\"                  However,\n\nbefore enactment of IIRIRA, notices to appear did not exist; aliens\n\nat that time instead were served with \"orders to show cause.\"            This\n\ndiscrepancy left aliens already in proceedings before April 1,\n\n1997,   with   room   to   argue   that    under   the   terms   of    IIRIRA\n\n§ 309(c)(5), subsection (A) of the stop-time rule did not apply to\n\nthem.\n\n           This argument was foreclosed in 1997, when Congress\n\nretroactively    amended    IIRIRA     §   309(c)(5)     to   address      the\n\ndiscrepancy.    In relevant part, the amended provision reads as\n\nfollows:\n\n           (5)   TRANSITIONAL   RULES  WITH   REGARD   TO\n           SUSPENSION OF DEPORTATION. -- (A) IN GENERAL.\n           -- Subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C),\n           paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 240A(d) of\n           the Immigration and Nationality Act (relating\n           to continuous residence or physical presence)\n           shall apply to orders to show cause (including\n           those referred to in section 242B(a)(1) of the\n           Immigration and Nationality Act, as in effect\n           before the title III-A effective date), issued\n           before, on, or after the date of the enactment\n           of this Act.\n\n                                     -9-\n\fNACARA § 203(a)(1) (emphasis added).\n\n           In interpreting NACARA, this circuit, and every other\n\ncircuit to address the question, concluded \"that the stop-time rule\n\napplies retroactively to orders to show cause issued prior to the\n\nenactment of the IIRIRA.\" Afful, 380 F.3d at 7 (collecting cases).\n\nThese holdings came in cases dealing with subsection (A) -- cases,\n\nin other words, where the question was whether the issuance of an\n\norder to show cause prior to IIRIRA's effective date cut off the\n\naccrual of continuous presence or residence.       See, e.g., Suassuna\n\nv. INS, 342 F.3d 578 (6th Cir. 2003); Ram v. INS, 243 F.3d 510 (9th\n\nCir. 2001); Pinho v. INS, 249 F.3d 183 (3d Cir. 2001).          The cases\n\ndid not address the separate question of whether subsection (B)\n\napplied retroactively to cut off an alien's accrual of time at the\n\nmoment, pre-IIRIRA, when that alien \"committed an offense referred\n\nto in\" 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2).      That is the question we address.\n\nB.         The Agency Decisions\n\n           The IJ did not discuss any possible distinction between\n\nthe   retroactivity   of   the   separate   subsections   (A)   and   (B).\n\nInstead, she asserted as a general matter that \"the stop-time rules\n\ndo, in fact, apply retroactively,\" and then applied subsection (B)\n\nto Dr. Peralta's claim.\n\n           Specifically, the IJ found that Dr. Peralta's violation\n\nof the marriage fraud statute began on November 19, 1990, when, one\n\nmonth after his \"marriage\" to Lemonds, he filed adjustment-of-\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fstatus documents with the INS and swore to the veracity of their\n\ncontents.    The IJ concluded he lacked good moral character, at\n\nleast during the period the fraud was ongoing.       The IJ made an\n\nadditional finding that Dr. Peralta's crime was one of \"moral\n\nturpitude\" within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2):\n\n            The so-called spouse . . . in this case, a\n            person who was a drug addict at the time, was\n            supplied with cocaine in order to secure her\n            participation. . . . The Court notes, in any\n            event, that at its minimum, the essential\n            elements of this crime are that the respondent\n            intended to fraudulently obtain immigration\n            benefits. And the Court deems it inescapable\n            that   this  is   a  crime   involving   moral\n            turpitude.\n\n            The IJ then applied subsection (B). Since that provision\n\ncuts off an alien's accrual of time \"when the alien has committed\n\nan offense referred to in\" 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2), the IJ found that\n\nDr. Peralta's presence ended on November 19, 1990.           Since Dr.\n\nPeralta had only been in the United States for four years as of\n\n1990, and since the IJ interpreted IIRIRA as barring any re-start\n\nof the continuous presence/residence clock once the stop-time rule\n\nhad been triggered,5 the IJ held that Dr. Peralta could not show\n\nthat he had \"been physically present in the United States for a\n\ncontinuous period of not less than seven years,\" as required by the\n\nsuspension of deportation statute.     See 8 U.S.C. § 1254(a) (1994).\n\n\n\n\n5\n   This interpretation, implicitly affirmed by the BIA, is not\nchallenged by Dr. Peralta on petition for review.\n\n                                -11-\n\f          The BIA affirmed, noting that it had previously held (1)\n\nthat the stop-time rule \"applies to applications for suspension of\n\ndeportation\" and (2) that the stop-time rule \"operates to terminate\n\nthe period of continuous physical presence as of the date that an\n\nalien commits an offense that renders him inadmissible under\" 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1182(a)(2).   Combining these two propositions, the BIA\n\nheld that subsection (B) must have retroactive effect.   It applied\n\nsubsection (B) and found that \"because the respondent last entered\n\n[the United States] on April 26, 1986, and the record reflects that\n\nhe concluded the offense of marriage fraud on October 20, 1992,\n\nless than 7 years later, the respondent did not have the requisite\n\ncontinuous physical presence to be eligible for suspension of\n\ndeportation.\"6\n\n                               III.\n\n          Dr. Peralta argues that the BIA's reading of subsection\n\n(B) is forbidden by rules of statutory construction, particularly\n\nretroactivity rules.\n\n\n\n\n6\n   The BIA also addressed an argument by Dr. Peralta that he had\nrelied on his potential eligibility for suspension of deportation\nwhen he pled guilty to a crime, and therefore under INS v. St. Cyr,\n533 U.S. 289 (2001), the stop-time rule could not be retroactively\napplied.   The BIA found that at the time he pled guilty, Dr.\nPeralta lacked sufficient accrued good moral character time to be\neligible for suspension of deportation, and so he could not have\nrelied on its availability. As we explain in Part III, we do not\nreach these issues, which properly arise only in the second step of\nthe retroactivity inquiry required by Landgraf v. USI Film Prods.,\n511 U.S. 244 (1994).\n\n                               -12-\n\f            \"Despite the dangers inherent in retroactive legislation,\n\nit is beyond dispute that, within constitutional limits, Congress\n\nhas the power to enact laws with retrospective effect.\"                 INS v. St.\n\nCyr, 533 U.S. 289, 316 (2001).           However, \"[a] statute may not be\n\napplied retroactively . . . absent a clear indication from Congress\n\nthat it intended such a result.\"         Id.     This is because \"[r]equiring\n\nclear    intent   assures    that     Congress    itself    has   affirmatively\n\nconsidered the potential unfairness of retroactive application and\n\ndetermined    that   it     is   an   acceptable    price    to   pay    for   the\n\ncountervailing benefits.\"         Landgraf v. USI Film Prods., 511 U.S.\n\n244, 272-73 (1994).\n\n            In Landgraf, the Supreme Court laid out a two-part test\n\nfor assessing whether a statute should be retroactively applied.\n\nFirst, the court must \"determine whether Congress has expressly\n\nprescribed the statute's proper reach.\"               Id. at 280.         If this\n\ninquiry \"leads to a firm conviction that Congress intended the\n\nstatute to have a specific temporal reach, the retroactivity\n\nanalysis ends\"; we then apply the statute in accordance with\n\nCongress' command.        Lattab v. Ashcroft, 384 F.3d 8, 14 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).   The Supreme Court has said that the standard for finding an\n\nexpress congressional command, and thus ending the inquiry at the\n\nfirst stage, \"is a demanding one.\"               St. Cyr, 533 U.S. at 316.\n\n\"Cases where this Court has found truly 'retroactive' effect\n\nadequately authorized by statute have involved statutory language\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\fthat was so clear that it could sustain only one interpretation.\"\n\nId. at 316-17 (quoting Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U.S. 320, 328 n.4\n\n(1997)).       Nevertheless,          \"our    inquiry       is   not    limited    to   the\n\nstatutory text but may include an examination of standard ensigns\n\nof statutory construction, such as the statute's structure and\n\nlegislative history.\"               Lattab, 384 F.3d at 14 (citing Martin v.\n\nHadix, 527 U.S. 343, 355-57 (1999)).\n\n            If    we    find    no    express       command      as   to   the   statute's\n\ntemporal reach, we must engage the second step of the Landgraf\n\ntest, determining \"whether the new statute would have retroactive\n\neffect, i.e., whether it would impair rights a party possessed when\n\nhe acted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose\n\nnew   duties     with    respect       to    transactions         already    completed.\"\n\nLandgraf,   511    U.S.        at    280.      \"If    the     statute      would   operate\n\nretroactively, [the] traditional presumption teaches that it does\n\nnot govern absent clear congressional intent favoring such a\n\nresult.\"    Id.\n\nA.          Dr. Peralta's Arguments\n\n            On petition for review, Dr. Peralta argues that the\n\nLandgraf test requires reversal.\n\n            His primary argument is that Congress expressly commanded\n\nthat subsection (B) should have only prospective effect, and that\n\nwe need not reach step two of the Landgraf test in order to deem\n\nthe BIA's decision erroneous.                He begins with the language of the\n\n\n                                             -14-\n\ftwo    retroactivity   provisions,    IIRIRA   §   309(c)(5)   and    NACARA\n\n§ 203(a)(1).    Under IIRIRA § 309(c)(5), the stop-time rule \"shall\n\napply\" retroactively with respect to \"notices to appear.\"               110\n\nStat. at 3009-627.     Under NACARA § 203(a)(1), the stop-time rule\n\n\"shall apply\" retroactively with respect to \"orders to show cause.\"\n\n111 Stat. at 2196. Neither of these provisions, Dr. Peralta notes,\n\nsays the stop-time rule \"shall apply\" retroactively to certain\n\ncriminal offenses.     He argues that by their terms, the provisions\n\nrender retroactive only subsection (A), the portion of the stop-\n\ntime rule concerned with notices to appear.         Further, he says, the\n\nlack of any mention of \"offenses\" in the retroactivity provisions\n\nconstitutes not an ambiguity, but a clear statement by Congress\n\nthat   subsection   (B)   applies    prospectively.     This   is    because\n\nCongress mandated in IIRIRA that the changes made by that statute\n\n(and those made by NACARA § 203(a), which retroactively amends an\n\nIIRIRA provision) have only prospective effect except where it\n\nspecified to the contrary.     IIRIRA § 309(c)(1), 110 Stat. at 3009-\n\n625 (\"Subject to the succeeding provisions of this subsection, in\n\nthe case of an alien who is in exclusion or deportation proceedings\n\nas of the . . . effective date . . . the amendments made by this\n\nsubtitle shall not apply.\"); see also Afful, 380 F.3d at 7.\n\n            Alternatively, Dr. Peralta argues, if we conclude that\n\nthe retroactivity provisions are ambiguous, then under Landgraf's\n\nsecond step, application of the stop-time provision would have an\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\fimpermissible retroactive effect. He asserts that absent the stop-\n\ntime rule he would have had sufficient continuous presence to\n\nqualify for suspension of deportation, and while due to his crime\n\nhe did not have sufficient \"good moral character\" time either when\n\nhe pled guilty or when his deportation proceedings began, he could\n\nhave continued accruing such time throughout the pendency of his\n\nproceedings.   Dr. Peralta argues that \"[h]e would . . . have known\n\nthat he retained the possibility of qualifying for relief.\"   This\n\npotential future eligibility for relief is the right he says he\n\n\"possessed when he acted\" that would be impaired by application of\n\nthe stop-time rule.   Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 280.\n\nB.        Analysis\n\n          Reading the relevant statutory provisions as a whole, we\n\nhold that Congress has expressly mandated that subsection (B) be\n\napplied retroactively.   We do not reach the second stage of the\n\nLandgraf test.\n\n          The key to our analysis is the fact that the relevant\n\nprovisions, IIRIRA § 309(c)(5) and NACARA § 203(a)(1), purport to\n\nrender retroactive, to at least some extent, \"paragraphs (1) and\n\n(2)\" of 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(d) (emphasis added).   Paragraph (2), the\n\n90/180 rule, has nothing to do with the issuance of orders to show\n\ncause or notices to appear; it deals instead with breaks in\n\ncontinuous presence via actual departure from the country.\n\n\n\n\n                               -16-\n\f               This    dooms    Dr.   Peralta's         statutory      interpretation\n\nargument.       His position, boiled down to its essence, is that when\n\nthe    two     provisions       say   that    §    1229b(d)(1)         \"shall     apply\"\n\nretroactively to \"orders to show cause\" and \"notices to appear,\"\n\nthey mean that only the section of § 1229b(d)(1) that actually\n\nmentions such orders and notices -- subsection (A) -- is rendered\n\nretroactive.      If that were so for § 1229b(d)(1), however, it would\n\nalso necessarily be so for § 1229b(d)(2).                      That would mean the\n\nreferences to paragraph (2) in IIRIRA § 309(c)(5) and NACARA\n\n§ 203(a)(1) would be read out of the statutory text; paragraph (2)\n\nwould never be retroactive under any circumstances, since it\n\ncontains no mention of notices to appear or orders to show cause.\n\n\"In    construing      a   statute    we   are    obliged      to   give     effect,   if\n\npossible, to every word Congress used.\"                  Rutanen v. Baylis (In re\n\nBaylis), 313 F.3d 9, 20 (1st Cir. 2002) (quoting Reiter v. Sonotone\n\nCorp., 442 U.S. 330, 339 (1979)).\n\n               In our own analysis, we start with the fact that the two\n\nprovisions, IIRIRA § 309(c)(5) and NACARA § 203(a)(1), purport to\n\nhave    some    effect     on   \"paragraphs       (1)    and    (2)\"    of    8   U.S.C.\n\n§ 1229b(d).           These two paragraphs create three fundamentally\n\ndifferent triggering events, each of which cuts off the accrual of\n\nan alien's continuous presence and residence. The first trigger is\n\nissuance of an order to show cause or notice to appear; the second\n\nis commission of a specified crime; the third is actual departure\n\n\n                                           -17-\n\ffrom the country. Because of the \"paragraph (1) and (2)\" language,\n\nIIRIRA § 309(c)(5) and NACARA § 203(a)(1) must be read to render\n\nretroactive at least one of the triggers in each paragraph.                    Given\n\nthat,   we   see    only   one    feasible      conclusion:    that   the    phrases\n\n\"notices to appear\" and \"orders to show cause\" function in this\n\ncontext as a shorthand for \"cases.\"               In other words, when IIRIRA\n\n§ 309(c)(5) and NACARA § 203(a)(1) say that the stop-time rule and\n\nthe 90/180 rule \"shall apply\" to notices to appear and orders to\n\nshow cause \"issued before, on, or after the date of the enactment\n\nof this Act,\" they mean that the two rules are fully applicable,\n\nregardless of when an alien's proceedings commenced.                        No other\n\nconstruction       would   give    any    effect    to   the    two   provisions'\n\nreferences to paragraph (2).7\n\n             Dr. Peralta argues that this interpretation involves\n\nimpermissibly \"read[ing] unwritten language in to Congressional\n\n\n7\n   A lay person might reasonably wonder why, if Dr. Peralta has\nalready been found once by the IJ to lack good moral character and\nto have committed a crime of moral turpitude, he should be given a\nchance to apply for suspension of deportation, wherein he must show\ngood moral character. Dr. Peralta argues that his moral character\nwould be evaluated at the time the question would be reached at a\nhearing on his suspension of deportation request, not as of the\ndate in 1997 when he was placed in deportation proceedings, and\nthat he has worked very hard since he committed a crime to restore\nhis good moral character -- indeed, that he relied on his ability\nto do so and so had a reliance interest. He points out that his\nmedical expertise has been used for the benefit of the public, and\nto the many letters of support for him. Whatever merit there is to\nthis argument, however, it cannot alter the outcome because Dr.\nPeralta is statutorily ineligible for suspension of deportation\nbased on his lack of continuous presence.        We rest on this\nlogically prior ground.\n\n                                         -18-\n\ftext.\"   But our reading does no such thing.        At least one circuit\n\nhas taken the same approach as we do, applying subsection (B)\n\nretroactively, though without extended discussion.            See Okeke v.\n\nGonzales,   407   F.3d   585,    588   (3d   Cir.   2005)    (finding   that\n\npetitioner's \"commission of a controlled substance offense in 1983\n\n. . . triggered the 'stop-time' provision,\" but remanding to the\n\nBIA on other grounds). Several more circuits have reached the same\n\nconclusion in the context of the 90/180 rule. See Mendiola-Sanchez\n\nv. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 937, 939-41 (9th Cir. 2004) (concluding that\n\nthe   IIRIRA   and   NACARA     provisions    render   the    90/180    rule\n\nretroactive); Rivera-Jimenez v. INS, 214 F.3d 1213, 1218 (10th Cir.\n\n2000) (per curiam) (same); see also Tapia v. Ashcroft, 351 F.3d\n\n795, 798-99 (7th Cir. 2003) (applying 90/180 rule retroactively).\n\nWe have found no cases holding to the contrary.8             And while our\n\nholding rests on the statutory text, it is entirely consistent with\n\nthe legislative history.9\n\n\n8\n   Dr. Peralta argued in his reply brief that a Fifth Circuit case\nadopted his reading of the statutory language.      However, that\nopinion has since been withdrawn, see Gonzalez-Garcia v. Gonzales,\n2005 WL 3047411 (5th Cir. Nov. 15, 2005), and the unpublished\ndecision that replaced it includes no discussion of the stop-time\nrule's retroactivity, see Gonzales-Garcia v. Gonzales, 2006 WL\n346298 (5th Cir. Feb. 14, 2006).\n9\n   In addition to his textual arguments, Dr. Peralta posits that\nthe legislative history supports his position. First, he notes\nthat a House report on the bill that eventually became IIRIRA\noffers a rationale for making subsection (A) retroactive -- to\nprevent aliens from delaying their proceedings to accrue more\ncontinuous presence -- and no rationale that would go to the\nretroactivity of subsection (B). See H.R. Rep. No. 104-469, pt.\n\n                                   -19-\n\f                               IV.\n\n          Dr. Peralta has raised no other challenges to the BIA\n\ndecision, and so we go no further.    The petition for review is\n\ndenied.\n\n\n\n\n1, at 122 (1996). But this is to be expected, because at the time\nof the report, the future § 1229d(1) contained only the notice-to-\nappear stop-time rule; the criminal-offense portion had not yet\nbeen added. Id. at 24. Dr. Peralta also quotes a Senate committee\nmemorandum that explained NACARA § 203(a)(1) and made no reference\nto criminal offenses. See 143 Cong. Rec. S12266 (daily ed. Nov. 9,\n1997). But as we have said, Congress enacted NACARA § 203(a)(1)\nspecifically to foreclose the argument that IIRIRA § 309(c)(5)'s\nuse of the term \"notice to appear\" meant subsection (A) had only\nprospective effect. Afful, 380 F.3d at 7. It is hardly surprising\nthat the memorandum would not mention subsection (B) in explaining\nsuch an amendment.\n\n                              -20-\n\f",

No. 105-100, 111 Stat. 2160, 2196 (1997). NACARA &#167; 203(a) amended and clarified a provision of a major immigration statute, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), Pub.L. No. 104-208, Div. C, 110 Stat. 3009, 3009-546 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 5, 8, 18, 28, 42, &amp; 48 U.S.C.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two provisions concern the concept of an alien's \"continuous residence\" and \"continuous physical presence\" in the United States. Continuous presence and/or residence for a specified period of years are basic eligibility requirements for certain types of discretionary immigration relief, including suspension of deportation and cancellation of removal. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229b(a), (b)(1), (d). Accrual of the requisite continuous time, however, can be broken without the alien actually leaving the country. Under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229b(d)(1), an alien's presence and residence are deemed ended in two circumstances: when he or she has been served a notice to appear, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1229b(d)(1)(A), or committed certain criminal offenses, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1229b(d)(1)(B).

More than a decade ago, he committed a crime, marriage fraud, which an Immigration Judge (IJ) determined fell within the universe of offenses listed in subsection (B). The IJ found that subsection (B), which took effect after Dr. Peralta committed the crime and after his deportation proceedings had begun, was retroactively applicable under the transitional rules of IIRIRA. The IJ therefore found Dr. Peralta ineligible for suspension of deportation<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and pretermitted his application for that relief.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On petition for review, Dr. Peralta argues that while IIRIRA's transitional rules may make subsection (A) retroactively applicable, they are silent as to subsection (B).

On October 25, 1990, he married Patricia Lemonds, a United States citizen. Based on that marriage, he adjusted his status on January 23, 1991, to that of an alien admitted for conditional permanent residence. On November 4, 1992, Dr. Peralta and Lemonds jointly filed an application to remove the conditions on his residency. Soon after, however, investigators from the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> discovered that the marriage was a sham: It had been arranged by a New Jersey attorney, David Biederman, and a Chicago immigration consultant, Marshall Schoeneman, for the express purpose of procuring immigration benefits for Dr. Peralta. Investigators determined that Lemonds had been promised $1,000 for her cooperation, with $500 due before the marriage and $500 after the divorce. The investigators also determined that Lemonds' signature had been forged on the November 4, 1992 application to remove the conditions on Dr. Peralta's residency. Further, the IJ found, Lemonds was a drug addict and \"was supplied with cocaine in order to secure her participation.\" In 1994, the INS notified Dr. Peralta of its intent to terminate his immigration status; the termination became effective September 19, 1995. Dr. Peralta also faced criminal prosecution: He and eleven other aliens were among twenty-seven people charged in a marriage fraud scheme run by Biederman and Schoeneman. On October 4, 1995, Dr. Peralta pled guilty to violating former 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1325(b) (1994) (now codified at 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1325(c)), which forbids knowingly marrying for the purpose of evading immigration laws. His conviction was entered January 2, 1996. The judgment of conviction stated that his offense concluded on October 20, 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 14, 1997, the INS issued Dr. Peralta an order to show cause<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> charging him with deportability as an alien whose conditional resident status had been terminated, and as an alien who fraudulently entered a marital agreement for the purpose of entering the United States. Those papers were filed with the immigration court on March 27, 1997. Since proceedings against Dr. Peralta commenced prior to April 1, 1997, the transitional rules of IIRIRA apply to his case. <i>See Afful v. Ashcroft,</i> 380 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Peralta denied that he was deportable. In the alternative, he sought relief in the form of suspension of deportation. He submitted his suspension application on May 7, 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Peralta's hearing before the IJ was delayed repeatedly, for reasons not relevant here. Finally, on July 31, 2003, an IJ found him deportable as charged. On December 8 of that year, the IJ pretermitted the application for suspension of deportation, ruling that Dr. Peralta was ineligible for the relief because of the stop-time effect of subsection (B) of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229b(d)(1). The BIA affirmed on April 14, 2005. Dr. Peralta's sole contention on petition for review is that the agency's interpretation of subsection (B) was error, that he is eligible for consideration for suspension of deportation (now known as cancellation of removal), and that his application for such suspension of deportation should be heard on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Statutory Framework</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) as it existed prior to 1997, aliens ordered removed from the United States could apply to the Attorney General for suspension of deportation. This discretionary relief was available to an alien who could show, inter alia, that he or she had \"been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of not less than seven years immediately preceding the date of such application\" and that \"during all of such period he was and is a person of good moral character.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1254(a) (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1996, however, Congress passed IIRIRA, which eliminated suspension of deportation and replaced it, effective April 1, 1997, with a procedure called cancellation of removal. IIRIRA &#167; 304(a)(3), 110 Stat. at 3009-582 (codified at 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229b(b)(1)) (replacing INA &#167; 244 with a new &#167; 240A); <i>see also Costa v. INS,</i> 233 F.3d 31, 32-33 (1st Cir.1999). Among its requirements, the new cancellation of removal framework delineated a set of circumstances in which an alien's \"continuous residence or physical presence\" in the United States would be deemed terminated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(d) Special rules relating to continuous residence or physical presence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) Termination of continuous period.

The first of these subsections, &#167; 1229b(d)(1), is commonly referred to as the \"stop-time rule.\" The second, &#167; 1229b(d)(2), is known as the \"90/180 rule.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to comprehend the present dispute, some understanding of the retroactivity provisions of two pieces of prior legislation is needed. Under the terms of IIRIRA, suspension of deportation remained available to aliens who had been placed in deportation proceedings prior to April 1, 1997. <i>See</i> IIRIRA &#167; 309(c)(1), 110 Stat. at 3009-625. However, the suspension remedy was altered, even as to that class of aliens. Under IIRIRA's transitional rules, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229b(d) was given retroactive effect:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">TRANSITIONAL RULE WITH REGARD TO SUSPENSION OF DEPORTATION.&#8212;Paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 240A(d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (relating to continuous residence or physical presence) shall apply to notices to appear issued before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IIRIRA &#167; 309(c)(5), 110 Stat. at 3009-627.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The wording of these provisions quickly led to problems. By their terms, they applied to \"notices to appear.\" However, before enactment of IIRIRA, notices to appear did not exist; aliens at that time instead were served with \"orders to show cause.\" This discrepancy left aliens already in proceedings before April 1, 1997, with room to argue that under the terms of IIRIRA &#167; 309(c)(5), subsection (A) of the stop-time rule did not apply to them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument was foreclosed in 1997, when Congress retroactively amended IIRIRA &#167; 309(c)(5) to address the discrepancy. In relevant part, the amended provision reads as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(5) TRANSITIONAL RULES WITH REGARD TO SUSPENSION OF DEPORTATION.&#8212;(A) IN GENERAL.&#8212;Subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C), paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 240A(d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (relating to continuous residence or physical presence) shall apply to <i>orders to show cause</i> (including those referred to in section 242B(a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as in effect before the title III-A effective date), issued before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">NACARA &#167; 203(a)(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In interpreting NACARA, this circuit, and every other circuit to address the question, concluded \"that the stop-time rule applies retroactively to orders to show cause issued prior to the enactment of the IIRIRA.\" <i>Afful,</i> 380 F.3d at 7 (collecting cases). These holdings came in cases dealing with subsection (A)&#8212;cases, in other words, where the question was whether the issuance of an order to show cause prior to IIRIRA's effective date cut off the accrual of continuous presence or residence. <i>See, e.g., Suassuna v. INS,</i> 342 F.3d 578 (6th Cir.2003); <i>Ram v. INS,</i> 243 F.3d 510 (9th Cir.2001); <i>Pinho v. INS,</i> 249 F.3d 183 (3d Cir.2001). The cases did not address the separate question of whether subsection (B) applied retroactively to cut off an alien's accrual of time at the moment, pre-IIRIRA, when that alien \"committed an offense referred to in\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(a)(2). That is the question we address.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The Agency Decisions</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ did not discuss any possible distinction between the retroactivity of the separate subsections (A) and (B). Instead, she asserted as a general matter that \"the stop-time rules do, in fact, apply retroactively,\" and then applied subsection (B) to Dr. Peralta's claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Specifically, the IJ found that Dr. Peralta's violation of the marriage fraud statute began on November 19, 1990, when, one month after his \"marriage\" to Lemonds, he filed adjustment-of-status documents with the INS and swore to the veracity of their contents. The IJ concluded he lacked good moral character, at least during the period the fraud was ongoing. The IJ made an additional finding that Dr. Peralta's crime was one of \"moral turpitude\" within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(a)(2):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The so-called spouse ... in this case, a person who was a drug addict at the time, was supplied with cocaine in order to secure her participation.... The Court notes, in any event, that at its minimum, the essential elements of this crime are that the respondent intended to fraudulently obtain immigration benefits. And the Court deems it inescapable that this is a crime involving moral turpitude.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ then applied subsection (B). Since that provision cuts off an alien's accrual of time \"when the alien has committed an offense referred to in\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(a)(2), the IJ found that Dr. Peralta's presence ended on November 19, 1990. Since Dr. Peralta had only been in the United States for four years as of 1990, and since the IJ interpreted IIRIRA as barring any re-start of the continuous presence/residence clock once the stop-time rule had been triggered,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> the IJ held that Dr. Peralta could not show that he had \"been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of not less than seven years,\" as required by the suspension of deportation statute. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1254(a) (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA affirmed, noting that it had previously held (1) that the stop-time rule \"applies to applications for suspension of deportation\" and (2) that the stop-time rule \"operates to terminate the period of continuous physical presence as of the date that an alien commits an offense that renders him inadmissible under\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(a)(2). Combining these two propositions, the BIA held that subsection (B) must have retroactive effect. It applied subsection (B) and found that \"because the respondent last entered [the United States] on April 26, 1986, and the record reflects that he concluded the offense of marriage fraud on October 20, 1992, less than 7 years later, the respondent did not have the requisite continuous physical presence to be eligible for suspension of deportation.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Peralta argues that the BIA's reading of subsection (B) is forbidden by rules of statutory construction, particularly retroactivity rules.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Despite the dangers inherent in retroactive legislation, it is beyond dispute that, within constitutional limits, Congress has the power to enact laws with retrospective effect.\" <i>INS v.

However, \"[a] statute may not be applied retroactively ... absent a clear indication from Congress that it intended such a result.\" <i>Id.</i> This is because \"[r]equiring clear intent assures that Congress itself has affirmatively considered the potential unfairness of retroactive application and determined that it is an acceptable price to pay for the countervailing benefits.\" <i>Landgraf v.

If this inquiry \"leads to a firm conviction that Congress intended the statute to have a specific temporal reach, the retroactivity analysis ends\"; we then apply the statute in accordance with Congress' command. <i>Lattab v. Ashcroft,</i> 384 F.3d 8, 14 (1st Cir.2004). The Supreme Court has said that the standard for finding an express congressional command, and thus ending the inquiry at the first stage, \"is a demanding one.\" <i>St. Cyr,</i> 533 U.S. at 316, 121 S.Ct. 2271. \"Cases where this Court has found truly `retroactive' effect adequately authorized by statute have involved statutory language that was so clear that it could sustain only one interpretation.\" <i>Id.</i> at 316-17, 121 S.Ct. 2271 (quoting <i>Lindh v. Murphy,</i> 521 U.S. 320, 328 n. 4, 117 S.Ct. 2059, 138 L.Ed.2d 481 (1997)). Nevertheless, \"our inquiry is not limited to the statutory text but may include an examination of standard ensigns of statutory construction, such as the statute's structure and legislative history.\" <i>Lattab,</i> 384 F.3d at 14 (citing <i>Martin v. Hadix,</i> 527 U.S. 343, 355-57, 119 S.Ct. 1998, 144 L.Ed.2d 347 (1999)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If we find no express command as to the statute's temporal reach, we must engage the second step of the <i>Landgraf</i> test, determining \"whether the new statute would have retroactive effect, <i>i.e.,</i> whether it would impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.\" <i>Landgraf,</i> 511 U.S. at 280, 114 S.Ct. 1483. \"If the statute would operate retroactively, [the] traditional presumption teaches that it does not govern absent clear congressional intent favoring such a result.\" <i>Id.</i> A. <i>Dr. Peralta's Arguments</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On petition for review, Dr. Peralta argues that the <i>Landgraf</i> test requires reversal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">His primary argument is that Congress expressly commanded that subsection (B) should have only prospective effect, and that we need not reach step two of the <i>Landgraf</i> test in order to deem the BIA's decision erroneous. He begins with the language of the two retroactivity provisions, IIRIRA &#167; 309(c)(5) and NACARA &#167; 203(a)(1). Under IIRIRA &#167; 309(c)(5), the stop-time rule \"shall apply\" retroactively with respect to \"notices to appear.\" 110 Stat. at 3009-627. Under NACARA &#167; 203(a)(1), the stop-time rule \"shall apply\" retroactively with respect to \"orders to show cause.\" 111 Stat. at 2196. Neither of these provisions, Dr. Peralta notes, says the stop-time rule \"shall apply\" retroactively to certain criminal offenses. He argues that by their terms, the provisions render retroactive only subsection (A), the portion of the stop-time rule concerned with notices to appear. Further, he says, the lack of any mention of \"offenses\" in the retroactivity provisions constitutes not an ambiguity, but a clear statement by Congress that subsection (B) applies prospectively. This is because Congress mandated in IIRIRA that the changes made by that statute (and those made by NACARA &#167; 203(a), which retroactively amends an IIRIRA provision) have only prospective effect except where it specified to the contrary. IIRIRA &#167; 309(c)(1), 110 Stat. at 3009-625 (\"Subject to the succeeding provisions of this subsection, in the case of an alien who is in exclusion or deportation proceedings as of the ... effective date... the amendments made by this subtitle shall not apply.\"); <i>see also Afful,</i> 380 F.3d at 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatively, Dr. Peralta argues, if we conclude that the retroactivity provisions are ambiguous, then under <i>Landgraf's</i> second step, application of the stop-time provision would have an impermissible retroactive effect. He asserts that absent the stop-time rule he would have had sufficient continuous presence to qualify for suspension of deportation, and while due to his crime he did not have sufficient \"good moral character\" time either when he pled guilty or when his deportation proceedings began, he could have continued accruing such time throughout the pendency of his proceedings. Dr. Peralta argues that \"[h]e would ... have known that he retained the possibility of qualifying for relief.\" This potential future eligibility for relief is the right he says he \"possessed when he acted\" that would be impaired by application of the stop-time rule. <i>Landgraf,</i> 511 U.S. at 280, 114 S.Ct. 1483.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Analysis</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reading the relevant statutory provisions as a whole, we hold that Congress has expressly mandated that subsection (B) be applied retroactively. We do not reach the second stage of the <i>Landgraf</i> test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The key to our analysis is the fact that the relevant provisions, IIRIRA &#167; 309(c)(5) and NACARA &#167; 203(a)(1), purport to render retroactive, to at least some extent, \"paragraphs (1) <i>and (2)</i>\" of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229b(d) (emphasis added). Paragraph (2), the 90/180 rule, has nothing to do with the issuance of orders to show cause or notices to appear; it deals instead with breaks in continuous presence via actual departure from the country.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This dooms Dr. Peralta's statutory interpretation argument. His position, boiled down to its essence, is that when the two provisions say that &#167; 1229b(d)(1) \"shall apply\" retroactively to \"orders to show cause\" and \"notices to appear,\" they mean that only the section of &#167; 1229b(d)(1) that actually mentions such orders and notices &#8212; subsection (A) &#8212; is rendered retroactive. If that were so for &#167; 1229b(d)(1), however, it would also necessarily be so for &#167; 1229b(d)(2). That would mean the references to paragraph (2) in IIRIRA &#167; 309(c)(5) and NACARA &#167; 203(a)(1) would be read out of the statutory text; paragraph (2) would never be retroactive under any circumstances, since it contains no mention of notices to appear or orders to show cause. \"In construing a statute we are obliged to give effect, if possible, to every word Congress used.\" <i>Rutanen v. Baylis</i> (<i>In re Baylis</i>), 313 F.3d 9, 20 (1st Cir. 2002) (quoting <i>Reiter v. Sonotone Corp.,</i> 442 U.S. 330, 339, 99 S.Ct. 2326, 60 L.Ed.2d 931 (1979)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our own analysis, we start with the fact that the two provisions, IIRIRA &#167; 309(c)(5) and NACARA &#167; 203(a)(1), purport to have some effect on \"paragraphs (1) and (2)\" of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229b(d). These two paragraphs create three fundamentally different triggering events, each of which cuts off the accrual of an alien's continuous presence and residence. The first trigger is issuance of an order to show cause or notice to appear; the second is commission of a specified crime; the third is actual departure from the country. Because of the \"paragraph (1) and (2)\" language, IIRIRA &#167; 309(c)(5) and NACARA &#167; 203(a)(1) must be read to render retroactive at least one of the triggers in each paragraph. Given that, we see only one feasible conclusion: that the phrases \"notices to appear\" and \"orders to show cause\" function in this context as a shorthand for \"cases.\" In other words, when IIRIRA &#167; 309(c)(5) and NACARA &#167; 203(a)(1) say that the stop-time rule and the 90/180 rule \"shall apply\" to notices to appear and orders to show cause \"issued before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this Act,\" they mean that the two rules are fully applicable, regardless of when an alien's proceedings commenced. No other construction would give any effect to the two provisions' references to paragraph (2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Peralta argues that this interpretation involves impermissibly \"read[ing] unwritten language in to Congressional text.\" But our reading does no such thing. At least one circuit has taken the same approach as we do, applying subsection (B) retroactively, though without extended discussion. <i>See Okeke v. Gonzales,</i> 407 F.3d 585, 588 (3d Cir. 2005) (finding that petitioner's \"commission of a controlled substance offense in 1983. . . triggered the `stop-time' provision,\" but remanding to the BIA on other grounds). Several more circuits have reached the same conclusion in the context of the 90/180 rule. <i>See Mendiola-Sanchez v. Ashcroft,</i> 381 F.3d 937, 939-41 (9th Cir. 2004) (concluding that the IIRIRA and NACARA provisions render the 90/180 rule retroactive); <i>Rivera-Jimenez v.

St. Cyr,</i> 533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001), the stop-time rule could not be retroactively applied. The BIA found that at the time he pled guilty, Dr. Peralta lacked sufficient accrued good moral character time to be eligible for suspension of deportation, and so he could not have relied on its availability. As we explain in Part III, we do not reach these issues, which properly arise only in the second step of the retroactivity inquiry required by <i>Landgraf v. USI Film Prods.,</i> 511 U.S. 244, 114 S.Ct. 1483, 128 L.Ed.2d 229 (1994).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> A lay person might reasonably wonder why, if Dr. Peralta has already been found once by the IJ to lack good moral character and to have committed a crime of moral turpitude, he should be given a chance to apply for suspension of deportation, wherein he must show good moral character. Dr. Peralta argues that his moral character would be evaluated at the time the question would be reached at a hearing on his suspension of deportation request, not as of the date in 1997 when he was placed in deportation proceedings, and that he has worked very hard since he committed a crime to restore his good moral character &#8212; indeed, that he relied on his ability to do so and so had a reliance interest. He points out that his medical expertise has been used for the benefit of the public, and to the many letters of support for him. Whatever merit there is to this argument, however, it cannot alter the outcome because Dr. Peralta is statutorily ineligible for suspension of deportation based on his lack of continuous presence.

However, that opinion has since been withdrawn,<i>see Gonzalez-Garcia v. Gonzales,</i> 431 F.3d 234, 2005 WL 3047411 (5th Cir. Nov. 15, 2005), and the unpublished decision that replaced it includes no discussion of the stop-time rule's retroactivity, <i>see Gonzalez-Garcia v. Gonzales,</i> 2006 WL 346298 (5th Cir.

First, he notes that a House report on the bill that eventually became IIRIRA offers a rationale for making subsection (A) retroactive &#8212; to prevent aliens from delaying their proceedings to accrue more continuous presence &#8212; and no rationale that would go to the retroactivity of subsection (B)<i>See</i> H.R.Rep. No. 104-469, pt. 1, at 122 (1996). But this is to be expected, because at the time of the report, the future &#167; 1229d(1) contained <i>only</i> the notice-to-appear stop-time rule; the criminal-offense portion had not yet been added. <i>Id.</i> at 24. Dr. Peralta also quotes a Senate committee memorandum that explained NACARA &#167; 203(a)(1) and made no reference to criminal offenses. <i>See</i> 143 Cong. Rec. S12266 (daily ed. Nov. 9, 1997). But as we have said, Congress enacted NACARA &#167; 203(a)(1) specifically to foreclose the argument that IIRIRA &#167; 309(c)(5)'s use of the term \"notice to appear\" meant subsection (A) had only prospective effect. <i>Afful,</i> 380 F.3d at 7.

No. 105-100, 111 Stat. 2160, 2196 (1997). NACARA &#167; 203(a) amended and clarified a provision of a major immigration statute, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), Pub.L. No. 104-208, Div. C, 110 Stat. 3009, 3009-546 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 5, 8, 18, 28, 42, &amp; 48 U.S.C.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two provisions concern the concept of an alien's \"continuous residence\" and \"continuous physical presence\" in the United States. Continuous presence and/or residence for a specified period of years are basic eligibility requirements for certain types of discretionary immigration relief, including suspension of deportation and cancellation of removal. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229b(a), (b)(1), (d). Accrual of the requisite continuous time, however, can be broken without the alien actually leaving the country. Under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229b(d)(1), an alien's presence and residence are deemed ended in two circumstances: when he or she has been served a notice to appear, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1229b(d)(1)(A), or committed certain criminal offenses, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1229b(d)(1)(B). These provisions are collectively known as the \"stop-time rule.\" The question presented concerns the temporal reach of subsection (B) of the stop-time rule, the provision relating to criminal offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner, Dr. Rub&#233;n Peralta, works as a trauma surgeon at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. More than a decade ago, he committed a crime, marriage fraud, which an Immigration Judge (IJ) determined fell within the universe of offenses listed in subsection (B). The IJ found that subsection (B), which took effect after Dr. Peralta committed the crime and after his deportation proceedings had begun, was retroactively applicable under the transitional rules of IIRIRA. The IJ therefore found Dr. Peralta ineligible for suspension of deportation<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and pretermitted his application for that relief.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On petition for review, Dr. Peralta argues that while IIRIRA's transitional rules may make subsection (A) retroactively applicable, they are silent as to subsection (B). He argues that given the existence of a separate provision that renders prospective the application of IIRIRA except where Congress specifies to the contrary, this silence as to subsection (B) should be read as a clear congressional mandate that subsection (B) be applied only prospectively. Alternatively, he argues, the silence constitutes an ambiguity that we should interpret in his favor to avoid giving the statute impermissible retroactive effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject Dr. Peralta's reading of the statutory language. We find that IIRIRA's transitional rules (as amended by NACARA) clearly render subsection (B) retroactively applicable. This means his marriage fraud offense stopped his accrual of time, and so he was not eligible for the relief he sought. The BIA and IJ were correct. We deny Dr. Peralta's petition for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Peralta, a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic, entered the United States on April 26, 1986 as a visitor. On October 25, 1990, he married Patricia Lemonds, a United States citizen. Based on that marriage, he adjusted his status on January 23, 1991, to that of an alien admitted for conditional permanent residence. On November 4, 1992, Dr. Peralta and Lemonds jointly filed an application to remove the conditions on his residency. Soon after, however, investigators from the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> discovered that the marriage was a sham: It had been arranged by a New Jersey attorney, David Biederman, and a Chicago immigration consultant, Marshall Schoeneman, for the express purpose of procuring immigration benefits for Dr. Peralta. Investigators determined that Lemonds had been promised $1,000 for her cooperation, with $500 due before the marriage and $500 after the divorce. The investigators also determined that Lemonds' signature had been forged on the November 4, 1992 application to remove the conditions on Dr. Peralta's residency. Further, the IJ found, Lemonds was a drug addict and \"was supplied with cocaine in order to secure her participation.\" In 1994, the INS notified Dr. Peralta of its intent to terminate his immigration status; the termination became effective September 19, 1995. Dr. Peralta also faced criminal prosecution: He and eleven other aliens were among twenty-seven people charged in a marriage fraud scheme run by Biederman and Schoeneman. On October 4, 1995, Dr. Peralta pled guilty to violating former 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1325(b) (1994) (now codified at 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1325(c)), which forbids knowingly marrying for the purpose of evading immigration laws. His conviction was entered January 2, 1996. The judgment of conviction stated that his offense concluded on October 20, 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 14, 1997, the INS issued Dr. Peralta an order to show cause<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> charging him with deportability as an alien whose conditional resident status had been terminated, and as an alien who fraudulently entered a marital agreement for the purpose of entering the United States. Those papers were filed with the immigration court on March 27, 1997. Since proceedings against Dr. Peralta commenced prior to April 1, 1997, the transitional rules of IIRIRA apply to his case. <i>See Afful v.

Finally, on July 31, 2003, an IJ found him deportable as charged. On December 8 of that year, the IJ pretermitted the application for suspension of deportation, ruling that Dr. Peralta was ineligible for the relief because of the stop-time effect of subsection (B) of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229b(d)(1). The BIA affirmed on April 14, 2005. Dr. Peralta's sole contention on petition for review is that the agency's interpretation of subsection (B) was error, that he is eligible for consideration for suspension of deportation (now known as cancellation of removal), and that his application for such suspension of deportation should be heard on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Statutory Framework</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) as it existed prior to 1997, aliens ordered removed from the United States could apply to the Attorney General for suspension of deportation. This discretionary relief was available to an alien who could show, inter alia, that he or she had \"been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of not less than seven years immediately preceding the date of such application\" and that \"during all of such period he was and is a person of good moral character.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1254(a) (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1996, however, Congress passed IIRIRA, which eliminated suspension of deportation and replaced it, effective April 1, 1997, with a procedure called cancellation of removal. IIRIRA &#167; 304(a)(3), 110 Stat. at 3009-582 (codified at 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229b(b)(1)) (replacing INA &#167; 244 with a new &#167; 240A); <i>see also Costa v.

Under the terms of IIRIRA, suspension of deportation remained available to aliens who had been placed in deportation proceedings prior to April 1, 1997. <i>See</i> IIRIRA &#167; 309(c)(1), 110 Stat. at 3009-625. However, the suspension remedy was altered, even as to that class of aliens. Under IIRIRA's transitional rules, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229b(d) was given retroactive effect:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">TRANSITIONAL RULE WITH REGARD TO SUSPENSION OF DEPORTATION.&#8212;Paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 240A(d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (relating to continuous residence or physical presence) shall apply to notices to appear issued before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IIRIRA &#167; 309(c)(5), 110 Stat. at 3009-627.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The wording of these provisions quickly led to problems. By their terms, they applied to \"notices to appear.\" However, before enactment of IIRIRA, notices to appear did not exist; aliens at that time instead were served with \"orders to show cause.\" This discrepancy left aliens already in proceedings before April 1, 1997, with room to argue that under the terms of IIRIRA &#167; 309(c)(5), subsection (A) of the stop-time rule did not apply to them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument was foreclosed in 1997, when Congress retroactively amended IIRIRA &#167; 309(c)(5) to address the discrepancy. In relevant part, the amended provision reads as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(5) TRANSITIONAL RULES WITH REGARD TO SUSPENSION OF DEPORTATION.&#8212;(A) IN GENERAL.&#8212;Subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C), paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 240A(d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (relating to continuous residence or physical presence) shall apply to <i>orders to show cause</i> (including those referred to in section 242B(a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as in effect before the title III-A effective date), issued before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">NACARA &#167; 203(a)(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In interpreting NACARA, this circuit, and every other circuit to address the question, concluded \"that the stop-time rule applies retroactively to orders to show cause issued prior to the enactment of the IIRIRA.\" <i>Afful,</i> 380 F.3d at 7 (collecting cases). These holdings came in cases dealing with subsection (A)&#8212;cases, in other words, where the question was whether the issuance of an order to show cause prior to IIRIRA's effective date cut off the accrual of continuous presence or residence. <i>See, e.g., Suassuna v.

Instead, she asserted as a general matter that \"the stop-time rules do, in fact, apply retroactively,\" and then applied subsection (B) to Dr. Peralta's claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Specifically, the IJ found that Dr. Peralta's violation of the marriage fraud statute began on November 19, 1990, when, one month after his \"marriage\" to Lemonds, he filed adjustment-of-status documents with the INS and swore to the veracity of their contents. The IJ concluded he lacked good moral character, at least during the period the fraud was ongoing. The IJ made an additional finding that Dr. Peralta's crime was one of \"moral turpitude\" within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(a)(2):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The so-called spouse ... in this case, a person who was a drug addict at the time, was supplied with cocaine in order to secure her participation....

Since that provision cuts off an alien's accrual of time \"when the alien has committed an offense referred to in\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(a)(2), the IJ found that Dr. Peralta's presence ended on November 19, 1990. Since Dr. Peralta had only been in the United States for four years as of 1990, and since the IJ interpreted IIRIRA as barring any re-start of the continuous presence/residence clock once the stop-time rule had been triggered,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> the IJ held that Dr. Peralta could not show that he had \"been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of not less than seven years,\" as required by the suspension of deportation statute. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1254(a) (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA affirmed, noting that it had previously held (1) that the stop-time rule \"applies to applications for suspension of deportation\" and (2) that the stop-time rule \"operates to terminate the period of continuous physical presence as of the date that an alien commits an offense that renders him inadmissible under\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(a)(2). Combining these two propositions, the BIA held that subsection (B) must have retroactive effect. It applied subsection (B) and found that \"because the respondent last entered [the United States] on April 26, 1986, and the record reflects that he concluded the offense of marriage fraud on October 20, 1992, less than 7 years later, the respondent did not have the requisite continuous physical presence to be eligible for suspension of deportation.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Peralta argues that the BIA's reading of subsection (B) is forbidden by rules of statutory construction, particularly retroactivity rules.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Despite the dangers inherent in retroactive legislation, it is beyond dispute that, within constitutional limits, Congress has the power to enact laws with retrospective effect.\" <i>INS v.

He begins with the language of the two retroactivity provisions, IIRIRA &#167; 309(c)(5) and NACARA &#167; 203(a)(1). Under IIRIRA &#167; 309(c)(5), the stop-time rule \"shall apply\" retroactively with respect to \"notices to appear.\" 110 Stat. at 3009-627. Under NACARA &#167; 203(a)(1), the stop-time rule \"shall apply\" retroactively with respect to \"orders to show cause.\" 111 Stat. at 2196. Neither of these provisions, Dr. Peralta notes, says the stop-time rule \"shall apply\" retroactively to certain criminal offenses. He argues that by their terms, the provisions render retroactive only subsection (A), the portion of the stop-time rule concerned with notices to appear. Further, he says, the lack of any mention of \"offenses\" in the retroactivity provisions constitutes not an ambiguity, but a clear statement by Congress that subsection (B) applies prospectively. This is because Congress mandated in IIRIRA that the changes made by that statute (and those made by NACARA &#167; 203(a), which retroactively amends an IIRIRA provision) have only prospective effect except where it specified to the contrary. IIRIRA &#167; 309(c)(1), 110 Stat. at 3009-625 (\"Subject to the succeeding provisions of this subsection, in the case of an alien who is in exclusion or deportation proceedings as of the ... effective date... the amendments made by this subtitle shall not apply.\"); <i>see also Afful,</i> 380 F.3d at 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatively, Dr. Peralta argues, if we conclude that the retroactivity provisions are ambiguous, then under <i>Landgraf's</i> second step, application of the stop-time provision would have an impermissible retroactive effect. He asserts that absent the stop-time rule he would have had sufficient continuous presence to qualify for suspension of deportation, and while due to his crime he did not have sufficient \"good moral character\" time either when he pled guilty or when his deportation proceedings began, he could have continued accruing such time throughout the pendency of his proceedings. Dr. Peralta argues that \"[h]e would ... have known that he retained the possibility of qualifying for relief.\" This potential future eligibility for relief is the right he says he \"possessed when he acted\" that would be impaired by application of the stop-time rule. <i>Landgraf,</i> 511 U.S. at 280, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117841\"><a href=\"/opinion/117841/landgraf-v-usi-film-products/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We do not reach the second stage of the <i>Landgraf</i> test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The key to our analysis is the fact that the relevant provisions, IIRIRA &#167; 309(c)(5) and NACARA &#167; 203(a)(1), purport to render retroactive, to at least some extent, \"paragraphs (1) <i>and (2)</i>\" of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229b(d) (emphasis added). Paragraph (2), the 90/180 rule, has nothing to do with the issuance of orders to show cause or notices to appear; it deals instead with breaks in continuous presence via actual departure from the country.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This dooms Dr. Peralta's statutory interpretation argument. His position, boiled down to its essence, is that when the two provisions say that &#167; 1229b(d)(1) \"shall apply\" retroactively to \"orders to show cause\" and \"notices to appear,\" they mean that only the section of &#167; 1229b(d)(1) that actually mentions such orders and notices &#8212; subsection (A) &#8212; is rendered retroactive. If that were so for &#167; 1229b(d)(1), however, it would also necessarily be so for &#167; 1229b(d)(2). That would mean the references to paragraph (2) in IIRIRA &#167; 309(c)(5) and NACARA &#167; 203(a)(1) would be read out of the statutory text; paragraph (2) would never be retroactive under any circumstances, since it contains no mention of notices to appear or orders to show cause. \"In construing a statute we are obliged to give effect, if possible, to every word Congress used.\" <i>Rutanen v.

These two paragraphs create three fundamentally different triggering events, each of which cuts off the accrual of an alien's continuous presence and residence. The first trigger is issuance of an order to show cause or notice to appear; the second is commission of a specified crime; the third is actual departure from the country. Because of the \"paragraph (1) and (2)\" language, IIRIRA &#167; 309(c)(5) and NACARA &#167; 203(a)(1) must be read to render retroactive at least one of the triggers in each paragraph. Given that, we see only one feasible conclusion: that the phrases \"notices to appear\" and \"orders to show cause\" function in this context as a shorthand for \"cases.\" In other words, when IIRIRA &#167; 309(c)(5) and NACARA &#167; 203(a)(1) say that the stop-time rule and the 90/180 rule \"shall apply\" to notices to appear and orders to show cause \"issued before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this Act,\" they mean that the two rules are fully applicable, regardless of when an alien's proceedings commenced. No other construction would give any effect to the two provisions' references to paragraph (2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Peralta argues that this interpretation involves impermissibly \"read[ing] unwritten language in to Congressional text.\" But our reading does no such thing.

USI Film Prods.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117841\"><a href=\"/opinion/117841/landgraf-v-usi-film-products/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">244</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117841\"><a href=\"/opinion/117841/landgraf-v-usi-film-products/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Dr. Peralta argues that his moral character would be evaluated at the time the question would be reached at a hearing on his suspension of deportation request, not as of the date in 1997 when he was placed in deportation proceedings, and that he has worked very hard since he committed a crime to restore his good moral character &#8212; indeed, that he relied on his ability to do so and so had a reliance interest. He points out that his medical expertise has been used for the benefit of the public, and to the many letters of support for him. Whatever merit there is to this argument, however, it cannot alter the outcome because Dr. Peralta is statutorily ineligible for suspension of deportation based on his lack of continuous presence. We rest on this logically prior ground</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Dr. Peralta argued in his reply brief that a Fifth Circuit case adopted his reading of the statutory language. However, that opinion has since been withdrawn,<i>see Gonzalez-Garcia v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"39984\"><a href=\"/opinion/39984/gonzalez-garcia-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">234</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3047411</span></span> (5th Cir. Nov. 15, 2005), and the unpublished decision that replaced it includes no discussion of the stop-time rule's retroactivity, <i>see Gonzalez-Garcia v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">346298</span></span> (5th Cir. Feb. 14, 2006).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> In addition to his textual arguments, Dr. Peralta posits that the legislative history supports his position. First, he notes that a House report on the bill that eventually became IIRIRA offers a rationale for making subsection (A) retroactive &#8212; to prevent aliens from delaying their proceedings to accrue more continuous presence &#8212; and no rationale that would go to the retroactivity of subsection (B)<i>See</i> H.R.Rep. No. 104-469, pt. 1, at 122 (1996). But this is to be expected, because at the time of the report, the future &#167; 1229d(1) contained <i>only</i> the notice-to-appear stop-time rule; the criminal-offense portion had not yet been added. <i>Id.</i> at 24. Dr. Peralta also quotes a Senate committee memorandum that explained NACARA &#167; 203(a)(1) and made no reference to criminal offenses. <i>See</i> 143 Cong. Rec. S12266 (daily ed. Nov. 9, 1997). But as we have said, Congress enacted NACARA &#167; 203(a)(1) specifically to foreclose the argument that IIRIRA &#167; 309(c)(5)'s use of the term \"notice to appear\" meant subsection (A) had only prospective effect. <i>Afful,</i> 380 F.3d at 7. It is hardly surprising that the memorandum would not mention subsection (B) in explaining such an amendment.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
