Bramson, Massachusetts Administrator of Human\nResources.\n\n\n\n                         January 30, 2007\n\f            BOUDIN, Chief Judge. Linda Jeneski, who appeals from the\n\ndismissal of her civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983, 1985\n\n(2000), was hired in 1988 by the City of Worcester, Massachusetts,\n\nto serve in a division of the city manager's office.    Worcester had\n\nan executive order in place, dating from 1972, which provided that\n\nemployees of the city manager's office were not subject to the\n\ncivil service laws, see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 31 (2006), leaving them\n\nas employees at will.    In September 2002, Jeneski was laid off by\n\nthe city.\n\n            In 2005, Jeneski brought the present action in federal\n\ndistrict court against the city, certain of its officials and the\n\nstate's Administrator of Human Resources, who is responsible for\n\nthe state's civil service laws.        In addition to federal civil\n\nrights claims--alleging deprivation of equal protection and due\n\nprocess--Jeneski asserted claims under state law based on wrongful\n\ndischarge and other theories. She also sought class action status.\n\n            The district court dismissed the federal causes of action\n\nfor failure to state a claim, Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), and\n\ndeclined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Jeneski's state\n\nlaw claims.      28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3) (2000).        We review the\n\ndismissal of the federal claims de novo, accepting all well-pleaded\n\nfacts and giving the non-movant all reasonable inferences, not\n\nincluding \"rhetorical flourishes, including unsupported conclusions\n\n\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fand assertions.\"             Palmer v. Champion Mortgage, 465 F.3d 24, 25, 27\n\n(1st Cir. 2006).\n\n                  The operative 17-page second amended complaint contains\n\na recitation of facts and grievances of which some are central to\n\nthis appeal and others are not.                Foremost is Jeneski's claim that\n\nfrom       1972    onward,     Worcester    attached       the   label    of     the   city\n\nmanager's office to a variety of city agencies and wrongfully\n\nexempted          them   under    the   1972   city    order     from    civil    service\n\nprotection.          Jeneski says that the exemption was unlawful under\n\nMassachusetts state law and violated her constitutional rights.\n\n                  The constitutional right principally urged by Jeneski is\n\nequal protection.                The gist of this claim is that Worcester\n\nexcluded a large group of employees, including Jeneski, from civil\n\nservice protection otherwise required under state law.                         This, says\n\nJeneski, was not only unlawful under state law but violated the\n\nConstitution by denying such employees equal treatment with others\n\nwho remained protected.\n\n                  If this were done in order to harm a specially protected\n\nclass       (e.g.,       a   racial     minority)     or   to    burden    fundamental\n\nconstitutional rights (e.g., free speech), governmental authorities\n\nwould have to provide a substantial or compelling justification\n\n(which one depends on the circumstances),1 but there is no claim a\n\n\n       1\n      Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 197 (1976) (gender\nclassification); Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.S. 214, 216\n(1944) (racial classification); Mass. Bd. of Retirement v. Murgia,\n\n                                            -3-\n\fspecially \"suspect classification\" is in use or that the aim of the\n\n1972 executive order was to curtail free speech or some other\n\nconstitutionally protected right.\n\n          In her complaint, Jeneski implies that her own discharge\n\nwas connected to her criticism of city administration. But the\n\nclassification of which she complains was adopted long before she\n\nwas hired, and she has not made a first amendment claim.             Absent a\n\nsuspect   classification     or    undue     burden     on     fundamental\n\nconstitutional rights, a classification made by government actors\n\nis vulnerable under the Equal Protection Clause only if no rational\n\njustification can be imagined for its use.            Hoffman v. City of\n\nWarwick, 909 F.2d 608, 621-22 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n          The only classification by the city or its officers is\n\nthat the city by executive order exempted from civil service\n\nprotection those who work for certain offices--broadly speaking,\n\nthose nominally under the control of the city manager.             If the city\n\nchooses to have more than ordinary trust in its city manager and\n\nwants to give him or her a free hand in personnel management, such\n\na policy choice cannot be described as irrational.\n\n          Jeneski   says   that   the   district   court     was    resolving\n\ninferences against her by speculating as to legitimate reasons for\n\n\n\n427 U.S. 307, 313 n.3 (1976) (providing examples of recognized\nfundamental rights); Williams v. Rhodes, 393 U.S. 23, 30-31 (1968)\n(burden on first amendment rights). See generally Nowak & Rotunda,\nConstitutional Law ch. 14 (5th ed. 1995).\n\n                                  -4-\n\fthe action exempting city of Worcester employees.               This is a\n\nmisunderstanding of the minimum rationality test.           The question is\n\nnot what went on in the mind of the state actor but whether anyone,\n\nincluding the judge, can conceive of a rational reason for such a\n\nclassification.   Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U.S. 1, 11-12 (1992).           In\n\nthis case, special trust and greater flexibility are such a reason.\n\n          Jeneski    says   that   this   exemption   was    illegal   under\n\nMassachusetts law.     Although a city may exempt city managers and\n\ntheir staffs from ordinary civil service protections, Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws ch. 31, § 48, Jeneski says that Worcester did not meet the\n\nrequired statutory conditions and that in Worcester the city\n\nmanager label was falsely assigned to some of the entities.\n\n          Possibly Worcester did act in violation of state law2–-we\n\ndo not decide the point–-but a violation of state law is not by\n\nitself a constitutional violation.          Hoffman, 909 F.2d at 623.\n\nJeneski says that in Hoffman, the violation was a misdemeanor and\n\nhere it is a felony.    The fact remains that a classification that\n\nis minimally rational under equal protection principles does not\n\nbecome irrational because the step taken violates local law.\n\nSnowden v. Hughes, 321 U.S. 1, 11 (1944).\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      Jeneski points to the passage of state legislation in August\n2006 that specifically exempts employees in the city of Worcester's\nmunicipal offices, 2006 Mass. Legis. Serv. ch. 196, and to\nindications in background documents that it was sought by Worcester\nprecisely to erase legal doubts.\n\n                                   -5-\n\f          As the Fifth Circuit explained in Stern v. Tarrant County\n\nHosp. Dist., 778 F.2d 1052, 1054 (5th Cir. 1985) (en banc), cert.\n\ndenied, 476 U.S. 1108 (1986):\n\n          We reaffirm today the settled constitutional\n          rule that state agencies may pursue legitimate\n          purposes by any means having a conceivable\n          rational relationship to those purposes.     A\n          decision that passes constitutional muster\n          under the rational-basis test does not violate\n          the equal protection clause simply because it\n          violates a state . . . statute.\n\n          Jeneski relies heavily upon Baker v. Coxe, 230 F.3d 470\n\n(1st Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 532 U.S. 995 (2001), but its facts–-\n\ndelay in processing permits and alleged retaliation by government\n\nofficials--have almost nothing to do with this case.      Baker also\n\neffectively rejects Jeneski's efforts to recast a failed equal\n\nprotection claim as one based on substantive due process.      Apart\n\nfrom incorporation of more specific Bill of Rights provisions into\n\nthe 14th Amendment, substantive due process has a very limited\n\nreach under modern precedent.3\n\n          Jeneski's brief also refers briefly to procedural due\n\nprocess but to what end is unclear.    A procedural due process claim\n\nrequires the plaintiff to allege that she has a property interest\n\ndefined by state law and that she has been deprived of that\n\nproperty interest without adequate process.     PFZ Properties, Inc.\n\n\n     3\n      Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165, 172 (1952)(\"shocks the\nconscience\" test); see also Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37, 44\n(1st Cir. 1992); Garcia by Garcia v. Miera, 817 F.2d 650, 658 (10th\nCir. 1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 959 (1988).\n\n                                 -6-\n\fv. Rodriguez, 928 F.2d 28, 30 (1st Cir. 1991), cert. dismissed as\n\nimprovidently granted, 503 U.S. 257 (1992).       In her complaint,\n\nJeneski has alleged neither.\n\n          In addition to section 1983, Jeneski invokes section\n\n1985, 42 U.S.C. § 1985, which is directed so far as pertinent here\n\nto conspiracies to deprive another of equal protection.    But as no\n\ncolorable violation of equal protection has been alleged, the\n\nconspiracy claim has no purchase.    Whether state law claims remain\n\navailable to Jeneski is a matter that is not before us since the\n\ndistrict court had discretion not to resolve them.        Brennan v.\n\nHendrigan, 888 F.2d 189, 196 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n          Finally, Jeneski's brief says that there was \"fraudulent\n\nconcealment\" by the city--a phrase ordinarily relevant to statute\n\nof limitations questions--and that the district court failed to\n\nrecognize that fact.   In the district court, Jeneski apparently\n\nalleged fraudulent concealment in at least two different contexts:\n\nin response to a statute of limitations defense and in explaining\n\nwhy she had not exhausted possible state remedies so far as this\n\nmight be a required predicate to a procedural due process claim.\n\n          The grounds on which we affirm the district court's\n\ndismissal do not depend on a statute of limitations defense.    And,\n\nas we do not think that the second amended complaint fairly asserts\n\nthe elements of a procedural due process claim, the question\n\n\n\n\n                               -7-\n\fwhether state remedies have been exhausted is also not one that\n\nneeds to be addressed to sustain the district court's judgment.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -8-\n\f",

Worcester had an executive order in place, dating from 1972, which provided that employees of the city manager's office were not subject to the civil service laws, <i>see</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 31 (2006), leaving them as employees at will. In September 2002, Jeneski was laid off by the city.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 2005, Jeneski brought the present action in federal district court against the city, certain of its officials and the state's Administrator of Human Resources, who is responsible for the state's civil service laws. In addition to federal civil rights claims&#8212;alleging deprivation of equal protection and due process&#8212;Jeneski asserted claims under state law based on wrongful discharge and other theories. She also sought class action status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court dismissed the federal causes of action for failure to state a claim, Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Jeneski's state law claims. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367(c)(3) (2000). We review the dismissal of the federal claims <i>de novo,</i> accepting all well-pleaded facts and giving the non-movant all reasonable inferences, not including \"rhetorical flourishes, including unsupported conclusions and assertions.\" <i>Palmer v. Champion Mortgage,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202442\"><a href=\"/opinion/202442/palmer-v-champion-mortgage/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 25, 27 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The operative 17-page second amended complaint contains a recitation of facts and grievances of which some are central to this appeal and others are not. Foremost is Jeneski's claim that from 1972 onward, Worcester attached the label of the city manager's office to a variety of city agencies and wrongfully exempted them under the 1972 city order from civil service protection. Jeneski says that the exemption was unlawful under Massachusetts state law and violated her constitutional rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The constitutional right principally urged by Jeneski is equal protection. The gist of this claim is that Worcester excluded a large group of employees, including Jeneski, from civil service protection otherwise required under state law. This, says Jeneski, was not only unlawful under state law but violated the Constitution by denying such employees equal treatment with others who remained protected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If this were done in order to harm a specially protected class (<i>e.g.,</i> a racial minority) or to burden fundamental constitutional rights (<i>e.g.,</i> free speech), governmental authorities would have to provide a substantial or compelling justification (which one depends on the circumstances),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> but there is no claim a specially \"suspect classification\" is in use or that the aim of the 1972 executive order was to curtail free speech or some other constitutionally protected right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In her complaint, Jeneski implies that her own discharge was connected to her criticism of city administration. But the classification of which she complains was adopted long before she was hired, and she has not made a first amendment claim. Absent a suspect classification or undue burden on fundamental constitutional rights, a classification made by government actors is vulnerable under the Equal Protection Clause only if no rational justification can be imagined for its use. <i>Hoffman v. City of Warwick,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"545483\"><a href=\"/opinion/545483/frank-hoffman-etc-v-city-of-warwick-renauld-langlois-etc-v-city-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">909</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">608</span></a></span>, 621-22 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only classification by the city or its officers is that the city by executive order exempted from civil service protection those who work for certain offices-broadly speaking, those nominally under the control of the city manager. If the city chooses to have more than ordinary trust in its city manager and wants to give him or her a free hand in personnel management, such a policy choice cannot be described as irrational.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jeneski says that the district court was resolving inferences against her by speculating as to legitimate reasons for the action exempting city of Worcester employees. This is a misunderstanding of the minimum rationality test. The question is not what went on in the mind of the state actor but whether anyone, including the judge, can conceive of a rational reason for such a classification. <i>Nordlinger v. Hahn,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112763\"><a href=\"/opinion/112763/nordlinger-v-hahn/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 11-12, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112763\"><a href=\"/opinion/112763/nordlinger-v-hahn/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1992). In this case, special trust and greater flexibility are such a reason.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jeneski says that this exemption was illegal under Massachusetts law. Although a city may exempt city managers and their staffs from ordinary civil service protections, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 31, &#167; 48, Jeneski says that Worcester did not meet the required statutory conditions and that in Worcester the city manager label was falsely assigned to some of the entities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Possibly Worcester did act in violation of state law<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>&#8212;we do not decide the point&#8212; but a violation of state law is not by itself a constitutional violation. <i>Hoffman,</i> 909 F.2d at 623. Jeneski says that in <i>Hoffman,</i> the violation was a misdemeanor and here it is a felony. The fact remains that a classification that is minimally rational under equal protection principles does not become irrational because the step taken violates local law. <i>Snowden v. Hughes,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103921\"><a href=\"/opinion/103921/snowden-v-hughes/\"><span class=\"volume\">321</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 11, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">64</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">638</span></span> (2001), but its facts&#8212;delay in processing permits and alleged retaliation by government officials&#8212;have almost nothing to do with this case. <i>Baker</i> also effectively rejects Jeneski's efforts to recast a failed equal protection claim as one based on substantive due process. Apart from incorporation of more specific Bill of Rights provisions into the 14th Amendment, substantive due process has a very limited reach under modern precedent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jeneski's brief also refers briefly to procedural due process but to what end is unclear.

But as no colorable violation of equal protection has been alleged, the conspiracy claim has no purchase.
