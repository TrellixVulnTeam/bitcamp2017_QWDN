We have therefore substituted\nAttorney General Gonzales for John Ashcroft as the respondent. See\nFed. R. App. P. 43(c)(2).\n\f          Per Curiam.   Petitioner Adewale Olaoye, a native and\n\ncitizen of Nigeria, petitions for review of a decision of the Board\n\nof Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirming the denial by an Immigration\n\nJudge (IJ) of his application for asylum or withholding of removal.\n\nWe deny the petition.\n\n          On December 28, 2001, traveling under a false Belizean\n\npassport, Olaoye arrived in the United States at the Miami airport,\n\nostensibly as a \"transit without visa\" en route from El Salvador to\n\nthe Bahamas, but with the real purpose of entering the United\n\nStates.   At the airport, he was detained by the Immigration and\n\nNaturalization Service,1 which detained him pending investigation.\n\nOn January 3, 2002, the Service commenced removal proceedings.\n\nHowever, the Service also determined that Olaoye had a credible\n\nfear of persecution in Nigeria, and paroled him into the United\n\nStates to apply for asylum.     On May 14, 2002, Olaoye conceded\n\nremovability and applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and\n\nprotection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT).2\n\n          On October 16, 2002, the IJ held a hearing at which\n\nOlaoye testified as the sole witness. According to Olaoye, he fled\n\n\n     1\n      On March 1, 2003, well after the events and proceedings of\nthis case, the relevant functions of the Service were transferred\nto the new Department of Homeland Security and reorganized into the\nBureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n     2\n      The Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or\nDegrading Treatment or Punishment, Dec. 10, 1984, 1465 U.N.T.S. 85;\nsee also 8 U.S.C. ยง 1231 (implementing CAT); 8 C.F.R. ยง 208.16(c)\n(same).\n\n                               -2-\n\fNigeria, leaving his wife behind, after being attacked multiple\n\ntimes by members of the secretive and powerful Ogboni cult, of\n\nwhich his father had been a member.       The cult had sent him a death\n\nthreat letter that, despite its secretive nature, included a\n\nsignature, official stamp, return address, and \"carbon copy\" list.\n\nAfter he was assaulted thrice (and his wife twice) by Ogboni cult\n\nmembers, Olaoye fled (without his wife) by stowing away aboard a\n\nRussian trans-Atlantic vessel.      Once the vessel was at sea, Olaoye\n\nrevealed himself to the captain -- an American -- and told him his\n\nstory.   The captain expressed sympathy and offered to let him off\n\non El Salvador's Gulf of Mexico coast.      He climbed off the ship in\n\nknee-deep water \"off the coast\" of the city of San Salvador.      After\n\nabout half an hour, he found a sympathetic stranger who fed him,\n\nsheltered him, and obtained for him, without compensation, a false\n\npassport and plane ticket to the Bahamas.      The person who did these\n\nfavors is known to him only as \"Juan.\"\n\n            The IJ found Olaoye's testimony, \"although consistent and\n\ndetailed,    to   be   incredible   and   implausible.\"     She   found\n\nparticularly unbelievable many of the details (which we have not\n\nrecited here) of events in Nigeria; the death threat letter with\n\nreturn address;3 and the entirety of his story of how he left\n\n\n     3\n      The letter, as well as an official-looking document attesting\nto his father's membership, bears the stamp \"Ogboni Fraternity,\" a\npossible reference to the Reformed Ogboni Fraternity, a non-secret\nand perfectly legal civic organization that is distinct from the\nsecretive (and banned) Ogboni cult.\n\n                                    -3-\n\fNigeria. On her own initiative, the IJ located and introduced into\n\nthe record a map of Central America, which shows that El Salvador\n\nis on the Pacific Ocean, not the Gulf of Mexico, and at any rate\n\nSan Salvador is at least twenty miles inland.              Overall, the IJ\n\nfound Olaoye's testimony and supporting documents to be \"doctored,\n\nuntrue, nonsensical, implausible and internally inconsistent.\"\n\nConsequently,     she    denied    his     applications   for    asylum   and\n\nwithholding of removal, and furthermore found that he had knowingly\n\nfiled a frivolous application, which can result in a permanent ban\n\nfrom entry into the United States.          See 8 U.S.C. ยง 1158(d)(6).\n\n            On appeal, the BIA vacated the IJ's finding that Olaoye\n\nhad knowingly filed a frivolous application, but affirmed the\n\nfindings that Olaoye was not entitled to asylum or withholding of\n\nremoval.    It further found that he was not entitled to protection\n\nunder the CAT.4    Olaoye timely appealed the denial of asylum and\n\nwithholding of removal.\n\n            Since the BIA's order adopted the IJ's decision and\n\nfindings with regard to the issues presented on appeal, we review\n\nthe IJ's decision as the adopted final agency determination.\n\nAlbathani    v.   INS,    318     F.3d     365,   373   (1st    Cir.   2003).\n\n\n\n     4\n      The IJ appears not to have adjudicated Olaoye's claim for\nprotection under the CAT. However, Olaoye does not argue that the\nBIA erred in denying him such relief, and has thus waived any\nchallenge to the BIA's resolution of that claim. Chen v. Gonzales,\nNo. 04-2623, 2005 U.S. App. LEXIS 16908, at *3 n.3 (1st Cir. Aug.\n12, 2005).\n\n                                     -4-\n\f\"Determinations      of    eligibility       for   asylum    or    withholding\n\ndeportation    are       conclusive    'if     supported    by     reasonable,\n\nsubstantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a\n\nwhole.'\"   Id. at 372 (quoting INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478,\n\n481 (1992)). \"[T]he administrative findings of fact are conclusive\n\nunless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to\n\nthe   contrary.\"     8    U.S.C.   ยง   1252(b)(4)(B).       This   deferential\n\nstandard means that \"[t]o reverse the BIA finding we must find that\n\nthe evidence not only supports that conclusion, but compels it.\"\n\nElias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. at 481 n.1.\n\n           In this case, the IJ's adverse credibility determination\n\nis amply supported in the record and by the specific reasons stated\n\nin her oral decision.         As the IJ explained, certain aspects of\n\nOlaoye's story -- particularly the supposed death threat letter and\n\nthe story of how he reached the United States -- are implausible.\n\nThe IJ was entitled to conclude that, because Olaoye was not\n\ncredible in numerous parts of his story, he was not credible in any\n\nof it.     Olaoye gives us no reason to doubt the IJ's adverse\n\ncredibility finding, and we certainly cannot say that the evidence\n\ncompels the conclusion that the IJ erred.\n\n           The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\f",
