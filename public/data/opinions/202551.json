We affirm the district court's\n\ndecision   that   the        Rooker-Feldman          doctrine    deprives       the    lower\n\nfederal courts of subject matter jurisdiction over this case.\n\n                            I.    The Saga of the Terrace\n\n           The    district             court's      opinion   below     lays     out     the\n\nexcruciating details of the ten-year battle over a terrace now\n\nowned by Plaintiffs.1            Davison v. Puerto Rico Firefighters Corps,\n\n415 F. Supp. 2d 33, 35-38 (D.P.R. 2006).                      We will not repeat the\n\nentire story.     Suffice it to say that the parties have long been\n\nembroiled in a nasty dispute over the existence, location, and\n\ncharacteristics        of    a    common     fire     corridor   across     Plaintiff's\n\nallegedly private terrace.\n\n           The relevant chapters of the epic story for our purposes\n\nconcern the Plaintiff's trips to state court.                         On May 3, 2001,\n\nPlaintiffs appealed the Puerto Rico Firefighters Corps' (\"PRFC\")\n\nreinstatement     of    a    May       10,   2000    order    requiring    a    five-foot\n\ncorridor around the perimeter of the terrace, to be blocked off by\n\n\n1\n   Plaintiffs initially played the role of lessee in the dispute,\nbut eventually chose to purchase the condominium unit despite the\ncontroversy.\n\n                                             -3-\n\fa nine-foot Plycem wall.           On September 21, 2001, the Puerto Rico\n\nCourt of Appeals ruled that Plaintiffs' appeal was untimely and\n\nupheld    the    order.    The     same    court    affirmed      its   decision     on\n\nOctober    25,    2001,   after     the    Plaintiffs       asked   the     court    to\n\nreconsider.\n\n            A year later, Plaintiffs having taken no steps to comply\n\nwith the PRFC order, the Solicitor General of Puerto Rico asked a\n\nlocal trial court to force Plaintiffs to comply.                        In response,\n\nPlaintiffs challenged the Court of Appeals' affirmation of the\n\norder.    The trial court refused to hear Plaintiffs' challenge on\n\nthe grounds that it was foreclosed by res judicata.                       Plaintiffs\n\nappealed this decision all the way to the Puerto Rico Supreme\n\nCourt, which on December 10, 2004 denied their petition and on\n\nJanuary    28,    2005    denied    their       request     for   reconsideration.\n\nPlaintiffs were eventually held in contempt of court for not\n\ncomplying with the order, although as of the time of this appeal,\n\nthe   required     work   was     well    underway,        as   evidenced    by     the\n\nphotographic exhibits accompanying Plaintiffs' counsel at oral\n\nargument.\n\n                                 II.     Discussion\n\n            Plaintiffs     appeal      the      district    court's     decision     to\n\ndismiss their equal protection and due process claims on the basis\n\nof the Rooker-Feldman doctrine.            They also claim that the district\n\ncourt erred in dismissing the case without addressing whether the\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fdefendants politically discriminated against Plaintiffs. We review\n\na dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction de novo,\n\n\"accepting the plaintiffs' well-pleaded facts as true and indulging\n\nall reasonable inferences to their behoof.\"   McCloskey v. Mueller,\n\n446 F.3d 262, 266 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n          A.   Rooker-Feldman Doctrine\n\n          What has become known as the Rooker-Feldman doctrine\n\narose from the Supreme Court's decisions in two cases, Rooker v.\n\nFidelity Trust Co., 263 U.S. 413 (1923), and District of Columbia\n\nCourt of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U.S. 462 (1983).   In both of these\n\ncases, state-court losers instituted federal suits complaining of\n\ninjuries caused by the state-court judgments rendered against them\n\nand asking the federal courts to review and reject those judgments.\n\nThe Supreme Court held that district courts did not have the\n\nauthority to review final judgments of state courts; only the\n\nSupreme Court has that power.   Feldman, 460 U.S. at 482.\n\n          In Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Industries Corp., the\n\nSupreme Court reined in the lower courts' application of Rooker-\n\nFeldman, limiting the doctrine to the those kinds of cases from\n\nwhich the doctrine derived. 544 U.S. 280, 284 (2005). Post-Exxon,\n\nthe lower courts cannot rely on Rooker-Feldman to dismiss a case\n\nunless, inter alia, the federal plaintiff seeks redress of an\n\ninjury caused by an allegedly erroneous state court decision; if\n\nthe plaintiff alleges a constitutional violation by an adverse\n\n\n                                -5-\n\fparty independent of the injury caused by the state court judgment,\n\nthe doctrine does not bar jurisdiction.         Id.; Todd v. Weltman,\n\nWeinberg & Reis Co., 434 F.3d 432, 437 (6th Cir. 2006) (reiterating\n\nthat Rooker-Feldman does not apply when the Plaintiff complains of\n\na wrong independent of injuries caused by a related state court\n\njudgment); Washington v. Wilmore, 407 F.3d 274, 280 (4th Cir. 2005)\n\n(holding that Rooker-Feldman does not apply when the plaintiff's\n\n\"injury rests not on the state court judgment itself but rather on\n\nthe   alleged   violation   of   his   constitutional   rights   by   [the\n\ndefendant]\").\n\n           Plaintiffs first assert that Rooker-Feldman should not\n\napply because they have never had their day in court and thus have\n\nnever been allowed to present any evidence or argue the merits of\n\ntheir case.     Plaintiffs may not have actually argued the merits of\n\ntheir claims in state court, but to rule that Plaintiffs must be\n\nallowed a \"day in court\" would be to say that the Puerto Rico Court\n\nof Appeals was wrong in holding that Plaintiffs' initial appeal of\n\nthe PRFC order was untimely and that the highest court in Puerto\n\nRico was wrong in denying Plaintiffs' challenge to the same order\n\non the grounds of res judicata.        Rooker-Feldman squarely applies\n\nwhen a plaintiff insists that we must review and reject a final\n\nstate court judgment.\n\n           Plaintiffs next directly challenge the conduct of the\n\nPRFC and the courts of Puerto Rico, which, they claim, the federal\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fcourts may examine under the rubric of substantive due process.\n\nTheir theory appears to be that Rooker-Feldman does not apply\n\nbecause their \"truly horrendous\" situation \"peaked\" well after\n\nPlaintiffs' initial appeal of the PRFC order --                  during the\n\nenforcement battles over the order -- and therefore that their\n\ncomplaint is with the defendants' and the state courts' behavior\n\nafter the 2001 Court of Appeals' judgment.          Plaintiffs focus their\n\nchallenge on the PRFC's vacillating orders beginning in 2001 and\n\nthe state courts' refusal to hear Plaintiffs' challenge to the\n\nfinal   order   in   2004    and   2005.     Plaintiffs'   reasoning   fails,\n\nhowever, because the only real injury to Plaintiffs is ultimately\n\nstill caused by a state court judgment.              Plaintiffs sought to\n\nchallenge the PRFC's conduct and resultant order, but the highest\n\nstate court in Puerto Rico refused to hear the challenge on the\n\ngrounds of res judicata.           The order was thus upheld, and this is\n\nthe   injury    of   which   the    Plaintiffs   complain.     To   find   for\n\nPlaintiffs now would require us to declare that the state court\n\nwrongly decided Plaintiffs' claim.            The Rooker-Feldman doctrine\n\nprevents us from doing this.            As the district court noted, the\n\nproper forum for challenging an unlawful state court ruling is the\n\nUnited States Supreme Court, on appeal of the highest state court's\n\nfinal judgment.      Davison, 415 F. Supp. 2d at 40 n.3.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\f          B.   Political Discrimination Claim\n\n          Plaintiffs' other argument on appeal is that the district\n\ncourt erred in dismissing the case in its entirety before ruling on\n\ntheir political discrimination claim.   This argument fails at the\n\nonset because Plaintiffs' Complaint did not include any First\n\nAmendment claims on which to premise the error.   Rather, the first\n\nmention of a potential political discrimination issue occurred in\n\na footnote of the district court's opinion, when it \"surmise[d]\n\nthat Plaintiffs' equal protection claim [was] meant as a charge of\n\npolitical discrimination.\"   Id. at 38 n.2.   The district court did\n\nnot decide the issue because it was never raised.\n\n                         III.   Conclusion\n\n          For the reasons stated above, we affirm the district\n\ncourt's dismissal of Plaintiffs' equal protection and due process\n\nclaims.   Plaintiffs never asserted a First Amendment political\n\ndiscrimination challenge, and therefore the district court did not\n\nerr in failing to rule on the issue.    We hope our ruling finally\n\nbrings to an end the ten-year saga of the unwitting terrace.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -8-\n\f",

Rather, the first mention of a potential political discrimination issue occurred in a footnote of the district court's opinion, when it \"surmise[d] that Plaintiffs' equal protection claim [was] meant as a charge of political discrimination.\" <i>Id.</i> at 38 n. 2.

On May 3, 2001, Plaintiffs appealed the Puerto Rico Firefighters Corps' (\"PRFC\") reinstatement of a May 10, 2000 order requiring a five-foot corridor around the perimeter of the terrace, to be blocked off by a nine-foot Plycem wall. On September 21, 2001, the Puerto Rico Court of Appeals ruled that Plaintiffs' appeal was untimely and upheld the order. The same court affirmed its decision on October 25, 2001, after the Plaintiffs asked the court to reconsider.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A year later, Plaintiffs having taken no steps to comply with the PRFC order, the Solicitor General of Puerto Rico asked a local trial court to force Plaintiffs to comply. In response, Plaintiffs challenged the Court of Appeals' affirmation of the order. The trial court refused to hear Plaintiffs' challenge on the grounds that it was foreclosed by res judicata. Plaintiffs appealed this decision all the way to the Puerto Rico Supreme Court, which on December 10, 2004 denied their petition and on January 28, 2005 denied their request for reconsideration. Plaintiffs were eventually held in contempt of court for not complying with the order, although as of the time of this appeal, the required work was well underway, as evidenced by the photographic exhibits accompanying Plaintiffs' counsel at oral argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Discussion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs appeal the district court's decision to dismiss their equal protection and due process claims on the basis of the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine.

In both of these cases, state-court losers instituted federal suits complaining of injuries caused by the state-court judgments rendered against them and asking the federal courts to review and reject those judgments. The Supreme Court held that district courts did not have the authority to review final judgments of state courts; only the Supreme Court has that power. <i>Feldman,</i> 460 U.S. at 482, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110889\"><a href=\"/opinion/110889/district-of-columbia-court-of-appeals-v-feldman/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Post-<i>Exxon,</i> the lower courts cannot rely on <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> to dismiss a case unless, <i>inter alia,</i> the federal plaintiff seeks redress of an injury <i>caused by</i> an allegedly erroneous state court decision; if the plaintiff alleges a constitutional violation by an adverse party independent of the injury caused by the state court judgment, the doctrine does not bar jurisdiction. <i>Id.; Todd v.

Plaintiffs may not have actually argued the merits of their claims in state court, but to rule that Plaintiffs must be allowed a \"day in court\" would be to say that the Puerto Rico Court of Appeals was wrong in holding that Plaintiffs' initial appeal of the PRFC order was untimely and that the highest court in Puerto Rico was wrong in denying Plaintiffs' challenge to the same order on the grounds of res judicata. <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> squarely applies when a plaintiff insists that we must review and reject a final state court judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs next directly challenge the conduct of the PRFC and the courts of Puerto Rico, which, they claim, the federal courts may examine under the rubric of substantive due process. Their theory appears to be that <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> does not apply because their \"truly horrendous\" situation \"peaked\" well after Plaintiffs' initial appeal of the PRFC order &#8212; during the enforcement battles over the order &#8212; and therefore that their complaint is with the defendants' and the state courts' behavior after the 2001 Court of Appeals' judgment. Plaintiffs focus their challenge on the PRFC's vacillating orders beginning in 2001 and the state courts' refusal to hear Plaintiffs' challenge to the final order in 2004 and 2005. Plaintiffs' reasoning fails, however, because the only real injury to Plaintiffs is ultimately still caused by a state court judgment. Plaintiffs sought to challenge the PRFC's conduct and resultant order, but the highest state court in Puerto Rico refused to hear the challenge on the grounds of res judicata. The order was thus upheld, and this is the injury of which the Plaintiffs complain. To find for Plaintiffs now would require us to declare that the state court wrongly decided Plaintiffs' claim. The <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine prevents us from doing this. As the district court noted, the proper forum for challenging an unlawful state court ruling is the United States Supreme Court, on appeal of the highest state court's final judgment. <i>Davison,</i> 415 F.Supp.2d at 40 n. 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.
