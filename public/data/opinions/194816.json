The  government  agreed  to\n\nrecommend  a  six-year  downward  departure  from  the  mandatory\n\nfifteen-year  minimum.    Its  promise  was  conditioned  on  (1)\n\nSaubar's  \"specific agreement\" to render \"substantial assistance\"\n\nto the  government in other criminal  investigations and prosecu-\n\ntions,  and  (2)  Saubar's  agreement  not  to  \"argue\" that  the\n\ndistrict  court impose  less than  the nine-year  sentence recom-\n\nmended by the government.   At sentencing, the government  recom-\n\nmended  the  six-year  downward  departure as  promised  and  the\n\ndistrict court approved the recommendation.  \n\n          Although   Saubar  concedes  that   we  lack  appellate\n\njurisdiction of  a sentencing appeal  brought by a  defendant who\n\nseeks to challenge the extent of a downward departure, see, e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nUnited  States v.

Once the government \"opened the\n      \n\ndoor\" by  making its section  3553(e) motion, the  argument goes,\n\nthe  sentencing  court  was  empowered to  enlarge  the  downward\n\ndeparture   to   reflect    Saubar's   \"extraordinary    physical\n\nimpairment.\"2  See U.S.S.G.   5H1.4.3\n                  \n\n          It is well  settled in this  circuit that a  sentencing\n\ncourt  may not depart  below a mandatory  minimum sentence unless\n\nthe government  makes a \"substantial assistance\"  motion pursuant\n\nto 18 U.S.C.   3553(e) or U.S.S.G.   5K1.1.  See United States v.\n                                                              \n\nMazzaferro,  907 F.2d 251, 254  (1st Cir. 1990);  see also United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Mariano,  983 F.2d 1150, 1155 (1st  Cir. 1993).  Saubar\n                 \n\nis  bound by  the  terms under  which  the government  agreed  to\n\nexercise  its  discretionary  power  to  make  its  indispensable\n\nrecommendation.   Acknowledging  his voluntary  agreement not  to\n\n\"argue  for  a  lower sentence,\"  Saubar  says  that he  benignly\n\npresented  \"detailed  evidence\" of  his  health  problems to  the\n\ndistrict court, but never actively  \"argued\" for a lower sentence\n                                  \n\non the  basis of his physical  condition.  At most,  he contends,\n\nany request for a greater departure was \"implicit.\"\n\n                    \n\n     2Saubar   suffers  from  a   pre-offense  medical  condition\nrequiring kidney dialysis three times a week.  At sentencing, the\ndistrict court expressly acknowledged the seriousness of Saubar's\nphysical condition.\n\n     3Section  5H1.4 provides  that, though  \"physical condition\"\nnormally is not relevant to the sentencing decision, \"an extraor-\ndinary physical impairment may  be a reason to impose  a sentence\nbelow  the applicable  guideline range;  e.g., in  the case  of a\n                                             \nseriously infirm  defendant, home  detention may be  as efficient\nas, and less costly than, imprisonment.\"  U.S.S.G.   5H1.4.\n\n                                3\n\n          No matter which way Saubar turns, however, his claim is\n\nstymied.  If  he presented his \"physical  impairment\" argument to\n\nthe district  court at  sentencing, even implicitly,  he breached\n\nhis  plea agreement with the  government and was  not entitled to\n\nany  downward departure.    If he  did  not raise  his  precatory\n\n  5H1.4 argument at sentencing,  it is waived.
