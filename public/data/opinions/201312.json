José Antonio Fusté, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                        Selya, Lynch and Lipez,\n                            Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Melba N. Rivera-Camacho on brief for appellant.\n     H.S. Garcia, United States Attorney, Lisa E. Bhatia, Assistant\nU.S. Attorney, and Nancy B. Salafia, Assistant Regional Counsel,\nSocial Security Administration, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                            October 29, 2004\n\f           Per Curiam.   Claimant Ramonita Medina-Perez has appealed\n\na   district   court   judgment   affirming     the   decision   of     the\n\nCommissioner of Social Security which denied her application for\n\ndisability insurance benefits.     We affirm.\n\n           Claimant first argues that the Administrative Law Judge\n\n(\"ALJ\") failed to properly assess her credibility and did not\n\nsufficiently support his finding that the claimant's subjective\n\ncomplaints of pain were \"not totally credible.\" One of the reasons\n\nthe ALJ partially discounted the claimant's testimony was because\n\n\"the   claimant's   description   of    her   limitations   impresses    as\n\ninconsistent with the record when considered in its entirety.\"           We\n\nhave examined the record and find substantial evidence to support\n\nthe ALJ's finding of discrepancies between the claimant's testimony\n\nand the objective medical evidence.           These discrepancies amply\n\nsupport the ALJ's conclusion that the claimant was not totally\n\ncredible in respect to her subjective complaints of pain.\n\n           Claimant next argues that the ALJ did not properly\n\nconsider the medical evidence and substituted his opinion for those\n\nof the physicians on record.      We find claimant's argument without\n\nmerit.\n\n           Finally, claimant argues that the ALJ did not account for\n\nthe non-exertional limitations caused by her herniated discs,\n\ncarpal tunnel syndrome, and mental disorder. The ALJ, however, did\n\ntake her non-exertional limitations into account in finding that\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fshe was limited to a \"narrow range\" of light work.   Moreover, these\n\nfindings have substantial support in the record.\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.    See 1st\n\nCir. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                               -3-\n\f",
