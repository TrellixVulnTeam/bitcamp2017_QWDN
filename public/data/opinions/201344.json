Raymond L. Acosta, Senior U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                         Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n              Coffin and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n    Nicolas Nogueras, Jr. on brief for appellants.\n\n\n\n                           November 19, 2004\n\f           Per Curiam.   This appeal follows the entry of an order\n\ndismissing a suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 as time-barred.       Because\n\nthe district court erred in its calculation of the limitations\n\nperiod, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.\n\n           Plaintiff-appellant   Francisco   Chévere-Rodríguez   is   a\n\nformer employee of the municipality of Bayamón, Puerto Rico, and a\n\nself-styled   whistleblower.     Chévere-Rodríguez   claims   that   his\n\nwhistleblowing resulted in various acts of reprisal.      Following a\n\nconfrontation at the home of a municipal hierarch (defendant-\n\nappellee Inés Barnés Pagán), municipal officers arrested Chévere-\n\nRodríguez and prosecuted him on what he characterizes as trumped-up\n\ncharges.\n\n           At a trial in a Puerto Rico court, a petit jury cleared\n\nChévere-Rodríguez of all charges. The jury returned its verdict on\n\nAugust 13, 1999.   On August 14, 2000, Chévere-Rodríguez, on behalf\n\nof himself, his wife, and their conjugal partnership, instituted a\n\ncivil action in the United States District Court for the District\n\nof Puerto Rico.    He alleged, inter alia, that by fabricating the\n\ncriminal charges and falsely incriminating him, the town and the\n\nfour individual defendants (all municipal officials) had collogued\n\nto abrogate his civil rights in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983.1\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Chévere-Rodríguez subsequently filed an amended complaint,\ndropping the municipality as a party.\n\n                                 -2-\n\f           After   considerable    pretrial       skirmishing,   two    of   the\n\nindividual defendants, Barnés Pagán and Fuentes, moved for judgment\n\non the pleadings.       See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c).       They posited that\n\nthe action was time-barred.       The district court granted the motion\n\nand subsequently dismissed the action against the remaining two\n\ndefendants as well.\n\n           Following an unsuccessful motion for reconsideration,\n\nthis appeal ensued.      Chévere-Rodríguez has filed a brief but, for\n\nreasons that are not immediately apparent, the defendants have\n\nelected not to submit an opposing brief.\n\n           In Puerto Rico, the limitations period applicable to\n\nsection 1983 actions is one year.            See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, §\n\n5298(2);   see   also    Wilson   v.    Garcia,    471   U.S.    261,   278-80\n\n(characterizing section 1983 claims as \"personal injury actions\"\n\nand holding that state tort law supplies the applicable limitations\n\nperiod).   It cannot be gainsaid that the cause of action described\n\nin the amended complaint accrued on August 13, 1999 — the day that\n\nthe criminal jury exonerated Chévere-Rodríguez.2           See, e.g., Smith\n\nv. Holtz, 87 F.3d 108, 113 (3d Cir. 1996) (holding that a section\n\n1983 claim in the nature of malicious prosecution does not accrue\n\nwhile there is still a potential for judgment of conviction in the\n\n\n\n     2\n      To be sure, the amended complaint mentions several incidents\nleading up to the malicious prosecution. Chévere-Rodríguez does\nnot suggest, however, that any of those earlier incidents remain\nindependently actionable.\n\n                                       -3-\n\funderlying criminal case). The dispositive issue, then, is whether\n\nthe commencement date of the civil action — August 14, 2000 — falls\n\nwithin the one-year limitations period.\n\n            Chévere-Rodríguez's    timeliness   argument   has    two\n\ncomponents.    We examine each of them.\n\n            First, Chévere-Rodríguez asserts that the limitations\n\nclock did not begin to tick until August 14, 1999 (the day next\n\nfollowing the accrual date).      We agree with this assertion.   The\n\ncontrolling authority is our decision in Carreras-Rosa v. Alves-\n\nCruz, 127 F.3d 172 (1st Cir. 1997) (per curiam).           There, we\n\nconstrued Puerto Rico law as supporting the proposition that the\n\nlimitations period begins on the day following the date of accrual.\n\nId. at 175; see P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 1, § 72 (\"The time in which any\n\nact provided by law is to be done is computed by excluding the\n\nfirst day, and including the last . . . .\"); see also Yensip v.\n\nLufthansa German Airlines, 725 F. Supp. 113, 115 (D.P.R. 1989).3\n\n            The second component of Chévere-Rodríguez's argument\n\nbegins where the first component ends, that is, it starts with the\n\nassumption that the limitations period began to run on August 14,\n\n1999.    Since the year 2000 was a leap year, Chévere-Rodríguez had\n\n\n\n     3\n      In all events, the result would be the same under federal\nlaw. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 6 (a) (\"In computing any period of time\nprescribed or allowed by these rules, by the local rules of any\ndistrict court, by order of court, or by any applicable statute,\nthe day of the act, event, or default from which the designated\nperiod of time begins to run shall not be included.\").\n\n                                  -4-\n\f366 days in which to sue.          See Carreras-Rosa, 127 F.3d at 174.\n\nUnder ordinary circumstances, then, the last day for commencing a\n\ntimely action would have been August 13, 2000 (the 366th day of the\n\nlimitations period).        Because Chévere-Rodríguez did not sue until\n\nAugust 14, 2000, it is easy to see how the district court concluded\n\nthat his suit was \"one day late.\"\n\n              Appearances    can   be   deceiving,   however,   and   the\n\ncircumstances here are out of the ordinary because, in the year\n\n2000, August 13 fell on a Sunday.4           When the final day of a\n\ncomputed period of time prescribed or allowed by an applicable\n\nstatute for doing an act falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal\n\nholiday, the period is automatically extended to the next business\n\nday.       See Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a).    Consequently, Chévere-Rodríguez\n\nhad until Monday, August 14, 2000, to institute the suit.        Because\n\nhe filed his complaint with the district court on that date, he\n\ncommenced the action within the one-year limitations period.\n\n              We need go no further.       Based on the foregoing, we\n\nconclude that the district court erred in dismissing the instant\n\naction as time-barred.\n\n              Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      Although Chévere-Rodríguez's opposition to the motion to\ndismiss   did  not   emphasize  this  point,  his   motion for\nreconsideration harped on it.\n\n                                     -5-\n\f",
