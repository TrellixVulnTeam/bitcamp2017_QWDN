Nancy Gertner, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                                    Before\n\n                     Torruella, Selya and Lipez,\n                            Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Ali Addo, on brief pro se.\n     Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, and John A.\nCapin, Assistant U.S. Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                            December 30, 2003\n\f          Per Curiam.   Ali Hussein Addo has appealed his criminal\n\nconviction and sentence for one count of escape in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 751(a).   We affirm.\n\n           On appeal, Addo contends that his right to a speedy trial\n\npursuant to the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3161 et seq.,\n\n(hereinafter \"STA\") was violated and he is entitled to dismissal of\n\nthe indictment because, Addo alleges, he was not brought to trial\n\nwithin 70 days from the date of his first appearance before the\n\ncourt.   See 18 U.S.C. § 3161(c)(1).   Addo has waived any right to\n\ndismissal of the indictment because he failed to move for dismissal\n\nprior to trial on the ground that the government failed to bring\n\nhim to trial within 70 days.    See 18 U.S.C. § 3162(a)(2).\n\n          Addo claims that he invoked the STA at a hearing on\n\nOctober 31, 2001, but he is incorrect.    Addo's urging of an early\n\ntrial at that hearing was neither an expressed invocation of the\n\nSTA nor, more particularly, was it a motion to dismiss on STA\n\ngrounds for failure to bring him to trial within 70 days.     Although\n\nAddo did invoke the STA and requested a dismissal of the indictment\n\nin his closing trial argument, that motion came too late as waiver\n\noccurs unless the motion to dismiss on this ground comes prior to\n\ntrial. 18 U.S.C. § 3162(a)(2); see United States v. Bradfield, 113\n\nF.3d 515, 526 (5th Cir. 1997); United States v. Gomez, 67 F.3d\n\n1515, 1519 (10th Cir. 1995);    United States v. Alvarez, 860 F.2d\n\n801, 821-22 (7th Cir. 1988).    In any event, even were this claim\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fnot waived, the government has more than adequately demonstrated\n\nthat sufficient periods of time are properly excluded in computing\n\nthe 70 day period, such that no STA right was violated.\n\n          We have considered Addo's remaining claims on appeal and\n\nconclude that they are similarly without merit.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -3-\n\f",
