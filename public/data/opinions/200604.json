This      complex      political\n\ndiscrimination case was filed by eighty-two plaintiffs terminated\n\nfrom career employment positions with the municipality of Adjuntas\n\nin Puerto Rico.       The district court severed the plaintiffs into\n\nfour groups -- three groups of twenty and one group of twenty-two\n\n-- and the claims of the first twenty plaintiffs are now before us\n\non defendants' appeal from a substantial verdict for plaintiffs.\n\nAlthough this case raises many familiar issues, it also presents\n\nsome unusual questions arising from the court's initial severance\n\nof the plaintiffs, and its later decision to apply non-mutual\n\noffensive collateral estoppel to the three remaining pieces of the\n\nsevered litigation.         We vacate the court's collateral estoppel\n\norder, and affirm in all other respects.\n\n                                          I.\n\n            On November 12, 1997, eighty-two current and former\n\nemployees of the municipality of Adjuntas brought suit under 42\n\nU.S.C. ยง 1983, alleging violations of their First, Fifth and\n\nFourteenth Amendment rights arising from a massive layoff of\n\nmunicipal employees in the aftermath of the November 1996 mayoral\n\nelection.    Every claimant was fired from a \"career position\" (akin\n\nto   a   civil    service   job),    as    opposed    to   a   \"trust   position\"\n\n(political       appointment),      temporary    or    transitory       post,   or\n\n\"contract\" (fixed term) job. The plaintiffs named three defendants\n\nin the suit -- Roberto Vera Monroig (\"Vera\"), the mayor of Adjuntas\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\f(sued    in   both   his   individual     and   official    capacities);    Irma\n\nGonzalez, Adjunta's Director of Human Resources (sued in both her\n\nindividual     and   official   capacities);      and   the   municipality    of\n\nAdjuntas.1\n\n              On November 23, 1998, the district court issued an order\n\nand opinion denying absolute and/or qualified immunity to Mayor\n\nVera and Gonzalez in their individual capacities, and granting in\n\npart and      denying   in   part   the   defendants'      motion   for   summary\n\njudgment.      See Acevedo-Garcia v. Vera-Monroig, 30 F. Supp. 2d 141\n\n(D.P.R. 1998) (\"Acevedo I\").         In an opinion published February 17,\n\n2000, we affirmed the district court's order in all respects,\n\nruling inter alia that defendants could not claim the protection of\n\n     1\n      Defendants do not challenge the legal availability of\nmunicipal liability in this case. In Cordero v. De Jesus-Mendez,\n867 F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1989), we acknowledged the Supreme Court's\nholding in Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati, 475 U.S. 469 (1986) that\n\"municipality liability under ยง 1983 attaches where . . . a\ndeliberate choice to follow a course of action is made from among\nvarious alternatives by the official or officials responsible for\nestablishing final policy with respect to the subject matter in\nquestion.\"   Id. at 483-84 (emphasis added).    The Cordero court\nsubsequently noted that mayors in Puerto Rico are the government\nofficials ultimately responsible for the employment decisions of\nthe municipality:\n\n              Under Puerto Rico law, one of the express\n              powers given to mayors of municipalities is:\n              \"To appoint all the officials and employees of\n              the municipal executive branch, and remove\n              them from office whenever necessary for the\n              good   of  the   service,   pursuant  to   the\n              procedures provided herein.\" P.R. Laws Ann.\n              tit. 21, ch. 155 ยง 3002(15) (1980).\n\nId. at 7. Hence, Defendant Vera's employment decisions ipso facto\n\"constituted the official policy of the municipality.\" Id.\n\n                                        -3-\n\fabsolute immunity, and that we lacked jurisdiction to review the\n\ndistrict   court's     rulings       on   qualified    immunity     and   municipal\n\nliability.     See Acevedo-Garcia v. Vera-Monroig, 204 F.3d 1 (1st\n\nCir. 2000) (\"Acevedo II\").\n\n           Our      decision   in     Acevedo    II     cleared     the   remaining\n\nroadblocks     to    trial,    and    the    district       court   undertook   the\n\nformidable logistical task of arranging to try the multitude of\n\npolitical discrimination, political harassment, and due process\n\nclaims alleged by the eighty-two individual plaintiffs.2                   To this\n\nend, the court issued an order on October 11, 2001, severing the\n\ncase into four separate trials of twenty, twenty, twenty, and\n\ntwenty-two plaintiffs, respectively.             To configure the first group\n\nof twenty plaintiffs, the order directed each side to choose six\n\nplaintiffs with political discrimination and due process claims\n\nonly (for a total of twelve), and four plaintiffs prosecuting\n\npolitical discrimination, due process and political harassment\n\nclaims (for a total of eight).\n\n           The trial for this first group began October 12, 2001,\n\nand   lasted     twenty-three        days.      At    the    conclusion    of   the\n\nproceedings, the jury returned a verdict awarding each plaintiff a\n\n\n      2\n      All eighty-two plaintiffs alleged political discrimination\nand due process violations.      Thirty-three of the eighty-two\nplaintiffs added a third claim of political harassment to their\nlawsuit. The political discrimination and due process claims arose\nfrom the discharges themselves, while the political harassment\nclaims alleged shoddy treatment in the months preceding the\nterminations.\n\n                                          -4-\n\fpackage of compensatory and punitive damages totaling hundreds of\n\nthousands of dollars, summing to a group total of $6,956,400.\n\nAfter a flurry of post-trial motions, the court entered judgment on\n\nthe verdict.     It then issued an order on January 30, 2002, applying\n\nthe   doctrine    of   non-mutual   offensive   collateral   estoppel   to\n\npreclude defendants from litigating the defendants' liability for\n\npolitical discrimination and denial of the plaintiffs' due process\n\nrights.   Acevedo-Garcia v. Vera-Monroig, 213 F. Supp. 2d 38, 41\n\n(D.P.R. 2002).\n\n           Defendants filed a timely appeal after this first trial,\n\nchallenging inter alia the sufficiency of the evidence at the\n\nsummary judgment stage, the sufficiency of the evidence at trial,\n\nthe severance of plaintiffs into four groups, the district court's\n\ndenial of qualified immunity, numerous evidentiary rulings, the\n\ncourt's active participation at trial, the damage award, and the\n\ncourt's application of non-mutual offensive collateral estoppel.\n\nPlaintiffs cross-appealed from the district court's denial of an\n\ninjunction ordering the reinstatement of all plaintiffs.\n\n                                    II.\n\n           Acevedo I and Acevedo II provide a lengthy exposition of\n\nthe background facts in this case.        See Acevedo II, 204 F.3d at 4-\n\n7; Acevedo I, 30 F. Supp. 2d at 143-45.         We summarize those facts\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fhere, and supplement our recitation with an overview of the post-\n\nAcevedo II developments.3\n\nA.   Stipulated and Undisputed Facts\n\n             Defendant Vera, representing the Popular Democratic Party\n\n(\"PDP\"), won the November 1996 mayoral election in Adjuntas, and\n\nappointed Defendant Gonzalez, a fellow PDP member, to be the\n\nDirector of Human Resources on January 14, 1997. Vera and Gonzalez\n\ninherited a municipal government whose ranks were swelled by 115\n\nnew hires during the seven-year administration of Rigoberto Ramos,\n\nVera's predecessor, and a member of the rival New Progressive Party\n\n(\"NPP\").     Of those 115 employees, only 2 were affiliated with the\n\nPDP.       By January 1997, the municipality employed 229 regular\n\nemployees, and the parties stipulated prior to trial that \"many\n\ndepartments were so overstaffed that some employees did not have\n\ndesks.\"\n\n             On April 30, 1996, the Puerto Rico Comptroller's Office\n\npublished an audit report, M-96-14, indicating that Adjuntas had\n\naccrued annual budget deficits of at least $1,000,000 from 1985 to\n\n1990.      After Vera took office in January 1997, he commissioned a\n\nsecond financial audit of the municipality by Reinaldo Ramirez, a\n\ncertified public accountant.     Ramirez presented his report on May\n\n\n\n       3\n      The facts presented here are intended to convey a general\nimpression of the case. We provide additional facts in subsequent\nsections of the discussion where they are pertinent to the legal\nanalysis.\n\n                                  -6-\n\f8, 1997, informing city officials that the municipality had a\n\nbudget deficit of over $5,000,000 and long term debts totaling more\n\nthan $2,000,000.         Anticipating this unwelcome news, Vera had\n\npreviously hired a Human Resources Consulting firm in February 1997\n\nto prepare a \"Layoff Plan for Municipality of Adjuntas Employees\"\n\n(the \"Plan\").        The consultants completed the Plan in March 1997,\n\nand it received approval from the Adjuntas Municipal Assembly on\n\nApril    2,   1997    (as   required     under    Puerto    Rico's     Autonomous\n\nMunicipalities Act).         See 21 P.R. Laws Ann. ยง 4551, as amended\n\n(1995) (\"Law 81\").          On April 11, 1997, a copy of the Plan was\n\ncirculated to every municipal employee.\n\n              In broad strokes, the Plan (1) enumerated the steps the\n\nmunicipality was obliged to undertake before firing employees\n\n(including      relocation,      retraining,       temporary     unpaid    leave,\n\ndemotions to vacant positions, and voluntary retirement); (2)\n\nestablished an order of priority for laying off municipal workers;\n\nand     (3)   established    a   series      of   procedures     for   earmarking\n\nparticular employees and job classifications for termination, and\n\nfor providing notice to the affected individuals. The Plan was not\n\nself-executing.         Instead,    it    authorized       the   termination   of\n\nmunicipal employees \"[w]hen the Mayor determines that there are\n\nfinancial problems and that as a result, programs or services are\n\nbeing affected.\"        The Mayor made this determination in May 1997\n\nafter conferring with Ramirez and the Human Resource consultants,\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fand he ordered city officials to implement the Plan.           When the dust\n\nsettled on October 31, 1997, 102 employees, including 82 NPP\n\nmembers and 11 PDP members, had been fired from their career\n\npositions.\n\n           Since   January   1,   1997,    the     municipality   has   hired\n\nseventy-seven new employees to \"contract\" or fixed-term jobs funded\n\nthrough non-municipal sources (i.e. federal and state programs).\n\nThe most significant of these programs, referred to as \"Law 52,\"\n\nallows municipalities to present job training proposals to the\n\nLabor Department of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, which may then\n\nappropriate funds on an annual basis to underwrite the salaries of\n\na certain number of municipal employees that the city could not\n\notherwise afford.    Only five of the eighty-two plaintiffs received\n\none of these seventy-seven appointments, the vast majority of which\n\nwent to PDP members.\n\nB.   Contested Facts\n\n             The trial featured a contentious dispute regarding the\n\nperiod preceding     the   October   31,   1997,    layoffs.      The   twenty\n\nplaintiffs in the first trial group testified that, during this\n\nperiod,   the   defendants   sabotaged     their    working    conditions   by\n\ndenying NPP employees (and only NPP employees) basic amenities,\n\nincluding phone privileges, short work breaks for breakfast, access\n\nto restroom facilities, and the opportunity to drive municipal\n\nvehicles to perform their job functions. Many plaintiffs testified\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fthat they were removed from their jobs entirely, and sent to random\n\nlocations where they were either given nothing to do for months on\n\nend or else ordered to perform menial tasks outside the scope of\n\ntheir job descriptions.    The defendants denied these allegations,\n\ncontending that prior abuses of telephone privileges and municipal\n\nvehicles had contributed to large budget overruns that compelled\n\nthe municipality to restrict access to these services.             According\n\nto defendants, the dearth of functioning bathroom facilities was a\n\nconsequence of plumbing and physical infrastructure deficiencies\n\nthat were ignored during the previous NPP mayoral administrations.\n\n            There was also a factual controversy concerning the\n\nimplementation of the Plan.         The defendants insisted that the\n\nparticular layoff scheme developed in accordance with the Plan was\n\npolitically neutral in both its conception and implementation.\n\nNoting that prior NPP administrations had almost exclusively hired\n\nNPP members to fill over a hundred municipal positions in the\n\npreceding years, they claimed it was inevitable that a seniority-\n\nbased layoff plan would disproportionately impact NPP employees.\n\n            Plaintiffs presented evidence of a different agenda.          In\n\ntheir   view,   Mayor    Vera    manipulated     the   Plan   to     produce\n\ndiscriminatory results in three ways.            First, he contravened\n\nprovisions of the Plan by failing to seriously consider measures\n\nshort of outright termination, including relocation, retraining,\n\ntemporary    unpaid   leave,    demotions   to   vacant   positions,     and\n\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fvoluntary          retirement.4     Second,    the    layoff    scheme   developed\n\npursuant to the Plan tied termination to seniority within job\n\nclassifications,           rather   than      seniority     across     the   board.\n\nHypothetically, under this scheme, an NPP librarian with seven\n\nyears of seniority could be laid off while a PDP office clerk with\n\nfive years of seniority retained her position.                  Vera's scheme thus\n\neschewed the possibility of retraining veteran NPP employees to\n\ntake over the jobs of less senior PDP members with jobs requiring\n\na similar skill set (but bearing a different classification),\n\nthereby exacerbating the discriminatory impact of the layoffs.\n\nThird, the seniority system employed by defendants incorporated a\n\nfixed years-of-service threshold -- eight years and ten months --\n\nthat       dated    back   precisely   to     the    end   of   the   previous   PDP\n\nadministration in Adjuntas.            In other words, any employee with\n\neight years and ten months of seniority (or more) was immune from\n\nthe layoffs.          Accordingly, PDP members hired during that previous\n\nadministration were insulated from the layoffs, while all employees\n\n\n       4\n           Article X of the Lay Off Plan provides:\n\n       If the layoff is due to lack of funds, it must be\n       evaluated if it is possible to generate savings through\n       means other than requiring the elimination of permanent\n       positions.   If the crisis is temporary, to consider\n       reducing the work day and granting unpaid leaves. To\n       consider, additionally, if it is feasible to retrain\n       employees in other functions or relocate them to other\n       positions within or outside the Municipality.\n\nArticle X, Layoff Plan for Municipality of Adjuntas Employees\n(March 1997).\n\n                                        -10-\n\fhired thereafter (during the intervening NPP administrations) were\n\nat risk of termination.\n\n             Finally, there was evidence that Vera contrived to shed\n\nNPP employees with sufficient seniority to withstand the initial\n\nround   of   layoffs   by   simply    eliminating   their   job   category\n\naltogether. For example, if an NPP member employed as a \"Citizens'\n\nAffairs Specialist\" outranked his PDP colleagues on the seniority\n\nscale, the municipality would eliminate the Citizens' Affairs\n\nSpecialist position entirely, and then hire back the former PDP\n\nCitizens' Affairs Specialists under the auspices of Law 52 or some\n\nother employment program funded by outside sources.\n\n                                     III.\n\n             As a preliminary matter, we note that our review of the\n\nlegal issues in this case is handicapped considerably by the\n\ndefendants' failure to produce transcripts of the second half of\n\nthe trial.     The defense began presenting its case on October 29,\n\nand the court issued its instructions to the jury on November 19.\n\nThe only record of the defendants' case in chief before us is a\n\nsmall excerpt of Mayor Vera's direct testimony on October 30, and\n\nan excerpt of CPA Ramirez's direct testimony on November 6.            The\n\ninformative value of even these tidbits is reduced substantially by\n\nthe defendants' failure to provide a transcript of the cross-\n\nexamination of these witnesses by plaintiffs' counsel.\n\n             Rule 10 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure\n\nclearly states that \"[i]f the appellant intends to urge on appeal\n\n                                     -11-\n\fthat a finding or conclusion is unsupported by the evidence or is\n\ncontrary to the evidence, the appellant must include in the record\n\na   transcript     of   all    evidence   relevant      to    that   finding   or\n\nconclusion.\"       Fed. R. App. P. 10(b)(2).             Elaborating on this\n\nrequirement, we have admonished appellants \"with a regulatory\n\nbordering on the monotonous\" that\n\n            [t]his rule imposes a duty upon an appellant\n            to print all of the evidence, good and bad,\n            material to the point he wishes to raise.\n            Should an appellant spurn this duty and drape\n            an incomplete record around the court's neck,\n            the court in its discretion either may\n            scrutinize the merits of the case insofar as\n            the record permits, or may dismiss the appeal\n            if absence of a full transcript thwarts\n            intelligent review.    In this vein, we have\n            held . . . that, should the record provided on\n            appeal preclude us from reaching a reasoned\n            determination on the merits, it is the\n            appellant who must bear the brunt of an\n            insufficient record on appeal.\n\nMoore v. Murphy, 47 F.3d 8, 10-11 (1st Cir. 1995) (internal\n\ncitations and quotations omitted); see Scarfo v. Cabletron Sys.,\n\nInc., 54 F.3d 931, 963 (1st Cir. 1995); United States v. One Motor\n\nYacht Named Mercury, 527 F.2d 1112, 1113 (1st Cir. 1975).\n\n            We are left with no choice but to confine our review of\n\ndefendants' challenges to those claims adequately grounded in the\n\nportions of the record produced on appeal.                As we work our way\n\nthrough    their    manifold    claims    of   error,    we    identify   those\n\nchallenges that we are unable to evaluate owing to the procedural\n\ndefault.\n\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fA.   Pre-Trial Rulings\n\n1.   Sufficiency of the evidence at the summary judgment stage\n\n            In   partially   denying   defendants'   motion    for   summary\n\ndisposition of plaintiffs' political discrimination claims, the\n\ndistrict court offered the following explanation for its ruling:\n\n            Plaintiffs have put forth sufficient evidence\n            to   sustain    their   initial    burden   that\n            Defendants' employment decisions were based on\n            improper     and    discriminatory      motives.\n            Defendants have, however, put forth evidence\n            in support of their burden that regardless of\n            Plaintiffs'    political     affiliation,    the\n            municipal   budgetary    crisis   required   the\n            municipality to cut jobs on the basis of\n            seniority . . . . The Court finds that this\n            proffer   of    evidence   is    sufficient   to\n            demonstrate that regardless of political\n            affiliation, Defendants would have made the\n            same decision in laying off Plaintiffs.\n\nAcevedo I, 30 F. Supp. 2d at 154.         Defendants contend that this\n\nfinding     mandated   the    dismissal    of   plaintiffs'      political\n\ndiscrimination claims under the rule established in Mt. Healthy\n\nCity Sch. Dis. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 287 (1977), and\n\ninsist that the district court erred in shifting the burden of\n\nproof back to plaintiffs to demonstrate that \"they would not have\n\nbeen fired 'but for' their political affiliation.\"            Acevedo I, 30\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 154 (citing Rodriguez-Pinto v. Tirado-Delgado, 982\n\nF.2d 34, 39 (1st Cir. 1993); Aviles-Martinez v. Monroig, 963 F.2d\n\n2, 5 (1st Cir. 1992)).          The court compounded its error, in\n\ndefendants' view, by postponing a final ruling on plaintiffs'\n\npolitical    discrimination     claims    pending    the   submission     of\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\fadditional evidence from plaintiffs to demonstrate that they were\n\nqualified to fill the seventy-seven new positions created by the\n\nmunicipality after January 1, 1997.             Defendants argue that the\n\ncourt was obliged to rule in their favor on the basis of the\n\ninsufficient evidence currently before it.\n\n              These objections are unavailing. When a district court's\n\nassessment of the evidentiary record at the summary judgment stage\n\nis subsequently \"overtaken\" by a full trial and verdict, it is our\n\npractice not to revisit that determination on appeal:\n\n              We need not address the merits of [a]\n              preverdict challenge to the sufficiency of the\n              evidence on the motion for summary judgment.\n              Such an attack on the denial of defendant's\n              motion   for  summary   judgment   \"has   been\n              overtaken by subsequent events, namely, a\n              full-dress trial and an adverse jury verdict\"\n              . . . The rationale for this rule has been\n              based on the procedural fact that denial of a\n              motion for summary judgment \"is merely a\n              judge's determination that genuine issues of\n              material fact exist.   It is not a judgment,\n              and does not foreclose trial on issues on\n              which summary judgment was sought.\" Hence, a\n              challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence\n              adduced on the motion to support the district\n              court's conclusion that genuine issues of\n              material fact exist will not lie on appeal.\n\nEastern Mountain Platform Tennis, Inc. v. Sherwin-Williams Co., 40\n\nF.3d   492,    500   (1st   Cir.   1994)    (internal    citations   omitted).\n\nAccordingly, any sufficiency of the evidence challenge on appeal\n\nmust be grounded in the record as a whole.              Here, defendants also\n\nargue that the trial record considered in its entirety did not\n\n\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fsupport the jury verdict, and we address that claim later in the\n\ndiscussion.\n\n2.   Severance\n\n            On October 11, 1997, the district court severed the case\n\ninto four separate trials, finding that\n\n            it is not practical or just to subject one\n            jury panel to a trial in which 82 plaintiffs\n            with varying claims will be testifying.   No\n            single jury panel would be able to remember\n            all of the testimony and evidence or be able\n            to reach a fair and impartial verdict at the\n            end of that time. It is the opinion of this\n            Court that severance will most likely result\n            in   a  just   final  disposition   of  this\n            litigation.\n\nThe defendants objected on numerous grounds, arguing inter alia\n\nthat the court's proposal (1) precluded defendants from eliciting\n\ncontradictory testimony among plaintiffs, (2) imposed increased\n\nexpense     and   inconvenience     on    defendants   by     compelling      the\n\nexamination of expert witnesses and government officials on four\n\noccasions    rather   than   one,   (3)   reduced   the     likelihood   of    an\n\nimpartial jury for the second, third and fourth plaintiff groups,\n\nand (4) hampered defendants' ability to portray the relevant events\n\nto the jury in a comprehensive fashion.          On October 15, the court\n\nemphatically rejected these concerns in a written ruling:\n\n            The considerations alleged by Defendants as to\n            the fact that they would have to present\n            evidence at four different occasions is of\n            secondary    importance.       \"A    paramount\n            consideration    at   all    times    in   the\n            administration of justice is a fair and\n            impartial     trial    to    all    litigants.\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\f           Considerations of economy of time, money and\n           convenience of witnesses must yield thereto.\"\n\nAcevedo-Garcia v. Vera-Monroig, 240 F.R.D. 26, 30 (D.P.R. 2001)\n\n(quoting In re Bendectin Litigation, 857 F.2d 290, 308 (6th Cir.\n\n1988)).\n\n           Defendants lodge two objections to the severance on\n\nappeal. First, they argue that the district court's refusal to try\n\nthe claims of all eighty-two plaintiffs at once was inappropriate\n\nand unfairly prejudicial.          We can dispense with this argument\n\nquickly.     The decision to separate parties or claims is a case\n\nmanagement determination \"peculiarly within the discretion of the\n\ntrial court,\" Gonzalez-Marin v. Equitable Life Assurance Socy., 845\n\nF.2d 1140, 1145 (1st Cir. 1998), and courts of appeals accord broad\n\nlatitude to district courts in this area.                  Id.; Applewhite v.\n\nReichold Chems., Inc., 67 F.3d 571, 574 (5th Cir. 1995); New York\n\nv. Hendrickson Bros., Inc., 840 F.2d 1065, 1082 (2d Cir. 1988).                  We\n\nwould note, however, that we need not rest our affirmance on this\n\ndeferential standard of review -- the circumstances of this case\n\ncompel the    conclusion    that    the    division   of     plaintiffs    was   a\n\nlegitimate    and   feasible   means      of   efficiently    conducting       this\n\nunwieldy litigation.\n\n           Defendants' second objection is more troublesome, and\n\nimplicates    the   particular     procedural     device     employed     by    the\n\ndistrict   court    to   quarter   the     proceedings.        \"Two   types      of\n\nseverances or separations of claims are contemplated by the Federal\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\fRules of Civil Procedure -- one within the action itself, the other\n\nresulting in a second, or new action.\" Official Comm. of Unsecured\n\nCreditors v. Shapiro, 190 F.R.D. 352, 354 (E.D. Pa. 2000).   Rule 21\n\nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure furnishes the mechanism for\n\nseparating a case into separate actions, i.e, severance: \"Parties\n\nmay be dropped or added by order of the court on motion of any\n\nparty or of its own initiative at any stage of the action and on\n\nsuch terms as are just.   Any claim against a party may be severed\n\nand proceeded with separately.\"    Fed. R. Civ. P. 21; see 9 Charles\n\nAlan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure ยง\n\n2387 (1971); 88 C.J.S. Trial ยง 17 (2003) (\"A severance occurs when\n\na lawsuit is divided into two or more separate and independent or\n\ndistinct causes.\").   Rule 42(b), on the other hand, authorizes\n\ncourts to divide a single action into separate trials that remain\n\nunder the umbrella of the original solitary action:\n\n          The court, in furtherance of convenience or to\n          avoid prejudice, or when separate trials will\n          be conducive to expedition and economy, may\n          order a separate trial of any claim, cross-\n          claim, counterclaim, or third-party claim, or\n          of any separate issue or of any number of\n          claims, cross-claims, counterclaims, third-\n          party claims, or issues.\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 42(b); see 9 Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and\n\nProcedure ยง 2387; 88 C.J.S. Trial ยง 17 (\"An order for a separate\n\ntrial keeps the lawsuit intact while enabling the court to hear and\n\ndecide one or more issues without trying all of the controverted\n\nissues at the same hearing.\").\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\f           The salient distinction between these two procedural\n\ndevices concerns the appealability of an order terminating the\n\nproceedings in a partitioned piece of the litigation:\n\n           The judgment in a severed action is final,\n           enforceable and appealable when it disposes of\n           all parties and issues. Conversely, the order\n           entered at the conclusion of a separate trial\n           is often interlocutory because a final and\n           appealable judgment cannot be rendered until\n           all of the controlling issues have been tried\n           and decided.\n\n88 C.J.S. Trial ยง 17; see White v. ABCO Eng'g Corp., 199 F.3d 140,\n\n145 n.6 (3d Cir. 1999); 9 Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and\n\nProcedure ยง 2387 (1971) (\"Separate trials usually will result in\n\none   judgment,    but   severed     claims   become     entirely    independent\n\nactions       to   be    tried,      and      judgment     entered      thereon,\n\nindependently.\").\n\n              Courts often confuse these two procedural devices.              \"The\n\nprocedure authorized by Rule 42(b) should be distinguished from\n\nseverance under Rule 21 . . . . Unfortunately, this distinction,\n\nclear enough in theory, often is obscured in practice since at\n\ntimes   the     courts   talk   of    'separate    trial'    and     'severance'\n\ninterchangeably.\"        9   Wright    &   Miller,     Federal     Practice   and\n\nProcedure ยง 2387; see McDaniel v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 987 F.2d\n\n298, 304 (5th Cir. 1993).          Here, defendants argue that the court\n\ncommitted reversible error by invoking Rule 42(b) as the basis for\n\npartitioning the plaintiffs into four groups while conducting the\n\nproceedings as if they had been severed under Rule 21.\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\f          The district court addressed the distinction between Rule\n\n42(b) and Rule 21 in its October 15 decision:\n\n             In the instant motion, Defendants contend that\n             severance of actions is covered by Rule 21 of\n             the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and not\n             by Rule 42(b). This distinction is of little\n             consequence because both rules provide the\n             Court with wide discretion to order severance\n             . . . . The Court's determination as to\n             whether it should sever the claims of\n             Plaintiffs under Rule 21 or whether it should\n             order separate trials under Rule 42 requires\n             the same considerations, and are within the\n             broad discretion of the District Court.\n\nAcevedo-Garcia, 204 F.R.D. at 29-30. Although the court accurately\n\nobserved that it had wide discretion to manage the litigation under\n\neither rule, the particular procedural device it employed is of\n\nparamount importance in this appeal.         Because our jurisdiction is\n\nlimited to \"all final decisions of the district courts of the\n\nUnited States,\" United States v. Leichter, 160 F.3d 33, 35 (1st\n\nCir. 1998) (emphasis added), we cannot exercise jurisdiction over\n\nan appeal from a separate trial ordained under Rule 42(b).             See In\n\nre Licht & Semonoff, 796 F.2d 564, 569 (1st Cir. 1986) (\"A 'final\n\ndecision' is ordinarily one which disposes of all the rights of all\n\nthe parties to an action.\") (emphasis added).                Moreover, since\n\nseparate trials do not individually produce final judgments, any\n\nattempt to apply collateral estoppel to the remaining three trials\n\nwould be invalid under a Rule 42(b) regime.           See NLRB v. Donna-Lee\n\nSportswear Co., 836 F.2d 31, 33-34 (1st Cir. 1987) (noting that one\n\n\"essential    element   which   must   be   present    for   the   successful\n\n\n                                   -19-\n\fapplication of issue preclusion\" is that \"the determination must\n\nresult in a valid and final judgment.\") (emphasis added); Griffin\n\nv. Burns, 570 F.2d 1065, 1072 (1st Cir. 1978) (same); Restatement\n\n(Second) of Judgements ยง 27 (same).\n\n          As defendants concede, this is not a case where the\n\ndistrict court's intentions were ambiguous. See McDaniel, 987 F.2d\n\nat 304. The district court's order of October 11 explicitly states\n\nthat \"[e]ach Judgment entered at the end of each of these four\n\ntrials shall be final and appealable and published and subject to\n\nall motions provided by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, such\n\nas 'new trial,' 'judgment notwithstanding the verdict', etc.\"\n\nAdditionally, in its opinion rejecting defendants' objections to\n\nthe severance, the court reasoned that\n\n          conducting separate trials wherein the jury\n          verdict   from each    trial   is  final   and\n          appealable as to each set of Plaintiffs\n          facilitates judicial economy and possible\n          settlement in this case by providing the\n          parties with some scale or model upon which to\n          re-assess whether further litigation would be\n          prudent or advantageous to their cause.\n\nAcevedo-Garcia, 204 F.R.D. at 30.   Thus, the court's references to\n\nRule 42(b) notwithstanding, its clearly articulated intent was to\n\nsever the plaintiffs pursuant to Rule 21.       The Third Circuit\n\nobserved in White that \"[n]othing on the face of Rule 21 indicates\n\nthat it must be explicitly invoked in order to have effect.   There\n\nmust be, however, a strong indication that the judge intended to\n\neffect a severance.\"   White, 199 F.3d at 145 n.6 (citing Allied\n\n\n                              -20-\n\fElevator, Inc. v. E. Tex. State Bank of Buna, 965 F.2d 34, 36 (5th\n\nCir. 1992)).      That intent is manifest from the language of the\n\ncourt's October 11 order. Accordingly, we find no reversible error\n\nin the court's severance ruling under Rule 21, and we regard the\n\ndistrict court's entry of judgment on the verdict below as a final\n\nand appealable judgment under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1291.5\n\nB.   The Trial\n\n1.   Evidentiary rulings\n\n            Plaintiffs aptly characterize the defendants' challenges\n\nto   the   district    court's   evidentiary    rulings   as    \"rambling,\"\n\n\"discursive\"     and   \"unrefined.\"      Defendants'   briefs   narratively\n\nrecite a plethora of offending rulings in a scattershot format\n\ndevoid of legal authority, citations to analogous cases, or any\n\napplication of law to facts.            Many of defendants' challenges\n\n\n\n     5\n      There is a potential argument, disavowed by defendants here,\nthat Rule 21 (entitled \"Misjoinder and Non-Joinder of Parties\") is\nnot applicable to cases where there has been no improper joinder of\nparties at the outset. However, the prevailing rule in our sister\ncircuits is that a finding of misjoinder is not a prerequisite to\nsevering parties or claims under Rule 21. As the Second Circuit\nobserved in Wyndham Assoc. v. Bintliff, 398 F.2d 614 (2d Cir.\n1968):\n\n     Rule 21 . . . provides that \"Any claim against a party\n     may be severed and proceeded with separately.\"       We\n     believe that this provision authorizes the severance of\n     any claim, even without a finding of improper joinder,\n     where there are sufficient other reasons for ordering a\n     severance.\n\nId. at 618; see Safeco Ins. Co. v. City of White House, 36 F.3d\n540, 545-46 (6th Cir. 1994) (characterizing this principle as the\nmajority rule).\n\n                                      -21-\n\freference evidentiary    rulings    and/or   courtroom   exchanges   that\n\noccurred during their own case in chief, and hence are procedurally\n\ndefaulted as a consequence of their failure to produce the relevant\n\ntranscripts.    The briefs also leave uncertain which of the dozens\n\nof evidentiary challenges raised on appeal were properly preserved\n\nbelow.   See Reyes-Garcia v. Rodriguez & Del Valle, Inc., 82 F.3d\n\n11, 14 (1st Cir. 1996).       With one exception, the evidentiary\n\nchallenges that survive these procedural defects lack the developed\n\nargumentation needed to trigger review on the merits.           \"We have\n\nsteadfastly deemed waived issues raised on appeal in a perfunctory\n\nmanner, not accompanied by developed argumentation.\"        Mulvihill v.\n\nTop-Flite Golf Co., 335 F.3d 15, 27 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n          The   one   evidentiary    challenge   that    does   merit our\n\nattention is the defendants' contention that the court improperly\n\nadmitted evidence about claims not at issue -- namely, political\n\nharassment claims filed by particular plaintiffs that the court had\n\nearlier dismissed.    Defendants correctly point out that, in some\n\ncases, evidence of previously dismissed claims may have an undue\n\ntendency to suggest a decision on an improper basis.        However, the\n\nSupreme Court has ruled that such evidence is not ipso facto\n\ninadmissible, noting that \"[a] discriminatory act which is not made\n\nthe basis for a [] charge . . . may constitute relevant background\n\nevidence in a proceeding in which the status of a current practice\n\nis at issue.\"    United Air Lines, Inc. v. Evans, 431 U.S. 553, 558\n\n(1977); see O'Rourke v. City of Providence, 235 F.3d 713, 726 (1st\n\n                                   -22-\n\fCir. 2001); Morrison v. Carleton Woolen Mills, Inc., 108 F.3d 429,\n\n439 (1st Cir. 1997).      We find no abuse of discretion in the\n\ndistrict court's decision to admit this evidence as relevant\n\nbackground \"to show the atmosphere in which [plaintiffs] lived and\n\ndeveloped since Mayor Vera was elected Mayor.\"\n\n2.   Active participation of the court\n\n           Defendants allege that at various junctures during the\n\ntrial the district court inaccurately and prejudicially commented\n\non the evidence, truncated the defendants' cross-examination of\n\nseveral plaintiffs, and chastised defense witnesses in front of the\n\njury.      As we have previously observed, it is well settled that\n\nthe trial judge \"has a perfect right -- albeit a right that should\n\nbe exercised with care -- to participate actively in the trial\n\nproper.\"   Logue v. Dore, 103 F.3d 1040, 1045 (1st Cir. 1997).   \"A\n\ntrial judge retains the common law power to question witnesses and\n\nto comment on the evidence . . . . An inquiry into the judge's\n\nconduct of the trial necessarily turns on the question of whether\n\nthe complaining party can show serious prejudice.\"   United States\n\nv. Gonzalez-Soberal, 109 F.3d 64, 72 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n           We reiterate that the complaints grounded in defendants'\n\ncase in chief are defaulted on the basis of an inadequate record.\n\nDefendants also fail to demonstrate \"serious prejudice\" arising\n\nfrom the court's participation during plaintiffs' case in chief.\n\nThis was a lengthy and contentious trial featuring dozens of\n\nwitnesses, numerous sidebar conferences, and a myriad of other\n\n                               -23-\n\fprocedural delays arising, inter alia, from the inartful labeling\n\nand introduction of exhibits, translation difficulties, and a\n\ncontinuing stream of objections from both parties.                      Under these\n\nchallenging circumstances, the court's efforts to accelerate the\n\npace of the trial with infrequent commentary on the evidence and\n\nthe occasional prodding of witnesses were amply justified and well\n\nwithin its discretion. See Rosario-Diaz v. Gonzalez, 140 F.3d 312,\n\n315 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"The Civil Rules endow judges with formidable\n\ncase-management authority . . . . In exercising this power, trial\n\njudges enjoy great latitude.\") (citations omitted).\n\nC.   Post-Trial Rulings\n\n1.   Qualified Immunity\n\n            The Supreme Court has recognized that qualified immunity\n\nembodies \"an entitlement not to stand trial or face the other\n\nburdens   of   litigation,      conditioned       on    the   resolution    of   the\n\nessentially    legal    question    whether       the    conduct   of    which   the\n\nplaintiff complains violated clearly established law.\" Mitchell v.\n\nForsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 526 (1985).              Defendants' efforts to invoke\n\nthe protections of qualified immunity at the summary judgment\n\nstage,    however,     were    rejected    by    the    district   court,     which\n\nconcluded that \"[p]laintiffs [] proffered evidence of a triable\n\nissue of fact regarding a potentially discriminatory application of\n\nthe Layoff Plan . . . . Therefore, Defendants are not entitled to\n\nqualified   immunity     for    their     allegedly     discriminatory      actions\n\nmerely because they assert they acted pursuant to [the Layoff\n\n                                        -24-\n\fPlan].\"   Acevedo I, 30 F. Supp. 2d at 149.          As previously noted, we\n\ndismissed    defendants'      interlocutory       appeal   from     this   ruling,\n\ndetermining that we lacked jurisdiction to review the factual\n\ngrounds for the district court's denial of qualified immunity.\n\nAcevedo II, 204 F.3d at 10.\n\n             After the jury returned its verdict, defendants renewed\n\ntheir challenge to the court's denial of qualified immunity,6\n\narguing   that   in   light    of   the   facts    elicited    at    trial,    \"the\n\nunlawfulness of implementing a layoff plan duly approved by the\n\nmunicipal legislature according to seniority would not have been\n\napparent to a reasonable official.\" (citing Harlow v. Fitzgerald,\n\n457   U.S.   800,   818   (1982)).        The   court   once   again       rejected\n\ndefendants' claim, concluding that the jury's findings foreclosed\n\nthe availability of immunity:\n\n             For the record, the prohibition against\n             political    discrimination     was    clearly\n             established in 1997 when Defendants acted to\n             violate Plaintiffs' constitutionally protected\n             rights.    A jury trial was held wherein\n             Plaintiffs presented evidence that supported\n             their allegations of political discrimination.\n             The evidence led the Jury to conclude that\n             political   affiliation    was   in   fact   a\n             substantial or motivating factor for Mayor\n             Vera Monroig's and Irma Gonzalez's actions . .\n             . . Therefore, the qualified immunity argument\n             that Defendants now make is simply an attempt\n\n\n\n      6\n      Where defendants continue to assert qualified immunity after\nundergoing trial on a ยง 1983 claim, a post-trial grant of immunity\nwould still confer a benefit by shielding them from any liability\nfor monetary damages awarded by the jury. See Roldan-Plumey v.\nCerezo-Suarez, 115 F.3d 58, 65 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n                                     -25-\n\f          to re-write the facts and re-litigate this\n          case.\n\n          Defendants allege two errors in the district court's\n\npost-verdict denial of qualified immunity.      First, they claim that\n\nthe court erred in failing to deliver two proposed instructions on\n\nqualified immunity to the jury:\n\n1.        Proposed Jury Instruction 51: Qualified Immunity\n\n          Government officials performing discretionary functions\n          are granted qualified immunity from civil claims for\n          damages, if their conduct at the time of the alleged acts\n          that give rise to the civil damages \"does not violate\n          clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of\n          which a reasonable person would have known.\"          The\n          relevant inquiry \"is the objective question whether a\n          reasonable officer could have believed the actions\n          alleged by the plaintiff herein\" to be lawful, in light\n          of clearly established law and the information the state\n          official possessed.\n\n2.        Proposed   Jury   Instruction   53:      Reach of Qualified\n          Immunity\n\n          Even defendants who violate constitutional rights enjoy\n          a qualified immunity that protects them from liability\n          for damages unless it is further demonstrated that their\n          conduct was unreasonable with respect to clearly\n          established rights and laws at the time of the conduct at\n          issue.\n\nAfter proposing these instructions, defendants concede that they\n\nfailed to object on the record to the court's refusal to issue the\n\ninstructions before the jury retired to deliberate.      Accordingly,\n\nwe review for plain error only.    See Chestnut v. City of Lowell,\n\n305 F.3d 18, 20 (1st Cir. 2002) (en banc) (\"Failures to object,\n\nunless a true waiver is involved, are almost always subject to\n\nreview for plain error.\"); Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules\n\n\n                                -26-\n\fof Civil Procedure, Report of the Civil Rules Advisory Committee\n\n62-68 (March 14, 2001), revised Jul. 31, 2001 (modifying Rule 51 of\n\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to provide for plain error\n\nreview of challenges to jury instructions where the claim was not\n\nproperly preserved).\n\n          The availability of qualified immunity after a trial is\n\na legal question informed by the jury's findings of fact, but\n\nultimately committed to the court's judgment.     \"When the case goes\n\nto trial, the jury itself decides the issues of historical fact\n\nthat are determinative of the qualified immunity defense, but the\n\njury does not apply the law relating to qualified immunity to those\n\nhistorical facts it finds; that is the court's duty.\"        Johnson v.\n\nBreeden, 280 F.3d 1308, 1318 (11th Cir. 2002); see Singh v. Blue\n\nCross/Blue Shield of Mass., 308 F.3d 25, 34 (1st Cir. 2002); Swain\n\nv. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 1997).    Accordingly, there was\n\nno error, let alone plain error, in the district court's refusal to\n\nsubmit the proposed qualified immunity instructions to the jury.\n\n          Defendants   also   contend   that   the   court   committed\n\nreversible error when it failed to grant a new trial or judgment\n\nnotwithstanding the verdict on the basis of qualified immunity.\n\nThey reinforce this second claim of error with two legal arguments.\n\nFirst, they assert that the district court misapplied the second\n\nprong of the familiar three-pronged qualified immunity test:\n\n          Determining whether qualified immunity is\n          available to a particular defendant at a\n          particular  time   requires a  trifurcated\n\n                                -27-\n\f           inquiry. We ask, first, whether the plaintiff\n           has alleged the violation of a constitutional\n           right.    If so, we then ask whether the\n           contours of the right were sufficiently\n           established at the time of the alleged\n           violation.    Finally, we ask whether an\n           objectively reasonable official would have\n           believed that the action taken or omitted\n           violated that right.\n\nHatch v. Dept. for Children, Youth and their Families, 274 F.3d 12,\n\n20 (1st Cir. 2001).     Defendants contend that the court erroneously\n\ncharacterized the \"constitutional right\" at issue as plaintiffs'\n\nright not to be discriminated against on the basis of their\n\npolitical beliefs during the implementation of the layoff plan.\n\nThey decry the excessive abstractness of this \"right,\" citing\n\nlanguage   from   the   Supreme   Court's      decision    in    Anderson    v.\n\nCreighton, 483 U.S. 635 (1987):\n\n           The operation of this standard depends\n           substantially upon the level of generality at\n           which the relevant \"legal rule\" is to be\n           identified . . . . If [referring to the right\n           to due process of law] the test of \"clearly\n           established law\" were to be applied at this\n           level of generality, it would bear no\n           relationship   to    the   \"objective   legal\n           reasonableness\" that is the touchstone of\n           Harlow. Plaintiffs would be able to convert\n           the rule of qualified immunity that our cases\n           plainly establish into a rule of virtually\n           unqualified liability simply by alleging a\n           violation of extremely abstract rights.\n\nId. at 639; see Rivera-Ramos v. Roman, 156 F.3d 276, 279-80 (1st\n\nCir. 1998).    It is difficult to divine from defendants' briefs how\n\nthey   would   articulate   the   right   at    issue     --    the   pertinent\n\ndiscussion is geared exclusively to demonstrating the absence of\n\n\n                                  -28-\n\fany clearly established rule regulating the implementation of\n\nseniority-based layoff plans. Of course, this approach commits the\n\nAnderson fallacy in reverse by construing the relevant rights/rules\n\nwith such specificity that the predictably scant jurisprudence on\n\npoint would never satisfy the \"clearly established\" threshold.\n\n             In the end, their argument is unavailing.            The clearly\n\nestablished    law     both    in   this   circuit   and   beyond    precludes\n\ngovernment officials from discharging civil or \"career\" employees\n\nfor politically-motivated reasons.           See Branti v. Finkel, 445 U.S.\n\n507 (1980); Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347 (1976); Roldan-Plumey, 115\n\nF.3d at 65-66; Jirau-Bernal v. Agrait, 37 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.\n\n1994).   The complexity of the municipality's workforce reduction\n\nplan suggests that it was conceived by the Adjuntas municipal\n\nassembly as a politically neutral means of responding to the city's\n\nfiscal crisis. Yet the jury could reasonably have found that while\n\nthe   Plan    itself     was    politically     neutral,    the     method   of\n\nimplementation revealed the defendants' discriminatory intent.\n\n             Defendants also raise a challenge under the third prong\n\nof Hatch, relying on stipulated facts painting a bleak picture of\n\nthe municipality's financial status, see supra, and the conclusory\n\nassertion that \"the aforementioned set of circumstances clearly\n\ndemonstrate that defendants acted within the reasonable boundaries\n\nof their duties under the lay-off plan.\"             In limiting their focus\n\nto the objective circumstances surrounding the implementation of\n\nthe Plan, defendants misconceive the salient inquiry under the\n\n                                      -29-\n\fthird prong of the qualified immunity analysis.                 As we observed in\n\nTang v. State of Rhode Island, 120 F.3d 325 (1st Cir. 1997):\n\n          The   objective    test   focuses    on   the\n          reasonableness of the official's conduct\n          independent of motive. It is rarely going to\n          be manifestly unreasonable, judged apart from\n          motive, to [take certain action against] an\n          employee.       But   because    of   special\n          constitutional or statutory protections, some\n          motives can convert [those decisions] into\n          causes of action.\n\nId. at 327 (emphasis in original).                Indeed, we recognized in\n\nAcevedo II that illicit motive is the touchstone of a political\n\ndiscrimination   claim:     \"The   plaintiffs       allege       that   they   were\n\nterminated because of their political affiliation, a constitutional\n\nclaim that has no meaning absent the allegation of impermissible\n\nmotivation.\"   Acevedo II, 204 F.3d at 11; see Stella v. Kelley, 63\n\nF.3d 71, 74-75 (1st Cir. 1995).          Here, as plaintiffs point out,\n\n\"the jury verdict necessarily rejected the claim that the seniority\n\nsystem was a politically neutral method for implementing the Layoff\n\nPlan.\"\n\n          Finally,      defendants   insist       that    the    Supreme   Court's\n\ndecision in Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194 (2001), establishes \"a\n\nmargin   for   errors    and   expands      the    zone     of    protection     in\n\ndiscretionary determinations where an official reasonably believed\n\nthat he acted reasonably although [he] was later found to have\n\nacted unlawfully.\"       The district court aptly disposed of this\n\nargument below by distinguishing Saucier on its facts:\n\n\n\n                                     -30-\n\f          Saucier involved a military police officer's\n          mistaken but reasonable belief that excessive\n          force was needed to protect the Vice President\n          of   the  United   States   from  an   unknown\n          demonstrator. Because high security measures\n          are needed to safeguard a United States Vice\n          President, because the degree of danger posed\n          by the demonstrator was unknown, and because\n          law enforcement officers are usually required\n          to   make   split-second,   life   and   death\n          decisions, the Court held that the officer\n          acted reasonably . . . Mayor Vera Monroig and\n          Irma Gonzalez acted over a 10-month period of\n          time. As they had a long period within which\n          to assess the situation, the probability that\n          they could have made a \"reasonable mistake\" as\n          in the case of an officer guarding the Vice\n          President, is largely diminished.\n\nAccordingly, we conclude that the district court did not err in\n\ndenying defendants' post-verdict request for qualified immunity.\n\n2.   Sufficiency of the evidence\n\n          After the jury issued its verdict, defendants moved for\n\njudgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b), or in the alternative\n\nfor a new trial pursuant to Rule 59.    The district court denied\n\nboth avenues of relief, and defendants appealed.   A party seeking\n\nrecourse under either rule faces an uphill battle:\n\n          In reviewing the denial of a motion for\n          directed     verdict    or    for     judgment\n          notwithstanding the verdict \"we must examine\n          the evidence in the light most favorable to\n          the plaintiff and determine whether there are\n          facts and inferences reasonably drawn from\n          those facts which lead to but one conclusion -\n          - that there is a total failure of evidence to\n          prove plaintiff's case.\"\n\nGutierrez-Rodriguez v. Cartagena, 882 F.2d 553, 558 (1st Cir. 1989)\n\n(quoting Mayo v. Schooner Capital Corp., 825 F.2d 566, 568 (1st\n\n\n                               -31-\n\fCir. 1987)).      When considering a Rule 59(a) motion, \"a district\n\ncourt may set aside a jury's verdict and order a new trial only if\n\nthe verdict is against the demonstrable weight of the credible\n\nevidence or results in a blatant miscarriage of justice.\"                 Sanchez\n\nv. Puerto Rico Oil Co., 37 F.3d 712, 717 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n             Defendants' failure to produce the transcripts from their\n\nown case in chief precludes review of their sufficiency of the\n\nevidence challenges.       It is well-settled that a court must review\n\na sufficiency of the evidence challenge against the backdrop of the\n\nrecord as a whole.     See United States v. McLaughlin, 957 F.2d 12,\n\n18 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"In reviewing the record for a sufficiency of\n\nthe evidence appeal, it is well established that the evidence must\n\nbe examined in its entirety . . . \"); N.Y. State Elec. & Gas Corp.\n\nv.   Sec'y   of   Labor,   88   F.3d   98,     108   (2d   Cir.   1996)   (\"[T]he\n\nsufficiency of the evidence is tested on appeal by viewing the\n\nentire record.\").     As noted above, Rule 10 of the Federal Rules of\n\nAppellate     Procedure     requires      an    appellant     contesting      the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence on appeal to \"include in the record a\n\ntranscript of all evidence relevant to that finding or conclusion.\"\n\nFed. R. App. P. 10(b)(2).        Our previous jurisprudence establishes\n\nthat the evidence \"relevant\" to a finding of sufficiency (or lack\n\nthereof) is the record as a whole.            Since \"it is the appellant who\n\nmust bear the brunt of an insufficient record on appeal,\" Moore, 47\n\nF.3d at 11, we must conclude that defendants have procedurally\n\ndefaulted their sufficiency of the evidence challenges.\n\n                                       -32-\n\f3.   Damages\n\n           Rule 59(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\n\npermits a party aggrieved by the jury verdict to move \"to alter or\n\namend the judgment\" within ten days after entry of judgment.             Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 59(e).       Pursuant to Rule 59(e), the defendants filed a\n\ntimely motion seeking reduction or remittitur of the damage award\n\nfor each plaintiff. Where defendants properly preserve a challenge\n\nto the amount of compensatory damages awarded by the jury, \"our\n\ninquiry is limited to determining 'whether the trial court abused\n\nits discretion in refusing to set aside the verdict as excessive.'\"\n\nAnthony v. G.M.D. Airline Servs., Inc., 17 F.3d 490, 493 (1st Cir.\n\n1994) (quoting McDonald v. Fed. Labs., Inc., 724 F.2d 243, 246 (1st\n\nCir. 1984)).        The review of a preserved challenge to a punitive\n\ndamages award \"is de novo, and the award will stand unless we find\n\nit 'certain' that the amount in question exceeds that necessary to\n\npunish and deter the alleged misconduct.\"            Romano v. U-Haul Int'l,\n\n233 F.3d 655, 672 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n           These       deferential    standards      of   review   implicitly\n\nrecognize that \"[t]ranslating legal damage into money damages --\n\nespecially     in    cases   which   involve   few   significant    items   of\n\nmeasurable economic loss -- is a matter peculiarly within the\n\njury's ken.\"        Gutierrez-Rodriguez v. Cartagena, 882 F.2d 553, 577\n\n(1st Cir. 1989); see Brown v. Freedman Baking Co., 810 F.2d 6, 11\n\n(1st Cir. 1987) (\"We rarely will override the jury's judgment on\n\nthe appropriate amount of damages to be awarded.\"); Segal v.\n\n                                      -33-\n\fGilbert Color Systems, Inc., 746 F.2d 78, 81 (1st Cir. 1984) (\"This\n\ncourt has consistently declined to play Monday morning quarterback\n\nin reviewing a jury's assessment of damages.\").          Consequently,\n\ndefendants bear the onerous burden of proving to our satisfaction\n\nthat the damage award was \"grossly excessive, inordinate, shocking\n\nto the conscience of the court, or so high that it would be a\n\ndenial of justice to permit it to stand.\"      Correa v. Hospital San\n\nFrancisco, 69 F.3d 1184, 1197 (1st Cir. 1995) (quoting Segal, 746\n\nF.2d at 81).\n\n          The district court issued a strong endorsement of the\n\njury verdict in rejecting defendants' Rule 59(e) motion below:\n\n          The Court believes that the Jury considered\n          all of the evidence presented, and fashioned\n          their award in light of Plaintiffs' economic\n          damages, and damages resulting from pain and\n          suffering.    Simply put, the verdict was not\n          against    the   weight   of   the   evidence.\n          Considering the significant disruptions which\n          Defendants' actions caused the Plaintiffs'\n          lifestyles, the Court does not find that the\n          compensatory and punitive damages award for\n          each individual Plaintiff . . . is grossly\n          excessive or inordinate.       Further, after\n          weighing the evidence, the Court finds that\n          the damage award also does not shock the\n          conscience.\n\nAcevedo-Garcia, 213 F. Supp. 2d at 53.         On appeal, defendants\n\nreiterate their objections to the jury verdict as excessive.      They\n\nalso raise a new argument that was not submitted to the district\n\ncourt -- namely, that the jury's award of compensatory damages for\n\ndue   process   violations   was     duplicative   of   the   political\n\ndiscrimination damages also awarded as part of the verdict.\n\n                                   -34-\n\f          a.    Duplicate damages\n\n          This argument, which is premised on an error of law, has\n\nmore force than defendants' factually grounded claim of excessive\n\ndamages. Before addressing the consequences of defendants' failure\n\nto preserve this argument below, we examine the merits of the claim\n\nitself.\n\n          By way of background, the jury award was broken down into\n\nfive components for the eight plaintiffs alleging discrimination,\n\ndue process violations and harassment:\n\n          (1)     Due process violations;\n          (2)     Political   discrimination   in  the  form   of\n                  harassment;\n          (3)     Political discrimination resulting in dismissal\n                  causing pain and suffering;\n          (4)     Political discrimination resulting in dismissal\n                  causing loss of earnings; and\n          (5)     Punitive damages\n\nFor the twelve plaintiffs alleging only political discrimination\n\nand due process injuries, the jury award contained all of the above\n\ncomponents except (2).7\n\n\n     7\n      The individual damage awards for each plaintiff are too\nlengthy to list here.      As a general matter, there was some\nuniformity among the damage awards. For category (1), all twenty\nplaintiffs received $75,000 in compensatory damages from Defendant\nVera and $75,000 from Defendant Gonzalez. Every plaintiff also\nreceived $15,000 in punitive damages from Defendant Vera and\n$15,000 in punitive damages from Defendant Monroig.\n     Categories (2), (3), and (4) produced some variation. For the\neight plaintiffs alleging political harassment, the jury found that\nfour had failed to prove political harassment, and awarded no\ndamages in this category. Two plaintiffs received $50,000, and the\nother two received $75,000.     Finally, the awards for pain and\nsuffering ranged from $75,000 to $150,000, and the awards for lost\nearnings ran the gamut from zero damages awarded to $55,000 (all\nawards in this category reflected varying percentage reductions for\n\n                                -35-\n\f            Defendants     point     out     that    plaintiffs'     Fourteenth\n\nAmendment due process claims arise from the municipality's failure\n\nto offer the claimants alternatives to outright termination.                   The\n\nconsequences of this denial of due process include the normal\n\ninjuries    associated     with    removal    from   a   secure    job    --   lost\n\nearnings, pain and suffering associated with unemployment, lost\n\nfuture   income,    etc.     Defendants       contend    that     their   alleged\n\nviolation    of   defendants'      First     Amendment   rights     resulted    in\n\nprecisely the same harms. Because the jury essentially compensated\n\nplaintiffs for their unemployment injuries twice -- once under a\n\nFirst Amendment theory and once under a Fourteenth Amendment theory\n\n-- defendants argue that the court erred as a matter of law in\n\nentering judgment on a \"double award\" for the same injury.\n\n            It is well-settled that double awards for the same injury\n\nare impermissible.

Moreover, Congress intended for compensatory damages in\n\nsection 1983 cases to remedy only actual injuries caused by a\n\ndeprivation of constitutional rights, and not \"the abstract 'value'\n\nof [] due process and First Amendment rights.\"              Memphis Community\n\nSch.

The Supreme\n\nCourt elaborated in Stachura that\n\n\n\n\nrequired mitigation of damages).\n\n\n                                      -36-\n\f          when ยง 1983 plaintiffs seek damages for\n          violations of constitutional rights, the level\n          of damages is ordinarily determined according\n          to principles derived from the common law of\n          torts . . . . Congress adopted this common-law\n          system of recovery when it established\n          liability    for    \"constitutional    torts.\"\n          Consequently, \"the basic purpose\" of ยง 1983\n          damages is \"to compensate persons for injuries\n          that are caused by the deprivation of\n          constitutional rights.\"\n\n\nId. at 306-07 (quoting Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247, 254 (1978)).\n\nConsequently,    any    duplication   problem      cannot    be   resolved   by\n\nconceptualizing First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment violations\n\nas distinct \"injuries\" warranting separate compensation.\n\n          In defending the jury verdict, plaintiffs argue that the\n\ndamages awarded for the due process violations were retrospective\n\nin nature, designed to compensate the claimants for wages lost from\n\nthe date of dismissal to the date of the verdict.            By contrast, the\n\ncompensatory damages awarded for defendants' Fourteenth Amendment\n\nviolations    were     forward-looking      and   intended   to    remedy    the\n\nplaintiffs'    lost    property   rights8    in   their   career    employment\n\npositions.    Specifically, plaintiffs argue that\n\n             because career employment carries with it an\n             expectancy of continued income prospectively\n             (front pay), retirement and medical insurance\n\n     8\n      Puerto Rico law grants career employees a property interest\nin their government positions: \"Regular career employees are those\nwho have entered the system after undergoing the recruitment\nprocedure established in this subtitle, including the probational\nperiod. These employees shall be entitled to permanent status and\nmay only be removed from their positions for just cause after due\nfiling of charges.\" 21 P.R.

This award is legally\n             distinguishable    in    that   it    represents\n             compensation for prospective losses, from the\n             date of the trial forward, whereas political\n             discrimination    damages     are     calculated\n             retroactively from the date of trial.\n\nWe agree with plaintiffs that both front and back pay are valid\n\nelements     of    a   compensatory      damage    award    under      section    1983.\n\nIndeed, \"compensatory damages may include not only out-of-pocket\n\nloss   and    other     monetary     harms,       but   also    such    injuries        as\n\n'impairment of reputation . . ., personal humiliation, and mental\n\nanguish and suffering.'\"          Stachura, 477 U.S. at 307 (quoting Gertz\n\nv. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 350 (1974)); see Davet v.\n\nMaccarone, 973 F.2d 22, 29 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n             In support of their argument that the jury apportioned\n\nits compensatory damage awards between the First Amendment and\n\nFourteenth        Amendment    violations,      plaintiffs      refer     us   to      the\n\n\"Political Discrimination\" section of the special verdict form,\n\nwhich directs the jury to \"indicate the amount of back pay to date\n\n[plaintiff]        should     receive\"   if     political      affiliation       was    a\n\nsubstantial or motivating factor in his/her dismissal (emphasis\n\nadded).    Yet there is no analogous reference to front pay in either\n\nthe jury instructions or the due process section of the verdict\n\nform, which simply provides that \"[u]nder the law you may choose to\n\naward damages for a violation of due process.                     If you answered\n\n\n\n                                         -38-\n\f'YES' to the previous question [addressing liability], state the\n\namount   of    damages   this   Plaintiff   should   be   awarded   from\n\n[defendants]\" (emphasis added).\n\n          Moreover, plaintiffs' theory of apportionment arguably\n\nsuffers from another flaw. If the jury had found defendants guilty\n\nof either a due process violation or a First Amendment violation,\n\nbut not both, plaintiffs would still be entitled to front pay, back\n\npay, and pain and suffering, because the singular violation would\n\nstill have resulted in the loss of career employment and any\n\nsecondary harms flowing from that loss.      Put differently, nothing\n\ninherent in the nature of a due process violation limits the\n\nresulting economic injury to front pay, and nothing inherent in an\n\nact of political discrimination inflicts an injury that is limited\n\nto back pay.\n\n          Finally, we note that the court's duplicative damage\n\ninstruction was worded so as to suggest that the relevant \"injury\"\n\nthat could not be doubly compensated was the violation of a\n\nconstitutional right, rather than an actual loss or harm.\n\n          In awarding damages you should be careful not\n          to award duplicate damages. Plaintiffs are\n          entitled to collect full compensation for\n          their injuries if proved, but they must not\n          collect more than once for the same wrong . .\n          . . Again, each plaintiff is entitled to\n          collect full compensation for his or her\n          injury but the plaintiff must not collect more\n          than once for the same wrong.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -39-\n\f(emphasis added).       The court's use of the term \"wrong,\" read in\n\nconjunction with a special verdict form divided into separate\n\nsections for each constitutional violation, may have led the jury\n\nto     conceptualize    the   term   \"injury\"      as   the   violation     of     a\n\nconstitutional right vel non, rather than an actual loss caused by\n\nthe violation of that right.          See Stachura, 477 U.S. at 306-07;\n\nCarey, 435 U.S. at 254.       Possibly, in the absence of more detailed\n\ninstructions supporting plaintiffs' front pay/back pay theory, the\n\njury     may    have   erroneously    awarded      duplicative        damages     by\n\ncompensating plaintiffs for the same actual losses under both a due\n\nprocess and political discrimination theory of liability.                         We\n\nacknowledge, therefore, that the lack of clarity in the court's\n\nduplicative      damages   instruction      was   obvious     error    which     may\n\npotentially have resulted in an improper award of double damages.\n\n               We must now decide whether defendants are entitled to\n\nrelief in the face of this error.                 Defendants were on notice\n\nthroughout the proceedings that plaintiffs were seeking recovery for\n\nboth due process violations and political discrimination.                  To the\n\nextent that a jury award on both claims would be duplicative, the\n\nproper practice is to ensure that the verdict form is structured so\n\nas to allow the jury to recompense the plaintiffs' injuries just\n\nonce.     As we observed in Britton v. Murphy, 196 F.3d 24, 32 (1st\n\nCir. 1999):\n\n               The problem of guarding against double\n               recovery is a familiar one when multiple\n\n\n                                     -40-\n\f           claims exist but separate damages on each\n           would be partly or wholly duplicative. If the\n           parties explicitly agree that the damages\n           should be the same on each claim, then it is\n           easy    enough     to    construct    special\n           interrogatories that identify separate bases\n           for liability but have only a single line for\n           damages. On the other hand, when the amounts\n           awarded could conceivably differ depending on\n           the claim but may also involve some overlap,\n           verdict forms sometimes require a separate\n           specification of damages for each claim on\n           which the jury determines liability, leaving\n           it to the judge to make the appropriate\n           adjustments to avoid double recovery.\n\nId. (internal   citation   omitted).   Defendants   could   also   have\n\nrequested jury instructions that clearly directed the jury to\n\ncompensate the plaintiffs' unemployment injuries just once.        Here,\n\ndefendants failed to lodge a pertinent objection to either the jury\n\ninstructions or the verdict form. Even after the jury delivered its\n\nsizeable verdict, defendants never submitted a post-trial motion\n\nchallenging the actual award as duplicative. Accordingly, we review\n\nthe appellants' allegation of duplicative damages for plain error\n\nonly.    See Chestnut, 305 F.3d at 20 (verdict form); M & I Heat\n\nTransfer Prods. v. Gorchev, 141 F.3d 21, 23 (1st Cir. 1998) (jury\n\ninstructions); Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure, Report of the Civil Rules Advisory Committee 62-68;\n\nsupra.\n\n           \"We apply the plain error doctrine 'in exceptional cases\n\nor under peculiar circumstances to prevent a clear miscarriage of\n\njustice . . . [or] where the error seriously affected the fairness,\n\n\n\n                                -41-\n\fintegrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.'\"               Rocafort\n\nv. IBM Corp., 334 F.3d 115, 122 (1st Cir. 2003)             (citing Beatty v.\n\nMichael Bus. Machs. Corp., 172 F.3d 117, 121 (1st Cir. 1999).                   Our\n\nprevious cases reflect a marked reluctance to find plain error in\n\ncivil cases: \"[E]specially in a civil case this is a very hard test\n\nto meet because over and above plain error, it requires a showing\n\nboth of prejudice and a miscarriage of justice or something of this\n\nmagnitude.\"   Fraser v. Major League Soccer, L.L.C., 284 F.3d 47, 62\n\n(1st Cir. 2002) (citing Davis v. Rennie, 264 F.3d 86, 100-01 (1st\n\nCir. 2001), cert. denied, 123 S.Ct. 118 (2002)).\n\n            Defendants' claim for relief from the alleged double\n\ndamages founders on the prejudice prong of the plain error standard.\n\nIn reaching this conclusion, we are in no way trivializing the\n\nconsequences of this verdict for the municipality of Adjuntas and\n\nthe   individual     defendants.      The     jury    returned    a   verdict    of\n\n$6,956,400, of which $6,356,400 (the total jury award, excluding\n\npunitive damages)9 was against a municipality whose entire annual\n\nbudget in 1996-97 was only $4,529,327.           See Exhibit 2, Defendants'\n\nStatement of Uncontested Facts (July 17, 1998).                   Moreover, this\n\nfigure    reflects    the   damages    owed    only    to   the    first    twenty\n\nplaintiffs;    sixty-two     plaintiffs      remain    in   the    queue.       But\n\n\"prejudice,\" as that term is incorporated into the plain error test,\n\n\n      9\n      In City of Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., 458 U.S. 247\n(1981), the Supreme Court ruled that municipalities are immune from\npunitive damages under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. See id. at 271.\n\n                                      -42-\n\frequires a strong causal link between the harm to the aggrieved\n\nparty and the legal error. At best, defendants can only demonstrate\n\nthe   possibility   that    faulty   jury    instructions      resulted   in   a\n\nduplicative damage award.\n\n            Indeed,   the   appellate    materials     set   forth   competing\n\nexplanations for the jury's award of damages under both a due\n\nprocess and First Amendment theory of liability.             Appellants argue\n\nthat the compensatory damages awarded under each theory doubly\n\nrecompensed claimants for their actual losses, while appellees\n\ninsist that the jury compensated plaintiffs for their total loss\n\njust once, but divided that single award between the due process and\n\nFirst Amendment causes of action.        Nothing in this record precludes\n\nthat possibility, or rules out other appropriate bases for the jury\n\naward.   For defendants who fail to protect themselves on the record\n\nby    requesting   jury   instructions      and/or   special   verdict    forms\n\nstructured to preclude the possibility of a double damage award,\n\nthese possibilities are fatal to a request for plain error relief.\n\nThe \"prejudice\" component of the plain error standard implies a\n\nstringent demonstration of causation.          Thus, in Chestnut v. City of\n\nLowell, our decision to vacate a punitive damage award on plain\n\nerror review rested in part on the finding that \"[p]rejudice in the\n\nsense of affecting the final outcome is . . . obvious:           had the jury\n\nbeen instructed as to the City's immunity [from punitive damages]\n\nthere almost certainly would not be a $500,000 judgment against it\n\n\n\n                                     -43-\n\ftoday, although conceivably the jury might have somewhat increased\n\nthe compensatory damages.\"              Chestnut, 305 F.3d at 20 (emphasis\n\nadded).      Here,       although      we   can    speculate   that    the    court's\n\ninstructions may have led the jury to erroneously award duplicative\n\ndamages,   we     have    no    concrete     basis   for   accepting    defendants'\n\ncharacterization of the jury award.                Under these circumstances, we\n\ndecline to expand the rule of Chestnut to encompass cases in which\n\nprejudice to the aggrieved party is not manifest on the face of the\n\nrecord.\n\n             b.    Excessive damages\n\n             Defendants meticulously document the economic damages\n\nawarded to each plaintiff, and argue mathematically that the totals\n\nin every case exceed the lost wages (reduced by the appropriate\n\npercentage for mitigation).             As a threshold matter, the magnitude\n\nof the claimed discrepancy is sufficiently small (ranging from\n\n$2,607.94 to $10,900.00) to preclude a finding that the verdict was\n\n\"grossly excessive, inordinate, shocking to the conscience of the\n\ncourt, or so high that it would be a denial of justice to permit it\n\nto stand.\"        Correa, 69 F.3d at 1197; Segal, 746 F.2d at 81.\n\nFurthermore,      the    jury    was    entitled     to   consider    any   secondary\n\neconomic injuries flowing from the plaintiffs' loss of earnings and\n\nemployment benefits. See Stachura, 477 U.S. at 307; Davet, 973 F.2d\n\nat 29.     For example, nearly every claimant testified that they\n\nrelied entirely on their monthly earnings to cover the expenses of\n\n\n\n                                            -44-\n\frunning their household, meet their mortgage obligations, pay their\n\nchildrens' tuition, etc.         As a consequence of losing their jobs,\n\nplaintiffs were forced to seek additional bank loans, dip into their\n\nsavings, and make other costly financial adjustments to cover these\n\nexpenses.\n\n            We also decline to set aside the damages awarded in the\n\nother three categories (pain and suffering resulting from political\n\nharassment,    pain    and   suffering    resulting   from   dismissal,    and\n\npunitive damages).       Damages for pain and suffering defy \"exact\n\nmathematical computation,\" Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc. v. Amirault,\n\n202 F.2d 893, 898 (1st Cir. 1953); and \"are not susceptible to proof\n\nby a dollar amount,\" Mejias-Quiros v. Maxxam Property Corp., 108\n\nF.3d 425, 428 (1st Cir. 1997).          The jury's awards of non-economic\n\ncompensatory damages and punitive damages were moderate in scope and\n\nwell within acceptable bounds.           The individualized nature of the\n\ntwenty    verdicts    reflects   the   jury's   careful   attention   to   the\n\npeculiar circumstances of each plaintiff, and evinces the jury's\n\ndesire to craft an appropriate award for each claimant.10\n\n\n\n\n     10\n      Plaintiffs argue on appeal that \"[t]he due process award\neffectively was the monetary equivalent of reinstatement. Should\nthat award be taken away or significantly reduced by this court,\nplaintiffs will not have been made whole for their due process\ninjuries.\" Our decision to affirm that award moots plaintiffs'\ncross appeal from the district court's denial of reinstatement.\n\n                                       -45-\n\fD.   Non-Mutual Offensive Collateral Estoppel\n\n            On January 30, 2002, the district court issued an order\n\nprecluding the defendants from relitigating (with respect to the\n\nremaining sixty-two plaintiffs) the following three issues that were\n\ndeterminative of defendantsโ liability in the first trial:\n\n      (1)   That political affiliation was a substantial or\n            motivating factor in the implementation of the lay-off\n            plan.\n\n      (2)   That Defendants violated Plaintiffsโ due process rights\n            by implementing the lay-off plan in a discriminatory\n            fashion.\n\n      (3)   That Plaintiffs were discharged from their career\n            positions with the Municipality of Adjuntas on account of\n            their political affiliation; and other individuals were\n            employed to perform their duties under different titles,\n            and under different programs, in violation of the law.\n\nAcevedo-Garcia, 213 F. Supp. 2d at 40.         This ruling, if allowed to\n\nstand, would confine the scope of the subsequent three trials to the\n\nissue of damages.      Not surprisingly, defendants vigorously dispute\n\nthe courtโs application of collateral estoppel, raising a host of\n\nobjections that we consider in due course.\n\n            As   a    threshold   matter,   neither   party   disputes   our\n\njurisdiction     to   review   the   court's   application    of   collateral\n\nestoppel.    This case presents unique circumstances, however, that\n\ncall into question the ripeness of the collateral estoppel question.\n\nSee Pustell v. Lynn Pub. Sch., 18 F.3d 50, 51 n.1 (1st Cir. 1994)\n\n(observing that we may raise issues of jurisdiction sua sponte).\n\nGenerally, a court will determine that collateral estoppel is\n\n\n                                     -46-\n\fappropriate within the very proceeding where the ruling is to have\n\nits preclusive effect.      Here, the district court announced its\n\nattention to apply collateral estoppel at the end of Trial 1, but\n\nthe court's ruling will have no preclusive effect until Trials 2,\n\n3, and 4, which are not currently before us.    Because these trials\n\nwere severed into four independent proceedings pursuant to Rule 21,\n\nsee supra, any resolution of the collateral estoppel question will\n\nhave no effect on the rights of the parties as they pertain to Trial\n\n1.   See Cotter v. City of Boston, 323 F.3d 160, 173 (1st Cir. 2003)\n\n(\"Article III's cases and controversies language prohibits federal\n\ncourts from issuing advisory opinions.      A court may not decide\n\nquestions that cannot affect the rights of litigants in the case\n\nbefore it.\") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n           In the end, however, we conclude that we have jurisdiction\n\nto review the district court's application of collateral estoppel.\n\nThe four cases comprising this matter began as a single lawsuit.\n\nThe boundaries that now divide it into four severed cases are not\n\ntemporal or transactional in nature.   Instead, they are a judicial\n\nartifice imposed pursuant to the court's case management authority\n\nunder Rule 21 to streamline the proceedings in the subsequent three\n\ntrials.    That the court chose to issue its collateral estoppel\n\nruling at the at the end of Trial 1 rather than the beginning of\n\nTrial 2 in no way attenuates the finality of the order or the force\n\nof its preclusive effect.\n\n\n\n                                -47-\n\f          Moreover, neither party disputes that the district court\n\n-- the same court that is presiding over the subsequent trials --\n\nhas entered a final order decreeing that non-mutual offensive\n\ncollateral estoppel will be enforced in the subsequent three cases.\n\nThe contours of the order are clear from its language, and the\n\nattorneys who litigated the issue below and now on appeal are the\n\ncounsel of record for plaintiffs and defendants in all four matters.\n\nThe district court's order bound the defendants as of its entry of\n\nJanuary 30, and the application of collateral estoppel in the\n\nsubsequent   trials   is    a   certainty   beyond   any   speculation.\n\nAccordingly, there is no compelling reason for us to delay our\n\nreview of the collateral estoppel question until the judgment in\n\nTrial 2 is appealed.       If, as a consequence of sidestepping the\n\ncollateral estoppel issue now, we belatedly reversed the district\n\ncourt's estoppel ruling at that late stage, we would unnecessarily\n\nvoid a burdensome litigation that is currently slated to involve\n\ntwenty plaintiffs and forty-eight claims. Disclaiming jurisdiction\n\nover the district court's collateral estoppel ruling under these\n\ncircumstances would vindicate form over substance, to the detriment\n\nof both parties and the district court.     See Schneider v. Lockheed\n\nAircraft Corp., 658 F.2d 835, (D.C. Cir. 1981) (\"The potential\n\nfuture use of collateral estoppel in the remaining cases requires\n\nthat we address these arguments in the interest of sound judicial\n\nadministration.\").\n\n\n\n                                  -48-\n\f           The brand of collateral estoppel applied by the district\n\ncourt -- non-mutual offensive collateral estoppel -- historically\n\nspawned the greatest misgivings among jurists. Prior to the Supreme\n\nCourtโs decision in Blonder-Tongue Labs. v. Univ. of Ill. Found.,\n\n402   U.S. 313 (1971), many courts adhered to the doctrine       of\n\nโmutuality of estoppel,โ which ordained that โunless both parties\n\n(or their privies) in a second action are bound by a judgment in a\n\nprevious case, neither party (nor his privy) in the second action\n\nmay use the prior judgment as determinative of an issue in a second\n\naction.โ   Id. at 320-21; see Triplett v. Lowell, 297 U.S. 638, 644\n\n(1936); Restatement of Judgments ยง 93 (1942) (โ[A] person who is not\n\na party or privy to a party to an action in which a valid judgment\n\n. . . is rendered (a) cannot directly or collaterally attack the\n\njudgment, and (b) is not bound by or entitled to claim the benefits\n\nof an adjudication upon any matter decided in the action.โ).11   The\n\nBlonder-Tongue Court determined that the traditional rationales\n\n\n\n\n      11\n      In the case at bar, the application of collateral estoppel\nis โnon-mutualโ in the sense that the sixty-two plaintiffs\nbenefitting from the pre-determination of liability were not\nparties in the trial of the first twenty plaintiffs, where the\nliability question was originally litigated.\n\n                               -49-\n\fundergirding the mutuality requirement12 were unavailing in the face\n\nof weightier institutional concerns:\n\n             In any lawsuit where a defendant, because of\n             the mutuality principle, is forced to present\n             a complete defense on the merits to a claim\n             which the plaintiff has fully litigated and\n             lost in a prior action, there is an arguable\n             misallocation of resources. To the extent the\n             defendant in the second suit may not win by\n             asserting, without contradiction, that the\n             plaintiff   had    fully   and    fairly,   but\n             unsuccessfully, litigated the same claim in the\n             prior suit, the defendant's time and money are\n             diverted from alternative uses -- productive or\n             otherwise -- to relitigation of a decided\n             issue. And, still assuming that the issue was\n             resolved correctly in the first suit, there is\n             reason to be concerned about the plaintiff's\n             allocation of resources. Permitting repeated\n             litigation of the same issue as long as the\n             supply of unrelated defendants holds out\n             reflects either the aura of the gaming table or\n             โa lack of discipline and of disinterestedness\n             on the part of the lower courts, hardly a\n             worthy or wise basis for fashioning rules of\n             procedure.โ\n\nId. at 329 (quoting Kerotest Mfg. Co. v. C-O Two Co., 342 U.S. 180,\n\n185 (1952)).     The excerpted language from Blonder-Tongue endorses\n\n     12\n          According to Wright, Miller & Cooper:\n\n     The basic arguments against nonmutual preclusion may be\n     seen from two aspects . . . . [T]he nonparty who seeks to\n     invoke nonmutual preclusion has never had to bear the\n     burdens of litigating the issues, and accordingly\n     presents a much weaker claim than a party who has borne\n     these burdens or a privy who has at least run the risk of\n     defeat . . . . [T]he [second] argument is simply that the\n     risk of proliferating the consequences of a mistaken\n     judgment cannot be justified absent the full range of\n     needs that require preclusion between parties and those\n     in privity with them.\n\n18A Federal Practice & Procedure ยง 4464 (2d ed. 2002).\n\n                                  -50-\n\fthe   application    of   non-mutual   defensive    collateral   estoppel.\n\nCollateral estoppel is โdefensiveโ when wielded by a defendant to\n\nbar plaintiffs from relitigating an issue(s) previously decided in\n\nhis favor in a suit involving other plaintiffs.          For the reasons\n\narticulated    by   Justice   White,   permitting   litigants    to   assert\n\ncollateral estoppel in a defensive pose promotes efficiency by\n\ndiscouraging speculative lawsuits and conserving the resources of\n\ndefendants.\n\n           Non-mutual collateral estoppel may be asserted offensively\n\nas well.   That is, where, as here, plaintiffs seek to use issue\n\npreclusion to tie the defendants' hands with an adversely decided\n\nissue from a previous case, the use of collateral estoppel is deemed\n\nโoffensive.โ   As the Supreme Court recognized, the offensive use of\n\nnon-mutual collateral raises special concerns:\n\n           First, offensive use of collateral estoppel\n           does not promote judicial economy in the same\n           manner as defensive use does. Defensive use of\n           collateral estoppel precludes a plaintiff from\n           relitigating   identical   issues   by   merely\n           \"switching adversaries.\"       Thus defensive\n           collateral estoppel gives a plaintiff a strong\n           incentive to join all potential defendants in\n           the first action if possible. Offensive use of\n           collateral estoppel, on the other hand, creates\n           precisely the opposite incentive. Since a\n           plaintiff will be able to rely on a previous\n           judgment against a defendant but will not be\n           bound by that judgment if the defendant wins,\n           the plaintiff has every incentive to adopt a\n           \"wait and see\" attitude, in the hope that the\n           first action by another plaintiff will result\n           in a favorable judgment. Thus offensive use of\n           collateral estoppel will likely increase rather\n           than decrease the total amount of litigation,\n\n\n                                   -51-\n\f          since potential plaintiffs will have everything\n          to gain and nothing to lose by not intervening\n          in the first action.\n               A second argument against offensive use of\n          collateral estoppel is that it may be unfair to\n          a defendant. If a defendant in the first action\n          is sued for small or nominal damages, he may\n          have little incentive to defend vigorously,\n          particularly   if    future   suits   are   not\n          foreseeable.    Allowing offensive collateral\n          estoppel may also be unfair to a defendant if\n          the judgment relied upon as a basis for the\n          estoppel is itself inconsistent with one or\n          more previous judgments in favor of the\n          defendant.   Still another situation where it\n          might be unfair to apply offensive estoppel is\n          where the second action affords the defendant\n          procedural opportunities unavailable in the\n          first action that could readily cause a\n          different result.\n\nParklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322, 329-31 (1979) (internal\n\ncitations and footnotes omitted).   Notwithstanding these concerns,\n\nthe Supreme Court completed its break with traditional collateral\n\nestoppel doctrine in Parklane Hosiery by according district courts\n\nbroad discretion to apply non-mutual offensive collateral estoppel:\n\n          We have concluded that the preferable approach\n          for dealing with these problems in the federal\n          courts is not to preclude the use of offensive\n          collateral estoppel, but to grant trial courts\n          broad discretion to determine when it should be\n          applied. The general rule should be that in\n          cases where a plaintiff could easily have\n          joined in the earlier action or where, either\n          for the reasons discussed above or for other\n          reasons, the application of offensive estoppel\n          would be unfair to a defendant, a trial judge\n          should not allow the use of offensive\n          collateral estoppel.\n\nId. at 331.\n\n\n\n\n                               -52-\n\f            Significantly, the Supreme Court's apprehensive regard for\n\nnon-mutual offensive collateral estoppel is rooted in considerations\n\nthat are inapposite in a unique case such as this where a court\n\napplies collateral estoppel to pieces of a severed action over which\n\nit is presiding.     In the case at bar, the district court exercised\n\nits discretion under Rule 21 to mandate the severance of plaintiffs\n\ninto four trial groups, thereby prohibiting the sixty-two plaintiffs\n\nin groups 2, 3 and 4 from voluntarily joining the first litigation.\n\nOnce the action was severed, the prospect of multiple trials was\n\neminently foreseeable to the defendants, if not explicitly assured.\n\nMoreover, with one eye on the impending three trials, and the other\n\non their potentially immense exposure to the first group of twenty\n\nplaintiffs, see supra, the defendants had every possible incentive\n\nto vigorously litigate the issue of liability in the first action.\n\nSee id. The contentious proceedings below, coupled with the copious\n\nmaterials    filed   by   appellants   in   this   appeal,   confirm   that\n\ndefendants zealously contested (and continue to contest) the issue\n\nof liability to the first plaintiff group.          Finally, because the\n\ncourt severed the proceedings on the eve of trial, defendants have\n\nfully availed themselves of discovery and other pre-trial procedures\n\nwith respect to all eighty-two plaintiffs.         Accordingly, there is\n\nlittle risk that the subsequent proceedings will \"afford[] the\n\ndefendant[s] procedural opportunities unavailable in the first\n\naction that could readily cause a different result.\"             Id.   The\n\n\n\n                                  -53-\n\fdistrict court's stated intent to preside over all four trials\n\nfurther suggests that trial and post-trial procedures for the\n\nremaining sixty-two plaintiffs will not vary substantially from the\n\nprocedural opportunities available in the first trial.\n\n           Having addressed the background concerns raised by the\n\napplication of non-mutual offensive collateral estoppel, we turn our\n\nattention to the most important question -- whether defendants\n\n\"received a full and fair opportunity to litigate their claims\" in\n\nthe first trial.   Parkland Hosiery, 439 U.S. at 332.     Our prior\n\njurisprudence enumerates four factors that we consider in this\n\nregard:\n\n     (1)   an identity of issues (that is, that the issue sought to\n           be precluded is the same as that which was involved in\n           the prior proceeding),\n\n     (2)   actuality of litigation (that is, that the point was\n           actually litigated in the earlier proceeding),\n\n     (3)   finality of the earlier resolution (that is, that the\n           issue was determined by a valid and binding final\n           judgment or order), and\n\n     (4)  the centrality of the adjudication (that is, that the\n          determination of the issue in the prior proceeding was\n          essential to the final judgment or order).\nFaigin v. Kelly, 184 F.3d 67, 78 (1st Cir. 1999); see Grella v.\n\nSalem Five Cent Sav. Bank, 42 F.3d 26, 30 (1st Cir. 1994); NLRB v.\n\nDonna-Lee Sportswear Co., 836 F.2d 31, 34 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\n           Our focus here is confined to factor (2) -- actuality of\n\nlitigation.   To satisfy this factor, the party seeking to impose\n\nissue preclusion must demonstrate that the issue to be given\n\n\n\n                               -54-\n\fpreclusive effect was actually litigated in the prior proceeding.13\n\nWithout excluding the possibility of other problems with the scope\n\nof the court's collateral estoppel order,         we   cite by way of\n\nillustration the political discrimination claims of plaintiffs.\n\nThose First Amendment claims implicate the burden-shifting framework\n\nset forth in Mt. Healthy City School Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle,\n\n429 U.S. 274, 287 (1977).     To satisfy the first prong of the Mt.\n\nHealthy framework, plaintiffs must demonstrate that they engaged in\n\nconstitutionally protected activities, and that this protected\n\nconduct was a substantial or motivating factor in an employer's\n\nadverse employment action.    If plaintiffs satisfy the first prong,\n\nthe second prong of Mt. Healthy shifts the burden to defendant to\n\nprove \"by a preponderance of the evidence\" that the plaintiff would\n\nhave been subject to the adverse employment act even if he had not\n\nengaged in the protected conduct.       Id. at 278; Lewis, 321 F.3d at\n\n219.\n\n       13\n      We reproduce the three issues once more for the reader's\nbenefit:\n\n       (1)   That political affiliation was a substantial or\n             motivating factor in the implementation of the lay-off\n             plan.\n\n       (2)   That Defendants violated Plaintiffsโ due process rights\n             by implementing the lay-off plan in a discriminatory\n             fashion.\n\n       (3)   That Plaintiffs were discharged from their career\n             positions with the Municipality of Adjuntas on account of\n             their political affiliation; and other individuals were\n             employed to perform their duties under different titles,\n             and other different programs, in violation of the law.\n\n                                 -55-\n\f           The record indicates that eighty-two plaintiffs brought\n\nclaims against the defendants, but the municipality only made\n\nseventy-seven new hires over the relevant period.      Accordingly, it\n\nstands to reason that not every plaintiff was substituted for on a\n\none-to-one basis.       More fundamentally, application of the Mt.\n\nHealthy defense necessarily varies with the circumstances of the\n\nindividual plaintiffs.      Certain plaintiffs may have held municipal\n\npositions that were so superfluous or duplicative of the duties\n\nassigned to other employees that defendants could reasonably argue\n\nthat these plaintiffs would have been terminated regardless of their\n\npolitical affiliation.      Put differently, the defendants might be\n\nable to establish that the position of certain municipal employees\n\nwere sufficiently precarious that they would have been eliminated\n\nunder a properly motivated or improperly motivated implementation\n\nof the plan.       This contention has never actually been litigated\n\nbecause it is necessarily unique to the circumstances of the\n\nparticular plaintiffs involved in Trial 2.       Yet the second clause\n\nof   the   third    issue   designates   for   preclusive   effect   the\n\n\"established\" fact that \"other individuals were employed to perform\n\ntheir duties under different title, and other different programs,\n\nin violation of the law.\"      In our view, this ruling runs afoul of\n\nthe actual litigation requirement.\n\n           Our ruling is not intended to suggest that any flaws in\n\nthe collateral estoppel order are limited to the second clause of\n\n\n\n                                  -56-\n\fthe third issue. Having identified this problem, however, we cannot\n\ngo on to approve even in part a collateral estoppel order that\n\npurports to preclude any liability defense in Trial 2.             Where even\n\none issue of liability must be made available to defendants in the\n\nsecond trial, granting preclusive effect to the other issues may not\n\nresult in efficiency gains because litigation of the \"live\" issue\n\nmay require introduction of some of the same evidence pertinent to\n\nthe estopped issues. See 18A Wright, Miller & Cooper ยง 4465.3 (\"The\n\nneed to relitigate individual issues that overlap the common issues\n\nmay provide a special reason to deny preclusion -- little if any\n\ntrial time will be spared . . .\").\n\n          Still,   for   the    reasons    enumerated   in   the   preceding\n\nbackground discussion, we acknowledge that non-mutual offensive\n\ncollateral estoppel may well be a useful and appropriate trial\n\nmanagement device in the second trial.        Our ruling is not intended\n\nto discourage its application.      However, any renewed consideration\n\nof that doctrine by the trial court must be grounded in the\n\nproceedings of Trial 2.        Specifically, the judge and the parties\n\nshould revisit the course of proceedings in Trial 1, and the issues\n\nand proposed proof in Trial 2.            The defendants and the second\n\nplaintiff group should then have an opportunity to brief and argue\n\nthe question of how the doctrine of non-mutual offensive collateral\n\nestoppel should be fairly applied in light of those considerations.\n\nAt this juncture, and at this remove from an impending second trial,\n\n\n\n                                   -57-\n\fwe cannot determine with the necessary certitude that defendants\n\nhave had a full and fair opportunity to litigate all the relevant\n\ndimensions of their liability defense.   Accordingly, we must vacate\n\nthe court's collateral estoppel order.\n\n                                IV.\n\n          The unique circumstances of this case presented       the\n\ndistrict court with a number of complex questions in areas that have\n\npreviously received little attention in this circuit.     The court\n\ncorrectly resolved most of these issues in comprehensive written\n\ndecisions that greatly aided our review on appeal.   The court also\n\nacquitted itself admirably in managing this difficult litigation.\n\nThe errors we have cited in no way detract from our admiration for\n\nand appreciation of the court's work.\n\n          We vacate the district court's collateral estoppel order.\n\nIn all other respects we affirm.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -58-\n\f",

Stipulated and Undisputed Facts\n\n             Defendant Vera, representing the Popular Democratic Party\n\n(\"PDP\"), won the November 1996 mayoral election in Adjuntas, and\n\nappointed Defendant Gonzalez, a fellow PDP member, to be the\n\nDirector of Human Resources on January 14, 1997. Vera and Gonzalez\n\ninherited a municipal government whose ranks were swelled by 115\n\nnew hires during the seven-year administration of Rigoberto Ramos,\n\nVera's predecessor, and a member of the rival New Progressive Party\n\n(\"NPP\").     Of those 115 employees, only 2 were affiliated with the\n\nPDP.       By January 1997, the municipality employed 229 regular\n\nemployees, and the parties stipulated prior to trial that \"many\n\ndepartments were so overstaffed that some employees did not have\n\ndesks.\"\n\n             On April 30, 1996, the Puerto Rico Comptroller's Office\n\npublished an audit report, M-96-14, indicating that Adjuntas had\n\naccrued annual budget deficits of at least $1,000,000 from 1985 to\n\n1990.      After Vera took office in January 1997, he commissioned a\n\nsecond financial audit of the municipality by Reinaldo Ramirez, a\n\ncertified public accountant.     Ramirez presented his report on May\n\n\n\n       3\n      The facts presented here are intended to convey a general\nimpression of the case. We provide additional facts in subsequent\nsections of the discussion where they are pertinent to the legal\nanalysis.\n\n                                  -6-\n\f8, 1997, informing city officials that the municipality had a\n\nbudget deficit of over $5,000,000 and long term debts totaling more\n\nthan $2,000,000.         Anticipating this unwelcome news, Vera had\n\npreviously hired a Human Resources Consulting firm in February 1997\n\nto prepare a \"Layoff Plan for Municipality of Adjuntas Employees\"\n\n(the \"Plan\").        The consultants completed the Plan in March 1997,\n\nand it received approval from the Adjuntas Municipal Assembly on\n\nApril    2,   1997    (as   required     under    Puerto    Rico's     Autonomous\n\nMunicipalities Act).         See 21 P.R. Laws Ann. ยง 4551, as amended\n\n(1995) (\"Law 81\").          On April 11, 1997, a copy of the Plan was\n\ncirculated to every municipal employee.\n\n              In broad strokes, the Plan (1) enumerated the steps the\n\nmunicipality was obliged to undertake before firing employees\n\n(including      relocation,      retraining,       temporary     unpaid    leave,\n\ndemotions to vacant positions, and voluntary retirement); (2)\n\nestablished an order of priority for laying off municipal workers;\n\nand     (3)   established    a   series      of   procedures     for   earmarking\n\nparticular employees and job classifications for termination, and\n\nfor providing notice to the affected individuals. The Plan was not\n\nself-executing.         Instead,    it    authorized       the   termination   of\n\nmunicipal employees \"[w]hen the Mayor determines that there are\n\nfinancial problems and that as a result, programs or services are\n\nbeing affected.\"        The Mayor made this determination in May 1997\n\nafter conferring with Ramirez and the Human Resource consultants,\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fand he ordered city officials to implement the Plan.           When the dust\n\nsettled on October 31, 1997, 102 employees, including 82 NPP\n\nmembers and 11 PDP members, had been fired from their career\n\npositions.\n\n           Since   January   1,   1997,    the     municipality   has   hired\n\nseventy-seven new employees to \"contract\" or fixed-term jobs funded\n\nthrough non-municipal sources (i.e. federal and state programs).\n\nThe most significant of these programs, referred to as \"Law 52,\"\n\nallows municipalities to present job training proposals to the\n\nLabor Department of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, which may then\n\nappropriate funds on an annual basis to underwrite the salaries of\n\na certain number of municipal employees that the city could not\n\notherwise afford.    Only five of the eighty-two plaintiffs received\n\none of these seventy-seven appointments, the vast majority of which\n\nwent to PDP members.\n\nB.   Contested Facts\n\n             The trial featured a contentious dispute regarding the\n\nperiod preceding     the   October   31,   1997,    layoffs.      The   twenty\n\nplaintiffs in the first trial group testified that, during this\n\nperiod,   the   defendants   sabotaged     their    working    conditions   by\n\ndenying NPP employees (and only NPP employees) basic amenities,\n\nincluding phone privileges, short work breaks for breakfast, access\n\nto restroom facilities, and the opportunity to drive municipal\n\nvehicles to perform their job functions. Many plaintiffs testified\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fthat they were removed from their jobs entirely, and sent to random\n\nlocations where they were either given nothing to do for months on\n\nend or else ordered to perform menial tasks outside the scope of\n\ntheir job descriptions.    The defendants denied these allegations,\n\ncontending that prior abuses of telephone privileges and municipal\n\nvehicles had contributed to large budget overruns that compelled\n\nthe municipality to restrict access to these services.             According\n\nto defendants, the dearth of functioning bathroom facilities was a\n\nconsequence of plumbing and physical infrastructure deficiencies\n\nthat were ignored during the previous NPP mayoral administrations.\n\n            There was also a factual controversy concerning the\n\nimplementation of the Plan.         The defendants insisted that the\n\nparticular layoff scheme developed in accordance with the Plan was\n\npolitically neutral in both its conception and implementation.\n\nNoting that prior NPP administrations had almost exclusively hired\n\nNPP members to fill over a hundred municipal positions in the\n\npreceding years, they claimed it was inevitable that a seniority-\n\nbased layoff plan would disproportionately impact NPP employees.\n\n            Plaintiffs presented evidence of a different agenda.          In\n\ntheir   view,   Mayor    Vera    manipulated     the   Plan   to     produce\n\ndiscriminatory results in three ways.            First, he contravened\n\nprovisions of the Plan by failing to seriously consider measures\n\nshort of outright termination, including relocation, retraining,\n\ntemporary    unpaid   leave,    demotions   to   vacant   positions,     and\n\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fvoluntary          retirement.4     Second,    the    layoff    scheme   developed\n\npursuant to the Plan tied termination to seniority within job\n\nclassifications,           rather   than      seniority     across     the   board.\n\nHypothetically, under this scheme, an NPP librarian with seven\n\nyears of seniority could be laid off while a PDP office clerk with\n\nfive years of seniority retained her position.                  Vera's scheme thus\n\neschewed the possibility of retraining veteran NPP employees to\n\ntake over the jobs of less senior PDP members with jobs requiring\n\na similar skill set (but bearing a different classification),\n\nthereby exacerbating the discriminatory impact of the layoffs.\n\nThird, the seniority system employed by defendants incorporated a\n\nfixed years-of-service threshold -- eight years and ten months --\n\nthat       dated    back   precisely   to     the    end   of   the   previous   PDP\n\nadministration in Adjuntas.            In other words, any employee with\n\neight years and ten months of seniority (or more) was immune from\n\nthe layoffs.          Accordingly, PDP members hired during that previous\n\nadministration were insulated from the layoffs, while all employees\n\n\n       4\n           Article X of the Lay Off Plan provides:\n\n       If the layoff is due to lack of funds, it must be\n       evaluated if it is possible to generate savings through\n       means other than requiring the elimination of permanent\n       positions.   If the crisis is temporary, to consider\n       reducing the work day and granting unpaid leaves. To\n       consider, additionally, if it is feasible to retrain\n       employees in other functions or relocate them to other\n       positions within or outside the Municipality.\n\nArticle X, Layoff Plan for Municipality of Adjuntas Employees\n(March 1997).\n\n                                        -10-\n\fhired thereafter (during the intervening NPP administrations) were\n\nat risk of termination.\n\n             Finally, there was evidence that Vera contrived to shed\n\nNPP employees with sufficient seniority to withstand the initial\n\nround   of   layoffs   by   simply    eliminating   their   job   category\n\naltogether. For example, if an NPP member employed as a \"Citizens'\n\nAffairs Specialist\" outranked his PDP colleagues on the seniority\n\nscale, the municipality would eliminate the Citizens' Affairs\n\nSpecialist position entirely, and then hire back the former PDP\n\nCitizens' Affairs Specialists under the auspices of Law 52 or some\n\nother employment program funded by outside sources.\n\n                                     III.\n\n             As a preliminary matter, we note that our review of the\n\nlegal issues in this case is handicapped considerably by the\n\ndefendants' failure to produce transcripts of the second half of\n\nthe trial.     The defense began presenting its case on October 29,\n\nand the court issued its instructions to the jury on November 19.\n\nThe only record of the defendants' case in chief before us is a\n\nsmall excerpt of Mayor Vera's direct testimony on October 30, and\n\nan excerpt of CPA Ramirez's direct testimony on November 6.            The\n\ninformative value of even these tidbits is reduced substantially by\n\nthe defendants' failure to provide a transcript of the cross-\n\nexamination of these witnesses by plaintiffs' counsel.\n\n             Rule 10 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure\n\nclearly states that \"[i]f the appellant intends to urge on appeal\n\n                                     -11-\n\fthat a finding or conclusion is unsupported by the evidence or is\n\ncontrary to the evidence, the appellant must include in the record\n\na   transcript     of   all    evidence   relevant      to    that   finding   or\n\nconclusion.\"       Fed. R. App. P. 10(b)(2).             Elaborating on this\n\nrequirement, we have admonished appellants \"with a regulatory\n\nbordering on the monotonous\" that\n\n            [t]his rule imposes a duty upon an appellant\n            to print all of the evidence, good and bad,\n            material to the point he wishes to raise.\n            Should an appellant spurn this duty and drape\n            an incomplete record around the court's neck,\n            the court in its discretion either may\n            scrutinize the merits of the case insofar as\n            the record permits, or may dismiss the appeal\n            if absence of a full transcript thwarts\n            intelligent review.    In this vein, we have\n            held . . . that, should the record provided on\n            appeal preclude us from reaching a reasoned\n            determination on the merits, it is the\n            appellant who must bear the brunt of an\n            insufficient record on appeal.\n\nMoore v.

The court compounded its error, in\n\ndefendants' view, by postponing a final ruling on plaintiffs'\n\npolitical    discrimination     claims    pending    the   submission     of\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\fadditional evidence from plaintiffs to demonstrate that they were\n\nqualified to fill the seventy-seven new positions created by the\n\nmunicipality after January 1, 1997.             Defendants argue that the\n\ncourt was obliged to rule in their favor on the basis of the\n\ninsufficient evidence currently before it.\n\n              These objections are unavailing. When a district court's\n\nassessment of the evidentiary record at the summary judgment stage\n\nis subsequently \"overtaken\" by a full trial and verdict, it is our\n\npractice not to revisit that determination on appeal:\n\n              We need not address the merits of [a]\n              preverdict challenge to the sufficiency of the\n              evidence on the motion for summary judgment.\n              Such an attack on the denial of defendant's\n              motion   for  summary   judgment   \"has   been\n              overtaken by subsequent events, namely, a\n              full-dress trial and an adverse jury verdict\"\n              . . . The rationale for this rule has been\n              based on the procedural fact that denial of a\n              motion for summary judgment \"is merely a\n              judge's determination that genuine issues of\n              material fact exist.   It is not a judgment,\n              and does not foreclose trial on issues on\n              which summary judgment was sought.\" Hence, a\n              challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence\n              adduced on the motion to support the district\n              court's conclusion that genuine issues of\n              material fact exist will not lie on appeal.\n\nEastern Mountain Platform Tennis, Inc. v.

Severance\n\n            On October 11, 1997, the district court severed the case\n\ninto four separate trials, finding that\n\n            it is not practical or just to subject one\n            jury panel to a trial in which 82 plaintiffs\n            with varying claims will be testifying.   No\n            single jury panel would be able to remember\n            all of the testimony and evidence or be able\n            to reach a fair and impartial verdict at the\n            end of that time. It is the opinion of this\n            Court that severance will most likely result\n            in   a  just   final  disposition   of  this\n            litigation.\n\nThe defendants objected on numerous grounds, arguing inter alia\n\nthat the court's proposal (1) precluded defendants from eliciting\n\ncontradictory testimony among plaintiffs, (2) imposed increased\n\nexpense     and   inconvenience     on    defendants   by     compelling      the\n\nexamination of expert witnesses and government officials on four\n\noccasions    rather   than   one,   (3)   reduced   the     likelihood   of    an\n\nimpartial jury for the second, third and fourth plaintiff groups,\n\nand (4) hampered defendants' ability to portray the relevant events\n\nto the jury in a comprehensive fashion.          On October 15, the court\n\nemphatically rejected these concerns in a written ruling:\n\n            The considerations alleged by Defendants as to\n            the fact that they would have to present\n            evidence at four different occasions is of\n            secondary    importance.       \"A    paramount\n            consideration    at   all    times    in   the\n            administration of justice is a fair and\n            impartial     trial    to    all    litigants.\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\f           Considerations of economy of time, money and\n           convenience of witnesses must yield thereto.\"\n\nAcevedo-Garcia v.

Thus, the court's references to\n\nRule 42(b) notwithstanding, its clearly articulated intent was to\n\nsever the plaintiffs pursuant to Rule 21.

The   court   once   again       rejected\n\ndefendants' claim, concluding that the jury's findings foreclosed\n\nthe availability of immunity:\n\n             For the record, the prohibition against\n             political    discrimination     was    clearly\n             established in 1997 when Defendants acted to\n             violate Plaintiffs' constitutionally protected\n             rights.    A jury trial was held wherein\n             Plaintiffs presented evidence that supported\n             their allegations of political discrimination.\n             The evidence led the Jury to conclude that\n             political   affiliation    was   in   fact   a\n             substantial or motivating factor for Mayor\n             Vera Monroig's and Irma Gonzalez's actions . .\n             . .

Proposed Jury Instruction 51: Qualified Immunity\n\n          Government officials performing discretionary functions\n          are granted qualified immunity from civil claims for\n          damages, if their conduct at the time of the alleged acts\n          that give rise to the civil damages \"does not violate\n          clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of\n          which a reasonable person would have known.\"          The\n          relevant inquiry \"is the objective question whether a\n          reasonable officer could have believed the actions\n          alleged by the plaintiff herein\" to be lawful, in light\n          of clearly established law and the information the state\n          official possessed.\n\n2.        Proposed   Jury   Instruction   53:      Reach of Qualified\n          Immunity\n\n          Even defendants who violate constitutional rights enjoy\n          a qualified immunity that protects them from liability\n          for damages unless it is further demonstrated that their\n          conduct was unreasonable with respect to clearly\n          established rights and laws at the time of the conduct at\n          issue.\n\nAfter proposing these instructions, defendants concede that they\n\nfailed to object on the record to the court's refusal to issue the\n\ninstructions before the jury retired to deliberate.

Simply put, the verdict was not\n          against    the   weight   of   the   evidence.\n          Considering the significant disruptions which\n          Defendants' actions caused the Plaintiffs'\n          lifestyles, the Court does not find that the\n          compensatory and punitive damages award for\n          each individual Plaintiff . . . is grossly\n          excessive or inordinate.       Further, after\n          weighing the evidence, the Court finds that\n          the damage award also does not shock the\n          conscience.\n\nAcevedo-Garcia, 213 F. Supp. 2d at 53.         On appeal, defendants\n\nreiterate their objections to the jury verdict as excessive.      They\n\nalso raise a new argument that was not submitted to the district\n\ncourt -- namely, that the jury's award of compensatory damages for\n\ndue   process   violations   was     duplicative   of   the   political\n\ndiscrimination damages also awarded as part of the verdict.\n\n                                   -34-\n\f          a.    Duplicate damages\n\n          This argument, which is premised on an error of law, has\n\nmore force than defendants' factually grounded claim of excessive\n\ndamages. Before addressing the consequences of defendants' failure\n\nto preserve this argument below, we examine the merits of the claim\n\nitself.\n\n          By way of background, the jury award was broken down into\n\nfive components for the eight plaintiffs alleging discrimination,\n\ndue process violations and harassment:\n\n          (1)     Due process violations;\n          (2)     Political   discrimination   in  the  form   of\n                  harassment;\n          (3)     Political discrimination resulting in dismissal\n                  causing pain and suffering;\n          (4)     Political discrimination resulting in dismissal\n                  causing loss of earnings; and\n          (5)     Punitive damages\n\nFor the twelve plaintiffs alleging only political discrimination\n\nand due process injuries, the jury award contained all of the above\n\ncomponents except (2).7\n\n\n     7\n      The individual damage awards for each plaintiff are too\nlengthy to list here.      As a general matter, there was some\nuniformity among the damage awards. For category (1), all twenty\nplaintiffs received $75,000 in compensatory damages from Defendant\nVera and $75,000 from Defendant Gonzalez. Every plaintiff also\nreceived $15,000 in punitive damages from Defendant Vera and\n$15,000 in punitive damages from Defendant Monroig.\n     Categories (2), (3), and (4) produced some variation. For the\neight plaintiffs alleging political harassment, the jury found that\nfour had failed to prove political harassment, and awarded no\ndamages in this category. Two plaintiffs received $50,000, and the\nother two received $75,000.     Finally, the awards for pain and\nsuffering ranged from $75,000 to $150,000, and the awards for lost\nearnings ran the gamut from zero damages awarded to $55,000 (all\nawards in this category reflected varying percentage reductions for\n\n                                -35-\n\f            Defendants     point     out     that    plaintiffs'     Fourteenth\n\nAmendment due process claims arise from the municipality's failure\n\nto offer the claimants alternatives to outright termination.                   The\n\nconsequences of this denial of due process include the normal\n\ninjuries    associated     with    removal    from   a   secure    job    --   lost\n\nearnings, pain and suffering associated with unemployment, lost\n\nfuture   income,    etc.     Defendants       contend    that     their   alleged\n\nviolation    of   defendants'      First     Amendment   rights     resulted    in\n\nprecisely the same harms. Because the jury essentially compensated\n\nplaintiffs for their unemployment injuries twice -- once under a\n\nFirst Amendment theory and once under a Fourteenth Amendment theory\n\n-- defendants argue that the court erred as a matter of law in\n\nentering judgment on a \"double award\" for the same injury.\n\n            It is well-settled that double awards for the same injury\n\nare impermissible.

Yet there is no analogous reference to front pay in either\n\nthe jury instructions or the due process section of the verdict\n\nform, which simply provides that \"[u]nder the law you may choose to\n\naward damages for a violation of due process.

If the jury had found defendants guilty\n\nof either a due process violation or a First Amendment violation,\n\nbut not both, plaintiffs would still be entitled to front pay, back\n\npay, and pain and suffering, because the singular violation would\n\nstill have resulted in the loss of career employment and any\n\nsecondary harms flowing from that loss.      Put differently, nothing\n\ninherent in the nature of a due process violation limits the\n\nresulting economic injury to front pay, and nothing inherent in an\n\nact of political discrimination inflicts an injury that is limited\n\nto back pay.\n\n          Finally, we note that the court's duplicative damage\n\ninstruction was worded so as to suggest that the relevant \"injury\"\n\nthat could not be doubly compensated was the violation of a\n\nconstitutional right, rather than an actual loss or harm.\n\n          In awarding damages you should be careful not\n          to award duplicate damages. Plaintiffs are\n          entitled to collect full compensation for\n          their injuries if proved, but they must not\n          collect more than once for the same wrong . .\n          . . Again, each plaintiff is entitled to\n          collect full compensation for his or her\n          injury but the plaintiff must not collect more\n          than once for the same wrong.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -39-\n\f(emphasis added).       The court's use of the term \"wrong,\" read in\n\nconjunction with a special verdict form divided into separate\n\nsections for each constitutional violation, may have led the jury\n\nto     conceptualize    the   term   \"injury\"      as   the   violation     of     a\n\nconstitutional right vel non, rather than an actual loss caused by\n\nthe violation of that right.          See Stachura, 477 U.S. at 306-07;\n\nCarey, 435 U.S. at 254.       Possibly, in the absence of more detailed\n\ninstructions supporting plaintiffs' front pay/back pay theory, the\n\njury     may    have   erroneously    awarded      duplicative        damages     by\n\ncompensating plaintiffs for the same actual losses under both a due\n\nprocess and political discrimination theory of liability.                         We\n\nacknowledge, therefore, that the lack of clarity in the court's\n\nduplicative      damages   instruction      was   obvious     error    which     may\n\npotentially have resulted in an improper award of double damages.\n\n               We must now decide whether defendants are entitled to\n\nrelief in the face of this error.                 Defendants were on notice\n\nthroughout the proceedings that plaintiffs were seeking recovery for\n\nboth due process violations and political discrimination.                  To the\n\nextent that a jury award on both claims would be duplicative, the\n\nproper practice is to ensure that the verdict form is structured so\n\nas to allow the jury to recompense the plaintiffs' injuries just\n\nonce.

If the\n           parties explicitly agree that the damages\n           should be the same on each claim, then it is\n           easy    enough     to    construct    special\n           interrogatories that identify separate bases\n           for liability but have only a single line for\n           damages. On the other hand, when the amounts\n           awarded could conceivably differ depending on\n           the claim but may also involve some overlap,\n           verdict forms sometimes require a separate\n           specification of damages for each claim on\n           which the jury determines liability, leaving\n           it to the judge to make the appropriate\n           adjustments to avoid double recovery.\n\nId.

The     jury    returned    a   verdict    of\n\n$6,956,400, of which $6,356,400 (the total jury award, excluding\n\npunitive damages)9 was against a municipality whose entire annual\n\nbudget in 1996-97 was only $4,529,327.           See Exhibit 2, Defendants'\n\nStatement of Uncontested Facts (July 17, 1998).                   Moreover, this\n\nfigure    reflects    the   damages    owed    only    to   the    first    twenty\n\nplaintiffs;    sixty-two     plaintiffs      remain    in   the    queue.       But\n\n\"prejudice,\" as that term is incorporated into the plain error test,\n\n\n      9\n      In City of Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">247</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1981), the Supreme Court ruled that municipalities are immune from\npunitive damages under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.

At best, defendants can only demonstrate\n\nthe   possibility   that    faulty   jury    instructions      resulted   in   a\n\nduplicative damage award.\n\n            Indeed,   the   appellate    materials     set   forth   competing\n\nexplanations for the jury's award of damages under both a due\n\nprocess and First Amendment theory of liability.             Appellants argue\n\nthat the compensatory damages awarded under each theory doubly\n\nrecompensed claimants for their actual losses, while appellees\n\ninsist that the jury compensated plaintiffs for their total loss\n\njust once, but divided that single award between the due process and\n\nFirst Amendment causes of action.        Nothing in this record precludes\n\nthat possibility, or rules out other appropriate bases for the jury\n\naward.   For defendants who fail to protect themselves on the record\n\nby    requesting   jury   instructions      and/or   special   verdict    forms\n\nstructured to preclude the possibility of a double damage award,\n\nthese possibilities are fatal to a request for plain error relief.\n\nThe \"prejudice\" component of the plain error standard implies a\n\nstringent demonstration of causation.          Thus, in Chestnut v. City of\n\nLowell, our decision to vacate a punitive damage award on plain\n\nerror review rested in part on the finding that \"[p]rejudice in the\n\nsense of affecting the final outcome is . . . obvious:           had the jury\n\nbeen instructed as to the City's immunity [from punitive damages]\n\nthere almost certainly would not be a $500,000 judgment against it\n\n\n\n                                     -43-\n\ftoday, although conceivably the jury might have somewhat increased\n\nthe compensatory damages.\"              Chestnut, 305 F.3d at 20 (emphasis\n\nadded).      Here,       although      we   can    speculate   that    the    court's\n\ninstructions may have led the jury to erroneously award duplicative\n\ndamages,   we     have    no    concrete     basis   for   accepting    defendants'\n\ncharacterization of the jury award.                Under these circumstances, we\n\ndecline to expand the rule of Chestnut to encompass cases in which\n\nprejudice to the aggrieved party is not manifest on the face of the\n\nrecord.\n\n             b.    Excessive damages\n\n             Defendants meticulously document the economic damages\n\nawarded to each plaintiff, and argue mathematically that the totals\n\nin every case exceed the lost wages (reduced by the appropriate\n\npercentage for mitigation).             As a threshold matter, the magnitude\n\nof the claimed discrepancy is sufficiently small (ranging from\n\n$2,607.94 to $10,900.00) to preclude a finding that the verdict was\n\n\"grossly excessive, inordinate, shocking to the conscience of the\n\ncourt, or so high that it would be a denial of justice to permit it\n\nto stand.\"        Correa, 69 F.3d at 1197; Segal, 746 F.2d at 81.\n\nFurthermore,      the    jury    was    entitled     to   consider    any   secondary\n\neconomic injuries flowing from the plaintiffs' loss of earnings and\n\nemployment benefits. See Stachura, 477 U.S. at 307; Davet, 973 F.2d\n\nat 29.     For example, nearly every claimant testified that they\n\nrelied entirely on their monthly earnings to cover the expenses of\n\n\n\n                                            -44-\n\frunning their household, meet their mortgage obligations, pay their\n\nchildrens' tuition, etc.         As a consequence of losing their jobs,\n\nplaintiffs were forced to seek additional bank loans, dip into their\n\nsavings, and make other costly financial adjustments to cover these\n\nexpenses.\n\n            We also decline to set aside the damages awarded in the\n\nother three categories (pain and suffering resulting from political\n\nharassment,    pain    and   suffering    resulting   from   dismissal,    and\n\npunitive damages).

The individualized nature of the\n\ntwenty    verdicts    reflects   the   jury's   careful   attention   to   the\n\npeculiar circumstances of each plaintiff, and evinces the jury's\n\ndesire to craft an appropriate award for each claimant.10\n\n\n\n\n     10\n      Plaintiffs argue on appeal that \"[t]he due process award\neffectively was the monetary equivalent of reinstatement.

Non-Mutual Offensive Collateral Estoppel\n\n            On January 30, 2002, the district court issued an order\n\nprecluding the defendants from relitigating (with respect to the\n\nremaining sixty-two plaintiffs) the following three issues that were\n\ndeterminative of defendantsโ liability in the first trial:\n\n      (1)   That political affiliation was a substantial or\n            motivating factor in the implementation of the lay-off\n            plan.\n\n      (2)   That Defendants violated Plaintiffsโ due process rights\n            by implementing the lay-off plan in a discriminatory\n            fashion.\n\n      (3)   That Plaintiffs were discharged from their career\n            positions with the Municipality of Adjuntas on account of\n            their political affiliation; and other individuals were\n            employed to perform their duties under different titles,\n            and under different programs, in violation of the law.\n\nAcevedo-Garcia, 213 F. Supp. 2d at 40.         This ruling, if allowed to\n\nstand, would confine the scope of the subsequent three trials to the\n\nissue of damages.      Not surprisingly, defendants vigorously dispute\n\nthe courtโs application of collateral estoppel, raising a host of\n\nobjections that we consider in due course.\n\n            As   a    threshold   matter,   neither   party   disputes   our\n\njurisdiction     to   review   the   court's   application    of   collateral\n\nestoppel.    This case presents unique circumstances, however, that\n\ncall into question the ripeness of the collateral estoppel question.\n\nSee Pustell v. Lynn Pub.

Here, the district court announced its\n\nattention to apply collateral estoppel at the end of Trial 1, but\n\nthe court's ruling will have no preclusive effect until Trials 2,\n\n3, and 4, which are not currently before us.    Because these trials\n\nwere severed into four independent proceedings pursuant to Rule 21,\n\nsee supra, any resolution of the collateral estoppel question will\n\nhave no effect on the rights of the parties as they pertain to Trial\n\n1.

Instead, they are a judicial\n\nartifice imposed pursuant to the court's case management authority\n\nunder Rule 21 to streamline the proceedings in the subsequent three\n\ntrials.    That the court chose to issue its collateral estoppel\n\nruling at the at the end of Trial 1 rather than the beginning of\n\nTrial 2 in no way attenuates the finality of the order or the force\n\nof its preclusive effect.\n\n\n\n                                -47-\n\f          Moreover, neither party disputes that the district court\n\n-- the same court that is presiding over the subsequent trials --\n\nhas entered a final order decreeing that non-mutual offensive\n\ncollateral estoppel will be enforced in the subsequent three cases.\n\nThe contours of the order are clear from its language, and the\n\nattorneys who litigated the issue below and now on appeal are the\n\ncounsel of record for plaintiffs and defendants in all four matters.\n\nThe district court's order bound the defendants as of its entry of\n\nJanuary 30, and the application of collateral estoppel in the\n\nsubsequent   trials   is    a   certainty   beyond   any   speculation.\n\nAccordingly, there is no compelling reason for us to delay our\n\nreview of the collateral estoppel question until the judgment in\n\nTrial 2 is appealed.       If, as a consequence of sidestepping the\n\ncollateral estoppel issue now, we belatedly reversed the district\n\ncourt's estoppel ruling at that late stage, we would unnecessarily\n\nvoid a burdensome litigation that is currently slated to involve\n\ntwenty plaintiffs and forty-eight claims.

The excerpted language from Blonder-Tongue endorses\n\n     12\n          According to Wright, Miller & Cooper:\n\n     The basic arguments against nonmutual preclusion may be\n     seen from two aspects . . . . [T]he nonparty who seeks to\n     invoke nonmutual preclusion has never had to bear the\n     burdens of litigating the issues, and accordingly\n     presents a much weaker claim than a party who has borne\n     these burdens or a privy who has at least run the risk of\n     defeat . . . . [T]he [second] argument is simply that the\n     risk of proliferating the consequences of a mistaken\n     judgment cannot be justified absent the full range of\n     needs that require preclusion between parties and those\n     in privity with them.\n\n18A Federal Practice & Procedure ยง 4464 (2d ed. 2002).\n\n                                  -50-\n\fthe   application    of   non-mutual   defensive    collateral   estoppel.\n\nCollateral estoppel is โdefensiveโ when wielded by a defendant to\n\nbar plaintiffs from relitigating an issue(s) previously decided in\n\nhis favor in a suit involving other plaintiffs.          For the reasons\n\narticulated    by   Justice   White,   permitting   litigants    to   assert\n\ncollateral estoppel in a defensive pose promotes efficiency by\n\ndiscouraging speculative lawsuits and conserving the resources of\n\ndefendants.\n\n           Non-mutual collateral estoppel may be asserted offensively\n\nas well.   That is, where, as here, plaintiffs seek to use issue\n\npreclusion to tie the defendants' hands with an adversely decided\n\nissue from a previous case, the use of collateral estoppel is deemed\n\nโoffensive.โ   As the Supreme Court recognized, the offensive use of\n\nnon-mutual collateral raises special concerns:\n\n           First, offensive use of collateral estoppel\n           does not promote judicial economy in the same\n           manner as defensive use does. Defensive use of\n           collateral estoppel precludes a plaintiff from\n           relitigating   identical   issues   by   merely\n           \"switching adversaries.\"       Thus defensive\n           collateral estoppel gives a plaintiff a strong\n           incentive to join all potential defendants in\n           the first action if possible. Offensive use of\n           collateral estoppel, on the other hand, creates\n           precisely the opposite incentive. Since a\n           plaintiff will be able to rely on a previous\n           judgment against a defendant but will not be\n           bound by that judgment if the defendant wins,\n           the plaintiff has every incentive to adopt a\n           \"wait and see\" attitude, in the hope that the\n           first action by another plaintiff will result\n           in a favorable judgment. Thus offensive use of\n           collateral estoppel will likely increase rather\n           than decrease the total amount of litigation,\n\n\n                                   -51-\n\f          since potential plaintiffs will have everything\n          to gain and nothing to lose by not intervening\n          in the first action.\n               A second argument against offensive use of\n          collateral estoppel is that it may be unfair to\n          a defendant. If a defendant in the first action\n          is sued for small or nominal damages, he may\n          have little incentive to defend vigorously,\n          particularly   if    future   suits   are   not\n          foreseeable.    Allowing offensive collateral\n          estoppel may also be unfair to a defendant if\n          the judgment relied upon as a basis for the\n          estoppel is itself inconsistent with one or\n          more previous judgments in favor of the\n          defendant.   Still another situation where it\n          might be unfair to apply offensive estoppel is\n          where the second action affords the defendant\n          procedural opportunities unavailable in the\n          first action that could readily cause a\n          different result.\n\nParklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109964\"><a href=\"/opinion/109964/parklane-hosiery-co-v-shore/\"><span class=\"volume\">439</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">322</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 329-31 (1979) (internal\n\ncitations and footnotes omitted).   Notwithstanding these concerns,\n\nthe Supreme Court completed its break with traditional collateral\n\nestoppel doctrine in Parklane Hosiery by according district courts\n\nbroad discretion to apply non-mutual offensive collateral estoppel:\n\n          We have concluded that the preferable approach\n          for dealing with these problems in the federal\n          courts is not to preclude the use of offensive\n          collateral estoppel, but to grant trial courts\n          broad discretion to determine when it should be\n          applied. The general rule should be that in\n          cases where a plaintiff could easily have\n          joined in the earlier action or where, either\n          for the reasons discussed above or for other\n          reasons, the application of offensive estoppel\n          would be unfair to a defendant, a trial judge\n          should not allow the use of offensive\n          collateral estoppel.\n\nId. at 331.\n\n\n\n\n                               -52-\n\f            Significantly, the Supreme Court's apprehensive regard for\n\nnon-mutual offensive collateral estoppel is rooted in considerations\n\nthat are inapposite in a unique case such as this where a court\n\napplies collateral estoppel to pieces of a severed action over which\n\nit is presiding.     In the case at bar, the district court exercised\n\nits discretion under Rule 21 to mandate the severance of plaintiffs\n\ninto four trial groups, thereby prohibiting the sixty-two plaintiffs\n\nin groups 2, 3 and 4 from voluntarily joining the first litigation.\n\nOnce the action was severed, the prospect of multiple trials was\n\neminently foreseeable to the defendants, if not explicitly assured.\n\nMoreover, with one eye on the impending three trials, and the other\n\non their potentially immense exposure to the first group of twenty\n\nplaintiffs, see supra, the defendants had every possible incentive\n\nto vigorously litigate the issue of liability in the first action.\n\nSee id. The contentious proceedings below, coupled with the copious\n\nmaterials    filed   by   appellants   in   this   appeal,   confirm   that\n\ndefendants zealously contested (and continue to contest) the issue\n\nof liability to the first plaintiff group.          Finally, because the\n\ncourt severed the proceedings on the eve of trial, defendants have\n\nfully availed themselves of discovery and other pre-trial procedures\n\nwith respect to all eighty-two plaintiffs.         Accordingly, there is\n\nlittle risk that the subsequent proceedings will \"afford[] the\n\ndefendant[s] procedural opportunities unavailable in the first\n\naction that could readily cause a different result.\"             Id.   The\n\n\n\n                                  -53-\n\fdistrict court's stated intent to preside over all four trials\n\nfurther suggests that trial and post-trial procedures for the\n\nremaining sixty-two plaintiffs will not vary substantially from the\n\nprocedural opportunities available in the first trial.\n\n           Having addressed the background concerns raised by the\n\napplication of non-mutual offensive collateral estoppel, we turn our\n\nattention to the most important question -- whether defendants\n\n\"received a full and fair opportunity to litigate their claims\" in\n\nthe first trial.   Parkland Hosiery, 439 U.S. at 332.     Our prior\n\njurisprudence enumerates four factors that we consider in this\n\nregard:\n\n     (1)   an identity of issues (that is, that the issue sought to\n           be precluded is the same as that which was involved in\n           the prior proceeding),\n\n     (2)   actuality of litigation (that is, that the point was\n           actually litigated in the earlier proceeding),\n\n     (3)   finality of the earlier resolution (that is, that the\n           issue was determined by a valid and binding final\n           judgment or order), and\n\n     (4)  the centrality of the adjudication (that is, that the\n          determination of the issue in the prior proceeding was\n          essential to the final judgment or order).\nFaigin v.

To satisfy the first prong of the Mt.\n\nHealthy framework, plaintiffs must demonstrate that they engaged in\n\nconstitutionally protected activities, and that this protected\n\nconduct was a substantial or motivating factor in an employer's\n\nadverse employment action.    If plaintiffs satisfy the first prong,\n\nthe second prong of Mt. Healthy shifts the burden to defendant to\n\nprove \"by a preponderance of the evidence\" that the plaintiff would\n\nhave been subject to the adverse employment act even if he had not\n\nengaged in the protected conduct.       Id. at 278; Lewis, 321 F.3d at\n\n219.\n\n       13\n      We reproduce the three issues once more for the reader's\nbenefit:\n\n       (1)   That political affiliation was a substantial or\n             motivating factor in the implementation of the lay-off\n             plan.\n\n       (2)   That Defendants violated Plaintiffsโ due process rights\n             by implementing the lay-off plan in a discriminatory\n             fashion.\n\n       (3)   That Plaintiffs were discharged from their career\n             positions with the Municipality of Adjuntas on account of\n             their political affiliation; and other individuals were\n             employed to perform their duties under different titles,\n             and other different programs, in violation of the law.\n\n                                 -55-\n\f           The record indicates that eighty-two plaintiffs brought\n\nclaims against the defendants, but the municipality only made\n\nseventy-seven new hires over the relevant period.      Accordingly, it\n\nstands to reason that not every plaintiff was substituted for on a\n\none-to-one basis.       More fundamentally, application of the Mt.\n\nHealthy defense necessarily varies with the circumstances of the\n\nindividual plaintiffs.      Certain plaintiffs may have held municipal\n\npositions that were so superfluous or duplicative of the duties\n\nassigned to other employees that defendants could reasonably argue\n\nthat these plaintiffs would have been terminated regardless of their\n\npolitical affiliation.      Put differently, the defendants might be\n\nable to establish that the position of certain municipal employees\n\nwere sufficiently precarious that they would have been eliminated\n\nunder a properly motivated or improperly motivated implementation\n\nof the plan.       This contention has never actually been litigated\n\nbecause it is necessarily unique to the circumstances of the\n\nparticular plaintiffs involved in Trial 2.       Yet the second clause\n\nof   the   third    issue   designates   for   preclusive   effect   the\n\n\"established\" fact that \"other individuals were employed to perform\n\ntheir duties under different title, and other different programs,\n\nin violation of the law.\"      In our view, this ruling runs afoul of\n\nthe actual litigation requirement.\n\n           Our ruling is not intended to suggest that any flaws in\n\nthe collateral estoppel order are limited to the second clause of\n\n\n\n                                  -56-\n\fthe third issue. Having identified this problem, however, we cannot\n\ngo on to approve even in part a collateral estoppel order that\n\npurports to preclude any liability defense in Trial 2.             Where even\n\none issue of liability must be made available to defendants in the\n\nsecond trial, granting preclusive effect to the other issues may not\n\nresult in efficiency gains because litigation of the \"live\" issue\n\nmay require introduction of some of the same evidence pertinent to\n\nthe estopped issues. See 18A Wright, Miller & Cooper ยง 4465.3 (\"The\n\nneed to relitigate individual issues that overlap the common issues\n\nmay provide a special reason to deny preclusion -- little if any\n\ntrial time will be spared . . .\").\n\n          Still,   for   the    reasons    enumerated   in   the   preceding\n\nbackground discussion, we acknowledge that non-mutual offensive\n\ncollateral estoppel may well be a useful and appropriate trial\n\nmanagement device in the second trial.        Our ruling is not intended\n\nto discourage its application.      However, any renewed consideration\n\nof that doctrine by the trial court must be grounded in the\n\nproceedings of Trial 2.        Specifically, the judge and the parties\n\nshould revisit the course of proceedings in Trial 1, and the issues\n\nand proposed proof in Trial 2.            The defendants and the second\n\nplaintiff group should then have an opportunity to brief and argue\n\nthe question of how the doctrine of non-mutual offensive collateral\n\nestoppel should be fairly applied in light of those considerations.\n\nAt this juncture, and at this remove from an impending second trial,\n\n\n\n                                   -57-\n\fwe cannot determine with the necessary certitude that defendants\n\nhave had a full and fair opportunity to litigate all the relevant\n\ndimensions of their liability defense.   Accordingly, we must vacate\n\nthe court's collateral estoppel order.\n\n                                IV.\n\n          The unique circumstances of this case presented       the\n\ndistrict court with a number of complex questions in areas that have\n\npreviously received little attention in this circuit.     The court\n\ncorrectly resolved most of these issues in comprehensive written\n\ndecisions that greatly aided our review on appeal.   The court also\n\nacquitted itself admirably in managing this difficult litigation.\n\nThe errors we have cited in no way detract from our admiration for\n\nand appreciation of the court's work.\n\n          We vacate the district court's collateral estoppel order.\n\nIn all other respects we affirm.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -58-\n\f</pre>",
