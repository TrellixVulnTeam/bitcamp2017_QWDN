José Antonio Fusté,    U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                Selya and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Héctor Rodríguez-Peña on brief pro se.\n     Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant U.S. Attorney, Jacqueline D.\nNovas, Assistant U.S. Attorney, and Rosa Emilia Rodríguez-Velez,\nUnited States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n                        December 11, 2006\n\f             Per Curiam. Defendant Héctor Rodríguez-Peña, having been\n\nconvicted of multiple criminal offenses back in 1993, appeals from\n\nthe denial of his motion for reduction of sentence under 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3582(c).     It being clear that no such relief is warranted, we\n\nsummarily affirm.\n\n             In relevant part, § 3582(c) provides that, where a\n\ndefendant was sentenced “based on a sentencing range that has\n\nsubsequently       been   lowered   by   the   Sentencing      Commission,”     the\n\ndistrict court may reduce that sentence “if such a reduction is\n\nconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the ...\n\nCommission.”    18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2).         A denial of § 3582(c) relief\n\nis reviewed for abuse of discretion.            See, e.g., United States v.\n\nHurley, 374 F.3d 38, 41 (1st Cir. 2004) (per curiam).\n\n             Defendant advances three separate justifications for a\n\nsentence reduction.         First, he points to Amendment 500 to the\n\nsentencing    guidelines,      which     involved    “role     in   the   offense”\n\ncalculations.       The amendment added an application note to U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 3B1.1 (the “aggravating role” provision) stating that an upward\n\nadjustment is appropriate only if the defendant managed “one or\n\nmore other participants”; exercising “management responsibility\n\nover   the    property,      assets,      or   activities      of    a    criminal\n\norganization” is not enough.              The Commission did not include\n\nAmendment    500    among   those   listed     in   U.S.S.G.    §   1B1.10(c)   as\n\neligible for retroactive application.               We note, in passing, that\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fthe amendment took effect in 1993 and that defendant provides no\n\nexplanation for his over-twelve-year delay in invoking same.\n\n          Defendant’s argument rests on three assertions: (1) that\n\nAmendment 500 is “clarifying” rather than “substantive”; (2) that\n\nthe amendment, for that reason, can be applied retroactively to\n\nobtain § 3582(c) relief despite its omission from § 1B1.10(c); and\n\n(3) that doing so here would result in a lower sentence.   There is\n\nno need to address the first two propositions, since the final one\n\nis plainly incorrect: the record makes clear that defendant managed\n\none or more other participants.    The presentence report (PSR), for\n\nexample, states in pertinent part as follows:\n\n          On June 1, 1992, the defendant instructed\n          codefendant Victor Rivera to acquire a vehicle\n          to transport the drug cargo and furnished the\n          undercover agent with such a vehicle. Under\n          his instructions codefendant Angel Galindez\n          delivered to the undercover agent $30,000.00\n          in exchange for the keys and location of the\n          truck containing the marijuana load.\n\n(Emphasis added.)   Indeed, the PSR explains that, upon the arrest\n\nof a key operative, defendant “agreed to continue in charge of the\n\ndrug smuggling operation”–-a point echoed in our opinion on direct\n\nappeal. See United States v. Rodríguez-Peña, 1995 WL 275691, at *1\n\n(1st Cir. 1995) (unpublished).    Moreover, the interpretation of §\n\n3B1.1 adopted by Amendment 500 was the one already prevailing in\n\nthis circuit; the amendment specifically identified United States\n\nv. Fuller, 897 F.2d 1217 (1st Cir. 1990), as one of the cases\n\nsupporting the view it was endorsing.    There is no indication that\n\n                                  -3-\n\fthe sentencing judge deviated from this precedent (a matter that\n\ncould     have    been-–but       was     not--raised       on    direct       appeal).\n\nAccordingly,       application     of     Amendment       500    would   not    change\n\ndefendant’s sentence.\n\n             Second, defendant contends that a § 3582(c) reduction is\n\nwarranted in the wake of United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220\n\n(2005),      on   the    theory    that    that   decision        “clarified”       the\n\nguidelines.       This argument has been roundly rejected.                 See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Price, 438 F.3d 1005, 1007 n.2 (10th Cir.) (citing\n\ncases), cert. denied, 126 S. Ct. 2365 (2006); United States v.\n\nMoreno, 421 F.3d 1217, 1220-21 (11th Cir. 2005) (per curiam), cert.\n\ndenied, 126 S. Ct. 1643 (2006).             Among other flaws, it overlooks\n\nthe   fact    that   §   3582(c)    only    allows    a    reduction     where     “the\n\nSentencing Commission, not the Supreme Court, has lowered the\n\n[sentencing] range.”        Price, 438 F.3d at 1007.             Moreover, because\n\ndefendant already has been denied relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2255,\n\nsuch an argument, if successful, would improperly bypass the\n\nsecond-or-successive regimen prescribed by § 2255 ¶ 8.\n\n             Finally, defendant seeks a sentence reduction because of\n\nhis extensive post-judgment rehabilitation.                      Yet such conduct,\n\nwhile commendable, has nothing to do with the lowering of the\n\nsentencing range by the Commission, as required by § 3582(c).\n\nAccordingly, such rehabilitation provides no basis either for a\n\nsentencing reduction in its own right, see, e.g., Quesada-Mosquera\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fv. United States, 243 F.3d 685, 686 (2d Cir. 2001), or for a\n\nfurther downward departure where a § 3582(c) reduction is ordered\n\nfor some other reason, see, e.g., United States v. Hasan, 245 F.3d\n\n682 (8th Cir. 2001) (en banc); cf. United States v. Jordan, 162 F.3d\n\n1 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n           Defendant also faults the district court for failing to\n\nexplain the basis for its § 3582(c) denial.    This complaint falls\n\nshort, inasmuch as defendant’s ineligibility for such relief is\n\nself-evident.   See generally Witty v. Dukakis, 3 F.3d 517, 521 (1st\n\nCir. 1993) (finding no need for district court explanation when\n\nreason for ruling is “apparent on the face of the record”).   In any\n\nevent, this court “can affirm on any basis available in the\n\nrecord.”   Peguero-Moronta v. Santiago, 464 F.3d 29, 34 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f",

Among other flaws, it overlooks the fact that &#167; 3582(c) only allows a reduction where \"the Sentencing Commission, not the Supreme Court, has lowered the [sentencing] range.\" <i>Price,</i> 438 F.3d at 1007. Moreover, because defendant already has been denied relief under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255, such an argument, if successful, would improperly bypass the second-or-successive regimen prescribed by &#167; 2255 &#182; 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, defendant seeks a sentence reduction because of his extensive post-judgment rehabilitation. Yet such conduct, while commendable, has nothing to do with the lowering of the sentencing range by the Commission, as required by &#167; 3582(c). Accordingly, such rehabilitation provides no basis either for a sentencing reduction in its own right, <i>see, e.g., Quesada-Mosquera v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772489\"><a href=\"/opinion/772489/javier-quesada-mosquera-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">243</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">685</span></a></span>, 686 (2d Cir.2001), or for a further downward departure where a &#167; 3582(c) reduction is ordered for some other reason, <i>see, e.g., United States v. Hasan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772716\"><a href=\"/opinion/772716/united-states-v-hamedah-a-hasan-also-known-as-stephanie-lomax/\"><span class=\"volume\">245</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">682</span></a></span> (8th Cir.2001) (en banc); <i>cf. United States v. Jordan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"759597\"><a href=\"/opinion/759597/united-states-v-barry-jordan/\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant also faults the district court for failing to explain the basis for its &#167; 3582(c) denial. This complaint falls short, inasmuch as defendant's ineligibility for such relief is self-evident. <i>See generally Witty v. Dukakis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194903\"><a href=\"/opinion/194903/witty-v-dukakis/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">517</span></a></span>, 521 (1st Cir.1993) (finding no need for district court explanation when reason for ruling is \"apparent on the face of the record\"). In any event, this court \"can affirm on any basis available in the record.\" <i>Peguero-Moronta v.
