Mary M. Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                         Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n                    Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                      and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Elaine Pourinski for appellant.\n     Donald Lockhart, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nRobert Clark Corrente, United States Attorney, and Stephen G.\nDambruch, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                          October 25, 2005\n\f              STAHL, Senior Circuit Judge.           Edgar Medina was convicted\n\nof illegal possession with intent to distribute cocaine base,\n\nheroin,   and    marijuana,        and   for     possession        of   a   firearm    in\n\nfurtherance of a drug trafficking crime. He appeals his conviction\n\nand his sentence, which was imposed under the Federal Sentencing\n\nGuidelines before they were held to be advisory rather than binding\n\non trial courts.        United States v. Booker, 125 S.Ct. 738 (2005).\n\nWe   affirm    the    conviction     but    remand      to   the    trial    court    for\n\nresentencing in light of Booker.\n\nI. Background\n\n              On February 7, 2004, the Providence Police responded to\n\na call from Iyonna Washington, who reported that Edgar Medina had\n\nthreatened      her   with   physical       harm   and       had   just     broken    the\n\nwindshield of her car with a silver gun.                When the officers arrived\n\nat the scene, Washington directed them to a nearby apartment to\n\nwhich she said Medina had retreated.                 Making their way into the\n\napartment with the permission of its owner, the police took Medina\n\ninto custody.\n\n              One of the arresting officers escorted Medina downstairs\n\nto a waiting patrol car, while the other stayed behind and, with\n\npermission,     searched     the    apartment      in    which      Medina    had    been\n\napprehended.      In a shoe box hidden under a bed, the officer found\n\na black hand gun, drug processing supplies, and a sizeable quantity\n\n\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fof drugs packed into small plastic bags.   The box also contained a\n\nnumber of documents, including court papers bearing Medina's name.\n\n            Medina was indicted on April 7, 2004, on charges that he\n\npossessed with intent to distribute over 50 grams of cocaine base\n\nin violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A)(iii); possessed\n\nwith intent to distribute quantities of heroin and marijuana in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C) and (b)(1)(D); and\n\npossessed a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A).   After a jury trial, he was\n\nconvicted on all counts.    The trial judge, expressing dismay over\n\nthe length of the sentence that the Guidelines obligated her to\n\nimpose on Medina, who was, she noted, just 19 years old at the time\n\nof the sentencing, imposed the minimum sentence available under the\n\nGuidelines for the drug charges, a term of 15 years, 8 months.   The\n\ngun possession charge carried an additional, statutorily-mandated\n\nconsecutive sentence of 5 years, bringing Medina’s total sentence\n\nto nearly 21 years.   Medina now appeals both his conviction and his\n\nsentence.\n\nII. Discussion\n\n            Medina challenges his conviction on three grounds. He\n\nargues that 1) his counsel failed to provide effective assistance;\n\n2) the trial court admitted evidence in violation of the Federal\n\nRules of Evidence; and 3) the trial court erroneously instructed\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fthe jury as to one of the drug charges.   Medina also challenges his\n\nsentence under Booker.    We address each challenge in turn.\n\n            A. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n            Medina claims that his counsel’s performance fell short\n\nof the Sixth Amendment standard for effective assistance set forth\n\nin Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984).    We generally do\n\nnot entertain claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct\n\nappeal.    United States v. Martinez-Vargas, 321 F.3d 245, 251 (1st\n\nCir. 2003).    We have repeatedly said that the habeas court is in a\n\nbetter position to explore the basis of an ineffective assistance\n\nclaim, and barring exceptional circumstances we will not examine\n\nsuch a claim unless and until it comes on appeal from the habeas\n\ncourt.    Medina points to no exceptional circumstances in this case\n\nthat would compel us to break with our usual practice, and so we\n\ndecline to review his ineffective assistance claims.\n\n            B. Admission of Evidence\n\n            The box in which the police found a cache of drugs also\n\ncontained a number of documents bearing Medina’s name.    Among the\n\npapers were a variety of court documents indicating that Medina had\n\npreviously been in trouble for “evading police” and which also\n\nlisted various fees and fines that he had been required to pay as\n\na result.     The prosecutor sought to introduce the documents in an\n\neffort to demonstrate that the contents of the box belonged to\n\nMedina.    Defense counsel declined the court’s invitation to object\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fand its offer to give the jury a limiting instruction with respect\n\nto the evidence admitted.   Medina now claims that the admission of\n\nthe documents at trial was barred by the Federal Rules of Evidence,\n\nwhich prohibit the use of evidence of prior acts “to show action in\n\nconformity therewith.”   Fed. R. Evid. 404(b).\n\n          Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b), a claim\n\nthat has been otherwise forfeited by a party’s failure to object at\n\ntrial will still be reviewed for plain error.       United States v.\n\nOlano, 507 U.S. 725 (1993).   Where a defendant has waived a rule,\n\nhowever, there is no error.      Id. at 732-33; United States v.\n\nRodriguez-Leon, 402 F.3d 17, 26 (1st Cir. 2005).1\n\n          Here the trial judge called a bench conference before the\n\nprosecution introduced the contested evidence.   She asked counsel,\n\n“You have no objection to these coming in?” to which counsel\n\nreplied, “Judge, I have no objection to them coming in.”   The judge\n\nthen asked, “Do you want a cautionary instruction? It appears to me\n\nit talks about fines --” Counsel interrupted the judge, saying,\n\n“Judge, it’s going to come out.       [Medina’s] going to take the\n\nstand.”\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      The extinguishment of error through waiver has been sometimes\ndescribed as precluding plain error review altogether. See, e.g.,\nRodriguez-Leon, 402 F.3d at 26 (“A party waives a right when he\nintentionally relinquishes or abandons it, and a waived issue\nordinarily cannot be raised on appeal.”) (citing United States v.\nRodriguez, 311 F.3d 435, 437 (1st Cir. 2002); United States v.\nMitchell, 85 F.3d 800, 807 (1st Cir. 1996)).\n\n                                -5-\n\f          A party’s considered decision not to avail itself of a\n\nprocedural   right,   evidenced   here   by   counsel’s   persistent   and\n\nreasoned refusal of the judge’s suggestions, waives that right.\n\nTrial counsel was entitled to make out his client’s case as he saw\n\nfit,2 and our even contemplating a claim of error here would imply\n\nan obligation on trial judges to second-guess counsel in a way that\n\nwould disturb that entitlement.     This we will not do.      See United\n\nStates v. Cartagena-Carrasquillo, 70 F.3d 706, 713 (1st Cir. 1995)\n\n(declining to impose obligation on trial court to issue limiting\n\ninstruction sua sponte).     We hold instead that Medina, through\n\ncounsel, waived any objection to the evidentiary admission at\n\nissue, and so we do not consider the argument.\n\n          C. Crack Cocaine\n\n          Medina urges that the trial court erred in instructing\n\nthe jury on the charge of possession of cocaine base. He did not\n\nraise this objection at trial.       In the absence of an objection\n\nbelow, we review the trial court’s instruction of the jury for\n\nplain error.   United States v. Bailey, 405 F.3d 102, 110 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).\n\n          The trial judge instructed the jury that, in order to\n\nsustain its burden of proof as to the cocaine base charge under 21\n\nU.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A)(iii), the government was required\n\n\n     2\n      Whether counsel’s decision was competent is of course another\nmatter, and Medina’s challenge on that claim will be brought before\nthe habeas court if Medina chooses to pursue it.\n\n                                  -6-\n\fto prove, inter alia, “that the controlled substance involved here\n\nwas   cocaine    base.”   Medina     claims      that   the    instruction    was\n\ndeficient because it permitted the jury to convict him under the\n\nstatute,   which     punishes     trafficking      in    “cocaine    base,”     §\n\n841(b)(1)(A)(iii), without determining whether the substance he\n\npossessed was the particular form of cocaine base known as “crack”\n\nor was rather some other form of cocaine base.\n\n           The     question     whether    the    statute      regulates     only\n\npossession of crack or whether its rule encompasses other forms of\n\ncocaine base is the subject of some debate and of a conflict among\n\nthe circuits.     See, e.g., United States v. Edwards, 397 F.3d 570,\n\n575-77 (7th Cir. 2005) (describing split).                    In this circuit,\n\nhowever, it is settled that 21 U.S.C. § 841 regulates exactly what\n\nits terms suggest: the possession of any form of “cocaine base.”\n\nUnited States v. Lopez-Gil, 965 F.2d 1124, 1134 (1st Cir. 1992)\n\n(opinion on rehearing); see also United States v. Richardson, 225\n\nF.3d 46, 49 (1st Cir. 2000).        Crack is a form of cocaine base and\n\nso is among the substances regulated by the statute, but the\n\ngovernment is not required to prove that the substance involved in\n\na given case is crack in order to secure a conviction under it.3\n\n\n      3\n      Medina’s argument, which does not advert to Lopez-Gil or its\nprogeny despite their clear applicability to this case, appears to\nbe predicated on a misunderstanding of the relationship between the\ncriminal statute prohibiting possession of cocaine base and the\nprovision of the Sentencing Guidelines that will sometimes suggest\na higher sentence when a defendant is convicted under the statute.\nSince 1993, the Sentencing Guidelines have specified that the term\n\n                                     -7-\n\fMedina   cannot    show     plain   error   because    the    trial       court’s\n\ninstructions were simply correct, and Medina’s challenge on this\n\nscore therefore also fails.\n\n            D. Resentencing Under Booker\n\n            Medina’s      several   convictions    subjected        him     to   a\n\nstatutorily-prescribed minimum sentence of 15 years, composed of a\n\nmandatory   10-year    sentence     under   21   U.S.C.   §   841     for    drug\n\npossession and a 5-year addition for the weapons count under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 924(c).       The trial court determined that the Federal\n\nSentencing Guidelines mandated a longer sentence for the drug-\n\npossession charges, and sentenced Medina to 15 years, 8 months for\n\nthe drugs, the minimum it believed the Guidelines permitted it to\n\nimpose. The Guidelines sentence and the consecutive 5-year sentence\n\nfor the weapons charge together left Medina facing a total sentence\n\nof 20 years, 8 months.\n\n            In the time since the sentencing, the United States\n\nSupreme Court decided Booker, which severed the provisions of the\n\nSentencing Guidelines that made those Guidelines binding on the\n\ndistrict courts.    Booker, 125 S.Ct. at 764.         Because this case was\n\n\n\n\n“cocaine base,” as used in the Guidelines, means “crack.”      See\nU.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c), Note (D). The definition in the guideline\nnote, however, is only relevant to the court at sentencing under §\n2D1.1(c), and not to the jury in coming to a verdict under 21\nU.S.C. § 841. What matters for the purposes of the conviction, and\nthus for the jury instruction, is the meaning of the term “cocaine\nbase” under the statute, which was resolved by Lopez-Gil.\n\n                                     -8-\n\fpending on direct review when Booker was decided, we are obligated\n\nto apply Booker to it.    Id. at 769.\n\n          We have held that “Booker error is established whenever\n\n‘a defendant's Guidelines sentence was imposed under a mandatory\n\nGuidelines system.’”     United States v. Fornia-Castillo, 408 F.3d\n\n52, 73 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting United States v. Antonakopoulos,\n\n399 F.3d 68, 75 (1st Cir. 2005)).        Where an objection to the\n\nmandatory application of the Guidelines was made before the trial\n\ncourt, the government has the burden of proving the harmlessness of\n\nthe error beyond a reasonable doubt.    Fornia-Castillo, 408 F.3d at\n\n73-74.   Here the government concedes that Medina preserved his\n\nBooker claim below, and further concedes that it cannot prove the\n\nharmlessness of the error.     It therefore agrees with Medina that\n\nremand for resentencing is warranted.    Accordingly, we remand the\n\ncase for resentencing in light of Booker.\n\nIII. Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the appellant’s conviction is\n\naffirmed, his sentence is vacated, and the case is remanded to the\n\ndistrict court for resentencing.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f",

In a shoe box hidden under a bed, the officer found a black hand gun, drug processing supplies, and a sizeable quantity of drugs packed into small plastic bags. The box also contained a number of documents, including court papers bearing Medina's name.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Medina was indicted on April 7, 2004, on charges that he possessed with intent to distribute over 50 grams of cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A)(iii); possessed with intent to distribute quantities of heroin and marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C) and (b)(1)(D); and possessed a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(A).

He argues that 1) his counsel failed to provide effective assistance; 2) the trial court admitted evidence in violation of the Federal Rules of Evidence; and 3) the trial court erroneously instructed the jury as to one of the drug charges. Medina also challenges his sentence under <i>Booker.</i> We address each challenge in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Medina claims that his counsel's performance fell short of the Sixth Amendment standard for effective assistance set forth in <i>Strickland v.

We affirm the conviction but remand to the trial court for resentencing in light of <i>Booker.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 7, 2004, the Providence Police responded to a call from Iyonna Washington, who reported that Edgar Medina had threatened her with physical harm and had just broken the windshield of her car with a silver gun. When the officers arrived at the scene, Washington directed them to a nearby apartment to which she said Medina had retreated. Making their way into the apartment with the permission of its owner, the police took Medina into custody.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of the arresting officers escorted Medina downstairs to a waiting patrol car, while the other stayed behind and, with permission, searched the apartment in which Medina had been apprehended. In a shoe box hidden under a bed, the officer found a black hand gun, drug processing supplies, and a sizeable quantity of drugs packed into small plastic bags. The box also contained a number of documents, including court papers bearing Medina's name.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Medina was indicted on April 7, 2004, on charges that he possessed with intent to distribute over 50 grams of cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A)(iii); possessed with intent to distribute quantities of heroin and marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C) and (b)(1)(D); and possessed a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(A). After a jury trial, he was convicted on all counts. The trial judge, expressing dismay over the length of the sentence that the Guidelines obligated her to impose on Medina, who was, she noted, just 19 years old at the time of the sentencing, imposed the minimum sentence available under the Guidelines for the drug charges, a term of 15 years, 8 months. The gun possession charge carried an additional, statutorily-mandated consecutive sentence of 5 years, bringing Medina's total sentence to nearly 21 years. Medina now appeals both his conviction and his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Medina challenges his conviction on three grounds. He argues that 1) his counsel failed to provide effective assistance; 2) the trial court admitted evidence in violation of the Federal Rules of Evidence; and 3) the trial court erroneously instructed the jury as to one of the drug charges. Medina also challenges his sentence under <i>Booker.</i> We address each challenge in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Medina claims that his counsel's performance fell short of the Sixth Amendment standard for effective assistance set forth in <i>Strickland v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">674</span></a></span> (1984). We generally do not entertain claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal. <i>United States v. Martinez-Vargas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200364\"><a href=\"/opinion/200364/united-states-v-martinez-vargas/\"><span class=\"volume\">321</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">245</span></a></span>, 251 (1st Cir.2003). We have repeatedly said that the habeas court is in a better position to explore the basis of an ineffective assistance claim, and barring exceptional circumstances we will not examine such a claim unless and until it comes on appeal from the habeas court. Medina points to no exceptional circumstances in this case that would compel us to break with our usual practice, and so we decline to review his ineffective assistance claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Admission of Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The box in which the police found a cache of drugs also contained a number of documents bearing Medina's name. Among the papers were a variety of court documents indicating that Medina had previously been in trouble for \"evading police\" and which also listed various fees and fines that he had been required to pay as a result. The prosecutor sought to introduce the documents in an effort to demonstrate that the contents of the box belonged to Medina. Defense counsel declined the court's invitation to object and its offer to give the jury a limiting instruction with respect to the evidence admitted. Medina now claims that the admission of the documents at trial was barred by the Federal Rules of Evidence, which prohibit the use of evidence of prior acts \"to show action in conformity therewith.\" Fed.R.Evid. 404(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b), a claim that has been otherwise forfeited by a party's failure to object at trial will still be reviewed for plain error. <i>United States v.

Since 1993, the Sentencing Guidelines have specified that the term \"cocaine base,\" as used in the Guidelines, means \"crack.\" <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(c), Note (D). The definition in the guideline note, however, is only relevant to the court at sentencing under &#167; 2D1.1(c), and not to the jury in coming to a verdict under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841. What matters for the purposes of the conviction, and thus for the jury instruction, is the meaning of the term \"cocaine base\" under the statute, which was resolved by <i>Lopez-Gil.</i></p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
