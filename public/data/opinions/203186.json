Petitioners Maria Adela\n\nLopez1 and her daughters Flor Katherin Roman-Nunez and Karen Roman-\n\nNunez, natives and citizens of Peru, petition for review of a final\n\norder of removal issued by the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\"\n\nor \"Board\") on February 28, 2007.            They contend that the Board\n\nabused its discretion when it denied their motion for a continuance\n\nand that denial of the continuance violated their due process\n\nrights.    We deny the petition for review.\n\n            The petitioners were admitted to the United States in\n\nMiami, Florida, on or about July 31, 2001 as nonimmigrant visitors\n\nwith permission to stay in the United States for a temporary period\n\nnot   to   exceed   January   30,    2002.    On   January   30,   2004,   the\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") issued Notices to Appear\n\ncharging petitioners with removal because they had overstayed their\n\ntime in the United States.          Petitioners admitted the charges and\n\nconceded removability.        Peru was designated as the country of\n\nremoval.\n\n            Maria Lopez appeared before the immigration judge (\"IJ\")\n\nwith counsel on April 28, 2005 (her daughters were excused from\n\ncoming to the hearing).             Their counsel informed the IJ that\n\npetitioners' visa applications had been denied but that they\n\nplanned to appeal from the denial.            They, therefore, sought a\n\n\n\n      1\n      Lopez is referred to as \"lead petitioner\" unless otherwise\nnoted, to avoid confusion with her claimed husband, Jorge Lopez.\n\n                                      -2-\n\fcontinuance of the removal proceedings in order to pursue their\n\nappeal from the visa denials.   Petitioners had contended in their\n\nvisa applications that because the lead petitioner (Maria Lopez)\n\nhad married an American citizen, Jorge Lopez, before her daughters\n\nreached the age of 18, all three petitioners were entitled to an\n\nadjustment of status.\n\n          The government opposed the continuance, noting that this\n\nwas the second denial of a visa petition (\"I-130\") in the case.\n\nThe government asserted that because the lead petitioner had\n\nengaged in marriage fraud she was barred from receiving a visa by\n\n8 U.S.C. ยง 1154(c) (prohibiting the granting of immigrant status to\n\nthose involved with marriage fraud). In connection with the motion\n\nto continue, however, the government had no objection to allowing\n\npetitioners to file a full copy of their visa petition and the\n\nevidence submitted in connection with it, along with the DHS's\n\ndecision and the appeal notice.    Petitioners' counsel was ordered\n\nto submit these materials to the immigration court by May 31, 2005.\n\n          At the next hearing, on June 23, 2005, petitioners'\n\ncounsel admitted he had not submitted the ordered materials by the\n\nprescribed date but said he had appealed from the visa denial and\n\nhad with him evidence of having done so.   The IJ responded that she\n\nhad given the May 31, 2005 date for submission of the visa petition\n\nproceedings so that she could review the application and supporting\n\ndocumentation to see if there was any merit to the continuance\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\frequest. Petitioners' counsel indicated that \"my sense is that the\n\nGovernment has some--some evidence that, in fact, the marriage was\n\nnot entered into in good faith.\"\n\n           The IJ noted that petitioners' counsel had yet to submit\n\nan actual motion for continuance.              In response, petitioners'\n\ncounsel stated he believed the \"best way to proceed\" was to have a\n\nhearing on the issue of voluntary departure and handle the visa\n\nissue on appeal to the Board.            He said that he had missed the\n\nfiling deadline due to the \"press of business.\"               The IJ granted\n\npetitioners' counsel another continuance of more than two months to\n\nsubmit the relevant information.             A hearing was scheduled for\n\nOctober 3, 2005 to decide whether a further continuance should be\n\ngranted and to rule on the application for voluntary departure.\n\nThe IJ informed counsel that any motion for a continuance was due\n\non or before September 21, 2005, and that the voluntary departure\n\nissue would be waived if he missed the date.\n\n           At a subsequent hearing held on November 9, 2005, the IJ\n\nnoted   that   DHS   had   submitted    as   evidence   an   I-130   filed   in\n\nSeptember 30, 2002, the notice of intent to deny, and the denial.\n\nAdditionally, DHS submitted a copy of the I-130 that had been\n\nresubmitted on November 23, 2004 and notice of denial of the second\n\npetition on April 18, 2005.      DHS opposed any further continuances.\n\nThe court pointed out there had been two denials of what was\n\nessentially the same visa petition and that apparently the second\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fdenial, dated April 18, 2005, was on appeal.        Petitioners' counsel\n\nindicated that he was attempting to gather evidence to address some\n\nof the DHS's concerns on appeal and offered some of that evidence\n\nat the instant hearing.    Counsel indicated he had copies for the\n\nDHS and the immigration court and that he would be seeking another\n\ncontinuance.\n\n            DHS stated it was opposed to any further continuances\n\nbased on petitioners' purported appeal from denial of the visa\n\npetition.    DHS counsel said there was a \"history of fraud and\n\nshammed marriage\" in the case and little prospect for success on\n\nthe appeal from the second denial.        The IJ agreed with DHS that a\n\ncontinuance was unwarranted.\n\n            Petitioners' counsel argued that medical evidence he\n\npresented concerning Jorge Lopez addressed some of the issues\n\nrelated to the denial of the I-130.          The IJ responded that the\n\nmedical evidence did not establish the existence of a marriage.\n\nThe IJ denied the motion for a continuance and then recessed to\n\nallow petitioners to speak to their attorney about applying for\n\nvoluntary   departure.    When    the    hearing   resumed,   petitioners'\n\ncounsel stated petitioners would not seek voluntary departure.\n\n            The IJ then denied the motion to continue in an opinion\n\nissued on November 9, 2005.      She found that the evidence submitted\n\ndid not establish any exceptional or actual hardship to Lopez.\n\nFurther, she found that the documentation did not compel a finding\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fdifferent from that arrived at by DHS.   She said the Board should\n\ndecide the I-130 appeal as quickly as possible. As petitioners did\n\nnot seek voluntary departure, she ordered them removed to Peru.\n\n           On February 28, 2007, the Board dismissed petitioners'\n\nappeal from the denial of the continuance.     The Board explained\n\nthat an IJ may grant a motion for continuance only for good cause\n\nshown and that a denial of such a motion will not be reversed\n\n\"unless the alien establishes that the denial caused her actual\n\nprejudice and harm and materially affected the outcome of her\n\ncase.\"   In re Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987).\n\n           The Board found that a review of the record showed that\n\non two occasions, Jorge Lopez filed an I-130 on behalf of Maria\n\nLopez and her children.   On November 21, 2003, in response to the\n\nfirst I-130, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"CIS\")\n\nissued a Notice of Intent to Deny detailing allegations of a sham\n\nmarriage between Maria and Jorge Lopez.      The Notice of Intent\n\nstated that the lead petitioner (Maria Lopez) was in fact married\n\nto Luis Roman, a Peruvian national and the father of her two\n\nchildren, with whom she resided in Cranston, Rhode Island.     The\n\nNotice went on to say she had previously provided sworn testimony\n\nto CIS that she had not been married and that the father of her\n\nchildren resided in Peru.   Her request to withdraw this petition\n\nwas rejected by CIS, and a final decision issued finding petitioner\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fhad entered into a sham marriage for the purpose of evading the\n\nimmigration laws.\n\n           The Board's decision went on to note that Jorge Lopez had\n\nrefiled the I-130 on behalf of the petitioners.                Supplemental\n\ninformation submitted by the lead petitioner acknowledged she was\n\nin fact married to Luis Roman when the original petition was filed\n\nbut said she had divorced him on May 6, 2004 and married Jorge\n\nLopez the next day.     Maria and Jorge Lopez were called to the local\n\nCIS office to provide testimony regarding the petition. CIS issued\n\na final decision on April 18, 2005, upholding its previous finding\n\nof marriage fraud. The decision contained a thorough review of the\n\nwholly   inconsistent    testimony    given   by   the   two   during   their\n\nseparate interviews with CIS.\n\n           The Board agreed with the IJ that petitioners had not\n\nshown good cause for a continuance.        The Board also questioned the\n\ntruth of petitioners' representation to the IJ that a valid appeal\n\nfrom the I-130 was pending before the Board.         The only evidence of\n\nsuch an appeal, the Board said, was a photocopy of an appeal and\n\nfee receipt dated May 5, 2005, but stamped by the immigration court\n\non September 21, 2005, well after the period for a timely appeal\n\nhad expired. Petitioners have submitted no evidence beyond the fee\n\nreceipt in support of their claim to have appealed.\n\n           On October 1, 2007, the Board denied the petitioners'\n\nmotion to reopen proceedings for adjustment of status.              In that\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fdecision, as to which no review action is pending, the Board\n\nobserved in a footnote that:\n\n      It is noted that the lead respondent [Maria Lopez]\n      asserts that she is the beneficiary of a Form I-130,\n      which was twice denied by the United States Citizenship\n      and Immigration Services (CIS). She further claims that\n      she appealed from the CIS denial to this Board. However,\n      the Board's electronic system does not confirm the filing\n      of the appeal, nor has the respondent provided a copy of\n      such.\n\n                                  Discussion\n\n              Petitioners argue that the BIA abused its discretion in\n\ndenying their request for a continuance to pursue their adjustment\n\nclaim.   They further argue that their due process rights were\n\nviolated.       We   find   a   conspicuous    absence   of   merit   in   both\n\ncontentions and deny the petition for review.\n\n              The Attorney General's regulations authorize immigration\n\njudges in their discretion to grant or deny continuances. 8 C.F.R.\n\nยง   1003.29     (\"The    immigration   judge    may   grant   a   motion   for\n\ncontinuance on good cause shown.\"); Alsamhouri v. Gonzales, 484\n\nF.3d 117, 122 (1st Cir. 2007); see also 8 C.F.R. ยง 1240.6 (\"the\n\nimmigration judge may grant a reasonable adjournment . . . for good\n\ncause shown.\").         The decision whether to continue a hearing is\n\ncommitted to the immigration judge's sound discretion, see In re\n\nSibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354, 356-57 (BIA 1983).              Thus, on a petition\n\nfor review, we review an IJ's denial of a continuance only for an\n\nabuse of discretion.        Feliz v. Gonzales, 487 F.3d 71, 73 (1st Cir.\n\n2007).   We have said that we will reverse only if the IJ \"made an\n\n                                       -8-\n\ferror of law or acted in a manner that is arbitrary or capricious.\"\n\nCruz-Bucheli v. Gonzales, 463 F.3d 105, 107 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\nNothing of the sort appears here.\n\n          As the Board found, the IJ did not abuse her discretion\n\nwhen she denied petitioners' motion for continuance.              There was\n\nstrong, indeed overwhelming, evidence in the record of the visa\n\npetition proceedings supporting the DHS's determination of marriage\n\nfraud and its recorded denial of the I-130.\n\n          The     Board,   in   its    review,   examined   the    evidence\n\ncarefully, as have we.      Petitioners' testimony was studded with\n\ninconsistencies, and the record plainly justified the finding of\n\nmarriage fraud.     There was little reason to believe that finding\n\nwould be overturned on appeal.\n\n          Additionally, the Board determined that while petitioners\n\nargued, in justification of a continuance, that they had appealed\n\nto the Board from the second I-130 denial, the only evidence of an\n\nappeal was a fee receipt dated May 5, 2005 and a copy of a notice\n\nof appeal stamped on September 21, 2005, well after expiration of\n\nthe period allowed for filing an appeal.          8 U.S.C. ยง 1003.38(b).\n\nIn its October 1, 2007 denial of the petitioners' motion to reopen,\n\nthe Board once again noted that there was no record of the filing\n\nof an appeal and that the petitioners had not provided a copy of\n\none.   Moreover, even if a valid appeal were pending, the Board\n\nreasonably found that \"good cause is not shown by requesting a\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fcontinuance to await the results of a collateral event, which may\n\noccur at some indefinite time in the future, and the outcome of\n\nwhich, may or may not be favorable\" to petitioners.                There was no\n\nabuse of discretion in the denial of the motion for a continuance.\n\n            Petitioners also argue they were not provided with due\n\nprocess because CIS \"appeared gratuitously harsh\" to the family and\n\nbecause   they    were   not   represented    by   counsel    in   their    I-130\n\napplication.      We review constitutional claims de novo.                 Ibe v.\n\nGonzales, 415 F.3d 142, 144 (1st Cir. 2005).                 An alien may not\n\npredicate a due process claim on a denial of adjustment of status\n\nbecause it is a discretionary form of relief in which the alien has\n\nno cognizable liberty interest.           Naeem v. Gonzales, 469 F.3d 33,\n\n38-39 (1st Cir. 2007).         Moreover, there is no evidence here of\n\nundue harshness by anyone.\n\n            Further, petitioners have failed to show any prejudice.\n\n\"[B]efore   a    petitioner    in   an   immigration   case    may   advance    a\n\nprocedural due process claim, he must allege some cognizable\n\nprejudice fairly attributable to the challenged process.\"                  Lattab\n\nv. Ashcroft, 384 F.3d 8, 20 (1st Cir. 2004).           Petitioners contend\n\nthey had no opportunity to rebut the claims against them, but they\n\ncould have responded to the Notice of Intent to Deny and attempted\n\nto explain why the DHS's evidence of marriage fraud was incorrect\n\nor insufficient.     Petitioners had their petitions reviewed twice,\n\nand they have yet to show that the proceedings were \"fundamentally\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\funfair.\"   Jobe v. INS, 238 F.3d 97, 98 n.3 (1st Cir. 2001) (en\n\nbanc) (quoting Bernal-Vallejo v. INS, 195 F.3d 56, 63 (1st Cir.\n\n1999)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n           Petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                               -11-\n\f",

Petitioners Maria Adela\n\nLopez1 and her daughters Flor Katherin Roman-Nunez and Karen Roman-\n\nNunez, natives and citizens of Peru, petition for review of a final\n\norder of removal issued by the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\"\n\nor \"Board\") on February 28, 2007.            They contend that the Board\n\nabused its discretion when it denied their motion for a continuance\n\nand that denial of the continuance violated their due process\n\nrights.

A hearing was scheduled for\n\nOctober 3, 2005 to decide whether a further continuance should be\n\ngranted and to rule on the application for voluntary departure.\n\nThe IJ informed counsel that any motion for a continuance was due\n\non or before September 21, 2005, and that the voluntary departure\n\nissue would be waived if he missed the date.\n\n           At a subsequent hearing held on November 9, 2005, the IJ\n\nnoted   that   DHS   had   submitted    as   evidence   an   I-130   filed   in\n\nSeptember 30, 2002, the notice of intent to deny, and the denial.\n\nAdditionally, DHS submitted a copy of the I-130 that had been\n\nresubmitted on November 23, 2004 and notice of denial of the second\n\npetition on April 18, 2005.      DHS opposed any further continuances.\n\nThe court pointed out there had been two denials of what was\n\nessentially the same visa petition and that apparently the second\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fdenial, dated April 18, 2005, was on appeal.        Petitioners' counsel\n\nindicated that he was attempting to gather evidence to address some\n\nof the DHS's concerns on appeal and offered some of that evidence\n\nat the instant hearing.    Counsel indicated he had copies for the\n\nDHS and the immigration court and that he would be seeking another\n\ncontinuance.\n\n            DHS stated it was opposed to any further continuances\n\nbased on petitioners' purported appeal from denial of the visa\n\npetition.    DHS counsel said there was a \"history of fraud and\n\nshammed marriage\" in the case and little prospect for success on\n\nthe appeal from the second denial.        The IJ agreed with DHS that a\n\ncontinuance was unwarranted.\n\n            Petitioners' counsel argued that medical evidence he\n\npresented concerning Jorge Lopez addressed some of the issues\n\nrelated to the denial of the I-130.          The IJ responded that the\n\nmedical evidence did not establish the existence of a marriage.\n\nThe IJ denied the motion for a continuance and then recessed to\n\nallow petitioners to speak to their attorney about applying for\n\nvoluntary   departure.    When    the    hearing   resumed,   petitioners'\n\ncounsel stated petitioners would not seek voluntary departure.\n\n            The IJ then denied the motion to continue in an opinion\n\nissued on November 9, 2005.      She found that the evidence submitted\n\ndid not establish any exceptional or actual hardship to Lopez.\n\nFurther, she found that the documentation did not compel a finding\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fdifferent from that arrived at by DHS.   She said the Board should\n\ndecide the I-130 appeal as quickly as possible. As petitioners did\n\nnot seek voluntary departure, she ordered them removed to Peru.\n\n           On February 28, 2007, the Board dismissed petitioners'\n\nappeal from the denial of the continuance.     The Board explained\n\nthat an IJ may grant a motion for continuance only for good cause\n\nshown and that a denial of such a motion will not be reversed\n\n\"unless the alien establishes that the denial caused her actual\n\nprejudice and harm and materially affected the outcome of her\n\ncase.\"   In re Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987).\n\n           The Board found that a review of the record showed that\n\non two occasions, Jorge Lopez filed an I-130 on behalf of Maria\n\nLopez and her children.   On November 21, 2003, in response to the\n\nfirst I-130, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"CIS\")\n\nissued a Notice of Intent to Deny detailing allegations of a sham\n\nmarriage between Maria and Jorge Lopez.      The Notice of Intent\n\nstated that the lead petitioner (Maria Lopez) was in fact married\n\nto Luis Roman, a Peruvian national and the father of her two\n\nchildren, with whom she resided in Cranston, Rhode Island.     The\n\nNotice went on to say she had previously provided sworn testimony\n\nto CIS that she had not been married and that the father of her\n\nchildren resided in Peru.   Her request to withdraw this petition\n\nwas rejected by CIS, and a final decision issued finding petitioner\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fhad entered into a sham marriage for the purpose of evading the\n\nimmigration laws.\n\n           The Board's decision went on to note that Jorge Lopez had\n\nrefiled the I-130 on behalf of the petitioners.                Supplemental\n\ninformation submitted by the lead petitioner acknowledged she was\n\nin fact married to Luis Roman when the original petition was filed\n\nbut said she had divorced him on May 6, 2004 and married Jorge\n\nLopez the next day.     Maria and Jorge Lopez were called to the local\n\nCIS office to provide testimony regarding the petition. CIS issued\n\na final decision on April 18, 2005, upholding its previous finding\n\nof marriage fraud. The decision contained a thorough review of the\n\nwholly   inconsistent    testimony    given   by   the   two   during   their\n\nseparate interviews with CIS.\n\n           The Board agreed with the IJ that petitioners had not\n\nshown good cause for a continuance.        The Board also questioned the\n\ntruth of petitioners' representation to the IJ that a valid appeal\n\nfrom the I-130 was pending before the Board.         The only evidence of\n\nsuch an appeal, the Board said, was a photocopy of an appeal and\n\nfee receipt dated May 5, 2005, but stamped by the immigration court\n\non September 21, 2005, well after the period for a timely appeal\n\nhad expired. Petitioners have submitted no evidence beyond the fee\n\nreceipt in support of their claim to have appealed.\n\n           On October 1, 2007, the Board denied the petitioners'\n\nmotion to reopen proceedings for adjustment of status.              In that\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fdecision, as to which no review action is pending, the Board\n\nobserved in a footnote that:\n\n      It is noted that the lead respondent [Maria Lopez]\n      asserts that she is the beneficiary of a Form I-130,\n      which was twice denied by the United States Citizenship\n      and Immigration Services (CIS). She further claims that\n      she appealed from the CIS denial to this Board. However,\n      the Board's electronic system does not confirm the filing\n      of the appeal, nor has the respondent provided a copy of\n      such.\n\n                                  Discussion\n\n              Petitioners argue that the BIA abused its discretion in\n\ndenying their request for a continuance to pursue their adjustment\n\nclaim.   They further argue that their due process rights were\n\nviolated.       We   find   a   conspicuous    absence   of   merit   in   both\n\ncontentions and deny the petition for review.\n\n              The Attorney General's regulations authorize immigration\n\njudges in their discretion to grant or deny continuances. 8 C.F.R.\n\nยง   1003.29     (\"The    immigration   judge    may   grant   a   motion   for\n\ncontinuance on good cause shown.\"); Alsamhouri v.

The decision whether to continue a hearing is\n\ncommitted to the immigration judge's sound discretion, see In re\n\nSibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354, 356-57 (BIA 1983).              Thus, on a petition\n\nfor review, we review an IJ's denial of a continuance only for an\n\nabuse of discretion.        Feliz v.

We have said that we will reverse only if the IJ \"made an\n\n                                       -8-\n\ferror of law or acted in a manner that is arbitrary or capricious.\"\n\nCruz-Bucheli v.

There was\n\nstrong, indeed overwhelming, evidence in the record of the visa\n\npetition proceedings supporting the DHS's determination of marriage\n\nfraud and its recorded denial of the I-130.\n\n          The     Board,   in   its    review,   examined   the    evidence\n\ncarefully, as have we.      Petitioners' testimony was studded with\n\ninconsistencies, and the record plainly justified the finding of\n\nmarriage fraud.     There was little reason to believe that finding\n\nwould be overturned on appeal.\n\n          Additionally, the Board determined that while petitioners\n\nargued, in justification of a continuance, that they had appealed\n\nto the Board from the second I-130 denial, the only evidence of an\n\nappeal was a fee receipt dated May 5, 2005 and a copy of a notice\n\nof appeal stamped on September 21, 2005, well after expiration of\n\nthe period allowed for filing an appeal.          8 U.S.C. ยง 1003.38(b).\n\nIn its October 1, 2007 denial of the petitioners' motion to reopen,\n\nthe Board once again noted that there was no record of the filing\n\nof an appeal and that the petitioners had not provided a copy of\n\none.   Moreover, even if a valid appeal were pending, the Board\n\nreasonably found that \"good cause is not shown by requesting a\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fcontinuance to await the results of a collateral event, which may\n\noccur at some indefinite time in the future, and the outcome of\n\nwhich, may or may not be favorable\" to petitioners.                There was no\n\nabuse of discretion in the denial of the motion for a continuance.\n\n            Petitioners also argue they were not provided with due\n\nprocess because CIS \"appeared gratuitously harsh\" to the family and\n\nbecause   they    were   not   represented    by   counsel    in   their    I-130\n\napplication.      We review constitutional claims de novo.

An alien may not\n\npredicate a due process claim on a denial of adjustment of status\n\nbecause it is a discretionary form of relief in which the alien has\n\nno cognizable liberty interest.

Moreover, there is no evidence here of\n\nundue harshness by anyone.\n\n            Further, petitioners have failed to show any prejudice.\n\n\"[B]efore   a    petitioner    in   an   immigration   case    may   advance    a\n\nprocedural due process claim, he must allege some cognizable\n\nprejudice fairly attributable to the challenged process.\"                  Lattab\n\nv.
