App. P. 43(c)(2).\n\f              Per Curiam.     Angel Eladio Sena is a citizen of the\n\nDominican Republic who attained permanent resident status in the\n\nUnited States on December 1, 1990.        On January 28, 1994, Sena pled\n\nguilty in the United States District Court for the District of\n\nPuerto Rico to the crime of \"encourag[ing] or induc[ing] an alien\n\nto . . . reside in the United States, knowing or in reckless\n\ndisregard of the fact that such . . . residence is or will be in\n\nviolation of law.\"      8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(iv) (2000).1           He was\n\nconvicted pursuant to this plea in May 1994 and sentenced to three\n\nyears probation.\n\n              On March 4, 1997, the Immigration and Naturalization\n\nService (\"INS\") issued an Order to Show Cause, charging Sena with\n\nbeing deportable under section 241(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration\n\nand   Naturalization    Act   (\"INA\")    as   an    alien   convicted    of   an\n\n\n\n\n      1\n          The count to which Sena pled guilty reads as follows:\n\n              On or about the 12th day of August, 1993, in\n              the District of Puerto Rico and within the\n              jurisdiction of this Court, ANGEL SENA the\n              defendant herein, knowing that a number of\n              aliens . . . had come to, entered, or remained\n              in the United States in violation of Law, did\n              encourage the above mentioned aliens to reside\n              in the United States in reckless disregard of\n              the fact that said residence was in violation\n              of law. All in violation of Title 8, United\n              States Code, Section 1324(a)(1)(D).\n\nIn 1994, section        1324(a)(1)(D)    was       reclassified   as    section\n1324(a)(1)(A)(iv).\n\n                                   -2-\n\f\"aggravated felony.\"2    At the time of Sena's plea agreement, his\n\noffense was arguably not classified as an aggravated felony, but\n\nSena concedes that subsequent amendments to the definition of\n\n\"aggravated felony\" in the immigration statutes have made it clear\n\nthat the offense for which Sena was convicted is at present an\n\naggravated felony for purposes of INA section 241(a)(2)(A)(iii).\n\nSee 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(N).\n\n           Sena was ordered deported by an immigration judge on\n\nMarch 23, 2000. The immigration judge found that Sena's conviction\n\nconstituted an aggravated felony for which he could be deported; he\n\nfurther determined that recent amendments to the immigration laws\n\nprecluded Sena from applying for relief pursuant to INA section\n\n212(c), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c)3--a discretionary waiver program that\n\noriginally applied only to aliens facing exclusion from the United\n\nStates, but which has since been extended by numerous federal\n\ncourts   (including   this   one)   to    cover   certain   aliens   facing\n\ndeportation, see Campos v. INS, 961 F.2d 309, 313 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\nOn October 31, 2002, the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\")\n\n\n\n     2\n      The INA provision authorizing deportation of \"[a]ny alien who\nis convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission\"\nis now codified at 8 U.S.C. section 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). The INS\nalso initially charged Sena with being deportable under section\n241(a)(2)(A)(i) of the INA as an alien convicted of a crime of\nmoral turpitude, but it subsequently withdrew this latter charge.\n     3\n      This subsection was repealed by the Illegal Immigration\nReform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\"IIRIRA\"), Pub. L.\nNo. 104-208, Div. C, Title III, § 304(b), 110 Stat. 3009, 3009-597.\n\n                                    -3-\n\fremanded the case to the immigration judge in light of the Supreme\n\nCourt's holding in INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 326 (2001), that\n\nsection 212(c) relief remained available to aliens who pled guilty\n\nprior to the effective date of the INA amendments.\n\n             On remand, the immigration judge once more found that\n\nSena was ineligible for a section 212(c) waiver.                 This time, the\n\njudge first noted (in accordance with INS precedent) that aliens\n\nfacing deportation can apply for a section 212(c) waiver only if\n\nthe ground for which they are being deported is comparable to one\n\nfor which an alien could also be excluded under INA section 212(a).\n\nHe    then   determined   that    the   ground   on   which   Sena      was   being\n\ndeported--his prior conviction for encouraging or inducing illegal\n\nresidency--was not comparable to any ground for which an alien\n\ncould be excluded.         The BIA affirmed the immigration judge's\n\ndecision on July 7, 2004, and this appeal followed.\n\n             The government spends much of its brief arguing that we\n\ndo not have jurisdiction to hear Sena's case, because it is\n\ngoverned by a transitional rule enacted as part of the Illegal\n\nImmigration      Reform   and    Immigrant    Responsibility      Act    of   1996\n\n(\"IIRIRA\"), Pub. L. No. 104-208, Div. C, 110 Stat. 3009, which\n\nprecludes judicial review of final orders of removal for aliens who\n\nare removable by reason of having committed an aggravated felony,\n\nsee    id.   §   309(c)(4)(G),    110   Stat.    at   3009-626    to    3009-627.\n\nCongress's recent amendments to the INA, however, make clear that\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fwe have jurisdiction to consider all of Sena's claims.      See REAL ID\n\nAct of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-13, Div. B, § 106(a)(1)(A)(iii), 119\n\nStat. 231, 310 (to be codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D)).4\n\n             On the merits, Sena first argues that the retroactive\n\napplication of the broader aggravated felony definition to qualify\n\nhim, on the basis of his earlier guilty plea, for deportation is an\n\nunconstitutional violation of due process.      He seeks only rational\n\nbasis review, and we cannot say that Congress lacked any \"facially\n\nlegitimate and bona fide reason,\" Campos, 961 F.2d at 316 (quoting\n\nFiallo v. Bell, 430 U.S. 787, 794 (1977)), for applying the\n\nexpanded     definition   of   aggravated   felony   retroactively,   to\n\nencompass cases like Sena's.\n\n             As the Second Circuit said in rejecting an identical due\n\nprocess challenge to the retroactive application of an expanded\n\ndefinition of \"aggravated felony\" (albeit in the context of a\n\ndifferent crime than that for which Sena was convicted):\n\n\n\n     4\n         The new section reads:\n\n             (D) Judicial review of certain legal claims\n\n             Nothing in subparagraph (B) or (C), or in any\n             other provision of this chapter (other than\n             this section) which limits or eliminates\n             judicial review, shall be construed as\n             precluding review of constitutional claims or\n             questions of law raised upon a petition for\n             review filed with an appropriate court of\n             appeals in accordance with this section.\n             (emphasis added)\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f            Congress   has   a  legitimate  interest   in\n            protecting society from the commission of\n            aggravated felonies as well as the illegal\n            trafficking, possession, and use of dangerous\n            weapons, and legislation that deports aliens\n            who presently commit or who have committed\n            those acts in the past is a rational means of\n            furthering that interest. Congress also has a\n            narrower and equally legitimate interest in\n            expeditiously removing dangerous aliens from\n            the country, and uniform application of the\n            new statute to remove all aliens convicted of\n            certain offenses rationally furthers that\n            purpose as well.\n\nKuhali v. Reno, 266 F.3d 93, 111 (2d Cir. 2001); see also Hamama v.\n\nINS,   78   F.3d   233,   235-36   (6th    Cir.   1996);   United   States   v.\n\nYacoubian, 24 F.3d 1, 7-8 (9th Cir. 1994).\n\n            We reject Sena's attempt to distinguish cases such as\n\nKuhali by arguing that the crimes made grounds for deportation in\n\nthose cases are more dangerous than the crime for which he was\n\nconvicted.    Given the particular deference we must accord Congress\n\nwhen it legislates in the area of immigration, see Campos, 961 F.2d\n\nat 316, we cannot say it is irrational for Congress to choose to\n\ncombat illegal immigration by deporting aliens who have been\n\nconvicted of encouraging illegal immigrants to remain in U.S.\n\nterritory, even if Congress's choice operates far more harshly than\n\nSena believes is fair, cf. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. at 316, or permits\n\ndeportation of some individuals who may in fact pose no further\n\nthreat of breaking federal immigration laws, cf. N.Y. City Transit\n\nAuth. v. Beazer, 440 U.S. 568, 592-94 (1979); Williamson v. Lee\n\nOptical of Oklahoma, 348 U.S. 483, 487-88 (1955).\n\n                                     -6-\n\f           Sena next argues that he does meet the eligibility\n\nrequirements under (now-repealed) section 212(c) of the INA.            This\n\ncourt has fully endorsed the Attorney General's ruling in Matter of\n\nHernandez-Casillas, 20 I. & N. Dec. 262, 280 (A.G. 1991), that an\n\nalien facing deportation cannot seek a waiver under section 212(c)\n\nfor \"deportation grounds lacking any corresponding, statutorily-\n\nreferenced ground for excludability\"--i.e., the grounds for which\n\nthe alien is being deported must correspond to one of \"the grounds\n\nspecifically referred to in § 212(a)\" of the INA, 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1182(a).   See Campos, 961 F.2d at 313-14.\n\n           Sena first contends that he need not point to a ground\n\nfor exclusion in INA section 212(a) \"because there could not\n\nconceivably    be   an   analogous    ground   of   exclusion   based     on\n\nPetitioner's   specific    conviction.\"        We   find   Sena's   premise\n\nmistaken: someone outside the United States could encourage someone\n\nwithin it to remain (e.g., by letter or funding).             Our earlier\n\ndecision in Campos does require a comparable ground of exclusion\n\nfor Sena to prevail.     See 961 F.2d at 313-14.\n\n           Sena's second contention is that the offense for which he\n\nwas deported--\"encourag[ing] or induc[ing] an alien to . . . reside\n\nin the United States, knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact\n\nthat such . . . residence is or will be in violation of law,\" 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(iv)--is comparable to the enumerated ground\n\nfor exclusion for alien smuggling, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(E).            This\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fargument also fails.         The criminal offense for which Sena was\n\nconvicted--encouraging or inducing continued illegal residence--\n\ncriminalizes a different activity than those activities listed as\n\ngrounds    for   exclusion    under    the    provision   Sena   claims    is\n\n\"comparable,\"     8     U.S.C.   section       1182(a)(6)(E)--encouraging,\n\ninducing, assisting, aiding or abetting illegal entry or attempted\n\nentry.     In other words, one simply could not be excluded under 8\n\nU.S.C. section 1182(a)(6)(E) for the category of criminal behavior\n\nfor which Sena was convicted (and then deported under 8 U.S.C.\n\nsections    1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)     and      1101(a)(43)(N)).     Under    our\n\nprecedent in Campos, Sena cannot claim comparability and so is\n\nineligible for a section 212(c) waiver.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\f",

On January 28, 1994, Sena pled guilty in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico to the crime of \"encourag[ing] or induc[ing] an alien to ... reside in the United States, knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that such ... residence is or will be in violation of law.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1324(a)(1)(A)(iv) (2000).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> He was convicted pursuant to this plea in May 1994 and sentenced to three years probation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 4, 1997, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") issued an Order to Show Cause, charging Sena with being deportable under section 241(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act (\"INA\") as an alien convicted of an \"aggravated felony.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> At the time of Sena's plea agreement, his offense was arguably not classified as an aggravated felony, but Sena concedes that subsequent amendments to the definition of \"aggravated felony\" in the immigration statutes have made it clear that the offense for which Sena was convicted is at present an aggravated felony for purposes of INA section 241(a)(2)(A)(iii). <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(43)(N).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sena was ordered deported by an immigration judge on March 23, 2000. The immigration judge found that Sena's conviction constituted an aggravated felony for which he could be deported; he further determined that recent amendments to the immigration laws precluded Sena from applying for relief pursuant to INA section 212(c), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(c)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> &#8212; a discretionary waiver program that originally applied only to aliens facing <i>exclusion</i> from the United States, but which has since been extended by numerous federal courts (including this one) to cover certain aliens facing <i>deportation, see Campos v.

This time, the judge first noted (in accordance with INS precedent) that aliens facing <i>deportation</i> can apply for a section 212(c) waiver only if the ground for which they are being deported is comparable to one for which an alien could also be <i>excluded</i> under INA section 212(a). He then determined that the ground on which Sena was being deported &#8212; his prior conviction for encouraging or inducing illegal residency &#8212; was not comparable to any ground for which an alien could be excluded. The BIA affirmed the immigration judge's decision on July 7, 2004, and this appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government spends much of its brief arguing that we do not have jurisdiction to hear Sena's case, because it is governed by a transitional rule enacted as part of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\"IIRIRA\"), Pub.L.

Congress's recent amendments to the INA, however, make clear that we have jurisdiction to consider all of Sena's claims. <i>See</i> REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, Div.
