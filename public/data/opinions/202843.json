John A. Woodcock, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Richard N. Foley on brief for appellant.\n     F. Mark Terison, Senior Litigation Counsel, and Paula D.\nSilsby, United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                             July 13, 2007\n\f           Per Curiam.       After a thorough review of the record and\n\nof the parties' submissions, we affirm.\n\n           Appellant Darrell Dolliver (\"Dolliver\") challenges the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)(i). His arguments do not acknowledge that he\n\nwas convicted of possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug\n\ntrafficking crime, rather than use of a firearm during and in\n\nrelation to a drug-trafficking crime, and he does not present any\n\nauthority suggesting that his behavior here -- the bartering of\n\ndrugs for firearms -- falls outside the reach of that statute as\n\namended by Congress in 1998.          Cf. United States v. Luke-Sanchez,\n\n483 F.3d 703, 706 (10th Cir. 2007) (holding that trading drugs for\n\nguns constitutes possession in furtherance of a drug trafficking\n\ncrime under subsection 924(c)(1)); United States v. Boyd, 209 Fed.\n\nAppx.   285,   290   (4th   Cir.    2006)   (\"We   conclude   that       accepting\n\npossession of firearms as payment for crack cocaine is possession\n\nin furtherance of a drug trafficking crime.\"); United States v.\n\nFrederick, 406 F.3d 754 (6th Cir. 2005) (\"As a matter of logic, a\n\ndefendant's    willingness     to     accept   possession     of     a    gun   as\n\nconsideration for some drugs he wishes to sell does promote or\n\nfacilitate that illegal sale.\"); United States v. Cox, 324 F.3d 77,\n\n84 n. 2 (2d Cir. 2003) (\"For defendants charged under § 924(c)\n\nafter [the 1998] amendment, trading drugs for guns will probably\n\nresult in [a conviction for possession in furtherance of a drug\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\ftrafficking crime.]\").    Given Dolliver's failure to present any\n\nargument in contravention of this growing consensus, we see no\n\nreason to set aside his conviction.\n\n          Dolliver next contends that the district court failed to\n\nconsider the factors in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) when setting his\n\nsentence. On the contrary, the court stated that it had considered\n\nthose factors, and in explaining its sentence to Dolliver, it\n\nemphasized two of those factors:      the nature of the offenses in\n\nquestion, and the need to protect the public.     See 18 U.S.C. §§\n\n3553(a)(1) & (b)(2)(C).   The court was not required explicitly to\n\naddress all of the other factors in subsection 3553(a). \"While the\n\ncourt ordinarily should identify the main factors upon which it\n\nrelies, its statement need not be either lengthy or detailed.\"\n\nUnited States v. Turbides-Leonardo, 468 F.3d 34, 40 (1st Cir.\n\n2006), cert. denied, No. 06-9416, 2007 WL 469935 (June 29, 2007)\n\n(citing United States v. Navedo-Concepcion, 450 F.3d 54, 58 (1st\n\nCir. 2006)).    Here, the court stated that while it was not\n\naccepting the government's recommendation that his sentence be 12\n\nmonths above the bottom of the range, it was imposing a sentence\n\nsix months above the bottom of the range in recognition of the fact\n\nthat Dolliver had pled guilty not only to a firearms offense but to\n\na drug offense as well, and that the drug in question -- heroin --\n\nwas one of \"the most addictive and hardest drugs known to man.\"\n\nThe court's explanation was sufficient.\n\n\n                                -3-\n\f          Finally, Dolliver argues that in setting his sentence,\n\nthe   court    improperly    relied   upon   the    information   in   a\n\npsychiatrist's report prepared prior to his guilty plea and bench\n\ntrial.   See Fed. R. Crim. P. 12.2(c)(4).          On the contrary, the\n\ncourt rejected the government's suggestion that the court use the\n\nadmissions in that report.      In announcing its sentence, the court\n\nwas careful to state that while it was clear Dolliver had engaged\n\nin drug dealing, \"the extent of [the evidence of] that illegal\n\nconduct, however, is not compelling,\" and for this reason, it\n\nrejected the government's recommendation of a 96-month sentence.\n\n          The court may have relied on the statement in the Pre-\n\nSentence Report (\"PSR\") that Dolliver had a \"30-bag-a-day\" heroin\n\nhabit (a fact from which the court might have inferred that\n\nDolliver sold a substantial amount of drugs in order to support his\n\nhabit), and it appears this statement was taken by the probation\n\nofficer from the psychiatrist's report.       But, Dolliver told the\n\ncourt at sentencing that it had no objection to the contents of the\n\nPSR, so it seems he has waived any challenge to inclusion of this\n\nstatement in the PSR.       See Turbides-Leondardo, 468 F.3d at 38.\n\nEven if Dolliver's acquiescence did not constitute a waiver, it\n\ncertainly amounted to a forfeiture, and we would review only for\n\nplain error.    See id.     We see no plain error requiring reversal.\n\nIt is far from clear that the district court relied on the\n\nstatement at sentencing -- it did, after all, acknowledge that the\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fevidence of the extent of his drug-dealing was \"not compelling\" --\n\nso Dolliver has not shown that inclusion of the statement in the\n\nPSR affected his substantial rights or seriously impaired the\n\nfairness of these proceedings.    See United States v. Olano, 507\n\nU.S. 725, 732 (1993).\n\n          Affirmed.   See 1st Cir. R. 27.0(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f",
