GREEN,\n\n                        Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                                     v.\n\n                 CONCORD BAPTIST CHURCH, ET AL.,\n\n                       Defendants, Appellees.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n         [Hon. Richard G. Stearns, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                        Lynch, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Randolph E. Green on brief pro se\n\n\n\n                             March 9, 2009\n\f            Per Curiam.      Plaintiff Randolph Green appeals from a\n\ndistrict court order dismissing his pro se complaint just ten days\n\nafter it was filed. Finding plaintiff's allegations to be not just\n\nmeritless   but    incurably     so,   the    court   entered    the     order    of\n\ndismissal sua sponte without prior notice or leave to amend.                     Such\n\na disposition is appropriate only in egregious cases.                  Yet even if\n\nthe court acted prematurely, we would regard any such error as\n\nharmless, since it is by now clear that an opportunity to amend the\n\ncomplaint would be futile.        We thus affirm.\n\n            In    his   vague,    bare-boned      complaint,         plaintiff    is\n\napparently complaining about the sale of a church in Boston,\n\nMassachusetts of which he has been a member for 62 years.                 Named as\n\ndefendants are the \"Concord Baptist Church Corporation\" and the\n\n\"Housing Economic Development Corporation,\" neither of which is\n\nfurther identified.      Plaintiff claims to have a property interest\n\nin the former, although he provides no explanation.                  The complaint\n\nfocuses on a meeting of church officials at which the decision to\n\nsell was apparently made.          Among his contentions are that the\n\nmeeting was unlawful; his right to vote on the proposal was\n\nabridged;   the    church   lawyer     in    attendance    had   a    conflict    of\n\ninterest; and the selling price was too low.              These events are said\n\nto have violated due process and equal protection, along with a\n\n\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fcollection    of   other   federal    rights.1   Without   any   further\n\nexplanation as to how he was harmed, plaintiff requests damages in\n\nthe amount of $20 million.\n\n           The district court was obviously justified in deeming\n\nthese allegations insufficient to state a claim.           Among other\n\ndeficiencies, there is no basis for inferring that state action\n\nexisted (for purposes of § 1983), that a conspiracy was involved (§\n\n1985); that some form of discrimination occurred (§ 2000a-2); that\n\nplaintiff was deprived of a protected property interest (due\n\nprocess); or that he was improperly subjected to differential\n\ntreatment (equal protection).        As the district court noted, it is\n\nimpossible to \"identify the role that any particular defendant is\n\nalleged to have played with respect to any specific cause of\n\naction.\"     For that matter, it is not even apparent how plaintiff\n\nhas been harmed, apart from an inability to attend church services\n\nat that particular location.\n\n           The court's decision to dismiss the complaint sua sponte,\n\nwithout first giving plaintiff notice and an opportunity to amend,\n\npresents a closer question.2    Such an action is \"rarely\" warranted.\n\nCepero-Rivera v. Fagundo, 414 F.3d 124, 130 (1st Cir. 2005).       \"The\n\n\n     1\n       The complaint also cites the Fifth and Thirteenth Amendments\nand 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983, 1985 & 2000a-2. Sections 1981 and 1988 are\nadded on appeal.\n     2\n       Since plaintiff was not proceeding in forma pauperis, the\ncourt was not invoking 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e) but rather its \"inherent\nauthority to manage its own docket.\"\n\n                                     -3-\n\fgeneral    rule     is   that   in   limited   circumstances,   sua   sponte\n\ndismissals of complaints under Rule 12(b)(6) ... are appropriate,\n\nbut that such dismissals are erroneous unless the parties have been\n\nafforded notice and an opportunity to amend the complaint or\n\notherwise respond.\"        Chute v. Walker, 281 F.3d 314, 319 (1st Cir.\n\n2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). To be sure, a sua sponte\n\ndismissal entered without notice or opportunity to amend \"may be\n\nproper in relatively egregious circumstances.\"          Martinez-Rivera v.\n\nSanchez Ramos, 498 F.3d 3, 7 (1st Cir. 2007). Where the allegations\n\nin the complaint, viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiff,\n\n\"are patently meritless and beyond all hope of redemption,\" i.e.,\n\nwhere it is \"crystal clear that the plaintiff cannot prevail and\n\nthat amending the complaint would be futile,\" then such a dismissal\n\nmay stand. Gonzalez-Gonzalez v. United States, 257 F.3d 31, 37 (1st\n\nCir. 2001).       \"But haste makes waste, and it will be the rare case\n\nin which a sua sponte dismissal--at least, a sua sponte dismissal\n\nwithout leave to amend--will be upheld.\"          Id.\n\n            The cases falling within this exception generally contain\n\nincurable defects that are evident from the face of the complaint--\n\ne.g.,    claims    based   on   indisputably    bogus   legal   theories   or\n\ndelusional factual scenarios. See, e.g., Martinez-Rivera, 498 F.3d\n\nat 7-9 (upholding sua sponte dismissal of three claims deemed\n\ninherently defective on legal grounds, but reversing as to two\n\nclaims     deemed        potentially     salvageable     through      factual\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fsupplementation); Wyatt v. City of Boston, 35 F.3d 13, 15 n.1 (1st\n\nCir. 1994) (per curiam) (listing examples).           The problem with the\n\ninstant complaint, however, is not what it contains but what it\n\ndoes not contain: it is utterly bare-boned and conclusory, lacking\n\nany explanation as to how defendants violated plaintiff's legal\n\nrights and caused him injury. Such a deficiency is not necessarily\n\nincurable; in theory at least, additional allegations set forth in\n\nan amended complaint could bridge the gap.             With respect to a\n\ncomplaint   of   this   nature--i.e.,    one   that    is   not   inherently\n\ndefective on its face but simply has no meat on its bones--it would\n\nseem that notice and an opportunity to amend should ordinarily\n\nprecede any sua sponte dismissal.\n\n            Yet we need not ultimately decide whether the district\n\ncourt acted precipitously here.          We would find any such error\n\nharmless, since it is clear at this point that an opportunity to\n\namend would be futile.       The chances of plaintiff producing an\n\namended complaint that stated a cognizable claim are virtually non-\n\nexistent.   Even with all allegations construed in his favor, it is\n\nwell-nigh impossible to conjure up a scenario in which the sale of\n\nthe church harmed him in a way that contravened federal law.\n\nSignificantly,    neither   in   district   court     nor   on    appeal   has\n\nplaintiff made any effort to supplement the factual allegations in\n\nhis complaint or to clarify the legal grounds for recovery; no\n\nattempt has been made, in other words, to address the shortcomings\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fidentified in the order of dismissal.    And plaintiff has a track\n\nrecord of filing meritless, often frivolous, suits.     See, e.g.,\n\nGreen v. U.S. Dep't of Labor, 1st Cir. No. 07-2355 (rejecting\n\nchallenge to level of benefits received for work injury sustained\n\n43 years earlier).    Under these circumstances, providing him with\n\nan opportunity to amend his complaint would be an empty formality.\n\nWe decline to vacate and remand for such a purposeless undertaking.\n\n          Affirmed.    The motion opposing the November 28, 2008\n\nnotice of submission is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\f",
