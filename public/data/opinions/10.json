George A. O'Toole, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                    Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                   Souter,* Associate Justice,\n                    and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     James H.

Loucks, Acting United States Attorney, on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n\n                        February 22, 2010\n\n\n\n\n*\n    The Hon. David H. Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the\nSupreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.\n\f           TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.               Defendant-appellant Marcus\n\nMitchell   was    convicted   after   a     jury    trial    for       conspiring   to\n\ndistribute cocaine.     He now appeals his conviction on two grounds.\n\nFirst, he contends that the district court improperly admitted out-\n\nof-court co-conspirator statements despite insufficient evidence to\n\ncorroborate Mitchell's participation in the conspiracy. See United\n\nStates v. Petrozziello, 548 F.2d 20 (1st Cir. 1977).                      Second, he\n\ncontends that the district court erred by failing to give a \"buyer-\n\nseller\" instruction sua sponte, which would have asked the jury to\n\nconsider whether Mitchell's relationship with the conspiracy was\n\nthat of an active member or merely a purchaser of narcotics for\n\npersonal use.      We conclude that the government offered more than\n\nsufficient extrinsic evidence to support the admission of the co-\n\nconspirator      statements   and   that    the     need    for    a    buyer-seller\n\ninstruction was not supported by the record.                We affirm.\n\n                               I. Background1\n\n           A. The Conspiracy\n\n           From January to October 2004, Manuel Pinales ran a\n\nwholesale drug operation that supplied large quantities of cocaine\n\nto customers in the Boston area.            Luis Clas, José Rodríguez, and\n\nRichard Pena were also major players.               Their customers typically\n\npurchased kilograms of cocaine at a time, often on consignment, for\n\n\n1\n    \"We review the facts of a criminal case on appeal from a\nconviction in the light most favorable to the verdict.\" United\nStates v. Candelaria-Silva, 162 F.3d 698, 700 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n                                      -2-\n\fapproximately $24,000 per kilogram.          One of their customers, who\n\npurchased wholesale quantities of cocaine, was known variously as\n\n\"Prieto\"2 or \"Marko.\"3\n\n             In January 2004, Clas asked Rodríguez to take over the\n\norganization's distribution activities while he was away in the\n\nDominican Republic.       Before he left, Clas introduced Rodríguez to\n\nmany of the organization's customers, one of whom was \"Prieto.\" At\n\nthis initial meeting, Rodríguez sold \"Prieto\" and another man a\n\nkilogram of cocaine.         While Clas was away, Rodríguez was the\n\nprincipal contact for Clas's customers.\n\n             From January through October 2004, Rodríguez delivered,\n\non   five   occasions,    large   quantities     of   cocaine   to    \"Prieto,\"\n\ntotaling    approximately    fifteen    kilograms.      \"Prieto\"      generally\n\npurchased one or two kilograms at a time, although he purchased\n\nthree kilograms on one occasion and five on another.                   \"Prieto\"\n\noften purchased on consignment and, at one point, was in debt to\n\nRodríguez to the tune of $120,000.\n\n             B. The Wiretap Investigation\n\n             From July through October 2004, the Drug Enforcement\n\nAdministration (DEA), which had been investigating Pinales's role\n\nin   the    conspiracy,   began   a    wiretap   investigation       on     phones\n\n\n2\n    The Spanish term \"Prieto\"           translates     to   \"the     dark    one.\"\nMitchell is African-American.\n3\n   As we have mentioned, Mitchell's first name is Marcus; \"Marko\"\nis a Spanish equivalent.\n\n                                      -3-\n\fbelonging to Pinales, Pena, Rodríguez, and Clas.                 Over eight\n\nhundred phone calls were intercepted.       Twenty-six are relevant to\n\nthis appeal.\n\n            There were thirteen calls involving other buyers, not\n\nMitchell.    All of these calls were in code and involved conspiracy\n\nmembers other than Mitchell discussing the purchase and sale of\n\ndrugs. Drugs were referred to as concert tickets, vehicles, or car\n\nparts.     For instance, during one recorded call, Clas arranged to\n\nmeet   a   customer   to   exchange    \"twenty   three\"    for   \"a    tire.\"\n\nSubsequent surveillance of Clas showed him distributing a kilogram\n\nof cocaine to that customer.\n\n            Seven calls (the \"Mitchell calls\") were made to, or\n\noriginated    from,   Mitchell's   listed   number.       In   these   calls,\n\nMitchell spoke directly to Clas or Rodríguez in code about drugs\n\nand drug proceeds.     For instance, in one conversation, Rodríguez\n\nsaid to Mitchell, \"my boy told me about something but it wasn't um\n\n. . . In the price range, what I was looking for . . . he set it\n\nhigh . . . if worst comes to worst, I'll just, you know, I'll just\n\ntell him to . . . give me that car . . . so I can um . . . I can\n\nhave stuff to . . . transportation.\"         In another exchange, Clas\n\nasked Mitchell, \"[C]an I see you tomorrow please.\"                    Mitchell\n\nreplied, \"[I]t's kind of early, man,\" but agreed to see him.               At\n\ntrial, these calls were offered as admissions of the defendant.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fMitchell did not object to their admission, nor does he challenge\n\nthem on appeal.\n\n           Six calls (the \"Prieto calls\") involved conversations\n\namong conspiracy members in which they discussed \"Prieto.\"     Two of\n\nthe Mitchell calls overlapped with the Prieto calls and provided\n\nstrong circumstantial evidence that Mitchell was \"Prieto.\"       For\n\nexample, during one recording, Mitchell called Rodríguez at 9:57\n\na.m. looking to speak to Clas.      At 9:58 a.m., Rodríguez called\n\nPinales and asked him to tell Clas to call \"Prieto.\"     Pinales said\n\nthat he would.    At 9:59 a.m., Clas called Mitchell.   The remaining\n\ncalls demonstrated \"Prieto's\" role in the conspiracy. For example,\n\nduring one exchange, Rodríguez told Pinales that he was going to\n\ncollect a debt from \"Prieto.\"    The next day, he told Pinales that\n\n\"Prieto\" only brought \"nineteen pesos,\" short of the full payment\n\namount.   In another call, Rodríguez asked Pinales if he could give\n\n\"Prieto\" five \"tickets\" in advance since \"Prieto\" could only afford\n\nthree.    The Prieto calls were offered at trial as co-conspirator\n\nstatements, which Mitchell now challenges in this appeal.4\n\n           C. The Jig is Up\n\n           In October 2004, government agents seized fifty-three\n\nkilograms of cocaine from Clas's residence along with drug ledgers\n\nfrom Pinales's store.     The ledgers showed numerous entries for\n\n\n4\n   The government does not dispute that the challenged statements\nwere being offered for the truth of the matters asserted.      We\nassume that they were.\n\n                                 -5-\n\f\"Marko\"/\"Prieto,\" revealing that he generally received three to\n\nfive kilograms at a time, often delivered on consignment, and that\n\nhe owed up to $ 120,000 in the summer of 2004.         Around this time,\n\nRodríguez began to cooperate with the government pursuant to a plea\n\nagreement.\n\n           On February 23, 2005, government agents showed Rodríguez\n\nan array of several photographs and asked him to identify anyone\n\nthat he knew. Rodríguez pointed to a photo of Mitchell and said,\n\n\"That's Prieto,\" although he did not know Mitchell's actual name.\n\nLater, Mitchell was arrested and, in July 2005, indicted by a grand\n\njury.    He was charged, along with thirteen co-defendants, with\n\nconspiracy to possess with intent to distribute, and distribution\n\nof, more than five kilograms of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A), and 846.\n\n           At Mitchell's jury trial, Rodríguez testified, among\n\nother things, that Pinales, Pena, Clas, and Rodríguez only referred\n\nto one customer as \"Prieto\"/\"Marko.\"         Rodríguez identified that\n\nperson as Mitchell.    The government also introduced the wiretapped\n\ncalls,   including   the   Prieto   calls   now   challenged   on   appeal.\n\nMitchell made a timely objection to the admission of the Prieto\n\ncalls under Petrozziello, 548 F.2d 20, asserting that there was\n\ninsufficient evidence, independent of the co-conspirator statements\n\nthemselves, to establish that he was \"Prieto\" and therefore a\n\n\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fmember of the conspiracy.5            The district court disagreed and\n\nadmitted the statements.       Mitchell was convicted after a four-day\n\ntrial and now appeals.\n\n                               II. Discussion\n\n            A. Admission of Co-conspirator Statements\n\n            Mitchell's heartland claim on appeal is that he was\n\nconvicted   on   the   basis    of   out-of-court   statements   that    were\n\nimproperly admitted under the co-conspirator exception to the\n\nhearsay rule.    See Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E).        He challenges the\n\nadmission of those statements, and asks us to vacate his conviction\n\nand remand for a new trial.6\n\n            Federal    Rule    of    Evidence   801(d)(2)(E)   permits   the\n\nadmission of statements made \"by a co-conspirator of a party during\n\nthe course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\"                See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Portela, 167 F.3d 687, 702 (1st Cir. 1999).              To\n\nintroduce statements under this co-conspirator exception, \"[t]he\n\nproponent of the statement bears the burden of establishing, by a\n\n\n5\n   Under Petrozziello, the party against whom a statement is being\noffered must object to its admission at the time it is offered,\nand, if the statement is admitted, renew the objection at the close\nof all the evidence. United States v. Sepúlveda, 15 F.3d 1161,\n1180 (1st Cir. 1993)(citations omitted). The court will then make\nits final Petrozziello determination \"out of the hearing of the\njury.\" United States v. Portela, 167 F.3d 687, 703 (1st Cir. 1999)\n(citing United States v. Ciampaglia, 628 F.2d 632, 638 (1st Cir.\n1980)).\n6\n   Mitchell limits his appeal to whether sufficient evidence was\npresented to establish his participation in the conspiracy. He\ndoes not contest the existence of a conspiracy to distribute drugs.\n\n                                       -7-\n\fpreponderance of the evidence, 'that a conspiracy embracing both\n\nthe declarant and the defendant existed, and that the declarant\n\nuttered   the    statement     during     and   in   furtherance    of    the\n\nconspiracy.'\"    United States v. Bradshaw, 281 F.3d 278, 283 (1st\n\nCir. 2002)(quoting Sepúlveda, 15 F.3d at 1180); see Fed. R. Evid.\n\n801(d)(2)(E).    A court's determination as to whether this burden\n\nhas been met is known in this circuit as a Petrozziello ruling.\n\nSee United States v. Famania-Roche, 537 F.3d 71, 75 (1st Cir.\n\n2008)(citing United States v. Newton, 326 F.3d 253, 257 (1st Cir.\n\n2003)).\n\n          \"[A]    co-conspirator's      statement,    standing   alone,   is\n\ninsufficient     to   meet    the   preponderance     standard     of    Rule\n\n801(d)(2)(E).\"    Sepúlveda, 15 F.3d at 1182.        The proponent of the\n\nstatement must introduce some \"extrinsic evidence . . . sufficient\n\nto delineate the conspiracy and corroborate the declarant's and the\n\ndefendant's roles in it.\"       United States v. Piper, 298 F.3d 47, 52\n\n(1st Cir. 2002).      Thus, \"[w]hile a trial court may consider the\n\ncontents of the statement at issue as evidence of the elements of\n\na Petrozziello determination, the determination must rest at least\n\nin part on corroborating evidence beyond that contained in the\n\nstatements at issue.\"        Portela, 167 F.3d at 703.     We will uphold\n\nthe trial court's admission of co-conspirator statements unless it\n\nwas clearly erroneous.        United States v. Thompson, 449 F.3d 267,\n\n273 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\f           Mitchell's principal contention is that the admission of\n\nthe   co-conspirator         statements         was    in    error       because      the\n\n\"uncorroborated\"       testimony     of    Rodríguez        laid    an   insufficient\n\nevidentiary foundation to support the conclusion that Mitchell was,\n\nmore likely than not, \"Prieto,\" a member of the conspiracy.                        This\n\nargument   is     a    nonstarter.        The     testimony        of    Rodríguez,    a\n\ncooperating witness, was extrinsic evidence that was probative of\n\nthe   existence       of   the   conspiracy       to   distribute        cocaine    and\n\nMitchell's membership in that conspiracy.                    At trial, Rodríguez\n\nidentified Mitchell as \"Prieto,\" one of his co-conspirators.                       See,\n\ne.g., Portela, 167 F.3d at 703, 704 (co-conspirator's in-court\n\nidentification of defendant as conspiracy member supports admission\n\nof co-conspirator statements).            Rodríguez testified that Mitchell\n\nregularly purchased, on consignment, multi-kilogram quantities of\n\ncocaine from conspiracy members for tens of thousands of dollars at\n\na time.    See, e.g., United States v. Moran, 984 F.2d 1299, 1303\n\n(1st Cir. 1993) (pattern of drug sales between individuals for\n\nredistribution supports conclusion that individuals were involved\n\nin drug conspiracy).         We have never held that the testimony of a\n\ncooperating witness cannot be used to satisfy the government's\n\nburden under Petrozziello.         Indeed, our cases are to the contrary.\n\nSee Piper, 298 F.3d at 52 (testimony of cooperating co-conspirator\n\n\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\fsupports admission of statements under Rule 801(d)(2)(E)); accord\n\nPortela, 167 F.3d at 703-04.7\n\n               In    any    event,        the     government       offered      substantial\n\nevidence, in addition to Rodríguez's testimony, to establish that\n\nMitchell was an active conspiracy member.                       The government offered\n\nrecordings      of    phone       calls,    which        came   into    evidence    as     the\n\ndefendant's own admissions, in which Mitchell discussed drug-\n\nrelated matters in code with other conspiracy members.                           See United\n\nStates    v.    Morales-Madera,           352     F.3d    1,    12-13   (1st     Cir.    2003)\n\n(defendant's         use    of     drug     code       probative       of    membership     in\n\nconspiracy).         Phone records showed calls from Mitchell's listed\n\nphone    number      to    Clas    and     Rodríguez,       and,   as       discussed,    call\n\npatterns and conversations among co-conspirators provided strong\n\ncircumstantial proof that Mitchell was indeed \"Prieto.\"8                                   See\n\nUnited States v. Campbell, 268 F.3d 1, 6 n.4 (1st Cir. 2001)(phone\n\nrecords and call patterns probative of conspiracy membership); see\n\n\n7\n    A defendant's conviction for participation in a narcotics\ndistribution conspiracy may be upheld under a reasonable doubt\nstandard on the basis of the \"uncorroborated\" testimony of a\ncooperating witness alone. See United States v. Gómez-Pabón, 911\nF.2d 847, 853 (1st Cir. 1990) (rejecting defendant's argument that\ncooperating witness's testimony was insufficient to establish\nparticipation in conspiracy); see also United States v. Martínez-\nMedina, 279 F.3d 105, 115 (1st Cir. 2002) (quoting United States v.\nAndújar, 49 F.3d 16, 21 (1st Cir. 1995)) (same). Plainly, then,\nthe testimony of a cooperating witness may be used to satisfy the\nlower evidentiary burden required by Petrozziello. 548 F.2d at 22,\n23.\n8\n   Mitchell does not dispute that Clas and Rodríguez were members\nof a conspiracy to distribute cocaine.\n\n                                                -10-\n\falso Portela, 167 F.3d at 703 (phone records may corroborate\n\nparticipation in conspiracy for purposes of Rule 801(d)(2)(E)).\n\n             The government also put into evidence a phone book seized\n\nfrom Clas's apartment containing Mitchell's phone number with \"El\n\nNegro\" written beside it.9            See Portela, 167 F.3d at 703 (co-\n\nconspirator        phone   book    containing    defendant's     phone        number\n\nprobative of conspiracy involvement).                 Drug records seized from\n\nClas's residence and presented at trial showed that \"Prieto\"\n\n/\"Marko\" made multiple purchases of multi-kilogram quantities of\n\ncocaine from the conspiracy on consignment.               See United States v.\n\nTejada, 886 F.2d 483, 487 (1st Cir. 1989)(drug ledger, containing\n\nnicknames of defendant and other conspiracy members, is direct\n\nevidence of membership in conspiracy); see also Martínez-Medina,\n\n279   F.3d    at    127    (drug   ledgers    may     corroborate     defendant's\n\nparticipation in drug conspiracy).\n\n             We need not gild this lily any further.             The government\n\nintroduced more than sufficient extrinsic evidence to establish\n\nthat Mitchell was, more likely than not, a member of the charged\n\nconspiracy     to     distribute    cocaine,     and     that   the    challenged\n\nstatements were in furtherance of the conspiracy's objectives. The\n\ndistrict     court    properly     admitted     the    statements     under    Rule\n\n801(d)(2)(E).\n\n\n\n9\n  \"El Negro\" and \"Prieto,\" when translated, both roughly mean \"the\ndark one.\"\n\n                                       -11-\n\f           B. Buyer-Seller Instruction\n\n           Next, Mitchell argues that, though he himself did not\n\nrequest one, the district court should have given a buyer-seller\n\ninstruction sua sponte because the evidence presented at trial\n\nsupported the theory that he was a mere buyer and not a co-\n\nconspirator.      See   Moran,    984    F.2d    at   1302.      A    buyer-seller\n\ninstruction is appropriate only if the record, when viewed in the\n\nlight   most   favorable   to    the    defendant's     theory       of   the   case,\n\nreasonably supports the conclusion that the defendant was a mere\n\npurchaser of drugs for personal use and not an active participant\n\nin the conspiracy.

He now appeals his conviction on two grounds. First, he contends that the district court improperly admitted out-of-court co-conspirator statements despite insufficient evidence to corroborate Mitchell's participation in the conspiracy. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Petrozziello,</i> 548 F.2d 20 (1st Cir.1977). Second, he contends that the district court erred by failing to give a \"buyer-seller\" instruction <i>sua sponte,</i> which would have asked the jury to consider whether Mitchell's relationship with the conspiracy was that of an active member or merely a purchaser of narcotics for personal use. We conclude that the government offered more than sufficient extrinsic evidence to support the admission of the co-conspirator statements and that the need for a buyer-seller instruction was not supported by the record. We affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i><sup>[1]</sup></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. The Conspiracy</h2>\n<p>From January to October 2004, Manuel Pinales ran a wholesale drug operation that supplied large quantities of cocaine to customers in the Boston area. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> Luis Clas, José Rodríguez, and Richard Pena were also major players. Their customers typically purchased kilograms of cocaine at a time, often on consignment, for approximately $24,000 per kilogram. One of their customers, who purchased wholesale quantities of cocaine, was known variously as \"Prieto\"<sup>[2]</sup> or \"Marko.\"<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>In January 2004, Clas asked Rodríguez to take over the organization's distribution activities while he was away in the Dominican Republic. Before he left, Clas introduced Rodríguez to many of the organization's customers, one of whom was \"Prieto.\" At this initial meeting, Rodríguez sold \"Prieto\" and another man a kilogram of cocaine. While Clas was away, Rodríguez was the principal contact for Clas's customers.</p>\n<p>From January through October 2004, Rodríguez delivered, on five occasions, large quantities of cocaine to \"Prieto,\" totaling approximately fifteen kilograms. \"Prieto\" generally purchased one or two kilograms at a time, although he purchased three kilograms on one occasion and five on another. \"Prieto\" often purchased on consignment and, at one point, was in debt to Rodríguez to the tune of $120,000.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. The Wiretap Investigation</h2>\n<p>From July through October 2004, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), which had been investigating Pinales's role in the conspiracy, began a wiretap investigation on phones belonging to Pinales, Pena, Rodríguez, and Clas. Over eight hundred phone calls were intercepted. Twenty-six are relevant to this appeal.</p>\n<p>There were thirteen calls involving other buyers, not Mitchell. All of these calls were in code and involved conspiracy members other than Mitchell discussing the purchase and sale of drugs. Drugs were referred to as concert tickets, vehicles, or car parts. For instance, during one recorded call, Clas arranged to meet a customer to exchange \"twenty three\" for \"a tire.\" Subsequent surveillance of Clas showed him distributing a kilogram of cocaine to that customer.</p>\n<p>Seven calls (the \"Mitchell calls\") were made to, or originated from, Mitchell's listed number. In these calls, Mitchell spoke directly to Clas or Rodríguez in code about drugs and drug proceeds. For instance, in one conversation, Rodríguez said to Mitchell, \"my boy told me about something but it wasn't um ... In the price range, what I was looking for ... he set it high ... if worst comes to worst, I'll just, you know, I'll just tell him to ... give me that car... so I can um ... I can have stuff to ... transportation.\" In another exchange, Clas asked Mitchell, \"[C]an I see you tomorrow please.\" Mitchell replied, \"[I]t's kind of early, man,\" but agreed to see him. At trial, these calls were offered as admissions of the defendant. Mitchell did not object to their admission, nor does he challenge them on appeal.</p>\n<p>Six calls (the \"Prieto calls\") involved conversations among conspiracy members in which they discussed \"Prieto.\" Two of the Mitchell calls overlapped with the Prieto calls and provided strong circumstantial evidence that Mitchell was \"Prieto.\" For example, during one recording, Mitchell called Rodríguez at 9:57 a.m. looking to speak to Clas. At 9:58 a.m., Rodríguez called Pinales and asked him to tell Clas to call \"Prieto.\" Pinales said that he would. At 9:59 a.m., Clas called Mitchell. The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> remaining calls demonstrated \"Prieto's\" role in the conspiracy. For example, during one exchange, Rodríguez told Pinales that he was going to collect a debt from \"Prieto.\" The next day, he told Pinales that \"Prieto\" only brought \"nineteen pesos,\" short of the full payment amount. In another call, Rodríguez asked Pinales if he could give \"Prieto\" five \"tickets\" in advance since \"Prieto\" could only afford three. The Prieto calls were offered at trial as co-conspirator statements, which Mitchell now challenges in this appeal.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. The Jig is Up</h2>\n<p>In October 2004, government agents seized fifty-three kilograms of cocaine from Clas's residence along with drug ledgers from Pinales's store. The ledgers showed numerous entries for \"Marko\"/\"Prieto,\" revealing that he generally received three to five kilograms at a time, often delivered on consignment, and that he owed up to $ 120,000 in the summer of 2004. Around this time, Rodríguez began to cooperate with the government pursuant to a plea agreement.</p>\n<p>On February 23, 2005, government agents showed Rodríguez an array of several photographs and asked him to identify anyone that he knew. Rodríguez pointed to a photo of Mitchell and said, \"That's Prieto,\" although he did not know Mitchell's actual name. Later, Mitchell was arrested and, in July 2005, indicted by a grand jury. He was charged, along with thirteen co-defendants, with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute, and distribution of, more than five kilograms of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A), and 846.</p>\n<p>At Mitchell's jury trial, Rodríguez testified, among other things, that Pinales, Pena, Clas, and Rodríguez only referred to one customer as \"Prieto\"/\"Marko.\" Rodríguez identified that person as Mitchell. The government also introduced the wiretapped calls, including the Prieto calls now challenged on appeal. Mitchell made a timely objection to the admission of the Prieto calls under <i>Petrozziello,</i> 548 F.2d 20, asserting that there was insufficient evidence, independent of the co-conspirator statements themselves, to establish that he was \"Prieto\" and therefore a member of the conspiracy.<sup>[5]</sup> The district court disagreed and admitted the statements. Mitchell was convicted after a four-day trial and now appeals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Admission of Co-conspirator Statements</h2>\n<p>Mitchell's heartland claim on appeal is that he was convicted on the basis of out-of-court statements that were improperly admitted under the co-conspirator exception to the hearsay rule. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). He challenges the admission of those statements, and asks us to vacate his conviction and remand for a new trial.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(E) permits the admission of statements made \"by a co-conspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\" <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Portela,</i> 167 F.3d 687, 702 (1st Cir.1999). To introduce statements under this co-conspirator exception, \"[t]he proponent of the statement bears the burden of establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, `that a conspiracy embracing both the declarant and the defendant existed, and that the declarant uttered the statement during and in furtherance of the conspiracy.'\" <i>United States v. Bradshaw,</i> 281 F.3d 278, 283 (1st Cir.2002)(quoting <i>Sepúlveda,</i> 15 F.3d at 1180); <i>see</i> Fed. R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). A court's determination as to whether this burden has been met is known in this circuit as a <i>Petrozziello</i> ruling. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Famania-Roche,</i> 537 F.3d 71, 75 (1st Cir.2008)(citing <i>United States v. Newton,</i> 326 F.3d 253, 257 (1st Cir.2003)).</p>\n<p>\"[A] co-conspirator's statement, standing alone, is insufficient to meet the preponderance standard of Rule 801(d)(2)(E).\" <i>Sepúlveda,</i> 15 F.3d at 1182. The proponent of the statement must introduce some \"extrinsic evidence... sufficient to delineate the conspiracy and corroborate the declarant's and the defendant's roles in it.\" <i>United States v. Piper,</i> 298 F.3d 47, 52 (1st Cir.2002). Thus, \"[w]hile a trial court may consider the contents of the statement at issue as evidence of the elements of a <i>Petrozziello</i> determination, the determination must rest at least in part on corroborating evidence beyond that contained in the statements at issue.\" <i>Portela,</i> 167 F.3d at 703. We will uphold the trial court's admission of co-conspirator statements unless it was clearly erroneous. <i>United States v. Thompson,</i> 449 F.3d 267, 273 (1st Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p>Mitchell's principal contention is that the admission of the co-conspirator statements was in error because the \"uncorroborated\" testimony of Rodríguez laid an insufficient evidentiary foundation to support the conclusion that Mitchell was, more likely than not, \"Prieto,\" a member of the conspiracy. This argument is a nonstarter. The testimony of Rodríguez, a cooperating witness, was extrinsic evidence that was probative of the existence of the conspiracy to distribute cocaine and Mitchell's membership in that conspiracy. At trial, Rodríguez identified Mitchell as \"Prieto,\" one of his co-conspirators. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Portela,</i> 167 F.3d at 703, 704 (co-conspirator's in-court identification of defendant as conspiracy member supports admission of co-conspirator statements). Rodríguez testified that Mitchell regularly purchased, on consignment, multi-kilogram quantities of cocaine from conspiracy members for tens of thousands of dollars at a time. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Moran,</i> 984 F.2d 1299, 1303 (1st Cir.1993) (pattern of drug sales between individuals for redistribution supports conclusion that individuals were involved in drug conspiracy). We have never held that the testimony of a cooperating witness cannot be used to satisfy the government's burden under <i>Petrozziello.</i> Indeed, our cases are to the contrary. <i>See </i><i>Piper,</i> 298 F.3d at 52 (testimony of cooperating co-conspirator supports admission of statements under Rule 801(d)(2)(E)); <i>accord </i><i>Portela,</i> 167 F.3d at 703-04.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> In any event, the government offered substantial evidence, in addition to Rodríguez's testimony, to establish that Mitchell was an active conspiracy member. The government offered recordings of phone calls, which came into evidence as the defendant's own admissions, in which Mitchell discussed drug-related matters in code with other conspiracy members. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Morales-Madera,</i> 352 F.3d 1, 12-13 (1st Cir.2003) (defendant's use of drug code probative of membership in conspiracy). Phone records showed calls from Mitchell's listed phone number to Clas and Rodríguez, and, as discussed, call patterns and conversations among coconspirators provided strong circumstantial proof that Mitchell was indeed \"Prieto.\"<sup>[8]</sup><i>See </i><i>United States v. Campbell,</i> 268 F.3d 1, 6 n. 4 (1st Cir.2001)(phone records and call patterns probative of conspiracy membership); <i>see also </i><i>Portela,</i> 167 F.3d at 703 (phone records may corroborate participation in conspiracy for purposes of Rule 801(d)(2)(E)).</p>\n<p>The government also put into evidence a phone book seized from Clas's apartment containing Mitchell's phone number with \"El Negro\" written beside it.<sup>[9]</sup><i>See </i><i>Portela,</i> 167 F.3d at 703 (co-conspirator phone book containing defendant's phone number probative of conspiracy involvement). Drug records seized from Clas's residence and presented at trial showed that \"Prieto\"/\"Marko\" made multiple purchases of multi-kilogram quantities of cocaine from the conspiracy on consignment. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Tejada,</i> 886 F.2d 483, 487 (1st Cir.1989)(drug ledger, containing nicknames of defendant and other conspiracy members, is direct evidence of membership in conspiracy); <i>see also </i><i>Martínez-Medina,</i> 279 F.3d at 127 (drug ledgers may corroborate defendant's participation in drug conspiracy).</p>\n<p>We need not gild this lily any further. The government introduced more than sufficient extrinsic evidence to establish that Mitchell was, more likely than not, a member of the charged conspiracy to distribute cocaine, and that the challenged statements were in furtherance of the conspiracy's objectives. The district court properly admitted the statements under Rule 801(d)(2)(E).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Buyer-Seller Instruction</h2>\n<p>Next, Mitchell argues that, though he himself did not request one, the district court should have given a buyer-seller instruction <i>sua sponte</i> because the evidence presented at trial supported the theory that he was a mere buyer and not a coconspirator. <i>See </i><i>Moran,</i> 984 F.2d at 1302. A buyer-seller instruction is appropriate only if the record, when viewed in the light most favorable to the defendant's theory of the case, reasonably supports the conclusion that the defendant was a mere purchaser of drugs for personal use and not an active participant in the conspiracy. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Rodríguez,</i> 858 F.2d 809, 812 (1st Cir.1988). A \"classic\" buyer-seller relationship is a single sale, for personal use, without prearrangement. <i>Moran,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> 984 F.2d at 1304; <i>United States v. Innamorati,</i> 996 F.2d 456, 484 (1st Cir.1993)(buyer-seller instruction restricted to cases \"in which the evidence showed only a single or a very limited number of sales for personal use\").</p>\n<p>We review the district court's failure to issue the instruction <i>sua sponte</i> for plain error, <i>United States v. Varoudakis,</i> 233 F.3d 113, 125 n. 12 (1st Cir.2000), bearing in mind that \"the plain error exception is cold comfort to most defendants pursuing claims of instructional error.\" <i>United States v. Gómez,</i> 255 F.3d 31, 37 (1st Cir.2001). To succeed, the defendant must show \"(1) that an error occurred, (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Duarte,</i> 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n<p>We hold that the district court did not plainly err in failing to give a buyer-seller instruction because the record does not support the theory that Mitchell was a mere buyer for personal use. At the outset, Mitchell never argued to the jury that he was a mere buyer; his principal defense was that he was not \"Prieto.\" <i>See </i><i>United States v. Askew,</i> 403 F.3d 496, 504 (7th Cir.2005) (defendant's \"choice not to adopt a buyer-seller defense cuts in favor of finding no error in the district judge's decision not to give the instruction\"); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Johnson,</i> 437 F.3d 665, 677 (7th Cir.2006)(similar).</p>\n<p>In any event, the evidence at trial showed that Mitchell was involved in multiple transactions, for large, kilogram-quantities of cocaine, for large sums of money. <i>See Martínez-Medina,</i> 279 F.3d at 120 (no buyer-seller relationship where defendant made repeated purchases of large quantities of drugs for resale); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Gómes,</i> 376 F.3d 42, 45 (1st Cir.2004)(even one sale between two parties can prove existence of conspiracy when coupled with supporting contextual details). The evidence established that he often received drugs on consignment. <i>United States v. Humphrey,</i> 287 F.3d 422, 435 (6th Cir.2002) (delayed credit plan evidences trust and supports a conspiracy link between parties). He also made pre-arranged purchases from other conspiracy members. <i>United States v. Hawkins,</i> 547 F.3d 66, 72 (2d Cir. 2008)(pre-arrangement to deal in wholesale quantities of drugs creates presumption of knowing conspiracy involvement). Moreover, he was familiar with the conspiracy's drug code. <i>Morales-Madera,</i> 352 F.3d at 12-13 (defendant's use of drug code probative of his role in conspiracy). Under these circumstances, a buyer-seller instruction was not called for. There was no errorlet alone plain errorwhen the district court did not so instruct the jury.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Hon. David H. Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the Supreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  \"We review the facts of a criminal case on appeal from a conviction in the light most favorable to the verdict.\" <i>United States v. Candelaria-Silva,</i> 162 F.3d 698, 700 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p>[2]  The Spanish term \"Prieto\" translates to \"the dark one.\" Mitchell is African-American.</p>\n<p>[3]  As we have mentioned, Mitchell's first name is Marcus; \"Marko\" is a Spanish equivalent.</p>\n<p>[4]  The government does not dispute that the challenged statements were being offered for the truth of the matters asserted. We assume that they were.</p>\n<p>[5]  Under <i>Petrozziello,</i> the party against whom a statement is being offered must object to its admission at the time it is offered, and, if the statement is admitted, renew the objection at the close of all the evidence. <i>United States v. Sepúlveda,</i> 15 F.3d 1161, 1180 (1st Cir.1993) (citations omitted). The court will then make its final <i>Petrozziello</i> determination \"out of the hearing of the jury.\" <i>United States v.

Ciampaglia,</i> 628 F.2d 632, 638 (1st Cir.1980)).</p>\n<p>[6]  Mitchell limits his appeal to whether sufficient evidence was presented to establish his participation in the conspiracy. He does not contest the existence of a conspiracy to distribute drugs.</p>\n<p>[7]  A defendant's conviction for participation in a narcotics distribution conspiracy may be upheld under a reasonable doubt standard on the basis of the \"uncorroborated\" testimony of a cooperating witness alone. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Gómez-Pabón,</i> 911 F.2d 847, 853 (1st Cir.1990) (rejecting defendant's argument that cooperating witness's testimony was insufficient to establish participation in conspiracy); <i>see also </i><i>United States v.

Plainly, then, the testimony of a cooperating witness may be used to satisfy the lower evidentiary burden required by <i>Petrozziello.</i> 548 F.2d at 22, 23.</p>\n<p>[8]  Mitchell does not dispute that Clas and Rodríguez were members of a conspiracy to distribute cocaine.</p>\n<p>[9]  \"El Negro\" and \"Prieto,\" when translated, both roughly mean \"the dark one.\"</p>\n\n</div>",

He now appeals his conviction on two grounds. First, he contends that the district court improperly admitted out-of-court co-conspirator statements despite insufficient evidence to corroborate Mitchell's participation in the conspiracy. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Petrozziello,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"342283\"><a href=\"/opinion/342283/united-states-v-ralph-petrozziello/\"><span class=\"volume\">548</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1977).

We affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i><sup>[1]</sup></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. The Conspiracy</h2>\n<p>From January to October 2004, Manuel Pinales ran a wholesale drug operation that supplied large quantities of cocaine to customers in the Boston area. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> Luis Clas, José Rodríguez, and Richard Pena were also major players.

The Wiretap Investigation</h2>\n<p>From July through October 2004, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), which had been investigating Pinales's role in the conspiracy, began a wiretap investigation on phones belonging to Pinales, Pena, Rodríguez, and Clas. Over eight hundred phone calls were intercepted. Twenty-six are relevant to this appeal.</p>\n<p>There were thirteen calls involving other buyers, not Mitchell. All of these calls were in code and involved conspiracy members other than Mitchell discussing the purchase and sale of drugs. Drugs were referred to as concert tickets, vehicles, or car parts. For instance, during one recorded call, Clas arranged to meet a customer to exchange \"twenty three\" for \"a tire.\" Subsequent surveillance of Clas showed him distributing a kilogram of cocaine to that customer.</p>\n<p>Seven calls (the \"Mitchell calls\") were made to, or originated from, Mitchell's listed number. In these calls, Mitchell spoke directly to Clas or Rodríguez in code about drugs and drug proceeds. For instance, in one conversation, Rodríguez said to Mitchell, \"my boy told me about something but it wasn't um ... In the price range, what I was looking for ... he set it high ... if worst comes to worst, I'll just, you know, I'll just tell him to ... give me that car... so I can um ... I can have stuff to ... transportation.\" In another exchange, Clas asked Mitchell, \"[C]an I see you tomorrow please.\" Mitchell replied, \"[I]t's kind of early, man,\" but agreed to see him. At trial, these calls were offered as admissions of the defendant. Mitchell did not object to their admission, nor does he challenge them on appeal.</p>\n<p>Six calls (the \"Prieto calls\") involved conversations among conspiracy members in which they discussed \"Prieto.\" Two of the Mitchell calls overlapped with the Prieto calls and provided strong circumstantial evidence that Mitchell was \"Prieto.\" For example, during one recording, Mitchell called Rodríguez at 9:57 a.m. looking to speak to Clas. At 9:58 a.m., Rodríguez called Pinales and asked him to tell Clas to call \"Prieto.\" Pinales said that he would. At 9:59 a.m., Clas called Mitchell. The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> remaining calls demonstrated \"Prieto's\" role in the conspiracy. For example, during one exchange, Rodríguez told Pinales that he was going to collect a debt from \"Prieto.\" The next day, he told Pinales that \"Prieto\" only brought \"nineteen pesos,\" short of the full payment amount. In another call, Rodríguez asked Pinales if he could give \"Prieto\" five \"tickets\" in advance since \"Prieto\" could only afford three. The Prieto calls were offered at trial as co-conspirator statements, which Mitchell now challenges in this appeal.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. The Jig is Up</h2>\n<p>In October 2004, government agents seized fifty-three kilograms of cocaine from Clas's residence along with drug ledgers from Pinales's store. The ledgers showed numerous entries for \"Marko\"/\"Prieto,\" revealing that he generally received three to five kilograms at a time, often delivered on consignment, and that he owed up to $ 120,000 in the summer of 2004. Around this time, Rodríguez began to cooperate with the government pursuant to a plea agreement.</p>\n<p>On February 23, 2005, government agents showed Rodríguez an array of several photographs and asked him to identify anyone that he knew. Rodríguez pointed to a photo of Mitchell and said, \"That's Prieto,\" although he did not know Mitchell's actual name. Later, Mitchell was arrested and, in July 2005, indicted by a grand jury. He was charged, along with thirteen co-defendants, with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute, and distribution of, more than five kilograms of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A), and 846.</p>\n<p>At Mitchell's jury trial, Rodríguez testified, among other things, that Pinales, Pena, Clas, and Rodríguez only referred to one customer as \"Prieto\"/\"Marko.\" Rodríguez identified that person as Mitchell. The government also introduced the wiretapped calls, including the Prieto calls now challenged on appeal. Mitchell made a timely objection to the admission of the Prieto calls under <i>Petrozziello,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"342283\"><a href=\"/opinion/342283/united-states-v-ralph-petrozziello/\"><span class=\"volume\">548</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, asserting that there was insufficient evidence, independent of the co-conspirator statements themselves, to establish that he was \"Prieto\" and therefore a member of the conspiracy.<sup>[5]</sup> The district court disagreed and admitted the statements. Mitchell was convicted after a four-day trial and now appeals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Admission of Co-conspirator Statements</h2>\n<p>Mitchell's heartland claim on appeal is that he was convicted on the basis of out-of-court statements that were improperly admitted under the co-conspirator exception to the hearsay rule. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). He challenges the admission of those statements, and asks us to vacate his conviction and remand for a new trial.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(E) permits the admission of statements made \"by a co-conspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\" <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Portela,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"761694\"><a href=\"/opinion/761694/united-states-v-rafael-portela-united-states-of-america-v-francisco/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">687</span></a></span>, 702 (1st Cir.1999). To introduce statements under this co-conspirator exception, \"[t]he proponent of the statement bears the burden of establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, `that a conspiracy embracing both the declarant and the defendant existed, and that the declarant uttered the statement during and in furtherance of the conspiracy.'\" <i>United States v. Bradshaw,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199842\"><a href=\"/opinion/199842/united-states-v-bradshaw/\"><span class=\"volume\">281</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">278</span></a></span>, 283 (1st Cir.2002)(quoting <i>Sepúlveda,</i> 15 F.3d at 1180); <i>see</i> Fed. R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). A court's determination as to whether this burden has been met is known in this circuit as a <i>Petrozziello</i> ruling. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Famania-Roche,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203433\"><a href=\"/opinion/203433/united-states-v-famania-roche/\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span>, 75 (1st Cir.2008)(citing <i>United States v. Newton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781617\"><a href=\"/opinion/781617/united-states-v-luis-rivera-newton/\"><span class=\"volume\">326</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">253</span></a></span>, 257 (1st Cir.2003)).</p>\n<p>\"[A] co-conspirator's statement, standing alone, is insufficient to meet the preponderance standard of Rule 801(d)(2)(E).\" <i>Sepúlveda,</i> 15 F.3d at 1182. The proponent of the statement must introduce some \"extrinsic evidence... sufficient to delineate the conspiracy and corroborate the declarant's and the defendant's roles in it.\" <i>United States v. Piper,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200046\"><a href=\"/opinion/200046/united-states-v-piper/\"><span class=\"volume\">298</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span>, 52 (1st Cir.2002). Thus, \"[w]hile a trial court may consider the contents of the statement at issue as evidence of the elements of a <i>Petrozziello</i> determination, the determination must rest at least in part on corroborating evidence beyond that contained in the statements at issue.\" <i>Portela,</i> 167 F.3d at 703. We will uphold the trial court's admission of co-conspirator statements unless it was clearly erroneous. <i>United States v. Thompson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202248\"><a href=\"/opinion/202248/united-states-v-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span></a></span>, 273 (1st Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p>Mitchell's principal contention is that the admission of the co-conspirator statements was in error because the \"uncorroborated\" testimony of Rodríguez laid an insufficient evidentiary foundation to support the conclusion that Mitchell was, more likely than not, \"Prieto,\" a member of the conspiracy. This argument is a nonstarter. The testimony of Rodríguez, a cooperating witness, was extrinsic evidence that was probative of the existence of the conspiracy to distribute cocaine and Mitchell's membership in that conspiracy. At trial, Rodríguez identified Mitchell as \"Prieto,\" one of his co-conspirators. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Portela,</i> 167 F.3d at 703, 704 (co-conspirator's in-court identification of defendant as conspiracy member supports admission of co-conspirator statements). Rodríguez testified that Mitchell regularly purchased, on consignment, multi-kilogram quantities of cocaine from conspiracy members for tens of thousands of dollars at a time. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Moran,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599257\"><a href=\"/opinion/599257/united-states-v-george-a-moran/\"><span class=\"volume\">984</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1299</span></a></span>, 1303 (1st Cir.1993) (pattern of drug sales between individuals for redistribution supports conclusion that individuals were involved in drug conspiracy). We have never held that the testimony of a cooperating witness cannot be used to satisfy the government's burden under <i>Petrozziello.</i> Indeed, our cases are to the contrary. <i>See </i><i>Piper,</i> 298 F.3d at 52 (testimony of cooperating co-conspirator supports admission of statements under Rule 801(d)(2)(E)); <i>accord </i><i>Portela,</i> 167 F.3d at 703-04.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> In any event, the government offered substantial evidence, in addition to Rodríguez's testimony, to establish that Mitchell was an active conspiracy member. The government offered recordings of phone calls, which came into evidence as the defendant's own admissions, in which Mitchell discussed drug-related matters in code with other conspiracy members. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Morales-Madera,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 12-13 (1st Cir.2003) (defendant's use of drug code probative of membership in conspiracy). Phone records showed calls from Mitchell's listed phone number to Clas and Rodríguez, and, as discussed, call patterns and conversations among coconspirators provided strong circumstantial proof that Mitchell was indeed \"Prieto.\"<sup>[8]</sup><i>See </i><i>United States v. Campbell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199629\"><a href=\"/opinion/199629/united-states-v-campbell/\"><span class=\"volume\">268</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 6 n. 4 (1st Cir.2001)(phone records and call patterns probative of conspiracy membership); <i>see also </i><i>Portela,</i> 167 F.3d at 703 (phone records may corroborate participation in conspiracy for purposes of Rule 801(d)(2)(E)).</p>\n<p>The government also put into evidence a phone book seized from Clas's apartment containing Mitchell's phone number with \"El Negro\" written beside it.<sup>[9]</sup><i>See </i><i>Portela,</i> 167 F.3d at 703 (co-conspirator phone book containing defendant's phone number probative of conspiracy involvement). Drug records seized from Clas's residence and presented at trial showed that \"Prieto\"/\"Marko\" made multiple purchases of multi-kilogram quantities of cocaine from the conspiracy on consignment. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Tejada,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"529942\"><a href=\"/opinion/529942/united-states-v-alberto-tejada-united-states-of-america-v-juan-ignacio/\"><span class=\"volume\">886</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span>, 487 (1st Cir.1989)(drug ledger, containing nicknames of defendant and other conspiracy members, is direct evidence of membership in conspiracy); <i>see also </i><i>Martínez-Medina,</i> 279 F.3d at 127 (drug ledgers may corroborate defendant's participation in drug conspiracy).</p>\n<p>We need not gild this lily any further. The government introduced more than sufficient extrinsic evidence to establish that Mitchell was, more likely than not, a member of the charged conspiracy to distribute cocaine, and that the challenged statements were in furtherance of the conspiracy's objectives. The district court properly admitted the statements under Rule 801(d)(2)(E).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Buyer-Seller Instruction</h2>\n<p>Next, Mitchell argues that, though he himself did not request one, the district court should have given a buyer-seller instruction <i>sua sponte</i> because the evidence presented at trial supported the theory that he was a mere buyer and not a coconspirator. <i>See </i><i>Moran,</i> 984 F.2d at 1302. A buyer-seller instruction is appropriate only if the record, when viewed in the light most favorable to the defendant's theory of the case, reasonably supports the conclusion that the defendant was a mere purchaser of drugs for personal use and not an active participant in the conspiracy. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Rodríguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"512578\"><a href=\"/opinion/512578/united-states-v-felix-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">858</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">809</span></a></span>, 812 (1st Cir.1988). A \"classic\" buyer-seller relationship is a single sale, for personal use, without prearrangement. <i>Moran,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> 984 F.2d at 1304; <i>United States v. Innamorati,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"609734\"><a href=\"/opinion/609734/united-states-v-kenneth-innamorati-united-states-v-william-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">456</span></a></span>, 484 (1st Cir.1993)(buyer-seller instruction restricted to cases \"in which the evidence showed only a single or a very limited number of sales for personal use\").</p>\n<p>We review the district court's failure to issue the instruction <i>sua sponte</i> for plain error, <i>United States v. Varoudakis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199172\"><a href=\"/opinion/199172/united-states-v-varoudakis/\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">113</span></a></span>, 125 n. 12 (1st Cir.2000), bearing in mind that \"the plain error exception is cold comfort to most defendants pursuing claims of instructional error.\" <i>United States v. Gómez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199484\"><a href=\"/opinion/199484/united-states-v-gomez/\"><span class=\"volume\">255</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span>, 37 (1st Cir.2001). To succeed, the defendant must show \"(1) that an error occurred, (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Duarte,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199375\"><a href=\"/opinion/199375/united-states-v-duarte/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 60 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n<p>We hold that the district court did not plainly err in failing to give a buyer-seller instruction because the record does not support the theory that Mitchell was a mere buyer for personal use. At the outset, Mitchell never argued to the jury that he was a mere buyer; his principal defense was that he was not \"Prieto.\" <i>See </i><i>United States v. Askew,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789790\"><a href=\"/opinion/789790/united-states-v-ulice-askew/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">496</span></a></span>, 504 (7th Cir.2005) (defendant's \"choice not to adopt a buyer-seller defense cuts in favor of finding no error in the district judge's decision not to give the instruction\"); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Johnson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793293\"><a href=\"/opinion/793293/united-states-v-femi-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">437</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">665</span></a></span>, 677 (7th Cir.2006)(similar).</p>\n<p>In any event, the evidence at trial showed that Mitchell was involved in multiple transactions, for large, kilogram-quantities of cocaine, for large sums of money. <i>See Martínez-Medina,</i> 279 F.3d at 120 (no buyer-seller relationship where defendant made repeated purchases of large quantities of drugs for resale); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Gómes,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201145\"><a href=\"/opinion/201145/united-states-v-gomes/\"><span class=\"volume\">376</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></a></span>, 45 (1st Cir.2004)(even one sale between two parties can prove existence of conspiracy when coupled with supporting contextual details). The evidence established that he often received drugs on consignment. <i>United States v. Humphrey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777336\"><a href=\"/opinion/777336/united-states-v-montel-lavelle-humphrey/\"><span class=\"volume\">287</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">422</span></a></span>, 435 (6th Cir.2002) (delayed credit plan evidences trust and supports a conspiracy link between parties). He also made pre-arranged purchases from other conspiracy members. <i>United States v. Hawkins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1225840\"><a href=\"/opinion/1225840/united-states-v-hawkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">66</span></a></span>, 72 (2d Cir. 2008)(pre-arrangement to deal in wholesale quantities of drugs creates presumption of knowing conspiracy involvement). Moreover, he was familiar with the conspiracy's drug code. <i>Morales-Madera,</i> 352 F.3d at 12-13 (defendant's use of drug code probative of his role in conspiracy). Under these circumstances, a buyer-seller instruction was not called for. There was no errorlet alone plain errorwhen the district court did not so instruct the jury.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Hon. David H.
