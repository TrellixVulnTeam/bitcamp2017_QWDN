This cases raises, among\n\nother issues, the knotty question of how far the Rehabilitation Act\n\nof 1973 (\"Rehabilitation Act\"), 29 U.S.C. § 701 et seq., requires\n\nan employer to go to accommodate an employee whose disability –\n\nclinically diagnosed major depression – has affected, in some\n\nrespects, her ability to function in the workplace.                     The trial\n\njudge,    grappling    with   claims    under    several       statutes,   granted\n\nsummary judgment for defendants on all the plaintiff's causes of\n\naction.    Because we find that the record, viewed in the light most\n\nfavorable   to   the   appellant,      might    support    a    claim   under   the\n\nRehabilitation    Act,   and   (equally        importantly)      that   appellees'\n\ncounsel has entirely failed to address either the facts or the law\n\nbuttressing this claim, we are constrained to reverse and remand\n\nfor further proceedings.\n\n                         I. Procedural Background\n\n            A brief review of the procedural history of this case\n\nwill serve to put the issues in context.\n\n            After pursuing administrative remedies starting in 1998,\n\nplaintiff-appellant, Sylvia I. Calero-Cerezo (\"Calero\"), an attorney\n\nemployed by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\")\n\nproceeding pro se, filed her complaint in the United States District\n\nCourt on October 4, 1999. The defendants were the United States\n\nDepartment of Justice (\"DOJ\"), the INS, then-Attorney General Janet\n\nReno, and then-Commissioner of the INS Doris Meissner.                     Amended\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fcomplaints followed in May 2000 and May 2002.             Perhaps because\n\nplaintiff was representing herself, the precise causes of action\n\nwere rather hard to discern from the pleadings.            Plaintiff now\n\nasserts that, while she may have included additional theories in her\n\nadministrative proceedings, her complaint and amended complaints as\n\nsubmitted to the district court were intended to encompass only two\n\nclaims: (1) a claim for failure to accommodate her disability under\n\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et\n\nseq.,1 and the Rehabilitation Act, and (2) a claim for retaliation\n\nunder Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq.\n\n            Eventually the parties filed cross-motions for summary\n\njudgment, and on September 18, 2002, the district court issued its\n\nopinion granting the defendants' motion and denying the plaintiff's.\n\nIn   his   memorandum,   the   district   court   judge   conscientiously\n\naddressed all causes of action that might reasonably have been\n\ninferred from the plaintiff's less than artfully drafted pleadings,\n\nincluding claims for discrimination based on gender, national origin\n\nand age, which the plaintiff has not pursued, as well as the claims\n\nfor failure to accommodate and for retaliation, which the plaintiff\n\n\n\n      1\n        This opinion will concentrate almost entirely on the\nRehabilitation Act, since the ADA is not available to federal\nemployees. Rivera v. Hayman, 157 F.3d 101, 103 (2d Cir. 1998).\nThe same standards, however, apply to claims under the ADA and\nunder the Rehabilitation Act. Oliveras-Sifre v. Puerto Rico Dep't\nof Health, 214 F.3d 23, 25 n.2 (1st Cir. 2000). The elimination of\nthe ADA claim does not, therefore, affect the legal analysis or the\nscope of remedy available to the plaintiff.\n\n                                   -3-\n\fhas continued to press on this appeal.     Specifically, with regard\n\nto plaintiff's claim for failure to accommodate her disability, the\n\ndistrict court suggested, first, that \"depression per se\" is not\n\na recognized disability, then went on to conclude that, in any\n\nevent, the record conclusively indicated that plaintiff could not\n\nperform the legitimate requirements of her position, and moreover\n\nthat plaintiff's requested accommodation was not feasible.\n\n          On November 15, 2002, Calero filed her Notice of Appeal,\n\nchallenging only the district court's rulings regarding her claims\n\nfor failure to accommodate and for retaliation. Despite clear\n\nnotification of the scope of this appeal, and further confirmation\n\nin the appellant's brief, appellees'       counsel has inexplicably\n\ntreated this appeal as though it involved merely a garden variety\n\nclaim of discrimination under Title VII.   No significant discussion\n\nwhatever addresses Calero's claim – the heart of her case – that the\n\ndefendants failed to make any reasonable effort to accommodate her\n\ndisability.   This neglect has played a substantial part in the\n\ncourt's decision to remand.\n\n                      II.    Factual Background\n\n          We recount the facts in the light most favorable to\n\nCalero, the party opposing summary judgment. Motorsport Eng'g, Inc.\n\nv. Maserati SPA, 316 F.3d 26, 28 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n          Calero began practicing law in 1977 in Puerto Rico's\n\nDepartment of Justice.      Later, she worked for private firms and\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fagencies in Puerto Rico, and, from 1993 to 1995, in East Hartford,\n\nConnecticut with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.      In\n\n1995, Calero was hired as an assistant district counsel in the New\n\nYork District Office of the INS' Office of the General Counsel\n\n(\"OGC\").   Her performance was rated \"excellent\" in her 1996-97\n\nappraisal, and in May 1997 Calero successfully petitioned for a\n\ntransfer to the San Juan District Office of the OGC, where she began\n\nworking part-time as an assistant district counsel.   Nothing in the\n\nrecord suggests that Calero, up to this point in her twenty-year\n\ncareer as an attorney, had ever encountered significant difficulties\n\nin performing her job at or above the level of her employers'\n\nexpectations.\n\n           During the summer of 1997, Calero began to suffer from\n\ntension headaches and lethargy, the first sign of the onset of a\n\ndisability that was soon to erode her capacity to function without\n\naccommodation. On January 16, 1998, Dr. Roberto Rodriguez (\"Dr.\n\nRodriguez\") diagnosed Calero with a recurrence of depression and\n\nprescribed the antidepressant Paxil. Calero had suffered previously\n\nfrom depression, in 1990 when her mother and father died and again\n\nin 1992 upon the death of her brother. The record does not suggest,\n\nhowever, that at these earlier times her depression interfered with\n\nher capacity to work.\n\n           In February 1998, Calero began working full-time at the\n\nSan Juan District Office. One month later, and two months following\n\n\n                                -5-\n\fher diagnosis of depression, Calero's emotional fragility catapulted\n\nher into the first of a series of acrimonious episodes with her\n\nsupervisor Vivian Reyes-Lopez (\"Reyes\"). Before summarizing the\n\nevidence related to these incidents, two observations about the\n\nstate of the record are appropriate.\n\n          First, in recounting her conflicts with Reyes, plaintiff's\n\npro se papers sometimes appear to suggest that Calero's problems at\n\nwork derived not from a failure to accommodate her disability, but\n\nsimply from Reyes' general unfairness to her.   To the extent Calero\n\nmight succeed in placing blame for her problems at work on Reyes\n\npersonally, she may vindicate her own virtue but doom her case. The\n\nRehabilitation Act is not, of course, designed to provide a worker\n\na remedy against an arbitrary supervisor, per se.    It is designed\n\nto insure that a capable, disabled worker, covered by the statute,\n\nis not deprived of the opportunity to work and earn a living due to\n\nthe refusal of the employer to make a reasonable accommodation.\n\nViewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, therefore, the\n\nsummary below will concentrate on facts that a reasonable factfinder\n\nmight find supportive of this statutory claim, and not on Calero's\n\noccasional self-justifying suggestions that it was Reyes, not she,\n\nwho was responsible for their ongoing problems.\n\n          Second, we are aware in recounting this background that\n\na reasonable factfinder might conclude that Calero's friction with\n\nher supervisor (and, as will be seen, others including family and\n\n\n                                -6-\n\ffriends) might be explained on the ground that she was simply a very\n\ndifficult, not a disabled, person.            In the context of summary\n\njudgment, however, we must respect the role of the factfinder to\n\nchoose between alternative, reasonably supported inferences. Since\n\nthe   factual   mosaic,   seen   from   plaintiff's     perspective,   might\n\nreasonably support a claim of disability, we summarize the facts in\n\na manner consistent with that viewpoint.\n\n             The first episode of what was to be a lengthy series of\n\nproblems between Calero and Reyes arose over what should have been\n\na trivial matter. On March 9, 1998, Reyes denied Calero's request\n\nto make up a lost work hour during lunchtime.           In response, Calero\n\ncomplained in a loud voice that Reyes was the worst supervisor she\n\never had and that Reyes treated her like a child.            The outburst was\n\nvociferous enough to be overheard by other INS staff in the office.\n\n             The following day, March 10, 1998, Reyes asked Calero to\n\ncome to her office to discuss the previous day's contretemps.              At\n\nthe meeting, Reyes told Calero that raising her voice in the office\n\nwas not necessary.     Calero responded with a further verbal attack,\n\ncriticizing Reyes' supervisory skills, telling Reyes that she had\n\na bad attitude, and suggesting that Reyes had lost an appointment\n\nas an immigration judge because of her poor professional ability.\n\n             A week later, on March 17, 1999, Calero consulted Dr.\n\nFilia   S.   Garcia,   who   referred     Calero   to   a   psychologist   for\n\nevaluation of her \"masked depression.\"\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f             On March 18, 1998, Calero received a formal reprimand (a\n\nso-called memorandum of \"admonishment\") from Reyes for her behavior\n\non March 9th and 10th.\n\n             The day following her receipt of this reprimand, Calero\n\nsent an e-mail message to Jack Penca (\"Penca\"), the Regional\n\nDistrict Counsel and Reyes' immediate supervisor, who worked out of\n\nthe Vermont office of the INS, regarding the recent friction with\n\nReyes.   Calero complained to Penca that Reyes was harassing her and\n\nthat this daily harassment was affecting her emotionally.              Calero\n\ninformed Penca that she was taking the antidepressant Paxil \"to be\n\nable to continue working.\"       This was the first time Calero informed\n\na supervisor that she was suffering from depression and was on\n\nmedication for her condition.\n\n             In mid-April 1998, Calero was seen by psychiatrist Dr.\n\nMargarita Alonso Cedo (\"Dr. Alonso\").            On April 13th, Calero's\n\ncondition was serious enough that Dr. Alonso recommended to Calero\n\nthat she take a medical leave from work for the next three weeks.\n\nOn   April   17,   1998,   Dr.   Alonso    diagnosed   Calero   with   \"major\n\ndepression\" and, like Dr. Rodriguez in January 1998, prescribed the\n\nantidepressant Paxil.\n\n             Significantly, Dr. Alonso also wrote a note to Calero's\n\nemployer giving notice of Calero's condition and confirming her\n\nrecommendation that Calero take a three-week break from work. After\n\nreceiving two doctors' notes from Dr. Alonso explaining Calero's\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fdiagnosis,     medication    and    plan      for    treatment,     Reyes      approved\n\nCalero's sick leave, which lasted from April 14 to May 1, 1998.\n\n           On April 21, 1998, Calero contacted the Office of Equal\n\nEmployment Opportunity, Immigration and Naturalization Service, U.S.\n\nDepartment of Justice (\"EEO\") in Washington, D.C. to inquire about\n\nfiling a complaint for discrimination and harassment.                  On April 22,\n\n1998,    Calero   contacted     Dr.      Ruth       Prevor   (\"Dr.    Prevor\"),       a\n\npsychologist with the INS Employee Assistance Office.                     Thereafter,\n\nCalero   met   with    Dr.   Prevor      on    several   occasions        to    receive\n\nassistance regarding her mental disability.\n\n             Also on April 22nd, while Calero was on medical leave,\n\nReyes left Calero two memoranda instructing Calero to complete\n\ncertain tasks in preparation for her upcoming annual vacation.\n\nReyes asked Calero to review her cases scheduled for hearings in the\n\nimmigration    court   during      her   vacation      and   also    to     prepare   a\n\nparticular case to be discussed with Reyes before the vacation's\n\nstarting date, which was May 22, 1998.\n\n             On May 7, 1998, after Calero returned from her medical\n\nleave but before she left for her annual vacation, Calero and Reyes\n\nmet to discuss Calero's cases.           Reyes had previously requested that\n\nCalero copy her on certain e-mail messages, and Calero again entered\n\ninto a nasty argument with Reyes, this time about Reyes' concern\n\nthat Calero was failing to follow Reyes' instructions.                    Calero told\n\nReyes during this conversation that Reyes was reprimanding her as\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\fa mother might scold a child and treating her unfairly.   At the end\n\nof the meeting, Calero asked, with heavy sarcasm, \"Is that all\n\nVivian?   Can I leave now?\"   Later, when Reyes approached Calero's\n\ndesk and asked her why she had again failed to copy her on an e-mail\n\nas requested, Calero became furious and told Reyes to stop scolding\n\nher, that she was not a child and Reyes was not her mother.\n\nBizarrely, Calero began calling Reyes \"mother\" and \"mommy,\" refused\n\nto provide Reyes an explanation of why she did not copy Reyes on\n\ne-mail messages as Reyes had instructed, and repeated, \"Don't punish\n\nme, stop punishing me.\"    Again, this strange and confrontational\n\nbehavior was observed by other INS employees.\n\n           Not surprisingly, Reyes reported Calero's conduct to\n\nPenca.    Her memo summarized the May 7th incident and recommended\n\nthat disciplinary action be taken against Calero.   Reyes indicated\n\nthat Calero was a \"disruptive element\" and recommended that Calero\n\neither be dismissed or transferred out of the San Juan District\n\noffice.\n\n           On May 11, 1998, Calero mailed Penca a copy of her EEO\n\ncomplaint, and informed him that she had been getting counseling\n\nfrom the EEO office of the INS and that she was submitting the\n\ncomplaint to her EEO counselor. Penca subsequently forwarded a copy\n\nof the complaint to Reyes.\n\n           On May 22, 1998, Calero went on her scheduled two-week\n\nannual leave, returning to work on June 2, 1998.    Before she left\n\n\n                                -10-\n\fCalero   failed    to     prepare       her    cases    properly,    as     Reyes   had\n\ninstructed.\n\n           On   May      26,    1998,    Reyes   sent    a     memorandum    to   Penca\n\ndetailing Calero's failure to review her files, as requested. Reyes\n\nnoted that, in order to prepare the cases with hearings scheduled\n\nduring the two weeks Calero was out, she and another OGC attorney\n\nhad been required to work ten hours of overtime.\n\n           On June 22, 1998, Penca sent Calero a Notice of Proposed\n\nTen Day Suspension (\"Notice\").            The two grounds for this suspension\n\nwere: (1) Calero's disrespectful behavior toward Reyes on May 7,\n\n1998, and (2) Calero's disregard of Reyes' instruction to prepare\n\nher cases before going on leave.               Calero submitted a 35-page reply\n\nin opposition to this Notice.\n\n           On     July    23,    1998,    Calero       received    her    performance\n\nappraisal for July 1, 1997, through June 30, 1998.                  Calero received\n\na \"minimally satisfactory\" rating in the category of \"Advocates\n\nfor/Represents      the    Agency\"       but    was    given    ratings     of    \"fully\n\nsuccessful\" in categories of \"Provides Legal Advice\" and \"Conducts\n\nLegal Research and Writing.\" Her formal rating, overall, was \"fully\n\nsuccessful.\"\n\n           Despite these rather positive ratings, Calero received\n\nseveral negative comments in her review.                 For example, the review\n\nnoted that Calero failed to prepare several of her cases for\n\nhearings, that she failed to inform her supervisor of the status of\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\fher cases and that she required substantial supervision.                Despite\n\nher titularly satisfactory ratings, Calero viewed this as the first\n\nnegative review that she had received during her employment with the\n\nINS.\n\n              On June 24, 1998, Dr. Alonso again recommended that Calero\n\ntake a few days off from work to rest, and Calero did so.\n\n              Despite the rest, it was clear by the middle of the summer\n\nthat Calero's depression was infecting her relations with persons\n\nother than her supervisor.         In a memo dated August 12, 1998, Reyes\n\nnoted      Calero's    excessive   and   unwarranted       criticism   of   other\n\nattorneys, evident in the e-mails she was sending to lawyers outside\n\nthe office.\n\n              On August 17, 1998, at Dr. Alonso's recommendation, Calero\n\nwas \"partially\" hospitalized for ten days due to her depression.2\n\nIn addition, side effects from the antidepressant medication were\n\ntroubling     Calero    to   the   extent    that    Dr.   Alonso   changed   her\n\nprescription.\n\n              Following her partial hospitalization, on September 1,\n\n1998, Calero sent an e-mail entitled \"transfer on detail\" to Paul\n\nVirtue, General Counsel, INS (\"Virtue\"), with a copy to David Dixon,\n\nDeputy General Counsel, INS (\"Dixon\").              Calero informed Virtue and\n\nDixon that she had been suffering from major depression since April\n\n\n\n       2\n       The record does not indicate what is meant by \"partial\"\nhospitalization.\n\n                                      -12-\n\f13, 1998, and that she was being discriminated against and harassed\n\nby her supervisors, Reyes and Penca. She noted, among other things,\n\nINS' duty to consider a reasonable accommodation that would allow\n\nher to perform her job. As her own suggestion for an accommodation,\n\nshe requested a temporary assignment (a so called \"detail\") out of\n\nher   current      work   site,     to    the    INS    office      at    the   San     Juan\n\nInternational Airport.\n\n            The September 1, 1998, e-mail was the first of what would\n\nbe many explicit requests for some sort of an accommodation, or at\n\nleast a dialogue concerning accommodation, to permit plaintiff to\n\ncontinue    working       while    she    received      treatment        for    her   major\n\ndepression.        The    specific       accommodation       proposed      by    Calero    –\n\ntemporary assignment to the San Juan airport – may perhaps have\n\npresented certain practical problems for the INS. The record is not\n\nclear on this point, and, again, the appellees' failure to offer any\n\ndiscussion on the issue has handcuffed the court.                          It is clear,\n\nhowever,    that    Calero's       employer      made   no   effort       to    offer    any\n\nrealistic    alternative          accommodation,        or   even    to    discuss       the\n\ndifficulties that plaintiff's major depression was creating for her\n\nat work.\n\n            On September 4, 1998, Calero once again sent an e-mail\n\nnotification to Virtue, with a copy to Dixon, to the effect that the\n\nlack of any response by the INS to her complaints was causing a\n\ndeterioration of her physical and emotional health, and that she was\n\n\n                                          -13-\n\frequesting an alternative assignment as a reasonable accommodation\n\nfor her disability of depression.\n\n           On September 8, 1998, a simmering problem related to\n\nCalero's apparent tape recording in the office boiled over. In June\n\nof 1998, some co-workers of Calero's had told Reyes that they\n\nthought that Calero was taping their conversations.     In response,\n\nReyes sent out an e-mail reminding all staff that surreptitious tape\n\nrecording of conversations was impermissible, against INS policy,\n\nand could result in discipline.     On September 8th, a staff member\n\ntold Reyes that she observed Calero using a tape recorder while\n\ntalking with Reyes.   Reyes approached Calero, obtained the recorder\n\nafter some argument and found that, indeed, the tape contained a\n\nrecording of her conversation. When Reyes told Calero she was going\n\nto take the tape, Calero screamed at her and tried to block the\n\ndoorway.   After she managed to make her exit, Reyes turned the tape\n\nover to the local FBI office.\n\n           Some months later, in a letter to Penca, dated January 20,\n\n1999, Calero claimed that someone in the office had been attempting\n\nto tape her conversations without her knowledge in order to \"frame\"\n\nher.   She asserted that she taped Reyes inadvertently, unaware that\n\nthe tape recorder was turned on.\n\n           On September 14, 1998, after the screaming incident over\n\nthe tape recorder, Dr. Alonso recommended that Calero take a medical\n\nleave from work for two weeks.\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\f            On October 7, 1998, Dixon suspended Calero for five days\n\nfor disrespectful behavior toward her supervisor and for failure to\n\nfollow orders.     Dixon based his decision on Penca's Notice of\n\nProposed Action issued on June 22, 1998, Calero's response, and\n\nReyes' memorandum of admonishment of March 18, 1998.\n\n            Later in October, Calero e-mailed Virtue a third time and\n\nagain requested a temporary assignment to the INS Airport office in\n\nSan Juan.    Once more, she received no response.\n\n            On October 30, 1998, when a new attorney was being hired\n\nin the office, Reyes contacted Calero and gave her the choice of\n\neither accepting replacement furniture for her office and keeping\n\nher office, or keeping her newer furniture and turning her office\n\nover to the new attorney.   Calero chose to keep her newer furniture\n\nand was moved to a less desirable work area, described by Calero as\n\na \"grot.\"\n\n            On November 2, 1998, Dr. Alonso observed, in a handwritten\n\nnote on a prescription pad, that Calero should be transferred to a\n\ndifferent workplace in Puerto Rico so that \"she could benefit from\n\ncontinued treatment, decreased stressful situations and family\n\nsupport.\"     It is not clear whether this notation reached the\n\ndefendants.\n\n            The following day, Calero faxed Virtue her fourth request\n\nfor an accommodation.    She detailed the medical treatment she was\n\nreceiving, described the discrimination and harassment she perceived\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fherself as suffering and emphasized her concern that her depression\n\nwas affecting her job performance.      Significantly, Calero disclosed\n\nto Virtue that her problems went beyond her relationship with Reyes:\n\n          Due to the depression, I have detached myself\n          from my family and friends, who have been very\n          worry [sic] about me and had been reaching me\n          and giving me support. My social life had been\n          extremely limited.\n\nIn this November 3, 1998, letter, Calero again asked for a transfer\n\nto the San Juan International Airport office.      Again, the INS made\n\nno response.\n\n          On   November   9,   1998,      Dr.   Alonso   made   another\n\nrecommendation that Calero absent herself from work in order to rest\n\nfor the remainder of the week.    Three days later, Calero made yet\n\nanother request to be transferred to the San Juan International\n\nAirport office in a letter to Virtue.     At the end of that month, Dr.\n\nAlonso recommended Calero rest from work for ten days starting\n\nNovember 27, 1998.\n\n          On December 9, 1998, Reyes issued a Notice of a Proposal\n\nof Suspension of Calero for fourteen days for (1) failure to follow\n\norders by surreptitiously tape-recording conversations in the office\n\non September 8, 1998; (2) failure to follow orders by refusing to\n\nupdate Reyes on a particular case; and (3) failure to be forthright\n\nwith a supervisor by taping conversations in the office and then\n\ndenying doing so.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\f            On December 15, 1998, Michael Coaster, a Division Chief\n\nwith the INS' Office of the General Counsel (\"Coaster\"), denied\n\nCalero's requests for an accommodation.            His letter stated:\n\n            You wrote that you are depressed because \"of\n            the discrimination and harassment based on sex\n            and national origin that (you) have endured\n            within the INS San Juan District Office.\" This\n            is not a disability as defined by the\n            Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Age\n            Discrimination in Employment Act. As such, the\n            agency is not under an obligation to provide\n            you with an accommodation.\n\n            This letter made no mention of the medical evidence\n\nsubmitted by Calero confirming her major depression.              The Coaster\n\nletter did indicate that the INS had at some unspecified time\n\noffered   to   consider   reassigning     Calero    to   an   existing    vacant\n\nposition outside Puerto Rico, but that Calero had rejected this\n\noffer because she did not want to leave Puerto Rico.               Except for\n\nthis reference in the Coaster letter, no documentation exists in the\n\nrecord memorializing this supposed offer to transfer Calero.                    No\n\ndetails specify the location or nature of the new position, the\n\ntiming of the supposed transfer, or the identity and authority of\n\nthe person making the offer.\n\n            On February 4, 1999, Calero filed her second EEO complaint\n\nalleging discrimination based on gender, national origin, age,\n\nmental and physical disability, and retaliation.\n\n            On February 16, 1999, Penca found the second ground of\n\nReyes'    Proposed   Suspension   of   December     to   be   supported    by    a\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\fpreponderance of the evidence.     Penca determined that disciplinary\n\naction for Calero's failure to follow orders in reporting to Reyes\n\nthe status of a case was warranted and imposed a ten day suspension\n\nwithout pay on February 16, 1999. In response, Calero filed several\n\ncomplaints     with   law   enforcement    agencies    calling    for   an\n\ninvestigation    of   the   supposed   illegal   tape-recording   of    her\n\nconversations by coworkers.\n\n          On April 6, 1999, Reyes reminded Calero that she was late\n\nfor an appearance before an immigration judge.        In response Calero\n\nfalsely denied that she was late. It later emerged that the judge\n\nhad been kept waiting because of Calero's tardiness.\n\n          In early May 1999, Calero was involved in yet another\n\nunseemly office incident.       Calero told a student-employee, Lenga\n\nSiberon (\"Siberon\"), to be on guard for \"illegal things\" that Reyes\n\nmight ask her to do.         Siberon replied that she was not doing\n\nanything illegal. In a written statement provided to Reyes, Siberon\n\nreported that she felt \"intimidated and somewhat threatened\" by\n\nCalero.\n\n             On June 4, 1999, a second disturbing incident involving\n\nCalero and a different student-employee occurred.           The student,\n\nCarmen Ortiz (\"Ortiz\"), did not interrupt a meeting to give Calero\n\ntwo telephone messages from Calero's son.        Calero exploded at Ortiz\n\nfor not giving her the messages immediately, screaming at the young\n\nwoman and berating her.\n\n\n                                  -18-\n\f             On    June   11,   1999,    Calero's   counsel,   Miriam   Ramos\n\nGrateroles, faxed a letter to Doris Meissner, the Commissioner of\n\nthe   INS.        Calero's counsel requested that Calero be given          a\n\nreasonable accommodation in accordance with the Rehabilitation Act\n\nand that she be transferred to the Airport office.             She also wrote\n\nthat the conduct and behavior of Reyes was the principal factor\n\nunderlying Calero's major depression and that some separation from\n\nReyes and the environment at the San Juan office would allow Calero\n\nto continue to work despite her disability.           Calero's counsel also\n\nincluded a note from Dr. Alonso, which reported that Calero was\n\nhaving difficulty interacting with family and friends due to her\n\ndepression.       The doctor recommended that any transfer of Calero be\n\nwithin Puerto Rico, so that Calero could receive needed family and\n\ncommunity support to the extent possible during her illness.\n\n             At work, plaintiff's behavioral manifestations of her\n\nsevere depression continued.        During the spring and summer of 1999,\n\nReyes reported to Penca that Calero was at various times \"agitated,\"\n\n\"out of control,\" \"impossible to work with,\" \"bizarre,\" and \"a\n\nconstant source of aggravation.\"               On July 9, 1999, during a\n\ndiscussion of a scheduling conflict, Calero repeatedly stated in a\n\nloud voice, in the presence of two other employees, that Reyes was\n\nharassing her on a daily basis, and that her absences were due to\n\nReyes' constant humiliation.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -19-\n\f          The final blow-up between Calero and Reyes occurred four\n\ndays later.    Again, the trigger for the eruption should have been\n\na routine matter.    Reyes instructed Calero to leave for court so\n\nthat she would be on time.   In a raised voice, Calero called Reyes\n\na liar and stated that Penca and Reyes had made false accusations\n\nagainst her and fabricated evidence against her.   Once again, other\n\nemployees were in the area and overheard the contentious exchange\n\nbetween the two.\n\n          The following day, July 14, 1999, Reyes placed Calero on\n\npaid administrative leave, where she remained until her termination\n\nthe following May.\n\n          On January 3, 2000, Bo Cooper, General Counsel of the INS,\n\nissued a Notice of Proposed Removal to Calero. The Notice was based\n\non four specific grounds: (1) making statements to a co-worker that\n\nadvocated the mistrust of a mutual supervisor and resulted in\n\nanxiety in the workplace; (2) disruptive behavior; (3) conduct\n\nunbecoming    a Service attorney; and (4) disrespectful behavior\n\ntowards a supervisor.\n\n          On May 4, 2000, Marc Salans (\"Salans\"), Assistant Director\n\nof the Office of Attorney Personnel Management of the Department of\n\nJustice, found Calero's removal warranted and made her termination\n\neffective as of May 19, 2000.\n\n\n\n\n                                -20-\n\f                        III.   Standard of Review\n\n            We review a district court's ruling on cross-motions for\n\nsummary judgment de novo. See Bienkowski v. Northeastern Univ., 285\n\nF.3d 138, 140 (1st Cir. 2002); Wightman v. Springfield Terminal Ry.\n\nCo., 100 F.3d 228, 230 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n            Summary judgment is appropriate when \"the pleadings,\n\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\n\ntogether with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine\n\nissue as to a material fact and that the moving party is entitled\n\nto a judgment as a matter of law.\"            Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).        A\n\n\"genuine\" issue is one that could be resolved in favor of either\n\nparty, and a \"material fact\" is one that has the potential of\n\naffecting the outcome of the case.         See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby,\n\nInc., 477 U.S. 242, 248-50 (1986).\n\n            Once the moving party has asserted that no genuine issue\n\nof material fact exists, the burden is on the opposing party to\n\npoint to specific facts demonstrating that there is, indeed, a\n\ntrialworthy issue.      Nat'l Amusements, Inc. v. Town of Dedham, 43\n\nF.3d 731, 735 (1st Cir. 1995).     Not every genuine factual conflict,\n\nof course, necessitates a trial.      \"It is only when a disputed fact\n\nhas the potential to change the outcome of the suit under the\n\ngoverning   law   if   found   favorably    to   the   nonmovant   that   the\n\nmateriality hurdle is cleared.\"            Parrilla-Burgos v. Hernandez-\n\nRivera, 108 F.3d 445, 448 (1st Cir. 1997) (citation omitted).\n\n\n                                   -21-\n\f            On the other hand, to survive summary judgment a plaintiff\n\nis not required to rely only on uncontradicted evidence.         Medina-\n\nMunoz v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 896 F.2d 5, 9 n.3 (1st Cir.\n\n1990).    In this case, as noted, the record as a whole presents many\n\ninconsistencies, displaying perspectives that favor in some lights\n\nthe defendants and in others the plaintiff.             So long as the\n\nplaintiff's evidence is both cognizable and sufficiently strong to\n\nsupport a verdict in her favor, the factfinder must be allowed to\n\ndetermine which version of the facts is most compelling.\n\n                            IV.   Discussion\n\n            Two issues are in play in this appeal: first, whether on\n\nthe   record   a   reasonable   factfinder   might   conclude   that   the\n\ndefendants violated the Rehabilitation Act by failing to offer\n\nCalero a reasonable accommodation for her disability;             second,\n\nwhether a factfinder might reasonably find that the defendants\n\nviolated Title VII by retaliating against Calero for asserting her\n\nrights.    We begin with the claim under the Rehabilitation Act.\n\n            A. Discrimination Based on Disability\n\n            The ADA and Rehabilitation Act prohibit discrimination\n\nagainst an otherwise qualified individual based on his or her\n\ndisability.     The Rehabilitation Act, the precursor to the ADA,\n\napplies to federal agencies, contractors and recipients of federal\n\nfinancial assistance, while the ADA applies to private employers\n\nwith over 15 employees and state and local governments.         Although,\n\n\n                                  -22-\n\fas noted supra n.1, the ADA does not apply here, the case law\n\nconstruing the ADA generally pertains equally to claims under the\n\nRehabilitation Act.\n\n          The federal statutes barring discrimination based on\n\ndisability do more than merely prohibit disparate treatment; they\n\nalso impose an affirmative duty on employers to offer a \"reasonable\n\naccommodation\" to a disabled employee.   42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A).\n\nGarcía-Ayala v. Lederle Parenterals, Inc., 212 F.3d 638, 646 n.9\n\n(1st Cir. 2000).\n\n          To assert a claim for failure to accommodate under the\n\nRehabilitation Act, Calero would have to establish the following:\n\n(1) that she suffered from a \"disability\" within the meaning of the\n\nstatute; (2) that she was a qualified individual in that she was\n\nable to perform the essential functions of her job, either with or\n\nwithout a reasonable accommodation; and (3) that, despite her\n\nemployer's knowledge of her disability, the employer did not offer\n\na reasonable accommodation for the disability. See Carroll v. Xerox\n\nCorp., 294 F.3d 231, 237 (1st Cir. 2002); Higgins v. New Balance\n\nAthletic Shoe, Inc., 194 F.3d 252, 264 (1st Cir. 1999). We will\n\naddress each of these three elements separately.3\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      Two other elements, sometimes noted, require no discussion.\nIt is undisputed that the defendants are covered by the\nRehabilitation Act, and that plaintiff suffered in the terms and\nconditions of her employment.\n\n                               -23-\n\f          1. Disability\n\n          The ADA defines \"disability\" as either (a) a physical or\n\nmental impairment which substantially limits one or more of an\n\nindividual's major life activities; (b) a record of such impairment;\n\nor (c) being regarded as having such an impairment.      42 U.S.C. §\n\n12102(2); see also 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(g). Here, plaintiff contends,\n\nunder subsection (a), that she actually suffered a mental impairment\n\nthat limited one or more of her major life activities.\n\n           It is well established that the determination of whether\n\na plaintiff has a disability must be made on a case-by-case basis.\n\nSee Toyota Motor Mfg., Ky., Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184, 198\n\n(2002); Sutton v. United Airlines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471, 483 (1999).\n\nThe analysis leading to this determination requires the court to\n\nconsider the record in the light of three questions. First, did the\n\nplaintiff suffer a physical or mental impairment?    Second, did the\n\n\"life activity\" limited by the impairment qualify as \"major\"?\n\nFinally, did the impairment, in fact, substantially limit the\n\nplaintiff's identified major life activity?    See Bragdon v. Abbott,\n\n524 U.S. 624, 630-31 (1998).    The burden is on the plaintiff to\n\nestablish these three elements.       See Bailey v. Georgia-Pacific\n\nCorp., 306 F.3d 1162, 1167 (1st Cir. 2002); Carroll, 294 F.3d at\n\n238.   We now take up these three inquiries.\n\n\n\n\n                               -24-\n\f          a. Did the Plaintiff Suffer a Mental Impairment?\n\n          The answer to the first question, on the facts of this\n\ncase, is obviously in the affirmative.   This circuit has recognized\n\ndepression as a mental impairment that may constitute, at least in\n\nsome circumstances, a disability under federal law.   See Criado v.\n\nIBM Corp., 145 F.3d 437, 442 (1st Cir. 1998).     A number of other\n\ncircuits have also recognized depression as a qualifying mental\n\nimpairment.    See, e.g., Ogborn v. United Food & Commercial Workers\n\nUnion, Local No. 881, 305 F.3d 763, 767 (7th Cir. 2002) (\"Major\n\ndepression can constitute a disability under the ADA.\"); Snead v.\n\nMetro. Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co., 237 F.3d 1080, 1088 n.8 (9th Cir.\n\n2001) (\"In Oregon, stress and depression can be considered mental\n\nimpairments.    The same is true under the ADA.\"); Pritchard v.\n\nSouthern Co. Servs., 92 F.3d 1130, 1132 (11th Cir. 1996), amended\n\nin part on reh'g, 102 F.3d 1118, cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1274 (1997)\n\n(\"Depression has been held to constitute a mental impairment.\"); Doe\n\nv. Region 13 Mental Health-Mental Retardation Comm'n., 704 F.2d\n\n1402, 1408 (5th Cir. 1983) (same).\n\n          Moreover, the record in this case provides more than\n\nsufficient evidence to permit a factfinder to conclude that the\n\nplaintiff, in fact, was suffering from major depression during the\n\nrelevant period.    The record confirms Calero's prior history of\n\ndepression, her diagnosis of depression by at least two physicians,\n\nher antidepressant medication, her numerous required medical leaves\n\n\n                                -25-\n\ffrom work, and her partial hospitalization.   In sum, as a matter of\n\nlaw and of fact, the record clearly favors the plaintiff on the\n\nfirst of the three pertinent questions.    A factfinder could easily\n\ndetermine that she suffered a qualified mental impairment.       To\n\ndetermine whether the record would support a finding that plaintiff\n\nsuffered a disability, we now turn to the next question.\n\n          b.     Did the Plaintiff's Mental Impairment Limit\n                 a \"Major\" Life Activity?\n\n          Calero has highlighted numerous life activities that she\n\nsays were limited by her depression: sleeping, eating, learning,\n\nconcentrating, thinking, working and interacting with others.      A\n\n\"major life activity\" is an activity of central importance to\n\npeople's daily lives.   Toyota Motor, 534 U.S. at 197.   Many of the\n\nactivities cited by the plaintiff have been recognized, by this\n\ncourt or others, as \"major,\" including sleeping and eating, Criado,\n\n145 F.3d at 442-43; Lawson v. CSX Transp., Inc., 245 F.3d 916, 923\n\n(7th Cir. 2001), learning, Bercovitch v. Baldwin Sch., Inc., 133\n\nF.3d 141, 155 (1st Cir. 1998), and thinking and concentrating,\n\nWhitney v. Greenberg, Rosenblatt, Kull & Bitsoli, P.C., 258 F.3d.\n\n30, 33 n.4 (1st Cir. 2001).   The Supreme Court has assumed, without\n\ndeciding, that working itself may be considered a major life\n\nactivity for purposes of the ADA.         Sutton, 527 U.S. at 492.\n\nLikewise, this court has on occasion assumed arguendo that working\n\nmight be deemed a major life activity under the Rehabilitation Act.\n\nSee, e.g., Bailey, 306 F.3d at 1168 n.5; Carroll, 294 F.3d at 239;\n\n                                -26-\n\fGelabert-Ladenheim v. American Airlines, Inc., 252 F.3d 54, 58 (1st\n\nCir. 2001).\n\n            In granting summary judgment        for the defendant, the\n\ndistrict court did not take issue with plaintiff's claim that her\n\ndisability interfered with one or more of these recognized major\n\nlife activities.      Moreover, as noted, the appellees' brief has\n\noffered us not a word of discussion on the issue.          In view of the\n\ndocumented severity of plaintiff's disability, we assume that the\n\ndefendants concede, at least for purposes of summary judgment, that\n\nit interfered with one      or   more of the major life activities\n\nspecified by Calero.\n\n            c. Was the Major Life Activity \"Substantially\" Limited?\n\n            It is a simple matter to find sufficient evidence in the\n\nrecord that Calero's mental impairment did \"substantially\" limit a\n\nmajor    life   activity.   Although     the   federal   statutes   do   not\n\nexplicitly define the phrase \"substantially limits,\" in Sutton the\n\nSupreme Court instructed that the phrase \"suggests 'considerable'\n\nor 'specified to a large degree.'\"       Sutton, 527 U.S. at 491.        Even\n\nso,     \"while substantial limitations should be considerable, they\n\nalso should not be equated with 'utter inabilities.'\"           Taylor v.\n\nPhoenixville Sch. Dist., 184 F.3d 296, 307 (3d Cir. 1999). The\n\nSupreme Court has stated that \"[w]hen significant limitations result\n\nfrom an impairment, the disability definition is met even if the\n\ndifficulties are not unsurmountable.\"          Bragdon, 524 U.S. at 641.\n\n\n                                  -27-\n\fAn impairment can substantially limit a major life activity, even\n\nthough the plaintiff is still able to engage in the activity to some\n\nextent.     See Gillen v. Fallon Ambulance Serv., Inc., 283 F.3d 11,\n\n22 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n            As before, neither the district court nor the appellees\n\nhere have contested Calero's assertion that her major depression\n\nsubstantially limited one or more of her recognized major life\n\nactivities.        Given this, we must conclude by default that the\n\nevidence was sufficient to satisfy the first element of Calero's\n\nRehabilitation Act claim; she did suffer a \"disability.\"                  The next\n\nquestion is whether she was a \"qualified individual.\" Was she able\n\nto perform the essential functions of her job, with or without an\n\naccommodation?\n\n            2. Qualified Individual\n\n            To be a \"qualified individual\" under the Rehabilitation\n\nAct, a plaintiff must show first that she possesses the requisite\n\nskill, experience, education and other job-related requirements for\n\nthe position and, second, that she is able to perform the essential\n\nfunctions     of     the   position     with     or       without   a   reasonable\n\naccommodation.       García-Ayala, 212 F.3d at 646.\n\n            An     \"essential   function\"      is     a   fundamental    job   duty\n\nassociated with a particular position; this function can extend\n\nbeyond    \"'an     employee's   technical      skills      and   experience,   even\n\nincluding    such    individual   or    idiosyncratic         characteristics    as\n\n\n                                       -28-\n\fscheduling flexibility.'\"           Ward, 209 F.3d at 34 (quoting Laurin v.\n\nProvidence Hosp., 150 F.3d 52, 59 n.6 (1st Cir. 1998)).\n\n            In this case, the evidence shows that Calero was an\n\nexperienced trial attorney. She practiced law for over twenty years\n\nand had two successful years of prior experience in this same\n\nposition in the INS' New York Office.             She received above average\n\nto excellent performance reviews through June 30, 1998.                     Based on\n\nthis,   a   factfinder      might    easily   find     that   she    possessed    the\n\nrequisite    skill    and   experience     for   the    position      of   Assistant\n\nDistrict Counsel.\n\n            A much closer question is whether a reasonable factfinder\n\ncould conclude that Calero, while suffering the powerful effects of\n\nher disability, still possessed the ability to function competently\n\nand productively in the workplace, either without any modification\n\nof her work situation or with a reasonable accommodation.                        After\n\nall, an employee who is unable to control her bizarre and disruptive\n\nbehavior may be unfit for employment, no matter how advanced her\n\nobjective    skills    or    how    extensive    her    experience.         Although\n\nappellees' brief ignores the issue entirely, the district court\n\nanchored its summary judgment ruling, in part, on its conclusion\n\nthat the record indisputably confirmed plaintiff's inability to\n\nperform her job at an acceptable level.\n\n            A plaintiff offering a claim under the Rehabilitation Act\n\nconfronts    a   potential     \"Catch-22\"     when     arguing      that   she   is   a\n\n\n                                       -29-\n\fqualified individual under the Act.            She must show both that her\n\nimpairment substantially limits a major life activity and that she\n\nis \"otherwise qualified\" for her job, meaning she is able to perform\n\nthe essential functions her position requires, or would be if\n\nreasonably    accommodated.        In   shorthand,     the   law   requires       the\n\nindividual     to   be   both    substantially       limited     and     reasonably\n\nfunctional.     Several authors have discussed this quandary.                  E.g.,\n\nJonathan Brown, Defining Disability in 2001: A Lower Court Odyssey,\n\n23 WHITTIER L. REV . 335, 381-85 (2001); Chai R. Feldblum, Definition\n\nof Disability under Federal Anti-Discrimination Law: What Happened?\n\nWhy? And What Can We Do About It?; 21 BERKELEY J. EMP . & LAB . L. 91,\n\n160-61 (2000); Randal I. Goldstein, Note, Mental Illness in the\n\nWorkplace after Sutton v. United Airlines, 86 CORNELL L. REV . 927, 944\n\n(2001).\n\n             This   court   need    not    explore    the      nuances    of     this\n\ninteresting conundrum, since the record in this case is adequate to\n\ngenerate an issue for consideration by a factfinder regarding\n\nplaintiff's capacity to perform her job, even while suffering her\n\nmajor depression, with or without an accommodation. The defendants'\n\nown evaluation, issued less than a year before plaintiff ceased\n\nworking for the INS and several months after Calero's attack of\n\ndepression, gave Calero a job rating, not merely of average, but of\n\n\"fully    successful.\"      In   other    words,     despite    some     flaws    and\n\nproblems, the INS pronounced itself fully satisfied with Calero's\n\n\n                                        -30-\n\flevel   of   performance     even      while    she   suffered    from   her    major\n\ndepression.       Contrary facts produced at a trial may very well put\n\nin play the question of Calero's capacity to perform, but this\n\ndocumentation alone entitles the plaintiff to consideration by a\n\nfactfinder of the second element of her claim.\n\n             To    satisfy   the       third    and    final     element   of     her\n\nRehabilitation Act claim, plaintiff must prove that her employer,\n\nhaving knowledge of her disability, failed to offer her a reasonable\n\naccommodation.\n\n             3. Reasonable Accommodation\n\n             If an employer, aware of an employee's disability, refuses\n\nto provide a requested reasonable accommodation, the                       employer\n\nviolates the Rehabilitation Act, unless it can show that the\n\nproposed     accommodation       would   pose    an   undue     hardship   for    its\n\nbusiness.     See Higgins, 194 F.3d at 264.\n\n             Reasonable accommodations may include \"job restructuring,\n\npart-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant\n\nposition . . . and other similar accommodations for individuals with\n\ndisabilities.\" 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9) (B). A careful, individualized\n\nreview of an accommodation request in light of the specific facts\n\nof   the   case    is   needed    to   determine      whether    the   request    was\n\nreasonable. García-Ayala, 212 F.3d at 647.\n\n             To show that a proposed accommodation was reasonable, a\n\nplaintiff must prove \"not only that the proposed accommodation would\n\n\n                                         -31-\n\fenable her to perform the essential functions of her job, but also\n\nthat, at least on the face of things, it is feasible for the\n\nemployer under the circumstances.\"      Reed v. LePage Bakeries, Inc.,\n\n244 F.3d 254, 259 (1st Cir. 2001).       The request for accommodation\n\nmust be \"'sufficiently direct and specific,' giving notice that she\n\nneeds a 'special accommodation.'\"        Id. at 261 (quoting Wynne v.\n\nTufts Univ., 976 F.2d 791, 795 (1st Cir. 1992)).\n\n            If the plaintiff offers proof that a sufficiently specific\n\nrequest was made, the defendant may attempt to prove that, in fact,\n\nthe proposed accommodation was not feasible and would constitute an\n\n\"undue\" hardship.      Id.    An adequately supported denial of an\n\naccommodation request requires the employer \"to produce at least\n\nsome modicum of evidence showing that the [requested accommodation]\n\nwould be a hardship, financial or otherwise.\" Ward, 209 F.3d at 37.\n\n            In some cases, a request for a reasonable accommodation\n\nmay trigger a responsibility on the part of the employer to enter\n\ninto an interactive process with the employee to determine an\n\nappropriate accommodation.    Reed, 244 F.3d at 262 n.11.      The ADA's\n\nregulations state that \"it may be necessary for the covered entity\n\nto initiate an informal, interactive process with the qualified\n\nindividual.\"    29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o) (1) (iii).       The scope of the\n\nemployer's obligation in this process is not crystal clear, but\n\n\"[t]he employer has at least some responsibility in determining the\n\nnecessary   accommodation,\"   since     \"the   regulations   envision   an\n\n\n                                 -32-\n\finteractive process that requires participation by both parties.\"\n\n29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o) (3).\n\n           As     this   court   has   noted,       this   interactive     process\n\n\"requires a great deal of communication between the employee and\n\nemployer.\"   García-Ayala, 212 F.3d at 648 n.12, citing Criado, 145\n\nF.3d at 444.      An employer's refusal to participate in the process\n\nmay itself constitute evidence of a violation of the statute.                     See\n\nJacques v. Clean-Up Group, Inc., 96 F.3d 506, 515 (1st Cir. 1996)\n\n(\"There may well be situations in which the employer's failure to\n\nengage in an informal interactive process would constitute a failure\n\nto provide a reasonable accommodation that amounts to a violation\n\nof the ADA.\").\n\n           Other circuits have also found that both the employee and\n\na   responsible    representative      of     the   employer   have    a   duty    to\n\nparticipate in this process. See, e.g., Mengine v. Runyon, 114 F.3d\n\n415, 420 (3d Cir. 1997) (\"We agree that both parties have a duty to\n\nassist in the search for an appropriate reasonable accommodation and\n\nto act in good faith.\"); Beck v. Univ. of Wis. Bd. of Regents, 75\n\nF.3d 1130, 1135 (7th Cir. 1996) (\"A party that obstructs or delays\n\nthe interactive process is not acting in good faith.                  A party that\n\nfails to communicate, by way of initiation or response, may also be\n\nacting in bad faith.      In essence, courts should attempt to isolate\n\nthe cause of the breakdown and then assign responsibility.\"); Taylor\n\nv. Principal Fin. Group, Inc., 93 F.3d 155, 165 (5th Cir. 1996)\n\n\n                                       -33-\n\f(\"[O]nce an accommodation is properly requested, the responsibility\n\nfor fashioning a reasonable accommodation is shared between the\n\nemployee and employer.    Thus, it is the employee's initial request\n\nfor accommodation which triggers       the employer's obligation to\n\nparticipate in the interactive process of determining one.\").\n\n          Viewing the facts of this case in the light of these\n\nprinciples, and faced yet again with an utter lack of argument on\n\nthis point by appellees' counsel, the court must conclude that the\n\nevidence regarding reasonable accommodation, while conflicting, is\n\nsufficient to generate an issue for a factfinder when viewed in the\n\nlight most favorable to the plaintiff.    First, Calero requested an\n\naccommodation on at least six occasions, specifically identifying\n\na transfer as an acceptable form of accommodation. Second, Calero's\n\nsupervisor, Reyes - usually her adversary - seconded Calero's\n\nrequest by suggesting the transfer herself.     Third, on the record\n\nas it stands, a factfinder could find that Calero's suggestion of\n\na transfer to a work site at the San Juan airport was \"at least on\n\nthe face of things\" feasible.   Fourth, a factfinder could also find\n\nthat the defendants failed to offer a sufficient \"modicum of\n\nevidence\" showing that the accommodation proposed by plaintiff would\n\nconstitute a hardship.4   Fifth, even if the proposed accommodation\n\n\n     4\n       At oral argument, appellees' counsel dismissed the notion of\na transfer to the INS office at the San Juan airport,\ncharacterizing it as, essentially, unworkable and unprecedented.\nThe record of the case, however, offers no concrete evidence of any\njustification offered by the defendants to support their rejection\n\n                                -34-\n\fmight in some way have been less than ideal from defendants'\n\nviewpoint – for reasons not articulated anywhere in the record – a\n\nfactfinder could well find that the defendants failed to engage in\n\nany good faith interactive process to explore whether some variant\n\nof the plaintiff's proposal might have been workable.     Indeed, a\n\nfactfinder might well conclude that, in the face of plaintiff's\n\nincreasingly desperate requests for an accommodation, the defendants\n\nsimply stonewalled – going so far as to deny, in the face of\n\nsubstantial medical evidence, that plaintiff suffered a disability\n\nat all.   Finally, to the extent that the record hints that the\n\ndefendants, at some unspecified point and in some unspecified way,\n\noffered a transfer out of Puerto Rico as an accommodation (and the\n\nrecord supplies only a wisp of indirect evidence on this point), a\n\nfactfinder could well conclude that the offer was either grossly\n\ninappropriate, given plaintiff's medical condition, or lacking in\n\ngood faith.\n\n          In sum, the record offers sufficient evidence from which\n\na factfinder could conclude that the defendants, being aware of\n\nplaintiff's disability and of her request for accommodation, failed\n\nto make a reasonable response.     Given that the record contains\n\nevidence that, if believed by a factfinder, might have proved (1)\n\nthat Calero did suffer from a disability within the meaning of the\n\nstatute, (2) that she was a qualified individual who was able to\n\n\nof the requested accommodation.\n\n                               -35-\n\fperform the functions of her job, and (3) that her employer failed\n\nto reasonably accommodate her disability, plaintiff was entitled to\n\npresent her Rehabilitation Act claim to a factfinder.\n\n          B. Title VII Retaliation Claim\n\n          To   prove   a   claim   of   retaliation,   a   plaintiff   must\n\nestablish that (1) she engaged in protected conduct; (2) she\n\nexperienced an adverse employment action; and (3) there was a causal\n\nconnection between the protected conduct and the adverse employment\n\naction.   See Gu v. Boston Police Dep't., 312 F.3d 6, 14 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).\n\n          The district court held that Calero did prove the first\n\ntwo elements of her retaliation claim. She did engage in protected\n\nactivity by filing her two complaints with the INS' EEO office, and\n\nshe was subjected to adverse employment actions. However, the court\n\nheld that the evidence was insufficient, even viewed in the light\n\nmost favorable to the plaintiff, to prove a causal connection\n\nbetween the protected activity and the adverse employment actions.\n\n           Calero relies primarily on the timing of the employment\n\nactions as her primary evidence of causal connection. The Supreme\n\nCourt has stated that \"[t]he cases that accept mere temporal\n\nproximity between an employer’s knowledge of protected activity and\n\nan adverse employment action as sufficient evidence of causality to\n\nestablish a prima facie case uniformly hold that the temporal\n\nproximity must be 'very close.'\"           Clark County Sch. Dist. v.\n\n\n                                   -36-\n\fBreeden, 532 U.S. 268, 273-74 (2001) (citation omitted).               Three and\n\nfour month periods have been held insufficient to establish a causal\n\nconnection based on temporal proximity.            See Richmond v. ONEOK,\n\nInc., 120 F.3d 205, 209 (10th Cir. 1997); Hughes v. Derwinski, 967\n\nF.2d 1169, 1174-75 (7th Cir. 1992).           We have held that \"a showing\n\nof   discharge   soon    after   the   employee   engages    in   an    activity\n\nspecifically protected by . . . Title VII . . . is indirect proof\n\nof a causal connection between the firing and the activity because\n\nit is strongly suggestive of retaliation.\" Oliver v. Digital Equip.\n\nCorp., 846 F.2d 103, 110 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\n           The   facts    demonstrate     sufficient   temporal        proximity\n\nbetween the protected conduct and the employment action in this case\n\nto make out a prima facie case.         On March 18, 1998, Calero received\n\nthe memorandum of admonishment, the first adverse employment action.\n\nOn April 21, 1998, Calero first contacted the EEO Office.                On May\n\n11, 1998, Calero filed her first EEO complaint.             Calero sent Penca\n\na copy of this complaint, and Penca in turn, forwarded the complaint\n\nto Reyes. We have noted that the prima facie burden in this context\n\nis not an onerous one. Fennell v. First Step Designs, Ltd., 83 F.3d\n\n526, 535-36 (1st Cir. 1996).            As plaintiff received her first\n\nproposed suspension on June 22, 1998, roughly a month after she made\n\ndefendants aware that she filed her EEO complaint, we find plaintiff\n\nhas met her burden of making out a prima facie case of retaliation.\n\n           Once the plaintiff has made a prima facie showing of\n\n\n                                       -37-\n\fretaliation, the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting approach is\n\nemployed,    and   defendant    must   articulate   a   legitimate,   non-\n\nretaliatory reason for its employment decision.         If the defendant\n\nmeets this burden, the plaintiff must now show that the proffered\n\nlegitimate reason is in fact a pretext and that the job action was\n\nthe result of the defendant's retaliatory animus.          See St. Mary's\n\nHonor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 510-11 (1993).           We have noted\n\nthe manner in which courts should consider the McDonnell Douglas\n\nanalysis in the context of summary judgment: \"[O]n summary judgment,\n\nthe need to order the presentation of proof is largely obviated, and\n\na court may often dispense with strict attention to the burden-\n\nshifting framework, focusing instead on whether the evidence as a\n\nwhole is sufficient to make out a question for a factfinder as to\n\npretext and discriminatory animus.\"        Fennell, 83 F.3d at 535.\n\n            Defendants have, in fact, identified numerous clear,\n\nspecific reasons for the adverse employment actions taken against\n\nCalero having nothing to do with any impulse to retaliate against\n\nher for protected conduct.       The troubling history of plaintiff's\n\ninsubordinate and disruptive behavior and the occasions when she\n\nfailed to perform her duties in a satisfactory manner all provided\n\nlegitimate justification for disciplinary action entirely untainted\n\nby retaliatory animus.         That plaintiff may point to this same\n\nevidence in support of her Rehabilitation Act claim does not\n\ndiminish the significance of these shortcomings as legitimate bases\n\n\n                                   -38-\n\ffor discipline.        The analytical matrix is different for the two\n\nstatutes, and evidence that may assist a plaintiff's case from one\n\nvantage may damage it from another.           Since Calero has failed to\n\npoint to specific facts that would demonstrate any sham or pretext\n\nintended to cover up defendants’ retaliatory motive, we will affirm\n\nthe dismissal of her retaliation claim under Title VII.\n\n                               V. Conclusion\n\n           The precedential value of this decision may be limited,\n\nto some extent, by its unusual circumstances:         the confused state\n\nof the record, plaintiff's pro se status, and the failure of\n\nappellees' counsel to address in any way the central issues raised\n\nby the appeal.    In any event, we are unable to say with confidence\n\nthat no reasonable factfinder, taking the facts from this record as\n\nplaintiff might present them, could return a favorable verdict on\n\nthe Rehabilitation Act claim.        For this reason, we must conclude\n\nthat the district court's allowance of defendants' motion for\n\nsummary judgment on this count was in error. We therefore REVERSE\n\nAND   VACATE     the     district   court's    judgment   regarding   the\n\nRehabilitation Act and REMAND for further proceedings consistent\n\nwith this opinion.        In all other respects, the judgment of the\n\ndistrict court is AFFIRMED.\n\n          Costs are assessed against the appellees.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -39-\n\f",

Amended complaints followed in May 2000 and May 2002. Perhaps because plaintiff was representing herself, the precise causes of action were rather hard to discern from the pleadings. Plaintiff now asserts that, while she may have included additional theories in her administrative proceedings, her complaint and amended complaints as submitted to the district court were intended to encompass only two claims: (1) a claim for failure to accommodate her disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12101 <i>et seq.,</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and the Rehabilitation Act, and (2) a claim for retaliation under Title VII, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e <i>et seq.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eventually the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, and on September 18, 2002, the district court issued its opinion granting the defendants' motion and denying the plaintiff's. In his memorandum, the district court judge conscientiously addressed all causes of action that might reasonably have been inferred from the plaintiff's less than artfully drafted pleadings, including claims for discrimination based on gender, national origin and age, which the plaintiff has not pursued, as well as the claims for failure to accommodate and for retaliation, which the plaintiff has continued to press on this appeal. Specifically, with regard to plaintiff's claim for failure to accommodate her disability, the district court suggested, first, that \"depression <i>per se</i>\" is not a recognized disability, then went on to conclude that, in any event, the record conclusively indicated that plaintiff could not perform the legitimate requirements of her position, and moreover that plaintiff's requested accommodation was not feasible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 15, 2002, Calero filed her Notice of Appeal, challenging only the district court's rulings regarding her claims for failure to accommodate and for retaliation. Despite clear notification of the scope of this appeal, and further confirmation in the appellant's brief, appellees' counsel has inexplicably treated this appeal as though it involved merely a garden variety claim of discrimination under Title VII. No significant discussion whatever addresses Calero's claim &#8212; the heart of her case &#8212; that the defendants failed to make any reasonable effort to accommodate her disability. This neglect has played a substantial part in the court's decision to remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recount the facts in the light most favorable to Calero, the party opposing summary judgment. <i>Motorsport Eng'g, Inc. v. Maserati SPA,</i> 316 F.3d 26, 28 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Calero began practicing law in 1977 in Puerto Rico's Department of Justice. Later, she worked for private firms and agencies in Puerto Rico, and, from 1993 to 1995, in East Hartford, Connecticut with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In 1995, Calero was hired as an assistant district counsel in the New York District Office of the INS' Office of the General Counsel (\"OGC\"). Her performance was rated \"excellent\" in her 1996-97 appraisal, and in May 1997 Calero successfully petitioned for a transfer to the San Juan District Office of the OGC, where she began working part-time as an assistant district counsel. Nothing in the record suggests that Calero, up to this point in her twenty-year career as an attorney, had ever encountered significant difficulties in performing her job at or above the level of her employers' expectations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the summer of 1997, Calero began to suffer from tension headaches and lethargy, the first sign of the onset of a disability that was soon to erode her capacity to function without accommodation. On January 16, 1998, Dr. Roberto Rodriguez (\"Dr.Rodriguez\") diagnosed Calero with a recurrence of depression and prescribed the antidepressant Paxil. Calero had suffered previously from depression, in 1990 when her mother and father died and again in 1992 upon the death of her brother. The record does not suggest, however, that at these earlier times her depression interfered with her capacity to work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1998, Calero began working full-time at the San Juan District Office. One month later, and two months following her diagnosis of depression, Calero's emotional fragility catapulted her into the first of a series of acrimonious episodes with her supervisor Vivian Reyes-Lopez (\"Reyes\"). Before summarizing the evidence related to these incidents, two observations about the state of the record are appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, in recounting her conflicts with Reyes, plaintiff's <i>pro se</i> papers sometimes appear to suggest that Calero's problems at work derived not from a failure to accommodate her disability, but simply from Reyes' general unfairness to her. To the extent Calero might succeed in placing blame for her problems at work on Reyes personally, she may vindicate her own virtue but doom her case. The Rehabilitation Act is not, of course, designed to provide a worker a remedy against an arbitrary supervisor, <i>per se.</i> It is designed to insure that a capable, disabled worker, covered by the statute, is not deprived of the opportunity to work and earn a living due to the refusal of the employer to make a reasonable accommodation. Viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, therefore, the summary below will concentrate on facts that a reasonable factfinder might find supportive of this statutory claim, and not on Calero's occasional self-justifying suggestions that it was Reyes, not she, who was responsible for their ongoing problems.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, we are aware in recounting this background that a reasonable factfinder might conclude that Calero's friction with her supervisor (and, as will be seen, others including family and friends) <i>might</i> be explained on the ground that she was simply a very difficult, not a disabled, person. In the context of summary judgment, however, we must respect the role of the factfinder to choose between alternative, reasonably supported inferences. Since the factual mosaic, seen from plaintiff's perspective, might reasonably support a claim of disability, we summarize the facts in a manner consistent with that viewpoint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first episode of what was to be a lengthy series of problems between Calero and Reyes arose over what should have been a trivial matter. On March 9, 1998, Reyes denied Calero's request to make up a lost work hour during lunchtime. In response, Calero complained in a loud voice that Reyes was the worst supervisor she ever had and that Reyes treated her like a child. The outburst was vociferous enough to be overheard by other INS staff in the office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following day, March 10, 1998, Reyes asked Calero to come to her office to discuss the previous day's contretemps. At the meeting, Reyes told Calero that raising her voice in the office was not necessary. Calero responded with a further verbal attack, criticizing Reyes' supervisory skills, telling Reyes that she had a bad attitude, and suggesting that Reyes had lost an appointment as an immigration judge because of her poor professional ability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A week later, on March 17, 1999, Calero consulted Dr. Filia S. Garcia, who referred Calero to a psychologist for evaluation of her \"masked depression.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 18, 1998, Calero received a formal reprimand (a so-called memorandum of \"admonishment\") from Reyes for her behavior on March 9th and 10th.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The day following her receipt of this reprimand, Calero sent an e-mail message to Jack Penca (\"Penca\"), the Regional District Counsel and Reyes' immediate supervisor, who worked out of the Vermont office of the INS, regarding the recent friction with Reyes. Calero complained to Penca that Reyes was harassing her and that this daily harassment was affecting her emotionally. Calero informed Penca that she was taking the antidepressant Paxil \"to be able to continue working.\" This was the first time Calero informed a supervisor that she was suffering from depression and was on medication for her condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In mid-April 1998, Calero was seen by psychiatrist Dr. Margarita Alonso Cedo (\"Dr. Alonso\"). On April 13th, Calero's condition was serious enough that Dr. Alonso recommended to Calero that she take a medical leave from work for the next three weeks. On April 17, 1998, Dr. Alonso diagnosed Calero with \"major depression\" and, like Dr. Rodriguez in January 1998, prescribed the antidepressant Paxil.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Significantly, Dr. Alonso also wrote a note to Calero's employer giving notice of Calero's condition and confirming her recommendation that Calero take a three-week break from work. After receiving two doctors' notes from Dr. Alonso explaining Calero's diagnosis, medication and plan for treatment, Reyes approved Calero's sick leave, which lasted from April 14 to May 1, 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 21, 1998, Calero contacted the Office of Equal Employment Opportunity, Immigration and Naturalization Service, U.S. Department of Justice (\"EEO\") in Washington, D.C. to inquire about filing a complaint for discrimination and harassment. On April 22, 1998, Calero contacted Dr. Ruth Prevor (\"Dr. Prevor\"), a psychologist with the INS Employee Assistance Office. Thereafter, Calero met with Dr. Prevor on several occasions to receive assistance regarding her mental disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also on April 22nd, while Calero was on medical leave, Reyes left Calero two memoranda instructing Calero to complete certain tasks in preparation for her upcoming annual vacation. Reyes asked Calero to review her cases scheduled for hearings in the immigration court during her vacation and also to prepare a particular case to be discussed with Reyes before the vacation's starting date, which was May 22, 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 7, 1998, after Calero returned from her medical leave but before she left for her annual vacation, Calero and Reyes met to discuss Calero's cases. Reyes had previously requested that Calero copy her on certain e-mail messages, and Calero again entered into a nasty argument with Reyes, this time about Reyes' concern that Calero was failing to follow Reyes' instructions. Calero told Reyes during this conversation that Reyes was reprimanding her as a mother might scold a child and treating her unfairly. At the end of the meeting, Calero asked, with heavy sarcasm, \"Is that all Vivian? Can I leave now?\" Later, when Reyes approached Calero's desk and asked her why she had again failed to copy her on an e-mail as requested, Calero became furious and told Reyes to stop scolding her, that she was not a child and Reyes was not her mother. Bizarrely, Calero began calling Reyes \"mother\" and \"mommy,\" refused to provide Reyes an explanation of why she did not copy Reyes on e-mail messages as Reyes had instructed, and repeated, \"Don't punish me, stop punishing me.\" Again, this strange and confrontational behavior was observed by other INS employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not surprisingly, Reyes reported Calero's conduct to Penca. Her memo summarized the May 7th incident and recommended that disciplinary action be taken against Calero. Reyes indicated that Calero was a \"disruptive element\" and recommended that Calero either be dismissed or transferred out of the San Juan District office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 11, 1998, Calero mailed Penca a copy of her EEO complaint, and informed him that she had been getting counseling from the EEO office of the INS and that she was submitting the complaint to her EEO counselor. Penca subsequently forwarded a copy of the complaint to Reyes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 22, 1998, Calero went on her scheduled two-week annual leave, returning to work on June 2, 1998. Before she left Calero failed to prepare her cases properly, as Reyes had instructed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 26, 1998, Reyes sent a memorandum to Penca detailing Calero's failure to review her files, as requested. Reyes noted that, in order to prepare the cases with hearings scheduled during the two weeks Calero was out, she and another OGC attorney had been required to work ten hours of overtime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 22, 1998, Penca sent Calero a Notice of Proposed Ten Day Suspension (\"Notice\"). The two grounds for this suspension were: (1) Calero's disrespectful behavior toward Reyes on May 7, 1998, and (2) Calero's disregard of Reyes' instruction to prepare her cases before going on leave. Calero submitted a 35-page reply in opposition to this Notice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 23, 1998, Calero received her performance appraisal for July 1, 1997, through June 30, 1998. Calero received a \"minimally satisfactory\" rating in the category of \"Advocates for/Represents the Agency\" but was given ratings of \"fully successful\" in categories of \"Provides Legal Advice\" and \"Conducts Legal Research and Writing.\" Her formal rating, overall, was \"fully successful.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite these rather positive ratings, Calero received several negative comments in her review. For example, the review noted that Calero failed to prepare several of her cases for hearings, that she failed to inform her supervisor of the status of her cases and that she required substantial supervision. Despite her titularly satisfactory ratings, Calero viewed this as the first negative review that she had received during her employment with the INS.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 24, 1998, Dr. Alonso again recommended that Calero take a few days off from work to rest, and Calero did so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the rest, it was clear by the middle of the summer that Calero's depression was infecting her relations with persons other than her supervisor. In a memo dated August 12, 1998, Reyes noted Calero's excessive and unwarranted criticism of other attorneys, evident in the e-mails she was sending to lawyers outside the office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 17, 1998, at Dr. Alonso's recommendation, Calero was \"partially\" hospitalized for ten days due to her depression.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> In addition, side effects from the antidepressant medication were troubling Calero to the extent that Dr. Alonso changed her prescription.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following her partial hospitalization, on September 1, 1998, Calero sent an e-mail entitled \"transfer on detail\" to Paul Virtue, General Counsel, INS (\"Virtue\"), with a copy to David Dixon, Deputy General Counsel, INS (\"Dixon\"). Calero informed Virtue and Dixon that she had been suffering from major depression since April 13, 1998, and that she was being discriminated against and harassed by her supervisors, Reyes and Penca. She noted, among other things, INS' duty to consider a reasonable accommodation that would allow her to perform her job. As her own suggestion for an accommodation, she requested a temporary assignment (a so called \"detail\") out of her current work site, to the INS office at the San Juan International Airport.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The September 1, 1998, e-mail was the first of what would be many explicit requests for some sort of an accommodation, or at least a dialogue concerning accommodation, to permit plaintiff to continue working while she received treatment for her major depression. The specific accommodation proposed by Calero &#8212; temporary assignment to the San Juan airport &#8212; may perhaps have presented certain practical problems for the INS. The record is not clear on this point, and, again, the appellees' failure to offer any discussion on the issue has handcuffed the court. It is clear, however, that Calero's employer made no effort to offer any realistic alternative accommodation, or even to discuss the difficulties that plaintiff's major depression was creating for her at work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 4, 1998, Calero once again sent an e-mail notification to Virtue, with a copy to Dixon, to the effect that the lack of any response by the INS to her complaints was causing a deterioration of her physical and emotional health, and that she was requesting an alternative assignment as a reasonable accommodation for her disability of depression.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 8, 1998, a simmering problem related to Calero's apparent tape recording in the office boiled over. In June of 1998, some co-workers of Calero's had told Reyes that they thought that Calero was taping their conversations. In response, Reyes sent out an e-mail reminding all staff that surreptitious tape recording of conversations was impermissible, against INS policy, and could result in discipline. On September 8th, a staff member told Reyes that she observed Calero using a tape recorder while talking with Reyes. Reyes approached Calero, obtained the recorder after some argument and found that, indeed, the tape contained a recording of her conversation. When Reyes told Calero she was going to take the tape, Calero screamed at her and tried to block the doorway. After she managed to make her exit, Reyes turned the tape over to the local FBI office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some months later, in a letter to Penca, dated January 20, 1999, Calero claimed that someone in the office had been attempting to tape her conversations without her knowledge in order to \"frame\" her. She asserted that she taped Reyes inadvertently, unaware that the tape recorder was turned on.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 14, 1998, after the screaming incident over the tape recorder, Dr. Alonso recommended that Calero take a medical leave from work for two weeks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 7, 1998, Dixon suspended Calero for five days for disrespectful behavior toward her supervisor and for failure to follow orders. Dixon based his decision on Penca's Notice of Proposed Action issued on June 22, 1998, Calero's response, and Reyes' memorandum of admonishment of March 18, 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later in October, Calero e-mailed Virtue a third time and again requested a temporary assignment to the INS Airport office in San Juan. Once more, she received no response.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 30, 1998, when a new attorney was being hired in the office, Reyes contacted Calero and gave her the choice of either accepting replacement furniture for her office and keeping her office, or keeping her newer furniture and turning her office over to the new attorney. Calero chose to keep her newer furniture and was moved to a less desirable work area, described by Calero as a \"grot.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 2, 1998, Dr. Alonso observed, in a handwritten note on a prescription pad, that Calero should be transferred to a different workplace in Puerto Rico so that \"she could benefit from continued treatment, decreased stressful situations and family support.\" It is not clear whether this notation reached the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following day, Calero faxed Virtue her fourth request for an accommodation. She detailed the medical treatment she was receiving, described the discrimination and harassment she perceived herself as suffering and emphasized her concern that her depression was affecting her job performance. Significantly, Calero disclosed to Virtue that her problems went beyond her relationship with Reyes:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Due to the depression, I have detached myself from my family and friends, who have been very worry [sic] about me and had been reaching me and giving me support. My social life had been extremely limited.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this November 3, 1998, letter, Calero again asked for a transfer to the San Juan International Airport office. Again, the INS made no response.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 9, 1998, Dr. Alonso made another recommendation that Calero absent herself from work in order to rest for the remainder of the week. Three days later, Calero made yet another request to be transferred to the San Juan International Airport office in a letter to Virtue. At the end of that month, Dr. Alonso recommended Calero rest from work for ten days starting November 27, 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 9, 1998, Reyes issued a Notice of a Proposal of Suspension of Calero for fourteen days for (1) failure to follow orders by surreptitiously tape-recording conversations in the office on September 8, 1998; (2) failure to follow orders by refusing to update Reyes on a particular case; and (3) failure to be forthright with a supervisor by taping conversations in the office and then denying doing so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 15, 1998, Michael Coaster, a Division Chief with the INS' Office of the General Counsel (\"Coaster\"), denied Calero's requests for an accommodation. His letter stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You wrote that you are depressed because \"of the discrimination and harassment based on sex and national origin that (you) have endured within the INS San Juan District Office.\" This is not a disability as defined by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. As such, the agency is not under an obligation to provide you with an accommodation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This letter made no mention of the medical evidence submitted by Calero confirming her major depression. The Coaster letter did indicate that the INS had at some unspecified time offered to consider reassigning Calero to an existing vacant position outside Puerto Rico, but that Calero had rejected this offer because she did not want to leave Puerto Rico. Except for this reference in the Coaster letter, no documentation exists in the record memorializing this supposed offer to transfer Calero. No details specify the location or nature of the new position, the timing of the supposed transfer, or the identity and authority of the person making the offer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 4, 1999, Calero filed her second EEO complaint alleging discrimination based on gender, national origin, age, mental and physical disability, and retaliation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 16, 1999, Penca found the second ground of Reyes' Proposed Suspension of December to be supported by a preponderance of the evidence. Penca determined that disciplinary action for Calero's failure to follow orders in reporting to Reyes the status of a case was warranted and imposed a ten day suspension without pay on February 16, 1999. In response, Calero filed several complaints with law enforcement agencies calling for an investigation of the supposed illegal tape-recording of <i>her</i> conversations by coworkers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 6, 1999, Reyes reminded Calero that she was late for an appearance before an immigration judge. In response Calero falsely denied that she was late. It later emerged that the judge had been kept waiting because of Calero's tardiness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early May 1999, Calero was involved in yet another unseemly office incident. Calero told a student-employee, Lenga Siberon (\"Siberon\"), to be on guard for \"illegal things\" that Reyes might ask her to do. Siberon replied that she was not doing anything illegal. In a written statement provided to Reyes, Siberon reported that she felt \"intimidated and somewhat threatened\" by Calero.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 4, 1999, a second disturbing incident involving Calero and a different student-employee occurred. The student, Carmen Ortiz (\"Ortiz\"), did not interrupt a meeting to give Calero two telephone messages from Calero's son. Calero exploded at Ortiz for not giving her the messages immediately, screaming at the young woman and berating her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 11, 1999, Calero's counsel, Miriam Ramos Grateroles, faxed a letter to Doris Meissner, the Commissioner of the INS. Calero's counsel requested that Calero be given a reasonable accommodation in accordance with the Rehabilitation Act and that she be transferred to the Airport office. She also wrote that the conduct and behavior of Reyes was the principal factor underlying Calero's major depression and that some separation from Reyes and the environment at the San Juan office would allow Calero to continue to work despite her disability. Calero's counsel also included a note from Dr. Alonso, which reported that Calero was having difficulty interacting with family and friends due to her depression. The doctor recommended that any transfer of Calero be within Puerto Rico, so that Calero could receive needed family and community support to the extent possible during her illness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At work, plaintiff's behavioral manifestations of her severe depression continued. During the spring and summer of 1999, Reyes reported to Penca that Calero was at various times \"agitated,\" \"out of control,\" \"impossible to work with,\" \"bizarre,\" and \"a constant source of aggravation.\" On July 9, 1999, during a discussion of a scheduling conflict, Calero repeatedly stated in a loud voice, in the presence of two other employees, that Reyes was harassing her on a daily basis, and that her absences were due to Reyes' constant humiliation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final blow-up between Calero and Reyes occurred four days later. Again, the trigger for the eruption should have been a routine matter. Reyes instructed Calero to leave for court so that she would be on time. In a raised voice, Calero called Reyes a liar and stated that Penca and Reyes had made false accusations against her and fabricated evidence against her. Once again, other employees were in the area and overheard the contentious exchange between the two.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following day, July 14, 1999, Reyes placed Calero on paid administrative leave, where she remained until her termination the following May.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 3, 2000, Bo Cooper, General Counsel of the INS, issued a Notice of Proposed Removal to Calero. The Notice was based on four specific grounds: (1) making statements to a co-worker that advocated the mistrust of a mutual supervisor and resulted in anxiety in the workplace; (2) disruptive behavior; (3) conduct unbecoming a Service attorney; and (4) disrespectful behavior towards a supervisor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 4, 2000, Marc Salans (\"Salans\"), Assistant Director of the Office of Attorney Personnel Management of the Department of Justice, found Calero's removal warranted and made her termination effective as of May 19, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's ruling on cross-motions for summary judgment <i>de novo. See Bienkowski v. Northeastern Univ.,</i> 285 F.3d 138, 140 (1st Cir.2002); <i>Wightman v. Springfield Terminal Ry. Co.,</i> 100 F.3d 228, 230 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Summary judgment is appropriate when \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to a material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). A \"genuine\" issue is one that could be resolved in favor of either party, and a \"material fact\" is one that has the potential of affecting the outcome of the case. <i>See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,</i> 477 U.S. 242, 248-50, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the moving party has asserted that no genuine issue of material fact exists, the burden is on the opposing party to point to specific facts demonstrating that there is, indeed, a trialworthy issue. <i>Nat'l Amusements, Inc. v. Town of Dedham,</i> 43 F.3d 731, 735 (1st Cir.1995). Not every genuine factual conflict, of course, necessitates a trial. \"It is only when a disputed fact has the potential to change the outcome of the suit under the governing law if found favorably to the nonmovant that the materiality hurdle is cleared.\" <i>Parrilla-Burgos v.

R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.,</i> 896 F.2d 5, 9 n. 3 (1st Cir.1990). In this case, as noted, the record as a whole presents many inconsistencies, displaying perspectives that favor in some lights the defendants and in others the plaintiff. So long as the plaintiff's evidence is both cognizable and sufficiently strong to support a verdict in her favor, the factfinder must be allowed to determine which version of the facts is most compelling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two issues are in play in this appeal: first, whether on the record a reasonable factfinder might conclude that the defendants violated the Rehabilitation Act by failing to offer Calero a reasonable accommodation for her disability; second, whether a factfinder might reasonably find that the defendants violated Title VII by retaliating against Calero for asserting her rights. We begin with the claim under the Rehabilitation Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Discrimination Based on Disability</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ADA and Rehabilitation Act prohibit discrimination against an otherwise qualified individual based on his or her disability. The Rehabilitation Act, the precursor to the ADA, applies to federal agencies, contractors and recipients of federal financial assistance, while the ADA applies to private employers with over 15 employees and state and local governments. Although, as noted <i>supra</i> n. 1, the ADA does not apply here, the case law construing the ADA generally pertains equally to claims under the Rehabilitation Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The federal statutes barring discrimination based on disability do more than merely prohibit disparate treatment; they also impose an affirmative duty on employers to offer a \"reasonable accommodation\" to a disabled employee. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12112(b)(5)(A). <i>Garc&#237;a-Ayala v. Lederle Parenterals, Inc.,</i> 212 F.3d 638, 646 n. 9 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To assert a claim for failure to accommodate under the Rehabilitation Act, Calero would have to establish the following: (1) that she suffered from a \"disability\" within the meaning of the statute; (2) that she was a qualified individual in that she was able to perform the essential functions of her job, either with or without a reasonable accommodation; and (3) that, despite her employer's knowledge of her disability, the employer did not offer a reasonable accommodation for the disability. <i>See Carroll v. Xerox Corp.,</i> 294 F.3d 231, 237 (1st Cir.2002); <i>Higgins v. New Balance Athletic Shoe, Inc.,</i> 194 F.3d 252, 264 (1st Cir.1999). We will address each of these three elements separately.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Disability</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ADA defines \"disability\" as either (a) a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of an individual's major life activities; (b) a record of such impairment; or (c) being regarded as having such an impairment. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12102(2); <i>see also</i> 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(g). Here, plaintiff contends, under subsection (a), that she actually suffered a mental impairment that limited one or more of her major life activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well established that the determination of whether a plaintiff has a disability must be made on a case-by-case basis. <i>See Toyota Motor Mfg., Ky., Inc. v. Williams,</i> 534 U.S. 184, 198, 122 S.Ct. 681, 151 L.Ed.2d 615 (2002); <i>Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc.,</i> 527 U.S. 471, 483, 119 S.Ct. 2139, 144 L.Ed.2d 450 (1999). The analysis leading to this determination requires the court to consider the record in the light of three questions. First, did the plaintiff suffer a physical or mental impairment? Second, did the \"life activity\" limited by the impairment qualify as \"major\"? Finally, did the impairment, in fact, <i>substantially</i> limit the plaintiff's identified major life activity? <i>See Bragdon v. Abbott,</i> 524 U.S. 624, 630-31, 118 S.Ct. 2196, 141 L.Ed.2d 540 (1998). The burden is on the plaintiff to establish these three elements. <i>See Bailey v. Georgia-Pacific Corp.,</i> 306 F.3d 1162, 1167 (1st Cir.2002); <i>Carroll,</i> 294 F.3d at 238. We now take up these three inquiries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. <i>Did the Plaintiff Suffer a Mental Impairment?</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The answer to the first question, on the facts of this case, is obviously in the affirmative. This circuit has recognized depression as a mental impairment that may constitute, at least in some circumstances, a disability under federal law. <i>See Criado v. IBM Corp.,</i> 145 F.3d 437, 442 (1st Cir. 1998). A number of other circuits have also recognized depression as a qualifying mental impairment. <i>See, e.g., Ogborn v. United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Union, Local No. 881,</i> 305 F.3d 763, 767 (7th Cir.2002) (\"Major depression can constitute a disability under the ADA.\"); <i>Snead v. Metro. Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co.,</i> 237 F.3d 1080, 1088 n. 8 (9th Cir.2001) (\"In Oregon, stress and depression can be considered mental impairments. The same is true under the ADA.\"); <i>Pritchard v. Southern Co. Servs.,</i> 92 F.3d 1130, 1132 (11th Cir. 1996), <i>amended in part on reh'g,</i> 102 F.3d 1118, <i>cert. denied,</i> 520 U.S. 1274, 117 S.Ct. 2453, 138 L.Ed.2d 211 (1997) (\"Depression has been held to constitute a mental impairment.\"); <i>Doe v. Region 13 Mental Health-Mental Retardation Comm'n.,</i> 704 F.2d 1402, 1408 (5th Cir.1983) (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the record in this case provides more than sufficient evidence to permit a factfinder to conclude that the plaintiff, in fact, was suffering from major depression during the relevant period. The record confirms Calero's prior history of depression, her diagnosis of depression by at least two physicians, her antidepressant medication, her numerous required medical leaves from work, and her partial hospitalization. In sum, as a matter of law and of fact, the record clearly favors the plaintiff on the first of the three pertinent questions. A factfinder could easily determine that she suffered a qualified mental impairment. To determine whether the record would support a finding that plaintiff suffered a disability, we now turn to the next question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. <i>Did the Plaintiff's Mental Impairment Limit a \"Major\" Life Activity?</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Calero has highlighted numerous life activities that she says were limited by her depression: sleeping, eating, learning, concentrating, thinking, working and interacting with others. A \"major life activity\" is an activity of central importance to people's daily lives. <i>Toyota Motor,</i> 534 U.S. at 197, 122 S.Ct. 681. Many of the activities cited by the plaintiff have been recognized, by this court or others, as \"major,\" including sleeping and eating, <i>Criado,</i> 145 F.3d at 442-43; <i>Lawson v. CSX Transp., Inc.,</i> 245 F.3d 916, 923 (7th Cir.2001), learning, <i>Bercovitch v. Baldwin Sch., Inc.,</i> 133 F.3d 141, 155 (1st Cir.1998), and thinking and concentrating, <i>Whitney v. Greenberg, Rosenblatt, Kull &amp; Bitsoli, P.C.,</i> 258 F.3d 30, 33 n. 4 (1st Cir.2001). The Supreme Court has assumed, without deciding, that working itself may be considered a major life activity for purposes of the ADA. <i>Sutton,</i> 527 U.S. at 492, 119 S.Ct. 2139. Likewise, this court has on occasion assumed <i>arguendo</i> that working might be deemed a major life activity under the Rehabilitation Act. <i>See, e.g., Bailey,</i> 306 F.3d at 1168 n. 5; <i>Carroll,</i> 294 F.3d at 239; <i>Gelabert-Ladenheim v. American Airlines, Inc.,</i> 252 F.3d 54, 58 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In granting summary judgment for the defendant, the district court did not take issue with plaintiff's claim that her disability interfered with one or more of these recognized major life activities. Moreover, as noted, the appellees' brief has offered us not a word of discussion on the issue. In view of the documented severity of plaintiff's disability, we assume that the defendants concede, at least for purposes of summary judgment, that it interfered with one or more of the major life activities specified by Calero.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. <i>Was the Major Life Activity \"Substantially\" Limited?</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is a simple matter to find sufficient evidence in the record that Calero's mental impairment did \"substantially\" limit a major life activity. Although the federal statutes do not explicitly define the phrase \"substantially limits,\" in <i>Sutton</i> the Supreme Court instructed that the phrase \"suggests `considerable' or `specified to a large degree.'\" <i>Sutton,</i> 527 U.S. at 491, 119 S.Ct. 2139. Even so, \"while substantial limitations should be considerable, they also should not be equated with `utter inabilities.'\" <i>Taylor v. Phoenixville Sch. Dist.,</i> 184 F.3d 296, 307 (3d Cir.1999). The Supreme Court has stated that \"[w]hen significant limitations result from an impairment, the disability definition is met even if the difficulties are not unsurmountable.\" <i>Bragdon,</i> 524 U.S. at 641, 118 S.Ct. 2196. An impairment can substantially limit a major life activity, even though the plaintiff is still able to engage in the activity to some extent. <i>See Gillen v. Fallon Ambulance Serv., Inc.,</i> 283 F.3d 11, 22 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As before, neither the district court nor the appellees here have contested Calero's assertion that her major depression <i>substantially</i> limited one or more of her recognized major life activities. Given this, we must conclude by default that the evidence was sufficient to satisfy the first element of Calero's Rehabilitation Act claim; she did suffer a \"disability.\" The next question is whether she was a \"qualified individual.\" Was she able to perform the essential functions of her job, with or without an accommodation?</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Qualified Individual</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be a \"qualified individual\" under the Rehabilitation Act, a plaintiff must show first that she possesses the requisite skill, experience, education and other job-related requirements for the position and, second, that she is able to perform the essential functions of the position with or without a reasonable accommodation. <i>Garc&#237;a-Ayala,</i> 212 F.3d at 646.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An \"essential function\" is a fundamental job duty associated with a particular position; this function can extend beyond \"`an employee's technical skills and experience, even including such individual or idiosyncratic characteristics as scheduling flexibility.'\" <i>Ward,</i> 209 F.3d at 34 (quoting <i>Laurin v. Providence Hosp.,</i> 150 F.3d 52, 59 n. 6 (1st Cir.1998)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the evidence shows that Calero was an experienced trial attorney. She practiced law for over twenty years and had two successful years of prior experience in this same position in the INS' New York Office. She received above average to excellent performance reviews through June 30, 1998. Based on this, a factfinder might easily find that she possessed the requisite skill and experience for the position of Assistant District Counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A much closer question is whether a reasonable factfinder could conclude that Calero, while suffering the powerful effects of her disability, still possessed the ability to function competently and productively in the workplace, either without any modification of her work situation or with a reasonable accommodation. After all, an employee who is unable to control her bizarre and disruptive behavior may be unfit for employment, no matter how advanced her objective skills or how extensive her experience. Although appellees' brief ignores the issue entirely, the district court anchored its summary judgment ruling, in part, on its conclusion that the record indisputably confirmed plaintiff's inability to perform her job at an acceptable level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A plaintiff offering a claim under the Rehabilitation Act confronts a potential \"Catch-22\" when arguing that she is a qualified individual under the Act. She must show both that her impairment substantially limits a major life activity and that she is \"otherwise qualified\" for her job, meaning she is able to perform the essential functions her position requires, or would be if reasonably accommodated. In shorthand, the law requires the individual to be both substantially limited and reasonably functional. Several authors have discussed this quandary. <i>E.g.,</i> Jonathan Brown, <i>Defining Disability in 2001: A Lower Court Odyssey,</i> 23 WHITTIER L.REV. 335, 381-85 (2001); Chai R. Feldblum, <i>Definition of Disability under Federal Anti-Discrimination Law: What Happened?</i> <i>Why? And What Can We Do About It?;</i> 21 BERKELEY J. EMP. &amp; LAB. L. 91, 160-61 (2000); Randal I. Goldstein, Note, <i>Mental Illness in the Workplace after Sutton v. United Airlines,</i> 86 CORNELL L.REV. 927, 944 (2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court need not explore the nuances of this interesting conundrum, since the record in this case is adequate to generate an issue for consideration by a factfinder regarding plaintiff's capacity to perform her job, even while suffering her major depression, at least with an appropriate accommodation. The defendants' own evaluation, issued less than a year before plaintiff ceased working for the INS and several months <i>after</i> Calero's attack of depression, gave Calero a job rating, not merely of average, but of \"fully successful.\" In other words, despite some flaws and problems, the INS pronounced itself fully satisfied with Calero's level of performance even while she suffered from her major depression. Contrary facts produced at a trial may very well put in play the question of Calero's capacity to perform, but this documentation alone entitles the plaintiff to consideration by a factfinder of the second element of her claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To satisfy the third and final element of her Rehabilitation Act claim, plaintiff must prove that her employer, having knowledge of her disability, failed to offer her a reasonable accommodation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Reasonable Accommodation</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If an employer, aware of an employee's disability, refuses to provide a requested reasonable accommodation, the employer violates the Rehabilitation Act, unless it can show that the proposed accommodation would pose an undue hardship for its business. <i>See Higgins,</i> 194 F.3d at 264.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reasonable accommodations may include \"job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position ... and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12111(9)(B). A careful, individualized review of an accommodation request in light of the specific facts of the case is needed to determine whether the request was reasonable. <i>Garc&#237;a-Ayala,</i> 212 F.3d at 647.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To show that a proposed accommodation was reasonable, a plaintiff must prove \"not only that the proposed accommodation would enable her to perform the essential functions of her job, but also that, at least on the face of things, it is feasible for the employer under the circumstances.\" <i>Reed v. LePage Bakeries, Inc.,</i> 244 F.3d 254, 259 (1st Cir.2001). The request for accommodation must be \"`sufficiently direct and specific,' giving notice that she needs a `special accommodation.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 261 (quoting <i>Wynne v. Tufts Univ.,</i> 976 F.2d 791, 795 (1st Cir.1992)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the plaintiff offers proof that a sufficiently specific request was made, the defendant may attempt to prove that, in fact, the proposed accommodation was not feasible and would constitute an \"undue\" hardship. <i>Id.</i> An adequately supported denial of an accommodation request requires the employer \"to produce at least some modicum of evidence showing that the [requested accommodation] would be a hardship, financial or otherwise.\" <i>Ward,</i> 209 F.3d at 37.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In some cases, a request for a reasonable accommodation may trigger a responsibility on the part of the employer to enter into an interactive process with the employee to determine an appropriate accommodation. <i>Reed,</i> 244 F.3d at 262 n. 11. The ADA's regulations state that \"it may be necessary for the covered entity to initiate an informal, interactive process with the qualified individual.\" 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(<i>o</i>)(3). The scope of the employer's obligation in this process is not crystal clear, but \"[t]he employer has at least some responsibility in determining the necessary accommodation,\" since \"the regulations envision an interactive process that requires participation by both parties.\" 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(<i>o</i>)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As this court has noted, this interactive process \"requires a great deal of communication between the employee and employer.\" <i>Garc&#237;a-Ayala,</i> 212 F.3d at 648 n. 12, <i>citing Criado,</i> 145 F.3d at 444.

Univ. of Wis. Bd. of Regents,</i> 75 F.3d 1130, 1135 (7th Cir.1996) (\"A party that obstructs or delays the interactive process is not acting in good faith. A party that fails to communicate, by way of initiation or response, may also be acting in bad faith. In essence, courts should attempt to isolate the cause of the breakdown and then assign responsibility.\"); <i>Taylor v. Principal Fin. Group, Inc.,</i> 93 F.3d 155, 165 (5th Cir. 1996) (\"[O]nce an accommodation is properly requested, the responsibility for fashioning a reasonable accommodation is shared between the employee and employer. Thus, it is the employee's initial request for accommodation which triggers the employer's obligation to participate in the interactive process of determining one.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewing the facts of this case in the light of these principles, and faced yet again with an utter lack of argument on this point by appellees' counsel, the court must conclude that the evidence regarding reasonable accommodation, while conflicting, is sufficient to generate an issue for a factfinder when viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. First, Calero requested an accommodation on at least six occasions, specifically identifying a transfer as an acceptable form of accommodation. Second, Calero's supervisor, Reyes &#8212; usually her adversary &#8212; seconded Calero's request by suggesting the transfer herself. Third, on the record as it stands, a factfinder could find that Calero's suggestion of a transfer to a work site at the San Juan airport was \"at least on the face of things\" feasible. Fourth, a factfinder could also find that the defendants failed to offer a sufficient \"modicum of evidence\" showing that the accommodation proposed by plaintiff would constitute a hardship.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Fifth, even if the proposed accommodation might in some way have been less than ideal from defendants' viewpoint &#8212; for reasons not articulated anywhere in the record &#8212; a factfinder could well find that the defendants failed to engage in any good faith interactive process to explore whether some variant of the plaintiff's proposal might have been workable. Indeed, a factfinder might well conclude that, in the face of plaintiff's increasingly desperate requests for an accommodation, the defendants simply stonewalled &#8212; going so far as to deny, in the face of substantial medical evidence, that plaintiff suffered a disability at all. Finally, to the extent that the record hints that the defendants, at some unspecified point and in some unspecified way, offered a transfer out of Puerto Rico as an accommodation (and the record supplies only a wisp of indirect evidence on this point), a factfinder could well conclude that the offer was either grossly inappropriate, given plaintiff's medical condition, or lacking in good faith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the record offers sufficient evidence from which a factfinder could conclude that the defendants, being aware of plaintiff's disability and of her request for accommodation, failed to make a reasonable response. Given that the record contains evidence that, if believed by a factfinder, might have proved (1) that Calero did suffer from a disability within the meaning of the statute, (2) that she was a qualified individual who was able to perform the functions of her job, and (3) that her employer failed to reasonably accommodate her disability, plaintiff was entitled to present her Rehabilitation Act claim to a factfinder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Title VII Retaliation Claim</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prove a claim of retaliation, a plaintiff must establish that (1) she engaged in protected conduct; (2) she experienced an adverse employment action; and (3) there was a causal connection between the protected conduct and the adverse employment action. <i>See Gu v. Boston Police Dep't.,</i> 312 F.3d 6, 14 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held that Calero did prove the first two elements of her retaliation claim. She did engage in protected activity by filing her two complaints with the INS' EEO office, and she was subjected to adverse employment actions. However, the court held that the evidence was insufficient, even viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, to prove a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Calero relies primarily on the timing of the employment actions as her primary evidence of causal connection. The Supreme Court has stated that \"[t]he cases that accept mere temporal proximity between an employer's knowledge of protected activity and an adverse employment action as sufficient evidence of causality to establish a prima facie case uniformly hold that the temporal proximity must be `very close.'\" <i>Clark County Sch. Dist. v. Breeden,</i> 532 U.S. 268, 273-74, 121 S.Ct. 1508, 149 L.Ed.2d 509 (2001) (citation omitted). Three and four month periods have been held insufficient to establish a causal connection based on temporal proximity. <i>See Richmond v. ONEOK, Inc.,</i> 120 F.3d 205, 209 (10th Cir.1997); <i>Hughes v. Derwinski,</i> 967 F.2d 1168, 1174-75 (7th Cir.1992). We have held that \"a showing of discharge soon after the employee engages in an activity specifically protected by ... Title VII ... is indirect proof of a causal connection between the firing and the activity because it is strongly suggestive of retaliation.\" <i>Oliver v. Digital Equip. Corp.,</i> 846 F.2d 103, 110 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts demonstrate sufficient temporal proximity between the protected conduct and the employment action in this case to make out a prima facie case. On March 18, 1998, Calero received the memorandum of admonishment, the first adverse employment action. On April 21, 1998, Calero first contacted the EEO Office. On May 11, 1998, Calero filed her first EEO complaint. Calero sent Penca a copy of this complaint, and Penca in turn, forwarded the complaint to Reyes. We have noted that the prima facie burden in this context is not an onerous one. <i>Fennell v. First Step Designs, Ltd.,</i> 83 F.3d 526, 535-36 (1st Cir.1996). As plaintiff received her first proposed suspension on June 22, 1998, roughly a month after she made defendants aware that she filed her EEO complaint, we find plaintiff has met her burden of making out a prima facie case of retaliation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the plaintiff has made a prima facie showing of retaliation, the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> burden-shifting approach is employed, and defendant must articulate a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for its employment decision. If the defendant meets this burden, the plaintiff must now show that the proffered legitimate reason is in fact a pretext and that the job action was the result of the defendant's retaliatory animus. <i>See St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks,</i> 509 U.S. 502, 510-11, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993). We have noted the manner in which courts should consider the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> analysis in the context of summary judgment: \"[O]n summary judgment, the need to order the presentation of proof is largely obviated, and a court may often dispense with strict attention to the burden-shifting framework, focusing instead on whether the evidence as a whole is sufficient to make out a question for a factfinder as to pretext and discriminatory animus.\" <i>Fennell,</i> 83 F.3d at 535.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants have, in fact, identified numerous clear, specific reasons for the adverse employment actions taken against Calero having nothing to do with any impulse to retaliate against her for protected conduct. The troubling history of plaintiff's insubordinate and disruptive behavior and the occasions when she failed to perform her duties in a satisfactory manner all provided legitimate justification for disciplinary action entirely untainted by retaliatory animus. That plaintiff may point to this same evidence in support of her Rehabilitation Act claim does not diminish the significance of these shortcomings as legitimate bases for discipline. The analytical matrix is different for the two statutes, and evidence that may assist a plaintiff's case from one vantage may damage it from another. Since Calero has failed to point to specific facts that would demonstrate any sham or pretext intended to cover up defendants' retaliatory motive, we will affirm the dismissal of her retaliation claim under Title VII.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The precedential value of this decision may be limited, to some extent, by its unusual circumstances: the confused state of the record, plaintiff's <i>pro se</i> status, and the failure of appellees' counsel to address in any way the central issues raised by the appeal. In any event, we are unable to say with confidence that <i>no</i> reasonable factfinder, taking the facts from this record as plaintiff might present them, could return a favorable verdict on the Rehabilitation Act claim. For this reason, we must conclude that the district court's allowance of defendants' motion for summary judgment on this count was in error. We therefore REVERSE AND VACATE the district court's judgment regarding the Rehabilitation Act and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. In all other respects, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Costs are assessed against the appellees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> This opinion will concentrate almost entirely on the Rehabilitation Act, since the ADA is not available to federal employees<i>Rivera v.

The trial judge, grappling with claims under several statutes, granted summary judgment for defendants on all the plaintiff's causes of action. Because we find that the record, viewed in the light most favorable to the appellant, might support a claim under the Rehabilitation Act, and (equally importantly) that appellees' counsel has entirely failed to address either the facts or the law buttressing this claim, we are constrained to reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Procedural Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A brief review of the procedural history of this case will serve to put the issues in context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After pursuing administrative remedies starting in 1998, plaintiff-appellant, Sylvia I. Calero-Cerezo (\"Calero\"), an attorney employed by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") proceeding <i>pro se,</i> filed her complaint in the United States District Court on October 4, 1999. The defendants were the United States Department of Justice (\"DOJ\"), the INS, then-Attorney General Janet Reno, and then-Commissioner of the INS Doris Meissner. Amended complaints followed in May 2000 and May 2002. Perhaps because plaintiff was representing herself, the precise causes of action were rather hard to discern from the pleadings. Plaintiff now asserts that, while she may have included additional theories in her administrative proceedings, her complaint and amended complaints as submitted to the district court were intended to encompass only two claims: (1) a claim for failure to accommodate her disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12101 <i>et seq.,</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and the Rehabilitation Act, and (2) a claim for retaliation under Title VII, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e <i>et seq.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eventually the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, and on September 18, 2002, the district court issued its opinion granting the defendants' motion and denying the plaintiff's. In his memorandum, the district court judge conscientiously addressed all causes of action that might reasonably have been inferred from the plaintiff's less than artfully drafted pleadings, including claims for discrimination based on gender, national origin and age, which the plaintiff has not pursued, as well as the claims for failure to accommodate and for retaliation, which the plaintiff has continued to press on this appeal. Specifically, with regard to plaintiff's claim for failure to accommodate her disability, the district court suggested, first, that \"depression <i>per se</i>\" is not a recognized disability, then went on to conclude that, in any event, the record conclusively indicated that plaintiff could not perform the legitimate requirements of her position, and moreover that plaintiff's requested accommodation was not feasible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 15, 2002, Calero filed her Notice of Appeal, challenging only the district court's rulings regarding her claims for failure to accommodate and for retaliation. Despite clear notification of the scope of this appeal, and further confirmation in the appellant's brief, appellees' counsel has inexplicably treated this appeal as though it involved merely a garden variety claim of discrimination under Title VII. No significant discussion whatever addresses Calero's claim &#8212; the heart of her case &#8212; that the defendants failed to make any reasonable effort to accommodate her disability. This neglect has played a substantial part in the court's decision to remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recount the facts in the light most favorable to Calero, the party opposing summary judgment. <i>Motorsport Eng'g, Inc. v. Maserati SPA,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780477\"><a href=\"/opinion/780477/motorsport-engineering-inc-dba-majestic-cars-ltd-v-maserati-spa/\"><span class=\"volume\">316</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 28 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Calero began practicing law in 1977 in Puerto Rico's Department of Justice. Later, she worked for private firms and agencies in Puerto Rico, and, from 1993 to 1995, in East Hartford, Connecticut with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In 1995, Calero was hired as an assistant district counsel in the New York District Office of the INS' Office of the General Counsel (\"OGC\"). Her performance was rated \"excellent\" in her 1996-97 appraisal, and in May 1997 Calero successfully petitioned for a transfer to the San Juan District Office of the OGC, where she began working part-time as an assistant district counsel. Nothing in the record suggests that Calero, up to this point in her twenty-year career as an attorney, had ever encountered significant difficulties in performing her job at or above the level of her employers' expectations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the summer of 1997, Calero began to suffer from tension headaches and lethargy, the first sign of the onset of a disability that was soon to erode her capacity to function without accommodation. On January 16, 1998, Dr. Roberto Rodriguez (\"Dr.Rodriguez\") diagnosed Calero with a recurrence of depression and prescribed the antidepressant Paxil. Calero had suffered previously from depression, in 1990 when her mother and father died and again in 1992 upon the death of her brother. The record does not suggest, however, that at these earlier times her depression interfered with her capacity to work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1998, Calero began working full-time at the San Juan District Office. One month later, and two months following her diagnosis of depression, Calero's emotional fragility catapulted her into the first of a series of acrimonious episodes with her supervisor Vivian Reyes-Lopez (\"Reyes\"). Before summarizing the evidence related to these incidents, two observations about the state of the record are appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, in recounting her conflicts with Reyes, plaintiff's <i>pro se</i> papers sometimes appear to suggest that Calero's problems at work derived not from a failure to accommodate her disability, but simply from Reyes' general unfairness to her. To the extent Calero might succeed in placing blame for her problems at work on Reyes personally, she may vindicate her own virtue but doom her case. The Rehabilitation Act is not, of course, designed to provide a worker a remedy against an arbitrary supervisor, <i>per se.</i> It is designed to insure that a capable, disabled worker, covered by the statute, is not deprived of the opportunity to work and earn a living due to the refusal of the employer to make a reasonable accommodation. Viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, therefore, the summary below will concentrate on facts that a reasonable factfinder might find supportive of this statutory claim, and not on Calero's occasional self-justifying suggestions that it was Reyes, not she, who was responsible for their ongoing problems.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, we are aware in recounting this background that a reasonable factfinder might conclude that Calero's friction with her supervisor (and, as will be seen, others including family and friends) <i>might</i> be explained on the ground that she was simply a very difficult, not a disabled, person. In the context of summary judgment, however, we must respect the role of the factfinder to choose between alternative, reasonably supported inferences. Since the factual mosaic, seen from plaintiff's perspective, might reasonably support a claim of disability, we summarize the facts in a manner consistent with that viewpoint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first episode of what was to be a lengthy series of problems between Calero and Reyes arose over what should have been a trivial matter. On March 9, 1998, Reyes denied Calero's request to make up a lost work hour during lunchtime. In response, Calero complained in a loud voice that Reyes was the worst supervisor she ever had and that Reyes treated her like a child. The outburst was vociferous enough to be overheard by other INS staff in the office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following day, March 10, 1998, Reyes asked Calero to come to her office to discuss the previous day's contretemps. At the meeting, Reyes told Calero that raising her voice in the office was not necessary. Calero responded with a further verbal attack, criticizing Reyes' supervisory skills, telling Reyes that she had a bad attitude, and suggesting that Reyes had lost an appointment as an immigration judge because of her poor professional ability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A week later, on March 17, 1999, Calero consulted Dr. Filia S. Garcia, who referred Calero to a psychologist for evaluation of her \"masked depression.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 18, 1998, Calero received a formal reprimand (a so-called memorandum of \"admonishment\") from Reyes for her behavior on March 9th and 10th.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The day following her receipt of this reprimand, Calero sent an e-mail message to Jack Penca (\"Penca\"), the Regional District Counsel and Reyes' immediate supervisor, who worked out of the Vermont office of the INS, regarding the recent friction with Reyes. Calero complained to Penca that Reyes was harassing her and that this daily harassment was affecting her emotionally. Calero informed Penca that she was taking the antidepressant Paxil \"to be able to continue working.\" This was the first time Calero informed a supervisor that she was suffering from depression and was on medication for her condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In mid-April 1998, Calero was seen by psychiatrist Dr. Margarita Alonso Cedo (\"Dr. Alonso\"). On April 13th, Calero's condition was serious enough that Dr. Alonso recommended to Calero that she take a medical leave from work for the next three weeks. On April 17, 1998, Dr. Alonso diagnosed Calero with \"major depression\" and, like Dr. Rodriguez in January 1998, prescribed the antidepressant Paxil.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Significantly, Dr. Alonso also wrote a note to Calero's employer giving notice of Calero's condition and confirming her recommendation that Calero take a three-week break from work. After receiving two doctors' notes from Dr. Alonso explaining Calero's diagnosis, medication and plan for treatment, Reyes approved Calero's sick leave, which lasted from April 14 to May 1, 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 21, 1998, Calero contacted the Office of Equal Employment Opportunity, Immigration and Naturalization Service, U.S. Department of Justice (\"EEO\") in Washington, D.C. to inquire about filing a complaint for discrimination and harassment. On April 22, 1998, Calero contacted Dr. Ruth Prevor (\"Dr. Prevor\"), a psychologist with the INS Employee Assistance Office. Thereafter, Calero met with Dr. Prevor on several occasions to receive assistance regarding her mental disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also on April 22nd, while Calero was on medical leave, Reyes left Calero two memoranda instructing Calero to complete certain tasks in preparation for her upcoming annual vacation. Reyes asked Calero to review her cases scheduled for hearings in the immigration court during her vacation and also to prepare a particular case to be discussed with Reyes before the vacation's starting date, which was May 22, 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 7, 1998, after Calero returned from her medical leave but before she left for her annual vacation, Calero and Reyes met to discuss Calero's cases. Reyes had previously requested that Calero copy her on certain e-mail messages, and Calero again entered into a nasty argument with Reyes, this time about Reyes' concern that Calero was failing to follow Reyes' instructions. Calero told Reyes during this conversation that Reyes was reprimanding her as a mother might scold a child and treating her unfairly. At the end of the meeting, Calero asked, with heavy sarcasm, \"Is that all Vivian? Can I leave now?\" Later, when Reyes approached Calero's desk and asked her why she had again failed to copy her on an e-mail as requested, Calero became furious and told Reyes to stop scolding her, that she was not a child and Reyes was not her mother. Bizarrely, Calero began calling Reyes \"mother\" and \"mommy,\" refused to provide Reyes an explanation of why she did not copy Reyes on e-mail messages as Reyes had instructed, and repeated, \"Don't punish me, stop punishing me.\" Again, this strange and confrontational behavior was observed by other INS employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not surprisingly, Reyes reported Calero's conduct to Penca. Her memo summarized the May 7th incident and recommended that disciplinary action be taken against Calero. Reyes indicated that Calero was a \"disruptive element\" and recommended that Calero either be dismissed or transferred out of the San Juan District office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 11, 1998, Calero mailed Penca a copy of her EEO complaint, and informed him that she had been getting counseling from the EEO office of the INS and that she was submitting the complaint to her EEO counselor. Penca subsequently forwarded a copy of the complaint to Reyes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 22, 1998, Calero went on her scheduled two-week annual leave, returning to work on June 2, 1998. Before she left Calero failed to prepare her cases properly, as Reyes had instructed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 26, 1998, Reyes sent a memorandum to Penca detailing Calero's failure to review her files, as requested. Reyes noted that, in order to prepare the cases with hearings scheduled during the two weeks Calero was out, she and another OGC attorney had been required to work ten hours of overtime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 22, 1998, Penca sent Calero a Notice of Proposed Ten Day Suspension (\"Notice\"). The two grounds for this suspension were: (1) Calero's disrespectful behavior toward Reyes on May 7, 1998, and (2) Calero's disregard of Reyes' instruction to prepare her cases before going on leave. Calero submitted a 35-page reply in opposition to this Notice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 23, 1998, Calero received her performance appraisal for July 1, 1997, through June 30, 1998. Calero received a \"minimally satisfactory\" rating in the category of \"Advocates for/Represents the Agency\" but was given ratings of \"fully successful\" in categories of \"Provides Legal Advice\" and \"Conducts Legal Research and Writing.\" Her formal rating, overall, was \"fully successful.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite these rather positive ratings, Calero received several negative comments in her review. For example, the review noted that Calero failed to prepare several of her cases for hearings, that she failed to inform her supervisor of the status of her cases and that she required substantial supervision. Despite her titularly satisfactory ratings, Calero viewed this as the first negative review that she had received during her employment with the INS.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 24, 1998, Dr. Alonso again recommended that Calero take a few days off from work to rest, and Calero did so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the rest, it was clear by the middle of the summer that Calero's depression was infecting her relations with persons other than her supervisor. In a memo dated August 12, 1998, Reyes noted Calero's excessive and unwarranted criticism of other attorneys, evident in the e-mails she was sending to lawyers outside the office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 17, 1998, at Dr. Alonso's recommendation, Calero was \"partially\" hospitalized for ten days due to her depression.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> In addition, side effects from the antidepressant medication were troubling Calero to the extent that Dr. Alonso changed her prescription.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following her partial hospitalization, on September 1, 1998, Calero sent an e-mail entitled \"transfer on detail\" to Paul Virtue, General Counsel, INS (\"Virtue\"), with a copy to David Dixon, Deputy General Counsel, INS (\"Dixon\"). Calero informed Virtue and Dixon that she had been suffering from major depression since April 13, 1998, and that she was being discriminated against and harassed by her supervisors, Reyes and Penca. She noted, among other things, INS' duty to consider a reasonable accommodation that would allow her to perform her job. As her own suggestion for an accommodation, she requested a temporary assignment (a so called \"detail\") out of her current work site, to the INS office at the San Juan International Airport.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The September 1, 1998, e-mail was the first of what would be many explicit requests for some sort of an accommodation, or at least a dialogue concerning accommodation, to permit plaintiff to continue working while she received treatment for her major depression. The specific accommodation proposed by Calero &#8212; temporary assignment to the San Juan airport &#8212; may perhaps have presented certain practical problems for the INS. The record is not clear on this point, and, again, the appellees' failure to offer any discussion on the issue has handcuffed the court. It is clear, however, that Calero's employer made no effort to offer any realistic alternative accommodation, or even to discuss the difficulties that plaintiff's major depression was creating for her at work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 4, 1998, Calero once again sent an e-mail notification to Virtue, with a copy to Dixon, to the effect that the lack of any response by the INS to her complaints was causing a deterioration of her physical and emotional health, and that she was requesting an alternative assignment as a reasonable accommodation for her disability of depression.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 8, 1998, a simmering problem related to Calero's apparent tape recording in the office boiled over. In June of 1998, some co-workers of Calero's had told Reyes that they thought that Calero was taping their conversations. In response, Reyes sent out an e-mail reminding all staff that surreptitious tape recording of conversations was impermissible, against INS policy, and could result in discipline. On September 8th, a staff member told Reyes that she observed Calero using a tape recorder while talking with Reyes. Reyes approached Calero, obtained the recorder after some argument and found that, indeed, the tape contained a recording of her conversation. When Reyes told Calero she was going to take the tape, Calero screamed at her and tried to block the doorway. After she managed to make her exit, Reyes turned the tape over to the local FBI office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some months later, in a letter to Penca, dated January 20, 1999, Calero claimed that someone in the office had been attempting to tape her conversations without her knowledge in order to \"frame\" her. She asserted that she taped Reyes inadvertently, unaware that the tape recorder was turned on.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 14, 1998, after the screaming incident over the tape recorder, Dr. Alonso recommended that Calero take a medical leave from work for two weeks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 7, 1998, Dixon suspended Calero for five days for disrespectful behavior toward her supervisor and for failure to follow orders. Dixon based his decision on Penca's Notice of Proposed Action issued on June 22, 1998, Calero's response, and Reyes' memorandum of admonishment of March 18, 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later in October, Calero e-mailed Virtue a third time and again requested a temporary assignment to the INS Airport office in San Juan. Once more, she received no response.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 30, 1998, when a new attorney was being hired in the office, Reyes contacted Calero and gave her the choice of either accepting replacement furniture for her office and keeping her office, or keeping her newer furniture and turning her office over to the new attorney. Calero chose to keep her newer furniture and was moved to a less desirable work area, described by Calero as a \"grot.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 2, 1998, Dr. Alonso observed, in a handwritten note on a prescription pad, that Calero should be transferred to a different workplace in Puerto Rico so that \"she could benefit from continued treatment, decreased stressful situations and family support.\" It is not clear whether this notation reached the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following day, Calero faxed Virtue her fourth request for an accommodation. She detailed the medical treatment she was receiving, described the discrimination and harassment she perceived herself as suffering and emphasized her concern that her depression was affecting her job performance. Significantly, Calero disclosed to Virtue that her problems went beyond her relationship with Reyes:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Due to the depression, I have detached myself from my family and friends, who have been very worry [sic] about me and had been reaching me and giving me support. My social life had been extremely limited.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this November 3, 1998, letter, Calero again asked for a transfer to the San Juan International Airport office. Again, the INS made no response.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 9, 1998, Dr. Alonso made another recommendation that Calero absent herself from work in order to rest for the remainder of the week. Three days later, Calero made yet another request to be transferred to the San Juan International Airport office in a letter to Virtue. At the end of that month, Dr. Alonso recommended Calero rest from work for ten days starting November 27, 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 9, 1998, Reyes issued a Notice of a Proposal of Suspension of Calero for fourteen days for (1) failure to follow orders by surreptitiously tape-recording conversations in the office on September 8, 1998; (2) failure to follow orders by refusing to update Reyes on a particular case; and (3) failure to be forthright with a supervisor by taping conversations in the office and then denying doing so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 15, 1998, Michael Coaster, a Division Chief with the INS' Office of the General Counsel (\"Coaster\"), denied Calero's requests for an accommodation. His letter stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You wrote that you are depressed because \"of the discrimination and harassment based on sex and national origin that (you) have endured within the INS San Juan District Office.\" This is not a disability as defined by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. As such, the agency is not under an obligation to provide you with an accommodation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This letter made no mention of the medical evidence submitted by Calero confirming her major depression. The Coaster letter did indicate that the INS had at some unspecified time offered to consider reassigning Calero to an existing vacant position outside Puerto Rico, but that Calero had rejected this offer because she did not want to leave Puerto Rico. Except for this reference in the Coaster letter, no documentation exists in the record memorializing this supposed offer to transfer Calero. No details specify the location or nature of the new position, the timing of the supposed transfer, or the identity and authority of the person making the offer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 4, 1999, Calero filed her second EEO complaint alleging discrimination based on gender, national origin, age, mental and physical disability, and retaliation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 16, 1999, Penca found the second ground of Reyes' Proposed Suspension of December to be supported by a preponderance of the evidence. Penca determined that disciplinary action for Calero's failure to follow orders in reporting to Reyes the status of a case was warranted and imposed a ten day suspension without pay on February 16, 1999. In response, Calero filed several complaints with law enforcement agencies calling for an investigation of the supposed illegal tape-recording of <i>her</i> conversations by coworkers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 6, 1999, Reyes reminded Calero that she was late for an appearance before an immigration judge. In response Calero falsely denied that she was late. It later emerged that the judge had been kept waiting because of Calero's tardiness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early May 1999, Calero was involved in yet another unseemly office incident. Calero told a student-employee, Lenga Siberon (\"Siberon\"), to be on guard for \"illegal things\" that Reyes might ask her to do. Siberon replied that she was not doing anything illegal. In a written statement provided to Reyes, Siberon reported that she felt \"intimidated and somewhat threatened\" by Calero.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 4, 1999, a second disturbing incident involving Calero and a different student-employee occurred. The student, Carmen Ortiz (\"Ortiz\"), did not interrupt a meeting to give Calero two telephone messages from Calero's son. Calero exploded at Ortiz for not giving her the messages immediately, screaming at the young woman and berating her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 11, 1999, Calero's counsel, Miriam Ramos Grateroles, faxed a letter to Doris Meissner, the Commissioner of the INS. Calero's counsel requested that Calero be given a reasonable accommodation in accordance with the Rehabilitation Act and that she be transferred to the Airport office. She also wrote that the conduct and behavior of Reyes was the principal factor underlying Calero's major depression and that some separation from Reyes and the environment at the San Juan office would allow Calero to continue to work despite her disability. Calero's counsel also included a note from Dr. Alonso, which reported that Calero was having difficulty interacting with family and friends due to her depression. The doctor recommended that any transfer of Calero be within Puerto Rico, so that Calero could receive needed family and community support to the extent possible during her illness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At work, plaintiff's behavioral manifestations of her severe depression continued. During the spring and summer of 1999, Reyes reported to Penca that Calero was at various times \"agitated,\" \"out of control,\" \"impossible to work with,\" \"bizarre,\" and \"a constant source of aggravation.\" On July 9, 1999, during a discussion of a scheduling conflict, Calero repeatedly stated in a loud voice, in the presence of two other employees, that Reyes was harassing her on a daily basis, and that her absences were due to Reyes' constant humiliation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final blow-up between Calero and Reyes occurred four days later. Again, the trigger for the eruption should have been a routine matter. Reyes instructed Calero to leave for court so that she would be on time. In a raised voice, Calero called Reyes a liar and stated that Penca and Reyes had made false accusations against her and fabricated evidence against her. Once again, other employees were in the area and overheard the contentious exchange between the two.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following day, July 14, 1999, Reyes placed Calero on paid administrative leave, where she remained until her termination the following May.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 3, 2000, Bo Cooper, General Counsel of the INS, issued a Notice of Proposed Removal to Calero. The Notice was based on four specific grounds: (1) making statements to a co-worker that advocated the mistrust of a mutual supervisor and resulted in anxiety in the workplace; (2) disruptive behavior; (3) conduct unbecoming a Service attorney; and (4) disrespectful behavior towards a supervisor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 4, 2000, Marc Salans (\"Salans\"), Assistant Director of the Office of Attorney Personnel Management of the Department of Justice, found Calero's removal warranted and made her termination effective as of May 19, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.

The record confirms Calero's prior history of depression, her diagnosis of depression by at least two physicians, her antidepressant medication, her numerous required medical leaves from work, and her partial hospitalization. In sum, as a matter of law and of fact, the record clearly favors the plaintiff on the first of the three pertinent questions. A factfinder could easily determine that she suffered a qualified mental impairment. To determine whether the record would support a finding that plaintiff suffered a disability, we now turn to the next question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. <i>Did the Plaintiff's Mental Impairment Limit a \"Major\" Life Activity?</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Calero has highlighted numerous life activities that she says were limited by her depression: sleeping, eating, learning, concentrating, thinking, working and interacting with others. A \"major life activity\" is an activity of central importance to people's daily lives. <i>Toyota Motor,</i> 534 U.S. at 197, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118470\"><a href=\"/opinion/118470/toyota-motor-mfg-ky-inc-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Likewise, this court has on occasion assumed <i>arguendo</i> that working might be deemed a major life activity under the Rehabilitation Act. <i>See, e.g., Bailey,</i> 306 F.3d at 1168 n. 5; <i>Carroll,</i> 294 F.3d at 239; <i>Gelabert-Ladenheim v.

Moreover, as noted, the appellees' brief has offered us not a word of discussion on the issue. In view of the documented severity of plaintiff's disability, we assume that the defendants concede, at least for purposes of summary judgment, that it interfered with one or more of the major life activities specified by Calero.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. <i>Was the Major Life Activity \"Substantially\" Limited?</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is a simple matter to find sufficient evidence in the record that Calero's mental impairment did \"substantially\" limit a major life activity. Although the federal statutes do not explicitly define the phrase \"substantially limits,\" in <i>Sutton</i> the Supreme Court instructed that the phrase \"suggests `considerable' or `specified to a large degree.'\" <i>Sutton,</i> 527 U.S. at 491, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118311\"><a href=\"/opinion/118311/sutton-v-united-air-lines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

An impairment can substantially limit a major life activity, even though the plaintiff is still able to engage in the activity to some extent. <i>See Gillen v.

Given this, we must conclude by default that the evidence was sufficient to satisfy the first element of Calero's Rehabilitation Act claim; she did suffer a \"disability.\" The next question is whether she was a \"qualified individual.\" Was she able to perform the essential functions of her job, with or without an accommodation?</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Qualified Individual</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be a \"qualified individual\" under the Rehabilitation Act, a plaintiff must show first that she possesses the requisite skill, experience, education and other job-related requirements for the position and, second, that she is able to perform the essential functions of the position with or without a reasonable accommodation. <i>Garc&#237;a-Ayala,</i> 212 F.3d at 646.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An \"essential function\" is a fundamental job duty associated with a particular position; this function can extend beyond \"`an employee's technical skills and experience, even including such individual or idiosyncratic characteristics as scheduling flexibility.'\" <i>Ward,</i> 209 F.3d at 34 (quoting <i>Laurin v.

She practiced law for over twenty years and had two successful years of prior experience in this same position in the INS' New York Office. She received above average to excellent performance reviews through June 30, 1998. Based on this, a factfinder might easily find that she possessed the requisite skill and experience for the position of Assistant District Counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A much closer question is whether a reasonable factfinder could conclude that Calero, while suffering the powerful effects of her disability, still possessed the ability to function competently and productively in the workplace, either without any modification of her work situation or with a reasonable accommodation. After all, an employee who is unable to control her bizarre and disruptive behavior may be unfit for employment, no matter how advanced her objective skills or how extensive her experience. Although appellees' brief ignores the issue entirely, the district court anchored its summary judgment ruling, in part, on its conclusion that the record indisputably confirmed plaintiff's inability to perform her job at an acceptable level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A plaintiff offering a claim under the Rehabilitation Act confronts a potential \"Catch-22\" when arguing that she is a qualified individual under the Act. She must show both that her impairment substantially limits a major life activity and that she is \"otherwise qualified\" for her job, meaning she is able to perform the essential functions her position requires, or would be if reasonably accommodated. In shorthand, the law requires the individual to be both substantially limited and reasonably functional. Several authors have discussed this quandary. <i>E.g.,</i> Jonathan Brown, <i>Defining Disability in 2001: A Lower Court Odyssey,</i> 23 WHITTIER L.REV. 335, 381-85 (2001); Chai R.

The defendants' own evaluation, issued less than a year before plaintiff ceased working for the INS and several months <i>after</i> Calero's attack of depression, gave Calero a job rating, not merely of average, but of \"fully successful.\" In other words, despite some flaws and problems, the INS pronounced itself fully satisfied with Calero's level of performance even while she suffered from her major depression. Contrary facts produced at a trial may very well put in play the question of Calero's capacity to perform, but this documentation alone entitles the plaintiff to consideration by a factfinder of the second element of her claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To satisfy the third and final element of her Rehabilitation Act claim, plaintiff must prove that her employer, having knowledge of her disability, failed to offer her a reasonable accommodation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Reasonable Accommodation</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If an employer, aware of an employee's disability, refuses to provide a requested reasonable accommodation, the employer violates the Rehabilitation Act, unless it can show that the proposed accommodation would pose an undue hardship for its business. <i>See Higgins,</i> 194 F.3d at 264.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reasonable accommodations may include \"job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position ... and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12111(9)(B).

First, Calero requested an accommodation on at least six occasions, specifically identifying a transfer as an acceptable form of accommodation. Second, Calero's supervisor, Reyes &#8212; usually her adversary &#8212; seconded Calero's request by suggesting the transfer herself. Third, on the record as it stands, a factfinder could find that Calero's suggestion of a transfer to a work site at the San Juan airport was \"at least on the face of things\" feasible. Fourth, a factfinder could also find that the defendants failed to offer a sufficient \"modicum of evidence\" showing that the accommodation proposed by plaintiff would constitute a hardship.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Fifth, even if the proposed accommodation might in some way have been less than ideal from defendants' viewpoint &#8212; for reasons not articulated anywhere in the record &#8212; a factfinder could well find that the defendants failed to engage in any good faith interactive process to explore whether some variant of the plaintiff's proposal might have been workable. Indeed, a factfinder might well conclude that, in the face of plaintiff's increasingly desperate requests for an accommodation, the defendants simply stonewalled &#8212; going so far as to deny, in the face of substantial medical evidence, that plaintiff suffered a disability at all. Finally, to the extent that the record hints that the defendants, at some unspecified point and in some unspecified way, offered a transfer out of Puerto Rico as an accommodation (and the record supplies only a wisp of indirect evidence on this point), a factfinder could well conclude that the offer was either grossly inappropriate, given plaintiff's medical condition, or lacking in good faith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the record offers sufficient evidence from which a factfinder could conclude that the defendants, being aware of plaintiff's disability and of her request for accommodation, failed to make a reasonable response. Given that the record contains evidence that, if believed by a factfinder, might have proved (1) that Calero did suffer from a disability within the meaning of the statute, (2) that she was a qualified individual who was able to perform the functions of her job, and (3) that her employer failed to reasonably accommodate her disability, plaintiff was entitled to present her Rehabilitation Act claim to a factfinder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Title VII Retaliation Claim</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prove a claim of retaliation, a plaintiff must establish that (1) she engaged in protected conduct; (2) she experienced an adverse employment action; and (3) there was a causal connection between the protected conduct and the adverse employment action. <i>See Gu v. Boston Police Dep't.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200231\"><a href=\"/opinion/200231/gu-v-boston-police-dept/\"><span class=\"volume\">312</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 14 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held that Calero did prove the first two elements of her retaliation claim. She did engage in protected activity by filing her two complaints with the INS' EEO office, and she was subjected to adverse employment actions. However, the court held that the evidence was insufficient, even viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, to prove a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Calero relies primarily on the timing of the employment actions as her primary evidence of causal connection. The Supreme Court has stated that \"[t]he cases that accept mere temporal proximity between an employer's knowledge of protected activity and an adverse employment action as sufficient evidence of causality to establish a prima facie case uniformly hold that the temporal proximity must be `very close.'\" <i>Clark County Sch.

Three and four month periods have been held insufficient to establish a causal connection based on temporal proximity. <i>See Richmond v.

We have held that \"a showing of discharge soon after the employee engages in an activity specifically protected by ... Title VII ... is indirect proof of a causal connection between the firing and the activity because it is strongly suggestive of retaliation.\" <i>Oliver v. Digital Equip. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"505831\"><a href=\"/opinion/505831/46-fair-emplpraccas-1535-46-empl-prac-dec-p-37989-norman-w-oliver/\"><span class=\"volume\">846</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></a></span>, 110 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts demonstrate sufficient temporal proximity between the protected conduct and the employment action in this case to make out a prima facie case. On March 18, 1998, Calero received the memorandum of admonishment, the first adverse employment action. On April 21, 1998, Calero first contacted the EEO Office. On May 11, 1998, Calero filed her first EEO complaint. Calero sent Penca a copy of this complaint, and Penca in turn, forwarded the complaint to Reyes. We have noted that the prima facie burden in this context is not an onerous one. <i>Fennell v. First Step Designs, Ltd.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"718191\"><a href=\"/opinion/718191/70-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1305-34-fedrserv3d-1566-rachel-l-fennell/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">526</span></a></span>, 535-36 (1st Cir.1996). As plaintiff received her first proposed suspension on June 22, 1998, roughly a month after she made defendants aware that she filed her EEO complaint, we find plaintiff has met her burden of making out a prima facie case of retaliation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the plaintiff has made a prima facie showing of retaliation, the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> burden-shifting approach is employed, and defendant must articulate a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for its employment decision. If the defendant meets this burden, the plaintiff must now show that the proffered legitimate reason is in fact a pretext and that the job action was the result of the defendant's retaliatory animus. <i>See St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112901\"><a href=\"/opinion/112901/st-marys-honor-center-v-hicks/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span>, 510-11, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112901\"><a href=\"/opinion/112901/st-marys-honor-center-v-hicks/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">407</span></a></span> (1993). We have noted the manner in which courts should consider the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> analysis in the context of summary judgment: \"[O]n summary judgment, the need to order the presentation of proof is largely obviated, and a court may often dispense with strict attention to the burden-shifting framework, focusing instead on whether the evidence as a whole is sufficient to make out a question for a factfinder as to pretext and discriminatory animus.\" <i>Fennell,</i> 83 F.3d at 535.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants have, in fact, identified numerous clear, specific reasons for the adverse employment actions taken against Calero having nothing to do with any impulse to retaliate against her for protected conduct. The troubling history of plaintiff's insubordinate and disruptive behavior and the occasions when she failed to perform her duties in a satisfactory manner all provided legitimate justification for disciplinary action entirely untainted by retaliatory animus. That plaintiff may point to this same evidence in support of her Rehabilitation Act claim does not diminish the significance of these shortcomings as legitimate bases for discipline. The analytical matrix is different for the two statutes, and evidence that may assist a plaintiff's case from one vantage may damage it from another. Since Calero has failed to point to specific facts that would demonstrate any sham or pretext intended to cover up defendants' retaliatory motive, we will affirm the dismissal of her retaliation claim under Title VII.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The precedential value of this decision may be limited, to some extent, by its unusual circumstances: the confused state of the record, plaintiff's <i>pro se</i> status, and the failure of appellees' counsel to address in any way the central issues raised by the appeal. In any event, we are unable to say with confidence that <i>no</i> reasonable factfinder, taking the facts from this record as plaintiff might present them, could return a favorable verdict on the Rehabilitation Act claim. For this reason, we must conclude that the district court's allowance of defendants' motion for summary judgment on this count was in error. We therefore REVERSE AND VACATE the district court's judgment regarding the Rehabilitation Act and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. In all other respects, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Costs are assessed against the appellees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> This opinion will concentrate almost entirely on the Rehabilitation Act, since the ADA is not available to federal employees<i>Rivera v.

The same standards, however, apply to claims under the ADA and under the Rehabilitation Act. <i>Oliveras-Sifre v.
