Though the referee's certificate states that there has been annexed as part of the certificate the referee's order denying the reclamation petition, and though the certificate also contains a statement that, 'No findings of fact additional to those contained in the order itself are made except as indicated below', nevertheless the referee's order has not been printed in the appellant's appendix for our consideration.  As the referee's certificate points out, 'the case is one of interpreting the nature of the transaction whereby the air conditioning equipment ended up in the hands of the bankrupt.  The referee concluded that the transaction was a sale and that title had therefore passed to the bankrupt, and the reclamation petition of the creditor was thus denied.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the circumstances we do not think it necessary for us to examine the original papers on file in our clerk's office, in order to strain to find some ground for reversing the order of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No doubt the agreement between appellant and the debtor called for the execution of a conditional sales contract after delivery of the equipment to the job site.  However, it is clear that no conditional sales contract was ever executed, although a cash down payment of $1,500 was received by the seller, and retained, and the equipment was delivered and installed at the job site.

The transaction appears to have been an unconditional sale upon the personal credit of the buyer.  Title passed to the bankrupt, and through him to the trustee in bankruptcy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A judgment will be entered affirming the order of the District Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
