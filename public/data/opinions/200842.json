Russoniello and\nCooley Godward LLP were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n                          February 4, 2004\n\f               LYNCH, Circuit Judge. William Thurston, a vice president\n\nof     Damon    Clinical    Testing    Laboratories,   Inc.,   appeals    his\n\nconviction for conspiring to defraud the Medicare program of over\n\nfive       million   dollars.1   The    charged   conspiracy   involved   the\n\nmanipulation of physicians into ordering unnecessary ferritin blood\n\ntests2 for Medicare beneficiaries in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371.\n\n               The essence of the scheme charged was that Damon, through\n\nThurston and others, bundled the ferritin blood test -- previously\n\nordered by doctors less than two percent of the time -- into a\n\npanel of blood tests known as the LabScan, which was ordered thirty\n\nto forty percent of the time.          When doctors or patients (instead of\n\ninsurers) paid for the bundled LabScan, Damon provided the ferritin\n\ntest for free, leading doctors to believe there was no extra charge\n\n\n       1\n       The original panel opinion in this case issued on August 4,\n2003. Thurston then filed a petition for rehearing challenging,\ninter alia, our holding that the district court erred in granting\na downward departure for good works. The Federal Defender Office\nand District of Massachusetts Criminal Justice Act Board filed an\namicus brief in support of Thurston's petition, arguing that the\npanel had misconstrued the de novo review provisions contained in\n§ 401 of the Prosecutorial Remedies and Tools Against the\nExploitation of Children Today Act of 2003 (PROTECT Act), Pub. L.\nNo. 108-21, 117 Stat. 650. We asked for the government's response,\nwhich we received on November 18, 2003.\n     The arguments persuaded the panel that certain revisions to\nthe original discussion of the effects of the PROTECT Act on\nThurston's good works departure were appropriate. Accordingly, we\nhave withdrawn our prior opinion and substituted this one. The\ndiscussion of the PROTECT Act is revised; the remaining portions of\nthe original opinion are essentially unchanged.\n       2\n       The ferritin iron test measures the number of atoms per\nmolecule of circulating ferritin. Ferritin is a binding protein\nthat delivers iron to iron storage cells.\n\n                                        -2-\n\ffor this test.     Doctors were not told that, when Medicare paid for\n\nthe bundled LabScan, Medicare was charged extra for the ferritin\n\ntest.    Indeed, both a letter and marketing materials indicated the\n\nadded ferritin test was \"free\"; that is, that there was no charge\n\nbeyond the standard LabScan charge.                 Those unnecessary ferritin\n\ntests were not free to Medicare.                 Damon charged Medicare roughly\n\n$21 per ferritin test on top of the approximately $24 charged for\n\nthe LabScan.     Nor were doctors told that the ferritin test could be\n\nordered separately; the test requisition form did not offer that\n\noption. The physicians, then, were induced to order and to certify\n\nas medically necessary a large number of ferritin tests that were\n\nnot medically necessary.\n\n             The government's theory was that Damon did this to offset\n\nMedicare's      1988   reduction      in    reimbursement      rates   of   sixteen\n\npercent, which was projected to cause Damon an estimated annual\n\nloss of $800,000 in revenues.          In just one of Thurston's labs, the\n\norders    for    ferritin     tests    were       expected    to   increase    from\n\napproximately three hundred per month to roughly ten thousand per\n\nmonth.     Thurston testified that he was innocent, and that he\n\nneither had knowledge of nor responsibility for key components of\n\nthe conspiracy.        The jury disagreed.\n\n             Although the sentencing guidelines called for a sentence\n\nof   sixty-three       to   seventy-eight         months,    the   district   court\n\nsentenced Thurston to only three months' imprisonment.                  It did so\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\fby granting a downward departure to \"correct\" a perceived disparity\n\nbetween a five-year sentence of imprisonment for Thurston and the\n\nsentence of three years' probation given to the company president,\n\nJoseph Isola,    who   had   pled   nolo      contendere    and   assisted   the\n\ngovernment. Its second ground for departure was its sense that the\n\ngood   works   Thurston   did    for    his    church    and   community     were\n\nextraordinary.\n\n           This sentence outraged the prosecutors, who appealed,\n\narguing that the district court lacked the power to depart downward\n\nfor any of the reasons it gave, and that, even if a departure were\n\nappropriate, the extent of the departure was excessive.                       The\n\ngovernment also appeals the district court's failure to impose a\n\nfine, on the basis that the sentencing guidelines, if not the\n\nstatute, mandated a fine.       Finally, the prosecution argues that if\n\nsome departure for good works was warranted, the district court was\n\nrequired to address an issue it avoided: the government's request\n\nfor an upward departure on the ground that Thurston had obstructed\n\njustice by committing perjury on the witness stand.\n\n           Thurston also appeals, arguing that the conviction must\n\nbe vacated because the prosecution was barred by the statute of\n\nlimitations, because he was entitled to a jury instruction and to\n\nacquittal on the basis that he reasonably interpreted the law to\n\nmean he could rely on the physicians' certifications of medical\n\nnecessity, and because of other errors.                 In addition, Thurston\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fargues that his sentence was too high because his base offense\n\nlevel calculation depended on an amount of loss, either actual or\n\nintended, that was unproven and excessive.             Thurston also defends\n\nthe downward departure.\n\n            Several important issues are raised by these appeals.\n\nThe government's appeal requires us to address the effect of the\n\nnew Prosecutorial Remedies and Tools Against the Exploitation of\n\nChildren Today Act of 2003 (PROTECT Act), Pub. L. No. 108-21, 117\n\nStat. 650,3 on the standard that the courts of appeals use to\n\nreview     downward    departure    decisions    by    district    judges     in\n\nsentencing, as well as the availability of a downward departure for\n\na record of good works under U.S.S.G. § 5H1.11.              Thurston's appeal\n\ninvites,    inter     alia,   clarification     of    the    defense   doctrine\n\nconcerning a defendant's reasonable interpretation of the law; the\n\nissue of when a statute of limitations defense must be raised; the\n\nramifications    of    a   trial   judge's   failure    to   respond   to   jury\n\ninstructions proposed by counsel; the evidence needed to show an\n\nintended loss; and the question whether fines are mandatory.\n\n            In the end we sustain the conviction but find that the\n\nsentence was in error.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      This Act is also known as the Amber Alert bill. It includes\nchanges put forward in the so-called Feeney Amendment, which\nappears as § 401 of the Act.\n\n                                      -5-\n\f                              I.   FACTS\n\n           We state the facts as the jury could reasonably have\n\nfound them, including a fair description of the defense evidence.\n\nA.   Background\n\n           Medicare provides certain medical services and care,\n\nincluding clinical laboratory testing services, to persons aged\n\nsixty-five and older and to persons with disabilities. At the time\n\nof the conspiracy, Medicare was administered by the Health Care\n\nFinancing Administration (HCFA), a division of the U.S. Department\n\nof Health and Human Services. HCFA in turn contracted with private\n\ninsurance companies (\"carriers\" and \"intermediaries\") to handle\n\nclaims for reimbursement to Medicare program beneficiaries.           By\n\nlaw, Medicare only reimburses clinical laboratory services if those\n\nservices were medically necessary for the treatment or diagnosis of\n\na beneficiary's illness or injury.         42 U.S.C. § 1395y(a)(1)(A)\n\n(2000); see also 42 C.F.R. § 424.10(a) (1988).          Medicare did not\n\ngenerally reimburse screening tests.         Medicare reimbursed one-\n\nhundred percent of the cost of necessary clinical blood tests.\n\n           Damon was, at the time, a Massachusetts corporation that\n\nprovided   clinical   laboratory   testing   services    to   physicians,\n\nhospitals, health maintenance organizations, and their patients\n\nnationwide.   Approximately thirty percent of Damon's revenues were\n\nfrom Medicare.    Damon owned and operated a national system of\n\nclinical laboratories, and Damon was an approved Medicare provider.\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fWhen Damon      billed    the    Medicare     program,   it   submitted       to   the\n\ncarriers a HCFA 1500 form saying that it certified the lab tests\n\nwere medically necessary.          Physicians did not see those bills.\n\n              Thurston served as Regional Vice President of Damon from\n\n1987 to 1990, and was responsible during all or part of this time\n\nfor Damon's regional laboratories in Newbury Park, California;\n\nPhoenix; Chicago; and San Francisco. His office was at the Newbury\n\nPark lab; he traveled to the other labs and was in regular phone\n\ncontact.       Thurston    was    promoted     to   Senior    Vice   President      of\n\nOperations in 1990.             Thereafter, he relocated to the company\n\nheadquarters in Needham, Massachusetts and supervised only the San\n\nFrancisco lab.      Another company purchased Damon in August 1993;\n\nThurston later switched employers and moved to Utah.\n\nB.    Theories of Prosecution and Defense\n\n              The government's theory was that the defendants tricked\n\ndoctors    into   ordering       medically    unnecessary     tests,    for    which\n\nMedicare paid.       Damon added little-used tests to more popular\n\npanels of tests; it then tricked doctors by concealing that the\n\npanels could be ordered without the added tests and that Medicare\n\nwas   being    charged    for     the   tests.      To   conceal     from   doctors\n\nthat Medicare was being charged, and to encourage doctors to order\n\nferritin tests regardless of medical necessity, the defendants\n\ncharged doctors and patients little or no extra fee for the added\n\ntests; provided literature saying that ferritin was provided free;\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fotherwise failed to disclose to doctors the cost to Medicare of the\n\nexpanded LabScan; and made it difficult to order the bundled test\n\nwithout ferritin.\n\n          The defense theories were that there was no conspiracy\n\nand, if there were, that Thurston was not a knowing participant.\n\nThe defense contended that Damon complied with existing Medicare\n\nregulations,    which      neither   prohibited   bundling   nor   imposed   a\n\nrequirement on the lab to disregard a physician's certification\n\nthat tests were medically necessary.         It further argued that even\n\nif Thurston's interpretation of the regulations was incorrect, it\n\nwas objectively reasonable, and so Thurston lacked the required\n\ncriminal intent.      Thurston's defense was also that any fraud was\n\ncarried out     by   his    subordinates,   without   his    knowledge.      He\n\ntestified that he did not instruct the labs to add ferritin; did\n\nnot authorize or condone any decision to forego a fee increase for\n\ndoctors or private-pay patients on the expanded LabScan; did not\n\ninstruct subordinates to conceal that doctors could order a LabScan\n\nwithout ferritin; and had nothing to do with requisition forms or\n\nparticular pieces of marketing literature.\n\nC.   Evidence of Conspiracy to Defraud\n\n           1.   Addition of Ferritin\n\n          In late 1987, HCFA announced that effective April 1,\n\n1988, Medicare would reduce by almost sixteen percent the fees paid\n\nto laboratories, including Damon, for providing clinical laboratory\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fservices to beneficiaries.        If Damon maintained its existing\n\npractices and fee structure, then Damon would lose $800,000 in\n\nrevenues during the first year alone, as Thurston knew.         Of that\n\namount, more than $500,000 of the annual losses would occur at\n\nThurston's four regional laboratories.\n\n            There    were   corporate    discussions,   which   included\n\nThurston, about how to offset this loss.       As a result, Damon added\n\nits ferritin test to the LabScan, a panel of more than a dozen\n\nblood chemistry tests performed by a single machine on one blood\n\nsample.     The ferritin test was performed on separate equipment.\n\nDamon bundled ferritin with the LabScan from 1988 to at least mid-\n\n1993.     The LabScan had been requested on at least thirty-five to\n\nforty percent of the orders submitted to Thurston's regional\n\nlaboratories.       By contrast, doctors rarely ordered the ferritin\n\ntest.     The general manager of one of the laboratories Thurston\n\noversaw estimated that only one to two percent of the orders for\n\nblood tests included a request for a ferritin test.\n\n            Nothing in the medical literature at the time showed\n\nferritin was necessary for all persons receiving LabScans. Indeed,\n\nit was not.         A family practitioner testified that he needed\n\nferritin less than ten percent of the time it was included as part\n\nof the LabScan.      Similarly, an internist testified that he needed\n\nthe ferritin test for very few of his Medicare patients.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\f           The plan to add ferritin to the LabScan was discussed at\n\na general managers meeting in January 1988 and at a mid-year\n\nfinancial meeting for the western region in March 1988.                Thurston\n\nattended   both   meetings.        In    late   March,   Thurston   personally\n\napproved the addition of ferritin to the LabScans offered by the\n\nNewbury Park, San Francisco, and Phoenix labs.4           Thurston initially\n\nacquiesced when the Phoenix lab sought permission not to add\n\nferritin; in August 1988, however, after Thurston saw the financial\n\nresults from the addition of ferritin at his other labs, Thurston\n\nordered the Phoenix lab to add the test to the LabScan.\n\n           Thurston presented evidence that the decision to add\n\nferritin   was    made   at   a   lower    level   for   legitimate    reasons.\n\nThurston and Isola testified that at the general managers meeting\n\nin early 1988, management decided to allow individual laboratories\n\nto determine whether to add ferritin to the LabScan.                  There was\n\nalso testimony that Damon's sales force made requests to the sales\n\nmanagers and general managers of individual labs to add ferritin to\n\nthe LabScan, on the grounds that the new test would make the panel\n\nmore competitive.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n       There was abundant evidence that Thurston instructed his\nsubordinates to add ferritin. For example, the general manager of\nthe Chicago lab had contemporaneous notes of a conversation with\nThurston in 1988 indicating that Thurston told him to add ferritin\nto the LabScan.     The manager of the San Francisco lab also\ntestified that Thurston called him and told him to add the ferritin\ntest to the LabScan.\n\n                                        -10-\n\f            2.   Differential Charging for Ferritin Test\n\n                   (a)    Thurston's Knowledge of Price Differential\n\n            Medicare provided one reimbursement for the ferritin test\n\nand a separate reimbursement for the LabScan panel.      In 1988, for\n\nexample, Medicare paid $24.05 for a LabScan and $20.86 for a\n\nferritin test.\n\n            Thurston's labs submitted to him capital expenditure\n\nrequests (CERs) to help with the decision whether to bundle the\n\ntests.   CERs were financial projections comparing the additional\n\nrevenues (from Medicare reimbursements) and costs (partly from the\n\npurchase of new equipment) that would result from the addition of\n\nferritin to the LabScan.5       These CERs assumed there would be no\n\nincrease in the charge to doctors and patients for a LabScan with\n\nferritin.    Thurston discussed and then signed the CERs.        They\n\nprojected losses of revenue from doctors and patients (who would\n\nreceive free ferritin tests) and massive increases in revenue from\n\nMedicare reimbursements.      One lab, for example, projected that the\n\nnumber of ferritin tests performed for Medicare beneficiaries would\n\ngrow from 25 per month to 1,946 per month -- increasing revenues by\n\n$10,308 per month.       Overall, Thurston's labs projected that they\n\nwould increase their Medicare reimbursements by approximately $1.16\n\nmillion per year by adding ferritin to the LabScan; if multiplied\n\n\n     5\n       The defense argues that the CERs were prepared for the\nrelated purpose of justifying, to Damon executives, the purchase of\nequipment to carry out a higher volume of ferritin tests.\n\n                                  -11-\n\fby five years, this increase would be $5.8 million.               The capital\n\nexpenditure requests were best-case projections, assuming that\n\nevery doctor who would otherwise have ordered a LabScan without\n\nferritin would now order a LabScan with ferritin.\n\n            Damon    sought   reimbursement   (at   different     rates)   for\n\nferritin tests from Medicare, CHAMPUS,6 and other insurers, but\n\nprovided them for free to doctors and patients.            Thurston said he\n\nwas unaware doctors were not being charged.         But Thurston approved\n\nthe decision by a number of his labs to adopt this policy of\n\ndifferential pricing depending on the client, and the CERs assumed\n\nno price increase for doctors and patients.         Thurston instructed a\n\nsubordinate to add ferritin at no charge to doctors; Thurston was\n\npresent at a meeting in which another executive announced the no-\n\ncharge policy; and Thurston received a memo saying that there was\n\nno price increase for doctors at a lab he oversaw.                  Witnesses\n\ntestified that physicians are highly price-sensitive about charges\n\nfor lab work and might object to the automatic inclusion of\n\nferritin    unless   the   test   were   provided   for   free.     At   least\n\ninitially, many or all of Thurston's labs increased the charge to\n\nprivate insurance companies for a LabScan based on the addition of\n\nferritin.    However, any price increase for private insurers on the\n\n\n\n     6\n       CHAMPUS is the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the\nUniformed Services, a health benefit and insurance program for\ndependants of military personnel that is administered by the\nDepartment of Defense.\n\n                                    -12-\n\fexpanded LabScan     was    much       smaller   than    the   cost    increase   to\n\nMedicare.\n\n            Thurston presented evidence that two of his labs did\n\nincrease    the   price   for     physicians;     that    this    price   increase\n\nprovoked complaints by doctors; that he was informed of these\n\ncomplaints; and that he responded that doctors could not obtain a\n\nLabScan with ferritin unless they paid the higher price.                   He also\n\npresented evidence that the no-charge approach was a deviation from\n\ncorporate policy and was initiated by the heads of individual labs;\n\nthat he did not find out about any price differential until years\n\nafter it had been implemented; and that he sought to correct any\n\nprice differential as soon as he discovered it. Thurston testified\n\nthat he did not authorize, condone, or ratify a decision not to\n\nincrease    the   price   of     the   LabScan   based    on     the   addition   of\n\nferritin.\n\n                    (b)    Concealing Price Differential from Doctors\n\n            Thurston's labs took steps to conceal from doctors that,\n\nin addition to the LabScan charge, Medicare would pay an extra fee\n\nfor the ferritin tests.          No letters were sent to doctors advising\n\nthem that Medicare would be charged separately for the ferritin\n\ntest.   To the contrary, in April and May 1988, letters were sent to\n\nphysicians notifying them that the ferritin test was going to be\n\nautomatically added at \"no extra cost.\"            In Newbury Park, stickers\n\nwere    also   printed     and    added    to    physicians'       brochures      and\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\fdirectories saying, \"Ferritin Automatically Included at No Charge.\"\n\nOf course, as to Medicare patients, these statements were untrue.\n\n            Thurston    testified     that   he   did   not   pre-approve      the\n\nletters or stickers saying ferritin would be provided free to\n\ncustomers.       Thurston portrayed himself as a hands-off manager who\n\ntrusted subordinates to build in a charge to physicians and to\n\naccurately promote the expanded LabScan.\n\n            Several physicians testified they were initially unaware\n\nthat Damon charged Medicare for the ferritin component of the\n\nexpanded LabScan.      A number of Damon customers protested, and even\n\nswitched labs, when they belatedly discovered Damon was charging\n\nMedicare for ferritin tests conducted as part of the LabScan. When\n\ndoctors told Damon sales representatives that they did not need the\n\nadditional test, some were told that a LabScan without ferritin\n\nwould cost more than a LabScan with ferritin.                  A major client\n\nreferred Damon to a newspaper article criticizing the practice of\n\nbundling tests into panels and profiles, and warned Damon that its\n\nfailure     to    educate   doctors    about      the   composition     of     and\n\nalternatives to its panels would subject it to ongoing criticism.\n\nThurston was informed of these complaints, which were written up in\n\nmonthly management reports he received in 1989 and 1990.                Despite\n\nthese complaints, Thurston did not cause a letter to be sent to\n\ndoctors   informing     them   of   the   extra    charge     for   ferritin    to\n\nMedicare.\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\f          Damon    also   collaborated   with   HMOs    operating   on   a\n\ncapitation basis (i.e., paying a flat monthly fee for each HMO\n\nmember) to reduce utilization of bundled tests such as the LabScan.\n\nFor example, one of Thurston's labs added to its HMO requisition\n\nform a checkbox for a LabScan without ferritin.        Damon made no such\n\neffort to assist Medicare.\n\n          3.    Availability of LabScan Without Ferritin\n\n          Thurston instructed subordinates to take specific steps\n\nthat hid the fact that the LabScan could be ordered without\n\nferritin and made it difficult for doctors to order the LabScan\n\nseparately.    For example, Thurston told the general manager of the\n\nNewbury Park lab not to advertise or promote the fact that doctors\n\ncould still order a LabScan without ferritin.      Similarly, Thurston\n\nhelped make the decision to omit, from the Newbury Park letter\n\nannouncing to doctors the addition of ferritin to the LabScan, the\n\ntest code for ordering a LabScan without ferritin.          The standard\n\nrequisition forms used by Thurston's labs did not change following\n\nthe addition of ferritin to the LabScan; there was a checkbox for\n\nthe \"LabScan\" (which now included ferritin) but no box for the\n\n\"LabScan without ferritin\" or the \"LabScan with ferritin.\"\n\n          During the conspiracy period, there were at least two\n\nways for doctors to order the LabScan without ferritin. They could\n\nhandwrite such an order on a standard requisition form, or they\n\ncould request and obtain a customized requisition form with a\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fcheckbox for the LabScan without ferritin. A number of doctors and\n\ninstitutions took advantage of these options.\n\n           Thurston testified that he did not tell anyone to conceal\n\nor refrain from advertising that the LabScan could be ordered\n\nwithout ferritin. There was testimony that, after Thurston learned\n\nin 1991 that the front of a requisition form used by one of his\n\nlabs did not disclose the inclusion of ferritin in the LabScan, he\n\ninstructed a subordinate to list it on the front and the form was\n\nso amended.\n\n           4.   Apolipoprotein\n\n           Damon also added an apolipoprotein test to its coronary\n\nrisk panel in 1989.      Before apolipoprotein was added to the panel,\n\nclients ordered it very rarely.          The standard requisition forms\n\nDamon used after adding apolipoprotein to the panel also did not\n\noffer a checkbox for a coronary risk panel without apolipoprotein.\n\nFollowing the addition of apolipoprotein, the cost to doctors of\n\nthe coronary risk panel increased by five dollars.                Medicare\n\nreimbursed apolipoprotein separately at a rate well above five\n\ndollars.      Thurston    participated    in   the   decisions   about   the\n\naddition, the requisition forms for, and the extra charges for\n\napolipoprotein.\n\nD.   Thurston's \"Reasonable Interpretation\" as Evidence of Lack of\n     Criminal Intent\n\n           Thurston presented evidence that from 1988 to 1993 it was\n\nan industry-wide practice for labs to rely on the doctors who\n\n                                   -16-\n\fordered   tests   to   make     determinations   of   medical     necessity.\n\nBecause, prior to 1994, doctors did not normally share their\n\ndiagnoses with labs, labs did not have the information required to\n\ngauge medical necessity. Damon employees did not believe that they\n\ncertified tests as medically necessary when they submitted HCFA\n\n1500 forms with Medicare bills.       Instead, they believed it was the\n\ndoctors who ordered LabScans who made the certification.\n\n          Two expert witnesses testified that it was appropriate in\n\n1988 to include ferritin in a blood chemistry panel.            The bundling\n\nof   different    tests    into   panels   was   lawful   under     Medicare\n\nregulations. There was testimony that technological changes during\n\nthe 1980s made it possible to automate the ferritin test, which\n\npresumably made it much cheaper to conduct.           Witnesses for both\n\nsides testified that by 1988 some of Damon's competitors offered\n\nferritin as part of their blood chemistry panel and so Damon added\n\nthe test to stay competitive.\n\n                          II.   PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\nA.   Indictment and Trial\n\n           On January 22, 1998, a thirty-nine paragraph single-count\n\nindictment charged Thurston and three other former Damon executives\n\n-- Joseph Isola, Beno Kon, and Gerald Cullen -- with conspiring to\n\ndefraud HCFA in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 3717 by causing doctors to\n\n\n\n     7\n       Damon was separately indicted for conspiracy to defraud\nHCFA, on the basis of the same events.\n\n                                    -17-\n\forder unnecessary tests by adding a test for ferritin to a pre-\n\nexisting panel of diagnostic blood tests, and by adding a test for\n\napolipoproteins     to    a   profile     used   to   assess     coronary       artery\n\ndisease.    The conspiracy period was from July 1987 to August 1993.\n\n            Isola, President of Damon, pled no contest and, pursuant\n\nto his plea agreement, was sentenced to three years' probation and\n\na   one-hundred     dollar     special      assessment.          Kon,     Corporate\n\nController, died during the proceedings.                  Cullen, Senior Vice\n\nPresident for Operations, was tried before the district court in\n\nOctober 2001      and    acquitted   at    the   close    of    the    government's\n\nevidence.    In addition, Damon pled guilty on October 11, 1996 to\n\nconspiracy to defraud by bundling ferritin with the LabScan and\n\napolipoprotein with the cardiac risk panel.                     The company was\n\nsentenced to pay a $35,273,141 fine, and later entered into a civil\n\nsettlement under which it paid the United States and the state\n\nMedicaid programs an additional $83,756,904.\n\n            Thurston was tried before a jury in November and December\n\n2001.      The   trial   lasted   three     weeks.       At    the    close    of   the\n\ngovernment's evidence, the district court granted Thurston's motion\n\nfor judgment of acquittal as to the indictment's apolipoprotein\n\nallegations, ordered these allegations stricken, and explained to\n\nthe jury that only the ferritin allegations remained.                         The jury\n\nfound Thurston guilty.        Thurston's subsequent motions for judgment\n\n\n\n\n                                        -18-\n\fof acquittal and for a new trial were denied.                   The procedural\n\nrulings at trial that Thurston attacks are described below.\n\nB.   Sentencing\n\n           The district court sentenced Thurston to three months'\n\nimprisonment (with a judicial recommendation that the term be\n\nserved in a halfway house), followed by twenty-four months of\n\nsupervised release (of which the first three months were to be\n\nserved in home detention).      The court imposed a one-hundred dollar\n\nspecial assessment and no fine.        The Pre-Sentence Report (PSR) had\n\nrecommended a Total Offense Level of twenty-six and a Criminal\n\nHistory Category of one. The PSR identified the base offense level\n\nas six.   It recommended a fourteen-level upward enhancement for an\n\nintended loss     of   at   least   five    million   dollars;     a    two-level\n\nenhancement for more than minimal planning; and a four-level\n\nenhancement for a leadership role.             It also suggested that an\n\nenhancement for obstruction of justice was appropriate, on the\n\ngrounds that Thurston perjured himself at his trial.                     The PSR\n\nrecommended      the   statutory    maximum        term   of    sixty    months'\n\nimprisonment and noted that both the statute and the guideline\n\nallowed for a fine.     It calculated that Thurston had a net worth of\n\n$1,526,904.\n\n           The    defense     contested      the    PSR's      recommendations.\n\nThurston requested a three-level decrease because the substantive\n\noffense of defrauding the United States was incomplete; a four-\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\flevel decrease because Thurston was a minimal participant; and a\n\ntwo-level decrease for acceptance of responsibility.                     Thurston\n\nrequested a downward departure on the grounds that he had an\n\nextraordinary record of charitable work and community service; that\n\nthe offense constituted aberrant behavior; and that there was the\n\npotential for a large disparity with Isola's sentence.\n\n            The government argued that Thurston should receive a two-\n\nlevel upward enhancement for obstruction of justice. Otherwise, it\n\naccepted the recommendations of the PSR.            The parties agreed that\n\nany restitution had been made by Damon, the corporate defendant.\n\n            The district court sentenced Thurston at a hearing on\n\nJune 26, 2002 to three months' imprisonment, a period of supervised\n\nrelease, and no fine.       The district court granted a fourteen-level\n\nenhancement   for     the   size   of   the    intended   loss,   see U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2F1.1(b)(0) (1992 version),8 a four-level enhancement for an\n\naggravated role in the offense, see U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(a) (1992\n\nversion),   and   a   two-level     enhancement     for   more    than   minimal\n\nplanning, see U.S.S.G. § 2F1.1(b)(2) (1992 version). The court did\n\n\n     8\n       U.S.S.G. § 2F1.1 was deleted by consolidation with U.S.S.G.\n§ 2B1.1 effective November 1, 2001. See United States v. Gonzalez-\nAlvarez, 277 F.3d 73, 77 n.3 (1st Cir. 2002). Under the current\nguidelines, a loss exceeding $2.5 million warrants an eighteen-\nlevel upward enhancement.     U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(1).     When the\nguidelines in effect at the time of sentencing are more stringent\nthan those in effect at the time of the offense, the latter are\nnormally used, partly to avoid any hint of an ex post facto\nincrease in penalty. United States v. Maldonado, 242 F.3d 1, 5\n(1st Cir. 2001) (citing United States v. Harotunian, 920 F.2d 1040,\n1041-42 (1st Cir. 1990)).\n\n                                        -20-\n\fnot explicitly rule on the government's request for an obstruction\n\nof justice enhancement, see U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1 (1992 version), or\n\nThurston's request for a three-level decrease for failure to show\n\ncompletion of the substantive offense, see § 2X1.1 (1992 version).\n\nThurston's    adjusted      offense   level   of   twenty-six    and   criminal\n\nhistory category of one yielded a guidelines sentencing range of\n\nsixty-three to seventy-eight months' imprisonment; this range was\n\ntrumped by the statutory maximum of sixty months for a violation of\n\n18 U.S.C. § 371.\n\n             During   the    hearing,   the    government   confirmed      that\n\nThurston had been offered (and had rejected) a plea agreement\n\n\"along the lines\" of the one that Isola had accepted.                  Over the\n\ngovernment's objections and arguments, the district court then\n\ndeparted downward on the basis of Thurston's record of charitable\n\nwork and community service and the disparity between Thurston's and\n\nIsola's sentences.          The court then solicited the government's\n\nrecommendation about the extent of the departure.               The government\n\nresponded that, if the court chose to depart, then it should depart\n\nno further than the sentencing guidelines for a perjury conviction,\n\nwhich would be an offense level of twenty (six less than that of\n\nthe underlying offense), for a sentencing range of thirty-three to\n\nforty-one months' imprisonment.           The court then departed by at\n\nleast sixteen levels.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\f            The     government   appealed     the   sentence   and     Thurston\n\nappealed his conviction and sentence.\n\n             III.    THURSTON'S APPEAL FROM HIS CONVICTION\n\n            Thurston was convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 371, which\n\nprovides:\n\n            If two or more persons conspire either to commit any\n            offense against the United States, or to defraud the\n            United States, or any agency thereof in any manner or for\n            any purpose, and one or more of such persons do any act\n            to effect the object of the conspiracy, each shall be\n            fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five\n            years, or both.\n\nA.   Statute of Limitations\n\n            Thurston    argues   that   the    trial   court   erred    in   not\n\ngranting his post-verdict Rule 29 motion for acquittal, because the\n\ngovernment had not proved an overt act during the limitations\n\nperiod, and in not sua sponte instructing the jury on the statute\n\nof limitations.\n\n            The statute of limitations for 18 U.S.C. § 371 crimes is\n\nthe general five-year statute of limitations contained in 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3282.   Here, that five years ran back from January 22, 1998, the\n\ndate of the indictment, less the six weeks during which Thurston\n\nagreed to toll the limitations period.          The government, therefore,\n\nhad to prove an overt act was done on or after December 11, 1992.\n\nThe indictment properly alleged at least eight overt acts within\n\nthe limitations period.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -22-\n\f          Thurston     did   not   raise      the   defense    of   statute   of\n\nlimitations   either   before      or    at   trial,   did    not   request   an\n\ninstruction on the defense, and did not object when the judge\n\ninstructed without addressing the issue. Thurston first raised the\n\nissue by Rule 29 motion after the verdict.              The government says\n\nThurston raised the issue too late.                 There is a preliminary\n\nquestion of when such a motion should be raised, a question\n\naffecting our standard of review.\n\n          \"The statute of limitations is a defense and must be\n\nasserted on the trial by the defendant in criminal cases . . . .\"\n\nBiddinger v. Comm'r of Police, 245 U.S. 128, 135 (1917).              Here the\n\nindictment adequately pled facts to establish that the crime was\n\nwithin the limitations period.          Thurston was not required to raise\n\nthe defense before trial under Rule 12(b)(3), Fed. R. Crim P.                 Nor\n\nwould it have made sense for him to do so, since the defense\n\ndepended on what the government proved or failed to prove at trial.\n\nIn a criminal case a defendant need only plead as to the accusation\n\nof guilt in the indictment and need not raise the statute of\n\nlimitations as an affirmative defense before trial.9                  Thurston\n\nmistakes these truisms for an argument that he need not raise the\n\n\n\n\n     9\n       By contrast, in a civil case, a defense of statute of\nlimitations must be raised in an answer or it is lost. Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 8(c); In re Cumberland Farms, Inc., 284 F.3d 216, 225-27\n(1st Cir. 2002).\n\n                                    -23-\n\flimitations defense at all before the jury delivers a verdict of\n\nguilt.\n\n            The government says Thurston has waived10 the issue and\n\nmay not raise it at all.   Absent an explicit agreement to waive the\n\ndefense, we treat the issue as a forfeiture and not a waiver,\n\ncontrary to the government's argument. This was not an intentional\n\nrelinquishment or abandonment of a known right, the definition of\n\na waiver.   The issue of failure to assert the defense was viewed as\n\nforfeiture in United States v. O'Bryant, 998 F.2d 21, 23 n.1 (1st\n\nCir. 1993).    The rule we use -- that the defense of statute of\n\nlimitations must be raised at trial and, if not, is forfeited but\n\nnot waived -- is the rule in most circuits.    See United States v.\n\nRoss, 77 F.3d 1525, 1536 (7th Cir. 1996) (\"[I]t is widely accepted\n\nthat a statute of limitations defense is forfeited if not raised at\n\nthe trial itself.\") (citing cases).\n\n            Thurston has indeed forfeited11 the defense that the\n\ngovernment did not prove facts that an overt act occurred within\n\n\n     10\n       A defendant may waive the defense of statute of limitations\nby several means, including by entry of plea of guilty, see\nAcevedo-Ramos v. United States, 961 F.2d 305, 308 (1st Cir. 1992),\nor by a voluntary agreement, usually written, such as in a tolling\nagreement, see United States v. Spector, 55 F.3d 22, 24 (1st Cir.\n1995). None of those situations is present here.\n     11\n       Our reasoning that the argument has been forfeited would be\ndifferent if compliance with the limitations period were either\njurisdictional or an element of the offense that the government had\nthe burden of proving. Here, when the limitations defense is not\nan issue of law but is based on facts to be proven, the defense\nmust be raised at trial at the latest.\n\n                                -24-\n\fthe limitations period.                 The defense should have been raised at\n\ntrial.     Waiting until after the jury has rendered a verdict of\n\nguilt     to   raise    a   limitations          defense      for   the    first   time    is\n\ninconsistent        with     the        characterization        of       the    statute    of\n\nlimitations as an affirmative defense and would unfairly sandbag\n\nthe government.\n\n               Because this was a forfeiture and not a waiver, there is\n\nstill plain error review available under Fed. R. Crim. P. 52.                             See\n\nUnited     States      v.   Olano,       507    U.S.    725,    731-32     (1993).        Our\n\nconclusion       is      straightforward.              The     government's        evidence\n\nestablished overt acts by the conspirators within the limitations\n\nperiod, so       there      was    no    error    at    all    as   to    the   statute    of\n\nlimitations, much less plain error.\n\n               The government showed that labs overseen by Thurston (and\n\nhis co-conspirators) submitted tens of thousands of reimbursement\n\nclaims to Medicare after December 11, 1992 for ferritin tests\n\nconducted as part of LabScan orders. The government also presented\n\nample evidence that many of these tests were medically unnecessary\n\nand were submitted by doctors unaware that Medicare would be\n\ncharged separately for ferritin.12                     It was not credible that the\n\n\n     12\n       For example, government witness Dr. Johnson testified that\nhe ordered the LabScan regularly for Medicare patients; rarely\nneeded a ferritin test; and, when he discovered that Damon charged\nMedicare separately for ferritin, demanded that ferritin be removed\nfrom panels he ordered.     As demonstrated by a lab report the\ndefense introduced into evidence, Dr. Johnson continued ordering\nthe LabScan with ferritin for Medicare patients through mid-1993.\n\n                                               -25-\n\fferritin test, ordered less than two percent of the time, suddenly\n\nbecame medically necessary thirty to forty percent of the time\n\nwithin the life span of the conspiracy.\n\n           Thurston   also    argues   he    was   entitled     to   a   jury\n\ninstruction on the limitations point. By failing to request a jury\n\ninstruction and failing to object to the lack of an instruction, he\n\nhas forfeited the argument.    Fed. R. Crim. P. 30; see United States\n\nv. Gallant, 306 F.3d 1181, 1187 (1st Cir. 2002) (\"[A] party unhappy\n\nwith a trial court's jury instruction [must] promptly state the\n\nprecise objection after the instruction has been given.\").                As\n\nthere was no error, the plain error standard was not met.            See Fed.\n\nR. Crim. P. 30, 52(b).\n\nB.   Purported Lack of Criminal Intent and the Requested Reasonable\n     Interpretation Instruction\n\n           Procedurally, the issue of reasonable interpretation\n\ncomes up in two ways: denial of Thurston's Rule 29 motions and\n\ndenial of his request for a jury instruction.             Thurston's three\n\nRule 29 motions -- at the end of the government's case, at the end\n\nof the defense case, and after the verdict -- all argued that he\n\nlacked the needed criminal intent.          Our review is of whether a\n\nrational fact finder could conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt,\n\nthat the government proved the elements of the crime, including\n\nintent. United States v. Moran, 312 F.3d 480, 487 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\nThurston   also   requested    a   jury     instruction    on    reasonable\n\n\n\n                                   -26-\n\finterpretation of the law13 and preserved his objection to the\n\ncourt's rejection of the instruction.\n\n             Thurston argued he reasonably interpreted the law as\n\nrequiring that the treating physician, not the test lab, certify to\n\nthe   HCFA    that   the   test   ordered   was   medically   necessary   and\n\nreasonable, and that he and the company were entitled to rely on\n\nthat physician certification.          Specifically, Thurston contended\n\nthat in the relevant time period an independent clinical lab did\n\nnot violate any aspect of Medicare law by: (1) providing physicians\n\nwith a panel containing a ferritin test, so long as the physician\n\nwas given reliable and accurate information about the test and\n\n\n      13\n           The instruction he requested stated in part:\n\n           Mr. Thurston contends that an independent clinical\n      laboratory does not violate any aspect of Medicare law in\n      providing physicians with a profile or panel that contains a\n      serum ferritin test, so long as the physician is given\n      reliable and accurate information about the test and the\n      choice to select the profile or panel with or without the\n      added test.\n\n           Mr. Thurston also contends that an independent clinical\n      laboratory does not violate any aspect of Medicare law in\n      submitting a claim for reimbursement, using a HCFA form or\n      otherwise, so long as the blood tests performed were ordered\n      by a physician.\n\n           I instruct you as a matter of              law that    these are\n      reasonable   interpretations of the              Medicare    statutes,\n      regulations and rules.\n\n           In order for you to find Mr. Thurston guilty on the basis\n      that he caused physicians to order medically unnecessary tests\n      for their patients, the government must prove beyond a\n      reasonable doubt that these were not Mr. Thurston's\n      interpretations of the pertinent Medicare laws.\n\n                                     -27-\n\fcould select the panel without the test; or (2) submitting a\n\nreimbursement claim, using a HCFA form or otherwise, so long as a\n\nphysician ordered the test performed.          This is one of his primary\n\narguments on appeal.\n\n          Whether a particular defense doctrine is germane depends\n\non the crime charged and the facts of the case.            This is where\n\nThurston's argument falters.       He argues that he could not have had\n\nthe needed intent because employees of clinical labs, including\n\nThurston, \"were unaware that they were actually certifying the\n\nmedical necessity of each test performed for every patient\" and\n\nthey could reasonably interpret the law to mean that the treating\n\nphysician,   not   the    laboratory,   made   the   certification.   The\n\nargument is beside the point.14\n\n          Thurston was not charged with making a false statement to\n\nthe United States, the falsity of which turned on an ambiguity in\n\nwhat the law required.       Nor was he charged with failing to make a\n\nstatement required by law in a situation of parallel ambiguity. He\n\nwas not charged with falsely certifying the medical necessity of\n\nthe tests ordered.       He was charged with the crime of conspiracy to\n\ndefraud the United States by inducing physicians through deceit and\n\ntrickery into certifying tests as medically necessary when the\n\n\n\n     14\n        Thurston argues it would be nonsensical to ask clinical\ntesting laboratories to guarantee that a test ordered by a doctor\nwas in fact medically necessary.    That question simply is not\nraised here.\n\n                                   -28-\n\fferritin tests were not necessary, thus leading Medicare to pay for\n\nunnecessary services.\n\n            Thurston's knowledge of the Medicare regulations and of\n\nthe fact that the ordering physicians would certify the medical\n\nnecessity of the tests was, ironically, part of the proof of the\n\ncrime, not a defense.          Thurston cannot, under 18 U.S.C. § 371,\n\nknowingly     conspire    to    mislead     and   manipulate       doctors   into\n\ncertifying    medically    unnecessary      tests    which   led    to   improper\n\npayment of Medicare funds and then defend on the basis that he\n\ncommitted no fraud because the doctors, not he, were the ones who\n\ncertified the tests as necessary.\n\n             Thurston's reliance on United States v. Prigmore, 243\n\nF.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2001), is misplaced.             Prigmore is part of a line\n\nof cases charging false statements or failure to make required\n\nstatements, holding that intent should be measured against an\n\nobjectively reasonable understanding of the legal requirements to\n\nbe met, and that a statement is not in fact false or fraudulent if\n\nit is based on an objectively reasonable interpretation of that\n\nlegal requirement.       See id. at 17-18.          This court first applied\n\nthis principle in United States v. Rowe, 144 F.3d 15, 21-23 (1st\n\nCir. 1998), to a statement that was not in fact false under an\n\nobjectively reasonable interpretation of a disclosure requirement.\n\nIn Prigmore, the conspiracy charged was to defraud and impair the\n\nfunctioning of the Food and Drug Administration, in connection with\n\n\n                                     -29-\n\fits oversight and regulation of medical devices, through failure to\n\nfile reports which were required under certain conditions.            The\n\nfraud alleged was the failure to submit a pre-market approval\n\ninformation supplement to the FDA, but whether such a supplement\n\nwas required depended on the interpretation of certain regulations.\n\nThe same conditional requirement was true of certain testing\n\nreports. The question was whether defendants could objectively and\n\nreasonably understand one regulatory phrase, \"affecting the safety\n\nor effectiveness of the device,\" as being circumscribed by another\n\nregulatory phrase, \"intended . . . conditions of use.\"            See 243\n\nF.3d at 15.\n\n            No similar question was presented here.             Here, the\n\nunderlying crime was one of manipulating doctors into making false\n\ncertifications    so   Damon   could    receive   unwarranted    Medicare\n\npayments.     There is no material question about ambiguity in the\n\nunderlying legal requirements and no germane question about the\n\nmeaning of the law.    There was also no issue of lack of fair notice\n\nof what the law requires, a concern underlying the Prigmore/Rowe\n\nline of cases.     A reasonable person knows it is wrong to trick\n\nothers into doing something wrong that one does not do directly\n\noneself, especially in order to obtain personal gain. The Prigmore\n\ndoctrine has no application given the crimes charged and the facts\n\ninvolved.     Because the nature of the crime charged made the\n\n\n\n\n                                 -30-\n\freasonable interpretation doctrine irrelevant, the jury instruction\n\nissue disappears.\n\nC.   Failure of District Court to Respond To Requested Instructions\n\n           Thurston argues that the district court violated Rule 30,\n\nFed. R. Crim. P., which provides:\n\n           (a)      In General.   Any party may request in writing\n                    that the court instruct the jury on the law as\n                    specified in the request.   The request must be\n                    made at the close of the evidence or at any\n                    earlier time that the court reasonably sets.\n                    When the request is made, the requesting party\n                    must furnish a copy to every other party.\n\n           (b)      Ruling on a Request. The court must inform the\n                    parties before closing arguments how it intends\n                    to rule on the requested instructions.\n\nThurston is correct: the district court failed to inform the\n\nparties of how it intended to rule on each of the requested\n\ninstructions before closing arguments, as required by the rule.\n\n           A description of the interactions of court and counsel\n\nsets the   stage.     Each   side   submitted   extensive   requests   for\n\ninstructions, and there were disagreements.15 The court did resolve\n\n\n\n      15\n       As examples of disagreements, Thurston gives the following.\nThe   government   filed   objections   to   Thurston's   requested\ninstructions concerning character evidence and reputation (No. 7);\nThurston's status as vice-president (No. 10); the definition of\n\"knowingly\" (No. 16); the definition of \"willfully\" (No. 17); proof\nof specific intent to participate (No. 18); the definition of\n\"overt act\" (No. 21); the good-faith defense (No. 22); and\nThurston's reasonable interpretation of Medicare laws (No. 23).\nCounsel for Thurston objected to three of the government's\nrequested instructions, each of which concerned an element of the\noffense: conspiracy (No. 18); unlawful objectives (No. 19); and\novert acts (No. 22).\n\n                                    -31-\n\fthe most serious disputes over some of the instructions (for\n\ninstance, on the reasonable interpretation/Prigmore question) and\n\ntold counsel these rulings before closing argument.                 The court did\n\nnot, though, review all of the requests.            Thurston's counsel did\n\nnot object to this silence before giving his closing.\n\n             Defense counsel did raise an issue after closing, and\n\nbefore the jury was instructed, that he wanted to put on record his\n\nspecific objections to the government's requests.               He did not say\n\nhe had been prejudiced in any way by the court's failure to rule on\n\nthe requested instructions before he gave his closing.                  The court\n\nreplied that it would neither rule on nor hear argument on the\n\nproposed instructions.     Rather, the court stated its understanding\n\nthat   the   appropriate   time   to   object     was   at    the    end   of   the\n\ninstructions.       Nonetheless,       it   did   hear       argument      on   the\n\ngovernment's Request No. 8 (the compelled witness rule), and\n\ndeclined to give the instruction.           It also heard argument on the\n\ngovernment's proposed instructions No. 18 (conspiracy); No. 19\n\n(unlawful objectives); and No. 22 (overt act).               The only proposed\n\ndefense instruction called to the court's attention was No. 24, on\n\nmissing witnesses.\n\n             The district court did not, as Rule 30 requires, tell\n\ncounsel before closing argument its disposition of all of the\n\nrequested instructions. But counsel for Thurston had an obligation\n\n\n\n\n                                   -32-\n\fto bring this to the court's attention before the closing and did\n\nnot do so.\n\n              Without addressing the issue of whether Thurston has thus\n\nforfeited the Rule 30 argument, we choose to simply evaluate\n\nwhether defense counsel's closing argument was adversely affected.\n\nSee United States v. Owens, 167 F.3d 739, 753 (1st Cir. 1999).                 It\n\nwas not.      One telling indicium that there was no prejudice is that\n\ntrial counsel did not ever say to the court he would be prejudiced\n\nif he had to proceed with his closing without knowing the court's\n\ndisposition of the remaining requested instructions.\n\n              An even more telling indicium of lack of prejudice is\n\nthat Thurston's appellate counsel has been unable to identify any\n\nspecific areas of prejudice occasioned by the trial court's lapse.\n\nWhile in theory such a lapse could cause prejudice, the most that\n\nis   argued    here   is    that   there   was   \"no    detailed   reference   to\n\nimportant legal concepts regarding criminal conspiracy and the\n\nstate of mind by which Thurston would be judged.\"                        Appellate\n\ncounsel does not identify those \"important legal concepts,\" and we\n\nsee none.       As to Thurston's state of mind, the trial judge did\n\ninstruct on the government's burden to show Thurston had a specific\n\nintent to participate in the conspiracy and to defraud the United\n\nStates.       The   court   instructed     the   jury    to   consider    Thurston\n\nindividually to determine if he willfully joined the conspiracy.\n\nThe court, in turn, defined \"willfully.\" The court also explicitly\n\n\n                                      -33-\n\frejected Thurston's reasonable interpretation instruction, and it\n\ninstructed on good faith.       These circumstances belie any claim of\n\nprejudice and Thurston's claim fails.\n\nD.   Motion for New Trial Based on Dismissal of Apolipoprotein\n     Charge\n\n           Thurston and his co-defendants were originally charged\n\nwith conspiracy to commit fraud as to both the ferritin and the\n\napolipoprotein tests.        At the close of the government's case the\n\ncourt granted Thurston's motion for judgment of acquittal on the\n\napolipoprotein test, struck those references from the indictment,\n\nand instructed the jury that this issue was no longer before it.\n\nThe government did not thereafter refer to this issue.\n\n           Thurston now argues that the court should have granted\n\nThurston   a   new   trial    after    the   jury   returned   because   the\n\napolipoprotein evidence irretrievably tainted the trial.                 The\n\ngovernment rejoins that counsel should have raised the issue\n\nsooner.\n\n           Again, we bypass the issue of forfeiture and reject the\n\nargument that dismissal of the apolipoprotein charges tainted the\n\nproceedings.   Thurston's argument that none of this evidence would\n\nhave been admitted if the ferritin charges were tried alone is\n\nbased on an unlikely premise.         Where the evidence admitted as to a\n\ndismissed count would have been admissible as to a remaining count,\n\nthe defendant has not suffered prejudice. United States v. Rooney,\n\n37 F.3d 847, 855-56 (2d Cir. 1994) (collecting cases); see United\n\n                                      -34-\n\fStates v. Weiner, 3 F.3d 17, 22 (1st Cir. 1993) (jury properly\n\nconsidered evidence relating to counts dismissed prior to verdict,\n\nsince evidence was relevant to remaining counts).\n\n            The government would have introduced such evidence in any\n\nevent as relevant to rebut central defense themes that, because\n\nDamon had such a decentralized decision-making structure, Thurston\n\nwas not involved in key decisions.            The apolipoprotein evidence\n\ncontradicted Thurston's claims about the extent and consequences of\n\nDamon's    decentralized     approach   to    the   make-up,   pricing,    and\n\nmarketing of its panels.\n\n            There was little risk of prejudice for other reasons.\n\nThe government did not mention the apolipoprotein evidence in its\n\nclosing,    and   exhibits   pertaining      only   to   apolipoprotein   were\n\nremoved before the documents were submitted to the jury.            Further,\n\nmost of the testimony and documentary evidence in the first half of\n\nthe case, before the court ruled on the Rule 29 motion, dealt with\n\nferritin.    These factors further minimized the likelihood of any\n\ntaint.\n\n            Thurston's conviction is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -35-\n\f          United States Court of Appeals\n                        For the First Circuit\n\n                                                  Volume II of II\n\nNos. 02-1966, 02-1967\n\n                    UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\n\n                   Appellant / Cross-Appellee,\n\n                                 v.\n\n                          WILLIAM THURSTON,\n\n             Defendant, Appellee / Cross-Appellant.\n\n\n          APPEALS FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n     [Hon.

Russoniello and\nCooley Godward LLP were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n                          February 4, 2004\n\f                           IV.    SENTENCING APPEALS\n\nA.   Thurston's Appeal:          Loss Calculation\n\n               Much of Thurston's guidelines sentence range (sixty-three\n\nto seventy-eight months) was driven by the loss calculation.                Both\n\nthe PSR and the government recommended an intended loss figure of\n\nmore than five million dollars but less than ten million dollars.\n\nThis resulted in a fourteen-level increase in the base offense\n\nlevel.\n\n               Thurston,    not      surprisingly,      targets      this   loss\n\ncalculation.        He makes two arguments.            The first is that the\n\ngovernment was precluded by a comment to U.S.S.G. § 2F1.1 from ever\n\nrelying on intended loss unless the government first established\n\nwhat the actual loss was and then established that the intended\n\nloss     was    greater.     This      is   a   pure    issue   of    guidelines\n\ninterpretation, which we review de novo.                See United States v.\n\nGonzalez-Alvarez, 277 F.3d 73, 77 (1st Cir. 2002).                   The second\n\nargument is that the court's conclusion had insufficient factual\n\nsupport for a number of reasons, a contention reviewed for clear\n\nerror.\n\n               The guidelines interpretation argument turns on a comment\n\nthat provides:\n\n               Consistent with the provisions of § 2X1.1 (Attempt,\n               Solicitation or Conspiracy), if an intended loss that the\n               defendant was attempting to inflict can be determined,\n               this figure will be used if it is greater than the actual\n               loss.\n\n\n                                       -36-\n\fU.S.S.G. § 2F1.1, cmt. n.7 (Fraud and Deceit) (1992 version).\n\n          Thurston argues that because the government did not show\n\nactual loss, it cannot turn to intended loss.      The argument is\n\nsimply wrong as a matter of the wording of the comment.         The\n\ncomment directs the use of an intended loss figure when it is\n\ngreater than the actual loss figure; the comment does not restrict\n\nthe sentencing court's ability to rely on intended loss when there\n\nis no actual loss calculation available.   Defendant's reading also\n\nmakes little sense: it may be easier as a matter of proof to show\n\nintended loss than actual loss.   Conspirators are held accountable\n\nfor the loss they intend to commit.     Finally, it is obvious on\n\nthese facts that the intended loss was greater than the actual loss\n\n-- some doctors quit using Damon when, to their disgust, they\n\nrealized what the scheme was.\n\n          Thurston next mounts a series of fact-based attacks on\n\nthe intended loss figure of more than five million dollars.     That\n\nfigure is supported by the capital expenditure requests each of the\n\nlabs prepared to obtain funding to buy the equipment needed to\n\nperform the increased ferritin testing the labs anticipated.    Each\n\nCER included a financial analysis, one component of which was the\n\nestimated new revenue from bundling the tests.   Thus, the intended\n\nloss calculation was based on the conspirators' own financial\n\ncalculations.\n\n\n\n\n                                -37-\n\f           Thurston    argues     the   CERs,    being       mere    financial\n\nprojections, are not an adequate basis for an intended loss figure;\n\nthat the CERs were based on an assumed best-case scenario in which\n\nno physician who ordered Labscans would decline to get ferritin\n\ntests; that, in any event, not all physicians who ordered the\n\nbundled test were tricked into doing so; that the conspiracy was\n\nnot proven to last five years; that the conspiracy ended before\n\nfive years had elapsed for several labs, given the different dates\n\non which the labs bundled the tests; and that later, only one lab\n\nreported to Thurston.\n\n           A number of these are quickly dispatched.                 The jury\n\nverdict of guilt disposes of the question of the length of the\n\nconspiracy. Thurston's promotion out of management of three of the\n\nlabs is irrelevant since he earlier conspired to produce losses\n\nintended to go on for years.\n\n           Thurston also argues that the intended loss had to be\n\nreduced under U.S.S.G. § 2X1.1(b)(2) because the government's proof\n\ndid not establish that the conspirators had \"completed all the acts\n\nthe   conspirators    believed    necessary     on   their    part    for   the\n\nsuccessful completion of the substantive offense.\"             Id.    There is\n\nno merit to the argument.       There was successful completion of the\n\noffense:   the tests were bundled and doctors were misled into\n\nordering unnecessary ferritin tests. The complaints from customers\n\nabout Damon's practices were confirmation the scheme had worked.\n\n\n                                   -38-\n\f            The closer question is the degree of precision the\n\ngovernment must reach in showing intended loss.       It is true that\n\nthe CERs set forth best-case scenarios which assumed all doctors\n\nwould order the bundled test without culling out the ferritin test.\n\nIf the CERs stood alone, defendant would have a better argument.\n\nBut they are supplemented by the fact that Damon made it extremely\n\ndifficult for doctors to cull out the ferritin and order the\n\nLabscan without a ferritin test.\n\n            Further, the conspirators tried to hide from doctors the\n\nfact that there was a significant cost to Medicare associated with\n\nthe bundling.    The conspirators were maximizing the probability\n\nthat all doctors would accept the bundling, without culling and\n\nwithout protest.   The fact that the conspirators were not entirely\n\nsuccessful in fooling all doctors does not lessen their intent.\n\n            We have noted before that intended loss does not have to\n\nbe determined with precision; the court needs only to make a\n\nreasonable estimate in light of the available information.     United\n\nStates v. Blastos, 258 F.3d 25, 30 (1st Cir. 2001).    There was good\n\nevidence of intent and some \"prospect of success\" for the fraud to\n\nreap over five million dollars, and that is all that the case law\n\nrequires.   United States v. Orlando-Figueroa, 229 F.3d 33, 48 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).    The best-case CER projection was a loss to Medicare\n\nover the charged five-year life of the conspiracy of $5,800,230.\n\nIt was reasonable for the district court to estimate that the\n\n\n                                -39-\n\fintended loss exceeded five million dollars, even allowing for the\n\none to two percent normal order rate for ferritin tests.                  The\n\ngovernment met its burden and Thurston offered little in rebuttal\n\nexcept his protestations of innocence.              There was no clear error.\n\nB.   Government's Appeal\n\n             Given    an   intended   loss     of    five   million   dollars,\n\nThurston's crime led to the statutory maximum sentence of five\n\nyears.   The district court departed downward from the Guidelines\n\nrange by sixteen levels, however, sentencing Thurston to three\n\nmonths' imprisonment to be followed by twenty-four months of\n\nsupervised release. The court imposed no fine and recommended that\n\nthe term of imprisonment be served in a halfway house.\n\n             1.   Standard of Review:        The PROTECT Act\n\n            On April 30, 2003, section 401 of the PROTECT Act became\n\neffective.    That section changes the applicable standard of review\n\nfor certain issues in appeals from departures from the sentencing\n\nguidelines.       Section 401 amends 18 U.S.C. § 3742(e), which now\n\nprovides:\n\n            (e) Consideration. -- Upon review of the record, the\n            court of appeals shall determine whether the sentence --\n\n            . . . .\n\n                      (3) is outside the applicable guideline range, and\n\n                           (A) the district court failed to provide the\n                           written statement of reasons required by\n                           section 3553(c);\n\n\n\n                                      -40-\n\f                       (B) the sentence departs from the applicable\n                       guideline range based on a factor that --\n\n                            (i) does not advance the objectives set\n                            forth in section 3553(a)(2); or\n\n                            (ii) is not authorized under section\n                            3553(b); or\n\n                            (iii) is not justified by the facts of\n                            the case; or\n\n                       (C) the sentence departs to an unreasonable\n                       degree from the applicable guidelines range,\n                       having regard for the factors to be\n                       considered in imposing a sentence, as set\n                       forth in section 3553(a) of this title and\n                       the reasons for the imposition of the\n                       particular sentence, as stated by the\n                       district court pursuant to the provisions of\n                       section 3553(c); . . . .\n\n           . . . .\n\n           The court of appeals shall give due regard to the\n           opportunity of the district court to judge the\n           credibility of the witnesses, and shall accept the\n           findings of fact of the district court unless they are\n           clearly   erroneous   and,   except   with   respect   to\n           determinations under subsection (3)(A) or (3)(B), shall\n           give due deference to the district court's application of\n           the guidelines to the facts.           With respect to\n           determinations under subsection (3)(A) or (3)(B), the\n           court of appeals shall review de novo the district\n           court's application of the guidelines to the facts.\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n           This changed the law.   Under Koon v. United States, 518\n\nU.S. 81 (1996), the courts of appeals were not to review a\n\ndeparture decision de novo, but were to ask whether the sentencing\n\ncourt abused its discretion in granting the departure.   Id. at 91,\n\n96-100.   In appeals from sentencing departures, we had, before the\n\n\n                                -41-\n\fPROTECT Act, engaged in a three-part review: \"(1) we determine[d]\n\nwhether       the    stated    ground   for   departure     [was]    theoretically\n\npermissible under the guidelines; (2) if so, we examine[d] the\n\nrecord to assess whether there [was] adequate factual support; and\n\n(3)     we    determine[d]      the     appropriateness      of   the   degree     of\n\ndeparture.\"          United States v. Bogdan, 302 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).       Whether the stated ground for departure was theoretically\n\npermissible -- the first part -- was a question of law reviewed de\n\nnovo.        United States v. Bradstreet, 207 F.3d 76, 81 (1st Cir.\n\n2000); see also United States v. Diaz, 285 F.3d 92, 97-98 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).       Under Koon, our review under the remaining two parts was\n\nfor abuse of discretion only.             See Koon, 518 U.S. 96-100; United\n\nStates v. Lujan, 324 F.3d 27, 31 n.5 (1st Cir. 2003); United States\n\nv. Martin, 221 F.3d 52, 55 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n               After the PROTECT Act, the statute requires de novo\n\nreview not merely of the ultimate decision to depart, but also of\n\n\"the district court's application of the guidelines to the facts.\"\n\n§ 3742(e).          If this court agrees that the decision to depart was\n\njustified       under    the    guidelines,     however,    the     extent   of   the\n\ndeparture granted by the district court is reviewed deferentially,\n\njust as it was prior to the PROTECT Act.                   Id.; United States v.\n\nFrazier, 340 F.3d 5, 14 n.4 (1st Cir. 2003); see also United States\n\nv. Mallon, 345 F.3d 943, 946 (7th Cir. 2003); United States v.\n\nJones, 332 F.3d 1294, 1300(10th Cir. 2003).\n\n\n                                         -42-\n\f                   (a)    Retroactivity\n\n            Thurston argues that the PROTECT Act should not be\n\ninterpreted to apply to this case and that, if it does apply, it is\n\nretroactive and invalid.       He makes two statutory intent arguments:\n\n(1) that the internal structure of the statute means it should not\n\nbe applied to cases already pending on appeal; and (2) that the\n\npresumption against retroactivity should apply.\n\n            First, Thurston argues that Congress meant application of\n\nthe de novo review provisions in the PROTECT Act to be deferred\n\nuntil appeals arise from sentences entered after the Act became\n\neffective.    This is evident, Thurston says, since the Act imposed\n\na   new   requirement    for   the   district   judge   to   give   a   written\n\nstatement of reasons.      From this, Thurston argues, all provisions\n\nof the Act were meant to apply only to post-Act sentencing.                The\n\nargument is plausible, but we are unpersuaded.               Even before the\n\nPROTECT Act, a trial court was required to give some reasons,\n\nthough not necessarily in writing, for a downward departure.               See\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(c)(pre-PROTECT Act version); United States v.\n\nSclamo, 997 F.2d 970, 973 (1st Cir. 1993) (discussing discouraged\n\nground for departure); United States v. DeMasi, 40 F.3d 1306, 1324\n\n(1st Cir. 1994) (same).          A requirement that this statement of\n\nreasons be written, rather than oral, has no particular connection\n\nto the appellate standard of review.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -43-\n\f           Although the Act does not expressly say that its de novo\n\nreview provision applies to pending appeals, it does give an\n\neffective date of April 30, 2003.   The effective date of a statute\n\ndoes not by itself establish that it has any application to conduct\n\nthat occurred at an earlier date.      See INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S.\n\n289, 317 (2001) (quoting Landgraf v. USI Film Prods., 511 U.S. 244,\n\n257 (1994)).   Still, we agree with the Eighth Circuit that the new\n\nstatute applies to appeals pending as of the effective date of the\n\nstatute.   See United States v. Aguilar-Lopez, 329 F.3d 960, 962-63\n\n(8th Cir. 2003).   Subject to constitutionally based retroactivity\n\nconcerns, it is certainly within Congress's power to change a\n\nstandard of review.   See, e.g., Hines v. Sec'y of Dep't of Health\n\n& Human Servs., 940 F.2d 1518, 1523 (Fed. Cir. 1991); Consumers\n\nUnion of U.S. v. FTC, 801 F.2d 417 (D.C. Cir. 1986); cf. Bierce v.\n\nWaterhouse, 219 U.S. 320, 336-37 (1911).       Much of the conduct\n\nregulated by this part of the PROTECT Act is that of the courts of\n\nappeals (and indirectly, the district courts now under closer\n\nscrutiny), and that involves conduct dating from April 30, 2003\n\nforward.\n\n           Thurston's fall-back argument is that applying a changed\n\nstandard of review to a case already on appeal would have an\n\nimpermissible effect on him under the Supreme Court's retroactivity\n\njurisprudence.   See Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 264.   Not so.   The change\n\nof a standard of appellate review is one in procedure for the\n\n\n                                -44-\n\fcourts; procedural changes that do not affect substantial rights\n\nare   not   usually    considered   impermissibly   retroactive.    This\n\nlegislation is little different than the Supreme Court's changing\n\nthe standard of review by directing the courts of appeals to decide\n\nultimate Fourth Amendment questions de novo. Cf. Ornelas v. United\n\nStates, 517 U.S. 690, 697 (1996).       The PROTECT Act's alteration of\n\nthe appellate standard of review upsets no legitimate reliance\n\ninterest by a defendant; it could not have induced alteration of\n\nthe behavior that led to the crime.16         We see no unfairness to\n\ndefendants in Congress's requiring a closer look by appellate\n\ncourts at whether a district court committed an error in deciding\n\nthat the guidelines permitted a departure.         It is the substance of\n\nthe sentencing rules, both in the Guidelines and in the underlying\n\nstatutes, that affects defendants.17\n\n                      (b)   Separation of Powers\n\n\n      16\n       In Thurston's case, there could be no reliance interest in\nany event, since this court used a de novo standard of review at\nthe time he committed the crime. Before Koon was decided in 1996,\nthe rule in this circuit was that we would review de novo whether\n\"taking the reasons for departure stated by the district court at\nface value, those reasons will as a matter of law justify\nabandonment of the guidelines.\" United States v. Wogan, 938 F.2d\n1446, 1447 (1st Cir. 1991).\n      17\n       Since the original panel opinion issued in this case, every\nother circuit to address the question has similarly held that the\nPROTECT Act does not have an impermissibly retroactive effect when\napplied to cases pending as of the Act's effective date.        See\nUnited States v. Stockton, 349 F.3d 755, 764 n.4 (4th Cir. 2003);\nUnited States v. Bell, 351 F.3d 672, 674-75 (5th Cir. 2003); United\nStates v. Mallon, 345 F.3d 943, 946-47 (7th Cir. 2003); United\nStates v. Willey, 350 F.3d 736, 738-39 (8th Cir. 2003).\n\n                                    -45-\n\f            Thurston makes a cursory argument that the PROTECT Act\n\npresents serious constitutional separation-of-powers questions. At\n\nthe request of the Senate, the Chief Justice, expressing the views\n\nof the U.S. Judicial Conference, did advise the Senate of the\n\nConference's       opposition         to    portions   of    the   bill,   including\n\nalteration of the standard of review.                       See Letter from Chief\n\nJustice William H. Rehnquist to Senator Patrick Leahy (undated),\n\navailable          at        http://www.nacdl.org/public.nsf/2cdd02b415ea\n\n3a64852566d6000daa79/departures/$FILE/Rehnquist_letter.pdf.                      The\n\nU.S. Sentencing Commission requested that Congress not act until\n\nthe Commission had the opportunity to analyze data and study the\n\nmatter.     See Letter from Judge Diana Murphy, Chair of the U.S.\n\nSentencing Commission, et al., to Senators Orrin Hatch and Patrick\n\nLeahy     (April        2,   2003),        available   at    http://www.nacdl.org/\n\npublic.nsf/2cdd02b415ea3a64852566d6000daa79/departures/$FILE/stcg\n\n_comm_current.pdf.             But judicial opposition to legislation on\n\npolicy grounds is one thing; unconstitutionality is quite another.\n\nNo real theory of unconstitutionality has been presented by this\n\nappeal, and so the issue is waived.                 See United States v. Zannino,\n\n895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                         (c)   Scope of De Novo Review\n\n            A different argument was advanced in the petition for\n\nrehearing concerning the scope of de novo review under the PROTECT\n\n\n\n\n                                             -46-\n\fAct.18        The final sentence of § 3742(e) requires the court of\n\nappeals to review de novo all determinations by the district court\n\n\"under subsection (3)(A) or (3)(B),\" the texts of which are set\n\nforth above.              In    his    petition       for   rehearing,    Thurston,          ably\n\nassisted       by    amicus,        argues     that     subparagraphs      (3)(B)(i)         and\n\n(3)(B)(ii) apply only in cases involving \"unmentioned\" departures,\n\ni.e.,     departures           on   grounds     not    expressly    considered          by   the\n\nSentencing       Commission.             On    this     theory,    because       good    works\n\ndepartures are specifically authorized (albeit discouraged) by the\n\nguidelines,         this       court   is     not   authorized     to    ask   whether,       in\n\nThurston's case, such a departure\n\n        (i)  does not advance the objectives set forth                              in\n             section 3553(a)(2); or\n        (ii) is not authorized under section 3553(b)[.]\n\n§ 3742(e)(3)(B).           Instead, the argument goes, this court is bound\n\nto accept the judgment of the Sentencing Commission that good works\n\ndepartures          are    consistent         with     §    3553(a)(2)     and    (b),       and\n\naccordingly must limit its review to whether a good works departure\n\n\"is not justified by the facts of the case\" under subparagraph\n\n(iii).\n\n\n\n     18\n       Ordinarily, this court does not consider arguments raised\nfor the first time in a petition for rehearing. United States v.\nBongiorno, 110 F.3d 132, 133 (1st Cir. 1997); Am. Policyholders\nIns. Co. v. Nyacol Prods., Inc., 989 F.2d 1256, 1264 (1st Cir.\n1993); Kale v. Combined Ins. Co., 924 F.2d 1161, 1169 (1st Cir.\n1991).   Because of the importance of this issue of statutory\nconstruction, however, we bypass Thurston's failure to raise the\npoint earlier and consider the argument on its merits.\n\n                                               -47-\n\f               The government's response to this argument is less than\n\nclear.       The United States contends that \"[n]othing in [the PROTECT\n\nAct] limits consideration of the factors in § 3553(a)(2) or the\n\nCommission's        intentions       as   set      out    [in]     §    3553(b)(1)[]         to\n\nunmentioned departures, as amicus curiae argues.\"                            That statement\n\nis true as a literal matter, but it does not answer the practical\n\nquestion raised by amicus:                whether subparagraphs (i) and (ii)\n\npermit       the    courts    of    appeals        to    revisit       the     Commission's\n\ndetermination         that    a    particular      ground     for      departure         (e.g.,\n\nexceptional good works) comports with those provisions.                                     The\n\ngovernment does not directly answer that question.                                  It does,\n\nhowever, strongly oppose amicus's argument that the courts of\n\nappeals are barred from considering the purposes of sentencing, the\n\nstructure and purposes of the sentencing guidelines, or similar\n\naids in evaluating the propriety of departures in particular cases.\n\n               In the end, there is less to this dispute than meets the\n\neye.     For the reasons explained below, we agree with the defense\n\nthat     a    court    of     appeals,      in     reviewing       a    departure         under\n\n§ 3742(e)(3)(B)(i) and (ii), must accept and may not look behind\n\nthe    Sentencing       Commission's        determination          that       a   particular\n\ncategorical basis for departure is permissible or impermissible.\n\nAt    the    same     time,   we    agree    with       the   government          that    under\n\nsubparagraph (iii), a court of appeals is free to weigh the\n\npurposes of sentencing, the intentions of the Commission, and any\n\n\n                                            -48-\n\fother relevant considerations in deciding whether a particular\n\ndeparture is \"justified by the facts of the case.\"      This reading\n\nboth reaffirms the authority of the Sentencing Commission and\n\nbroadens appellate review of sentencing departures on grounds not\n\nconsidered by the Commission.\n\n             We start with the focus of an appellate court's inquiry\n\nunder § 3742(e)(3)(B).     Although most of § 3742(e) is concerned\n\nwith \"the sentence\" actually imposed, see § 3742(e) (preamble),\n\nsubsection (e)(3)(B) directs the court of appeals to focus on the\n\n\"factor\" cited by the district court as the basis for granting a\n\ndeparture.     See § 3742(e)(3)(B) (\"the sentence departs from the\n\napplicable guideline range based on a factor that . . . .\"\n\n(emphasis added)).    Amicus argues, and we agree, that the initial\n\nquestion under § 3742(e)(3)(B) is whether the district court\n\nselected a categorical basis for departure that the U.S. Sentencing\n\nCommission has considered and authorized.     Because the Commission\n\nhas already declared certain factors to be permissible grounds for\n\ndeparture,     Congress   could    not   reasonably   have   intended\n\n§ 3742(e)(3)(B) as a warrant to second-guess the Commission's\n\npolicy judgments on those matters.       If, on the other hand, the\n\ndistrict court cited as its basis for departure a factor that the\n\nCommission has not expressly considered, then the court of appeals\n\nmust make its own determinations under subparagraphs (3)(B)(i) and\n\n(ii).   Where, as here, the departure was based on a factor\n\n\n                                  -49-\n\fconsidered by the Commission (i.e., exceptional good works), de\n\nnovo review extends only to whether the departure was \"justified by\n\nthe facts of the case.\"         § 3742(e)(3)(B)(iii).\n\n            Implicit in this conclusion is an analysis of the word\n\n\"factor\" in § 3742(e)(3)(B).           That term, in this context, must be\n\nread to mean a categorical basis for departure, independent of the\n\nfacts of the case (for example, \"good works\" generally).                   The\n\nPROTECT    Act   inserted   a    new    subsection   (j)   in   §   3742   that\n\nforthrightly equates the term \"factor\" with \"ground of departure.\"19\n\nIn addition, the sentencing guidelines themselves, before the\n\nPROTECT Act, employed the word \"factor\" to refer generally to a\n\nbasis for departure.    See, e.g., U.S.S.G. § 5K2.0 (2002) (\"Grounds\n\nfor Departure\"). The Supreme Court adopted the same usage in Koon.\n\nSee, e.g., 518 U.S. at 98 (referring to \"whether a discouraged\n\nfactor nonetheless justifies departure\").            Interpreting the term\n\n\"factor\" in § 3742(e)(3)(B) to refer to a categorical basis for\n\n\n\n     19\n          Section 3742(j) provides:\n\n     (j)    Definitions. -- For purposes of this section --\n            (1) a factor is a \"permissible\" ground of\n                 departure if it –\n                 (A) advances the objectives set forth in\n                      section 3553(a)(2); and\n                 (B) is authorized under section 3553(b); and\n                 (C) is justified by the facts of the case;\n                      and\n            (2) a factor is an \"impermissible\" ground of\n                 departure if it is not a permissible factor\n                 within the meaning of subsection (j)(1).\n\n\n                                       -50-\n\fdeparture is also consistent with this court's own guidelines\n\ncases, which have frequently used the term in that way.   See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Mejia, 309 F.3d 67, 70 (1st Cir. 2002) (referring\n\nto   \"factors that are either encouraged or discouraged bases for\n\ndeparture\"); United States v. Bogdan, 284 F.3d 324, 328 (1st Cir.\n\n2002) (referring to \"factors that are explicitly or implicitly\n\nproscribed by the Sentencing Guidelines as bases for departure\").20\n\n          On the other hand, there is some support for the contrary\n\nview, inherent in the government's position, that \"factor\" refers\n\nnot to the categorical basis for departure but to the district\n\n\n     20\n        Amicus also points to evidence in the legislative history\nof the PROTECT Act that Congress was troubled by departures on\nunmentioned grounds. Representative Tom Feeney, the sponsor of the\namendment that became § 401, was particularly interested in\nlimiting such departures. Feeney stated that under the Supreme\nCourt's decision in Koon, district judges were permitted to depart\ndownward based on \"any factor not explicitly disapproved by the\nsentencing commission . . . . So judges can make up exceptions as\nthey go along.\" 149 Cong. Rec. H2422-23 (daily ed. March 27, 2003)\n(statement of Rep. Feeney).    At a different point, Rep. Feeney\nreferred to a need to prevent \"ad hoc departures based on vague\ngrounds, such as 'general mitigating circumstances.'\"       Id. at\nH2423.\n     These statements certainly illuminate one of Congress's\npurposes in the PROTECT Act, but they do not meaningfully assist\nour interpretation of § 3742(e)(3)(B).      Rep. Feeney's concerns\nabout unmentioned departures are consistent with the overarching\npurpose of the PROTECT Act to reduce the incidence of downward\ndepartures generally. Moreover, Congress apparently rejected Rep.\nFeeney's initial proposal to eliminate all departures on\nunmentioned grounds. See id. at 2420-21. And none of the parties\nhas cited, and we have not discovered, any legislative history\naddressing the specific issue here: whether Congress intended the\ncourts of appeals to engage in de novo review under subparagraphs\n(i) and (ii) of § 3742(e)(3)(B) even where the ground for departure\nselected by the district court has been expressly approved by the\nSentencing Commission.\n\n                               -51-\n\fcourt's fact-specific justification for departing in a particular\n\ncase.     For example, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), which was amended by the\n\nPROTECT Act, is entitled \"Factors to be considered in imposing a\n\nsentence\" (emphasis added), and it requires district courts to take\n\naccount     of      such     case-specific     matters     as   \"the     nature   and\n\ncircumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of\n\nthe defendant.\" § 3553(a)(1). Nevertheless, we are persuaded that\n\nthe word \"factor\" in § 3742(e)(3)(B) is better understood as a\n\nshorthand for a categorical basis for departure.                        Congress, in\n\nenacting the PROTECT Act, plainly employed the term in that way in\n\n§ 3742(j), and we hold that it intended the word to have the same\n\nmeaning in § 3742(e)(3)(B).21\n\n               It     is   also   apparent    that   Congress     did    not   intend\n\n§ 3742(e)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) as a license for the courts of appeals\n\nto second-guess the Sentencing Commission's determinations that\n\nspecific factors are permissible or impermissible.                      In Part K of\n\nChapter    5     of    the    sentencing     guidelines,    the   Commission      has\n\nidentified specific mitigating and aggravating factors that, in the\n\n\n     21\n        This interpretation is also consistent with § 3742(f),\nanother provision amended by the PROTECT Act.         That section\nestablishes the circumstances under which the court of appeals may\nremand a case for re-sentencing.       Subparagraph (2) addresses\nremands in departure cases.     In language obviously intended to\nmirror the substance of § 3742(e)(3), it permits the court of\nappeals to vacate a departure and remand if \"the district court\nfailed to provide the required statement of reasons in the order of\njudgment and commitment, or the departure is based on an\nimpermissible factor, or is to an unreasonable degree . . . .\"\n§ 3742(f)(2) (emphasis added).\n\n                                        -52-\n\fCommission's view, may justify departure.               See U.S.S.G. § 5K2.0\n\n(2002 ed.) (\"[T]his subpart seeks to aid the court by identifying\n\nsome of the factors that the Commission has not been able to take\n\ninto account fully in formulating the guidelines. . . .                  Presence\n\nof any such factor may warrant departure from the guidelines . . .\n\n.\").     The Commission has also prohibited departures based on\n\ncertain factors.       See, e.g., § 5H1.10 (race, sex, national origin,\n\ncreed, religion, and socio-economic status); § 5K1.2 (defendant's\n\nrefusal to assist authorities in investigating other persons); see\n\nalso U.S.S.G. § 5K2.0(d) (Nov. 2003 ed.) (\"Prohibited Departures\").\n\nFor appellate courts to revisit such determinations anew in every\n\ncase would undermine the authority of the Sentencing Commission,\n\nreduce   uniformity      in   sentencing,     and    risk   \"recreat[ing]      the\n\nlocation-based sentencing swings that Congress sought to minimize\n\nwhen it opted for a guideline paradigm.\"             United States v. Snyder,\n\n136 F.3d 65, 69 (1st Cir. 1998).             Prior to the PROTECT Act, the\n\nSentencing Commission's judgments were not open to such attacks.\n\nSee,   e.g.,   Koon,    518   U.S.   at   95-96     (explaining   that    if   the\n\nCommission has forbidden a particular ground of departure, \"the\n\nsentencing court cannot use it as a basis for departure\" (emphasis\n\nadded)); United States v. Rivera, 994 F.2d 942, 949 (1st Cir. 1993)\n\n(Breyer, J.) (even if forbidden factors are present to such an\n\nextent that the case is outside the relevant guideline's heartland,\n\n\n\n\n                                      -53-\n\f\"the sentencing court is not free to consider departing\").                   There\n\nis no reason to think Congress intended to change that rule.\n\n            Accordingly,    we    hold   that   where     the    Commission     has\n\nexpressly    considered     and    forbidden        or   approved       (even    if\n\ndiscouraged) a particular factor for departure, the court of\n\nappeals is bound to accept that determination and cannot revisit it\n\nunder subparagraphs (i) or (ii) of § 3742(e)(3)(B).22                        So in\n\nThurston's   case,   because      the    Commission      has    determined      that\n\ndepartures based on exceptional good works are authorized, we do\n\nnot inquire whether such departures comport with subparagraphs (i)\n\nor (ii), and instead proceed directly to the question whether the\n\ndeparture    \"is   not    justified      by   the    facts      of    the   case.\"\n\n§ 3742(e)(3)(B)(iii).\n\n            There is a second component, which we do not accept, to\n\nthe defense's interpretation of § 3742(e)(3)(B).                     Amicus argues\n\nthat in evaluating whether a departure on a particular ground is\n\n\"justified by the facts of the case\" under subparagraph (iii), this\n\ncourt may not refer to the underlying purposes of sentencing, the\n\nCommission's intent in its guidelines and policy statements, or\n\n\n\n     22\n       This conclusion is slightly different from amicus's position\nthat subparagraphs (i) and (ii) simply \"do not apply\" to mentioned\ndepartures.   There is no basis in the statute to hold those\nsubparagraphs inapplicable to certain types of departures.\nProperly framed, the question is whether a ground for departure\nendorsed by the Commission can ever fail the tests set forth in\n§ 3742(e)(3)(B)(i) and (ii).     We answer that question in the\nnegative.\n\n                                     -54-\n\fother extra-record considerations. The reason, amicus says, is the\n\nsame:      it   is   the   province   of   the      Commission       to   weigh   such\n\nconsiderations, and Congress could not have intended the court of\n\nappeals    to    re-weigh   those     issues     when      reviewing      a   specific\n\nsentencing departure.\n\n            We reject this argument for several reasons.                   First, the\n\nPROTECT Act asks whether the departure is \"justified\" by the facts\n\nof the case.          That calls for an evaluative judgment, not a\n\nmechanical exercise. See Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary 1228\n\n(1993) (\"justify\" means \"to prove or show to be just, desirable,\n\nwarranted,      or   useful\").      Nothing    in    the    statute       purports   to\n\nconstrain the sources that the reviewing court may consider.\n\nSecond, we see no serious risk that the Commission's legitimacy or\n\nauthority will be undermined if a court of appeals refers to the\n\npurposes of sentencing, the goals of the guidelines, or other\n\npolicy considerations in determining whether, on the facts before\n\nthe   court,     a   particular   defendant         fits    within    a    particular\n\ncategorical \"factor.\"23       Third, those considerations were a regular\n\n\n\n\n      23\n       Hypothetically, the Commission's statutory authority could\nbe undercut if an appellate court were to construe an approved\nbasis for departure so narrowly that, as a practical matter, no set\nof facts could ever qualify. But that circumstance is extremely\nunlikely and, in any event, is not presented here.\n\n                                      -55-\n\fpart of the test that Congress required of the courts of appeals\n\nunder § 3742(e)(3) even prior to the PROTECT Act.24\n\n             Fourth, the district court not only may but must consider\n\nthe purposes of sentencing and the Commission's relevant guidelines\n\nand policy statements when it imposes a sentence.                 See 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3553(a); see also id. § 3553(b) (\"In the absence of an applicable\n\nsentencing    guideline,     the   court      shall    impose    an    appropriate\n\nsentence, having due regard for the purposes [of sentencing] set\n\nforth in subsection (a)(2).\"). The PROTECT Act requires this court\n\nto apply de novo review under § 3742(e)(3)(B)(iii), and it would be\n\nanomalous    for   Congress   to     have     required    plenary      review    but\n\nrestricted the sources of law or fact that may inform that review.\n\nAdopting amicus's interpretation would produce the counterintuitive\n\nconclusion     that   Congress,      in    expanding     appellate      review    of\n\ndepartures in the PROTECT Act, simultaneously prevented the courts\n\nof appeals in some cases from reviewing aspects of the district\n\ncourt's reasoning. Congress could not have intended such a result.\n\n             For   similar    reasons,       we   reject    the       government's\n\nsuggestion     that    we    adopt        bright-line    rules        against    the\n\n\n     24\n       Before the PROTECT Act, § 3742(e)(3) simply required the\ncourt of appeals to determine whether the sentence imposed by the\ndistrict court was \"unreasonable\" in light of, inter alia, \"the\nfactors to be considered in imposing a sentence.\"       18 U.S.C.\n§ 3742(e)(3) (2000). Those factors, which appear in § 3553(a),\ninclude the purposes of sentencing. See, e.g., United States v.\nSmith, 14 F.3d 662, 666 (1st Cir. 1994) (referring to the\n\"sentencing system's purposes\" in rejecting a downward departure).\n\n\n                                      -56-\n\fconsideration of certain kinds of information in our exercise of de\n\nnovo review under subparagraph (3)(B)(iii).                     In particular, the\n\ngovernment urges that we cannot consult district court opinions (at\n\nleast   to   the   extent     not    tested      on    appeal)     or   databases   of\n\nsentencing decisions. Nothing in the PROTECT Act precludes us from\n\nconsidering such sources.           To be certain, experience gained under\n\nthe Act with the passage of time may show that particular kinds of\n\ninformation have greater or lesser value.                   Databases of sentencing\n\noutcomes, for example, may or may not prove pertinent, depending on\n\ntheir scope and the types of information they report.                          But we\n\ndecline to adopt any mechanical rule restricting the information\n\nthat the court may consider under § 3742(e)(3)(B)(iii).\n\n                       (d)   Deferential Review After the PROTECT Act\n\n             We also reject a final argument by the defense, said to\n\nbe drawn from Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690 (1996), that\n\nde novo review involves deference not only to the district court's\n\ndeterminations     of    historical       fact,       but   also   to   its   ultimate\n\nconclusions –- for example, whether a defendant's good works are\n\n\"exceptional.\"      It is true that in sentencing cases, \"appellate\n\nreview must occur with full awareness of, and respect for, the\n\ntrier's superior 'feel' for the case.\"                      United States v. Diaz-\n\nVillafane, 874 F.2d 43, 49-50 (1st Cir. 1989).                     We do agree that\n\nthis    court   must    defer   to    a    sentencing         court's   findings    of\n\nhistorical fact, even after the PROTECT Act.                  The Act did not alter\n\n\n                                          -57-\n\fthe provision in § 3742(e) that the district court's findings of\n\nfact must be accepted unless clearly erroneous.              See § 3742(e).\n\nOther circuits agree with this interpretation of the Act.             Mallon,\n\n345 F.3d at 946; Jones, 332 F.3d at 1300 n.9.                   Indeed, the\n\ngovernment concedes this point. To the extent amicus suggests that\n\nthe   court    of    appeals   should   defer   to   the   district   court's\n\napplication of the departure guidelines to the facts, however, its\n\nargument is refuted by the plain text of § 3742(e).               After the\n\nPROTECT Act, that kind of deference is not ours to give.\n\n              2.    The Downward Departures\n\n              The government argues that each of the stated grounds for\n\ndownward departure was in error.25          First, it contends that the\n\n\n      25\n           The court stated:\n\n           [I]n granting the motion for downward departure, I'm\n      basing it on two grounds.\n\n           First, the downward departure is justified because of the\n      defendant Thurston's record of charitable work and community\n      service[, which] is unique, extensive and extraordinary. I\n      think the record should reflect that in over fourteen years of\n      sentencing defendants, it's my judgment that no one had a more\n      extraordinary devotion to charitable work, community service,\n      and especially his dedication to his church.\n\n           And the second ground is that which is set out in the\n      United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines Manual under\n      Chapter 1, Part A, Section 3, which is entitled . . . \"The\n      Basic Approach, paren, policy statement, closed paren,\"\n      setting forth the rationale of the guidelines, it's cited here\n      that Congress sought reasonable uniformity in sentencing by\n      narrowing the wide disparity in sentences imposed for similar\n      criminal offenses committed by similar offenders.\n\n              Congress sought proportionality in sentencing through a\n\n                                    -58-\n\fdistrict    court    was   forbidden    to    depart   downward   based   on   a\n\ndisparity between Thurston's sentence and the sentence of the\n\ncompany president, a cooperating co-conspirator who pled guilty.\n\nSecond, it argues that departures for good works are discouraged,\n\nand that the facts do not justify a finding that Thurston's good\n\nworks are so exceptional as to warrant such a departure.\n\n                     (a)   Disparity With Co-Defendant\n\n            The district court felt there was an unfair disparity\n\nbetween a five-year sentence of imprisonment for Thurston and the\n\nthree-year probation sentence for co-conspirator Isola.             It viewed\n\nIsola as \"the architect, at least the prime architect of this\n\nconspiracy.\"        Apparently the district court felt that Isola,\n\nThurston's superior, was the guiltier of the two, and that this\n\nfact overshadowed other differences between their cases.                  Isola\n\npled nolo contendere to willful blindness about the apolipoprotein\n\nconspiracy.\n\n            As the law of this circuit makes clear, basing the\n\ndeparture   on   grounds    of   disparity     in   sentence   alone   between\n\n\n     system that imposes appropriately different sentences for\n     criminal conduct of differing severity.\n\n          We have a situation here where coconspirator Isola, the\n     president of Damon and the architect, at least the prime\n     architect of this conspiracy, received a sentence of three\n     years' probation, and it is, in my judgment, a violation of\n     the fundamental purpose of the Sentencing Commission\n     Guidelines to impose a sentence which is not at least somewhat\n     similar to that incurred by a coconspirator who was more\n     involved in the conspiracy t[h]an this defendant.\n\n                                       -59-\n\fThurston and Isola was beyond the district court's authority.\n\nUnited States v. Wogan, 938 F.2d 1446, 1448 (1st Cir. 1991); see\n\nalso United States v. Romolo, 937 F.2d 20, 25 n.5 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\nSidestepping circuit precedent, the district court referred to a\n\nstatute that requires a sentencing court to consider not only the\n\nCommission's Sentencing Guidelines and policy statements, but also\n\n\"the    need    to    avoid    unwarranted     sentence     disparities      among\n\ndefendants with similar records who have been found guilty of\n\nsimilar conduct.\"        18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6).           This provision was\n\nunchanged by the PROTECT Act.\n\n              Yet the same statute also requires that the court \"shall\n\nimpose a sentence of the kind, and within the range [of the\n\npertinent Guidelines], unless the court finds that there exists an\n\naggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree,\n\nnot    adequately      taken    into    consideration      by   the    Sentencing\n\nCommission.\"      18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(1).          That is why, since as early\n\nas    1991,    this   court    has   interpreted    the   statute     to   preclude\n\nsentencing judges from departing downward based on \"a perceived\n\nneed to equalize sentencing outcomes for similarly situated co-\n\ndefendants, without more.\"             Wogan, 938 F.2d at 1448 (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n              The \"more\" that is needed refers to circumstances not\n\nadequately considered by the Commission, and none have been shown\n\nhere with regard to disparity.             In the pre-guidelines era, the\n\n\n                                        -60-\n\fdistrict court's attempt to avoid perceived unfairness would have\n\nhad greater weight.       The guidelines bind us and they bind the\n\ndistrict court.      The downward departure based on disparity in\n\nsentences among co-defendants was impermissible.\n\n                    (b)   Good Works\n\n            The second ground, based on Thurston's good works, poses\n\nthe most difficult issue in the case.             We have found disparity\n\nalone an impermissible ground; it is possible the trial court would\n\nnot have granted so extensive a departure based on good works\n\nalone.    It may also be that if the court had granted a modest\n\ndeparture on the second ground, the government would not have\n\nappealed.     But the trial court did not differentiate and the\n\ngovernment on appeal argues that any departure at all based on good\n\nworks (like the departure for disparity) was contrary to law.\n\n            The sentencing guidelines discourage downward departures\n\nfrom the normal sentencing range based on good works -- that is,\n\ncivic, charitable, or public service.             U.S.S.G. § 5H1.11.        Such\n\ndepartures    are    permitted    only     when      the   good     works    are\n\n\"exceptional.\"26     See U.S.S.G. ch. 5, pt. H, introductory cmt.\n\n(departures based on discouraged factors should occur only \"in\n\nexceptional   cases\");    Koon,   518    U.S.   at   95;   United   States   v.\n\n\n     26\n        Good works may also be considered in setting a sentence\nwithin the guidelines range or in setting certain conditions. This\ndoes Thurston no good, however, since the applicable guidelines\nrange is sixty-three to seventy-eight months, all above the\nstatutory maximum of sixty months.\n\n                                   -61-\n\fPereira, 272 F.3d 76, 80 (1st Cir. 2001).     The district court based\n\nits conclusion that Thurston's good works were exceptional on\n\nThurston's \"record of charitable work and community service[, which\n\nis] unique, extensive and extraordinary.\"     The court continued, \"I\n\nthink the record should reflect that in over fourteen years of\n\nsentencing defendants, it's my judgment that no one had a more\n\nextraordinary devotion to charitable work, community service, and\n\nespecially . . . to his church.\"    Thurston is a member of a church,\n\ntithes ten percent of his income, and devotes hours every week to\n\nunpaid service with the church in a variety of positions.         Letters\n\nfrom his fellow congregants characterize him as a man of principle\n\nand impeccable character27 -– characterizations undermined, of\n\ncourse, by the jury's finding of guilt.            In any event, it is\n\nThurston's record of good works, objectively measured, and not his\n\ngood character that is at issue.\n\n          In addition to his church activities, Thurston has taken\n\nfamily members and others into his home and has been helpful to his\n\nneighbors.   For   example,   the   parents   of   a   woman   undergoing\n\nrehabilitation at a local medical center stayed at Thurston's home\n\n\n\n     27\n        During the trial, numerous witnesses for both sides\ntestified to Thurston's reputation for honesty and integrity.\nDuring the sentencing phase, many of Thurston's friends and family\nmembers explicitly or implicitly said they thought the jury verdict\nwas incorrect.\n     Good character is covered by the aberrant behavior guidelines,\nand there is no argument on appeal that Thurston was entitled to a\ndeparture on those grounds.\n\n                                -62-\n\ffor several weeks.      On another occasion, Thurston and his family\n\nlaid sod for an infirm neighbor.           Save for his crime, Thurston\n\nappears to have lived a creditworthy life.\n\n           The issue, however, is not whether Thurston engaged in\n\n\"good works\" within the meaning of § 5H1.11 -- plainly he did --\n\nbut whether those works were exceptional enough to overcome the\n\njudgment of the Sentencing Commission that a record of good works\n\nis a discouraged basis for departure -- that is, good works are\n\n\"not ordinarily relevant\" to the decision whether to depart from\n\nthe guidelines.   § 5H1.11.   We hold that a departure for good works\n\nwas not justified on the facts of this case.\n\n           This circuit, even before the PROTECT Act, reversed\n\ndepartures based on discouraged factors where the record did not\n\nindicate   that   the    defendant's      circumstances   were   genuinely\n\nexceptional. For example, in United States v. Bogdan, 284 F.3d 324\n\n(1st Cir. 2002), the defendant was a caring and generous father who\n\nhad gone out of his way to support his ex-wife and who had\n\nexpressed deep remorse for his crime.          This court concluded that\n\nBogdan's case was not so exceptional as to qualify for a downward\n\ndeparture based on either family responsibilities or acceptance of\n\nresponsibility, both of which are discouraged factors.           See id. at\n\n329-30.    When, on remand, the district court again granted a\n\ndownward   departure     because    it     thought    Bogdan's    sentence\n\n\"unconscionable,\" this court again reversed.         See United States v.\n\n\n                                   -63-\n\fBogdan, 302 F.3d 12, 15, 16-17 (1st Cir. 2002).         The Bogdan cases\n\nillustrate that the \"exceptional case\" hurdle for discouraged\n\ndepartures is a very high one.     See also Pereira, 272 F.3d at 82-83\n\n(family responsibilities departure, a discouraged factor, requires\n\na showing of something akin to irreplaceability to qualify as\n\nexceptional); United States v. Craven, 239 F.3d 91, 100 (1st Cir.\n\n2001) (departure on discouraged ground of extraordinary presentence\n\nrehabilitation requires, at a minimum, a showing of a fundamental\n\nchange in attitude).\n\n            The case law under § 5H1.11 offers little guidance as to\n\nwhen a defendant's good works may be characterized as exceptional.\n\nWhat is clear, however, is that the problem is not merely one of\n\nquantity.    The context of the defendant's good works is important.\n\nHere, Thurston's position as a prominent corporate executive weighs\n\nin   our   analysis.   It   is   hardly   surprising   that   a   corporate\n\nexecutive like Thurston is better situated to make large financial\n\ncontributions than someone for whom the expenses of day-to-day life\n\nare more pressing; indeed, business leaders are often expected, by\n\nvirtue of their positions, to engage in civic and charitable\n\nactivities.    Those who donate large sums because they can should\n\nnot gain an advantage over those who do not make such donations\n\nbecause they cannot.    See United States v. Morken, 133 F.3d 628,\n\n629-30 (8th Cir. 1998) (reversing a downward departure because the\n\ndefendant's good works were not exceptional in light of his income\n\n\n                                   -64-\n\fand preeminence in a small town); United States v. Kolbach, 38 F.3d\n\n832, 838-39 (6th Cir. 1994) (vacating a good works departure\n\nbecause \"it is usual and ordinary, in the prosecution of similar\n\nwhite collar crimes involving high-ranking corporate executives .\n\n. . to find that a defendant was involved as a leader in community\n\ncharities, civic organizations, and church efforts\" (emphasis in\n\noriginal)); United States v. McHan, 920 F.2d 244, 248 (4th Cir.\n\n1990) (similar).\n\n             Thurston's religion plays no role in our analysis of\n\nwhether his good works are exceptional.        It is a neutral fact.    Cf.\n\n§ 5H1.10 (religion is \"not relevant in the determination of a\n\nsentence\").\n\n            The purposes of the sentencing guidelines, by contrast,\n\nare highly relevant.       One of the goals of the entire guidelines\n\nregime was to minimize discrepancies in the treatment of \"white\n\ncollar\" and \"blue collar\" crimes.            Congress and the Sentencing\n\nCommission    were   clear   that   under    the   pre-guidelines   regime,\n\nsentences    for   white   collar   crimes    were   too   lenient.28   The\n\n\n     28\n        See Mary Kreiner Ramirez, Just in Crime: Guiding Economic\nCrime Reform After the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 34 Loy. U. Chi.\nL.J. 359, 372-76 (2003) (discussing the Sentencing Commission's\nconcern that white-collar crimes have been \"grossly under-\nsentenced\"); id. at 396-401 (collecting data on the under-\nsentencing of white-collar crimes and arguing that the prevalence\nof downward departures in white collar cases threatens to undermine\nthe integrity of the Sentencing Guidelines); see also Testimony of\nSentencing Commissioner Stephen Breyer Before the Senate Committee\non the Judiciary, Oct. 22, 1987, reproduced in 146 PLI/Crim 811,\n824 (1987) (\"[T]he Commission considers present sentencing\n\n                                    -65-\n\fCommission   intended   its   guidelines   and   policy   statements   to\n\n\"equalize punishments for 'white collar' and 'blue collar' crime.\"\n\nUnited States v. Rivera, 994 F.2d 942, 955 (1st Cir. 1993) (Breyer,\n\nJ.).\n\n            Against that background, the nature of Thurston's offense\n\nmitigates against concluding that his good works are \"exceptional.\"\n\nHealth care fraud is a serious crime and the federal interest in\n\ncombating    it   is   powerful.     The   federal   government   spent\n\napproximately $249 billion on Medicare in 2002.           One group has\n\nestimated that about three percent of the $1.4 trillion the country\n\nspent on health care in 2001 was lost to fraud.29           See \"A Sick\n\nBusiness,\" The Economist, June 28, 2003, at 64 (citing data from\n\nNational Health Care Anti-Fraud Association); see also National\n\n\n\npractices, in which white collar criminals receive probation more\noften than other offenders who committed crimes of comparable\nseverity, to be unfair.\"); 28 U.S.C. § 994(m) (2000) (\"The\n[Sentencing] Commission shall insure that the guidelines reflect\nthe fact that, in many cases, current sentences do not accurately\nreflect the seriousness of the offense.\"). The recent enactment of\nenhanced penalties for many white collar crimes only underscores\nCongress's disinclination towards leniency for white collar\ncriminals. See Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-204,\n§§ 801-1107, 116 Stat. 745, 800-10.\n       29\n        For other circuit court cases involving Medicare and\nMedicaid fraud, see United States v. Baxtonbrown-Smith, 278 F.3d\n1348 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (fraud exceeding two million dollars); United\nStates v. Liss, 265 F.3d 1220 (11th Cir. 2001) (kickback scheme for\nreferrals); United States v. Regueiro, 240 F.3d 1321 (11th Cir.\n2001) (fraud exceeding fifteen million dollars); United States v.\nMcClendon, 195 F.3d 598 (11th Cir. 1999) (fraud exceeding three\nmillion dollars); and United States v. Polin, 194 F.3d 863 (7th\nCir. 1999) (Medicare kickback scheme).\n\n                                   -66-\n\fHealth Care Anti-Fraud Association, Health Care Fraud, at 2,\n\navailable   at    http://www.nhcaa.org/pdf/all_about_hcf.pdf         (n.d.).\n\nHealth care fraud affects the financial integrity of programs meant\n\nto aid tens of millions of people in need of health care.              Every\n\ndollar lost to fraud is a dollar that could have provided medical\n\ncare to the elderly or the disabled.                Almost by definition,\n\nMedicare fraud is white collar fraud, most often committed by\n\neducated    people    with   responsible    jobs.     Thurston's    executive\n\nposition at Damon, which gave him the resources to undertake many\n\nof his charitable works, also enabled him to perform the crime.\n\nThat fact seriously undercuts Thurston's claim that his good works\n\nare \"exceptional\" in context.\n\n            Were it not for the statutory maximum, Thurston would\n\nhave been sentenced to imprisonment for more than five years under\n\nthe   guidelines.       Thurston's    good    works   are   admirable,   but\n\nconsidered in context, they are not so exceptional as to justify\n\nreducing the sentence for the grave crime that he committed.\n\n            The downward departure for good works is reversed.\n\n            3.    Upward Departure\n\n            The    government's    argument    that    Thurston's    conduct\n\nwarranted an upward adjustment for obstruction of justice based on\n\nperjury at trial need not be resolved, given our disposition of the\n\nother issues.        The statute caps his period of incarceration at\n\n\n\n\n                                     -67-\n\fsixty months.        It is noteworthy, though, that Thurston's testimony\n\non key matters of fact was contradicted by multiple witnesses.\n\n              4.   Fine\n\n              The government argues that the sentencing judge erred by\n\nfailing to impose a fine on Thurston in accordance with the\n\nguidelines. Thurston argued, and the district court accepted, that\n\nhe   should    not    receive   a   fine   because   that   would   create    an\n\nunacceptable       disparity    between    his   sentence   and   that   of   co-\n\ndefendant Isola.        Sentence disparity is an unacceptable basis for\n\nrefusing to impose a fine and is plain error for the reasons\n\ndiscussed earlier.\n\n              Thurston contends that the government has forfeited its\n\nargument that a fine must be imposed by failing to object after the\n\njudge ruled.       The government earlier took the position that a fine\n\nmust be imposed and also argued that the court could not refuse to\n\nimpose a fine on the basis of disparity -- the only argument\n\nThurston presented.          In these circumstances, the issue was not\n\nforfeited.         See Gallant, 306 F.3d at 1187-88 (holding that a\n\nsentencing issue was not forfeited as a result of counsel's failure\n\nto object after the court's ruling); cf. United States v. Meserve,\n\n271 F.3d 314, 325 (1st Cir. 2001) (motion to strike unnecessary to\n\npreserve evidentiary issue where party objected prior to trial\n\ncourt's ruling).          Even were this an instance of forfeiture, the\n\ndistrict court committed plain error in its rationale.\n\n\n                                      -68-\n\f             Before    this    court,    Thurston     attempts    to    defend      the\n\ndecision not to impose a fine on the basis that the statutory\n\ndefinition    of    his    crime,   which    provides    that    a   fine     may   be\n\nassigned, trumps the guidelines, which provide that a fine must be\n\nassigned     barring      special   circumstances.       The     crime   of    which\n\nThurston was convicted, 18 U.S.C. § 371, provides for a prison\n\nterm, a fine, or both.         By contrast, U.S.S.G. § 5E1.2(a) says, \"The\n\ncourt shall impose a fine in all cases, except where the defendant\n\nestablishes that he is unable to pay and is not likely to become\n\nable to pay any fine.\"          (emphasis added).       The defendant did not\n\nestablish, or even seek to establish, inability to pay.                             The\n\nsentencing judge made no finding, implicit or explicit, that\n\nThurston could not pay.         The PSR estimated that Thurston had a net\n\nworth   of   over     $1.5    million,    and   the   minimum    fine    under      the\n\nguidelines was $12,500.\n\n             Because the sentence fixed by U.S.S.G. § 5E1.2(a) is\n\nwithin the range contemplated by 18 U.S.C. § 371, the guideline is\n\nnot trumped by the statute.         See United States v. Page, 84 F.3d 38,\n\n43 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"There is no reason why the Guidelines may not\n\nmake their own classifications within the statutes, and hence\n\ndefinitions which the courts must observe, so long as these are not\n\ninternally inconsistent or in violation of the Constitution or a\n\nfederal statute.\").           Here, there is no inconsistency and the\n\ndistrict court was required to impose a fine.\n\n\n                                         -69-\n\f                             V.    CONCLUSION\n\n           Thurston's conviction is affirmed.         Thurston's sentence\n\nis   vacated;   the   downward    departure   based   on   good   works   and\n\npurported disparity is reversed; and the order that no fine be\n\nimposed is reversed.     The case is remanded for imposition of the\n\nstatutory maximum sentence of sixty months in prison and for\n\nimposition of an appropriate fine.         So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -70-\n\f",

When doctors or patients (instead of insurers) paid for the bundled LabScan, Damon provided the ferritin test for free, leading doctors to believe there was no extra charge for this test. Doctors were not told that, when Medicare paid for the bundled LabScan, Medicare was charged extra for the ferritin test. Indeed, both a letter and marketing materials indicated the added ferritin test was \"free\"; that is, that there was no charge beyond the standard LabScan charge. Those unnecessary ferritin tests were not free to Medicare. Damon charged Medicare roughly $21 per ferritin test on top of the approximately $24 charged for the LabScan. Nor were doctors told that the ferritin test could be ordered separately; the test requisition form did not offer that option. The physicians, then, were induced to order and to certify as medically necessary a large number of ferritin tests that were not medically necessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's theory was that Damon did this to offset Medicare's 1988 reduction in reimbursement rates of sixteen percent, which was projected to cause Damon an estimated annual loss of $800,000 in revenues. In just one of Thurston's labs, the orders for ferritin tests were expected to increase from approximately three hundred per month to roughly ten thousand per month. Thurston testified that he was innocent, and that he neither had knowledge of nor responsibility for key components of the conspiracy. The jury disagreed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the sentencing guidelines called for a sentence of sixty-three to seventy-eight months, the district court sentenced Thurston to only three months' imprisonment. It did so by granting a downward departure to \"correct\" a perceived disparity between a five-year sentence of imprisonment for Thurston and the sentence of three years' probation given to the company president, Joseph Isola, who had pled nolo contendere and assisted the government. Its second ground for departure was its sense that the good works Thurston did for his church and community were extraordinary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This sentence outraged the prosecutors, who appealed, arguing that the district court lacked the power to depart downward for any of the reasons it gave, and that, even if a departure were appropriate, the extent of the departure was excessive. The government also appeals the district court's failure to impose a fine, on the basis that the sentencing guidelines, if not the statute, mandated a fine. Finally, the prosecution argues that if some departure for good works was warranted, the district court was required to address an issue it avoided: the government's request for an upward departure on the ground that Thurston had obstructed justice by committing perjury on the witness stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston also appeals, arguing that the conviction must be vacated because the prosecution was barred by the statute of limitations, because he was entitled to a jury instruction and to acquittal on the basis that he reasonably interpreted the law to mean he could rely on the physicians' certifications of medical necessity, and because of other errors. In addition, Thurston argues that his sentence was too high because his base offense level calculation depended on an amount of loss, either actual or intended, that was unproven and excessive. Thurston also defends the downward departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several important issues are raised by these appeals. The government's appeal requires us to address the effect of the new Prosecutorial Remedies and Tools Against the Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003 (PROTECT Act), Pub.L. No. 108-21, 117 Stat. 650,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> on the standard that the courts of appeals use to review downward departure decisions by district judges in sentencing, as well as the availability of a downward departure for a record of good works under U.S.S.G. &#167; 5H1.11. Thurston's appeal invites, <i>inter alia,</i> clarification of the defense doctrine concerning a defendant's reasonable interpretation of the law; the issue of when a statute of limitations defense must be raised; the ramifications of a trial judge's failure to respond to jury instructions proposed by counsel; the evidence needed to show an intended loss; and the question whether fines are mandatory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end we sustain the conviction but find that the sentence was in error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.

Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Medicare provides certain medical services and care, including clinical laboratory testing services, to persons aged sixty-five and older and to persons with disabilities. At the time of the conspiracy, Medicare was administered by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. HCFA in turn contracted with private insurance companies (\"carriers\" and \"intermediaries\") to handle claims for reimbursement to Medicare program beneficiaries. By law, Medicare only reimburses clinical laboratory services if those services were medically necessary for the treatment or diagnosis of a beneficiary's illness or injury. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395y(a)(1)(A) (2000); <i>see also</i> 42 C.F.R. &#167; 424.10(a) (1988). Medicare did not generally reimburse screening tests. Medicare reimbursed one-hundred percent of the cost of necessary clinical blood tests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Damon was, at the time, a Massachusetts corporation that provided clinical laboratory testing services to physicians, hospitals, health maintenance organizations, and their patients nationwide. Approximately thirty percent of Damon's revenues were from Medicare. Damon owned and operated a national system of clinical laboratories, and Damon was an approved Medicare provider. When Damon billed the Medicare program, it submitted to the carriers a HCFA 1500 form saying that it certified the lab tests were medically necessary. Physicians did not see those bills.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston served as Regional Vice President of Damon from 1987 to 1990, and was responsible during all or part of this time for Damon's regional laboratories in Newbury Park, California; Phoenix; Chicago; and San Francisco. His office was at the Newbury Park lab; he traveled to the other labs and was in regular phone contact. Thurston was promoted to Senior Vice President of Operations in 1990. Thereafter, he relocated to the company headquarters in Needham, Massachusetts and supervised only the San Francisco lab. Another company purchased Damon in August 1993; Thurston later switched employers and moved to Utah.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Theories of Prosecution and Defense</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's theory was that the defendants tricked doctors into ordering medically unnecessary tests, for which Medicare paid. Damon added little-used tests to more popular panels of tests; it then tricked doctors by concealing that the panels could be ordered without the added tests and that Medicare was being charged for the tests. To conceal from doctors that Medicare was being charged, and to encourage doctors to order ferritin tests regardless of medical necessity, the defendants charged doctors and patients little or no extra fee for the added tests; provided literature saying that ferritin was provided free; otherwise failed to disclose to doctors the cost to Medicare of the expanded LabScan; and made it difficult to order the bundled test without ferritin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defense theories were that there was no conspiracy and, if there were, that Thurston was not a knowing participant. The defense contended that Damon complied with existing Medicare regulations, which neither prohibited bundling nor imposed a requirement on the lab to disregard a physician's certification that tests were medically necessary. It further argued that even if Thurston's interpretation of the regulations was incorrect, it was objectively reasonable, and so Thurston lacked the required criminal intent. Thurston's defense was also that any fraud was carried out by his subordinates, without his knowledge. He testified that he did not instruct the labs to add ferritin; did not authorize or condone any decision to forego a fee increase for doctors or private-pay patients on the expanded LabScan; did not instruct subordinates to conceal that doctors could order a LabScan without ferritin; and had nothing to do with requisition forms or particular pieces of marketing literature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Evidence of Conspiracy to Defraud</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Addition of Ferritin</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late 1987, HCFA announced that effective April 1, 1988, Medicare would reduce by almost sixteen percent the fees paid to laboratories, including Damon, for providing clinical laboratory services to beneficiaries. If Damon maintained its existing practices and fee structure, then Damon would lose $800,000 in revenues during the first year alone, as Thurston knew. Of that amount, more than $500,000 of the annual losses would occur at Thurston's four regional laboratories.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There were corporate discussions, which included Thurston, about how to offset this loss. As a result, Damon added its ferritin test to the LabScan, a panel of more than a dozen blood chemistry tests performed by a single machine on one blood sample. The ferritin test was performed on separate equipment. Damon bundled ferritin with the LabScan from 1988 to at least mid 1993. The LabScan had been requested on at least thirty-five to forty percent of the orders submitted to Thurston's regional laboratories. By contrast, doctors rarely ordered the ferritin test. The general manager of one of the laboratories Thurston oversaw estimated that only one to two percent of the orders for blood tests included a request for a ferritin test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in the medical literature at the time showed ferritin was necessary for all persons receiving LabScans. Indeed, it was not. A family practitioner testified that he needed ferritin less than ten percent of the time it was included as part of the LabScan. Similarly, an internist testified that he needed the ferritin test for very few of his Medicare patients.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plan to add ferritin to the LabScan was discussed at a general managers meeting in January 1988 and at a mid-year financial meeting for the western region in March 1988. Thurston attended both meetings. In late March, Thurston personally approved the addition of ferritin to the LabScans offered by the Newbury Park, San Francisco, and Phoenix labs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Thurston initially acquiesced when the Phoenix lab sought permission not to add ferritin; in August 1988, however, after Thurston saw the financial results from the addition of ferritin at his other labs, Thurston ordered the Phoenix lab to add the test to the LabScan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston presented evidence that the decision to add ferritin was made at a lower level for legitimate reasons. Thurston and Isola testified that at the general managers meeting in early 1988, management decided to allow individual laboratories to determine whether to add ferritin to the LabScan. There was also testimony that Damon's sales force made requests to the sales managers and general managers of individual labs to add ferritin to the LabScan, on the grounds that the new test would make the panel more competitive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Differential Charging for Ferritin Test</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) <i>Thurston's Knowledge of Price Differential</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Medicare provided one reimbursement for the ferritin test and a separate reimbursement for the LabScan panel. In 1988, for example, Medicare paid $24.05 for a LabScan and $20.86 for a ferritin test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston's labs submitted to him capital expenditure requests (CERs) to help with the decision whether to bundle the tests. CERs were financial projections comparing the additional revenues (from Medicare reimbursements) and costs (partly from the purchase of new equipment) that would result from the addition of ferritin to the LabScan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> These CERs assumed there would be no increase in the charge to doctors and patients for a LabScan with ferritin. Thurston discussed and then signed the CERs. They projected losses of revenue from doctors and patients (who would receive free ferritin tests) and massive increases in revenue from Medicare reimbursements. One lab, for example, projected that the number of ferritin tests performed for Medicare beneficiaries would grow from 25 per month to 1,946 per month &#8212; increasing revenues by $10,308 per month. Overall, Thurston's labs projected that they would increase their Medicare reimbursements by approximately $1.16 million per year by adding ferritin to the LabScan; if multiplied by five years, this increase would be $5.8 million. The capital expenditure requests were best-case projections, assuming that every doctor who would otherwise have ordered a LabScan without ferritin would now order a LabScan with ferritin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Damon sought reimbursement (at different rates) for ferritin tests from Medicare, CHAMPUS,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> and other insurers, but provided them for free to doctors and patients. Thurston said he was unaware doctors were not being charged. But Thurston approved the decision by a number of his labs to adopt this policy of differential pricing depending on the client, and the CERs assumed no price increase for doctors and patients. Thurston instructed a subordinate to add ferritin at no charge to doctors; Thurston was present at a meeting in which another executive announced the no-charge policy; and Thurston received a memo saying that there was no price increase for doctors at a lab he oversaw. Witnesses testified that physicians are highly price-sensitive about charges for lab work and might object to the automatic inclusion of ferritin unless the test were provided for free. At least initially, many or all of Thurston's labs increased the charge to private insurance companies for a LabScan based on the addition of ferritin. However, any price increase for private insurers on the expanded LabScan was much smaller than the cost increase to Medicare.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston presented evidence that two of his labs did increase the price for physicians; that this price increase provoked complaints by doctors; that he was informed of these complaints; and that he responded that doctors could not obtain a LabScan with ferritin unless they paid the higher price. He also presented evidence that the no-charge approach was a deviation from corporate policy and was initiated by the heads of individual labs; that he did not find out about any price differential until years after it had been implemented; and that he sought to correct any price differential as soon as he discovered it. Thurston testified that he did not authorize, condone, or ratify a decision not to increase the price of the LabScan based on the addition of ferritin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) <i>Concealing Price Differential from Doctors</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston's labs took steps to conceal from doctors that, in addition to the LabScan charge, Medicare would pay an extra fee for the ferritin tests. No letters were sent to doctors advising them that Medicare would be charged separately for the ferritin test. To the contrary, in April and May 1988, letters were sent to physicians notifying them that the ferritin test was going to be automatically added at \"no extra cost.\" In Newbury Park, stickers were also printed and added to physicians' brochures and directories saying, \"Ferritin Automatically Included at No Charge.\" Of course, as to Medicare patients, these statements were untrue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston testified that he did not pre-approve the letters or stickers saying ferritin would be provided free to customers. Thurston portrayed himself as a hands-off manager who trusted subordinates to build in a charge to physicians and to accurately promote the expanded LabScan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several physicians testified they were initially unaware that Damon charged Medicare for the ferritin component of the expanded LabScan. A number of Damon customers protested, and even switched labs, when they belatedly discovered Damon was charging Medicare for ferritin tests conducted as part of the LabScan. When doctors told Damon sales representatives that they did not need the additional test, some were told that a LabScan without ferritin would cost more than a LabScan with ferritin. A major client referred Damon to a newspaper article criticizing the practice of bundling tests into panels and profiles, and warned Damon that its failure to educate doctors about the composition of and alternatives to its panels would subject it to ongoing criticism. Thurston was informed of these complaints, which were written up in monthly management reports he received in 1989 and 1990. Despite these complaints, Thurston did not cause a letter to be sent to doctors informing them of the extra charge for ferritin to Medicare.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Damon also collaborated with HMOs operating on a capitation basis (i.e., paying a flat monthly fee for each HMO member) to reduce utilization of bundled tests such as the LabScan. For example, one of Thurston's labs added to its HMO requisition form a checkbox for a LabScan without ferritin. Damon made no such effort to assist Medicare.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Availability of LabScan Without Ferritin</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston instructed subordinates to take specific steps that hid the fact that the LabScan could be ordered without ferritin and made it difficult for doctors to order the LabScan separately. For example, Thurston told the general manager of the Newbury Park lab not to advertise or promote the fact that doctors could still order a LabScan without ferritin. Similarly, Thurston helped make the decision to omit, from the Newbury Park letter announcing to doctors the addition of ferritin to the LabScan, the test code for ordering a LabScan without ferritin. The standard requisition forms used by Thurston's labs did not change following the addition of ferritin to the LabScan; there was a checkbox for the \"LabScan\" (which now included ferritin) but no box for the \"LabScan without ferritin\" or the \"LabScan with ferritin.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the conspiracy period, there were at least two ways for doctors to order the LabScan without ferritin. They could handwrite such an order on a standard requisition form, or they could request and obtain a customized requisition form with a checkbox for the LabScan without ferritin. A number of doctors and institutions took advantage of these options.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston testified that he did not tell anyone to conceal or refrain from advertising that the LabScan could be ordered without ferritin. There was testimony that, after Thurston learned in 1991 that the front of a requisition form used by one of his labs did not disclose the inclusion of ferritin in the LabScan, he instructed a subordinate to list it on the front and the form was so amended.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. <i>Apolipoprotein</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Damon also added an apolipoprotein test to its coronary risk panel in 1989. Before apolipoprotein was added to the panel, clients ordered it very rarely. The standard requisition forms Damon used after adding apolipoprotein to the panel also did not offer a checkbox for a coronary risk panel without apolipoprotein. Following the addition of apolipoprotein, the cost to doctors of the coronary risk panel increased by five dollars. Medicare reimbursed apolipoprotein separately at a rate well above five dollars. Thurston participated in the decisions about the addition, the requisition forms for, and the extra charges for apolipoprotein.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. Thurston's \"Reasonable Interpretation\" as Evidence of Lack of Criminal Intent</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston presented evidence that from 1988 to 1993 it was an industry-wide practice for labs to rely on the doctors who ordered tests to make determinations of medical necessity. Because, prior to 1994, doctors did not normally share their diagnoses with labs, labs did not have the information required to gauge medical necessity. Damon employees did not believe that they certified tests as medically necessary when they submitted HCFA 1500 forms with Medicare bills. Instead, they believed it was the doctors who ordered LabScans who made the certification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two expert witnesses testified that it was appropriate in 1988 to include ferritin in a blood chemistry panel. The bundling of different tests into panels was lawful under Medicare regulations. There was testimony that technological changes during the 1980s made it possible to automate the ferritin test, which presumably made it much cheaper to conduct. Witnesses for both sides testified that by 1988 some of Damon's competitors offered ferritin as part of their blood chemistry panel and so Damon added the test to stay competitive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Indictment and Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 22, 1998, a thirty-nine paragraph single-count indictment charged Thurston and three other former Damon executives &#8212; Joseph Isola, Beno Kon, and Gerald Cullen &#8212; with conspiring to defraud HCFA in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> by causing doctors to order unnecessary tests by adding a test for ferritin to a preexisting panel of diagnostic blood tests, and by adding a test for apolipoproteins to a profile used to assess coronary artery disease. The conspiracy period was from July 1987 to August 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Isola, President of Damon, pled no contest and, pursuant to his plea agreement, was sentenced to three years' probation and a one-hundred dollar special assessment. Kon, Corporate Controller, died during the proceedings. Cullen, Senior Vice President for Operations, was tried before the district court in October 2001 and acquitted at the close of the government's evidence. In addition, Damon pled guilty on October 11, 1996 to conspiracy to defraud by bundling ferritin with the LabScan and apolipoprotein with the cardiac risk panel. The company was sentenced to pay a $35,273,141 fine, and later entered into a civil settlement under which it paid the United States and the state Medicaid programs an additional $83,756,904.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston was tried before a jury in November and December 2001. The trial lasted three weeks. At the close of the government's evidence, the district court granted Thurston's motion for judgment of acquittal as to the indictment's apolipoprotein allegations, ordered these allegations stricken, and explained to the jury that only the ferritin allegations remained. The jury found Thurston guilty. Thurston's subsequent motions for judgment of acquittal and for a new trial were denied. The procedural rulings at trial that Thurston attacks are described below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court sentenced Thurston to three months' imprisonment (with a judicial recommendation that the term be served in a halfway house), followed by twenty-four months of supervised release (of which the first three months were to be served in home detention). The court imposed a one-hundred dollar special assessment and no fine. The Pre-Sentence Report (PSR) had recommended a Total Offense Level of twenty-six and a Criminal History Category of one. The PSR identified the base offense level as six. It recommended a fourteen-level upward enhancement for an intended loss of at least five million dollars; a two-level enhancement for more than minimal planning; and a four-level enhancement for a leadership role. It also suggested that an enhancement for obstruction of justice was appropriate, on the grounds that Thurston perjured himself at his trial. The PSR recommended the statutory maximum term of sixty months' imprisonment and noted that both the statute and the guideline allowed for a fine. It calculated that Thurston had a net worth of $1,526,904.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defense contested the PSR's recommendations. Thurston requested a three-level decrease because the substantive offense of defrauding the United States was incomplete; a four-level decrease because Thurston was a minimal participant; and a two-level decrease for acceptance of responsibility. Thurston requested a downward departure on the grounds that he had an extraordinary record of charitable work and community service; that the offense constituted aberrant behavior; and that there was the potential for a large disparity with Isola's sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argued that Thurston should receive a two-level upward enhancement for obstruction of justice. Otherwise, it accepted the recommendations of the PSR. The parties agreed that any restitution had been made by Damon, the corporate defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court sentenced Thurston at a hearing on June 26, 2002 to three months' imprisonment, a period of supervised release, and no fine. The district court granted a fourteen-level enhancement for the size of the intended loss, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 2F1.1(b)(0) (1992 version),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> a four-level enhancement for an aggravated role in the offense, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(a) (1992 version), and a two-level enhancement for more than minimal planning, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 2F1.1(b)(2) (1992 version). The court did not explicitly rule on the government's request for an obstruction of justice enhancement, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1 (1992 version), or Thurston's request for a three-level decrease for failure to show completion of the substantive offense, <i>see</i> &#167; 2X1.1 (1992 version). Thurston's adjusted offense level of twenty-six and criminal history category of one yielded a guidelines sentencing range of sixty-three to seventy-eight months' imprisonment; this range was trumped by the statutory maximum of sixty months for a violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the hearing, the government confirmed that Thurston had been offered (and had rejected) a plea agreement \"along the lines\" of the one that Isola had accepted. Over the government's objections and arguments, the district court then departed downward on the basis of Thurston's record of charitable work and community service and the disparity between Thurston's and Isola's sentences. The court then solicited the government's recommendation about the extent of the departure. The government responded that, if the court chose to depart, then it should depart no further than the sentencing guidelines for a perjury conviction, which would be an offense level of twenty (six less than that of the underlying offense), for a sentencing range of thirty-three to forty-one months' imprisonment. The court then departed by at least sixteen levels.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government appealed the sentence and Thurston appealed his conviction and sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. THURSTON'S APPEAL FROM HIS CONVICTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston was convicted under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371, which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If two or more persons conspire either to commit any offense against the United States, or to defraud the United States, or any agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose, and one or more of such persons do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy, each shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Statute of Limitations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston argues that the trial court erred in not granting his post-verdict Rule 29 motion for acquittal, because the government had not proved an overt act during the limitations period, and in not sua sponte instructing the jury on the statute of limitations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute of limitations for 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371 crimes is the general five-year statute of limitations contained in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3282. Here, that five years ran back from January 22, 1998, the date of the indictment, less the six weeks during which Thurston agreed to toll the limitations period. The government, therefore, had to prove an overt act was done on or after December 11, 1992. The indictment properly alleged at least eight overt acts within the limitations period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston did not raise the defense of statute of limitations either before or at trial, did not request an instruction on the defense, and did not object when the judge instructed without addressing the issue. Thurston first raised the issue by Rule 29 motion after the verdict. The government says Thurston raised the issue too late. There is a preliminary question of when such a motion should be raised, a question affecting our standard of review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The statute of limitations is a defense and must be asserted on the trial by the defendant in criminal cases....\" <i>Biddinger v. Comm'r of Police,</i> 245 U.S. 128, 135, 38 S.Ct. 41, 62 L.Ed. 193 (1917). Here the indictment adequately pled facts to establish that the crime was within the limitations period. Thurston was not required to raise the defense before trial under Rule 12(b)(3), Fed. R. Crim P. Nor would it have made sense for him to do so, since the defense depended on what the government proved or failed to prove at trial. In a criminal case a defendant need only plead as to the accusation of guilt in the indictment and need not raise the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense before trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Thurston mistakes these truisms for an argument that he need not raise the limitations defense at all before the jury delivers a verdict of guilt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government says Thurston has waived<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> the issue and may not raise it at all. Absent an explicit agreement to waive the defense, we treat the issue as a forfeiture and not a waiver, contrary to the government's argument. This was not an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right, the definition of a waiver. The issue of failure to assert the defense was viewed as forfeiture in <i>United States v. O'Bryant,</i> 998 F.2d 21, 23 n. 1 (1st Cir.1993). The rule we use &#8212; that the defense of statute of limitations must be raised at trial and, if not, is forfeited but not waived &#8212; is the rule in most circuits. <i>See United States v. Ross,</i> 77 F.3d 1525, 1536 (7th Cir.1996) (\"[I]t is widely accepted that a statute of limitations defense is forfeited if not raised at the trial itself.\") (citing cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston has indeed forfeited<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> the defense that the government did not prove facts that an overt act occurred within the limitations period. The defense should have been raised at trial. Waiting until after the jury has rendered a verdict of guilt to raise a limitations defense for the first time is inconsistent with the characterization of the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense and would unfairly sandbag the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because this was a forfeiture and not a waiver, there is still plain error review available under Fed.R.Crim.P. 52. <i>See United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Our conclusion is straightforward. The government's evidence established overt acts by the conspirators within the limitations period, so there was no error at all as to the statute of limitations, much less plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government showed that labs overseen by Thurston (and his co-conspirators) submitted tens of thousands of reimbursement claims to Medicare after December 11, 1992 for ferritin tests conducted as part of LabScan orders. The government also presented ample evidence that many of these tests were medically unnecessary and were submitted by doctors unaware that Medicare would be charged separately for ferritin.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> It was not credible that the ferritin test, ordered less than two percent of the time, suddenly became medically necessary thirty to forty percent of the time within the life span of the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston also argues he was entitled to a jury instruction on the limitations point. By failing to request a jury instruction and failing to object to the lack of an instruction, he has forfeited the argument. Fed.R.Crim.P. 30; <i>see United States v. Gallant,</i> 306 F.3d 1181, 1187 (1st Cir.2002) (\"[A] party unhappy with a trial court's jury instruction [must] promptly state the precise objection after the instruction has been given.\"). As there was no error, the plain error standard was not met. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 30, 52(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Purported Lack of Criminal Intent and the Requested Reasonable Interpretation Instruction</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Procedurally, the issue of reasonable interpretation comes up in two ways: denial of Thurston's Rule 29 motions and denial of his request for a jury instruction. Thurston's three Rule 29 motions &#8212; at the end of the government's case, at the end of the defense case, and after the verdict &#8212; all argued that he lacked the needed criminal intent. Our review is of whether a rational fact finder could conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the government proved the elements of the crime, including intent. <i>United States v. Moran,</i> 312 F.3d 480, 487 (1st Cir.2002). Thurston also requested a jury instruction on reasonable interpretation of the law<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> and preserved his objection to the court's rejection of the instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston argued he reasonably interpreted the law as requiring that the treating physician, not the test lab, certify to the HCFA that the test ordered was medically necessary and reasonable, and that he and the company were entitled to rely on that physician certification. Specifically, Thurston contended that in the relevant time period an independent clinical lab did not violate any aspect of Medicare law by: (1) providing physicians with a panel containing a ferritin test, so long as the physician was given reliable and accurate information about the test and could select the panel without the test; or (2) submitting a reimbursement claim, using a HCFA form or otherwise, so long as a physician ordered the test performed. This is one of his primary arguments on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether a particular defense doctrine is germane depends on the crime charged and the facts of the case. This is where Thurston's argument falters. He argues that he could not have had the needed intent because employees of clinical labs, including Thurston, \"were unaware that they were actually certifying the medical necessity of each test performed for every patient\" and they could reasonably interpret the law to mean that the treating physician, not the laboratory, made the certification. The argument is beside the point.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston was not charged with making a false statement to the United States, the falsity of which turned on an ambiguity in what the law required. Nor was he charged with failing to make a statement required by law in a situation of parallel ambiguity. He was not charged with falsely certifying the medical necessity of the tests ordered. He was charged with the crime of conspiracy to defraud the United States by inducing physicians through deceit and trickery into certifying tests as medically necessary when the ferritin tests were not necessary, thus leading Medicare to pay for unnecessary services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston's knowledge of the Medicare regulations and of the fact that the ordering physicians would certify the medical necessity of the tests was, ironically, part of the proof of the crime, not a defense. Thurston cannot, under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371, knowingly conspire to mislead and manipulate doctors into certifying medically unnecessary tests which led to improper payment of Medicare funds and then defend on the basis that he committed no fraud because the doctors, not he, were the ones who certified the tests as necessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston's reliance on <i>United States v. Prigmore,</i> 243 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.2001), is misplaced. <i>Prigmore</i> is part of a line of cases charging false statements or failure to make required statements, holding that intent should be measured against an objectively reasonable understanding of the legal requirements to be met, and that a statement is not in fact false or fraudulent if it is based on an objectively reasonable interpretation of that legal requirement. <i>See id.</i> at 17-18. This court first applied this principle in <i>United States v. Rowe,</i> 144 F.3d 15, 21-23 (1st Cir.1998), to a statement that was not in fact false under an objectively reasonable interpretation of a disclosure requirement. In <i>Prigmore,</i> the conspiracy charged was to defraud and impair the functioning of the Food and Drug Administration, in connection with its oversight and regulation of medical devices, through failure to file reports which were required under certain conditions. The fraud alleged was the failure to submit a pre-market approval information supplement to the FDA, but whether such a supplement was required depended on the interpretation of certain regulations. The same conditional requirement was true of certain testing reports. The question was whether defendants could objectively and reasonably understand one regulatory phrase, \"affecting the safety or effectiveness of the device,\" as being circumscribed by another regulatory phrase, \"intended ... conditions of use.\" <i>See</i> 243 F.3d at 15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No similar question was presented here. Here, the underlying crime was one of manipulating doctors into making false certifications so Damon could receive unwarranted Medicare payments. There is no material question about ambiguity in the underlying legal requirements and no germane question about the meaning of the law. There was also no issue of lack of fair notice of what the law requires, a concern underlying the <i>Prigmore/Rowe</i> line of cases. A reasonable person knows it is wrong to trick others into doing something wrong that one does not do directly oneself, especially in order to obtain personal gain. The <i>Prigmore</i> doctrine has no application given the crimes charged and the facts involved. Because the nature of the crime charged made the reasonable interpretation doctrine irrelevant, the jury instruction issue disappears.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Failure of District Court to Respond To Requested Instructions</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston argues that the district court violated Rule 30, Fed.R.Crim.P., which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) In General. Any party may request in writing that the court instruct the jury on the law as specified in the request. The request must be made at the close of the evidence or at any earlier time that the court reasonably sets. When the request is made, the requesting party must furnish a copy to every other party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) Ruling on a Request. The court must inform the parties before closing arguments how it intends to rule on the requested instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston is correct: the district court failed to inform the parties of how it intended to rule on each of the requested instructions before closing arguments, as required by the rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A description of the interactions of court and counsel sets the stage. Each side submitted extensive requests for instructions, and there were disagreements.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> The court did resolve the most serious disputes over some of the instructions (for instance, on the reasonable interpretation/<i>Prigmore</i> question) and told counsel these rulings before closing argument. The court did not, though, review all of the requests. Thurston's counsel did not object to this silence before giving his closing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defense counsel did raise an issue after closing, and before the jury was instructed, that he wanted to put on record his specific objections to the government's requests. He did not say he had been prejudiced in any way by the court's failure to rule on the requested instructions before he gave his closing. The court replied that it would neither rule on nor hear argument on the proposed instructions. Rather, the court stated its understanding that the appropriate time to object was at the end of the instructions. Nonetheless, it did hear argument on the government's Request No. 8 (the compelled witness rule), and declined to give the instruction. It also heard argument on the government's proposed instructions No. 18 (conspiracy); No. 19 (unlawful objectives); and No. 22 (overt act). The only proposed defense instruction called to the court's attention was No. 24, on missing witnesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not, as Rule 30 requires, tell counsel before closing argument its disposition of all of the requested instructions. But counsel for Thurston had an obligation to bring this to the court's attention before the closing and did not do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without addressing the issue of whether Thurston has thus forfeited the Rule 30 argument, we choose to simply evaluate whether defense counsel's closing argument was adversely affected. <i>See United States v. Owens,</i> 167 F.3d 739, 753 (1st Cir.1999). It was not. One telling indicium that there was no prejudice is that trial counsel did not ever say to the court he would be prejudiced if he had to proceed with his closing without knowing the court's disposition of the remaining requested instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An even more telling indicium of lack of prejudice is that Thurston's appellate counsel has been unable to identify any specific areas of prejudice occasioned by the trial court's lapse. While in theory such a lapse could cause prejudice, the most that is argued here is that there was \"no detailed reference to important legal concepts regarding criminal conspiracy and the state of mind by which Thurston would be judged.\" Appellate counsel does not identify those \"important legal concepts,\" and we see none. As to Thurston's state of mind, the trial judge did instruct on the government's burden to show Thurston had a specific intent to participate in the conspiracy and to defraud the United States. The court instructed the jury to consider Thurston individually to determine if he willfully joined the conspiracy. The court, in turn, defined \"willfully.\" The court also explicitly rejected Thurston's reasonable interpretation instruction, and it instructed on good faith. These circumstances belie any claim of prejudice and Thurston's claim fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. Motion for New Trial Based on Dismissal of Apolipoprotein Charge</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston and his co-defendants were originally charged with conspiracy to commit fraud as to both the ferritin and the apolipoprotein tests. At the close of the government's case the court granted Thurston's motion for judgment of acquittal on the apolipoprotein test, struck those references from the indictment, and instructed the jury that this issue was no longer before it. The government did not thereafter refer to this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston now argues that the court should have granted Thurston a new trial after the jury returned because the apolipoprotein evidence irretrievably tainted the trial. The government rejoins that counsel should have raised the issue sooner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again, we bypass the issue of forfeiture and reject the argument that dismissal of the apolipoprotein charges tainted the proceedings. Thurston's argument that none of this evidence would have been admitted if the ferritin charges were tried alone is based on an unlikely premise. Where the evidence admitted as to a dismissed count would have been admissible as to a remaining count, the defendant has not suffered prejudice. <i>United States v. Rooney,</i> 37 F.3d 847, 855-56 (2d Cir.1994) (collecting cases); <i>see United States v. Weiner,</i> 3 F.3d 17, 22 (1st Cir.1993) (jury properly considered evidence relating to counts dismissed prior to verdict, since evidence was relevant to remaining counts).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government would have introduced such evidence in any event as relevant to rebut central defense themes that, because Damon had such a decentralized decision-making structure, Thurston was not involved in key decisions. The apolipoprotein evidence contradicted Thurston's claims about the extent and consequences of Damon's decentralized approach to the make-up, pricing, and marketing of its panels.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was little risk of prejudice for other reasons. The government did not mention the apolipoprotein evidence in its closing, and exhibits pertaining only to apolipoprotein were removed before the documents were submitted to the jury. Further, most of the testimony and documentary evidence in the first half of the case, before the court ruled on the Rule 29 motion, dealt with ferritin. These factors further minimized the likelihood of any taint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston's conviction is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. SENTENCING APPEALS</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Thurston's Appeal: Loss Calculation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Much of Thurston's guidelines sentence range (sixty-three to seventy-eight months) was driven by the loss calculation. Both the PSR and the government recommended an intended loss figure of more than five million dollars but less than ten million dollars. This resulted in a fourteen-level increase in the base offense level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston, not surprisingly, targets this loss calculation. He makes two arguments. The first is that the government was precluded by a comment to U.S.S.G. &#167; 2F1.1 from ever relying on intended loss unless the government first established what the actual loss was and then established that the intended loss was greater. This is a pure issue of guidelines interpretation, which we review de novo. <i>See United States v. Gonzalez-Alvarez,</i> 277 F.3d 73, 77 (1st Cir.2002). The second argument is that the court's conclusion had insufficient factual support for a number of reasons, a contention reviewed for clear error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The guidelines interpretation argument turns on a comment that provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consistent with the provisions of &#167; 2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation or Conspiracy), if an intended loss that the defendant was attempting to inflict can be determined, this figure will be used if it is greater than the actual loss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 2F1.1, cmt. n. 7 (Fraud and Deceit) (1992 version).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston argues that because the government did not show actual loss, it cannot turn to intended loss. The argument is simply wrong as a matter of the wording of the comment. The comment directs the use of an intended loss figure when it is greater than the actual loss figure; the comment does not restrict the sentencing court's ability to rely on intended loss when there is no actual loss calculation available. Defendant's reading also makes little sense: it may be easier as a matter of proof to show intended loss than actual loss. Conspirators are held accountable for the loss they intend to commit. Finally, it is obvious on these facts that the intended loss was greater than the actual loss &#8212; some doctors quit using Damon when, to their disgust, they realized what the scheme was.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston next mounts a series of fact-based attacks on the intended loss figure of more than five million dollars. That figure is supported by the capital expenditure requests each of the labs prepared to obtain funding to buy the equipment needed to perform the increased ferritin testing the labs anticipated. Each CER included a financial analysis, one component of which was the estimated new revenue from bundling the tests. Thus, the intended loss calculation was based on the conspirators' own financial calculations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston argues the CERs, being mere financial projections, are not an adequate basis for an intended loss figure; that the CERs were based on an assumed best-case scenario in which no physician who ordered LabScans would decline to get ferritin tests; that, in any event, not all physicians who ordered the bundled test were tricked into doing so; that the conspiracy was not proven to last five years; that the conspiracy ended before five years had elapsed for several labs, given the different dates on which the labs bundled the tests; and that later, only one lab reported to Thurston.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A number of these are quickly dispatched. The jury verdict of guilt disposes of the question of the length of the conspiracy. Thurston's promotion out of management of three of the labs is irrelevant since he earlier conspired to produce losses intended to go on for years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston also argues that the intended loss had to be reduced under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2X1.1(b)(2) because the government's proof did not establish that the conspirators had \"completed all the acts the conspirators believed necessary on their part for the successful completion of the substantive offense.\" <i>Id.</i> There is no merit to the argument. There was successful completion of the offense: the tests were bundled and doctors were misled into ordering unnecessary ferritin tests. The complaints from customers about Damon's practices were confirmation the scheme had worked.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The closer question is the degree of precision the government must reach in showing intended loss. It is true that the CERs set forth best-case scenarios which assumed all doctors would order the bundled test without culling out the ferritin test. If the CERs stood alone, defendant would have a better argument. But they are supplemented by the fact that Damon made it extremely difficult for doctors to cull out the ferritin and order the LabScan without a ferritin test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the conspirators tried to hide from doctors the fact that there was a significant cost to Medicare associated with the bundling. The conspirators were maximizing the probability that all doctors would accept the bundling, without culling and without protest. The fact that the conspirators were not entirely successful in fooling all doctors does not lessen their intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have noted before that intended loss does not have to be determined with precision; the court needs only to make a reasonable estimate in light of the available information. <i>United States v. Blastos,</i> 258 F.3d 25, 30 (1st Cir.2001). There was good evidence of intent and some \"prospect of success\" for the fraud to reap over five million dollars, and that is all that the case law requires. <i>United States v. Orlando-Figueroa,</i> 229 F.3d 33, 48 (1st Cir.2000). The best-case CER projection was a loss to Medicare over the charged five-year life of the conspiracy of $5,800,230. It was reasonable for the district court to estimate that the intended loss exceeded five million dollars, even allowing for the one to two percent normal order rate for ferritin tests. The government met its burden and Thurston offered little in rebuttal except his protestations of innocence. There was no clear error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Government's Appeal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given an intended loss of five million dollars, Thurston's crime led to the statutory maximum sentence of five years. The district court departed downward from the Guidelines range by sixteen levels, however, sentencing Thurston to three months' imprisonment to be followed by twenty-four months of supervised release. The court imposed no fine and recommended that the term of imprisonment be served in a halfway house.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Standard of Review: The PROTECT Act</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 30, 2003, section 401 of the PROTECT Act became effective.

United States,</i> 518 U.S. 81, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996), the courts of appeals were not to review a departure decision de novo, but were to ask whether the sentencing court abused its discretion in granting the departure. <i>Id.</i> at 91, 96-100, 116 S.Ct. 2035. In appeals from sentencing departures, we had, before the PROTECT Act, engaged in a three-part review: \"(1) we determine[d] whether the stated ground for departure [was] theoretically permissible under the guidelines; (2) if so, we examine[d] the record to assess whether there [was] adequate factual support; and (3) we determine[d] the appropriateness of the degree of departure.\" <i>United States v. Bogdan,</i> 302 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir.2002). Whether the stated ground for departure was theoretically permissible &#8212; the first part &#8212; was a question of law reviewed de novo. <i>United States v. Bradstreet,</i> 207 F.3d 76, 81 (1st Cir.2000); <i>see also United States v. Diaz,</i> 285 F.3d 92, 97-98 (1st Cir.2002). Under <i>Koon,</i> our review under the remaining two parts was for abuse of discretion only. <i>See Koon,</i> 518 U.S. at 96-100, 116 S.Ct. 2035; <i>United States v. Lujan,</i> 324 F.3d 27, 31 n. 5 (1st Cir.2003); <i>United States v. Martin,</i> 221 F.3d 52, 55 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the PROTECT Act, the statute requires de novo review not merely of the ultimate decision to depart, but also of \"the district court's application of the guidelines to the facts.\" &#167; 3742(e). If this court agrees that the decision to depart was justified under the guidelines, however, the <i>extent</i> of the departure granted by the district court is reviewed deferentially, just as it was prior to the PROTECT Act. <i>Id.</i>; <i>United States v. Frazier,</i> 340 F.3d 5, 14 n. 4 (1st Cir.2003); <i>see also United States v. Mallon,</i> 345 F.3d 943, 946 (7th Cir.2003); <i>United States v.

He makes two statutory intent arguments: (1) that the internal structure of the statute means it should not be applied to cases already pending on appeal; and (2) that the presumption against retroactivity should apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Thurston argues that Congress meant application of the de novo review provisions in the PROTECT Act to be deferred until appeals arise from sentences entered after the Act became effective. This is evident, Thurston says, since the Act imposed a new requirement for the district judge to give a <i>written</i> statement of reasons. From this, Thurston argues, all provisions of the Act were meant to apply only to post-Act sentencing. The argument is plausible, but we are unpersuaded. Even before the PROTECT Act, a trial court was required to give some reasons, though not necessarily in writing, for a downward departure. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(c)(pre-PROTECT Act version); <i>United States v. Sclamo,</i> 997 F.2d 970, 973 (1st Cir.1993) (discussing discouraged ground for departure); <i>United States v. DeMasi,</i> 40 F.3d 1306, 1324 (1st Cir.1994) (same). A requirement that this statement of reasons be written, rather than oral, has no particular connection to the appellate standard of review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the Act does not expressly say that its de novo review provision applies to pending appeals, it does give an effective date of April 30, 2003. The effective date of a statute does not by itself establish that it has any application to conduct that occurred at an earlier date. <i>See INS v. St. Cyr,</i> 533 U.S. 289, 317, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001) (quoting <i>Landgraf v. USI Film Prods.,</i> 511 U.S. 244, 257, 114 S.Ct. 1483, 128 L.Ed.2d 229 (1994)). Still, we agree with the Eighth Circuit that the new statute applies to appeals pending as of the effective date of the statute. <i>See United States v. Aguilar-Lopez,</i> 329 F.3d 960, 962-63 (8th Cir.2003). Subject to constitutionally based retroactivity concerns, it is certainly within Congress's power to change a standard of review. <i>See, e.g., Hines v. Sec'y of Dep't of Health &amp; Human Servs.,</i> 940 F.2d 1518, 1523 (Fed.Cir.1991); <i>Consumers Union of U.S. v. FTC,</i> 801 F.2d 417 (D.C.Cir.1986); <i>cf. Bierce v. Waterhouse,</i> 219 U.S. 320, 336-37, 31 S.Ct. 241, 55 L.Ed. 237 (1911). Much of the conduct regulated by this part of the PROTECT Act is that of the courts of appeals (and indirectly, the district courts now under closer scrutiny), and that involves conduct dating from April 30, 2003 forward.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston's fall-back argument is that applying a changed standard of review to a case already on appeal would have an impermissible effect on him under the Supreme Court's retroactivity jurisprudence. <i>See Landgraf,</i> 511 U.S. at 264, 114 S.Ct. 1483. Not so. The change of a standard of appellate review is one in procedure for the courts; procedural changes that do not affect substantial rights are not usually considered impermissibly retroactive. This legislation is little different than the Supreme Court's changing the standard of review by directing the courts of appeals to decide ultimate Fourth Amendment questions de novo. <i>Cf. Ornelas v. United States,</i> 517 U.S. 690, 697, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996). The PROTECT Act's alteration of the appellate standard of review upsets no legitimate reliance interest by a defendant; it could not have induced alteration of the behavior that led to the crime.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> We see no unfairness to defendants in Congress's requiring a closer look by appellate courts at whether a district court committed an error in deciding that the guidelines permitted a departure. It is the substance of the sentencing rules, both in the Guidelines and in the underlying statutes, that affects defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) <i>Separation of Powers</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston makes a cursory argument that the PROTECT Act presents serious constitutional separation-of-powers questions. At the request of the Senate, the Chief Justice, expressing the views of the U.S. Judicial Conference, did advise the Senate of the Conference's opposition to portions of the bill, including alteration of the standard of review. <i>See</i> Letter from Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist to Senator Patrick Leahy (undated), <i>available at</i> http://www.nacdl.org/public.nsf/2cdd02b415ea3a64852566d6000daa79/ departures/$FILE/Rehnquist_letter.pdf. The U.S. Sentencing Commission requested that Congress not act until the Commission had the opportunity to analyze data and study the matter. <i>See</i> Letter from Judge Diana Murphy, Chair of the U.S. Sentencing Commission, et al., to Senators Orrin Hatch and Patrick Leahy (April 2, 2003), <i>available at</i> http://www.nacdl.org/public.nsf/2cdd02b415ea3a64852566d6000daa79/ departures/$FILE/$TJstcg_comm_current.pdf. But judicial opposition to legislation on policy grounds is one thing; unconstitutionality is quite another. No real theory of unconstitutionality has been presented by this appeal, and so the issue is waived. See <i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(c) <i>Scope of De Novo Review</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A different argument was advanced in the petition for rehearing concerning the scope of de novo review under the PROTECT Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> The final sentence of &#167; 3742(e) requires the court of appeals to review de novo all determinations by the district court \"under subsection (3)(A) or (3)(B),\" the texts of which are set forth above. In his petition for rehearing, Thurston, ably assisted by amicus, argues that subparagraphs (3)(B)(i) and (3)(B)(ii) apply only in cases involving \"unmentioned\" departures, <i>i.e.,</i> departures on grounds not expressly considered by the Sentencing Commission. On this theory, because good works departures are specifically authorized (albeit discouraged) by the guidelines, this court is not authorized to ask whether, in Thurston's case, such a departure</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) does not advance the objectives set forth in section 3553(a)(2); or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) is not authorized under section 3553(b)[.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&#167; 3742(e)(3)(B). Instead, the argument goes, this court is bound to accept the judgment of the Sentencing Commission that good works departures are consistent with &#167; 3553(a)(2) and (b), and accordingly must limit its review to whether a good works departure \"is not justified by the facts of the case\" under subparagraph (iii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's response to this argument is less than clear. The United States contends that \"[n]othing in [the PROTECT Act] limits consideration of the factors in &#167; 3553(a)(2) or the Commission's intentions as set out [in] &#167; 3553(b)(1)[ ] to unmentioned departures, as amicus <i>curiae</i> argues.\" That statement is true as a literal matter, but it does not answer the practical question raised by amicus: whether subparagraphs (i) and (ii) permit the courts of appeals to revisit the Commission's determination that a particular ground for departure (<i>e.g.,</i> exceptional good works) comports with those provisions. The government does not directly answer that question. It does, however, strongly oppose amicus's argument that the courts of appeals are barred from considering the purposes of sentencing, the structure and purposes of the sentencing guidelines, or similar aids in evaluating the propriety of departures in particular cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, there is less to this dispute than meets the eye. For the reasons explained below, we agree with the defense that a court of appeals, in reviewing a departure under &#167; 3742(e)(3)(B)(i) and (ii), must accept and may not look behind the Sentencing Commission's determination that a particular categorical basis for departure is permissible or impermissible. At the same time, we agree with the government that under subparagraph (iii), a court of appeals is free to weigh the purposes of sentencing, the intentions of the Commission, and any other relevant considerations in deciding whether a particular departure is \"justified by the facts of the case.\" This reading both reaffirms the authority of the Sentencing Commission and broadens appellate review of sentencing departures on grounds not considered by the Commission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the focus of an appellate court's inquiry under &#167; 3742(e)(3)(B). Although most of &#167; 3742(e) is concerned with \"the sentence\" actually imposed, <i>see</i> &#167; 3742(e) (preamble), subsection (e)(3)(B) directs the court of appeals to focus on the \"factor\" cited by the district court as the basis for granting a departure. <i>See</i> &#167; 3742(e)(3)(B) (\"the sentence departs from the applicable guideline range <i>based on a factor that</i>....\" (emphasis added)). Amicus argues, and we agree, that the initial question under &#167; 3742(e)(3)(B) is whether the district court selected a categorical basis for departure that the U.S. Sentencing Commission has considered and authorized. Because the Commission has already declared certain factors to be permissible grounds for departure, Congress could not reasonably have intended &#167; 3742(e)(3)(B) as a warrant to second-guess the Commission's policy judgments on those matters. If, on the other hand, the district court cited as its basis for departure a factor that the Commission has not expressly considered, then the court of appeals must make its own determinations under subparagraphs (3)(B)(i) and (ii). Where, as here, the departure was based on a factor considered by the Commission (<i>i.e.,</i> exceptional good works), de novo review extends only to whether the departure was \"justified by the facts of the case.\" &#167; 3742(e)(3)(B)(iii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Implicit in this conclusion is an analysis of the word \"factor\" in &#167; 3742(e)(3)(B). That term, in this context, must be read to mean a categorical basis for departure, independent of the facts of the case (for example, \"good works\" generally). The PROTECT Act inserted a new subsection (j) in &#167; 3742 that forthrightly equates the term \"factor\" with \"ground of departure.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> In addition, the sentencing guidelines themselves, before the PROTECT Act, employed the word \"factor\" to refer generally to a basis for departure. <i>See, e.g., U.S.S.G.</i> &#167; 5K2.0 (2002) (\"Grounds for Departure\"). The Supreme Court adopted the same usage in <i>Koon. See, e.g.,</i> 518 U.S. at 98, 116 S.Ct. 2035 (referring to \"whether a discouraged factor nonetheless justifies departure\"). Interpreting the term \"factor\" in &#167; 3742(e)(3)(B) to refer to a categorical basis for departure is also consistent with this court's own guidelines cases, which have frequently used the term in that way. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Mejia,</i> 309 F.3d 67, 70 (1st Cir.2002) (referring to \"factors that are either encouraged or discouraged bases for departure\"); <i>United States v. Bogdan,</i> 284 F.3d 324, 328 (1st Cir.2002) (referring to \"factors that are explicitly or implicitly proscribed by the Sentencing Guidelines as bases for departure\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, there is some support for the contrary view, inherent in the government's position, that \"factor\" refers not to the categorical basis for departure but to the district court's fact-specific justification for departing in a particular case. For example, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a), which was amended by the PROTECT Act, is entitled \"<i>Factors</i> to be considered in imposing a sentence\" (emphasis added), and it requires district courts to take account of such case-specific matters as \"the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant.\" &#167; 3553(a)(1). Nevertheless, we are persuaded that the word \"factor\" in &#167; 3742(e)(3)(B) is better understood as a shorthand for a categorical basis for departure. Congress, in enacting the PROTECT Act, plainly employed the term in that way in &#167; 3742(j), and we hold that it intended the word to have the same meaning in &#167; 3742(e)(3)(B).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is also apparent that Congress did not intend &#167; 3742(e)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) as a license for the courts of appeals to second-guess the Sentencing Commission's determinations that specific factors are permissible or impermissible. In Part K of Chapter 5 of the sentencing guidelines, the Commission has identified specific mitigating and aggravating factors that, in the Commission's view, may justify departure. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.0 (2002 ed.) (\"[T]his subpart seeks to aid the court by identifying some of the factors that the Commission has not been able to take into account fully in formulating the guidelines.... Presence of any such factor may warrant departure from the guidelines....\"). The Commission has also prohibited departures based on certain factors. <i>See, e.g.,</i> &#167; 5H1.10 (race, sex, national origin, creed, religion, and socio-economic status); &#167; 5K1.2 (defendant's refusal to assist authorities in investigating other persons); <i>see also</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.0(d) (Nov.2003 ed.) (\"Prohibited Departures\"). For appellate courts to revisit such determinations anew in every case would undermine the authority of the Sentencing Commission, reduce uniformity in sentencing, and risk \"recreat[ing] the location-based sentencing swings that Congress sought to minimize when it opted for a guideline paradigm.\" <i>United States v. Snyder,</i> 136 F.3d 65, 69 (1st Cir.1998). Prior to the PROTECT Act, the Sentencing Commission's judgments were not open to such attacks. <i>See, e.g., Koon,</i> 518 U.S. at 95-96, 116 S.Ct. 2035 (explaining that if the Commission has forbidden a particular ground of departure, \"the sentencing court <i>cannot</i> use it as a basis for departure\" (emphasis added)); <i>United States v. Rivera,</i> 994 F.2d 942, 949 (1st Cir.1993) (Breyer, J.) (even if forbidden factors are present to such an extent that the case is outside the relevant guideline's heartland, \"the sentencing court is not free to consider departing\"). There is no reason to think Congress intended to change that rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we hold that where the Commission has expressly considered and forbidden or approved (even if discouraged) a particular factor for departure, the court of appeals is bound to accept that determination and cannot revisit it under subparagraphs (i) or (ii) of &#167; 3742(e)(3)(B).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a> So in Thurston's case, because the Commission has determined that departures based on exceptional good works are authorized, we do not inquire whether such departures comport with subparagraphs (i) or (ii), and instead proceed directly to the question whether the departure \"is not justified by the facts of the case.\" &#167; 3742(e)(3)(B)(iii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a second component, which we do not accept, to the defense's interpretation of &#167; 3742(e)(3)(B). Amicus argues that in evaluating whether a departure on a particular ground is \"justified by the facts of the case\" under subparagraph (iii), this court may not refer to the underlying purposes of sentencing, the Commission's intent in its guidelines and policy statements, or other extra-record considerations. The reason, amicus says, is the same: it is the province of the Commission to weigh such considerations, and Congress could not have intended the court of appeals to re-weigh those issues when reviewing a specific sentencing departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p131\">\n      <span class=\"num\">131</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject this argument for several reasons. First, the PROTECT Act asks whether the departure is \"justified\" by the facts of the case. That calls for an evaluative judgment, not a mechanical exercise. <i>See</i> Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary 1228 (1993) (\"justify\" means \"to prove or show to be just, desirable, warranted, or useful\"). Nothing in the statute purports to constrain the sources that the reviewing court may consider. Second, we see no serious risk that the Commission's legitimacy or authority will be undermined if a court of appeals refers to the purposes of sentencing, the goals of the guidelines, or other policy considerations in determining whether, on the facts before the court, a particular defendant fits within a particular categorical \"factor.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a> Third, those considerations were a regular part of the test that Congress required of the courts of appeals under &#167; 3742(e)(3) even prior to the PROTECT Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, the district court not only may but must consider the purposes of sentencing and the Commission's relevant guidelines and policy statements when it imposes a sentence. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a); <i>see also id.</i> &#167; 3553(b) (\"In the absence of an applicable sentencing guideline, the court shall impose an appropriate sentence, having due regard for the purposes [of sentencing] set forth in subsection (a)(2).\"). The PROTECT Act requires this court to apply de novo review under &#167; 3742(e)(3)(B)(iii), and it would be anomalous for Congress to have required plenary review but restricted the sources of law or fact that may inform that review. Adopting amicus's interpretation would produce the counterintuitive conclusion that Congress, in expanding appellate review of departures in the PROTECT Act, simultaneously prevented the courts of appeals in some cases from reviewing aspects of the district court's reasoning. Congress could not have intended such a result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p133\">\n      <span class=\"num\">133</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For similar reasons, we reject the government's suggestion that we adopt bright-line rules against the consideration of certain kinds of information in our exercise of de novo review under subparagraph (3)(B)(iii). In particular, the government urges that we cannot consult district court opinions (at least to the extent not tested on appeal) or databases of sentencing decisions. Nothing in the PROTECT Act precludes us from considering such sources. To be certain, experience gained under the Act with the passage of time may show that particular kinds of information have greater or lesser value. Databases of sentencing outcomes, for example, may or may not prove pertinent, depending on their scope and the types of information they report. But we decline to adopt any mechanical rule restricting the information that the court may consider under &#167; 3742(e)(3)(B)(iii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p134\">\n      <span class=\"num\">134</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(d) <i>Deferential Review After the PROTECT Act</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also reject a final argument by the defense, said to be drawn from <i>Ornelas v. United States,</i> 517 U.S. 690, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996), that de novo review involves deference not only to the district court's determinations of historical fact, but also to its ultimate conclusions &#8212; for example, whether a defendant's good works are \"exceptional.\" It is true that in sentencing cases, \"appellate review must occur with full awareness of, and respect for, the trier's superior `feel' for the case.\" <i>United States v. Diaz-Villafane,</i> 874 F.2d 43, 49-50 (1st Cir.1989). We do agree that this court must defer to a sentencing court's findings of historical fact, even after the PROTECT Act. The Act did not alter the provision in &#167; 3742(e) that the district court's findings of fact must be accepted unless clearly erroneous. <i>See</i> &#167; 3742(e). Other circuits agree with this interpretation of the Act. <i>Mallon,</i> 345 F.3d at 946; <i>Jones,</i> 332 F.3d at 1300 n. 9. Indeed, the government concedes this point. To the extent amicus suggests that the court of appeals should defer to the district court's application of the departure guidelines to the facts, however, its argument is refuted by the plain text of &#167; 3742(e). After the PROTECT Act, that kind of deference is not ours to give.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>The Downward Departures</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p136\">\n      <span class=\"num\">136</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that each of the stated grounds for downward departure was in error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a> First, it contends that the district court was forbidden to depart downward based on a disparity between Thurston's sentence and the sentence of the company president, a cooperating co-conspirator who pled guilty. Second, it argues that departures for good works are discouraged, and that the facts do not justify a finding that Thurston's good works are so exceptional as to warrant such a departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) <i>Disparity With Co-Defendant</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p138\">\n      <span class=\"num\">138</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court felt there was an unfair disparity between a five-year sentence of imprisonment for Thurston and the three-year probation sentence for co-conspirator Isola. It viewed Isola as \"the architect, at least the prime architect of this conspiracy.\" Apparently the district court felt that Isola, Thurston's superior, was the guiltier of the two, and that this fact overshadowed other differences between their cases. Isola pled nolo contendere to willful blindness about the apolipoprotein conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p139\">\n      <span class=\"num\">139</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the law of this circuit makes clear, basing the departure on grounds of disparity in sentence alone between Thurston and Isola was beyond the district court's authority. <i>United States v. Wogan,</i> 938 F.2d 1446, 1448 (1st Cir.1991); <i>see also United States v. Romolo,</i> 937 F.2d 20, 25 n. 5 (1st Cir.1991). Sidestepping circuit precedent, the district court referred to a statute that requires a sentencing court to consider not only the Commission's Sentencing Guidelines and policy statements, but also \"the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a)(6). This provision was unchanged by the PROTECT Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p140\">\n      <span class=\"num\">140</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet the same statute also requires that the court \"shall impose a sentence of the kind, and within the range [of the pertinent Guidelines], unless the court finds that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(b)(1). That is why, since as early as 1991, this court has interpreted the statute to preclude sentencing judges from departing downward based on \"a perceived need to equalize sentencing outcomes for similarly situated co-defendants, without more.\" <i>Wogan,</i> 938 F.2d at 1448 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p141\">\n      <span class=\"num\">141</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"more\" that is needed refers to circumstances not adequately considered by the Commission, and none have been shown here with regard to disparity. In the pre-guidelines era, the district court's attempt to avoid perceived unfairness would have had greater weight. The guidelines bind us and they bind the district court. The downward departure based on disparity in sentences among co-defendants was impermissible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p142\">\n      <span class=\"num\">142</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) <i>Good Works</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p143\">\n      <span class=\"num\">143</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second ground, based on Thurston's good works, poses the most difficult issue in the case. We have found disparity alone an impermissible ground; it is possible the trial court would not have granted so extensive a departure based on good works alone. It may also be that if the court had granted a modest departure on the second ground, the government would not have appealed. But the trial court did not differentiate and the government on appeal argues that any departure at all based on good works (like the departure for disparity) was contrary to law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p144\">\n      <span class=\"num\">144</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentencing guidelines discourage downward departures from the normal sentencing range based on good works &#8212; that is, civic, charitable, or public service. U.S.S.G. &#167; 5H1.11. Such departures are permitted only when the good works are \"exceptional.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a> <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. ch. 5, pt. H, introductory cmt. (departures based on discouraged factors should occur only \"in exceptional cases\"); <i>Koon,</i> 518 U.S. at 95, 116 S.Ct. 2035; <i>United States v. Pereira,</i> 272 F.3d 76, 80 (1st Cir.2001). The district court based its conclusion that Thurston's good works were exceptional on Thurston's \"record of charitable work and community service[, which is] unique, extensive and extraordinary.\" The court continued, \"I think the record should reflect that in over fourteen years of sentencing defendants, it's my judgment that no one had a more extraordinary devotion to charitable work, community service, and especially ... to his church.\" Thurston is a member of a church, tithes ten percent of his income, and devotes hours every week to unpaid service with the church in a variety of positions. Letters from his fellow congregants characterize him as a man of principle and impeccable character<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a> &#8212; characterizations undermined, of course, by the jury's finding of guilt. In any event, it is Thurston's record of good works, objectively measured, and not his good character that is at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p145\">\n      <span class=\"num\">145</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to his church activities, Thurston has taken family members and others into his home and has been helpful to his neighbors. For example, the parents of a woman undergoing rehabilitation at a local medical center stayed at Thurston's home for several weeks. On another occasion, Thurston and his family laid sod for an infirm neighbor. Save for his crime, Thurston appears to have lived a creditworthy life.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p146\">\n      <span class=\"num\">146</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue, however, is not whether Thurston engaged in \"good works\" within the meaning of &#167; 5H1.11 &#8212; plainly he did &#8212; but whether those works were exceptional enough to overcome the judgment of the Sentencing Commission that a record of good works is a discouraged basis for departure &#8212; that is, good works are \"not ordinarily relevant\" to the decision whether to depart from the guidelines. &#167; 5H1.11. We hold that a departure for good works was not justified on the facts of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p147\">\n      <span class=\"num\">147</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This circuit, even before the PROTECT Act, reversed departures based on discouraged factors where the record did not indicate that the defendant's circumstances were genuinely exceptional. For example, in <i>United States v. Bogdan,</i> 284 F.3d 324 (1st Cir.2002), the defendant was a caring and generous father who had gone out of his way to support his ex-wife and who had expressed deep remorse for his crime. This court concluded that Bogdan's case was not so exceptional as to qualify for a downward departure based on either family responsibilities or acceptance of responsibility, both of which are discouraged factors. <i>See id.</i> at 329-30. When, on remand, the district court again granted a downward departure because it thought Bogdan's sentence \"unconscionable,\" this court again reversed. <i>See United States v. Bogdan,</i> 302 F.3d 12, 15, 16-17 (1st Cir.2002). The <i>Bogdan</i> cases illustrate that the \"exceptional case\" hurdle for discouraged departures is a very high one. <i>See also Pereira,</i> 272 F.3d at 82-83 (family responsibilities departure, a discouraged factor, requires a showing of something akin to irreplaceability to qualify as exceptional); <i>United States v. Craven,</i> 239 F.3d 91, 100 (1st Cir.2001) (departure on discouraged ground of extraordinary presentence rehabilitation requires, at a minimum, a showing of a fundamental change in attitude).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p148\">\n      <span class=\"num\">148</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case law under &#167; 5H1.11 offers little guidance as to when a defendant's good works may be characterized as exceptional. What is clear, however, is that the problem is not merely one of quantity. The context of the defendant's good works is important. Here, Thurston's position as a prominent corporate executive weighs in our analysis. It is hardly surprising that a corporate executive like Thurston is better situated to make large financial contributions than someone for whom the expenses of day-to-day life are more pressing; indeed, business leaders are often expected, by virtue of their positions, to engage in civic and charitable activities. Those who donate large sums because they can should not gain an advantage over those who do not make such donations because they cannot. <i>See United States v. Morken,</i> 133 F.3d 628, 629-30 (8th Cir.1998) (reversing a downward departure because the defendant's good works were not exceptional in light of his income and preeminence in a small town); <i>United States v. Kohlbach,</i> 38 F.3d 832, 838-39 (6th Cir.1994) (vacating a good works departure because \"it is <i>usual</i> and <i>ordinary,</i> in the prosecution of similar white collar crimes involving high-ranking corporate executives ... to find that a defendant was involved as a leader in community charities, civic organizations, and church efforts\" (emphasis in original)); <i>United States v. McHan,</i> 920 F.2d 244, 248 (4th Cir.1990) (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p149\">\n      <span class=\"num\">149</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston's religion plays no role in our analysis of whether his good works are exceptional. It is a neutral fact. <i>Cf.</i> &#167; 5H1.10 (religion is \"not relevant in the determination of a sentence\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p150\">\n      <span class=\"num\">150</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The purposes of the sentencing guidelines, by contrast, are highly relevant. One of the goals of the entire guidelines regime was to minimize discrepancies in the treatment of \"white collar\" and \"blue collar\" crimes. Congress and the Sentencing Commission were clear that under the pre-guidelines regime, sentences for white collar crimes were too lenient.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a> The Commission intended its guidelines and policy statements to \"equalize punishments for `white collar' and `blue collar' crime.\" <i>United States v. Rivera,</i> 994 F.2d 942, 955 (1st Cir.1993) (Breyer, J.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p151\">\n      <span class=\"num\">151</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against that background, the nature of Thurston's offense mitigates against concluding that his good works are \"exceptional.\" Health care fraud is a serious crime and the federal interest in combating it is powerful. The federal government spent approximately $249 billion on Medicare in 2002. One group has estimated that about three percent of the $1.4 trillion the country spent on health care in 2001 was lost to fraud.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a> <i>See</i> \"A Sick Business,\" <i>The Economist,</i> June 28, 2003, at 64 (citing data from National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association); <i>see also</i> National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association, <i>Health Care Fraud,</i> at 2, <i>available at</i> http://www.nhcaa.org/pdf/all_about_hcf.pdf (n.d.). Health care fraud affects the financial integrity of programs meant to aid tens of millions of people in need of health care. Every dollar lost to fraud is a dollar that could have provided medical care to the elderly or the disabled. Almost by definition, Medicare fraud is white collar fraud, most often committed by educated people with responsible jobs. Thurston's executive position at Damon, which gave him the resources to undertake many of his charitable works, also enabled him to perform the crime. That fact seriously undercuts Thurston's claim that his good works are \"exceptional\" in context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p152\">\n      <span class=\"num\">152</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Were it not for the statutory maximum, Thurston would have been sentenced to imprisonment for more than five years under the guidelines. Thurston's good works are admirable, but considered in context, they are not so exceptional as to justify reducing the sentence for the grave crime that he committed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p153\">\n      <span class=\"num\">153</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The downward departure for good works is reversed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Upward Departure</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p154\">\n      <span class=\"num\">154</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's argument that Thurston's conduct warranted an upward adjustment for obstruction of justice based on perjury at trial need not be resolved, given our disposition of the other issues. The statute caps his period of incarceration at sixty months. It is noteworthy, though, that Thurston's testimony on key matters of fact was contradicted by multiple witnesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. <i>Fine</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p155\">\n      <span class=\"num\">155</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that the sentencing judge erred by failing to impose a fine on Thurston in accordance with the guidelines. Thurston argued, and the district court accepted, that he should not receive a fine because that would create an unacceptable disparity between his sentence and that of co-defendant Isola. Sentence disparity is an unacceptable basis for refusing to impose a fine and is plain error for the reasons discussed earlier.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p156\">\n      <span class=\"num\">156</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston contends that the government has forfeited its argument that a fine must be imposed by failing to object after the judge ruled. The government earlier took the position that a fine must be imposed and also argued that the court could not refuse to impose a fine on the basis of disparity &#8212; the only argument Thurston presented. In these circumstances, the issue was not forfeited. <i>See Gallant,</i> 306 F.3d at 1187-88 (holding that a sentencing issue was not forfeited as a result of counsel's failure to object after the court's ruling); <i>cf. United States v. Meserve,</i> 271 F.3d 314, 325 (1st Cir.2001) (motion to strike unnecessary to preserve evidentiary issue where party objected prior to trial court's ruling). Even were this an instance of forfeiture, the district court committed plain error in its rationale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p157\">\n      <span class=\"num\">157</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before this court, Thurston attempts to defend the decision not to impose a fine on the basis that the statutory definition of his crime, which provides that a fine may be assigned, trumps the guidelines, which provide that a fine must be assigned barring special circumstances. The crime of which Thurston was convicted, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371, provides for a prison term, a fine, or both. By contrast, U.S.S.G. &#167; 5E1.2(a) says, \"The court shall impose a fine <i>in all cases,</i> except where the defendant establishes that he is unable to pay and is not likely to become able to pay any fine.\" (emphasis added). The defendant did not establish, or even seek to establish, inability to pay. The sentencing judge made no finding, implicit or explicit, that Thurston could not pay. The PSR estimated that Thurston had a net worth of over $1.5 million, and the minimum fine under the guidelines was $12,500.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p158\">\n      <span class=\"num\">158</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the sentence fixed by U.S.S.G. &#167; 5E1.2(a) is within the range contemplated by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371, the guideline is not trumped by the statute. <i>See United States v. Page,</i> 84 F.3d 38, 43 (1st Cir.1996) (\"There is no reason why the Guidelines may not make their own classifications within the statutes, and hence definitions which the courts must observe, so long as these are not internally inconsistent or in violation of the Constitution or a federal statute.\"). Here, there is no inconsistency and the district court was required to impose a fine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p159\">\n      <span class=\"num\">159</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston's conviction is <i>affirmed.</i> Thurston's sentence is <i>vacated</i>; the downward departure based on good works and purported disparity is <i>reversed</i>; and the order that no fine be imposed is <i>reversed.</i> The case is <i>remanded</i> for imposition of the statutory maximum sentence of sixty months in prison and for imposition of an appropriate fine. <i>So ordered.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The original panel opinion in this case issued on August 4, 2003.

The Federal Defender Office and District of Massachusetts Criminal Justice Act Board filed an amicus brief in support of Thurston's petition, arguing that the panel had misconstrued the de novo review provisions contained in &#167; 401 of the Prosecutorial Remedies and Tools Against the Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003 (PROTECT Act), Pub.L.

Representative Tom Feeney, the sponsor of the amendment that became &#167; 401, was particularly interested in limiting such departures. Feeney stated that under the Supreme Court's decision in Koon, district judges were permitted to depart downward based on \"any factor not explicitly disapproved by the sentencing commission.... So judges can make up exceptions as they go along.\" 149 Cong. Rec. H2422-23 (daily ed. March 27, 2003) (statement of Rep. Feeney). At a different point, Rep. Feeney referred to a need to prevent \"ad hoc departures based on vague grounds, such as `general mitigating circumstances.'\"<i>Id.</i> at H2423.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">These statements certainly illuminate one of Congress's purposes in the PROTECT Act, but they do not meaningfully assist our interpretation of &#167; 3742(e)(3)(B). Rep. Feeney's concerns about unmentioned departures are consistent with the overarching purpose of the PROTECT Act to reduce the incidence of downward departures generally. Moreover, Congress apparently rejected Rep. Feeney's initial proposal to eliminate <i>all</i> departures on unmentioned grounds. <i>See id.</i> at 2420-21. And none of the parties has cited, and we have not discovered, any legislative history addressing the specific issue here: whether Congress intended the courts of appeals to engage in de novo review under subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of &#167; 3742(e)(3)(B) even where the ground for departure selected by the district court has been expressly approved by the Sentencing Commission.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn21\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21_ref\">21</a>\n        <p> This interpretation is also consistent with &#167; 3742(f), another provision amended by the PROTECT Act. That section establishes the circumstances under which the court of appeals may remand a case for re-sentencing. Subparagraph (2) addresses remands in departure cases. In language obviously intended to mirror the substance of &#167; 3742(e)(3), it permits the court of appeals to vacate a departure and remand if \"the district court failed to provide the required statement of reasons in the order of judgment and commitment,<i>or the departure is based on an impermissible factor,</i> or is to an unreasonable degree....\" &#167; 3742(f)(2) (emphasis added).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn22\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22_ref\">22</a>\n        <p> This conclusion is slightly different from amicus's position that subparagraphs (i) and (ii) simply \"do not apply\" to mentioned departures. There is no basis in the statute to hold those subparagraphs<i>inapplicable</i> to certain types of departures. Properly framed, the question is whether a ground for departure endorsed by the Commission can ever fail the tests set forth in &#167; 3742(e)(3)(B)(i) and (ii). We answer that question in the negative.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn23\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23_ref\">23</a>\n        <p> Hypothetically, the Commission's statutory authority could be undercut if an appellate court were to construe an approved basis for departure so narrowly that, as a practical matter, no set of facts could ever qualify. But that circumstance is extremely unlikely and, in any event, is not presented here</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn24\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24_ref\">24</a>\n        <p> Before the PROTECT Act, &#167; 3742(e)(3) simply required the court of appeals to determine whether the sentence imposed by the district court was \"unreasonable\" in light of,<i>inter alia,</i> \"the factors to be considered in imposing a sentence.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742(e)(3) (2000). Those factors, which appear in &#167; 3553(a), include the purposes of sentencing. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Smith,</i> 14 F.3d 662, 666 (1st Cir.1994) (referring to the \"sentencing system's purposes\" in rejecting a downward departure).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn25\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25_ref\">25</a>\n        <p> The court stated:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">[I]n granting the motion for downward departure, I'm basing it on two grounds.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">First, the downward departure is justified because of the defendant Thurston's record of charitable work and community service[, which] is unique, extensive and extraordinary. I think the record should reflect that in over fourteen years of sentencing defendants, it's my judgment that no one had a more extraordinary devotion to charitable work, community service, and especially his dedication to his church.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">And the second ground is that which is set out in the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines Manual under Chapter 1, Part A, Section 3, which is entitled... \"The Basic Approach, paren, policy statement, closed paren,\" setting forth the rationale of the guidelines, it's cited here that Congress sought reasonable uniformity in sentencing by narrowing the wide disparity in sentences imposed for similar criminal offenses committed by similar offenders.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Congress sought proportionality in sentencing through a system that imposes appropriately different sentences for criminal conduct of differing severity.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">We have a situation here where coconspirator Isola, the president of Damon and the architect, at least the prime architect of this conspiracy, received a sentence of three years' probation, and it is, in my judgment, a violation of the fundamental purpose of the Sentencing Commission Guidelines to impose a sentence which is not at least somewhat similar to that incurred by a coconspirator who was more involved in the conspiracy t[h]an this defendant.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn26\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26_ref\">26</a>\n        <p> Good works may also be considered in setting a sentence within the guidelines range or in setting certain conditions.

When doctors or patients (instead of insurers) paid for the bundled LabScan, Damon provided the ferritin test for free, leading doctors to believe there was no extra charge for this test. Doctors were not told that, when Medicare paid for the bundled LabScan, Medicare was charged extra for the ferritin test. Indeed, both a letter and marketing materials indicated the added ferritin test was \"free\"; that is, that there was no charge beyond the standard LabScan charge. Those unnecessary ferritin tests were not free to Medicare. Damon charged Medicare roughly $21 per ferritin test on top of the approximately $24 charged for the LabScan. Nor were doctors told that the ferritin test could be ordered separately; the test requisition form did not offer that option. The physicians, then, were induced to order and to certify as medically necessary a large number of ferritin tests that were not medically necessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's theory was that Damon did this to offset Medicare's 1988 reduction in reimbursement rates of sixteen percent, which was projected to cause Damon an estimated annual loss of $800,000 in revenues. In just one of Thurston's labs, the orders for ferritin tests were expected to increase from approximately three hundred per month to roughly ten thousand per month. Thurston testified that he was innocent, and that he neither had knowledge of nor responsibility for key components of the conspiracy. The jury disagreed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the sentencing guidelines called for a sentence of sixty-three to seventy-eight months, the district court sentenced Thurston to only three months' imprisonment. It did so by granting a downward departure to \"correct\" a perceived disparity between a five-year sentence of imprisonment for Thurston and the sentence of three years' probation given to the company president, Joseph Isola, who had pled nolo contendere and assisted the government. Its second ground for departure was its sense that the good works Thurston did for his church and community were extraordinary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This sentence outraged the prosecutors, who appealed, arguing that the district court lacked the power to depart downward for any of the reasons it gave, and that, even if a departure were appropriate, the extent of the departure was excessive. The government also appeals the district court's failure to impose a fine, on the basis that the sentencing guidelines, if not the statute, mandated a fine. Finally, the prosecution argues that if some departure for good works was warranted, the district court was required to address an issue it avoided: the government's request for an upward departure on the ground that Thurston had obstructed justice by committing perjury on the witness stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston also appeals, arguing that the conviction must be vacated because the prosecution was barred by the statute of limitations, because he was entitled to a jury instruction and to acquittal on the basis that he reasonably interpreted the law to mean he could rely on the physicians' certifications of medical necessity, and because of other errors. In addition, Thurston argues that his sentence was too high because his base offense level calculation depended on an amount of loss, either actual or intended, that was unproven and excessive. Thurston also defends the downward departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several important issues are raised by these appeals. The government's appeal requires us to address the effect of the new Prosecutorial Remedies and Tools Against the Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003 (PROTECT Act), Pub.L. No. 108-21, 117 Stat. 650,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> on the standard that the courts of appeals use to review downward departure decisions by district judges in sentencing, as well as the availability of a downward departure for a record of good works under U.S.S.G. &#167; 5H1.11. Thurston's appeal invites, <i>inter alia,</i> clarification of the defense doctrine concerning a defendant's reasonable interpretation of the law; the issue of when a statute of limitations defense must be raised; the ramifications of a trial judge's failure to respond to jury instructions proposed by counsel; the evidence needed to show an intended loss; and the question whether fines are mandatory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end we sustain the conviction but find that the sentence was in error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. FACTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We state the facts as the jury could reasonably have found them, including a fair description of the defense evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Medicare provides certain medical services and care, including clinical laboratory testing services, to persons aged sixty-five and older and to persons with disabilities. At the time of the conspiracy, Medicare was administered by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. HCFA in turn contracted with private insurance companies (\"carriers\" and \"intermediaries\") to handle claims for reimbursement to Medicare program beneficiaries. By law, Medicare only reimburses clinical laboratory services if those services were medically necessary for the treatment or diagnosis of a beneficiary's illness or injury. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395y(a)(1)(A) (2000); <i>see also</i> 42 C.F.R. &#167; 424.10(a) (1988). Medicare did not generally reimburse screening tests. Medicare reimbursed one-hundred percent of the cost of necessary clinical blood tests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Damon was, at the time, a Massachusetts corporation that provided clinical laboratory testing services to physicians, hospitals, health maintenance organizations, and their patients nationwide. Approximately thirty percent of Damon's revenues were from Medicare. Damon owned and operated a national system of clinical laboratories, and Damon was an approved Medicare provider. When Damon billed the Medicare program, it submitted to the carriers a HCFA 1500 form saying that it certified the lab tests were medically necessary. Physicians did not see those bills.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston served as Regional Vice President of Damon from 1987 to 1990, and was responsible during all or part of this time for Damon's regional laboratories in Newbury Park, California; Phoenix; Chicago; and San Francisco. His office was at the Newbury Park lab; he traveled to the other labs and was in regular phone contact. Thurston was promoted to Senior Vice President of Operations in 1990. Thereafter, he relocated to the company headquarters in Needham, Massachusetts and supervised only the San Francisco lab. Another company purchased Damon in August 1993; Thurston later switched employers and moved to Utah.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Theories of Prosecution and Defense</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's theory was that the defendants tricked doctors into ordering medically unnecessary tests, for which Medicare paid. Damon added little-used tests to more popular panels of tests; it then tricked doctors by concealing that the panels could be ordered without the added tests and that Medicare was being charged for the tests. To conceal from doctors that Medicare was being charged, and to encourage doctors to order ferritin tests regardless of medical necessity, the defendants charged doctors and patients little or no extra fee for the added tests; provided literature saying that ferritin was provided free; otherwise failed to disclose to doctors the cost to Medicare of the expanded LabScan; and made it difficult to order the bundled test without ferritin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defense theories were that there was no conspiracy and, if there were, that Thurston was not a knowing participant. The defense contended that Damon complied with existing Medicare regulations, which neither prohibited bundling nor imposed a requirement on the lab to disregard a physician's certification that tests were medically necessary. It further argued that even if Thurston's interpretation of the regulations was incorrect, it was objectively reasonable, and so Thurston lacked the required criminal intent. Thurston's defense was also that any fraud was carried out by his subordinates, without his knowledge. He testified that he did not instruct the labs to add ferritin; did not authorize or condone any decision to forego a fee increase for doctors or private-pay patients on the expanded LabScan; did not instruct subordinates to conceal that doctors could order a LabScan without ferritin; and had nothing to do with requisition forms or particular pieces of marketing literature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Evidence of Conspiracy to Defraud</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Addition of Ferritin</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late 1987, HCFA announced that effective April 1, 1988, Medicare would reduce by almost sixteen percent the fees paid to laboratories, including Damon, for providing clinical laboratory services to beneficiaries. If Damon maintained its existing practices and fee structure, then Damon would lose $800,000 in revenues during the first year alone, as Thurston knew. Of that amount, more than $500,000 of the annual losses would occur at Thurston's four regional laboratories.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There were corporate discussions, which included Thurston, about how to offset this loss. As a result, Damon added its ferritin test to the LabScan, a panel of more than a dozen blood chemistry tests performed by a single machine on one blood sample. The ferritin test was performed on separate equipment. Damon bundled ferritin with the LabScan from 1988 to at least mid 1993. The LabScan had been requested on at least thirty-five to forty percent of the orders submitted to Thurston's regional laboratories. By contrast, doctors rarely ordered the ferritin test. The general manager of one of the laboratories Thurston oversaw estimated that only one to two percent of the orders for blood tests included a request for a ferritin test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in the medical literature at the time showed ferritin was necessary for all persons receiving LabScans. Indeed, it was not. A family practitioner testified that he needed ferritin less than ten percent of the time it was included as part of the LabScan. Similarly, an internist testified that he needed the ferritin test for very few of his Medicare patients.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plan to add ferritin to the LabScan was discussed at a general managers meeting in January 1988 and at a mid-year financial meeting for the western region in March 1988. Thurston attended both meetings. In late March, Thurston personally approved the addition of ferritin to the LabScans offered by the Newbury Park, San Francisco, and Phoenix labs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Thurston initially acquiesced when the Phoenix lab sought permission not to add ferritin; in August 1988, however, after Thurston saw the financial results from the addition of ferritin at his other labs, Thurston ordered the Phoenix lab to add the test to the LabScan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston presented evidence that the decision to add ferritin was made at a lower level for legitimate reasons. Thurston and Isola testified that at the general managers meeting in early 1988, management decided to allow individual laboratories to determine whether to add ferritin to the LabScan. There was also testimony that Damon's sales force made requests to the sales managers and general managers of individual labs to add ferritin to the LabScan, on the grounds that the new test would make the panel more competitive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Differential Charging for Ferritin Test</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) <i>Thurston's Knowledge of Price Differential</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Medicare provided one reimbursement for the ferritin test and a separate reimbursement for the LabScan panel. In 1988, for example, Medicare paid $24.05 for a LabScan and $20.86 for a ferritin test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston's labs submitted to him capital expenditure requests (CERs) to help with the decision whether to bundle the tests. CERs were financial projections comparing the additional revenues (from Medicare reimbursements) and costs (partly from the purchase of new equipment) that would result from the addition of ferritin to the LabScan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> These CERs assumed there would be no increase in the charge to doctors and patients for a LabScan with ferritin. Thurston discussed and then signed the CERs. They projected losses of revenue from doctors and patients (who would receive free ferritin tests) and massive increases in revenue from Medicare reimbursements. One lab, for example, projected that the number of ferritin tests performed for Medicare beneficiaries would grow from 25 per month to 1,946 per month &#8212; increasing revenues by $10,308 per month. Overall, Thurston's labs projected that they would increase their Medicare reimbursements by approximately $1.16 million per year by adding ferritin to the LabScan; if multiplied by five years, this increase would be $5.8 million. The capital expenditure requests were best-case projections, assuming that every doctor who would otherwise have ordered a LabScan without ferritin would now order a LabScan with ferritin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Damon sought reimbursement (at different rates) for ferritin tests from Medicare, CHAMPUS,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> and other insurers, but provided them for free to doctors and patients. Thurston said he was unaware doctors were not being charged. But Thurston approved the decision by a number of his labs to adopt this policy of differential pricing depending on the client, and the CERs assumed no price increase for doctors and patients. Thurston instructed a subordinate to add ferritin at no charge to doctors; Thurston was present at a meeting in which another executive announced the no-charge policy; and Thurston received a memo saying that there was no price increase for doctors at a lab he oversaw. Witnesses testified that physicians are highly price-sensitive about charges for lab work and might object to the automatic inclusion of ferritin unless the test were provided for free. At least initially, many or all of Thurston's labs increased the charge to private insurance companies for a LabScan based on the addition of ferritin. However, any price increase for private insurers on the expanded LabScan was much smaller than the cost increase to Medicare.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston presented evidence that two of his labs did increase the price for physicians; that this price increase provoked complaints by doctors; that he was informed of these complaints; and that he responded that doctors could not obtain a LabScan with ferritin unless they paid the higher price. He also presented evidence that the no-charge approach was a deviation from corporate policy and was initiated by the heads of individual labs; that he did not find out about any price differential until years after it had been implemented; and that he sought to correct any price differential as soon as he discovered it. Thurston testified that he did not authorize, condone, or ratify a decision not to increase the price of the LabScan based on the addition of ferritin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) <i>Concealing Price Differential from Doctors</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston's labs took steps to conceal from doctors that, in addition to the LabScan charge, Medicare would pay an extra fee for the ferritin tests. No letters were sent to doctors advising them that Medicare would be charged separately for the ferritin test. To the contrary, in April and May 1988, letters were sent to physicians notifying them that the ferritin test was going to be automatically added at \"no extra cost.\" In Newbury Park, stickers were also printed and added to physicians' brochures and directories saying, \"Ferritin Automatically Included at No Charge.\" Of course, as to Medicare patients, these statements were untrue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston testified that he did not pre-approve the letters or stickers saying ferritin would be provided free to customers. Thurston portrayed himself as a hands-off manager who trusted subordinates to build in a charge to physicians and to accurately promote the expanded LabScan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several physicians testified they were initially unaware that Damon charged Medicare for the ferritin component of the expanded LabScan. A number of Damon customers protested, and even switched labs, when they belatedly discovered Damon was charging Medicare for ferritin tests conducted as part of the LabScan. When doctors told Damon sales representatives that they did not need the additional test, some were told that a LabScan without ferritin would cost more than a LabScan with ferritin. A major client referred Damon to a newspaper article criticizing the practice of bundling tests into panels and profiles, and warned Damon that its failure to educate doctors about the composition of and alternatives to its panels would subject it to ongoing criticism. Thurston was informed of these complaints, which were written up in monthly management reports he received in 1989 and 1990. Despite these complaints, Thurston did not cause a letter to be sent to doctors informing them of the extra charge for ferritin to Medicare.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Damon also collaborated with HMOs operating on a capitation basis (i.e., paying a flat monthly fee for each HMO member) to reduce utilization of bundled tests such as the LabScan. For example, one of Thurston's labs added to its HMO requisition form a checkbox for a LabScan without ferritin. Damon made no such effort to assist Medicare.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Availability of LabScan Without Ferritin</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston instructed subordinates to take specific steps that hid the fact that the LabScan could be ordered without ferritin and made it difficult for doctors to order the LabScan separately. For example, Thurston told the general manager of the Newbury Park lab not to advertise or promote the fact that doctors could still order a LabScan without ferritin. Similarly, Thurston helped make the decision to omit, from the Newbury Park letter announcing to doctors the addition of ferritin to the LabScan, the test code for ordering a LabScan without ferritin. The standard requisition forms used by Thurston's labs did not change following the addition of ferritin to the LabScan; there was a checkbox for the \"LabScan\" (which now included ferritin) but no box for the \"LabScan without ferritin\" or the \"LabScan with ferritin.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the conspiracy period, there were at least two ways for doctors to order the LabScan without ferritin. They could handwrite such an order on a standard requisition form, or they could request and obtain a customized requisition form with a checkbox for the LabScan without ferritin. A number of doctors and institutions took advantage of these options.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston testified that he did not tell anyone to conceal or refrain from advertising that the LabScan could be ordered without ferritin. There was testimony that, after Thurston learned in 1991 that the front of a requisition form used by one of his labs did not disclose the inclusion of ferritin in the LabScan, he instructed a subordinate to list it on the front and the form was so amended.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. <i>Apolipoprotein</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Damon also added an apolipoprotein test to its coronary risk panel in 1989. Before apolipoprotein was added to the panel, clients ordered it very rarely. The standard requisition forms Damon used after adding apolipoprotein to the panel also did not offer a checkbox for a coronary risk panel without apolipoprotein. Following the addition of apolipoprotein, the cost to doctors of the coronary risk panel increased by five dollars. Medicare reimbursed apolipoprotein separately at a rate well above five dollars. Thurston participated in the decisions about the addition, the requisition forms for, and the extra charges for apolipoprotein.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. Thurston's \"Reasonable Interpretation\" as Evidence of Lack of Criminal Intent</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston presented evidence that from 1988 to 1993 it was an industry-wide practice for labs to rely on the doctors who ordered tests to make determinations of medical necessity. Because, prior to 1994, doctors did not normally share their diagnoses with labs, labs did not have the information required to gauge medical necessity. Damon employees did not believe that they certified tests as medically necessary when they submitted HCFA 1500 forms with Medicare bills. Instead, they believed it was the doctors who ordered LabScans who made the certification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two expert witnesses testified that it was appropriate in 1988 to include ferritin in a blood chemistry panel. The bundling of different tests into panels was lawful under Medicare regulations. There was testimony that technological changes during the 1980s made it possible to automate the ferritin test, which presumably made it much cheaper to conduct. Witnesses for both sides testified that by 1988 some of Damon's competitors offered ferritin as part of their blood chemistry panel and so Damon added the test to stay competitive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Indictment and Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 22, 1998, a thirty-nine paragraph single-count indictment charged Thurston and three other former Damon executives &#8212; Joseph Isola, Beno Kon, and Gerald Cullen &#8212; with conspiring to defraud HCFA in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> by causing doctors to order unnecessary tests by adding a test for ferritin to a preexisting panel of diagnostic blood tests, and by adding a test for apolipoproteins to a profile used to assess coronary artery disease. The conspiracy period was from July 1987 to August 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Isola, President of Damon, pled no contest and, pursuant to his plea agreement, was sentenced to three years' probation and a one-hundred dollar special assessment. Kon, Corporate Controller, died during the proceedings. Cullen, Senior Vice President for Operations, was tried before the district court in October 2001 and acquitted at the close of the government's evidence. In addition, Damon pled guilty on October 11, 1996 to conspiracy to defraud by bundling ferritin with the LabScan and apolipoprotein with the cardiac risk panel. The company was sentenced to pay a $35,273,141 fine, and later entered into a civil settlement under which it paid the United States and the state Medicaid programs an additional $83,756,904.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston was tried before a jury in November and December 2001. The trial lasted three weeks. At the close of the government's evidence, the district court granted Thurston's motion for judgment of acquittal as to the indictment's apolipoprotein allegations, ordered these allegations stricken, and explained to the jury that only the ferritin allegations remained. The jury found Thurston guilty. Thurston's subsequent motions for judgment of acquittal and for a new trial were denied. The procedural rulings at trial that Thurston attacks are described below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court sentenced Thurston to three months' imprisonment (with a judicial recommendation that the term be served in a halfway house), followed by twenty-four months of supervised release (of which the first three months were to be served in home detention). The court imposed a one-hundred dollar special assessment and no fine. The Pre-Sentence Report (PSR) had recommended a Total Offense Level of twenty-six and a Criminal History Category of one. The PSR identified the base offense level as six. It recommended a fourteen-level upward enhancement for an intended loss of at least five million dollars; a two-level enhancement for more than minimal planning; and a four-level enhancement for a leadership role. It also suggested that an enhancement for obstruction of justice was appropriate, on the grounds that Thurston perjured himself at his trial. The PSR recommended the statutory maximum term of sixty months' imprisonment and noted that both the statute and the guideline allowed for a fine. It calculated that Thurston had a net worth of $1,526,904.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defense contested the PSR's recommendations. Thurston requested a three-level decrease because the substantive offense of defrauding the United States was incomplete; a four-level decrease because Thurston was a minimal participant; and a two-level decrease for acceptance of responsibility. Thurston requested a downward departure on the grounds that he had an extraordinary record of charitable work and community service; that the offense constituted aberrant behavior; and that there was the potential for a large disparity with Isola's sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argued that Thurston should receive a two-level upward enhancement for obstruction of justice. Otherwise, it accepted the recommendations of the PSR. The parties agreed that any restitution had been made by Damon, the corporate defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court sentenced Thurston at a hearing on June 26, 2002 to three months' imprisonment, a period of supervised release, and no fine. The district court granted a fourteen-level enhancement for the size of the intended loss, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 2F1.1(b)(0) (1992 version),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> a four-level enhancement for an aggravated role in the offense, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(a) (1992 version), and a two-level enhancement for more than minimal planning, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 2F1.1(b)(2) (1992 version). The court did not explicitly rule on the government's request for an obstruction of justice enhancement, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1 (1992 version), or Thurston's request for a three-level decrease for failure to show completion of the substantive offense, <i>see</i> &#167; 2X1.1 (1992 version). Thurston's adjusted offense level of twenty-six and criminal history category of one yielded a guidelines sentencing range of sixty-three to seventy-eight months' imprisonment; this range was trumped by the statutory maximum of sixty months for a violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the hearing, the government confirmed that Thurston had been offered (and had rejected) a plea agreement \"along the lines\" of the one that Isola had accepted. Over the government's objections and arguments, the district court then departed downward on the basis of Thurston's record of charitable work and community service and the disparity between Thurston's and Isola's sentences. The court then solicited the government's recommendation about the extent of the departure. The government responded that, if the court chose to depart, then it should depart no further than the sentencing guidelines for a perjury conviction, which would be an offense level of twenty (six less than that of the underlying offense), for a sentencing range of thirty-three to forty-one months' imprisonment. The court then departed by at least sixteen levels.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government appealed the sentence and Thurston appealed his conviction and sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. THURSTON'S APPEAL FROM HIS CONVICTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston was convicted under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371, which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If two or more persons conspire either to commit any offense against the United States, or to defraud the United States, or any agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose, and one or more of such persons do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy, each shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Statute of Limitations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston argues that the trial court erred in not granting his post-verdict Rule 29 motion for acquittal, because the government had not proved an overt act during the limitations period, and in not sua sponte instructing the jury on the statute of limitations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute of limitations for 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371 crimes is the general five-year statute of limitations contained in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3282. Here, that five years ran back from January 22, 1998, the date of the indictment, less the six weeks during which Thurston agreed to toll the limitations period. The government, therefore, had to prove an overt act was done on or after December 11, 1992. The indictment properly alleged at least eight overt acts within the limitations period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston did not raise the defense of statute of limitations either before or at trial, did not request an instruction on the defense, and did not object when the judge instructed without addressing the issue. Thurston first raised the issue by Rule 29 motion after the verdict. The government says Thurston raised the issue too late. There is a preliminary question of when such a motion should be raised, a question affecting our standard of review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The statute of limitations is a defense and must be asserted on the trial by the defendant in criminal cases....\" <i>Biddinger v. Comm'r of Police,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99021\"><a href=\"/opinion/99021/biddinger-v-commissioner-of-police-of-city-of-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">245</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">128</span></a></span>, 135, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></span> (1917). Here the indictment adequately pled facts to establish that the crime was within the limitations period. Thurston was not required to raise the defense before trial under Rule 12(b)(3), Fed. R. Crim P. Nor would it have made sense for him to do so, since the defense depended on what the government proved or failed to prove at trial. In a criminal case a defendant need only plead as to the accusation of guilt in the indictment and need not raise the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense before trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Thurston mistakes these truisms for an argument that he need not raise the limitations defense at all before the jury delivers a verdict of guilt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government says Thurston has waived<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> the issue and may not raise it at all. Absent an explicit agreement to waive the defense, we treat the issue as a forfeiture and not a waiver, contrary to the government's argument. This was not an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right, the definition of a waiver. The issue of failure to assert the defense was viewed as forfeiture in <i>United States v. O'Bryant,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610896\"><a href=\"/opinion/610896/united-states-v-david-s-obryant/\"><span class=\"volume\">998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span>, 23 n. 1 (1st Cir.1993). The rule we use &#8212; that the defense of statute of limitations must be raised at trial and, if not, is forfeited but not waived &#8212; is the rule in most circuits. <i>See United States v. Ross,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"714125\"><a href=\"/opinion/714125/united-states-v-thomas-s-ross-and-john-collori/\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1525</span></a></span>, 1536 (7th Cir.1996) (\"[I]t is widely accepted that a statute of limitations defense is forfeited if not raised at the trial itself.\") (citing cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston has indeed forfeited<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> the defense that the government did not prove facts that an overt act occurred within the limitations period. The defense should have been raised at trial. Waiting until after the jury has rendered a verdict of guilt to raise a limitations defense for the first time is inconsistent with the characterization of the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense and would unfairly sandbag the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because this was a forfeiture and not a waiver, there is still plain error review available under Fed.R.Crim.P. 52. <i>See United States v. Olano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span>, 731-32, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The government's evidence established overt acts by the conspirators within the limitations period, so there was no error at all as to the statute of limitations, much less plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government showed that labs overseen by Thurston (and his co-conspirators) submitted tens of thousands of reimbursement claims to Medicare after December 11, 1992 for ferritin tests conducted as part of LabScan orders. The government also presented ample evidence that many of these tests were medically unnecessary and were submitted by doctors unaware that Medicare would be charged separately for ferritin.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> It was not credible that the ferritin test, ordered less than two percent of the time, suddenly became medically necessary thirty to forty percent of the time within the life span of the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston also argues he was entitled to a jury instruction on the limitations point. By failing to request a jury instruction and failing to object to the lack of an instruction, he has forfeited the argument. Fed.R.Crim.P. 30; <i>see United States v.

Thurston's three Rule 29 motions &#8212; at the end of the government's case, at the end of the defense case, and after the verdict &#8212; all argued that he lacked the needed criminal intent. Our review is of whether a rational fact finder could conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the government proved the elements of the crime, including intent. <i>United States v. Moran,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780048\"><a href=\"/opinion/780048/united-states-v-john-moran-and-nora-moran/\"><span class=\"volume\">312</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">480</span></a></span>, 487 (1st Cir.2002). Thurston also requested a jury instruction on reasonable interpretation of the law<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> and preserved his objection to the court's rejection of the instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston argued he reasonably interpreted the law as requiring that the treating physician, not the test lab, certify to the HCFA that the test ordered was medically necessary and reasonable, and that he and the company were entitled to rely on that physician certification. Specifically, Thurston contended that in the relevant time period an independent clinical lab did not violate any aspect of Medicare law by: (1) providing physicians with a panel containing a ferritin test, so long as the physician was given reliable and accurate information about the test and could select the panel without the test; or (2) submitting a reimbursement claim, using a HCFA form or otherwise, so long as a physician ordered the test performed. This is one of his primary arguments on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether a particular defense doctrine is germane depends on the crime charged and the facts of the case. This is where Thurston's argument falters. He argues that he could not have had the needed intent because employees of clinical labs, including Thurston, \"were unaware that they were actually certifying the medical necessity of each test performed for every patient\" and they could reasonably interpret the law to mean that the treating physician, not the laboratory, made the certification. The argument is beside the point.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston was not charged with making a false statement to the United States, the falsity of which turned on an ambiguity in what the law required. Nor was he charged with failing to make a statement required by law in a situation of parallel ambiguity. He was not charged with falsely certifying the medical necessity of the tests ordered. He was charged with the crime of conspiracy to defraud the United States by inducing physicians through deceit and trickery into certifying tests as medically necessary when the ferritin tests were not necessary, thus leading Medicare to pay for unnecessary services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston's knowledge of the Medicare regulations and of the fact that the ordering physicians would certify the medical necessity of the tests was, ironically, part of the proof of the crime, not a defense. Thurston cannot, under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371, knowingly conspire to mislead and manipulate doctors into certifying medically unnecessary tests which led to improper payment of Medicare funds and then defend on the basis that he committed no fraud because the doctors, not he, were the ones who certified the tests as necessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston's reliance on <i>United States v. Prigmore,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772431\"><a href=\"/opinion/772431/united-states-v-david-w-prigmore-united-states-v-lee-h-leichter/\"><span class=\"volume\">243</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2001), is misplaced. <i>Prigmore</i> is part of a line of cases charging false statements or failure to make required statements, holding that intent should be measured against an objectively reasonable understanding of the legal requirements to be met, and that a statement is not in fact false or fraudulent if it is based on an objectively reasonable interpretation of that legal requirement. <i>See id.</i> at 17-18. This court first applied this principle in <i>United States v. Rowe,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197937\"><a href=\"/opinion/197937/united-states-v-rowe/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 21-23 (1st Cir.1998), to a statement that was not in fact false under an objectively reasonable interpretation of a disclosure requirement. In <i>Prigmore,</i> the conspiracy charged was to defraud and impair the functioning of the Food and Drug Administration, in connection with its oversight and regulation of medical devices, through failure to file reports which were required under certain conditions. The fraud alleged was the failure to submit a pre-market approval information supplement to the FDA, but whether such a supplement was required depended on the interpretation of certain regulations. The same conditional requirement was true of certain testing reports. The question was whether defendants could objectively and reasonably understand one regulatory phrase, \"affecting the safety or effectiveness of the device,\" as being circumscribed by another regulatory phrase, \"intended ... conditions of use.\" <i>See</i> 243 F.3d at 15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No similar question was presented here. Here, the underlying crime was one of manipulating doctors into making false certifications so Damon could receive unwarranted Medicare payments. There is no material question about ambiguity in the underlying legal requirements and no germane question about the meaning of the law. There was also no issue of lack of fair notice of what the law requires, a concern underlying the <i>Prigmore/Rowe</i> line of cases. A reasonable person knows it is wrong to trick others into doing something wrong that one does not do directly oneself, especially in order to obtain personal gain. The <i>Prigmore</i> doctrine has no application given the crimes charged and the facts involved. Because the nature of the crime charged made the reasonable interpretation doctrine irrelevant, the jury instruction issue disappears.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C.

Each side submitted extensive requests for instructions, and there were disagreements.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> The court did resolve the most serious disputes over some of the instructions (for instance, on the reasonable interpretation/<i>Prigmore</i> question) and told counsel these rulings before closing argument. The court did not, though, review all of the requests. Thurston's counsel did not object to this silence before giving his closing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defense counsel did raise an issue after closing, and before the jury was instructed, that he wanted to put on record his specific objections to the government's requests. He did not say he had been prejudiced in any way by the court's failure to rule on the requested instructions before he gave his closing. The court replied that it would neither rule on nor hear argument on the proposed instructions. Rather, the court stated its understanding that the appropriate time to object was at the end of the instructions. Nonetheless, it did hear argument on the government's Request No. 8 (the compelled witness rule), and declined to give the instruction. It also heard argument on the government's proposed instructions No. 18 (conspiracy); No. 19 (unlawful objectives); and No. 22 (overt act). The only proposed defense instruction called to the court's attention was No. 24, on missing witnesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not, as Rule 30 requires, tell counsel before closing argument its disposition of all of the requested instructions. But counsel for Thurston had an obligation to bring this to the court's attention before the closing and did not do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without addressing the issue of whether Thurston has thus forfeited the Rule 30 argument, we choose to simply evaluate whether defense counsel's closing argument was adversely affected. <i>See United States v. Owens,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198347\"><a href=\"/opinion/198347/united-states-v-owens/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">739</span></a></span>, 753 (1st Cir.1999). It was not. One telling indicium that there was no prejudice is that trial counsel did not ever say to the court he would be prejudiced if he had to proceed with his closing without knowing the court's disposition of the remaining requested instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An even more telling indicium of lack of prejudice is that Thurston's appellate counsel has been unable to identify any specific areas of prejudice occasioned by the trial court's lapse. While in theory such a lapse could cause prejudice, the most that is argued here is that there was \"no detailed reference to important legal concepts regarding criminal conspiracy and the state of mind by which Thurston would be judged.\" Appellate counsel does not identify those \"important legal concepts,\" and we see none. As to Thurston's state of mind, the trial judge did instruct on the government's burden to show Thurston had a specific intent to participate in the conspiracy and to defraud the United States. The court instructed the jury to consider Thurston individually to determine if he willfully joined the conspiracy. The court, in turn, defined \"willfully.\" The court also explicitly rejected Thurston's reasonable interpretation instruction, and it instructed on good faith. These circumstances belie any claim of prejudice and Thurston's claim fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. Motion for New Trial Based on Dismissal of Apolipoprotein Charge</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston and his co-defendants were originally charged with conspiracy to commit fraud as to both the ferritin and the apolipoprotein tests. At the close of the government's case the court granted Thurston's motion for judgment of acquittal on the apolipoprotein test, struck those references from the indictment, and instructed the jury that this issue was no longer before it. The government did not thereafter refer to this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston now argues that the court should have granted Thurston a new trial after the jury returned because the apolipoprotein evidence irretrievably tainted the trial. The government rejoins that counsel should have raised the issue sooner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again, we bypass the issue of forfeiture and reject the argument that dismissal of the apolipoprotein charges tainted the proceedings. Thurston's argument that none of this evidence would have been admitted if the ferritin charges were tried alone is based on an unlikely premise. Where the evidence admitted as to a dismissed count would have been admissible as to a remaining count, the defendant has not suffered prejudice. <i>United States v. Rooney,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"679963\"><a href=\"/opinion/679963/united-states-v-john-p-rooney-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">847</span></a></span>, 855-56 (2d Cir.1994) (collecting cases); <i>see United States v.

The apolipoprotein evidence contradicted Thurston's claims about the extent and consequences of Damon's decentralized approach to the make-up, pricing, and marketing of its panels.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was little risk of prejudice for other reasons. The government did not mention the apolipoprotein evidence in its closing, and exhibits pertaining only to apolipoprotein were removed before the documents were submitted to the jury. Further, most of the testimony and documentary evidence in the first half of the case, before the court ruled on the Rule 29 motion, dealt with ferritin. These factors further minimized the likelihood of any taint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston's conviction is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. SENTENCING APPEALS</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Thurston's Appeal: Loss Calculation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Much of Thurston's guidelines sentence range (sixty-three to seventy-eight months) was driven by the loss calculation. Both the PSR and the government recommended an intended loss figure of more than five million dollars but less than ten million dollars. This resulted in a fourteen-level increase in the base offense level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston, not surprisingly, targets this loss calculation. He makes two arguments. The first is that the government was precluded by a comment to U.S.S.G. &#167; 2F1.1 from ever relying on intended loss unless the government first established what the actual loss was and then established that the intended loss was greater. This is a pure issue of guidelines interpretation, which we review de novo. <i>See United States v. Gonzalez-Alvarez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199782\"><a href=\"/opinion/199782/united-states-v-gonzalez-alvarez/\"><span class=\"volume\">277</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">73</span></a></span>, 77 (1st Cir.2002). The second argument is that the court's conclusion had insufficient factual support for a number of reasons, a contention reviewed for clear error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The guidelines interpretation argument turns on a comment that provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consistent with the provisions of &#167; 2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation or Conspiracy), if an intended loss that the defendant was attempting to inflict can be determined, this figure will be used if it is greater than the actual loss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 2F1.1, cmt. n. 7 (Fraud and Deceit) (1992 version).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston argues that because the government did not show actual loss, it cannot turn to intended loss. The argument is simply wrong as a matter of the wording of the comment. The comment directs the use of an intended loss figure when it is greater than the actual loss figure; the comment does not restrict the sentencing court's ability to rely on intended loss when there is no actual loss calculation available. Defendant's reading also makes little sense: it may be easier as a matter of proof to show intended loss than actual loss. Conspirators are held accountable for the loss they intend to commit. Finally, it is obvious on these facts that the intended loss was greater than the actual loss &#8212; some doctors quit using Damon when, to their disgust, they realized what the scheme was.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston next mounts a series of fact-based attacks on the intended loss figure of more than five million dollars. That figure is supported by the capital expenditure requests each of the labs prepared to obtain funding to buy the equipment needed to perform the increased ferritin testing the labs anticipated. Each CER included a financial analysis, one component of which was the estimated new revenue from bundling the tests. Thus, the intended loss calculation was based on the conspirators' own financial calculations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston argues the CERs, being mere financial projections, are not an adequate basis for an intended loss figure; that the CERs were based on an assumed best-case scenario in which no physician who ordered LabScans would decline to get ferritin tests; that, in any event, not all physicians who ordered the bundled test were tricked into doing so; that the conspiracy was not proven to last five years; that the conspiracy ended before five years had elapsed for several labs, given the different dates on which the labs bundled the tests; and that later, only one lab reported to Thurston.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A number of these are quickly dispatched. The jury verdict of guilt disposes of the question of the length of the conspiracy. Thurston's promotion out of management of three of the labs is irrelevant since he earlier conspired to produce losses intended to go on for years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston also argues that the intended loss had to be reduced under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2X1.1(b)(2) because the government's proof did not establish that the conspirators had \"completed all the acts the conspirators believed necessary on their part for the successful completion of the substantive offense.\" <i>Id.</i> There is no merit to the argument. There was successful completion of the offense: the tests were bundled and doctors were misled into ordering unnecessary ferritin tests. The complaints from customers about Damon's practices were confirmation the scheme had worked.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The closer question is the degree of precision the government must reach in showing intended loss. It is true that the CERs set forth best-case scenarios which assumed all doctors would order the bundled test without culling out the ferritin test. If the CERs stood alone, defendant would have a better argument. But they are supplemented by the fact that Damon made it extremely difficult for doctors to cull out the ferritin and order the LabScan without a ferritin test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the conspirators tried to hide from doctors the fact that there was a significant cost to Medicare associated with the bundling. The conspirators were maximizing the probability that all doctors would accept the bundling, without culling and without protest. The fact that the conspirators were not entirely successful in fooling all doctors does not lessen their intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have noted before that intended loss does not have to be determined with precision; the court needs only to make a reasonable estimate in light of the available information. <i>United States v. Blastos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199503\"><a href=\"/opinion/199503/united-states-v-blastos/\"><span class=\"volume\">258</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 30 (1st Cir.2001). There was good evidence of intent and some \"prospect of success\" for the fraud to reap over five million dollars, and that is all that the case law requires. <i>United States v. Orlando-Figueroa,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199119\"><a href=\"/opinion/199119/united-states-v-orlando-figueroa/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span>, 48 (1st Cir.2000). The best-case CER projection was a loss to Medicare over the charged five-year life of the conspiracy of $5,800,230. It was reasonable for the district court to estimate that the intended loss exceeded five million dollars, even allowing for the one to two percent normal order rate for ferritin tests. The government met its burden and Thurston offered little in rebuttal except his protestations of innocence. There was no clear error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Government's Appeal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given an intended loss of five million dollars, Thurston's crime led to the statutory maximum sentence of five years. The district court departed downward from the Guidelines range by sixteen levels, however, sentencing Thurston to three months' imprisonment to be followed by twenty-four months of supervised release.

He makes two statutory intent arguments: (1) that the internal structure of the statute means it should not be applied to cases already pending on appeal; and (2) that the presumption against retroactivity should apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Thurston argues that Congress meant application of the de novo review provisions in the PROTECT Act to be deferred until appeals arise from sentences entered after the Act became effective. This is evident, Thurston says, since the Act imposed a new requirement for the district judge to give a <i>written</i> statement of reasons. From this, Thurston argues, all provisions of the Act were meant to apply only to post-Act sentencing. The argument is plausible, but we are unpersuaded. Even before the PROTECT Act, a trial court was required to give some reasons, though not necessarily in writing, for a downward departure. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(c)(pre-PROTECT Act version); <i>United States v.

Much of the conduct regulated by this part of the PROTECT Act is that of the courts of appeals (and indirectly, the district courts now under closer scrutiny), and that involves conduct dating from April 30, 2003 forward.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston's fall-back argument is that applying a changed standard of review to a case already on appeal would have an impermissible effect on him under the Supreme Court's retroactivity jurisprudence. <i>See Landgraf,</i> 511 U.S. at 264, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117841\"><a href=\"/opinion/117841/landgraf-v-usi-film-products/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1483</span></a></span>. Not so. The change of a standard of appellate review is one in procedure for the courts; procedural changes that do not affect substantial rights are not usually considered impermissibly retroactive. This legislation is little different than the Supreme Court's changing the standard of review by directing the courts of appeals to decide ultimate Fourth Amendment questions de novo. <i>Cf. Ornelas v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118030\"><a href=\"/opinion/118030/ornelas-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">690</span></a></span>, 697, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118030\"><a href=\"/opinion/118030/ornelas-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The PROTECT Act's alteration of the appellate standard of review upsets no legitimate reliance interest by a defendant; it could not have induced alteration of the behavior that led to the crime.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> We see no unfairness to defendants in Congress's requiring a closer look by appellate courts at whether a district court committed an error in deciding that the guidelines permitted a departure.

At the request of the Senate, the Chief Justice, expressing the views of the U.S. Judicial Conference, did advise the Senate of the Conference's opposition to portions of the bill, including alteration of the standard of review. <i>See</i> Letter from Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist to Senator Patrick Leahy (undated), <i>available at</i> http://www.nacdl.org/public.nsf/2cdd02b415ea3a64852566d6000daa79/ departures/$FILE/Rehnquist_letter.pdf. The U.S. Sentencing Commission requested that Congress not act until the Commission had the opportunity to analyze data and study the matter. <i>See</i> Letter from Judge Diana Murphy, Chair of the U.S. Sentencing Commission, et al., to Senators Orrin Hatch and Patrick Leahy (April 2, 2003), <i>available at</i> http://www.nacdl.org/public.nsf/2cdd02b415ea3a64852566d6000daa79/ departures/$FILE/$TJstcg_comm_current.pdf. But judicial opposition to legislation on policy grounds is one thing; unconstitutionality is quite another. No real theory of unconstitutionality has been presented by this appeal, and so the issue is waived. See <i>United States v.

In his petition for rehearing, Thurston, ably assisted by amicus, argues that subparagraphs (3)(B)(i) and (3)(B)(ii) apply only in cases involving \"unmentioned\" departures, <i>i.e.,</i> departures on grounds not expressly considered by the Sentencing Commission. On this theory, because good works departures are specifically authorized (albeit discouraged) by the guidelines, this court is not authorized to ask whether, in Thurston's case, such a departure</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) does not advance the objectives set forth in section 3553(a)(2); or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) is not authorized under section 3553(b)[.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&#167; 3742(e)(3)(B). Instead, the argument goes, this court is bound to accept the judgment of the Sentencing Commission that good works departures are consistent with &#167; 3553(a)(2) and (b), and accordingly must limit its review to whether a good works departure \"is not justified by the facts of the case\" under subparagraph (iii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's response to this argument is less than clear. The United States contends that \"[n]othing in [the PROTECT Act] limits consideration of the factors in &#167; 3553(a)(2) or the Commission's intentions as set out [in] &#167; 3553(b)(1)[ ] to unmentioned departures, as amicus <i>curiae</i> argues.\" That statement is true as a literal matter, but it does not answer the practical question raised by amicus: whether subparagraphs (i) and (ii) permit the courts of appeals to revisit the Commission's determination that a particular ground for departure (<i>e.g.,</i> exceptional good works) comports with those provisions. The government does not directly answer that question. It does, however, strongly oppose amicus's argument that the courts of appeals are barred from considering the purposes of sentencing, the structure and purposes of the sentencing guidelines, or similar aids in evaluating the propriety of departures in particular cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, there is less to this dispute than meets the eye. For the reasons explained below, we agree with the defense that a court of appeals, in reviewing a departure under &#167; 3742(e)(3)(B)(i) and (ii), must accept and may not look behind the Sentencing Commission's determination that a particular categorical basis for departure is permissible or impermissible. At the same time, we agree with the government that under subparagraph (iii), a court of appeals is free to weigh the purposes of sentencing, the intentions of the Commission, and any other relevant considerations in deciding whether a particular departure is \"justified by the facts of the case.\" This reading both reaffirms the authority of the Sentencing Commission and broadens appellate review of sentencing departures on grounds not considered by the Commission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the focus of an appellate court's inquiry under &#167; 3742(e)(3)(B). Although most of &#167; 3742(e) is concerned with \"the sentence\" actually imposed, <i>see</i> &#167; 3742(e) (preamble), subsection (e)(3)(B) directs the court of appeals to focus on the \"factor\" cited by the district court as the basis for granting a departure. <i>See</i> &#167; 3742(e)(3)(B) (\"the sentence departs from the applicable guideline range <i>based on a factor that</i>....\" (emphasis added)). Amicus argues, and we agree, that the initial question under &#167; 3742(e)(3)(B) is whether the district court selected a categorical basis for departure that the U.S. Sentencing Commission has considered and authorized. Because the Commission has already declared certain factors to be permissible grounds for departure, Congress could not reasonably have intended &#167; 3742(e)(3)(B) as a warrant to second-guess the Commission's policy judgments on those matters. If, on the other hand, the district court cited as its basis for departure a factor that the Commission has not expressly considered, then the court of appeals must make its own determinations under subparagraphs (3)(B)(i) and (ii). Where, as here, the departure was based on a factor considered by the Commission (<i>i.e.,</i> exceptional good works), de novo review extends only to whether the departure was \"justified by the facts of the case.\" &#167; 3742(e)(3)(B)(iii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Implicit in this conclusion is an analysis of the word \"factor\" in &#167; 3742(e)(3)(B). That term, in this context, must be read to mean a categorical basis for departure, independent of the facts of the case (for example, \"good works\" generally). The PROTECT Act inserted a new subsection (j) in &#167; 3742 that forthrightly equates the term \"factor\" with \"ground of departure.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> In addition, the sentencing guidelines themselves, before the PROTECT Act, employed the word \"factor\" to refer generally to a basis for departure. <i>See, e.g., U.S.S.G.</i> &#167; 5K2.0 (2002) (\"Grounds for Departure\"). The Supreme Court adopted the same usage in <i>Koon. See, e.g.,</i> 518 U.S. at 98, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118044\"><a href=\"/opinion/118044/koon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2035</span></a></span> (referring to \"whether a discouraged factor nonetheless justifies departure\"). Interpreting the term \"factor\" in &#167; 3742(e)(3)(B) to refer to a categorical basis for departure is also consistent with this court's own guidelines cases, which have frequently used the term in that way. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Mejia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200184\"><a href=\"/opinion/200184/united-states-v-mejia/\"><span class=\"volume\">309</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></a></span>, 70 (1st Cir.2002) (referring to \"factors that are either encouraged or discouraged bases for departure\"); <i>United States v. Bogdan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199908\"><a href=\"/opinion/199908/united-states-v-bogdan/\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">324</span></a></span>, 328 (1st Cir.2002) (referring to \"factors that are explicitly or implicitly proscribed by the Sentencing Guidelines as bases for departure\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, there is some support for the contrary view, inherent in the government's position, that \"factor\" refers not to the categorical basis for departure but to the district court's fact-specific justification for departing in a particular case. For example, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a), which was amended by the PROTECT Act, is entitled \"<i>Factors</i> to be considered in imposing a sentence\" (emphasis added), and it requires district courts to take account of such case-specific matters as \"the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant.\" &#167; 3553(a)(1). Nevertheless, we are persuaded that the word \"factor\" in &#167; 3742(e)(3)(B) is better understood as a shorthand for a categorical basis for departure. Congress, in enacting the PROTECT Act, plainly employed the term in that way in &#167; 3742(j), and we hold that it intended the word to have the same meaning in &#167; 3742(e)(3)(B).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is also apparent that Congress did not intend &#167; 3742(e)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) as a license for the courts of appeals to second-guess the Sentencing Commission's determinations that specific factors are permissible or impermissible. In Part K of Chapter 5 of the sentencing guidelines, the Commission has identified specific mitigating and aggravating factors that, in the Commission's view, may justify departure. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.0 (2002 ed.) (\"[T]his subpart seeks to aid the court by identifying some of the factors that the Commission has not been able to take into account fully in formulating the guidelines.... Presence of any such factor may warrant departure from the guidelines....\"). The Commission has also prohibited departures based on certain factors. <i>See, e.g.,</i> &#167; 5H1.10 (race, sex, national origin, creed, religion, and socio-economic status); &#167; 5K1.2 (defendant's refusal to assist authorities in investigating other persons); <i>see also</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.0(d) (Nov.2003 ed.) (\"Prohibited Departures\"). For appellate courts to revisit such determinations anew in every case would undermine the authority of the Sentencing Commission, reduce uniformity in sentencing, and risk \"recreat[ing] the location-based sentencing swings that Congress sought to minimize when it opted for a guideline paradigm.\" <i>United States v. Snyder,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197800\"><a href=\"/opinion/197800/united-states-v-snyder/\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></a></span>, 69 (1st Cir.1998). Prior to the PROTECT Act, the Sentencing Commission's judgments were not open to such attacks. <i>See, e.g., Koon,</i> 518 U.S. at 95-96, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118044\"><a href=\"/opinion/118044/koon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

(even if forbidden factors are present to such an extent that the case is outside the relevant guideline's heartland, \"the sentencing court is not free to consider departing\"). There is no reason to think Congress intended to change that rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we hold that where the Commission has expressly considered and forbidden or approved (even if discouraged) a particular factor for departure, the court of appeals is bound to accept that determination and cannot revisit it under subparagraphs (i) or (ii) of &#167; 3742(e)(3)(B).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a> So in Thurston's case, because the Commission has determined that departures based on exceptional good works are authorized, we do not inquire whether such departures comport with subparagraphs (i) or (ii), and instead proceed directly to the question whether the departure \"is not justified by the facts of the case.\" &#167; 3742(e)(3)(B)(iii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a second component, which we do not accept, to the defense's interpretation of &#167; 3742(e)(3)(B). Amicus argues that in evaluating whether a departure on a particular ground is \"justified by the facts of the case\" under subparagraph (iii), this court may not refer to the underlying purposes of sentencing, the Commission's intent in its guidelines and policy statements, or other extra-record considerations. The reason, amicus says, is the same: it is the province of the Commission to weigh such considerations, and Congress could not have intended the court of appeals to re-weigh those issues when reviewing a specific sentencing departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p131\">\n      <span class=\"num\">131</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject this argument for several reasons. First, the PROTECT Act asks whether the departure is \"justified\" by the facts of the case. That calls for an evaluative judgment, not a mechanical exercise. <i>See</i> Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary 1228 (1993) (\"justify\" means \"to prove or show to be just, desirable, warranted, or useful\"). Nothing in the statute purports to constrain the sources that the reviewing court may consider. Second, we see no serious risk that the Commission's legitimacy or authority will be undermined if a court of appeals refers to the purposes of sentencing, the goals of the guidelines, or other policy considerations in determining whether, on the facts before the court, a particular defendant fits within a particular categorical \"factor.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a> Third, those considerations were a regular part of the test that Congress required of the courts of appeals under &#167; 3742(e)(3) even prior to the PROTECT Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, the district court not only may but must consider the purposes of sentencing and the Commission's relevant guidelines and policy statements when it imposes a sentence. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a); <i>see also id.</i> &#167; 3553(b) (\"In the absence of an applicable sentencing guideline, the court shall impose an appropriate sentence, having due regard for the purposes [of sentencing] set forth in subsection (a)(2).\"). The PROTECT Act requires this court to apply de novo review under &#167; 3742(e)(3)(B)(iii), and it would be anomalous for Congress to have required plenary review but restricted the sources of law or fact that may inform that review. Adopting amicus's interpretation would produce the counterintuitive conclusion that Congress, in expanding appellate review of departures in the PROTECT Act, simultaneously prevented the courts of appeals in some cases from reviewing aspects of the district court's reasoning. Congress could not have intended such a result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p133\">\n      <span class=\"num\">133</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For similar reasons, we reject the government's suggestion that we adopt bright-line rules against the consideration of certain kinds of information in our exercise of de novo review under subparagraph (3)(B)(iii). In particular, the government urges that we cannot consult district court opinions (at least to the extent not tested on appeal) or databases of sentencing decisions. Nothing in the PROTECT Act precludes us from considering such sources. To be certain, experience gained under the Act with the passage of time may show that particular kinds of information have greater or lesser value. Databases of sentencing outcomes, for example, may or may not prove pertinent, depending on their scope and the types of information they report. But we decline to adopt any mechanical rule restricting the information that the court may consider under &#167; 3742(e)(3)(B)(iii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p134\">\n      <span class=\"num\">134</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(d) <i>Deferential Review After the PROTECT Act</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also reject a final argument by the defense, said to be drawn from <i>Ornelas v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118030\"><a href=\"/opinion/118030/ornelas-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">690</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118030\"><a href=\"/opinion/118030/ornelas-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">911</span></a></span> (1996), that de novo review involves deference not only to the district court's determinations of historical fact, but also to its ultimate conclusions &#8212; for example, whether a defendant's good works are \"exceptional.\" It is true that in sentencing cases, \"appellate review must occur with full awareness of, and respect for, the trier's superior `feel' for the case.\" <i>United States v. Diaz-Villafane,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522865\"><a href=\"/opinion/522865/united-states-v-wilfredo-diaz-villafane/\"><span class=\"volume\">874</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, 49-50 (1st Cir.1989). We do agree that this court must defer to a sentencing court's findings of historical fact, even after the PROTECT Act. The Act did not alter the provision in &#167; 3742(e) that the district court's findings of fact must be accepted unless clearly erroneous. <i>See</i> &#167; 3742(e). Other circuits agree with this interpretation of the Act. <i>Mallon,</i> 345 F.3d at 946; <i>Jones,</i> 332 F.3d at 1300 n. 9. Indeed, the government concedes this point. To the extent amicus suggests that the court of appeals should defer to the district court's application of the departure guidelines to the facts, however, its argument is refuted by the plain text of &#167; 3742(e). After the PROTECT Act, that kind of deference is not ours to give.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>The Downward Departures</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p136\">\n      <span class=\"num\">136</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that each of the stated grounds for downward departure was in error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a> First, it contends that the district court was forbidden to depart downward based on a disparity between Thurston's sentence and the sentence of the company president, a cooperating co-conspirator who pled guilty. Second, it argues that departures for good works are discouraged, and that the facts do not justify a finding that Thurston's good works are so exceptional as to warrant such a departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) <i>Disparity With Co-Defendant</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p138\">\n      <span class=\"num\">138</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court felt there was an unfair disparity between a five-year sentence of imprisonment for Thurston and the three-year probation sentence for co-conspirator Isola. It viewed Isola as \"the architect, at least the prime architect of this conspiracy.\" Apparently the district court felt that Isola, Thurston's superior, was the guiltier of the two, and that this fact overshadowed other differences between their cases. Isola pled nolo contendere to willful blindness about the apolipoprotein conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p139\">\n      <span class=\"num\">139</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the law of this circuit makes clear, basing the departure on grounds of disparity in sentence alone between Thurston and Isola was beyond the district court's authority. <i>United States v. Wogan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564953\"><a href=\"/opinion/564953/united-states-v-russell-h-wogan/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1446</span></a></span>, 1448 (1st Cir.1991); <i>see also United States v.

Sidestepping circuit precedent, the district court referred to a statute that requires a sentencing court to consider not only the Commission's Sentencing Guidelines and policy statements, but also \"the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a)(6). This provision was unchanged by the PROTECT Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p140\">\n      <span class=\"num\">140</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet the same statute also requires that the court \"shall impose a sentence of the kind, and within the range [of the pertinent Guidelines], unless the court finds that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(b)(1). That is why, since as early as 1991, this court has interpreted the statute to preclude sentencing judges from departing downward based on \"a perceived need to equalize sentencing outcomes for similarly situated co-defendants, without more.\" <i>Wogan,</i> 938 F.2d at 1448 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p141\">\n      <span class=\"num\">141</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"more\" that is needed refers to circumstances not adequately considered by the Commission, and none have been shown here with regard to disparity. In the pre-guidelines era, the district court's attempt to avoid perceived unfairness would have had greater weight. The guidelines bind us and they bind the district court. The downward departure based on disparity in sentences among co-defendants was impermissible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p142\">\n      <span class=\"num\">142</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) <i>Good Works</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p143\">\n      <span class=\"num\">143</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second ground, based on Thurston's good works, poses the most difficult issue in the case. We have found disparity alone an impermissible ground; it is possible the trial court would not have granted so extensive a departure based on good works alone. It may also be that if the court had granted a modest departure on the second ground, the government would not have appealed. But the trial court did not differentiate and the government on appeal argues that any departure at all based on good works (like the departure for disparity) was contrary to law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p144\">\n      <span class=\"num\">144</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentencing guidelines discourage downward departures from the normal sentencing range based on good works &#8212; that is, civic, charitable, or public service.

The district court based its conclusion that Thurston's good works were exceptional on Thurston's \"record of charitable work and community service[, which is] unique, extensive and extraordinary.\" The court continued, \"I think the record should reflect that in over fourteen years of sentencing defendants, it's my judgment that no one had a more extraordinary devotion to charitable work, community service, and especially ... to his church.\" Thurston is a member of a church, tithes ten percent of his income, and devotes hours every week to unpaid service with the church in a variety of positions. Letters from his fellow congregants characterize him as a man of principle and impeccable character<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a> &#8212; characterizations undermined, of course, by the jury's finding of guilt. In any event, it is Thurston's record of good works, objectively measured, and not his good character that is at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p145\">\n      <span class=\"num\">145</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to his church activities, Thurston has taken family members and others into his home and has been helpful to his neighbors. For example, the parents of a woman undergoing rehabilitation at a local medical center stayed at Thurston's home for several weeks. On another occasion, Thurston and his family laid sod for an infirm neighbor. Save for his crime, Thurston appears to have lived a creditworthy life.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p146\">\n      <span class=\"num\">146</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue, however, is not whether Thurston engaged in \"good works\" within the meaning of &#167; 5H1.11 &#8212; plainly he did &#8212; but whether those works were exceptional enough to overcome the judgment of the Sentencing Commission that a record of good works is a discouraged basis for departure &#8212; that is, good works are \"not ordinarily relevant\" to the decision whether to depart from the guidelines. &#167; 5H1.11. We hold that a departure for good works was not justified on the facts of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p147\">\n      <span class=\"num\">147</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This circuit, even before the PROTECT Act, reversed departures based on discouraged factors where the record did not indicate that the defendant's circumstances were genuinely exceptional. For example, in <i>United States v. Bogdan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199908\"><a href=\"/opinion/199908/united-states-v-bogdan/\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">324</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2002), the defendant was a caring and generous father who had gone out of his way to support his ex-wife and who had expressed deep remorse for his crime. This court concluded that Bogdan's case was not so exceptional as to qualify for a downward departure based on either family responsibilities or acceptance of responsibility, both of which are discouraged factors. <i>See id.</i> at 329-30. When, on remand, the district court again granted a downward departure because it thought Bogdan's sentence \"unconscionable,\" this court again reversed. <i>See United States v. Bogdan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200118\"><a href=\"/opinion/200118/united-states-v-bogdan/\"><span class=\"volume\">302</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 15, 16-17 (1st Cir.2002). The <i>Bogdan</i> cases illustrate that the \"exceptional case\" hurdle for discouraged departures is a very high one. <i>See also Pereira,</i> 272 F.3d at 82-83 (family responsibilities departure, a discouraged factor, requires a showing of something akin to irreplaceability to qualify as exceptional); <i>United States v.

What is clear, however, is that the problem is not merely one of quantity. The context of the defendant's good works is important. Here, Thurston's position as a prominent corporate executive weighs in our analysis. It is hardly surprising that a corporate executive like Thurston is better situated to make large financial contributions than someone for whom the expenses of day-to-day life are more pressing; indeed, business leaders are often expected, by virtue of their positions, to engage in civic and charitable activities. Those who donate large sums because they can should not gain an advantage over those who do not make such donations because they cannot. <i>See United States v.

One group has estimated that about three percent of the $1.4 trillion the country spent on health care in 2001 was lost to fraud.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a> <i>See</i> \"A Sick Business,\" <i>The Economist,</i> June 28, 2003, at 64 (citing data from National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association); <i>see also</i> National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association, <i>Health Care Fraud,</i> at 2, <i>available at</i> http://www.nhcaa.org/pdf/all_about_hcf.pdf (n.d.). Health care fraud affects the financial integrity of programs meant to aid tens of millions of people in need of health care. Every dollar lost to fraud is a dollar that could have provided medical care to the elderly or the disabled. Almost by definition, Medicare fraud is white collar fraud, most often committed by educated people with responsible jobs. Thurston's executive position at Damon, which gave him the resources to undertake many of his charitable works, also enabled him to perform the crime. That fact seriously undercuts Thurston's claim that his good works are \"exceptional\" in context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p152\">\n      <span class=\"num\">152</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Were it not for the statutory maximum, Thurston would have been sentenced to imprisonment for more than five years under the guidelines. Thurston's good works are admirable, but considered in context, they are not so exceptional as to justify reducing the sentence for the grave crime that he committed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p153\">\n      <span class=\"num\">153</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The downward departure for good works is reversed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Upward Departure</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p154\">\n      <span class=\"num\">154</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's argument that Thurston's conduct warranted an upward adjustment for obstruction of justice based on perjury at trial need not be resolved, given our disposition of the other issues. The statute caps his period of incarceration at sixty months. It is noteworthy, though, that Thurston's testimony on key matters of fact was contradicted by multiple witnesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. <i>Fine</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p155\">\n      <span class=\"num\">155</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that the sentencing judge erred by failing to impose a fine on Thurston in accordance with the guidelines. Thurston argued, and the district court accepted, that he should not receive a fine because that would create an unacceptable disparity between his sentence and that of co-defendant Isola. Sentence disparity is an unacceptable basis for refusing to impose a fine and is plain error for the reasons discussed earlier.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p156\">\n      <span class=\"num\">156</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston contends that the government has forfeited its argument that a fine must be imposed by failing to object after the judge ruled. The government earlier took the position that a fine must be imposed and also argued that the court could not refuse to impose a fine on the basis of disparity &#8212; the only argument Thurston presented. In these circumstances, the issue was not forfeited. <i>See Gallant,</i> 306 F.3d at 1187-88 (holding that a sentencing issue was not forfeited as a result of counsel's failure to object after the court's ruling); <i>cf. United States v. Meserve,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199680\"><a href=\"/opinion/199680/united-states-v-meserve/\"><span class=\"volume\">271</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></a></span>, 325 (1st Cir.2001) (motion to strike unnecessary to preserve evidentiary issue where party objected prior to trial court's ruling). Even were this an instance of forfeiture, the district court committed plain error in its rationale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p157\">\n      <span class=\"num\">157</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before this court, Thurston attempts to defend the decision not to impose a fine on the basis that the statutory definition of his crime, which provides that a fine may be assigned, trumps the guidelines, which provide that a fine must be assigned barring special circumstances. The crime of which Thurston was convicted, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371, provides for a prison term, a fine, or both. By contrast, U.S.S.G. &#167; 5E1.2(a) says, \"The court shall impose a fine <i>in all cases,</i> except where the defendant establishes that he is unable to pay and is not likely to become able to pay any fine.\" (emphasis added). The defendant did not establish, or even seek to establish, inability to pay. The sentencing judge made no finding, implicit or explicit, that Thurston could not pay. The PSR estimated that Thurston had a net worth of over $1.5 million, and the minimum fine under the guidelines was $12,500.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p158\">\n      <span class=\"num\">158</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the sentence fixed by U.S.S.G. &#167; 5E1.2(a) is within the range contemplated by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371, the guideline is not trumped by the statute. <i>See United States v.

Here, there is no inconsistency and the district court was required to impose a fine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p159\">\n      <span class=\"num\">159</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston's conviction is <i>affirmed.</i> Thurston's sentence is <i>vacated</i>; the downward departure based on good works and purported disparity is <i>reversed</i>; and the order that no fine be imposed is <i>reversed.</i> The case is <i>remanded</i> for imposition of the statutory maximum sentence of sixty months in prison and for imposition of an appropriate fine. <i>So ordered.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The original panel opinion in this case issued on August 4, 2003. Thurston then filed a petition for rehearing challenging,<i>inter alia,</i> our holding that the district court erred in granting a downward departure for good works. The Federal Defender Office and District of Massachusetts Criminal Justice Act Board filed an amicus brief in support of Thurston's petition, arguing that the panel had misconstrued the de novo review provisions contained in &#167; 401 of the Prosecutorial Remedies and Tools Against the Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003 (PROTECT Act), Pub.L. No. 108-21, 117 Stat. 650.

Representative Tom Feeney, the sponsor of the amendment that became &#167; 401, was particularly interested in limiting such departures. Feeney stated that under the Supreme Court's decision in Koon, district judges were permitted to depart downward based on \"any factor not explicitly disapproved by the sentencing commission.... So judges can make up exceptions as they go along.\" 149 Cong. Rec. H2422-23 (daily ed. March 27, 2003) (statement of Rep. Feeney). At a different point, Rep. Feeney referred to a need to prevent \"ad hoc departures based on vague grounds, such as `general mitigating circumstances.'\"<i>Id.</i> at H2423.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">These statements certainly illuminate one of Congress's purposes in the PROTECT Act, but they do not meaningfully assist our interpretation of &#167; 3742(e)(3)(B). Rep. Feeney's concerns about unmentioned departures are consistent with the overarching purpose of the PROTECT Act to reduce the incidence of downward departures generally. Moreover, Congress apparently rejected Rep. Feeney's initial proposal to eliminate <i>all</i> departures on unmentioned grounds. <i>See id.</i> at 2420-21. And none of the parties has cited, and we have not discovered, any legislative history addressing the specific issue here: whether Congress intended the courts of appeals to engage in de novo review under subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of &#167; 3742(e)(3)(B) even where the ground for departure selected by the district court has been expressly approved by the Sentencing Commission.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn21\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21_ref\">21</a>\n        <p> This interpretation is also consistent with &#167; 3742(f), another provision amended by the PROTECT Act. That section establishes the circumstances under which the court of appeals may remand a case for re-sentencing. Subparagraph (2) addresses remands in departure cases. In language obviously intended to mirror the substance of &#167; 3742(e)(3), it permits the court of appeals to vacate a departure and remand if \"the district court failed to provide the required statement of reasons in the order of judgment and commitment,<i>or the departure is based on an impermissible factor,</i> or is to an unreasonable degree....\" &#167; 3742(f)(2) (emphasis added).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn22\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22_ref\">22</a>\n        <p> This conclusion is slightly different from amicus's position that subparagraphs (i) and (ii) simply \"do not apply\" to mentioned departures. There is no basis in the statute to hold those subparagraphs<i>inapplicable</i> to certain types of departures. Properly framed, the question is whether a ground for departure endorsed by the Commission can ever fail the tests set forth in &#167; 3742(e)(3)(B)(i) and (ii).

I think the record should reflect that in over fourteen years of sentencing defendants, it's my judgment that no one had a more extraordinary devotion to charitable work, community service, and especially his dedication to his church.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">And the second ground is that which is set out in the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines Manual under Chapter 1, Part A, Section 3, which is entitled... \"The Basic Approach, paren, policy statement, closed paren,\" setting forth the rationale of the guidelines, it's cited here that Congress sought reasonable uniformity in sentencing by narrowing the wide disparity in sentences imposed for similar criminal offenses committed by similar offenders.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Congress sought proportionality in sentencing through a system that imposes appropriately different sentences for criminal conduct of differing severity.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">We have a situation here where coconspirator Isola, the president of Damon and the architect, at least the prime architect of this conspiracy, received a sentence of three years' probation, and it is, in my judgment, a violation of the fundamental purpose of the Sentencing Commission Guidelines to impose a sentence which is not at least somewhat similar to that incurred by a coconspirator who was more involved in the conspiracy t[h]an this defendant.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn26\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26_ref\">26</a>\n        <p> Good works may also be considered in setting a sentence within the guidelines range or in setting certain conditions. This does Thurston no good, however, since the applicable guidelines range is sixty-three to seventy-eight months, all above the statutory maximum of sixty months</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn27\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27_ref\">27</a>\n        <p> During the trial, numerous witnesses for both sides testified to Thurston's reputation for honesty and integrity. During the sentencing phase, many of Thurston's friends and family members explicitly or implicitly said they thought the jury verdict was incorrect</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Good character is covered by the aberrant behavior guidelines, and there is no argument on appeal that Thurston was entitled to a departure on those grounds.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn28\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28_ref\">28</a>\n        <p> <i>See</i> Mary Kreiner Ramirez, <i>Just in Crime: Guiding Economic Crime Reform After the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002,</i> 34 Loy.
