Defendant    Zefer    Corporation\n\n(\"Zefer\") seeks review of a preliminary injunction prohibiting it\n\nfrom using a \"scraper tool\" to collect pricing information from the\n\nwebsite of plaintiff EF Cultural Travel BV (\"EF\").                 This court\n\nearlier upheld the injunction against co-defendant Explorica, Inc.\n\n(\"Explorica\").     EF Cultural Travel BV v. Explorica, Inc., 274 F.3d\n\n577 (1st Cir. 2001) (\"EF I\").             The validity of the injunction as\n\napplied to Zefer was not addressed because Zefer's appeal was\n\nstayed when it filed for bankruptcy, but the stay has now been\n\nlifted.\n\n            EF and Explorica are competitors in the student travel\n\nbusiness.    Explorica was started in the spring of 2000 by several\n\nformer EF employees who aimed to compete in part by copying EF's\n\nprices    from   EF's    website    and    setting   Explorica's   own    prices\n\nslightly lower.         EF's website permits a visitor to the site to\n\nsearch its tour database and view the prices for tours meeting\n\nspecified   criteria      such   as   gateway   (e.g.,   departure)      cities,\n\ndestination cities, and tour duration.               In June 2000, Explorica\n\nhired Zefer, which provides computer-related expertise, to build a\n\nscraper tool that could \"scrape\" the prices from EF's website and\n\ndownload them into an Excel spreadsheet.\n\n            A scraper, also called a \"robot\" or \"bot,\" is nothing\n\nmore than a computer program that accesses information contained in\n\na succession of webpages stored on the accessed computer. Strictly\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fspeaking, the accessed information is not the graphical interface\n\nseen by the user but rather the HTML source code--available to\n\nanyone who views the site--that generates the graphical interface.\n\nThis information is then downloaded to the user's computer.                                The\n\nscraper program used in this case was not designed to copy all of\n\nthe information on the accessed pages (e.g., the descriptions of\n\nthe tours), but rather only the price for each tour through each\n\npossible gateway city.\n\n               Zefer built a scraper tool that scraped two years of\n\npricing data from EF's website.                  After receiving the pricing data\n\nfrom       Zefer,    Explorica         set    its    own    prices    for    the    public,\n\nundercutting EF's prices an average of five percent. EF discovered\n\nExplorica's         use    of    the     scraper     tool    during    discovery      in   an\n\nunrelated      state-court         action      brought      by    Explorica's      President\n\nagainst EF for back wages.\n\n               EF then sued Zefer, Explorica, and several of Explorica's\n\nemployees in federal court.1                  Pertinently, EF sought a preliminary\n\ninjunction on the ground that the copying violated the federal\n\nCopyright      Act,       17    U.S.C.    ยง    101   et    seq.    (2000),   and     various\n\nprovisions of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (\"CFAA\"), 18 U.S.C.\n\nยง 1030 (2000).            The district court refused to grant EF summary\n\n\n\n       1\n      The individual defendants are Olle Olsson, Peter Nilsson,\nPhilip Gormley, Alexandra Bernadotte, Anders Ericksson, Deborah\nJohnson, and Stefan Nilsson. We refer hereafter to Explorica and\nthe individual defendants collectively as \"Explorica.\"\n\n                                               -3-\n\fjudgment on its copyright claim, but it did issue a preliminary\n\ninjunction against all defendants based on one provision of the\n\nCFAA, ruling that the use of the scraper tool went beyond the\n\n\"reasonable expectations\" of ordinary users.             The preliminary\n\ninjunction states inter alia:\n\n          [D]efendant Explorica, Inc., its officers,\n          agents, servants, employees, successors and\n          assigns, all persons acting in concert or\n          participation with Explorica, Inc., and/or\n          acting on its behalf or direction are\n          preliminarily enjoined to . . . refrain,\n          whether directly or indirectly, from the use\n          of a \"scraper\" program, or any other similar\n          computer tool, to access any data useable or\n          necessary for the compilation of prices on or\n          from the website of plaintiff EF Cultural\n          Travel and its related entities, and/or the EF\n          Tour Database.\n\n          The defendants appealed, but soon after briefing was\n\ncompleted,     Zefer   filed   for   bankruptcy    and   its     appeal     was\n\nautomatically stayed.     11 U.S.C. ยง 362(a)(1) (2000).          Explorica's\n\nappeal went forward and in EF I a panel of this court upheld the\n\npreliminary injunction against Explorica.         The panel held that the\n\nuse of the scraper tool exceeded the defendants' authorized access\n\nto EF's website because (according to the district court's findings\n\nfor the preliminary injunction) access was facilitated by use of\n\nconfidential    information    obtained    in   violation   of    the     broad\n\nconfidentiality agreement signed by EF's former employees.                EF I,\n\n274 F.3d at 582-84.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f          On Zefer's re-activated appeal, the question presented is\n\nwhether the preliminary injunction is proper as to Zefer.             We\n\nconclude that it is proper even as to Zefer, which signed no\n\nconfidentiality agreement, but on relatively narrow grounds. Given\n\nthe prospect of further proceedings--this appeal is merely from a\n\npreliminary injunction--it is helpful to explain where and why our\n\nown reasoning differs from that of the district court.                The\n\nprincipal issues are legal ones as to which our review is de novo.\n\nCablevision of Boston, Inc. v. Pub. Improvement Comm'n, 184 F.3d\n\n88, 96 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n          EF argues at the outset that our decision in EF I is\n\ndecisive as to Zefer.    But the ground we adopted there in upholding\n\nthe injunction as to the other defendants was that they had\n\napparently     used   confidential    information   to   facilitate   the\n\nobtaining of the EF data.       Explorica was created by former EF\n\nemployees, some of whom were subject to confidentiality agreements.\n\nZefer's position in that respect is quite different than that of\n\nExplorica or former EF employees. It signed no such agreement, and\n\nits prior knowledge as to the agreement is an open question.\n\n             EF suggests that Zefer must have known that information\n\nprovided to it by Explorica had been improperly obtained.        This is\n\npossible but not certain, and there are no express district court\n\nfindings on this issue; indeed, given the district court's much\n\nbroader basis for its injunction, it had no reason to make any\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fdetailed findings as to the role of the confidentiality agreement.\n\nWhat can be gleaned from the record as to Zefer's knowledge\n\ncertainly does not permit us to make on appeal the finding urged by\n\nEF.\n\n          What appears to have happened is that Philip Gormley,\n\nExplorica's   Chief   Information   Officer   and   EF's   former   Vice\n\nPresident of Information Strategy, e-mailed Zefer a description of\n\nhow EF's website was structured and identified the information that\n\nExplorica wanted to have copied; this may have facilitated Zefer's\n\ndevelopment of the scraper tool, but there is no indication that\n\nthe structural information was unavailable from perusal of the\n\nwebsite or that Zefer would have known that it was information\n\nsubject to a confidentiality agreement.\n\n          EF also claims that Gormley e-mailed Zefer the \"codes\"\n\nidentifying in computer shorthand the names of EF's gateway and\n\ndestination cities.    These codes were used to direct the      scraper\n\ntool to the specific pages on EF's website that contained EF's\n\npricing information.    But, again, it appears that the codes could\n\nbe extracted more slowly by examining EF's webpages manually,2 so\n\nit is far from clear that Zefer would have had to know that they\n\n\n\n      2\n      As an example, the website address for an EF Tour to Paris\nand Geneva leaving from Boston is http://www.eftours.com/\npublic/browse/browse_detail.asp?CTID=PTG%20V&GW=BOS.     Looking\nclosely at the website address, one can determine that the\ndestination code for the Paris and Geneva tour is PTG, while the\ngateway code for Boston is BOS.\n\n                                -6-\n\fwere confidential.   The only information that Zefer received that\n\nwas described as confidential (passwords for tour-leader access)\n\napparently had no role in the scraper project.\n\n          EF's alternative ground for affirmance is the rationale\n\nadopted by the district court for the preliminary injunction. That\n\ncourt relied on its \"reasonable expectations\" test as a gloss on\n\nthe CFAA and then applied it to the facts of this case.    Although\n\nwe bypassed the issue in EF I, the district court's rationale would\n\nembrace Zefer as readily as Explorica itself.        But the gloss\n\npresents a pure question of law to be reviewed de novo and, on this\n\nissue, we differ with the district court.\n\n          The CFAA provision relied upon by the district court\n\nstates:\n\n          Whoever . . . knowingly and with intent to\n          defraud, accesses a protected computer without\n          authorization, or exceeds authorized access,\n          and by means of such conduct furthers the\n          intended fraud and obtains anything of value,\n          unless the object of the fraud and the thing\n          obtained consists only of the use of the\n          computer and the value of such use is not more\n          than $ 5,000 in any 1-year period . . . shall\n          be punished as provided in subsection (c) of\n          this section.\n\n\n18 U.S.C. ยง 1030(a)(4).   The statute defines \"exceeds authorized\n\naccess\" as \"to access a computer with authorization and to use such\n\naccess to obtain or alter information in the computer that the\n\naccesser is not entitled so to obtain or alter.\"   Id. ยง 1030(e)(6).\n\nThe CFAA furnishes a civil remedy for individuals who suffer\n\n                                -7-\n\fdamages or loss as a result of a violation of the above section.\n\nId. ยง 1030(g).\n\n          At    the   outset,   one    might    think      that   EF    could   have\n\ndifficulty in showing an intent to defraud.                   But Zefer did not\n\nbrief the issue on the original appeal before bankruptcy.                         In\n\naddition, there may be an argument that the fraud requirement\n\nshould not pertain to injunctive relief.              Accordingly, we bypass\n\nthese matters and assume that the fraud requirement has been\n\nsatisfied or is not an obstacle to the injunction.\n\n          The    issue,   then,       is    whether     use    of      the   scraper\n\n\"exceed[ed] authorized access.\"            A lack of authorization could be\n\nestablished by an explicit statement on the website restricting\n\naccess.   (Whether     public   policy       might    in   turn     limit    certain\n\nrestrictions is a separate issue.)            Many webpages contain lengthy\n\nlimiting conditions, including limitations on the use of scrapers.3\n\nHowever, at the time of Zefer's use of the scraper, EF had no such\n\nexplicit prohibition in place, although it may well use one now.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      For example, the \"legal notices\" on one familiar website\nstate that \"you may print or download one copy of the materials or\ncontent on this site on any single computer for your personal, non-\ncommercial use, provided you keep intact all copyright and other\nproprietary notices. Systematic retrieval of data or other content\nfrom this site to create or compile, directly or indirectly, a\ncollection, compilation, database or directory without written\npermission from America Online is prohibited.\" AOL Anywhere Terms\nand Conditions of Use, at http://www.aol.com/copyright.html (last\nvisited Jan. 14, 2003).\n\n                                      -8-\n\f            The district court thought that a lack of authorization\n\ncould also be inferred from the circumstances, using \"reasonable\n\nexpectations\"    as      the    test;     and   it    said    that   three     such\n\ncircumstances comprised such a warning in this case: the copyright\n\nnotice on EF's homepage with a link directing users to contact the\n\ncompany with questions; EF's provision to Zefer of confidential\n\ninformation obtained in breach of the employee confidentiality\n\nagreements; and the fact that the website was configured to allow\n\nordinary visitors to the site to view only one page at a time.\n\n            We   agree     with    the     district     court   that    lack     of\n\nauthorization may be implicit, rather than explicit.                   After all,\n\npassword    protection     itself        normally    limits   authorization      by\n\nimplication (and technology), even without express terms.                    But we\n\nthink that in general a reasonable expectations test is not the\n\nproper gloss on subsection (a)(4) and we reject it.                       However\n\nuseful a reasonable expectations test might be in other contexts\n\nwhere there may be a common understanding underpinning the notion,\n\ncf. Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 9 (1968) (Fourth Amendment), its use\n\nin   this   context   is       neither    prescribed    by    the    statute   nor\n\nprudentially sound.\n\n            Our basis for this view is not, as some have urged, that\n\nthere is a \"presumption\" of open access to Internet information.\n\nThe CFAA, after all, is primarily a statute imposing limits on\n\naccess and enhancing control by information providers. Instead, we\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\fthink that    the    public     website     provider   can    easily    spell   out\n\nexplicitly    what     is   forbidden     and,   consonantly,     that    nothing\n\njustifies    putting    users    at   the    mercy   of   a   highly   imprecise,\n\nlitigation-spawning standard like \"reasonable expectations.\"                     If\n\nEF wants to ban scrapers, let it say so on the webpage or a link\n\nclearly marked as containing restrictions.\n\n            This     case    itself     illustrates       the   flaws     in    the\n\n\"reasonable expectations\" standard.               Why should the copyright\n\nsymbol, which arguably does not protect the substantive information\n\nanyway, Feist Publ'ns, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co., 499 U.S. 340,\n\n344-45 (1991), or the provision of page-by-page access for that\n\nmatter, be taken to suggest that downloading information at higher\n\nspeed is forbidden.           EF could easily include--indeed, by now\n\nprobably has included--a sentence on its home page or in its terms\n\nof use stating that \"no scrapers may be used,\" giving fair warning\n\nand avoiding time-consuming litigation about its private, albeit\n\n\"reasonable,\" intentions.\n\n            Needless to say, Zefer can have been in no doubt that EF\n\nwould dislike the use of the scraper to construct a database for\n\nExplorica to undercut EF's prices; but EF would equally have\n\ndisliked the compilation of such a database manually without the use\n\nof a scraper tool.      EF did not purport to exclude competitors from\n\nlooking at its website and any such limitation would raise serious\n\npublic policy concerns.       Cf. Food Lion, Inc. v. Capital Cities/ABC,\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fInc., 194 F.3d 505, 516-18 (4th Cir. 1999); Desnick v. Am. Broad.\n\nCos., 44 F.3d 1345, 1351 (7th Cir. 1995).\n\n          Although we conclude that the district court's rationale\n\ndoes not support an independent preliminary injunction against\n\nZefer, there is no apparent reason to vacate the present injunction\n\n\"as against Zefer.\" Despite being a party to the case, Zefer is not\n\nnamed in the ordering language of the injunction; it is merely\n\nprecluded, like anyone else with notice, from acting in concert\n\nwith, on behalf of, or at the direction of Explorica to use the\n\nscraper to access EF's information.\n\n          Under the applicable rules and case law, an injunction\n\nproperly issued against a named party means that anyone else with\n\nnotice is precluded from acting to assist the enjoined party from\n\nviolating the decree or from doing so on behalf of that party.   See\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 65(d); G. & C. Merriam Co. v. Webster Dictionary\n\nCo., 639 F.2d 29, 34-35 (1st Cir. 1980).     There is no reason why\n\nZefer should be freer than any other third party who was never in\n\nthis litigation to assist EF to violate the injunction against it\n\nor to do so on EF's behalf or at its direction.     As we read the\n\ninjunction, that is all that is forbidden.\n\n          It may still be of practical importance to Zefer to have\n\nclarified the limited basis on which we uphold the injunction.   And\n\nnothing we have said would prevent EF, if it matters in continued\n\nlitigation, from seeking to show that Zefer did use confidential\n\n\n                               -11-\n\finformation, aware that it was being supplied in violation of\n\nagreements made by former EF employees.       It is also of some use for\n\nfuture litigation among other litigants in this circuit to indicate\n\nthat, with rare exceptions, public website providers ought to say\n\njust what non-password protected access they purport to forbid.\n\n              Lastly, Zefer has alleged that the First Amendment would\n\nbe offended if the statute were construed to forbid generally the\n\nuse of scrapers to collect otherwise available information where\n\nthere was no intent to defraud or harm the target website.              Here,\n\nthe   preliminary    injunction   is     premised    on    EF's   misuse     of\n\nconfidential information and Zefer thus far is constrained only in\n\nhelping   a   tentatively-identified     wrongdoer    in   exploiting      that\n\nconfidential information.     Cf. San Francisco Arts & Athletics, Inc.\n\nv. U.S. Olympic Comm., 483 U.S. 522, 541 (1987).            None of Zefer's\n\narguments address this narrowed constraint or suggest to us that it\n\nis constitutionally doubtful.\n\n              The preliminary injunction is affirmed on the limited\n\nbasis set forth above and as construed by this court.              Each side\n\nshall bear its own costs on this appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\f",

Explorica was started in the spring of 2000 by several former EF employees who aimed to compete in part by copying EF's prices from EF's website and setting Explorica's own prices slightly lower. EF's website permits a visitor to the site to search its tour database and view the prices for tours meeting specified criteria such as gateway (<i>e.g.,</i> departure) cities, destination cities, and tour duration. In June 2000, Explorica hired Zefer, which provides computerrelated expertise, to build a scraper tool that could \"scrape\" the prices from EF's website and download them into an Excel spreadsheet.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A scraper, also called a \"robot\" or \"bot,\" is nothing more than a computer program that accesses information contained in a succession of webpages stored on the accessed computer.

The district court refused to grant EF summary judgment on its copyright claim, but it did issue a preliminary injunction against all defendants based on one provision of the CFAA, ruling that the use of the scraper tool went beyond the \"reasonable expectations\" of ordinary users. The preliminary injunction states <i>inter alia:</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[D]efendant Explorica, Inc., its officers, agents, servants, employees, successors and assigns, all persons acting in concert or participation with Explorica, Inc., and/or acting on its behalf or direction are preliminarily enjoined to ... refrain, whether directly or indirectly, from the use of a \"scraper\" program, or any other similar computer tool, to access any data useable or necessary for the compilation of prices on or from the website of plaintiff EF Cultural Travel and its related entities, and/or the EF Tour Database.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants appealed, but soon after briefing was completed, Zefer filed for bankruptcy and its appeal was automatically stayed. 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362(a)(1) (2000). Explorica's appeal went forward and in <i>EF I</i> a panel of this court upheld the preliminary injunction against Explorica. The panel held that the use of the scraper tool exceeded the defendants' authorized access to EF's website because (according to the district court's findings for the preliminary injunction) access was facilitated by use of confidential information obtained in violation of the broad confidentiality agreement signed by EF's former employees. <i>EF I,</i> 274 F.3d at 582-84.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On Zefer's re-activated appeal, the question presented is whether the preliminary injunction is proper as to Zefer. We conclude that it is proper even as to Zefer, which signed no confidentiality agreement, but on relatively narrow grounds. Given the prospect of further proceedings &#8212; this appeal is merely from a preliminary injunction &#8212; it is helpful to explain where and why our own reasoning differs from that of the district court. The principal issues are legal ones as to which our review is <i>de novo. Cablevision of Boston, Inc. v. Pub. Improvement Comm'n,</i> 184 F.3d 88, 96 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">EF argues at the outset that our decision in <i>EF I</i> is decisive as to Zefer. But the ground we adopted there in upholding the injunction as to the other defendants was that they had apparently used confidential information to facilitate the obtaining of the EF data. Explorica was created by former EF employees, some of whom were subject to confidentiality agreements. Zefer's position in that respect is quite different than that of Explorica or former EF employees. It signed no such agreement, and its prior knowledge as to the agreement is an open question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">EF suggests that Zefer must have known that information provided to it by Explorica had been improperly obtained. This is possible but not certain, and there are no express district court findings on this issue; indeed, given the district court's much broader basis for its injunction, it had no reason to make any detailed findings as to the role of the confidentiality agreement. What can be gleaned from the record as to Zefer's knowledge certainly does not permit us to make on appeal the finding urged by EF.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What appears to have happened is that Philip Gormley, Explorica's Chief Information Officer and EF's former Vice President of Information Strategy, e-mailed Zefer a description of how EF's website was structured and identified the information that Explorica wanted to have copied; this may have facilitated Zefer's development of the scraper tool, but there is no indication that the structural information was unavailable from perusal of the website or that Zefer would have known that it was information subject to a confidentiality agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">EF also claims that Gormley e-mailed Zefer the \"codes\" identifying in computer shorthand the names of EF's gateway and destination cities. These codes were used to direct the scraper tool to the specific pages on EF's website that contained EF's pricing information. But, again, it appears that the codes could be extracted more slowly by examining EF's webpages manually,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> so it is far from clear that Zefer would have had to know that they were confidential. The only information that Zefer received that was described as confidential (passwords for tour-leader access) apparently had no role in the scraper project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">EF's alternative ground for affirmance is the rationale adopted by the district court for the preliminary injunction. That court relied on its \"reasonable expectations\" test as a gloss on the CFAA and then applied it to the facts of this case. Although we bypassed the issue in <i>EF I,</i> the district court's rationale would embrace Zefer as readily as Explorica itself. But the gloss presents a pure question of law to be reviewed <i>de novo</i> and, on this issue, we differ with the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The CFAA provision relied upon by the district court states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whoever ... knowingly and with intent to defraud, accesses a protected computer without authorization, or exceeds authorized access, and by means of such conduct furthers the intended fraud and obtains anything of value, unless the object of the fraud and the thing obtained consists only of the use of the computer and the value of such use is not more than $ 5,000 in any 1-year period ... shall be punished as provided in subsection (c) of this section.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 1030(a)(4). The statute defines \"exceeds authorized access\" as \"to access a computer with authorization and to use such access to obtain or alter information in the computer that the accesser is not entitled so to obtain or alter.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1030(e)(6). The CFAA furnishes a civil remedy for individuals who suffer damages or loss as a result of a violation of the above section. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1030(g).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset, one might think that EF could have difficulty in showing an intent to defraud. But Zefer did not brief the issue on the original appeal before bankruptcy. In addition, there may be an argument that the fraud requirement should not pertain to injunctive relief. Accordingly, we bypass these matters and assume that the fraud requirement has been satisfied or is not an obstacle to the injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue, then, is whether use of the scraper \"exceed[ed] authorized access.\" A lack of authorization could be established by an explicit statement on the website restricting access. (Whether public policy might in turn limit certain restrictions is a separate issue.) Many webpages contain lengthy limiting conditions, including limitations on the use of scrapers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> However, at the time of Zefer's use of the scraper, EF had no such explicit prohibition in place, although it may well use one now.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court thought that a lack of authorization could also be inferred from the circumstances, using \"reasonable expectations\" as the test; and it said that three such circumstances comprised such a warning in this case: the copyright notice on EF's homepage with a link directing users to contact the company with questions; EF's provision to Zefer of confidential information obtained in breach of the employee confidentiality agreements; and the fact that the website was configured to allow ordinary visitors to the site to view only one page at a time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court that lack of authorization may be implicit, rather than explicit. After all, password protection itself normally limits authorization by implication (and technology), even without express terms. But we think that in general a reasonable expectations test is not the proper gloss on subsection (a)(4) and we reject it. However useful a reasonable expectations test might be in other contexts where there may be a common understanding underpinning the notion, <i>cf. Terry v. Ohio,</i> 392 U.S. 1, 9, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968) (Fourth Amendment), its use in this context is neither prescribed by the statute nor prudentially sound.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our basis for this view is not, as some have urged, that there is a \"presumption\" of open access to Internet information. The CFAA, after all, is primarily a statute imposing limits on access and enhancing control by information providers. Instead, we think that the public website provider can easily spell out explicitly what is forbidden and, consonantly, that nothing justifies putting users at the mercy of a highly imprecise, litigation-spawning standard like \"reasonable expectations.\" If EF wants to ban scrapers, let it say so on the webpage or a link clearly marked as containing restrictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case itself illustrates the flaws in the \"reasonable expectations\" standard. Why should the copyright symbol, which arguably does not protect the substantive information anyway, <i>Feist Publ'ns, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co.,</i> 499 U.S. 340, 344-45, 111 S.Ct. 1282, 113 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991), or the provision of page-by-page access for that matter, be taken to suggest that downloading information at higher speed is forbidden. EF could easily include &#8212; indeed, by now probably has included &#8212; a sentence on its home page or in its terms of use stating that \"no scrapers may be used,\" giving fair warning and avoiding time-consuming litigation about its private, albeit \"reasonable,\" intentions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Needless to say, Zefer can have been in no doubt that EF would dislike the use of the scraper to construct a database for Explorica to undercut EF's prices; but EF would equally have disliked the compilation of such a database manually without the use of a scraper tool. EF did not purport to exclude competitors from looking at its website and any such limitation would raise serious public policy concerns. <i>Cf. Food Lion, Inc. v. Capital Cities/ABC, Inc.,</i> 194 F.3d 505, 516-18 (4th Cir.1999); <i>Desnick v. Am. Broad. Cos.,</i> 44 F.3d 1345, 1351 (7th Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we conclude that the district court's rationale does not support an independent preliminary injunction against Zefer, there is no apparent reason to vacate the present injunction \"as against Zefer.\" Despite being a party to the case, Zefer is not named in the ordering language of the injunction; it is merely precluded, like anyone else with notice, from acting in concert with, on behalf of, or at the direction of Explorica to use the scraper to access EF's information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the applicable rules and case law, an injunction properly issued against a named party means that anyone else with notice is precluded from acting to assist the enjoined party from violating the decree or from doing so on behalf of that party. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(d); <i>G. &amp; C. Merriam Co. v. Webster Dictionary Co.,</i> 639 F.2d 29, 34-35 (1st Cir.1980). There is no reason why Zefer should be freer than any other third party who was never in this litigation to assist EF to violate the injunction against it or to do so on EF's behalf or at its direction. As we read the injunction, that is all that is forbidden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It may still be of practical importance to Zefer to have clarified the limited basis on which we uphold the injunction. And nothing we have said would prevent EF, if it matters in continued litigation, from seeking to show that Zefer did use confidential information, aware that it was being supplied in violation of agreements made by former EF employees. It is also of some use for future litigation among other litigants in this circuit to indicate that, with rare exceptions, public website providers ought to say just what non-password protected access they purport to forbid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, Zefer has alleged that the First Amendment would be offended if the statute were construed to forbid generally the use of scrapers to collect otherwise available information where there was no intent to defraud or harm the target website. Here, the preliminary injunction is premised on EF's misuse of confidential information and Zefer thus far is constrained only in helping a tentatively-identified wrongdoer in exploiting that confidential information. <i>Cf. San Francisco Arts &amp; Athletics, Inc. v. U.S. Olympic Comm.,</i> 483 U.S. 522, 541, 107 S.Ct. 2971, 97 L.Ed.2d 427 (1987). None of Zefer's arguments address this narrowed constraint or suggest to us that it is constitutionally doubtful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The preliminary injunction is <i>affirmed</i> on the limited basis set forth above and as construed by this court.

What can be gleaned from the record as to Zefer's knowledge certainly does not permit us to make on appeal the finding urged by EF.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What appears to have happened is that Philip Gormley, Explorica's Chief Information Officer and EF's former Vice President of Information Strategy, e-mailed Zefer a description of how EF's website was structured and identified the information that Explorica wanted to have copied; this may have facilitated Zefer's development of the scraper tool, but there is no indication that the structural information was unavailable from perusal of the website or that Zefer would have known that it was information subject to a confidentiality agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">EF also claims that Gormley e-mailed Zefer the \"codes\" identifying in computer shorthand the names of EF's gateway and destination cities. These codes were used to direct the scraper tool to the specific pages on EF's website that contained EF's pricing information. But, again, it appears that the codes could be extracted more slowly by examining EF's webpages manually,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> so it is far from clear that Zefer would have had to know that they were confidential. The only information that Zefer received that was described as confidential (passwords for tour-leader access) apparently had no role in the scraper project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">EF's alternative ground for affirmance is the rationale adopted by the district court for the preliminary injunction. That court relied on its \"reasonable expectations\" test as a gloss on the CFAA and then applied it to the facts of this case. Although we bypassed the issue in <i>EF I,</i> the district court's rationale would embrace Zefer as readily as Explorica itself. But the gloss presents a pure question of law to be reviewed <i>de novo</i> and, on this issue, we differ with the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The CFAA provision relied upon by the district court states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whoever ... knowingly and with intent to defraud, accesses a protected computer without authorization, or exceeds authorized access, and by means of such conduct furthers the intended fraud and obtains anything of value, unless the object of the fraud and the thing obtained consists only of the use of the computer and the value of such use is not more than $ 5,000 in any 1-year period ... shall be punished as provided in subsection (c) of this section.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 1030(a)(4). The statute defines \"exceeds authorized access\" as \"to access a computer with authorization and to use such access to obtain or alter information in the computer that the accesser is not entitled so to obtain or alter.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1030(e)(6). The CFAA furnishes a civil remedy for individuals who suffer damages or loss as a result of a violation of the above section. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1030(g).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset, one might think that EF could have difficulty in showing an intent to defraud. But Zefer did not brief the issue on the original appeal before bankruptcy. In addition, there may be an argument that the fraud requirement should not pertain to injunctive relief. Accordingly, we bypass these matters and assume that the fraud requirement has been satisfied or is not an obstacle to the injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue, then, is whether use of the scraper \"exceed[ed] authorized access.\" A lack of authorization could be established by an explicit statement on the website restricting access. (Whether public policy might in turn limit certain restrictions is a separate issue.) Many webpages contain lengthy limiting conditions, including limitations on the use of scrapers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> However, at the time of Zefer's use of the scraper, EF had no such explicit prohibition in place, although it may well use one now.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court thought that a lack of authorization could also be inferred from the circumstances, using \"reasonable expectations\" as the test; and it said that three such circumstances comprised such a warning in this case: the copyright notice on EF's homepage with a link directing users to contact the company with questions; EF's provision to Zefer of confidential information obtained in breach of the employee confidentiality agreements; and the fact that the website was configured to allow ordinary visitors to the site to view only one page at a time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court that lack of authorization may be implicit, rather than explicit. After all, password protection itself normally limits authorization by implication (and technology), even without express terms. But we think that in general a reasonable expectations test is not the proper gloss on subsection (a)(4) and we reject it. However useful a reasonable expectations test might be in other contexts where there may be a common understanding underpinning the notion, <i>cf. Terry v. Ohio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107729\"><a href=\"/opinion/107729/terry-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">392</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 9, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107729\"><a href=\"/opinion/107729/terry-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The CFAA, after all, is primarily a statute imposing limits on access and enhancing control by information providers. Instead, we think that the public website provider can easily spell out explicitly what is forbidden and, consonantly, that nothing justifies putting users at the mercy of a highly imprecise, litigation-spawning standard like \"reasonable expectations.\" If EF wants to ban scrapers, let it say so on the webpage or a link clearly marked as containing restrictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case itself illustrates the flaws in the \"reasonable expectations\" standard. Why should the copyright symbol, which arguably does not protect the substantive information anyway, <i>Feist Publ'ns, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112568\"><a href=\"/opinion/112568/feist-publications-inc-v-rural-telephone-service-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">340</span></a></span>, 344-45, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112568\"><a href=\"/opinion/112568/feist-publications-inc-v-rural-telephone-service-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">358</span></a></span> (1991), or the provision of page-by-page access for that matter, be taken to suggest that downloading information at higher speed is forbidden. EF could easily include &#8212; indeed, by now probably has included &#8212; a sentence on its home page or in its terms of use stating that \"no scrapers may be used,\" giving fair warning and avoiding time-consuming litigation about its private, albeit \"reasonable,\" intentions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Needless to say, Zefer can have been in no doubt that EF would dislike the use of the scraper to construct a database for Explorica to undercut EF's prices; but EF would equally have disliked the compilation of such a database manually without the use of a scraper tool. EF did not purport to exclude competitors from looking at its website and any such limitation would raise serious public policy concerns. <i>Cf. Food Lion, Inc. v. Capital Cities/ABC, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766496\"><a href=\"/opinion/766496/food-lion-incorporated-v-capital-citiesabc-inc-lynne-litt-aka-lynne/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">505</span></a></span>, 516-18 (4th Cir.1999); <i>Desnick v. Am. Broad.

Merriam Co. v. Webster Dictionary Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"386218\"><a href=\"/opinion/386218/g-c-merriam-co-v-webster-dictionary-company-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">639</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span>, 34-35 (1st Cir.1980). There is no reason why Zefer should be freer than any other third party who was never in this litigation to assist EF to violate the injunction against it or to do so on EF's behalf or at its direction. As we read the injunction, that is all that is forbidden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It may still be of practical importance to Zefer to have clarified the limited basis on which we uphold the injunction. And nothing we have said would prevent EF, if it matters in continued litigation, from seeking to show that Zefer did use confidential information, aware that it was being supplied in violation of agreements made by former EF employees. It is also of some use for future litigation among other litigants in this circuit to indicate that, with rare exceptions, public website providers ought to say just what non-password protected access they purport to forbid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, Zefer has alleged that the First Amendment would be offended if the statute were construed to forbid generally the use of scrapers to collect otherwise available information where there was no intent to defraud or harm the target website. Here, the preliminary injunction is premised on EF's misuse of confidential information and Zefer thus far is constrained only in helping a tentatively-identified wrongdoer in exploiting that confidential information. <i>Cf.
