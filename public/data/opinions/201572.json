R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                        For the First Circuit\n\n\nNos. 04-1353\n     04-1572\n     04-2504\n                              UNITED STATES,\n\n                                 Appellee,\n\n                                      v.\n\n                       FAZAL UR RAHEMAN-FAZAL,\n\n                         Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n          APPEALS FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n           [Hon. Patti B. Saris, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                         Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                    Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                      and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Fazal Raheman on brief pro se.\n     Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney and John T.\nMcNeil, Assistant U.S. Attorney on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                               May 11, 2005\n\f              Per Curiam.    We have reviewed carefully the record in\n\nthis   case    and   the   submissions    of   the   parties.    We   reject\n\nappellant's arguments, and we affirm the amended judgments and\n\nthe decision revoking supervised release. We allow the motion of\n\nD.P. Lalwani to file amicus curiae brief.              We deny appellant's\n\nmotion to strike irrelevant pleadings.\n\n              Appellant Fazal Raheman (\"Raheman\") did not develop any\n\nof his current arguments below, so they are forfeited, and we\n\nreview only for plain error.         United States v. Olano, 507 U.S.\n\n725, 731-32 (1993).        Under any standard of review, however, they\n\nwould fail. To the extent Raheman argues that the federal courts\n\nsomehow have been divested of jurisdiction, the argument is\n\nspecious.      Raheman has been convicted of a federal crime, and\n\nthat conviction was affirmed.        See United States v. Raheman, 355\n\nF.3d 40 (1st Cir. 2004) (\"Raheman I\").            The federal courts have\n\nongoing jurisdiction over violations of supervised release.               To\n\nthe extent Raheman is saying his acts did not constitute a\n\nfederal crime in the first place, the time for making such an\n\nargument is long past; and in any event, the argument was\n\nrejected by this court in Raheman's first appeal.             See id. at 46-\n\n49.    It still is without merit.\n\n              Raheman's attacks on the Massachusetts state court's\n\njurisdiction     are   out   of   place   here;   he   must   litigate   that\n\nquestion in the Massachusetts state courts. The federal district\n\ncourt simply ordered Raheman to comply with the outstanding\n\forders of the state courts by returning his children to this\n\ncountry.     If he believes those orders are erroneous under state\n\nlaw, he must take that up with the state court.    It was entirely\n\nproper for the federal district court to impose that condition of\n\nsupervised release; and we so noted in Raheman I.     Raheman must\n\nallow that process to go forward fairly; and he must not, in the\n\nmeantime, defy the order of that court to return the children\n\nhere for a determination on the custody question.     Having chosen\n\nto defy that order (as well as the district court's order to\n\ncomply), he cannot be heard to complain that he might lose some\n\nadvantage he obtained by kidnaping the children in the first\n\nplace.\n\n           We also reject Raheman's argument pursuant to Baltimore\n\nCity Department of Social Services v. Bouknight, 493 U.S. 549\n\n(1990).    To the extent Bouknight does place some restriction on\n\nthe conditions of supervised release that may be imposed here\n\n(and it is far from clear that it does), the Massachusetts family\n\ncourt order was issued as part of a \"noncriminal regulatory\n\nregime,\" id. at 555-56, that is, the system by which custody\n\ndeterminations are made in the state family courts.      Thus, the\n\nBouknight argument clearly fails.\n\n           This has been a protracted and painful matter for all\n\nconcerned.    It began with Raheman's criminal act:   the kidnaping\n\nof his own children.     He has been punished for his crime, and\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fthat matter is closed.     But the American criminal justice system\n\noffers more than punishment; it offers a convicted criminal a\n\nchance   to    rehabilitate    himself.   In   order   to   rehabilitate\n\nhimself, he must do what he can to undo his crime.          Of course, in\n\na case like this, when young children are involved, the crime can\n\nnever be completely undone.         But at a minimum, the convicted\n\ncriminal in any case can abandon the fruits of his crime, that\n\nis, the advantages he gained through his criminal act.             Here,\n\nRaheman obtained an advantage by spiriting his children away from\n\ntheir home to a foreign jurisdiction, where he obtained favorable\n\ncourt orders under false pretenses.       He must undo that harm.     He\n\nmust return the children here and start over.\n\n              The federal courts have no jurisdiction, ultimately, to\n\ndecide the best interests of these children or to determine their\n\ncustody arrangements.         But we have faith that the state court\n\nhere is competent to make such judgments, including a judgment as\n\nto whether it is the appropriate court in which to decide the\n\nsubstantive questions; that it will do so fairly; and that its\n\nprimary concern at all junctures will be the best interests of\n\nthe children.      We also have been impressed with the efforts of\n\nthe district court judge and the U.S. probation office involved\n\nhere.    Their goal is laudable:      they want the children reunited\n\nwith both parents.      We admonish all parties to move forward with\n\nall due speed to achieve that goal.\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fAffirmed.   See 1st Cir. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                     -5-\n\f",
