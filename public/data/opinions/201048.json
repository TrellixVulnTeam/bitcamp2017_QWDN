This case requires us to\n\ninterpret a provision of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt\n\nOrganizations Act (\"RICO\" or the \"Act\"), 18 U.S.C. § 1962(b), which\n\nincorporates state law, here the Massachusetts criminal usury\n\nstatute.    Samuel Cannarozzi sued Peter Fiumara alleging the latter\n\ncollected from him several \"unlawful debts\" in violation of RICO.\n\nBecause the loans did not offend the Massachusetts criminal usury\n\nstatute, the district court correctly concluded the debts were not\n\n\"unlawful\"    within   the      meaning    of   RICO   and   properly   granted\n\nFiumara's motion for summary judgment.\n\n                           I.    Factual Background\n\n            Samuel Cannarozzi is an on-again off-again compulsive\n\ngambler.1     A series of football gambling losses indebted him to\n\nJoey Yerardi in 1988; in a short period the debt reached $22,000,\n\nbeyond his capacity to deliver the agreed upon weekly payments.\n\nCannarozzi     contacted        attorney     Steven    Marullo   who    referred\n\nCannarozzi to Marullo's client, Peter Fiumara.\n\n             Early in 1991, Cannarozzi met with Fiumara at Fiumara's\n\nmen's nightclub in Revere, Massachusetts.              Fiumara proposed to buy\n\nout Cannarozzi's debt to Yerardi in exchange for a promise to repay\n\nhim the sum at 3% per week.         Cannarozzi began weekly payments, but\n\n\n\n1\n   As we review a grant of Fiumara's motion for summary judgment,\nthe facts are narrated in the light most favorable to Cannarozzi's\nclaims.    González-Pérez v. Hosp. Interamericano de Medicina\nAvanzada, 355 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                                       -2-\n\fstopped     when   he   had    repaid    $40,000      because   of   a   federal\n\ninvestigation into Yerardi and Fiumara and the advice of a federal\n\nprosecutor who told him that \"the book on these individuals is far\n\nfrom closed.\"2       Marullo insisted that Cannarozzi continue to make\n\npayments.\n\n            In the following years, Cannarozzi seems to have kept his\n\ngambling under control, and he built up ownership interests in two\n\nrestaurants (with Marullo as his counsel).               When the opportunity\n\narose in     March    1996    for   Cannarozzi   to   acquire   an   additional\n\nrestaurant interest for $30,000, he actually returned to Fiumara --\n\non Marullo's recommendation -- to ask for financing.                     Fiumara\n\nagreed to loan Cannarozzi the $30,000, and the two executed two\n\n$15,000 promissory notes, drafted by Marullo, and dated April 15,\n\n1996 and June 10, 1996.        The funds on the first note were tendered\n\non April 15, 1996, and Marullo notified the Massachusetts Attorney\n\nGeneral of the loan on April 16, 1996.3\n\n            By the end of the year, Cannarozzi was back to losing\n\nmoney gambling and borrowed an additional $30,000 from Fiumara in\n\n\n2\n  Cannarozzi was subpoenaed to appear before a federal grand jury\nand testified in relation to his dealings with Yerardi, but not\nFiumara.\n3\n   The Massachusetts criminal usury statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\n271, § 49, discussed at length below, exempts lenders from its\npenalties for loans exceeding 20% per annum if they \"notif[y] the\nattorney general of his intent to engage in a transaction or\ntransactions which, but for the provisions of this paragraph, would\nbe proscribed . . . providing any such person maintains records of\nany such transaction.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 271, § 49(d).\n\n                                        -3-\n\fDecember 1996.     A December 1, 1996 note recorded this loan; on\n\nDecember 3rd Marullo sent notification to the Attorney General.\n\n          In the next two years, Cannarozzi paid Fiumara over\n\n$200,000. Cannarozzi met with Marullo and Fiumara in December 1997\n\nand asserted that his 1996 loans, which totaled $60,000, should\n\nhave been fully paid by that time.           Cannarozzi was told that his\n\npayments had only covered the interest, and Fiumara and Marullo\n\ndiscussed Fiumara's business partner who had been found executed in\n\nan automobile trunk with unpaid debts to Whitey Bulger.\n\n          In response to Cannarozzi's request, Marullo drafted a\n\nnote dated December 10, 1997 for $450,000 to pay his outstanding\n\nobligations to Fiumara.      Cannarozzi signed this note requiring\n\nweekly payments of $1,000, secured by a mortgage on the property of\n\nthe Sierra's Restaurant (\"Sierra's\") in Sudbury, Massachusetts, a\n\ncommercial interest owned by Cannarozzi.          Notice of the loan was\n\ndelivered to the Attorney General on December 16, 1997.\n\n          A new note dated April 24, 1998 for $550,000 extinguished\n\nthe $450,000 December 1997 note and all prior obligations.          It was\n\na non-interest loan requiring $1,000 weekly payments, also secured\n\nby Sierra's.    Marullo sent notice to the Attorney General the same\n\nday.\n\n          The    last   promissory    note    signed   by   Cannarozzi   and\n\nFiumara, also a non-interest loan requiring $1,000 weekly payments,\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fwas   dated    August    1,   1998   for    the   amount    of   $1,000,000   and\n\nextinguished the previous note.\n\n              Cannarozzi brought suit in January 2000 alleging a number\n\nof counts under RICO and Massachusetts state law against Fiumara\n\nand several other defendants.              The district court dismissed all\n\nclaims against the other defendants and several claims against\n\nFiumara.    Fiumara subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment\n\nwhich the district court granted in full dismissing the remaining\n\nRICO and state law claims against Fiumara.             Cannarozzi appeals.\n\n                   II.    Collection of an Unlawful Debt\n\n              In Section 1962(b), RICO provides that:\n\n              It shall be unlawful for any person through a\n              pattern of racketeering activity or through\n              collection of an unlawful debt to acquire or\n              maintain, directly or indirectly, any interest\n              in or control of any enterprise which is\n              engaged in, or the activities of which affect,\n              interstate or foreign commerce.\n\nId.   Cannarozzi's complaint alleges that Fiumara violated RICO by\n\nacquiring     an   interest    in    Cannarozzi's    commercial     enterprise,\n\nSierra's, as collateral on debts to Fiumara.                To fall within the\n\nreach of the statute (and Congress's power to legislate), Sierra's\n\nmust affect interstate or foreign commerce.                18 U.S.C. § 1962(b);\n\nsee United States v. López, 514 U.S. 549, 556-59 (1995) (discussing\n\nlimits of Commerce Clause power).            Fiumara has not challenged this\n\ncharacterization.        See, e.g., Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U.S. 294,\n\n300 (1964) (\"one can hardly travel without eating\").                The statute\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\ftakes a flexible stance on how the interest or control is acquired,\n\nand Fiumara does not question that his right to Cannarozzi's\n\nproperty as collateral qualifies as \"acquir[ing] or maintain[ing],\n\ndirectly or indirectly, any interest in or control of. . . .\"                       18\n\nU.S.C. § 1962(b).\n\n             The Act prohibits appropriation of such property that\n\ncomes about either \"through a pattern of racketeering activity or\n\nthrough   collection    of    an     unlawful     debt.\"         Id.     On   appeal,\n\nCannarozzi does not purport to have raised a genuine issue of fact\n\nconcerning    Fiumara's     engagement       in   a    pattern    of    racketeering\n\nactivity but rather rests the complaint on Fiumara's alleged\n\ncollection of an unlawful debt.\n\n             The three § 1962(b) counts dismissed by the district\n\ncourt   correspond     to    three    different        loans,    each    secured    by\n\nCannarozzi's interest in Sierra's. In Count 13, Cannarozzi alleges\n\na § 1962(b) violation based on the December 10, 1997 note and\n\nmortgage.    Count 16 involves the April 24, 1998 note and mortgage,\n\nand Count 19 the August 18, 1998 note and mortgage.\n\n             Because   Cannarozzi      relies     on    the     \"collection    of   an\n\nunlawful debt\" prong of § 1962(b), he must create a genuine issue\n\nof fact as to the loan's status as \"unlawful.\"                          RICO defines\n\n\"unlawful debt\" in § 1961(6) as follows:\n\n             \"unlawful debt\" means a debt (A) incurred or\n             contracted in gambling activity which was in\n             violation of the law of the United States, a\n             State or political subdivision thereof, or\n\n                                       -6-\n\f          which is unenforceable under State or Federal\n          law in whole or in part as to principal or\n          interest because of the laws relating to\n          usury,   and  (B)   which   was  incurred   in\n          connection with the business of gambling in\n          violation of the law of the United States, a\n          State or political subdivision thereof, or the\n          business of lending money or a thing of value\n          at a rate usurious under State or Federal law,\n          where the usurious rate is at least twice the\n          enforceable rate.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1961(6) (emphasis supplied); see Sundance Land Corp. v.\n\nCmty. First Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n., 840 F.2d 653, 665 (9th Cir.\n\n1988) (applying § 1961(6) definition to interpret § 1962(b));\n\nUnited   States     v.      Salinas,      564   F.2d   688,   689          (5th     Cir.\n\n1977)(applying      §    1961(6)   definition     to   interpret       §       1962(c)).\n\nAccordingly, \"to prove that what was collected was an unlawful debt\n\nwithin the meaning of RICO, [Cannarozzi] would have to show that\n\n[1] the debt was unenforceable in whole or in part because of state\n\nor federal laws relating to usury, [2] the debt was incurred in\n\nconnection   with       'the   business    of   lending   money    .       .    .   at   a\n\n[usurious] rate,' and [3] the usurious rate was at least twice the\n\nenforceable rate.\"         Durante Bros. & Sons, Inc. v. Flushing Nat'l\n\nBank, 755 F.2d 239, 248 (2d Cir. 1985) (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 1961\n\n(6)).\n\n          Cannarozzi's claim only survives summary judgment if\n\nthere is a genuine issue of fact presented by the record as to all\n\nthree elements.         The district court correctly assumed that if the\n\nloans in question were enforceable under the Massachusetts criminal\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fusury statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 271, § 49, then Fiumara deserved\n\nsummary judgment.4 The Massachusetts criminal usury statute states\n\nin relevant part, in paragraph (a), that,\n\n          Whoever in exchange for either a loan of money\n          or other property knowingly contracts for,\n          charges, takes or receives, directly or\n          indirectly,   interest   and    expenses   the\n          aggregate of which exceeds an amount greater\n          than twenty per centum per annum upon the sum\n          loaned or the equivalent rate for a longer or\n          shorter period, shall be guilty of criminal\n          usury . . . .\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 271, § 49(a).    In paragraph (d), the statute\n\nprovides an important exception to criminal liability:\n\n          The provisions of paragraph (a) . . . shall\n          not apply to any person who notifies the\n          attorney general of his intent to engage in a\n          transaction or transactions which, but for the\n          provisions of this paragraph, would be\n          proscribed under the provisions of paragraph\n          (a) providing any such person maintains\n          records of any such transaction.\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 271, § 49(d) (emphasis supplied).    The Supreme\n\nJudicial Court has explained that \"[w]hile parties may contract for\n\ninterest in an amount greater than twenty per cent, the Legislature\n\n\n\n4\n   The district court failed, however, to reference the § 1961(6)\ndefinition, with all of its necessary elements. The district court\nopinion is incorrect insomuch as it suggests that a debt is\n\"unlawful\" for RICO purposes merely by virtue of being\n\"unenforceable under State . . . law in whole or in part as to\nprincipal or interest because of the laws relating to usury.\" 18\nU.S.C. § 1961(6). In addition, \"the debt [must have been] incurred\nin connection with 'the business of lending money . . . at a\n[usurious] rate,' and . . . the usurious rate [must have been] at\nleast twice the enforceable rate.\" Durante Bros. at 248 (quoting\n18 U.S.C. § 1961(6)).\n\n                               -8-\n\fhas determined that as a matter of public policy persons who charge\n\nmore than twenty per cent interest must register with the Attorney\n\nGeneral.\"    Begelfer v. Najarian, 409 N.E.2d 167, 172 (Mass. 1980).\n\nThe legal -- and factual -- inquiry as to Cannarozzi's three RICO\n\ncounts becomes relatively straightforward: did Fiumara provide the\n\nAttorney General adequate notification for the three loans named in\n\nthe counts?\n\n            We review the district court's factual determinations for\n\nclear error and its legal conclusions de novo.               See Watson v.\n\nDeaconess Waltham Hosp., 298 F.3d 102, 108 (1st Cir. 2002).                  The\n\ndistrict    court   found   that   \"[t]he   record   is   clear   and   it    is\n\nundisputed that notifications to the attorney general were sent by\n\nMarullo on 4/16/96, 12/3/96, 10/16/97, and 4/24/98.\" Cannarozzi v.\n\nMarullo, Civ. No. 00-10164-REK, at 5 (D. Mass. Feb. 5, 2003).                The\n\nparties do not dispute this finding, clearly evidenced by the\n\nrecord.     The district court recognized that these notification\n\ndates did not match each high interest loan disbursed to Cannarozzi\n\nand explained that:\n\n            The wording of the [criminal usury] statute\n            plainly states, however, that the notification\n            applies   to   the    \"intent   to engage   in\n            transaction    or    transactions\"  and   that\n            \"notification shall be valid for a two year\n            period.\" Every loan at issue in this case was\n            made   within    two   years   of  sending   a\n            notification letter to the Attorney General of\n            Massachusetts.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fId. (emphasis in the original). That reading, that notification is\n\nvalid for two years for loan transactions during that period,\n\ncomports with the language of the statute, and Cannarozzi does not\n\nargue to the contrary on appeal.\n\n             Nevertheless, Cannarozzi demurs, contending that while\n\nFiumara may have provided adequate notice as to these three loans,\n\nthat does not make them enforceable by the terms of the usury\n\nstatute.      Cannarozzi argues on appeal, as he did in opposing\n\nsummary judgment, as follows:\n\n             Fiumara asserts the mortgages he obtained on\n             Cannarozzi's commercial real estate dated\n             12/10/97, 4/24/98, and 9/1/98, were security\n             for loans consisting of \"roll ups of past\n             debt.\"   Because the consideration for these\n             mortgages allegedly derived from Fiumara's\n             prior loans to Cannarozzi, plaintiffs argue\n             that if any of said loans were in violation of\n             Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 271, § 49, Fiumara's\n             procurement of the mortgages would also be in\n             violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(b).\n\nThe argument has some moral and policy appeal: a loanshark should\n\nnot be able to escape criminal liability -- and recover usurious\n\ninterest payments -- by the artifice of refinancing with notice to\n\nthe Attorney General.      Any successful argument, though, must be\n\ndirected not to the purposes behind RICO, see United States v.\n\nOreto, 37 F.3d 739, 751 (1st Cir. 1994) (\"Congress declared in RICO\n\nthat   the   statutory   purpose   was    'to   seek   the   eradication   of\n\norganized crime in the United States' and Congress listed 'loan\n\nsharking' as a means by which 'organized crime derives much of its\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fpower.'\") (quoting Pub. L. 91-452, § 1 (Statement of Findings and\n\nPurpose following 18 U.S.C. § 1961)), but rather to Massachusetts\n\nlaw. See Salinas, 564 F.2d at 691 (dispositive inquiry is \"whether\n\nthe   particular   State   involved   prohibits   the   .   .   .   activity\n\ncharged\") (quoting United States v. Nardello, 303 U.S. 286, 539\n\n(1969)). Cannarozzi provides no authority for the proposition that\n\nMassachusetts courts would refuse to enforce the loans in dispute\n\nunder the criminal usury statute.5\n\n            Looking closely at Cannarozzi's argument in the context\n\nof the first of these three loans, issued on December 10, 1997, it\n\nbecomes apparent that the court below did not err in concluding\n\nthat the loans did not violate the Massachusetts criminal usury\n\nstatute.6   In December 1997, Cannarozzi went to see Fiumara because\n\nhe could not handle his debt load.       The result was the signing of\n\n\n\n5\n   Cannarozzi cites one case, Levites v. Chipman, 568 N.E.2d 639,\n642 (Mass. App. Ct. 1991), which stands for the proposition that a\n\"loan [is] immune from attack as usurious\" if \"notice was on file\nwith the Attorney General at the time the loan proceeds were\ndistributed.\" This supports the argument that some of the earlier\nloans -- not at issue in this case -- would not have been\nenforceable because notice was served late or not at all. See also\nSchwartz v. Levensailor, 15 Mass. L. Rep. 177, 2002 Mass. Super.\nLEXIS 343,at *6 (Mass. Super. Ct. 2002) (loan at usurious rate\ndisbursed without prior notice not enforceable). Levites, though,\ndoes not help Cannarozzi explain why the loans specified in the\nthree counts, secured by his interest in Sierra's, would not be\nenforced in Massachusetts courts because of the criminal usury\nstatute.\n6\n   If Cannarozzi cannot show that the first of these debts was\nunlawful on a \"rolling up\" theory, the subsequent debts, properly\nreported as they were, would also be lawful on that theory.\n\n                                  -11-\n\fa new note, one that for the first time was secured by Cannarozzi's\n\ncommercial property interest in Sierra's.            Cannarozzi's argument\n\nwould require us to accept that a notification defect on part or\n\nall of an existing debt cannot be cured by a refinancing with\n\nproper notification.      We decline to endorse that interpretation of\n\nMassachusetts law, principally because Massachusetts courts have\n\napplied to     the   criminal   usury     statute   \"the    ordinary    rule   of\n\nconstruction    that    any   criminal    statute   is     construed    strictly\n\nagainst the Commonwealth.\"       Hakim Enters., Inc. v. Reinhardt, 566\n\nN.E.2d 115, 116 (Mass. App. Ct. 1991); e.g., Clean Harbors, Inc. v.\n\nJohn Hancock Life Ins. Co., 17 Mass. L. Rep. 468, 2004 Mass. Super.\n\nLEXIS 66, at *32     (Mass. Super. Ct. 2004) (declining to invalidate\n\notherwise    usurious    note   despite     notification     to   the   Attorney\n\nGeneral several hours after loan was disbursed).\n\n            On the face of the statute -- and the Supreme Judicial\n\nCourt's leading case addressing its meaning, see Begelfer, 409\n\nN.E.2d 167 -- notification to the Attorney General is an absolute\n\ndefense to the enforceability of the note in question.                   We can\n\nglean a rationale for this construction from a related area of\n\nMassachusetts    law,    involving      the   enforceability      of    compound\n\ninterest loans that are refinanced:\n\n            \"We think the term 'compound interest', as it\n            is   commonly  understood,   applies   to   an\n            agreement whereby interest thereafter to\n            accrue automatically bears interest.      Such\n            agreements the law has refused to countenance\n            principally for the reason that an improvident\n\n                                     -12-\n\f           debtor is not likely to realize the extent to\n           which the interest will accumulate.    Though\n           the term 'compound interest' may apply in\n           certain other circumstances, we think it does\n           not apply where interest has already fallen\n           due and has become a debt which, like any\n           other debt, may either be paid in cash or\n           reloaned to the debtor under a new agreement\n           that it shall bear interest.         Such an\n           agreement is not a snare which is likely to\n           entrap the unwary, for the borrower cannot\n           fail to realize the exact extent of his\n           obligation.\"     Household   Fin.  Corp.   v.\n           Goldring, 263 App. Div. 524, 527 (N.Y. 1942).\n           Where a debt includes accrued interest, \"if a\n           new note is given for the interest, it is\n           thereby converted into capital, and may\n           rightfully be given with interest.\" Ferry v.\n           Ferry, 2 Cush. 92, 99 (1848). Wilcox v.\n           Howland, 23 Pick. 167 (1839).\n\nCoupounas v. Madden, 514 N.E.2d 1316, 1321 (Mass. 1987)(emphasis\n\nsupplied).      Similarly,     Cannarozzi     had   the   opportunity    before\n\nsigning   the   new   note    to    realize   the   magnitude    to   which   his\n\narrearage had escalated.           Were his debts then unenforceable under\n\nstate law, Cannarozzi would have had recourse in state court under\n\nthe existing note.\n\n             Cannarozzi has presented us with no more than a remote\n\npossibility,    without      precedential     support,    that   Massachusetts\n\ncourts would refuse to enforce a note which refinanced usurious\n\ndebts.    Because \"[a]ny reasonable doubt as to the meaning of a\n\ncriminal statute must be resolved in favor of a defendant,\" Clean\n\nHarbors, 2004 Mass. Super. LEXIS 66 at *32 (interpreting the\n\ncriminal usury statute), we conclude that Cannarozzi has failed to\n\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\festablish a genuine issue of fact concerning the existence of an\n\n\"unlawful debt\" to Fiumara as to all three counts.\n\n                        III.    State Law Claims\n\n          Cannarozzi also appeals the dismissal without prejudice\n\nof a number of state law claims against Fiumara.         According to the\n\nsupplemental jurisdiction statute, \"district courts may decline to\n\nexercise supplemental jurisdiction\" when \"the district court has\n\ndismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction.\"           28\n\nU.S.C. § 1367(c).     The district court had dismissed \"all claims\n\nover which it ha[d] original jurisdiction,\" and the district court\n\nacted within its discretion in declining to exercise jurisdiction\n\nover Cannarozzi's     state    law   claims.      See Rodríguez   v.   Doral\n\nMortgage Corp., 57 F.3d 1168, 1177 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"As a general\n\nprinciple, the unfavorable disposition of a plaintiff's federal\n\nclaims at the early stages of a suit, well before the commencement\n\nof trial, will trigger the dismissal without prejudice of any\n\nsupplemental state-law claims.\").\n\n                              IV.    Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district\n\ncourt is affirmed.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\f",

Samuel Cannarozzi sued Peter Fiumara alleging the latter collected from him several \"unlawful debts\" in violation of RICO. Because the loans did not offend the Massachusetts criminal usury statute, the district court correctly concluded the debts were not \"unlawful\" within the meaning of RICO and properly granted Fiumara's motion for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Factual Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Samuel Cannarozzi is an on-again off-again compulsive gambler.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> A series of football gambling losses indebted him to Joey Yerardi in 1988; in a short period the debt reached $22,000, beyond his capacity to deliver the agreed upon weekly payments. Cannarozzi contacted attorney Steven Marullo who referred Cannarozzi to Marullo's client, Peter Fiumara.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Early in 1991, Cannarozzi met with Fiumara at Fiumara's men's nightclub in Revere, Massachusetts. Fiumara proposed to buy out Cannarozzi's debt to Yerardi in exchange for a promise to repay him the sum at 3% per week. Cannarozzi began weekly payments, but stopped when he had repaid $40,000 because of a federal investigation into Yerardi and Fiumara and the advice of a federal prosecutor who told him that \"the book on these individuals is far from closed.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Marullo insisted that Cannarozzi continue to make payments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the following years, Cannarozzi seems to have kept his gambling under control, and he built up ownership interests in two restaurants (with Marullo as his counsel). When the opportunity arose in March 1996 for Cannarozzi to acquire an additional restaurant interest for $30,000, he actually returned to Fiumara &#8212; on Marullo's recommendation &#8212; to ask for financing. Fiumara agreed to loan Cannarozzi the $30,000, and the two executed two $15,000 promissory notes, drafted by Marullo, and dated April 15, 1996 and June 10, 1996. The funds on the first note were tendered on April 15, 1996, and Marullo notified the Massachusetts Attorney General of the loan on April 16, 1996.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the end of the year, Cannarozzi was back to losing money gambling and borrowed an additional $30,000 from Fiumara in December 1996. A December 1, 1996 note recorded this loan; on December 3rd Marullo sent notification to the Attorney General.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the next two years, Cannarozzi paid Fiumara over $200,000. Cannarozzi met with Marullo and Fiumara in December 1997 and asserted that his 1996 loans, which totaled $60,000, should have been fully paid by that time. Cannarozzi was told that his payments had only covered the interest, and Fiumara and Marullo discussed Fiumara's business partner who had been found executed in an automobile trunk with unpaid debts to Whitey Bulger.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to Cannarozzi's request, Marullo drafted a note dated December 10, 1997 for $450,000 to pay his outstanding obligations to Fiumara. Cannarozzi signed this note requiring weekly payments of $1,000, secured by a mortgage on the property of the Sierra's Restaurant (\"Sierra's\") in Sudbury, Massachusetts, a commercial interest owned by Cannarozzi. Notice of the loan was delivered to the Attorney General on December 16, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A new note dated April 24, 1998 for $550,000 extinguished the $450,000 December 1997 note and all prior obligations. It was a non-interest loan requiring $1,000 weekly payments, also secured by Sierra's. Marullo sent notice to the Attorney General the same day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The last promissory note signed by Cannarozzi and Fiumara, also a non-interest loan requiring $1,000 weekly payments, was dated August 1, 1998 for the amount of $1,000,000 and extinguished the previous note.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cannarozzi brought suit in January 2000 alleging a number of counts under RICO and Massachusetts state law against Fiumara and several other defendants. The district court dismissed all claims against the other defendants and several claims against Fiumara. Fiumara subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment which the district court granted in full dismissing the remaining RICO and state law claims against Fiumara. Cannarozzi appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Collection of an Unlawful Debt</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">In Section 1962(b), RICO provides that:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It shall be unlawful for any person through a pattern of racketeering activity or through collection of an unlawful debt to acquire or maintain, directly or indirectly, any interest in or control of any enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> Cannarozzi's complaint alleges that Fiumara violated RICO by acquiring an interest in Cannarozzi's commercial enterprise, Sierra's, as collateral on debts to Fiumara. To fall within the reach of the statute (and Congress's power to legislate), Sierra's must affect interstate or foreign commerce. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1962(b); <i>see United States v. Lopez,</i> 514 U.S. 549, 556-59, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995) (discussing limits of Commerce Clause power). Fiumara has not challenged this characterization. <i>See, e.g., Katzenbach v. McClung,</i> 379 U.S. 294, 300, 85 S.Ct. 377, 13 L.Ed.2d 290 (1964) (\"one can hardly travel without eating\"). The statute takes a flexible stance on how the interest or control is acquired, and Fiumara does not question that his right to Cannarozzi's property as collateral qualifies as \"acquir[ing] or maintain[ing], directly or indirectly, any interest in or control of....\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1962(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Act prohibits appropriation of such property that comes about either \"through a pattern of racketeering activity or through collection of an unlawful debt.\" <i>Id.</i> On appeal, Cannarozzi does not purport to have raised a genuine issue of fact concerning Fiumara's engagement in a pattern of racketeering activity but rather rests the complaint on Fiumara's alleged collection of an unlawful debt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The three &#167; 1962(b) counts dismissed by the district court correspond to three different loans, each secured by Cannarozzi's interest in Sierra's. In Count 13, Cannarozzi alleges a &#167; 1962(b) violation based on the December 10, 1997 note and mortgage. Count 16 involves the April 24, 1998 note and mortgage, and Count 19 the August 18, 1998 note and mortgage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Cannarozzi relies on the \"collection of an unlawful debt\" prong of &#167; 1962(b), he must create a genuine issue of fact as to the loan's status as \"unlawful.\" RICO defines \"unlawful debt\" in &#167; 1961(6) as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"unlawful debt\" means a debt (A) incurred or contracted in gambling activity which was in violation of the law of the United States, a State or political subdivision thereof, or which is unenforceable under State or Federal law in whole or in part as to principal or interest because of the laws relating to usury, <i>and</i> (B) which was incurred in connection with the business of gambling in violation of the law of the United States, a State or political subdivision thereof, or the business of lending money or a thing of value at a rate usurious under State or Federal law, where the usurious rate is at least twice the enforceable rate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 1961(6) (emphasis supplied); <i>see Sundance Land Corp. v. Cmty. First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n.,</i> 840 F.2d 653, 665 (9th Cir.1988) (applying &#167; 1961(6) definition to interpret &#167; 1962(b)); <i>United States v. Salinas,</i> 564 F.2d 688, 689 (5th Cir.1977)(applying &#167; 1961(6) definition to interpret &#167; 1962(c)). Accordingly, \"to prove that what was collected was an unlawful debt within the meaning of RICO, [Cannarozzi] would have to show that [1] the debt was unenforceable in whole or in part because of state or federal laws relating to usury, [2] the debt was incurred in connection with `the business of lending money ... at a [usurious] rate,' and [3] the usurious rate was at least twice the enforceable rate.\" <i>Durante Bros. &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Flushing Nat'l Bank,</i> 755 F.2d 239, 248 (2d Cir.1985) (quoting 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1961(6)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cannarozzi's claim only survives summary judgment if there is a genuine issue of fact presented by the record as to <i>all three</i> elements. The district court correctly assumed that if the loans in question were enforceable under the Massachusetts criminal usury statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 271, &#167; 49, then Fiumara deserved summary judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The Massachusetts criminal usury statute states in relevant part, in paragraph (a), that,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whoever in exchange for either a loan of money or other property knowingly contracts for, charges, takes or receives, directly or indirectly, interest and expenses the aggregate of which exceeds an amount greater than twenty per centum per annum upon the sum loaned or the equivalent rate for a longer or shorter period, shall be guilty of criminal usury....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 271, &#167; 49(a). In paragraph (d), the statute provides an important exception to criminal liability:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The provisions of paragraph (a) ... shall not apply to any person who notifies the attorney general of his intent to engage in a <i>transaction or transactions</i> which, but for the provisions of this paragraph, would be proscribed under the provisions of paragraph (a) providing any such person maintains records of any such transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 271, &#167; 49(d) (emphasis supplied). The Supreme Judicial Court has explained that \"[w]hile parties may contract for interest in an amount greater than twenty per cent, the Legislature has determined that as a matter of public policy persons who charge more than twenty per cent interest must register with the Attorney General.\" <i>Begelfer v. Najarian,</i> 381 Mass. 177, 409 N.E.2d 167, 172 (1980). The legal &#8212; and factual &#8212; inquiry as to Cannarozzi's three RICO counts becomes relatively straightforward: did Fiumara provide the Attorney General adequate notification for the three loans named in the counts?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's legal conclusions <i>de novo. See Watson v. Deaconess Waltham Hosp.,</i> 298 F.3d 102, 108 (1st Cir.2002). The district court found that \"[t]he record is clear and it is undisputed that notifications to the attorney general were sent by Marullo on 4/16/96, 12/3/96, 10/16/97, and 4/24/98.\" <i>Cannarozzi v. Marullo,</i> Civ. No. 00-10164-REK, at 5 (D.Mass. Feb. 5, 2003). The parties do not dispute this finding, clearly evidenced by the record. The district court recognized that these notification dates did not match each high interest loan disbursed to Cannarozzi and explained that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The wording of the [criminal usury] statute plainly states, however, that the notification applies to the \"intent to engage in transaction or <i>transactions</i>\" and that \"notification shall be valid for a two year period.\" Every loan at issue in this case was made within two years of sending a notification letter to the Attorney General of Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> (emphasis in the original). That reading, that notification is valid for two years for loan transactions during that period, comports with the language of the statute, and Cannarozzi does not argue to the contrary on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, Cannarozzi demurs, contending that while Fiumara may have provided adequate notice as to these three loans, that does not make them enforceable by the terms of the usury statute. Cannarozzi argues on appeal, as he did in opposing summary judgment, as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fiumara asserts the mortgages he obtained on Cannarozzi's commercial real estate dated 12/10/97, 4/24/98, and 9/1/98, were security for loans consisting of \"roll ups of past debt.\" Because the consideration for these mortgages allegedly derived from Fiumara's prior loans to Cannarozzi, plaintiffs argue that if any of said loans were in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 271, &#167; 49, Fiumara's procurement of the mortgages would also be in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1962(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The argument has some moral and policy appeal: a loanshark should not be able to escape criminal liability &#8212; and recover usurious interest payments &#8212; by the artifice of refinancing with notice to the Attorney General. Any successful argument, though, must be directed not to the purposes behind RICO, <i>see United States v.

The result was the signing of a new note, one that for the first time was secured by Cannarozzi's commercial property interest in Sierra's. Cannarozzi's argument would require us to accept that a notification defect on part or all of an existing debt cannot be cured by a refinancing with proper notification. We decline to endorse that interpretation of Massachusetts law, principally because Massachusetts courts have applied to the criminal usury statute \"the ordinary rule of construction that any criminal statute is construed strictly against the Commonwealth.\" <i>Hakim Enters., Inc. v.

We can glean a rationale for this construction from a related area of Massachusetts law, involving the enforceability of compound interest loans that are refinanced:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"We think the term `compound interest', as it is commonly understood, applies to an agreement whereby interest thereafter to accrue automatically bears interest. Such agreements the law has refused to countenance principally for the reason that an improvident debtor is not likely to realize the extent to which the interest will accumulate. Though the term `compound interest' may apply in certain other circumstances, we think it does not apply where interest has already fallen due and has become a debt which, like any other debt, may either be paid in cash or reloaned to the debtor under a new agreement that it shall bear interest. <i>Such an agreement is not a snare which is likely to entrap the unwary, for the borrower cannot fail to realize the exact extent of his obligation.</i>\" <i>Household Fin.

Samuel Cannarozzi sued Peter Fiumara alleging the latter collected from him several \"unlawful debts\" in violation of RICO. Because the loans did not offend the Massachusetts criminal usury statute, the district court correctly concluded the debts were not \"unlawful\" within the meaning of RICO and properly granted Fiumara's motion for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Factual Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Samuel Cannarozzi is an on-again off-again compulsive gambler.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> A series of football gambling losses indebted him to Joey Yerardi in 1988; in a short period the debt reached $22,000, beyond his capacity to deliver the agreed upon weekly payments. Cannarozzi contacted attorney Steven Marullo who referred Cannarozzi to Marullo's client, Peter Fiumara.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Early in 1991, Cannarozzi met with Fiumara at Fiumara's men's nightclub in Revere, Massachusetts. Fiumara proposed to buy out Cannarozzi's debt to Yerardi in exchange for a promise to repay him the sum at 3% per week. Cannarozzi began weekly payments, but stopped when he had repaid $40,000 because of a federal investigation into Yerardi and Fiumara and the advice of a federal prosecutor who told him that \"the book on these individuals is far from closed.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Marullo insisted that Cannarozzi continue to make payments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the following years, Cannarozzi seems to have kept his gambling under control, and he built up ownership interests in two restaurants (with Marullo as his counsel). When the opportunity arose in March 1996 for Cannarozzi to acquire an additional restaurant interest for $30,000, he actually returned to Fiumara &#8212; on Marullo's recommendation &#8212; to ask for financing. Fiumara agreed to loan Cannarozzi the $30,000, and the two executed two $15,000 promissory notes, drafted by Marullo, and dated April 15, 1996 and June 10, 1996. The funds on the first note were tendered on April 15, 1996, and Marullo notified the Massachusetts Attorney General of the loan on April 16, 1996.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the end of the year, Cannarozzi was back to losing money gambling and borrowed an additional $30,000 from Fiumara in December 1996. A December 1, 1996 note recorded this loan; on December 3rd Marullo sent notification to the Attorney General.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the next two years, Cannarozzi paid Fiumara over $200,000. Cannarozzi met with Marullo and Fiumara in December 1997 and asserted that his 1996 loans, which totaled $60,000, should have been fully paid by that time. Cannarozzi was told that his payments had only covered the interest, and Fiumara and Marullo discussed Fiumara's business partner who had been found executed in an automobile trunk with unpaid debts to Whitey Bulger.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to Cannarozzi's request, Marullo drafted a note dated December 10, 1997 for $450,000 to pay his outstanding obligations to Fiumara. Cannarozzi signed this note requiring weekly payments of $1,000, secured by a mortgage on the property of the Sierra's Restaurant (\"Sierra's\") in Sudbury, Massachusetts, a commercial interest owned by Cannarozzi. Notice of the loan was delivered to the Attorney General on December 16, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A new note dated April 24, 1998 for $550,000 extinguished the $450,000 December 1997 note and all prior obligations. It was a non-interest loan requiring $1,000 weekly payments, also secured by Sierra's.

Fiumara subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment which the district court granted in full dismissing the remaining RICO and state law claims against Fiumara. Cannarozzi appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Collection of an Unlawful Debt</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">In Section 1962(b), RICO provides that:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It shall be unlawful for any person through a pattern of racketeering activity or through collection of an unlawful debt to acquire or maintain, directly or indirectly, any interest in or control of any enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> Cannarozzi's complaint alleges that Fiumara violated RICO by acquiring an interest in Cannarozzi's commercial enterprise, Sierra's, as collateral on debts to Fiumara.

The Supreme Judicial Court has explained that \"[w]hile parties may contract for interest in an amount greater than twenty per cent, the Legislature has determined that as a matter of public policy persons who charge more than twenty per cent interest must register with the Attorney General.\" <i>Begelfer v.

The legal &#8212; and factual &#8212; inquiry as to Cannarozzi's three RICO counts becomes relatively straightforward: did Fiumara provide the Attorney General adequate notification for the three loans named in the counts?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's legal conclusions <i>de novo. See Watson v. Deaconess Waltham Hosp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200110\"><a href=\"/opinion/200110/watson-v-deaconess-waltham/\"><span class=\"volume\">298</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">102</span></a></span>, 108 (1st Cir.2002). The district court found that \"[t]he record is clear and it is undisputed that notifications to the attorney general were sent by Marullo on 4/16/96, 12/3/96, 10/16/97, and 4/24/98.\" <i>Cannarozzi v. Marullo,</i> Civ. No. 00-10164-REK, at 5 (D.Mass. Feb. 5, 2003). The parties do not dispute this finding, clearly evidenced by the record. The district court recognized that these notification dates did not match each high interest loan disbursed to Cannarozzi and explained that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The wording of the [criminal usury] statute plainly states, however, that the notification applies to the \"intent to engage in transaction or <i>transactions</i>\" and that \"notification shall be valid for a two year period.\" Every loan at issue in this case was made within two years of sending a notification letter to the Attorney General of Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> (emphasis in the original). That reading, that notification is valid for two years for loan transactions during that period, comports with the language of the statute, and Cannarozzi does not argue to the contrary on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, Cannarozzi demurs, contending that while Fiumara may have provided adequate notice as to these three loans, that does not make them enforceable by the terms of the usury statute. Cannarozzi argues on appeal, as he did in opposing summary judgment, as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fiumara asserts the mortgages he obtained on Cannarozzi's commercial real estate dated 12/10/97, 4/24/98, and 9/1/98, were security for loans consisting of \"roll ups of past debt.\" Because the consideration for these mortgages allegedly derived from Fiumara's prior loans to Cannarozzi, plaintiffs argue that if any of said loans were in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 271, &#167; 49, Fiumara's procurement of the mortgages would also be in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1962(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The argument has some moral and policy appeal: a loanshark should not be able to escape criminal liability &#8212; and recover usurious interest payments &#8212; by the artifice of refinancing with notice to the Attorney General. Any successful argument, though, must be directed not to the purposes behind RICO, <i>see United States v. Oreto,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"679957\"><a href=\"/opinion/679957/united-states-v-frank-oreto-sr-united-states-of-america-v-frank-oreto/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">739</span></a></span>, 751 (1st Cir.1994) (\"Congress declared in RICO that the statutory purpose was `to seek the eradication of organized crime in the United States' and Congress listed `loan sharking' as a means by which `organized crime derives much of its power.'\") (quoting Pub.L. 91-452, &#167; 1 (Statement of Findings and Purpose following 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1961)), but rather to Massachusetts law. <i>See Salinas,</i> 564 F.2d at 691 (dispositive inquiry is \"whether the particular State involved prohibits the ... activity charged\") (quoting <i>United States v.

Cannarozzi provides no authority for the proposition that Massachusetts courts would refuse to enforce the loans in dispute under the criminal usury statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Looking closely at Cannarozzi's argument in the context of the first of these three loans, issued on December 10, 1997, it becomes apparent that the court below did not err in concluding that the loans did not violate the Massachusetts criminal usury statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> In December 1997, Cannarozzi went to see Fiumara because he could not handle his debt load. The result was the signing of a new note, one that for the first time was secured by Cannarozzi's commercial property interest in Sierra's. Cannarozzi's argument would require us to accept that a notification defect on part or all of an existing debt cannot be cured by a refinancing with proper notification. We decline to endorse that interpretation of Massachusetts law, principally because Massachusetts courts have applied to the criminal usury statute \"the ordinary rule of construction that any criminal statute is construed strictly against the Commonwealth.\" <i>Hakim Enters., Inc. v.

We can glean a rationale for this construction from a related area of Massachusetts law, involving the enforceability of compound interest loans that are refinanced:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"We think the term `compound interest', as it is commonly understood, applies to an agreement whereby interest thereafter to accrue automatically bears interest. Such agreements the law has refused to countenance principally for the reason that an improvident debtor is not likely to realize the extent to which the interest will accumulate. Though the term `compound interest' may apply in certain other circumstances, we think it does not apply where interest has already fallen due and has become a debt which, like any other debt, may either be paid in cash or reloaned to the debtor under a new agreement that it shall bear interest. <i>Such an agreement is not a snare which is likely to entrap the unwary, for the borrower cannot fail to realize the exact extent of his obligation.</i>\" <i>Household Fin.

Similarly, Cannarozzi had the opportunity before signing the new note to realize the magnitude to which his arrearage had escalated. Were his debts then unenforceable under state law, Cannarozzi would have had recourse in state court <i>under the existing note.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cannarozzi has presented us with no more than a remote possibility, without precedential support, that Massachusetts courts would refuse to enforce a note which refinanced usurious debts. Because \"[a]ny reasonable doubt as to the meaning of a criminal statute must be resolved in favor of a defendant,\" <i>Clean Harbors,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">616224</span></span>, at *4, 2004 Mass.Super.

According to the supplemental jurisdiction statute, \"district courts may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction\" when \"the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367(c). The district court had dismissed \"all claims over which it ha[d] original jurisdiction,\" and the district court acted within its discretion in declining to exercise jurisdiction over Cannarozzi's state law claims. <i>See Rodriguez v.
