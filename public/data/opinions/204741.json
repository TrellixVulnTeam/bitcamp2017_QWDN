Plaintiff Ruth Rivera-Colón (“Rivera”)\n\nappeals from the judgment of the United States District Court for\n\nthe District of Puerto Rico, dismissing her claims against her\n\nemployer, the United States Small Business Administration (“SBA”).\n\nRivera alleged that the SBA violated Title VII, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e-\n\n2000e-17 by retaliating against her for her complaints about gender\n\ndiscrimination and sexual harassment in the agency.              The district\n\ncourt granted summary judgment to the defendant.              We affirm.\n\n\n\n                                BACKGROUND\n\nI. Rivera’s Suspension\n\n     We view the facts in the light most favorable to the party\n\nopposing summary judgment. See, e.g., Rosario v. Dep’t of Army, 607\n\nF.3d 241, 242 (1st Cir. 2010).         Rivera began working in the SBA’s\n\nDisaster Program in Puerto Rico in 1989.             By 2002, Rivera became\n\nengaged in a series of disputes with Ivan Irizarry, District\n\nDirector of her region, and Efrain Pardo, Deputy District Director.\n\nOn June 21, 2002, Rivera had a disagreement with Pardo over whether\n\nshe had properly requested time off from work.                On September 3,\n\n2002,   Pardo   reprimanded    her    for     contacting   SBA   personnel   in\n\nWashington regarding concerns she had about a training course\n\nwithout   first   bringing    the    matter    to   Pardo’s   attention.     On\n\nSeptember 17, 2002, Rivera filed an internal complaint against\n\nPardo alleging a variety of grievances.\n\n\n                                     - 3 -\n\f     In November 2002, Rivera submitted an anonymous administrative\n\ncomplaint against Pardo and Irizarry, alleging that they practiced\n\nsexual   harassment   and   gender   discrimination.   Her   anonymous\n\ncomplaint charged that these senior managers were demanding sexual\n\nfavors from female employees and favoring those who were compliant.\n\nAn ad hoc committee determined that the complaint lacked merit, and\n\nRivera then withdrew it.\n\n     On February 20, 2003, Pardo witnessed Rivera questioning the\n\nqualifications of presenters at a training session on telecommuting\n\nin a hostile and, in his assessment, unprofessional manner. An SBA\n\nattorney sent Pardo a memo expressing concern over Rivera’s conduct\n\nat the session.   In addition, union representatives also reported\n\nemployee complaints about Rivera’s attempts to dissuade employees\n\nfrom participating in the telecommuting program.\n\n     On March 25, 2003, Pardo proposed that Rivera receive a two-\n\nday suspension as punishment for her unprofessional conduct at the\n\ntraining session.     On April 3, 2003, Rivera submitted a written\n\nresponse.   She offered no evidence that might refute the charges,\n\nbut stated that she disagreed with the suspension and suspected\n\nthat it was discriminatory.     On April 24, 2003, Irizarry imposed\n\nthe suspension.\n\n     Rivera testified that on May 20, 2003, she was told by a co-\n\nworker that it was widely known throughout the office that it was\n\nshe who had anonymously accused Pardo and Irizzary of sexual\n\n\n                                 - 4 -\n\fharassment and that the coworker believed her suspension was\n\ndiscriminatory.      In support of summary judgment, the SBA submitted\n\nevidence    that,    prior    to   May    20,    2003   (which      was   after   the\n\nimposition of the suspension), the supervisors who imposed the\n\nsuspension were not aware that Rivera submitted a complaint against\n\nthem.   Accordingly, the SBA asserted that her anonymous complaint\n\ncannot have been the cause of her suspension.                 Rivera acknowledged\n\nthat she did “not know the exact date Pardo and Irizarry were made\n\naware of her previous informal sexual harassment complaint, but has\n\nreason to believe they were aware of it prior to her suspension,\n\nsince there were copies of the complaint circulating around the\n\noffice.” Rivera acknowledged that she did not “know for sure” that\n\nIrizarry and Pardo had learned about her complaint prior to May 20,\n\n2003.\n\nII. Rivera’s Reassignment and Termination\n\n     On September 9, 2003, the SBA entered into a memorandum of\n\nunderstanding with the American Federation of Government Employees\n\n(“AFGE”) to transfer SBA employees nationwide who spent more than\n\n25 percent of their time on “liquidation functions” to a facility\n\nin Herndon, VA.      Rivera had previously reported in a survey that\n\nshe spent 35 percent of her time on liquidation, which put her\n\nabove the 25 percent threshold for transfer to Herndon.                            On\n\nSeptember   10,     2003,    the   SBA    sent   a   letter    to   170   employees\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 5 -\n\fincluding Rivera offering “separation incentives” if they decided\n\nagainst relocating to Herndon.\n\n      On December 1, 2003, Monika Harrison, the SBA’s Chief Human\n\nCapital Officer, sent Rivera a notice requesting that she either\n\naccept or decline the reassignment to Herndon within 15 days.\n\nRivera did not accept the reassignment within the time specified,\n\nwhereupon the SBA sent her another letter establishing a new\n\nresponse deadline of January 5, 2004.            Rivera was instructed to\n\nrespond to John Whitmore, a counselor to the SBA Administrator. On\n\nthe January 5, 2004 deadline, Rivera wrote to Whitmore requesting\n\nan   exemption   from   the   transfer   based   on   health   and   personal\n\nconcerns.   Whitmore replied on the following day that he could not\n\ngrant this request, and that Rivera would be terminated on January\n\n24, 2004 due to her failure to accept the transfer.\n\nIII. Rivera’s Complaint\n\n      Rivera brought this action against the SBA in May 2006.            The\n\nsuit alleged that the SBA had discriminated on the basis of gender\n\nin suspending her in May 2003 and in terminating her in January\n\n2004. The suit also claimed that her suspension, reassignment, and\n\ntermination were in retaliation for her anonymous complaint of\n\nsexual harassment.      She demanded reinstatement to her position,\n\ncompensatory damages, punitive damages, and attorney’s fees and\n\ncosts.   The district court granted summary judgment dismissing all\n\n\n\n\n                                   - 6 -\n\fher   claims.   Rivera   appeals    only     from   the   dismissal   of   her\n\nretaliation claims.\n\n\n\n                             DISCUSSION\n\nI. Standard of Review\n\n      We review the district court’s grant of summary judgment de\n\nnovo. Barton v. Clancy, No. 08-2479, 2010 WL 117261, at *6 (1st\n\nCir. Jan. 14, 2011). Rivera’s retaliation claims arise under Title\n\nVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3 (2006).\n\nTo justify summary judgment, the moving party must show entitlement\n\nto judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56a(c)(2) (“The\n\njudgment sought should be rendered if . . . there is no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law.”).1           If the moving party initially\n\nmeets this burden, the opposing party can then defeat the motion by\n\nshowing that there is a genuine issue of material fact. Id.                In\n\nevaluating whether there is a genuine issue of material fact, the\n\ncourt examines the record - pleadings, affidavits, depositions,\n\nadmissions, and answers to interrogatories - viewing the evidence\n\nin the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment.\n\nSee Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 150\n\n(2000); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323-24 (1986).\n\n\n      1\n       Citations to Rule 56 refer to the version that was in\neffect at the time of the judgment and not to the revision of\nDecember 1, 2010.\n\n                                   - 7 -\n\fUnsupported allegations and speculation do not demonstrate either\n\nentitlement to summary judgment or the existence of a genuine issue\n\nof   material    fact   sufficient   to   defeat    summary     judgment.   See\n\nFeliciano de la Cruz v. El Conquistador Resort & Country Club, 218\n\nF.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2000); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(1) (“A\n\nsupporting      or   opposing   affidavit    must   be   made    on   personal\n\nknowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and\n\nshow that the affiant is competent to testify on the matters\n\nstated.”).\n\nII. Retaliation Claims\n\nA. Suspension as Retaliation\n\n      Under Title VII’s anti-retaliation provisions, a plaintiff\n\nmust plead a prima facie case consisting of three elements: that\n\nthe plaintiff engaged in an activity that is protected by the\n\nstatute; that the plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action;\n\nand a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse\n\nemployment action. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3; Gu v. Boston Police\n\nDep’t, 312 F.3d 6, 14 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n      The defendant can support a motion for summary judgment by\n\nshowing that the adverse employment action was taken for a non-\n\nretaliatory reason.        See Collazo v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Mfg.,\n\nInc., 617 F.3d 39, 46 (1st Cir. 2010).        In such case, the plaintiff\n\ncan defeat summary judgment by showing evidence sufficient to raise\n\n\n\n\n                                     - 8 -\n\fa material issue of fact as to whether retaliation was in fact a\n\ncause of the adverse action.\n\n     The defendant made a showing that Rivera’s suspension cannot\n\nhave been motivated by retaliation for Rivera’s anonymous complaint\n\nbecause she was suspended before the supervisors who imposed the\n\nsuspension learned she was the source of the anonymous complaint.\n\n     The district court determined that Rivera failed to raise a\n\nmaterial issue of fact rebutting the defendant’s showing because\n\nshe offered nothing to contradict the defendant’s evidence that\n\nPardo and Irizarry imposed the suspension before learning of the\n\ncomplaint. By Rivera’s own admission, she was uncertain when Pardo\n\nand Irizarry learned that she was the source of the complaint and\n\nhad no evidence that they learned before May 20, 2003.       Given\n\nRivera’s failure to dispute effectively the SBA’s evidence that the\n\nsupervisors were unaware of her complaint when they imposed the\n\nsuspension, the district court correctly determined that Rivera\n\nfailed to raise a genuine issue of material fact.     The district\n\ncourt’s grant of summary judgment as to the suspension was thus\n\nappropriate.\n\nB. Reassignment and Termination as Retaliation\n\n     Rivera further claims that her reassignment to Herndon and her\n\ntermination when she refused the reassignment were in retaliation\n\nfor both her anonymous complaint and a formal charge she filed with\n\nthe EEOC in June 2003.   The SBA, however, showed in support of its\n\n\n                               - 9 -\n\fmotion for summary judgment that the reassignment and termination\n\nwere done under a generally applicable policy that covered large\n\nnumbers of employees.       Rivera failed to submit evidence that could\n\nraise   a   question   of   material   fact   as   to   the   cause   of   her\n\nreassignment and termination.       We conclude that the district court\n\nproperly granted summary judgment.\n\n     We have considered Rivera’s other claims of error and find no\n\nmerit in them.\n\n\n\n                                CONCLUSION\n\n     The district court’s decision is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  - 10 -\n\f",

Clancy, No. 08-2479, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">117261</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *6 (1st\n\nCir. Jan. 14, 2011). Rivera’s retaliation claims arise under Title\n\nVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3 (2006).\n\nTo justify summary judgment, the moving party must show entitlement\n\nto judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56a(c)(2) (“The\n\njudgment sought should be rendered if . . . there is no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law.”).1           If the moving party initially\n\nmeets this burden, the opposing party can then defeat the motion by\n\nshowing that there is a genuine issue of material fact. Id.                In\n\nevaluating whether there is a genuine issue of material fact, the\n\ncourt examines the record - pleadings, affidavits, depositions,\n\nadmissions, and answers to interrogatories - viewing the evidence\n\nin the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment.\n\nSee Reeves v.

R. Civ. P. 56(e)(1) (“A\n\nsupporting      or   opposing   affidavit    must   be   made    on   personal\n\nknowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and\n\nshow that the affiant is competent to testify on the matters\n\nstated.”).\n\nII. Retaliation Claims\n\nA. Suspension as Retaliation\n\n      Under Title VII’s anti-retaliation provisions, a plaintiff\n\nmust plead a prima facie case consisting of three elements: that\n\nthe plaintiff engaged in an activity that is protected by the\n\nstatute; that the plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action;\n\nand a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse\n\nemployment action. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3; Gu v. Boston Police\n\nDep’t, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200231\"><a href=\"/opinion/200231/gu-v-boston-police-dept/\"><span class=\"volume\">312</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 14 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n      The defendant can support a motion for summary judgment by\n\nshowing that the adverse employment action was taken for a non-\n\nretaliatory reason.        See Collazo v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Mfg.,\n\nInc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"152316\"><a href=\"/opinion/152316/collazo-v-bristol-myers-squibb-mfg-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">617</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 46 (1st Cir. 2010).        In such case, the plaintiff\n\ncan defeat summary judgment by showing evidence sufficient to raise\n\n\n\n\n                                     - 8 -\n\fa material issue of fact as to whether retaliation was in fact a\n\ncause of the adverse action.\n\n     The defendant made a showing that Rivera’s suspension cannot\n\nhave been motivated by retaliation for Rivera’s anonymous complaint\n\nbecause she was suspended before the supervisors who imposed the\n\nsuspension learned she was the source of the anonymous complaint.\n\n     The district court determined that Rivera failed to raise a\n\nmaterial issue of fact rebutting the defendant’s showing because\n\nshe offered nothing to contradict the defendant’s evidence that\n\nPardo and Irizarry imposed the suspension before learning of the\n\ncomplaint. By Rivera’s own admission, she was uncertain when Pardo\n\nand Irizarry learned that she was the source of the complaint and\n\nhad no evidence that they learned before May 20, 2003.       Given\n\nRivera’s failure to dispute effectively the SBA’s evidence that the\n\nsupervisors were unaware of her complaint when they imposed the\n\nsuspension, the district court correctly determined that Rivera\n\nfailed to raise a genuine issue of material fact.     The district\n\ncourt’s grant of summary judgment as to the suspension was thus\n\nappropriate.\n\nB. Reassignment and Termination as Retaliation\n\n     Rivera further claims that her reassignment to Herndon and her\n\ntermination when she refused the reassignment were in retaliation\n\nfor both her anonymous complaint and a formal charge she filed with\n\nthe EEOC in June 2003.   The SBA, however, showed in support of its\n\n\n                               - 9 -\n\fmotion for summary judgment that the reassignment and termination\n\nwere done under a generally applicable policy that covered large\n\nnumbers of employees.       Rivera failed to submit evidence that could\n\nraise   a   question   of   material   fact   as   to   the   cause   of   her\n\nreassignment and termination.       We conclude that the district court\n\nproperly granted summary judgment.\n\n     We have considered Rivera’s other claims of error and find no\n\nmerit in them.\n\n\n\n                                CONCLUSION\n\n     The district court’s decision is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  - 10 -\n\f</pre>",
