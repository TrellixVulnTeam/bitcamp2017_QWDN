TRIPP,\n\n                      Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                               v.\n\n                   SCOTT COLE; TOWN OF BETHEL,\n\n                     Defendants, Appellees.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF MAINE\n\n          [Hon. George Z. Singal, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n           Torruella, Lynch, and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Stephen C. Chute, with whom Carey & Associates P.A. was on\nbrief, for appellant.\n     Anne M. Carney, with whom Norman, Hanson & Detroy, LLC was on\nbrief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n                       September 27, 2005\n\f           LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.       The events that generated this\n\ncase began with a \"dog at large\" in Bethel, Maine and ended with\n\nthe termination of the town's chief of police.     As a result of the\n\ninvestigation and prosecution of the dog at large incident, a\n\ndisagreement arose between the police chief, plaintiff-appellant\n\nDarren Tripp, and the town manager, defendant-appellee Scott Cole.\n\nCole wanted Tripp to intercede with the district attorney on behalf\n\nof the dog owner; Tripp expressed his discomfort with the request.\n\nFour months later, citing various issues unrelated to the dog at\n\nlarge incident, Cole suspended Tripp for a month; he later fired\n\nhim.   Tripp then sued Cole and the Town of Bethel, claiming that he\n\nhad been retaliated against for speech protected under the First\n\nAmendment and state law.      The district court granted summary\n\njudgment for defendants.   We affirm.\n\n                                 I.\n\nA.         Facts\n\n           We recite the facts in the light most favorable to the\n\nnon-movant, Tripp, and draw all reasonable inferences in his favor.\n\nSmith v. Robertshaw Controls Co., 410 F.3d 29, 31 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           In October 2002, Chief Tripp observed a dog at large and\n\ncalled the town's animal control officer.      According to witnesses\n\n(including the town engineer), the animal control officer pursued\n\nthe dog into the owner's garage and captured it there, when,\n\n\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\farguably, it was no longer a dog at large.        A summons was issued to\n\nthe dog's owner, Sherry Thurston.\n\n             Thurston repeatedly called Cole to complain about the\n\nsummons.     Eventually (after checking with the town engineer), Cole\n\nasked Tripp to dismiss the summons.       Tripp -- who surreptitiously\n\nrecorded the conversation -- responded that the matter was now in\n\nthe district attorney's hands.       Cole then asked Tripp to ask the\n\ndistrict attorney to \"dump\" the summons, and insisted on Tripp's\n\nword that he would do so.      Tripp responded, \"I can ask the DA what\n\nhe wants to do, but when it comes this far, you know I'm not\n\ncomfortable doing this.\"\n\n             At   Thurston's   arraignment   in   November   2002,   Tripp\n\ndutifully passed along Cole's request to the assistant district\n\nattorney (ADA).1     That same day, Cole e-mailed Tripp to ask whether\n\nhe had asked the ADA to dismiss the case.          Tripp went to Cole's\n\noffice and told him that he had relayed Cole's request, although\n\nCole testified at his deposition that he had no idea whether or not\n\nTripp had relayed the request.       The record is unclear as to what\n\nultimately happened with the summons.\n\n             At some point that winter, Tripp spoke to two Bethel\n\nselectmen and noted that his relationship with Cole had \"cooled,\"\n\ndue, in his opinion, to the Thurston summons issue.          The selectmen\n\n\n\n\n     1\n         The record does not reveal the ADA's response.\n\n                                    -3-\n\fagreed, although without a particular basis for personal knowledge\n\ndisclosed by the record.\n\n          In March 2003, Cole gave Tripp a written notice of a one-\n\nmonth suspension from duty with pay.   The notice listed a variety\n\nof alleged misdeeds by Tripp, some of which were two years old,\n\nmost of which had never been mentioned to Tripp before, and none of\n\nwhich had ever been noted in his personnel file.    Tripp conceded\n\nthat some, though not all, were true.     His suspension ended in\n\nApril 2003, and he returned to duty.\n\n          In January 2004, Cole gave Tripp a document describing\n\nTripp's failure to respond to an armed robbery call in December\n\n2003.   The incident was investigated over the next month.      In\n\nFebruary 2004, Tripp was terminated from his job for cause.     He\n\nappealed to the Board of Selectmen, which upheld the termination by\n\na 3-2 vote.\n\nB.        Procedural history\n\n          Tripp sued Cole and the Town, alleging a claim under 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983 and three claims under state law.     Tripp does not\n\nappeal the disposition of two of the state law claims and we do not\n\ndiscuss them.    The claims    at issue in this appeal are that\n\ndefendants retaliated against Tripp for (1) speech protected by the\n\nFirst Amendment, in violation of § 1983 (Count I), and for (2)\n\nreporting a violation of Maine law, in violation of the Maine Human\n\nRights Act (MHRA), Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 5, §§ 4551-4634, and\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fthe Maine Whistleblowers' Protection Act (MWPA), Me. Rev. Stat.\n\nAnn. tit. 26, §§ 831-840 (Count III).2           The case was referred to a\n\nmagistrate judge, and the parties cross-moved for summary judgment.\n\n                 The magistrate judge recommended summary judgment for\n\ndefendants on both claims.            Tripp v. Cole, No. 03-289, 2004 U.S.\n\nDist. LEXIS 25124 (D. Me. Sept. 24, 2004) (\"Tripp I\").                      The\n\nmagistrate judge evaluated the MHRA/MWPA claim first, on the theory\n\nthat \"'[w]hen balancing the rights of the employee against those of\n\nthe employer, an employee's First Amendment interest is entitled to\n\ngreater weight where he is acting as a whistle-blower in exposing\n\ngovernment corruption.'\"          Id. at *12 (quoting Guilloty Perez v.\n\nPierluisi, 339 F.3d 43, 53 (1st Cir. 2003)).             The magistrate judge\n\nfound that a reasonable person in Tripp's position would not have\n\nbelieved Cole's request was illegal, and furthermore Tripp never\n\nactually reported a violation.           On the First Amendment claim, the\n\nmagistrate judge found that the speech at issue did not address a\n\nmatter      of    public   concern.     The   district   court   reviewed   the\n\nmagistrate's report and recommendation de novo and adopted it in\n\nfull.       Tripp v. Cole, No. 03-289, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20740 (D.\n\nMe. Oct. 13, 2004).         This appeal followed.\n\n\n\n\n        2\n      The MWPA prohibits discrimination against employees because\nof whistleblowing activities, but the MHRA provides the individual\ncause of action for an MWPA violation. See infra note 4.\n\n                                        -5-\n\f                                    II.\n\n              Passing over two issues that require little discussion,3\n\nwe discern two main arguments in Tripp's appeal.             First, he argues\n\nthat the court wrongly held that his conduct was not protected by\n\nthe MWPA.       Tripp asserts that Cole's request was an unlawful\n\nobstruction of government administration which Tripp reported to\n\nCole himself and to two Bethel selectmen.             Second, Tripp argues\n\nthat the court wrongly held that his speech was not protected by\n\nthe First Amendment because it did not involve a matter of public\n\nconcern.      He argues that his speech involved the important public\n\nissue of the legality and propriety of town officials interceding\n\non   behalf    of   affluent   citizens   to   give   them   more   favorable\n\ntreatment in court.        We review the district court's grant of\n\nsummary judgment de novo.       Smith, 410 F.3d at 34.\n\n\n\n      3\n      First, Tripp claims that the magistrate judge erred in\nstriking his post-discovery affidavit on the grounds that it\ncontradicted his deposition testimony.      The magistrate judge\ngranted the motion to strike but expressly stated that the summary\njudgment ruling did not depend on this evidentiary ruling because\nit resolved the case on legal grounds for which the evidentiary\ndispute was irrelevant.     We follow a similar path, assuming\narguendo that the affidavit is part of the evidentiary record.\n     Second, Tripp claims that defendants denied him due process,\nand therefore the court should have (1) excluded defendants'\nevidence of reasons for his suspension and termination, and (2)\ngranted partial summary judgment declaring that the reason for the\nadverse action was retaliation. We read this argument charitably\nto say that, because defendants did not give Tripp a proper\nopportunity to respond to the allegations against him, they should\nnot be permitted to rely on those allegations to justify his\ntermination. Because Tripp did not plead a due process claim in\nhis complaint, he has forfeited any such argument.\n\n                                    -6-\n\fA.        Whistleblower Retaliation\n\n          Under the MWPA, \"[n]o employer may discharge . . . or\n\notherwise discriminate against an employee . . . because[] [t]he\n\nemployee, acting in good faith, . . . reports orally or in writing\n\nto the employer or a public body what the employee has reasonable\n\ncause to believe is a violation of a law.\"        Me. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n\ntit. 26, § 833(1)(A).4      \"[A] prima facie case of reprisal for\n\nwhistleblowing requires that the employee show that (1) he engaged\n\nin activity protected by the statute, (2) he was the subject of\n\nadverse employment action, and (3) there was a causal link between\n\nthe protected activity and the adverse employment action.\"             Bard\n\nv. Bath Iron Works Corp., 590 A.2d 152, 154 (Me. 1991).\n\n          Under   the   MWPA,   the   complained-of   conduct   need    not\n\nactually be illegal, but the employee must \"prove that a reasonable\n\nperson might have believed\" that it was.         Id. at 155; see also\n\nHiggins v. New Balance Athletic Shoe, Inc., 194 F.3d 252, 262 (1st\n\nCir. 1999) (explaining that \"an employee's reasonable belief that\n\n[the conduct] crosses the line suffices\").       Tripp argues that it\n\nwas reasonable to believe that Cole's request to ask the prosecutor\n\nto \"dump\" the Thurston summons was a violation of Me. Rev. Stat.\n\nAnn. tit. 17-A, § 751(1), under which \"[a] person is guilty of\n\n\n\n     4\n      Although the MWPA itself provides no private right of action,\ncomplainants may, after appropriate administrative process, file a\ncivil action under the MHRA. See Schlear v. Fiber Materials, Inc.,\n574 A.2d 876, 878-79 (Me. 1990).\n\n                                  -7-\n\fobstructing government administration if the person intentionally\n\ninterferes by force, violence or intimidation or by any physical\n\nact with a public servant performing . . . an official function.\"\n\nIn Tripp's view, Cole attempted to interfere by intimidating Tripp\n\ninto seeking the termination of an ongoing criminal proceeding;\n\nTripp informed Cole and two selectmen that such a request was\n\nillegal; and he was suspended (and eventually fired) as a result.\n\n              The district court found that Tripp had not engaged in\n\nprotected activity for two independent reasons: (1) a reasonable\n\nperson      would   not   have   considered   Cole's    request   to   be   an\n\nobstruction of government administration, and (2) Tripp never\n\nreported to anyone his alleged belief that Cole's request was\n\nillegal.      See Tripp I, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25124 at *15-16.           We\n\nfind the first ground adequate to sustain the judgment, and do not\n\naddress the second.\n\n              Although the language of § 751 could theoretically apply\n\nto a broad range of conduct, Maine courts have construed the\n\nprovision narrowly.        In particular, we have not found, and Tripp\n\nhas not cited, any Maine case where a government official was\n\nprosecuted under § 751 for an order to a subordinate employee.              To\n\nthe contrary, in virtually all of the reported cases under § 751\n\nand   its    predecessor    common   law    doctrine,   the   defendant     had\n\nattempted to prevent a law enforcement officer from effecting a\n\nsearch or arrest.         Therefore, if we accepted Tripp's theory, he\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fwould be the first victim of that particular form of obstructing\n\ngovernment administration in over 100 years of reported Maine\n\ncases.   To be sure, the words of the statute do not foreclose the\n\npossibility that § 751 could apply to a public official's order to\n\na subordinate.    But \"[i]f we are unwilling to stretch state\n\nprecedents to reach new frontiers, a litigant like [Tripp], who\n\ndeliberately chose to reject a state-court forum in favor of a\n\nfederal forum . . . is in a perilously poor position to grumble\n\nabout our stodginess.\"   Porter v. Nutter, 913 F.2d 37, 41 (1st Cir.\n\n1990) (quotation marks omitted).\n\n          Second, even if it were possible that a town manager's\n\norder to a chief of police to ask prosecutors to dismiss a summons\n\ncould constitute \"intentionally interfer[ing] . . . with a public\n\nservant performing . . . an official function,\" Cole's request did\n\nnot -- and could not have been reasonably believed to -- qualify as\n\n\"intimidation\"   under   §   751.5     Maine   courts   have   defined\n\n\"intimidation\" in this context as \"unlawful coercion, extortion,\n\nduress, or putting in fear.\"    State v. Matson, 818 A.2d 213, 215\n\n(Me. 2003) (quotation marks omitted). Tripp cites Cole's statement\n\nthat \"I made my request and I'm expecting it to be honored.\"\n\nViewed in the light most favorable to Tripp, this statement might\n\nsound like a vaguely worded threat to his continued employment with\n\n\n\n     5\n      Tripp does not claim that Cole interfered           by   \"force,\nviolence, or . . . physical act,\" id. § 751(1).\n\n                                 -9-\n\fthe Town.   But Maine courts have interpreted § 751 to require much\n\nmore than vaguely worded threats.      See Matson, 818 A.2d at 214-15\n\n(vacating § 751 conviction where defendant physically interfered\n\nwith police officer's arrest of another person, but did not strike\n\nofficer, threaten him, or call him names, because such conduct was\n\nnot \"intimidation\"); State v. Janisczak, 579 A.2d 736, 738 (Me.\n\n1990) (vacating § 751 conviction where defendant had yelled and\n\ncursed at officers as they struggled with a large, violent suspect,\n\nbecause such conduct was not \"intimidation\"). Accordingly, summary\n\njudgment was proper on the MWPA claim.\n\nB.          First Amendment\n\n            According to Tripp, Cole and the Town retaliated against\n\nhim for speech protected by the First Amendment, namely (1) his\n\nconversation with Cole, and (2) his remark to two selectmen that\n\nhis relationship with Cole had \"cooled\" as a result of the Thurston\n\nsummons incident.\n\n            In assessing a public employee's claim of workplace\n\nretaliation for speech, we apply a three-part test: \"(1) whether\n\nthe speech involves a matter of public concern; (2) whether, when\n\nbalanced against each other, the First Amendment interests of the\n\nplaintiff and the public outweigh the government's interest in\n\nfunctioning efficiently; and (3) whether the protected speech was\n\na substantial or motivating factor in the adverse action against\n\nthe plaintiff.\"   Mihos v. Swift, 358 F.3d 91, 102 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n\n                                -10-\n\fThe district court determined that Tripp's speech at issue did not\n\ninvolve a matter of public concern.          We review that decision de\n\nnovo.   O'Connor v. Steeves, 994 F.2d 905, 912 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n           \"Whether an employee's speech addresses a matter of\n\npublic concern must be determined by the content, form, and context\n\nof a given statement, as revealed by the whole record.\"         Connick v.\n\nMyers, 461 U.S. 138, 147-48 (1983).          In some cases the content\n\nalone establishes the public nature of the matter; in others the\n\nform and context make it so:\n\n           Where a public employee speaks out on a topic\n           which is clearly a legitimate matter of\n           inherent concern to the electorate, the court\n           may eschew further inquiry into the employee's\n           motives as revealed by the 'form and context'\n           of the expression.       On the other hand,\n           public-employee speech on a topic which would\n           not necessarily qualify, on the basis of its\n           content alone, as a matter of inherent public\n           concern (e.g., internal working conditions,\n           affecting only the speaker and co-workers),\n           may require a more complete Connick analysis\n           into   the    form   and   context    of   the\n           public-employee expression, 'as revealed by\n           the whole record,' with a view to whether the\n           community has in fact manifested a legitimate\n           concern in the internal workings of the\n           particular agency or department of government,\n           and, if so, whether the 'form' of the\n           employee's expression suggests a subjective\n           intent to contribute to any such public\n           discourse.\n\nO'Connor, 994 F.2d at 913-14 (citations and emphases omitted).\n\n           We first address Tripp's statements to the selectmen that\n\nhis   relationship   with   Cole   had   \"cooled.\"    These    are   classic\n\nexamples   of   speech   concerning      \"internal   working   conditions,\n\n                                   -11-\n\faffecting only the speaker and co-workers.\" Id. at 914. Moreover,\n\nthe    record    does   not   reveal    that   \"the   community      has    in   fact\n\nmanifested a legitimate concern in the internal workings\" of the\n\nBethel police department or its interactions with the Town Manager,\n\nnor that \"the 'form' of [Tripp's] expression suggests a subjective\n\nintent to contribute to any such public discourse.\"                 Id.    That ends\n\nthat matter.\n\n               Perhaps recognizing that the disposition of a particular\n\n\"dog at large\" summons is rarely a \"matter of inherent concern to\n\nthe electorate,\" id. at 913-14, Tripp invokes larger themes.                      In\n\nhis view, the public concern of his speech lay in the principle\n\nthat \"[a] citizen from an affluent neighborhood of the community\n\nshould    abide    by   the   same    rules    and   be   subject    to    the   same\n\nconsequences as those from more modest circumstances.\"                    Tripp made\n\na    similar    argument   to   the    magistrate     judge.    As    she    noted,\n\n\"[a]ccording to Tripp, 'there can be no higher public concern than\n\nto    have      justice    evenly      administered       without    the     Town's\n\nadministrators capriciously granting favors to special citizens.'\"\n\nTripp I, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25124 at *18.                   However, as the\n\nmagistrate judge also observed,\"[t]he problem with this argument is\n\nthat it does not identify any 'given statement' by Tripp; it only\n\noffers Tripp's personal opinion as to what Cole's personal motives\n\nwere when he interceded on Ms. Thurston's behalf.\"                         Id.    The\n\nmagistrate judge was correct.            In the absence of any citation to\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\fevidence in the summary judgment record that Tripp explained to\n\nCole his concern about the unequal administration of justice, Tripp\n\ncannot establish that his speech to Cole invoked a matter of public\n\nconcern which led to his retaliatory dismissal.\n\n            Tripp cites only his statement to Cole that he was \"not\n\ncomfortable\" with Cole's request. An opaque statement such as \"I'm\n\nnot comfortable doing this\" is not \"clearly a legitimate matter of\n\ninherent concern to the electorate.\"          Id. (emphases added).      It\n\ncertainly does not invoke the unequal administration of justice\n\nconcern. As stated, the content of Tripp's speech conveyed nothing\n\nmore than his preference not to intercede with the ADA in the\n\nresolution of a particular dog at large summons.\n\n            The \"form and context\" analysis does not assist Tripp\n\neither.    Under O'Connor, speech on internal working conditions may\n\nrise to the level of public concern if \"the community has in fact\n\nmanifested a legitimate concern in the internal workings of the\n\nparticular agency or department of government, and . . . the 'form'\n\nof the employee's expression suggests a subjective intent to\n\ncontribute to any such public discourse.\"         994 F.2d at 914; see,\n\ne.g., Baron v.

As a result of the investigation and prosecution of the dog at large incident, a disagreement arose between the police chief, plaintiff-appellant Darren Tripp, and the town manager, defendant-appellee Scott Cole. Cole wanted Tripp to intercede with the district attorney on behalf of the dog owner; Tripp expressed his discomfort with the request. Four months later, citing various issues unrelated to the dog at large incident, Cole suspended Tripp for a month; he later fired him. Tripp then sued Cole and the Town of Bethel, claiming that he had been retaliated against for speech protected under the First Amendment and state law. The district court granted summary judgment for defendants. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

According to witnesses (including the town engineer), the animal control officer pursued the dog into the owner's garage and captured it there, when, arguably, it was no longer a dog at large. A summons was issued to the dog's owner, Sherry Thurston.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thurston repeatedly called Cole to complain about the summons. Eventually (after checking with the town engineer), Cole asked Tripp to dismiss the summons. Tripp &#8212; who surreptitiously recorded the conversation &#8212; responded that the matter was now in the district attorney's hands. Cole then asked Tripp to ask the district attorney to \"dump\" the summons, and insisted on Tripp's word that he would do so. Tripp responded, \"I can ask the DA what he wants to do, but when it comes this far, you know I'm not comfortable doing this.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At Thurston's arraignment in November 2002, Tripp dutifully passed along Cole's request to the assistant district attorney (ADA).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> That same day, Cole e-mailed Tripp to ask whether he had asked the ADA to dismiss the case. Tripp went to Cole's office and told him that he had relayed Cole's request, although Cole testified at his deposition that he had no idea whether or not Tripp had relayed the request. The record is unclear as to what ultimately happened with the summons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At some point that winter, Tripp spoke to two Bethel selectmen and noted that his relationship with Cole had \"cooled,\" due, in his opinion, to the Thurston summons issue. The selectmen agreed, although without a particular basis for personal knowledge disclosed by the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 2003, Cole gave Tripp a written notice of a one-month suspension from duty with pay. The notice listed a variety of alleged misdeeds by Tripp, some of which were two years old, most of which had never been mentioned to Tripp before, and none of which had ever been noted in his personnel file. Tripp conceded that some, though not all, were true. His suspension ended in April 2003, and he returned to duty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 2004, Cole gave Tripp a document describing Tripp's failure to respond to an armed robbery call in December 2003. The incident was investigated over the next month. In February 2004, Tripp was terminated from his job for cause. He appealed to the Board of Selectmen, which upheld the termination by a 3-2 vote.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Procedural history</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tripp sued Cole and the Town, alleging a claim under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 and three claims under state law. Tripp does not appeal the disposition of two of the state law claims and we do not discuss them. The claims at issue in this appeal are that defendants retaliated against Tripp for (1) speech protected by the First Amendment, in violation of &#167; 1983 (Count I), and for (2) reporting a violation of Maine law, in violation of the Maine Human Rights Act (MHRA), Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 5, &#167;&#167; 4551-4634, and the Maine Whistleblowers' Protection Act (MWPA), Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 26, &#167;&#167; 831-840 (Count III).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The case was referred to a magistrate judge, and the parties cross-moved for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge recommended summary judgment for defendants on both claims. <i>Tripp v. Cole,</i> No. 03-289, 2004 WL 2185840, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25124 (D.Me. Sept. 24, 2004) (\"<i>Tripp I</i>\"). The magistrate judge evaluated the MHRA/MWPA claim first, on the theory that \"`[w]hen balancing the rights of the employee against those of the employer, an employee's First Amendment interest is entitled to greater weight where he is acting as a whistle-blower in exposing government corruption.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 2004 WL 2185840, at *3, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25124, at *12 (quoting <i>Guilloty Perez v. Pierluisi,</i> 339 F.3d 43, 53 (1st Cir.2003)). The magistrate judge found that a reasonable person in Tripp's position would not have believed Cole's request was illegal, and furthermore Tripp never actually reported a violation. On the First Amendment claim, the magistrate judge found that the speech at issue did not address a matter of public concern. The district court reviewed the magistrate's report and recommendation <i>de novo</i> and adopted it in full. <i>Tripp v. Cole,</i> 2004 WL 2326391, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20740 at 15-16 (D.Me.

First, he argues that the court wrongly held that his conduct was not protected by the MWPA. Tripp asserts that Cole's request was an unlawful obstruction of government administration which Tripp reported to Cole himself and to two Bethel selectmen. Second, Tripp argues that the court wrongly held that his speech was not protected by the First Amendment because it did not involve a matter of public concern. He argues that his speech involved the important public issue of the legality and propriety of town officials interceding on behalf of affluent citizens to give them more favorable treatment in court. We review the district court's grant of summary judgment <i>de novo. Smith,</i> 410 F.3d at 34.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Whistleblower Retaliation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the MWPA, \"[n]o employer may discharge . . . or otherwise discriminate against an employee . . . because[ ] [t]he employee, acting in good faith, . . . reports orally or in writing to the employer or a public body what the employee has reasonable cause to believe is a violation of a law.\" Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 26, &#167; 833(1)(A).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> \"[A] prima facie case of reprisal for whistleblowing requires that the employee show that (1) he engaged in activity protected by the statute, (2) he was the subject of adverse employment action, and (3) there was a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.\" <i>Bard v. Bath Iron Works Corp.,</i> 590 A.2d 152, 154 (Me.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the MWPA, the complained-of conduct need not <i>actually</i> be illegal, but the employee must \"prove that a reasonable person might have believed\" that it was. <i>Id.</i> at 155; <i>see also Higgins v. New Balance Athletic Shoe, Inc.,</i> 194 F.3d 252, 262 (1st Cir.1999) (explaining that \"an employee's reasonable belief that [the conduct] crosses the line suffices\"). Tripp argues that it was reasonable to believe that Cole's request to ask the prosecutor to \"dump\" the Thurston summons was a violation of Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &#167; 751(1), under which \"[a] person is guilty of obstructing government administration if the person intentionally interferes by force, violence or intimidation or by any physical act with a public servant performing . . . an official function.\" In Tripp's view, Cole attempted to interfere by intimidating Tripp into seeking the termination of an ongoing criminal proceeding; Tripp informed Cole and two selectmen that such a request was illegal; and he was suspended (and eventually fired) as a result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that Tripp had not engaged in protected activity for two independent reasons: (1) a reasonable person would not have considered Cole's request to be an obstruction of government administration, and (2) Tripp never reported to anyone his alleged belief that Cole's request was illegal. <i>See Tripp I,</i> 2004 WL 2185840, at *3, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25124 at *15-16. We find the first ground adequate to sustain the judgment, and do not address the second.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the language of &#167; 751 could theoretically apply to a broad range of conduct, Maine courts have construed the provision narrowly. In particular, we have not found, and Tripp has not cited, any Maine case where a government official was prosecuted under &#167; 751 for an order to a subordinate employee. To the contrary, in virtually all of the reported cases under &#167; 751 and its predecessor common law doctrine, the defendant had attempted to prevent a law enforcement officer from effecting a search or arrest. Therefore, if we accepted Tripp's theory, he would be the first victim of that particular form of obstructing government administration in over 100 years of reported Maine cases. To be sure, the words of the statute do not foreclose the possibility that &#167; 751 could apply to a public official's order to a subordinate. But \"[i]f we are unwilling to stretch state precedents to reach new frontiers, a litigant like [Tripp], who deliberately chose to reject a state-court forum in favor of a federal forum . . . is in a perilously poor position to grumble about our stodginess.\" <i>Porter v. Nutter,</i> 913 F.2d 37, 41 (1st Cir.1990) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, even if it were possible that a town manager's order to a chief of police to ask prosecutors to dismiss a summons could constitute \"intentionally interfer[ing] . . . with a public servant performing . . . an official function,\" Cole's request did not &#8212; and could not have been reasonably believed to &#8212; qualify as \"intimidation\" under &#167; 751.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Maine courts have defined \"intimidation\" in this context as \"unlawful coercion, extortion, duress, or putting in fear.\" <i>State v. Matson,</i> 818 A.2d 213, 215 (Me.2003) (quotation marks omitted). Tripp cites Cole's statement that \"I made my request and I'm expecting it to be honored.\" Viewed in the light most favorable to Tripp, this statement might sound like a vaguely worded threat to his continued employment with the Town. But Maine courts have interpreted &#167; 751 to require much more than vaguely worded threats. <i>See Matson,</i> 818 A.2d at 214-15 (vacating &#167; 751 conviction where defendant physically interfered with police officer's arrest of another person, but did not strike officer, threaten him, or call him names, because such conduct was not \"intimidation\"); <i>State v. Janisczak,</i> 579 A.2d 736, 738 (Me.1990) (vacating &#167; 751 conviction where defendant had yelled and cursed at officers as they struggled with a large, violent suspect, because such conduct was not \"intimidation\"). Accordingly, summary judgment was proper on the MWPA claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. First Amendment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Tripp, Cole and the Town retaliated against him for speech protected by the First Amendment, namely (1) his conversation with Cole, and (2) his remark to two selectmen that his relationship with Cole had \"cooled\" as a result of the Thurston summons incident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In assessing a public employee's claim of workplace retaliation for speech, we apply a three-part test: \"(1) whether the speech involves a matter of public concern; (2) whether, when balanced against each other, the First Amendment interests of the plaintiff and the public outweigh the government's interest in functioning efficiently; and (3) whether the protected speech was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse action against the plaintiff.\" <i>Mihos v. Swift,</i> 358 F.3d 91, 102 (1st Cir.2004). The district court determined that Tripp's speech at issue did not involve a matter of public concern. We review that decision <i>de novo. O'Connor v.

On the other hand, public-employee speech on a topic which would not necessarily qualify, on the basis of its content alone, as a matter of inherent public concern (e.g., internal working conditions, affecting only the speaker and co-workers), may require a more complete <i>Connick</i> analysis into the form and context of the public-employee expression, `as revealed by the whole record,' with a view to whether the community has in fact manifested a legitimate concern in the internal workings of the particular agency or department of government, and, if so, whether the `form' of the employee's expression suggests a subjective intent to contribute to any such public discourse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>O'Connor,</i> 994 F.2d at 913-14 (citations and emphases omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first address Tripp's statements to the selectmen that his relationship with Cole had \"cooled.\" These are classic examples of speech concerning \"internal working conditions, affecting only the speaker and co-workers.\" <i>Id.</i> at 914. Moreover, the record does not reveal that \"the community has in fact manifested a legitimate concern in the internal workings\" of the Bethel police department or its interactions with the Town Manager, nor that \"the `form' of [Tripp's] expression suggests a subjective intent to contribute to any such public discourse.\" <i>Id.</i> That ends that matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perhaps recognizing that the disposition of a particular \"dog at large\" summons is rarely a \"matter of inherent concern to the electorate,\" <i>id.</i> at 913-14, Tripp invokes larger themes. In his view, the public concern of his speech lay in the principle that \"[a] citizen from an affluent neighborhood of the community should abide by the same rules and be subject to the same consequences as those from more modest circumstances.\" Tripp made a similar argument to the magistrate judge. As she noted, \"[a]ccording to Tripp, `there can be no higher public concern than to have justice evenly administered without the Town's administrators capriciously granting favors to special citizens.'\" <i>Tripp I,</i> 2004 WL 2185840, *5, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25124 at *18. However, as the magistrate judge also observed, \"[t]he problem with this argument is that it does not identify any `given statement' by Tripp; it only offers Tripp's personal opinion as to what Cole's personal motives were when he interceded on Ms. Thurston's behalf.\" <i>Id.</i> The magistrate judge was correct. In the absence of any citation to evidence in the summary judgment record that Tripp explained to Cole his concern about the unequal administration of justice, Tripp cannot establish that his speech to Cole invoked a matter of public concern which led to his retaliatory dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tripp cites only his statement to Cole that he was \"not comfortable\" with Cole's request. An opaque statement such as \"I'm not comfortable doing this\" is not \"<i>clearly</i> a legitimate matter of <i>inherent</i> concern to the electorate.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphases added). It certainly does not invoke the unequal administration of justice concern. As stated, the content of Tripp's speech conveyed nothing more than his preference not to intercede with the ADA in the resolution of a particular dog at large summons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"form and context\" analysis does not assist Tripp either. Under <i>O'Connor,</i> speech on internal working conditions may rise to the level of public concern if \"the community has in fact manifested a legitimate concern in the internal workings of the particular agency or department of government, and . . . the `form' of the employee's expression suggests a subjective intent to contribute to any such public discourse.\" 994 F.2d at 914; <i>see, e.g., Baron v.

As a result of the investigation and prosecution of the dog at large incident, a disagreement arose between the police chief, plaintiff-appellant Darren Tripp, and the town manager, defendant-appellee Scott Cole. Cole wanted Tripp to intercede with the district attorney on behalf of the dog owner; Tripp expressed his discomfort with the request. Four months later, citing various issues unrelated to the dog at large incident, Cole suspended Tripp for a month; he later fired him. Tripp then sued Cole and the Town of Bethel, claiming that he had been retaliated against for speech protected under the First Amendment and state law.

According to witnesses (including the town engineer), the animal control officer pursued the dog into the owner's garage and captured it there, when, arguably, it was no longer a dog at large.

Eventually (after checking with the town engineer), Cole asked Tripp to dismiss the summons. Tripp &#8212; who surreptitiously recorded the conversation &#8212; responded that the matter was now in the district attorney's hands. Cole then asked Tripp to ask the district attorney to \"dump\" the summons, and insisted on Tripp's word that he would do so.

Tripp went to Cole's office and told him that he had relayed Cole's request, although Cole testified at his deposition that he had no idea whether or not Tripp had relayed the request.

The notice listed a variety of alleged misdeeds by Tripp, some of which were two years old, most of which had never been mentioned to Tripp before, and none of which had ever been noted in his personnel file. Tripp conceded that some, though not all, were true.

First, he argues that the court wrongly held that his conduct was not protected by the MWPA. Tripp asserts that Cole's request was an unlawful obstruction of government administration which Tripp reported to Cole himself and to two Bethel selectmen. Second, Tripp argues that the court wrongly held that his speech was not protected by the First Amendment because it did not involve a matter of public concern. He argues that his speech involved the important public issue of the legality and propriety of town officials interceding on behalf of affluent citizens to give them more favorable treatment in court.

Tripp argues that it was reasonable to believe that Cole's request to ask the prosecutor to \"dump\" the Thurston summons was a violation of Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &#167; 751(1), under which \"[a] person is guilty of obstructing government administration if the person intentionally interferes by force, violence or intimidation or by any physical act with a public servant performing . . . an official function.\" In Tripp's view, Cole attempted to interfere by intimidating Tripp into seeking the termination of an ongoing criminal proceeding; Tripp informed Cole and two selectmen that such a request was illegal; and he was suspended (and eventually fired) as a result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that Tripp had not engaged in protected activity for two independent reasons: (1) a reasonable person would not have considered Cole's request to be an obstruction of government administration, and (2) Tripp never reported to anyone his alleged belief that Cole's request was illegal. <i>See Tripp I,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2185840</span></span>, at *3, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. Dist.

In particular, we have not found, and Tripp has not cited, any Maine case where a government official was prosecuted under &#167; 751 for an order to a subordinate employee. To the contrary, in virtually all of the reported cases under &#167; 751 and its predecessor common law doctrine, the defendant had attempted to prevent a law enforcement officer from effecting a search or arrest. Therefore, if we accepted Tripp's theory, he would be the first victim of that particular form of obstructing government administration in over 100 years of reported Maine cases. To be sure, the words of the statute do not foreclose the possibility that &#167; 751 could apply to a public official's order to a subordinate. But \"[i]f we are unwilling to stretch state precedents to reach new frontiers, a litigant like [Tripp], who deliberately chose to reject a state-court forum in favor of a federal forum . . . is in a perilously poor position to grumble about our stodginess.\" <i>Porter v.

Tripp cites Cole's statement that \"I made my request and I'm expecting it to be honored.\" Viewed in the light most favorable to Tripp, this statement might sound like a vaguely worded threat to his continued employment with the Town. But Maine courts have interpreted &#167; 751 to require much more than vaguely worded threats. <i>See Matson,</i> 818 A.2d at 214-15 (vacating &#167; 751 conviction where defendant physically interfered with police officer's arrest of another person, but did not strike officer, threaten him, or call him names, because such conduct was not \"intimidation\"); <i>State v.

However, as the magistrate judge also observed, \"[t]he problem with this argument is that it does not identify any `given statement' by Tripp; it only offers Tripp's personal opinion as to what Cole's personal motives were when he interceded on Ms. Thurston's behalf.\" <i>Id.</i> The magistrate judge was correct. In the absence of any citation to evidence in the summary judgment record that Tripp explained to Cole his concern about the unequal administration of justice, Tripp cannot establish that his speech to Cole invoked a matter of public concern which led to his retaliatory dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tripp cites only his statement to Cole that he was \"not comfortable\" with Cole's request. An opaque statement such as \"I'm not comfortable doing this\" is not \"<i>clearly</i> a legitimate matter of <i>inherent</i> concern to the electorate.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphases added).

Under <i>O'Connor,</i> speech on internal working conditions may rise to the level of public concern if \"the community has in fact manifested a legitimate concern in the internal workings of the particular agency or department of government, and . . . the `form' of the employee's expression suggests a subjective intent to contribute to any such public discourse.\" 994 F.2d at 914; <i>see, e.g., Baron v.

We read this argument charitably to say that, because defendants did not give Tripp a proper opportunity to respond to the allegations against him, they should not be permitted to rely on those allegations to justify his termination.
