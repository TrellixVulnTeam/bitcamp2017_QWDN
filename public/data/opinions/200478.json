Hartmut Rathje, Kenth Persson,\n\nand Rolf Sjöström, (collectively, the \"Officers\") were the captain,\n\nchief   engineer,   and   chief   engineer/consulting   superintendent,\n\nrespectively, of the M/S SCOTIA PRINCE.          The SCOTIA PRINCE is a\n\ncargo and passenger ferry operated by Scotia Prince Cruises, Ltd.\n\n(\"SPC\")   between   Portland,     Maine   and   Yarmouth,   Nova   Scotia.\n\nClaiming they were fired in April 2001, the Officers brought suit\n\nunder the federal court’s admiralty jurisdiction against SPC for\n\nbreach of their employment contracts. SPC raised as a defense that\n\nthe Officers had resigned and counterclaimed, alleging that the\n\nOfficers had breached a fiduciary duty by failing to maintain the\n\nvessel.\n\n           A bench trial was held by consent before a magistrate\n\njudge, who held that (a) Rathje and Persson resigned without giving\n\nprior notice pursuant to their employment contracts and therefore\n\nwere not entitled to wages following their departure from the\n\nvessel; (b) SPC terminated Sjöström's employment as consulting\n\nsuperintendent (though not as chief engineer) without permitting\n\nhim to work his \"notice period\" of nine months and therefore owed\n\nSjöström nine months of superintendent pay; and (c) the Officers\n\nwere not liable to SPC for any negligent maintenance of the vessel.\n\nAll issues are appealed: Rathje and Persson appeal the decision\n\nthat they are not entitled to wages and vacation pay; SPC appeals\n\nthe decision that it is liable to Sjöström for damages and that its\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fformer employees are not liable for damage to the ship.             After\n\nreviewing the record, we affirm.\n\n                           I.   Background Facts\n\n           We recount only the facts relevant to our decision; a\n\nmore complete description of the facts can be found in the district\n\ncourt's opinion.       See Rathje v. Scotia Prince Cruises, Ltd., No.\n\n01-123-P-DMC, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4078, at *5-38 (D. Me. Mar. 13,\n\n2002).\n\n           The Officers began working aboard the M/S SCOTIA PRINCE\n\nin the late 1980s.       Each Officer had an employment contract with\n\nPrince of Fundy Cruises, Ltd. (\"POF\"), SPC's predecessor.          Notice\n\ntime for termination under Rathje's employment contract was three\n\nmonths; under Persson's contract, sixty days notice was required.\n\nSjöström's contract stated: \"[Nine] months notice of termination\n\nrequired   by   both    parties.\"    Sjöström   worked   in   Sweden;   POF\n\ncontracted first with the Swedish company Marine Trading and then\n\nwith Plus 2 Ferryconsultation AB (\"Plus 2\") to pay Sjöström's\n\nsalary in Swedish kronas.\n\n           At the beginning of the 2001 season, SPC's Chairman,\n\nMatthew Hudson, met with the Officers and advised them that he was\n\ncontemplating the engagement of International Shipping Partners,\n\nInc. (\"ISP\"), a manning/purchasing contractor.           Although several\n\ntop managers had been fired, Hudson assured the Officers that this\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fwould   not    affect   their   contracts,   which   were    \"ring-fenced.\"1\n\nHudson also stated that the employees who had been terminated would\n\nreceive a severance package of one week's pay for each year of\n\nservice with the company.\n\n              Hudson engaged ISP the next morning, April 5, 2001, to\n\ntake over the complete management of the vessel.            ISP met with the\n\nOfficers and presented a budget showing Rathje and Persson to be\n\nreceiving significantly less compensation than provided in their\n\ncurrent contracts, and Sjöström to be receiving no compensation at\n\nall as superintendent (because ISP assumed those duties).               The\n\nOfficers were upset, and the meeting ended with the Officers\n\ntelling ISP, \"Basically it's either you or us.\"\n\n              Over the course of the next few days, several email\n\nmessages and facsimiles were sent between the Officers and Hudson.\n\nIn their first message, the Officers wrote:\n\n              As it stand[s] now, we see only two options.\n              We stick to the agreement you presented last\n              night, i.e. ISP serves as a manning agency\n              only and the current contracts and conditions\n              are maintained, possible new conditions only\n              applying to new hires. Alternatively, if ISP\n              takes over both complete manning and technical\n              management, we ([Rathje and Persson]) accept\n              the standard severance package (one week for\n              every year of service) and [Sjöström] gives\n              the 9-month notice in accordance with his\n              contract.\n\n\n\n\n1\n   The parties understood this to mean that the contracts were\nlocked-in and would not be altered.\n\n                                    -4-\n\f           When Hudson responded that their contracts were \"ring-\n\nfenced,\" the Officers asked Hudson to focus on the statement\n\nbeginning \"As it stands now . . . \" so they could \"concentrate on\n\n[their] jobs or go home.\"       In response, Hudson stated, \"I consider\n\nthat the [Officers] have effectively resigned and I accept those\n\nresignations on behalf of [SPC].\"\n\n           The Officers' last day was April 20; Rathje and Persson\n\nacknowledge     payment   in    full   up    to   that   date   and   Sjöström\n\nacknowledges payment in full to April 30.           They filed this lawsuit\n\nseeking payment for the termination periods provided for in their\n\ncontracts.\n\n           After the Officers were replaced, SPC discovered various\n\nproblems with the upkeep of the ship including damage to the wood.\n\nSPC alleged that the Officers were responsible, and cross-claimed\n\nfor more than one million dollars.            The bench trial was held on\n\nFebruary 11-15, 2002, and a decision was issued on March 13, 2002.\n\nThis appeal followed.\n\n                          II.   Standard of Review\n\n             We review the district court's legal conclusions de novo.\n\nWatson v. Deaconess Waltham Hosp., 298 F.3d 102, 108 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).   We review factual determinations for clear error.             Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 52(a) (2003).      Our job is to determine whether the decision\n\nbelow is reasonable in light of the entire record.              See Portland\n\nNatural Gas Transmission Sys. v. 19.2 Acres of Land, 318 F.3d 279,\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\f281 (1st Cir. 2003).        We give great respect to the district court's\n\n\"opportunity       to    hear   the     testimony,     observe         the   witnesses'\n\ndemeanor, and evaluate the facts at first hand,\" United States v.\n\nNee, 261 F.3d 79, 84 (1st Cir. 2001) (internal quotation omitted),\n\nand defer to the trial court's findings unless \"we form a strong,\n\nunyielding belief that a mistake has been made.\" Windsor Mount Joy\n\nMut. Ins. Co. v. Giragosian, 57 F.3d 50, 53 (1st Cir. 1995)\n\n(internal   quotation       omitted).         Even   then,       we   may    affirm   the\n\njudgment on any grounds revealed by the record.                       United States v.\n\nPuerto Rico, 287 F.3d 212, 218 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n                                III.     Discussion\n\n            We have jurisdiction over this dispute, which arises out\n\nof employment contracts aboard a vessel. See U.S. Const. Art. III,\n\n§ 2; 28 U.S.C. § 1333(2003); 7A J.W. Moore, Moore's Federal\n\nPractice    §    0.225,    at   2701,    §   0.230,    at    2783      (2d    ed.   1996)\n\n(hereinafter Moore's Federal Practice). The Federal Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure apply to admiralty cases.               Fed. R. Civ. P. 1 (2003).           The\n\nsubstantive matter is governed, in hierarchical order, by federal\n\nstatutes and treaties, general maritime law developed by the\n\nSupreme Court, state statutes, and finally common law decisions of\n\nthe state courts. 1A Moore's Federal Practice § 0.326, at 3233-35.\n\n\"State law may supplement maritime law where maritime law is silent\n\n. . ., but state law may not be applied where it is materially\n\ndifferent       than    maritime   law,      or   where     it    would      defeat   the\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\freasonably settled expectations of maritime actors.\" Windsor Mount\n\nJoy Mut. Ins. Co. v. Giragosian, 57 F.3d 50, 54 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n           A.    Rathje and Persson\n\n           Rathje and Persson appeal from the district court's\n\ndetermination that they resigned and were therefore not entitled to\n\ntermination pay under their employment contracts.                They attack\n\nseveral findings of fact made by the district court, asserting that\n\nit was clear error for the court to find that neither Officer (1)\n\ncould have reasonably believed he was being terminated, (2) could\n\nhave reasonably believed that he was entitled to severance pay that\n\nwas not mentioned in his contract, (3) could have reasonably\n\nbelieved that he was relieved from his obligation to give notice to\n\nSPC before quitting, and (4) was entitled to termination pay.               We\n\nfind that the district court's findings are not clearly erroneous.\n\n           First, the record shows that Rathje and Persson wrote to\n\nHudson, acknowledging that they were \"fenced-in and protected,\n\nmeaning that nobody could touch our contracts.\"              Their claim that\n\nHudson effectively terminated them by contracting with ISP (whose\n\nnumbers showed their pay reduced by thirty percent) thus fails\n\nbecause    the   Officers   understood        that   their   contracts     were\n\nunalterable.     The Officers never sought clarification from Hudson,\n\nthe chairman, about ISP's new role, and Hudson never told the\n\nOfficers   anything    to   suggest    that    their   contracts    were    not\n\nprotected.\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f          As evidence of their mindset at the time and support for\n\ntheir belief that they, too, were being terminated, Rathje and\n\nPersson point to the fact that several other long-time employees\n\nwere fired by Hudson.   This is not persuasive, however, because\n\nnone of the other employees were fired by email message, and Hudson\n\nhad reassured Rathje and Persson both orally and in writing that\n\ntheir contracts were secure.   The record shows that the Officers\n\nwere treated differently than other employees.     It was therefore\n\nnot clearly erroneous for the district court to find that Rathje\n\nand Persson could not reasonably believe that they were implicitly\n\nterminated by email message.\n\n          Second, while Hudson mentioned to Rathje and Persson that\n\nit would be good for them to \"know about\" a severance plan for\n\nemployees, he did not specifically state that it applied to them.\n\nEach officer had a written contract stating \"I cannot claim any\n\nadditional benefits or wages of any kind (except) those which have\n\nbeen provided in this contract.\"   It was therefore not clear error\n\nfor the district court to find that Rathje and Persson could not\n\nhave reasonably believed that they were entitled to a newly-\n\nintroduced extrinsic severance package.\n\n          Third, it was not clear error for the district court to\n\nfind that Rathje and Persson's belief that they did not have to\n\ngive notice because Hudson offered to pay them \"ex gratia\" was\n\nirrelevant to the breach of employment contract.    The court found\n\n\n                               -8-\n\fthat any offer by Hudson (discussed in greater detail in Part\n\n(III)(C), below) was made after the Officers resigned; therefore,\n\nit was too late for Rathje or Persson to give notice in order to\n\ncomply with his employment contract.        It is irrelevant whether the\n\nOfficers no longer believed they had to give notice -- they were no\n\nlonger entitled to give notice.\n\n            Finally, it was not clearly erroneous for the court to\n\ndetermine that Rathje and Persson were not entitled to termination\n\npay because they were unwilling to work their notice period.          The\n\nrecord shows that Rathje and Persson presented an ultimatum to\n\nHudson -- that he either cancel his (binding) contract with ISP or\n\nthe Officers would leave the ship.       It was plausible for the court\n\nto   find   that   Rathje   and   Persson   were   threatening   to   quit\n\nimmediately and not simply giving notice of their resignations.\n\n            To summarize, we affirm the district court's factual\n\ndeterminations that Rathje and Persson resigned without giving\n\nnotice and are therefore not entitled to damages because the\n\nfindings are plausible in light of the evidence.2       CEH, Inc. v. F/V\n\nSeafarer, 70 F.3d 694, 698 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n\n\n\n2\n    Because we affirm the district court's determination that\nPersson is not entitled to damages, we need not decide whether he\nis a seaman entitled to double wages. See 46 U.S.C. § 10313(g)\n(2003).\n\n                                   -9-\n\f           B.     Sjöström\n\n           SPC challenges the district court's ruling that it is\n\nliable to Sjöström for nine months termination pay in his position\n\nas consulting superintendent.           The district court found that\n\nSjöström's position as consulting superintendent was eliminated as\n\nsoon as Hudson contracted with ISP, thereby prohibiting Sjöström\n\nfrom working his notice period.\n\n           SPC first claims that Sjöström was not its employee but\n\nwas employed by Plus 2.      Testimony supports the district court's\n\ndetermination that, while Plus 2 handled the administrative aspects\n\nof Sjöström's employment via a contract with SPC (to the benefit of\n\nboth   Sjöström    and   SPC),   the   terms   of   Sjöström's   employment\n\ncontinued to be dictated by his original contract with SPC's\n\npredecessor, which was renewed annually by the course of dealing of\n\nthe parties.    Sjöström was not a party to the contract between Plus\n\n2 and SPC, and that contract did not supersede his employment\n\ncontract with POF (which was later assumed by SPC).                We find\n\nnothing clearly erroneous in the finding that Sjöström was an\n\nemployee of SPC.\n\n           SPC also asserts that it was entitled to fire Sjöström\n\nbecause he had disregarded orders to cease making purchases through\n\nMarine Trading. While SPC did argue that Sjöström had breached his\n\ncontract by negligently maintaining the SCOTIA PRINCE, it never\n\nbefore argued that Sjöström was in breach by dealing with Marine\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fTrading.     This argument was not raised below and is therefore\n\nwaived.     Brigham v. Sun Life of Can., 317 F.3d 72, 85 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).\n\n            Finally, SPC claims that its damages should be reduced\n\nbecause Sjöström made no effort to mitigate his damages.          The\n\ncontract provided and the district court found that \"Sjöström's\n\nright either to be permitted to work his notice period or to\n\nreceive compensation in lieu thereof was absolute.\"      Rathje, 2002\n\nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 4078, at * 43.    Sjöström therefore did not have a\n\nduty to mitigate damages.\n\n            C.   Officers' Alternative Theory\n\n            The Officers assert that even if they resigned, they\n\nentered into a later contract with Hudson.      In an email message to\n\nthe Officers, after Hudson writes that he considers the Officers\n\nresigned, he writes:\n\n            As [the Officers] have resigned there seems to\n            be no requirement to pay termination. On the\n            other hand I believe the [Rathje] and\n            [Persson] contracts would normally provide for\n            termination of two or three months if the\n            Company had terminated their employment. I am\n            prepared to pay this sum to each on an ex\n            gratia basis, given a proper and fully\n            cooperative handover to the satisfaction of\n            ISP during the next 14 days.\n\n(Emphasis added.)    Asked for clarification by the Officers, Hudson\n\nreiterated his offer in another email message, also noting that\n\nSjöström was entitled to termination pay in his capacity as chief\n\nengineer.\n\n                                 -11-\n\f           The Officers claim that they worked through April 20,\n\nsatisfying their obligation under the new contract, but did not\n\nreceive any pay for their termination periods.         Thus, they assert\n\nthat SPC is in breach and liable for damages.\n\n           The Officers contend that the court improperly excluded\n\nevidence   of   this   new   contract   as   an   inadmissible   offer   of\n\nsettlement. They maintain that the district court should have read\n\ntheir complaint broadly to incorporate two claims - one for breach\n\nof employment contract, and one for a separate contract formed\n\nafter employment had ceased.      SPC argues that the district court\n\ndid consider both arguments, and implicitly found that no new\n\ncontract was formed.\n\n           1.   Were two claims litigated?\n\n           Upon review of the record, we find that the district\n\ncourt did not consider the issue of whether or not a separate\n\ncontract was formed between SPC and the Officers.          At trial, the\n\ncourt stated that it was \"clear that this is a claim of breach of\n\nan employment contract.\"       The district court admitted the above\n\nemail messages only \"for the purpose of completeness of the story\n\nof the parties' ongoing dealings rather than as proof of SPC's\n\nliability for, or the invalidity of, a claim or its amount.\"\n\nRathje, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4078, at *24, n.13, *26, n.15, *27,\n\nn.16.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\f           In its findings of fact, the court stated only that\n\n\"[n]egotiations between Hudson and the Plaintiffs concerning his\n\noffered 'ex gratia' payments broke down.\"      Id. at *27.    In its\n\nconclusions of law, the court considered Hudson's email messages\n\noffering termination pay only for their potential effect on a\n\nbreach of employment claim by the Officers -- and found that there\n\nwas no effect because the employment had already ceased when the\n\nstatements were made.    Id. at *45-46.   It is therefore clear that\n\nthe court read the complaint only to incorporate a breach of\n\nemployment claim, and not to also include a breach of a separate\n\ncontract between the parties.\n\n           2.   Was it error to exclude the alternative theory?\n\n           We now consider whether it was error for the district\n\ncourt to exclude the claim.   A complaint must include \"a short and\n\nplain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled\n\nto relief\" and \"a demand for judgment for the relief the pleader\n\nseeks.\"   Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a).    This simplified pleading standard\n\nmust \"give the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff's claim\n\nis and the grounds upon which it rests.\"      Conley v. Gibson, 355\n\nU.S. 41, 47 (1957).   A breach of contract complaint must allege (1)\n\nthe existence of a valid and binding contract; (2) that plaintiff\n\nhas complied with the contract and performed his own obligations\n\nunder it; and (3) breach of the contract causing damages.    5 Wright\n\n\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\f& Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1235, at 268-70 (2d ed.\n\n2002).\n\n            The Officers claim that the following language identifies\n\na claim for breach of a separate contract:\n\n            [T]he plaintiffs conferred by facsimile and/or\n            emails on several occasions resulting in the\n            wrongful termination of plaintiffs.     In any\n            event, defendants agreed that plaintiff's last\n            day of work would be April 20, 2001 and that\n            they would be paid their wages, vacation days\n            and time off in accordance with their\n            contracts for that period of time that there\n            was to be a notice of termination as stated in\n            their contracts.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n            While   the   Officers'    complaint    clearly   establishes   a\n\nbreach of employment contract claim, it fails to set forth the\n\nbasic elements to show that a separate contract was formed by the\n\nparties after conclusion of the employment relationship.                  The\n\ncomplaint states that \"defendants agreed\" that plaintiffs would\n\nwork two weeks and be paid their notice of termination period but\n\ndoes not explain how this agreement arose, whether it was a binding\n\ncontract, whether plaintiffs performed under the contract, and\n\nwhether   defendants      breached    the    contract.   It   therefore     is\n\ninsufficient to establish a claim for breach of a subsequent\n\ncontract.    The district court properly read the complaint to only\n\ninclude a breach of employment contract claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\f          D.   Maintenance Cross-Appeal\n\n          Finally, SPC appeals the decision that the Officers were\n\nnot liable for negligent maintenance of the vessel.      There was\n\nconflicting testimony about the extent or existence of damage to\n\nthe vessel, and the court found only that SPC may incur additional\n\ncost as a result of negligent maintenance of the wood railings,\n\ndoors, and deck.   There is nothing to suggest that the district\n\ncourt's findings as to upkeep were clearly erroneous.\n\n          It is unclear whether SPC attempts to make a breach of\n\nemployment contract claim, a fiduciary duty claim, or a negligence\n\nclaim, but it is irrelevant because each claim is meritless.\n\nNothing in the Officers' employment contracts mentions upkeep of\n\nthe vessel, no testimony suggested that the Officers were required\n\nto maintain the vessel, and the record is absent of any discussion\n\nby the parties regarding any such duty.   The breach of employment\n\ncontract therefore fails.\n\n          Both a breach of fiduciary duty and negligence claim are\n\npredicated upon a duty owed by the Officers to the ship owner.\n\nHere, however, SPC claims only to be the operator of the SCOTIA\n\nPRINCE. It introduced no evidence to show that it owned the vessel\n\nand, in fact, the record shows the owner to be Transworld Steamship\n\nCompany (Panama), Inc.   Even if SPC were somehow analogous to an\n\nowner, SPC's claim for negligent maintenance would fail.   While a\n\nseaman has a duty to perform the duties of his position with\n\n\n                               -15-\n\fdiligence, faithfulness, and reasonable skill, see generally 2\n\nNorton, The Law of Seaman § 25.16 (4th ed. 1985), SPC has not shown\n\nthat any of the Officers were responsible for maintaining the\n\nwoodwork on the vessel.      There is no authority in the lengthy\n\nhistory of admiralty cases to support the position that, on these\n\nfacts, the Officers can be held liable (under a fiduciary or\n\nnegligence theory) to the owner of the vessel for non-intentional\n\nnegligent    maintenance,    and    we    refuse   to   establish   such\n\njurisprudence here.\n\n                            IV.    Conclusion\n\n            The decision of the district court is affirmed. No costs\n\nare awarded to either side.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\f",

The SCOTIA PRINCE is a cargo and passenger ferry operated by Scotia Prince Cruises, Ltd. (\"SPC\") between Portland, Maine and Yarmouth, Nova Scotia. Claiming they were fired in April 2001, the Officers brought suit under the federal court's admiralty jurisdiction against SPC for breach of their employment contracts. SPC raised as a defense that the Officers had resigned and counterclaimed, alleging that the Officers had breached a fiduciary duty by failing to maintain the vessel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A bench trial was held by consent before a magistrate judge, who held that (a) Rathje and Persson resigned without giving prior notice pursuant to their employment contracts and therefore were not entitled to wages following their departure from the vessel; (b) SPC terminated Sj&#246;str&#246;m's employment as consulting superintendent (though not as chief engineer) without permitting him to work his \"notice period\" of nine months and therefore owed Sj&#246;str&#246;m nine months of superintendent pay; and (c) the Officers were not liable to SPC for any negligent maintenance of the vessel. All issues are appealed: Rathje and Persson appeal the decision that they are not entitled to wages and vacation pay; SPC appeals the decision that it is liable to Sj&#246;str&#246;m for damages and that its former employees are not liable for damage to the ship.

Scotia Prince Cruises, Ltd.,</i> 2002 WL 389303 at *1-12, No. 01-123-P-DMC, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4078, at *5-38 (D.Me. Mar. 13, 2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Officers began working aboard the M/S SCOTIA PRINCE in the late 1980s. Each Officer had an employment contract with Prince of Fundy Cruises, Ltd. (\"POF\"), SPC's predecessor. Notice time for termination under Rathje's employment contract was three months; under Persson's contract, sixty days notice was required. Sj&#246;str&#246;m's contract stated: \"[Nine] months notice of termination required by both parties.\" Sj&#246;str&#246;m worked in Sweden; POF contracted first with the Swedish company Marine Trading and then with Plus 2 Ferryconsultation AB (\"Plus 2\") to pay Sj&#246;str&#246;m's salary in Swedish kronas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the beginning of the 2001 season, SPC's Chairman, Matthew Hudson, met with the Officers and advised them that he was contemplating the engagement of International Shipping Partners, Inc. (\"ISP\"), a manning/purchasing contractor. Although several top managers had been fired, Hudson assured the Officers that this would not affect their contracts, which were \"ring-fenced.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Hudson also stated that the employees who had been terminated would receive a severance package of one week's pay for each year of service with the company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hudson engaged ISP the next morning, April 5, 2001, to take over the complete management of the vessel. ISP met with the Officers and presented a budget showing Rathje and Persson to be receiving significantly less compensation than provided in their current contracts, and Sj&#246;str&#246;m to be receiving no compensation at all as superintendent (because ISP assumed those duties). The Officers were upset, and the meeting ended with the Officers telling ISP, \"Basically it's either you or us.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over the course of the next few days, several email messages and facsimiles were sent between the Officers and Hudson. In their first message, the Officers wrote:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As it stand[s] now, we see only two options. We stick to the agreement you presented last night, i.e. ISP serves as a manning agency only and the current contracts and conditions are maintained, possible new conditions only applying to new hires. Alternatively, if ISP takes over both complete manning and technical management, we ([Rathje and Persson]) accept the standard severance package (one week for every year of service) and [Sj&#246;str&#246;m] gives the 9-month notice in accordance with his contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Hudson responded that their contracts were \"ring-fenced,\" the Officers asked Hudson to focus on the statement beginning \"As it stands now ...\" so they could \"concentrate on [their] jobs or go home.\" In response, Hudson stated, \"I consider that the [Officers] have effectively resigned and I accept those resignations on behalf of [SPC].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Officers' last day was April 20; Rathje and Persson acknowledge payment in full up to that date and Sj&#246;str&#246;m acknowledges payment in full to April 30. They filed this lawsuit seeking payment for the termination periods provided for in their contracts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the Officers were replaced, SPC discovered various problems with the up-keep of the ship including damage to the wood. SPC alleged that the Officers were responsible, and cross-claimed for more than one million dollars. The bench trial was held on February 11-15, 2002, and a decision was issued on March 13, 2002. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's legal conclusions de novo. <i>Watson v. Deaconess Waltham Hosp.,</i> 298 F.3d 102, 108 (1st Cir.2002). We review factual determinations for clear error. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a) (2003). Our job is to determine whether the decision below is reasonable in light of the entire record. <i>See Portland Natural Gas Transmission Sys. v. 19.2 Acres of Land,</i> 318 F.3d 279, 281 (1st Cir.2003). We give great respect to the district court's \"opportunity to hear the testimony, observe the witnesses' demeanor, and evaluate the facts at first hand,\" <i>United States v. Nee,</i> 261 F.3d 79, 84 (1st Cir.2001) (internal quotation omitted), and defer to the trial court's findings unless \"we form a strong, unyielding belief that a mistake has been made.\" <i>Windsor Mount Joy Mut. Ins. Co. v. Giragosian,</i> 57 F.3d 50, 53 (1st Cir.1995) (internal quotation omitted). Even then, we may affirm the judgment on any grounds revealed by the record. <i>United States v. Puerto Rico,</i> 287 F.3d 212, 218 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have jurisdiction over this dispute, which arises out of employment contracts aboard a vessel. <i>See</i> U.S. Const. Art. III, &#167; 2; 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1333(2003); 7A J.W. Moore, <i>Moore's Federal Practice</i> &#167; 0.225, at 2701, &#167; 0.230, at 2783 (2d ed.1996) (hereinafter <i>Moore's Federal Practice</i>). The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure apply to admiralty cases. Fed. R.Civ.P. 1 (2003). The substantive matter is governed, in hierarchical order, by federal statutes and treaties, general maritime law developed by the Supreme Court, state statutes, and finally common law decisions of the state courts. 1A <i>Moore's Federal Practice</i> &#167; 0.326, at 3233-35. \"State law may supplement maritime law where maritime law is silent ..., but state law may not be applied where it is materially different than maritime law, or where it would defeat the reasonably settled expectations of maritime actors.\" <i>Windsor Mount Joy Mut. Ins. Co. v. Giragosian,</i> 57 F.3d 50, 54 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>A. Rathje and Persson</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rathje and Persson appeal from the district court's determination that they resigned and were therefore not entitled to termination pay under their employment contracts. They attack several findings of fact made by the district court, asserting that it was clear error for the court to find that neither Officer (1) could have reasonably believed he was being terminated, (2) could have reasonably believed that he was entitled to severance pay that was not mentioned in his contract, (3) could have reasonably believed that he was relieved from his obligation to give notice to SPC before quitting, and (4) was entitled to termination pay. We find that the district court's findings are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the record shows that Rathje and Persson wrote to Hudson, acknowledging that they were \"fenced-in and protected, meaning that nobody could touch our contracts.\" Their claim that Hudson effectively terminated them by contracting with ISP (whose numbers showed their pay reduced by thirty percent) thus fails because the Officers understood that their contracts were unalterable. The Officers never sought clarification from Hudson, the chairman, about ISP's new role, and Hudson never told the Officers anything to suggest that their contracts were not protected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As evidence of their mindset at the time and support for their belief that they, too, were being terminated, Rathje and Persson point to the fact that several other long-time employees were fired by Hudson. This is not persuasive, however, because none of the other employees were fired by email message, and Hudson had reassured Rathje and Persson both orally and in writing that their contracts were secure. The record shows that the Officers were treated differently than other employees. It was therefore not clearly erroneous for the district court to find that Rathje and Persson could not reasonably believe that they were implicitly terminated by email message.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, while Hudson mentioned to Rathje and Persson that it would be good for them to \"know about\" a severance plan for employees, he did not specifically state that it applied to them. Each officer had a written contract stating \"I cannot claim any additional benefits or wages of any kind (except) those which have been provided in this contract.\" It was therefore not clear error for the district court to find that Rathje and Persson could not have reasonably believed that they were entitled to a newly-introduced extrinsic severance package.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, it was not clear error for the district court to find that Rathje and Persson's belief that they did not have to give notice because Hudson offered to pay them \"ex gratia\" was irrelevant to the breach of employment contract. The court found that any offer by Hudson (discussed in greater detail in Part (III)(C), below) was made <i>after</i> the Officers resigned; therefore, it was too late for Rathje or Persson to give notice in order to comply with his employment contract. It is irrelevant whether the Officers no longer believed they had to give notice &#8212; they were no longer entitled to give notice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, it was not clearly erroneous for the court to determine that Rathje and Persson were not entitled to termination pay because they were unwilling to work their notice period. The record shows that Rathje and Persson presented an ultimatum to Hudson &#8212; that he either cancel his (binding) contract with ISP or the Officers would leave the ship. It was plausible for the court to find that Rathje and Persson were threatening to quit immediately and not simply giving notice of their resignations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To summarize, we affirm the district court's factual determinations that Rathje and Persson resigned without giving notice and are therefore not entitled to damages because the findings are plausible in light of the evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>CEH, Inc. v. F/V Seafarer,</i> 70 F.3d 694, 698 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>B. Sj&#246;str&#246;m</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SPC challenges the district court's ruling that it is liable to Sj&#246;str&#246;m for nine months termination pay in his position as consulting superintendent. The district court found that Sj&#246;str&#246;m's position as consulting superintendent was eliminated as soon as Hudson contracted with ISP, thereby prohibiting Sj&#246;str&#246;m from working his notice period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SPC first claims that Sj&#246;str&#246;m was not its employee but was employed by Plus 2. Testimony supports the district court's determination that, while Plus 2 handled the administrative aspects of Sj&#246;str&#246;m's employment via a contract with SPC (to the benefit of both Sj&#246;str&#246;m and SPC), the terms of Sj&#246;str&#246;m's employment continued to be dictated by his original contract with SPC's predecessor, which was renewed annually by the course of dealing of the parties. Sj&#246;str&#246;m was not a party to the contract between Plus 2 and SPC, and that contract did not supersede his employment contract with POF (which was later assumed by SPC). We find nothing clearly erroneous in the finding that Sj&#246;str&#246;m was an employee of SPC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SPC also asserts that it was entitled to fire Sj&#246;str&#246;m because he had disregarded orders to cease making purchases through Marine Trading. While SPC did argue that Sj&#246;str&#246;m had breached his contract by negligently maintaining the SCOTIA PRINCE, it never before argued that Sj&#246;str&#246;m was in breach by dealing with Marine Trading. This argument was not raised below and is therefore waived. <i>Brigham v. Sun Life of Can.,</i> 317 F.3d 72, 85 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, SPC claims that its damages should be reduced because Sj&#246;str&#246;m made no effort to mitigate his damages. The contract provided and the district court found that \"Sj&#246;str&#246;m's right either to be permitted to work his notice period or to receive compensation in lieu thereof was absolute.\" <i>Rathje,</i> 2002 WL 389303 at *12, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4078, at * 43. Sj&#246;str&#246;m therefore did not have a duty to mitigate damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>C. Officers' Alternative Theory</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Officers assert that even if they resigned, they entered into a later contract with Hudson. In an email message to the Officers, after Hudson writes that he considers the Officers resigned, he writes:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As [the Officers] have resigned there seems to be no requirement to pay termination. On the other hand I believe the [Rathje] and [Persson] contracts would normally provide for termination of two or three months if the Company had terminated their employment. <i>I am prepared to pay this sum to each on an ex gratia basis, given a proper and fully cooperative handover to the satisfaction of ISP during the next 14 days.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis added.) Asked for clarification by the Officers, Hudson reiterated his offer in another email message, also noting that Sj&#246;str&#246;m was entitled to termination pay in his capacity as chief engineer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Officers claim that they worked through April 20, satisfying their obligation under the new contract, but did not receive any pay for their termination periods. Thus, they assert that SPC is in breach and liable for damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Officers contend that the court improperly excluded evidence of this new contract as an inadmissible offer of settlement. They maintain that the district court should have read their complaint broadly to incorporate two claims &#8212; one for breach of employment contract, and one for a separate contract formed after employment had ceased. SPC argues that the district court <i>did</i> consider both arguments, and implicitly found that no new contract was formed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>1.

At trial, the court stated that it was \"clear that this is a claim of breach of an employment contract.\" The district court admitted the above email messages only \"for the purpose of completeness of the story of the parties' ongoing dealings rather than as proof of SPC's liability for, or the invalidity of, a claim or its amount.\" <i>Rathje,</i> at *8, n. 13, 15, 16, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4078, at *24, n. 13, *26, n. 15, *27, n. 16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its findings of fact, the court stated only that \"[n]egotiations between Hudson and the Plaintiffs concerning his offered `ex gratia' payments broke down.\" <i>Id.</i> at 8, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4078 at *27. In its conclusions of law, the court considered Hudson's email messages offering termination pay only for their potential effect on a breach of employment claim by the Officers &#8212; and found that there was no effect because the employment had already ceased when the statements were made. <i>Id.</i> at *14, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4078 at *45-46. It is therefore clear that the court read the complaint only to incorporate a breach of employment claim, and not to also include a breach of a separate contract between the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>2.

A complaint must include \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief\" and \"a demand for judgment for the relief the pleader seeks.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a). This simplified pleading standard must \"give the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff's claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\" <i>Conley v. Gibson,</i> 355 U.S. 41, 47, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957). A breach of contract complaint must allege (1) the existence of a valid and binding contract; (2) that plaintiff has complied with the contract and performed his own obligations under it; and (3) breach of the contract causing damages. 5 Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> &#167; 1235, at 268-70 (2d ed.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Officers claim that the following language identifies a claim for breach of a separate contract:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he plaintiffs conferred by facsimile and/or emails on several occasions resulting in the wrongful termination of plaintiffs. <i>In any event,</i> defendants agreed that plaintiff's last day of work would be April 20, 2001 and that they would be paid their wages, vacation days and time off in accordance with their contracts for that period of time that there was to be a notice of termination as stated in their contracts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the Officers' complaint clearly establishes a breach of employment contract claim, it fails to set forth the basic elements to show that a separate contract was formed by the parties after conclusion of the employment relationship. The complaint states that \"defendants agreed\" that plaintiffs would work two weeks and be paid their notice of termination period but does not explain how this agreement arose, whether it was a binding contract, whether plaintiffs performed under the contract, and whether defendants breached the contract. It therefore is insufficient to establish a claim for breach of a subsequent contract. The district court properly read the complaint to only include a breach of employment contract claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>D. Maintenance Cross-Appeal</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, SPC appeals the decision that the Officers were not liable for negligent maintenance of the vessel. There was conflicting testimony about the extent or existence of damage to the vessel, and the court found only that SPC may incur additional cost as a result of negligent maintenance of the wood railings, doors, and deck. There is nothing to suggest that the district court's findings as to upkeep were clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is unclear whether SPC attempts to make a breach of employment contract claim, a fiduciary duty claim, or a negligence claim, but it is irrelevant because each claim is meritless. Nothing in the Officers' employment contracts mentions upkeep of the vessel, no testimony suggested that the Officers were required to maintain the vessel, and the record is absent of any discussion by the parties regarding any such duty. The breach of employment contract therefore fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both a breach of fiduciary duty and negligence claim are predicated upon a duty owed by the Officers to the ship owner. Here, however, SPC claims only to be the operator of the SCOTIA PRINCE. It introduced no evidence to show that it owned the vessel and, in fact, the record shows the owner to be Transworld Steamship Company (Panama), Inc. Even if SPC were somehow analogous to an owner, SPC's claim for negligent maintenance would fail. While a seaman has a duty to perform the duties of his position with diligence, faithfulness, and reasonable skill, <i>see generally</i> 2 Norton, <i>The Law of Seaman</i> &#167; 25.16 (4th ed.1985), SPC has not shown that any of the Officers were responsible for maintaining the woodwork on the vessel. There is no authority in the lengthy history of admiralty cases to support the position that, on these facts, the Officers can be held liable (under a fiduciary or negligence theory) to the owner of the vessel for non-intentional negligent maintenance, and we refuse to establish such jurisprudence here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.

The SCOTIA PRINCE is a cargo and passenger ferry operated by Scotia Prince Cruises, Ltd. (\"SPC\") between Portland, Maine and Yarmouth, Nova Scotia. Claiming they were fired in April 2001, the Officers brought suit under the federal court's admiralty jurisdiction against SPC for breach of their employment contracts.

Each Officer had an employment contract with Prince of Fundy Cruises, Ltd. (\"POF\"), SPC's predecessor. Notice time for termination under Rathje's employment contract was three months; under Persson's contract, sixty days notice was required. Sj&#246;str&#246;m's contract stated: \"[Nine] months notice of termination required by both parties.\" Sj&#246;str&#246;m worked in Sweden; POF contracted first with the Swedish company Marine Trading and then with Plus 2 Ferryconsultation AB (\"Plus 2\") to pay Sj&#246;str&#246;m's salary in Swedish kronas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the beginning of the 2001 season, SPC's Chairman, Matthew Hudson, met with the Officers and advised them that he was contemplating the engagement of International Shipping Partners, Inc. (\"ISP\"), a manning/purchasing contractor. Although several top managers had been fired, Hudson assured the Officers that this would not affect their contracts, which were \"ring-fenced.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Hudson also stated that the employees who had been terminated would receive a severance package of one week's pay for each year of service with the company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hudson engaged ISP the next morning, April 5, 2001, to take over the complete management of the vessel. ISP met with the Officers and presented a budget showing Rathje and Persson to be receiving significantly less compensation than provided in their current contracts, and Sj&#246;str&#246;m to be receiving no compensation at all as superintendent (because ISP assumed those duties). The Officers were upset, and the meeting ended with the Officers telling ISP, \"Basically it's either you or us.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over the course of the next few days, several email messages and facsimiles were sent between the Officers and Hudson. In their first message, the Officers wrote:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As it stand[s] now, we see only two options. We stick to the agreement you presented last night, i.e. ISP serves as a manning agency only and the current contracts and conditions are maintained, possible new conditions only applying to new hires. Alternatively, if ISP takes over both complete manning and technical management, we ([Rathje and Persson]) accept the standard severance package (one week for every year of service) and [Sj&#246;str&#246;m] gives the 9-month notice in accordance with his contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Hudson responded that their contracts were \"ring-fenced,\" the Officers asked Hudson to focus on the statement beginning \"As it stands now ...\" so they could \"concentrate on [their] jobs or go home.\" In response, Hudson stated, \"I consider that the [Officers] have effectively resigned and I accept those resignations on behalf of [SPC].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Officers' last day was April 20; Rathje and Persson acknowledge payment in full up to that date and Sj&#246;str&#246;m acknowledges payment in full to April 30. They filed this lawsuit seeking payment for the termination periods provided for in their contracts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the Officers were replaced, SPC discovered various problems with the up-keep of the ship including damage to the wood. SPC alleged that the Officers were responsible, and cross-claimed for more than one million dollars. The bench trial was held on February 11-15, 2002, and a decision was issued on March 13, 2002. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.

Moore, <i>Moore's Federal Practice</i> &#167; 0.225, at 2701, &#167; 0.230, at 2783 (2d ed.1996) (hereinafter <i>Moore's Federal Practice</i>). The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure apply to admiralty cases. Fed. R.Civ.P. 1 (2003). The substantive matter is governed, in hierarchical order, by federal statutes and treaties, general maritime law developed by the Supreme Court, state statutes, and finally common law decisions of the state courts. 1A <i>Moore's Federal Practice</i> &#167; 0.326, at 3233-35. \"State law may supplement maritime law where maritime law is silent ..., but state law may not be applied where it is materially different than maritime law, or where it would defeat the reasonably settled expectations of maritime actors.\" <i>Windsor Mount Joy Mut.

Rathje and Persson</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rathje and Persson appeal from the district court's determination that they resigned and were therefore not entitled to termination pay under their employment contracts. They attack several findings of fact made by the district court, asserting that it was clear error for the court to find that neither Officer (1) could have reasonably believed he was being terminated, (2) could have reasonably believed that he was entitled to severance pay that was not mentioned in his contract, (3) could have reasonably believed that he was relieved from his obligation to give notice to SPC before quitting, and (4) was entitled to termination pay. We find that the district court's findings are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the record shows that Rathje and Persson wrote to Hudson, acknowledging that they were \"fenced-in and protected, meaning that nobody could touch our contracts.\" Their claim that Hudson effectively terminated them by contracting with ISP (whose numbers showed their pay reduced by thirty percent) thus fails because the Officers understood that their contracts were unalterable. The Officers never sought clarification from Hudson, the chairman, about ISP's new role, and Hudson never told the Officers anything to suggest that their contracts were not protected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As evidence of their mindset at the time and support for their belief that they, too, were being terminated, Rathje and Persson point to the fact that several other long-time employees were fired by Hudson. This is not persuasive, however, because none of the other employees were fired by email message, and Hudson had reassured Rathje and Persson both orally and in writing that their contracts were secure. The record shows that the Officers were treated differently than other employees. It was therefore not clearly erroneous for the district court to find that Rathje and Persson could not reasonably believe that they were implicitly terminated by email message.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, while Hudson mentioned to Rathje and Persson that it would be good for them to \"know about\" a severance plan for employees, he did not specifically state that it applied to them. Each officer had a written contract stating \"I cannot claim any additional benefits or wages of any kind (except) those which have been provided in this contract.\" It was therefore not clear error for the district court to find that Rathje and Persson could not have reasonably believed that they were entitled to a newly-introduced extrinsic severance package.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, it was not clear error for the district court to find that Rathje and Persson's belief that they did not have to give notice because Hudson offered to pay them \"ex gratia\" was irrelevant to the breach of employment contract. The court found that any offer by Hudson (discussed in greater detail in Part (III)(C), below) was made <i>after</i> the Officers resigned; therefore, it was too late for Rathje or Persson to give notice in order to comply with his employment contract. It is irrelevant whether the Officers no longer believed they had to give notice &#8212; they were no longer entitled to give notice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, it was not clearly erroneous for the court to determine that Rathje and Persson were not entitled to termination pay because they were unwilling to work their notice period. The record shows that Rathje and Persson presented an ultimatum to Hudson &#8212; that he either cancel his (binding) contract with ISP or the Officers would leave the ship. It was plausible for the court to find that Rathje and Persson were threatening to quit immediately and not simply giving notice of their resignations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To summarize, we affirm the district court's factual determinations that Rathje and Persson resigned without giving notice and are therefore not entitled to damages because the findings are plausible in light of the evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>CEH, Inc. v.

Sj&#246;str&#246;m was not a party to the contract between Plus 2 and SPC, and that contract did not supersede his employment contract with POF (which was later assumed by SPC).

Thus, they assert that SPC is in breach and liable for damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Officers contend that the court improperly excluded evidence of this new contract as an inadmissible offer of settlement. They maintain that the district court should have read their complaint broadly to incorporate two claims &#8212; one for breach of employment contract, and one for a separate contract formed after employment had ceased. SPC argues that the district court <i>did</i> consider both arguments, and implicitly found that no new contract was formed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>1.

At trial, the court stated that it was \"clear that this is a claim of breach of an employment contract.\" The district court admitted the above email messages only \"for the purpose of completeness of the story of the parties' ongoing dealings rather than as proof of SPC's liability for, or the invalidity of, a claim or its amount.\" <i>Rathje,</i> at *8, n. 13, 15, 16, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2002</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. Dist.

In its conclusions of law, the court considered Hudson's email messages offering termination pay only for their potential effect on a breach of employment claim by the Officers &#8212; and found that there was no effect because the employment had already ceased when the statements were made. <i>Id.</i> at *14, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2002</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. Dist. LEXIS</span> <span class=\"page\">4078</span></span> at *45-46. It is therefore clear that the court read the complaint only to incorporate a breach of employment claim, and not to also include a breach of a separate contract between the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>2.

A complaint must include \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief\" and \"a demand for judgment for the relief the pleader seeks.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a). This simplified pleading standard must \"give the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff's claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\" <i>Conley v. Gibson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105573\"><a href=\"/opinion/105573/conley-v-gibson/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 47, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105573\"><a href=\"/opinion/105573/conley-v-gibson/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span> (1957). A breach of contract complaint must allege (1) the existence of a valid and binding contract; (2) that plaintiff has complied with the contract and performed his own obligations under it; and (3) breach of the contract causing damages. 5 Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> &#167; 1235, at 268-70 (2d ed.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Officers claim that the following language identifies a claim for breach of a separate contract:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he plaintiffs conferred by facsimile and/or emails on several occasions resulting in the wrongful termination of plaintiffs. <i>In any event,</i> defendants agreed that plaintiff's last day of work would be April 20, 2001 and that they would be paid their wages, vacation days and time off in accordance with their contracts for that period of time that there was to be a notice of termination as stated in their contracts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the Officers' complaint clearly establishes a breach of employment contract claim, it fails to set forth the basic elements to show that a separate contract was formed by the parties after conclusion of the employment relationship. The complaint states that \"defendants agreed\" that plaintiffs would work two weeks and be paid their notice of termination period but does not explain how this agreement arose, whether it was a binding contract, whether plaintiffs performed under the contract, and whether defendants breached the contract. It therefore is insufficient to establish a claim for breach of a subsequent contract. The district court properly read the complaint to only include a breach of employment contract claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>D. Maintenance Cross-Appeal</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, SPC appeals the decision that the Officers were not liable for negligent maintenance of the vessel. There was conflicting testimony about the extent or existence of damage to the vessel, and the court found only that SPC may incur additional cost as a result of negligent maintenance of the wood railings, doors, and deck. There is nothing to suggest that the district court's findings as to upkeep were clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is unclear whether SPC attempts to make a breach of employment contract claim, a fiduciary duty claim, or a negligence claim, but it is irrelevant because each claim is meritless. Nothing in the Officers' employment contracts mentions upkeep of the vessel, no testimony suggested that the Officers were required to maintain the vessel, and the record is absent of any discussion by the parties regarding any such duty. The breach of employment contract therefore fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both a breach of fiduciary duty and negligence claim are predicated upon a duty owed by the Officers to the ship owner. Here, however, SPC claims only to be the operator of the SCOTIA PRINCE. It introduced no evidence to show that it owned the vessel and, in fact, the record shows the owner to be Transworld Steamship Company (Panama), Inc. Even if SPC were somehow analogous to an owner, SPC's claim for negligent maintenance would fail. While a seaman has a duty to perform the duties of his position with diligence, faithfulness, and reasonable skill, <i>see generally</i> 2 Norton, <i>The Law of Seaman</i> &#167; 25.16 (4th ed.1985), SPC has not shown that any of the Officers were responsible for maintaining the woodwork on the vessel. There is no authority in the lengthy history of admiralty cases to support the position that, on these facts, the Officers can be held liable (under a fiduciary or negligence theory) to the owner of the vessel for non-intentional negligent maintenance, and we refuse to establish such jurisprudence here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.
