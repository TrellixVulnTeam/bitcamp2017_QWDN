Reginald C. Lindsay, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                      Boudin, Wallace* and Howard,\n                            Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Christopher Goddu for appellant.\n     Kelly Begg Lawrence, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                           February 2, 2009\n\n\n\n\n*\n    Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f            HOWARD, Circuit Judge.           A jury convicted Andrew Lewis of\n\none count of receipt of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\nÂ§ 2252(a)(2), in connection with ten videos found on his home\n\ncomputer.      Lewis now argues that the evidence was insufficient to\n\nconvict him, pointing in particular to the \"interstate commerce\"\n\nelement of the crime and claiming that the government presented no\n\nevidence to satisfy this element.              Ultimately, two of our prior\n\ncases, United States v. Carroll, 105 F.3d 740 (1st Cir. 1997) and\n\nUnited States v. Hilton, 257 F.3d 50 (1st Cir. 2001), lead us to\n\nreject Lewis' argument.        Accordingly, we affirm.\n\n                                      I. Facts\n\n            Andrew    Lewis    came    to    the   attention   of   federal   law\n\nenforcement      in   connection      with     some   \"inappropriate\"    images\n\ndiscovered on a computer on the grounds of the Salem Maritime\n\nNational Historic Site, where Lewis worked as a United States Park\n\nRanger.1    He was later indicted for receipt of child pornography in\n\nconnection     with   other    videos    he    admitted   downloading    to   his\n\ncomputer at home.\n\n            Forensic analysis of Lewis's home computer revealed that\n\nthe   videos    had   likely   been     downloaded    using    Lewis's   Comcast\n\nInternet connection and a peer-to-peer file-sharing application\n\n\n\n1\n    These images and the computers at the National Historic Site\nform no part of the basis for the indictment, and they were not\nintroduced or referred to at trial.    We mention them merely to\nexplain the genesis of the investigation that yielded the videos.\n\n                                        -2-\n\fcalled LimeWire.       The government presented expert testimony about\n\nLewis's computer and the software; the expert witness conceded on\n\ncross-examination that it is possible a given file transfer made\n\nusing LimeWire might have been conducted entirely within the\n\nborders of one state.\n\n           The government sought, and Lewis objected to, a jury\n\ninstruction that stated, \"If you find that the video images were\n\ntransmitted or received over the Internet, that is sufficient to\n\nfind that the images moved or traveled in interstate or foreign\n\ncommerce.\"   The district court agreed with the government and gave\n\na substantially similar instruction: \"An image has been shipped or\n\ntransported in interstate commerce if it has been transmitted over\n\nthe   Internet.\"        Lewis   objected      both    before   and   after   the\n\ninstruction was given.\n\n           The jury asked one question of the district court during\n\nits deliberations:      \"If a file is transported exclusively within a\n\nsingle   state    on   the   Internet,   is    that    considered    interstate\n\ncommerce?\"       After consultation, and over further objection by\n\nLewis, the district court answered the question in the affirmative.\n\nA little more than one hour later, the jury returned its guilty\n\nverdict.\n\n                                A.   Background\n\n           To place the issue in context, we present some background\n\nabout the Internet and LimeWire. The government's expert testified\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fto much of this information.    We refer to the fact-finding of other\n\ncourts for the rest.\n\n                             1. The Internet\n\n           \"The   Internet     is    an    international        network   of\n\ninterconnected computers.\" Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844, 849 (1997).\n\nInternet   communication   relies    on   TCP/IP,2   \"a   set   of   standard\n\noperating and transmission protocols that structure the Internet's\n\noperation.\"   In re Doubleclick Privacy Litigation, 154 F. Supp. 2d\n\n497, 501 (S.D.N.Y. 2001). Any message or file to be transmitted is\n\nbroken into smaller pieces, called packets.          \"Each packet contains\n\nthe Internet Protocol ('IP') address of the destination . . . , a\n\nsmall portion of data from the original document, and an indication\n\nof the data's place in the original document.\"            Id.   The packets\n\nare routed along the web-like network of interconnected computers.\n\n\"Not all packets from the same transmission necessarily follow the\n\nsame path.\"   Sightsound.com, Inc., 185 F. Supp. 2d at 461.            Along\n\nthe way, computers called routers determine the shortest-in-time\n\nroute for each packet from source to destination.               Each packet\n\ntherefore takes a stepping-stone path through the network of\n\nconnected computers, subject to re-routing along the way if there\n\n2\n    TCP/IP stands for \"Transmission Control Protocol / Internet\nProtocol.\" Resonate, Inc. v. Alteon Websystems, Inc., 338 F.3d\n1360, 1362 n.1 (Fed. Cir. 2003). Transmission Control Protocol\ngoverns the disassembly of a file into packets as well as the re-\nassembly of packets into a file; Internet Protocol governs the\nrouting of those packets from the source computer to their\ndestination. Sightsound.com, Inc. v. N2K, Inc., 185 F. Supp. 2d\n445, 461 (W.D. Pa. 2002).\n\n                                    -4-\n\fis congestion, an outage, or any other error in any part of the\n\npath.\n\n            At the destination computer, the packets are re-assembled\n\naccording to instructions they contain into the original file or\n\nmessage.    If any packets are missing, the destination computer may\n\nrequest they be re-sent from the source computer.        Doubleclick\n\nPrivacy Litigation, 154 F. Supp. 2d at 502.      All of this can now\n\noccur fast enough to enable a viewer to watch live video from the\n\nother side of the planet. \"Dynamic routing,\" as the process is\n\nknown, makes the Internet extraordinarily robust, because the path\n\nbetween two computers is able to adapt to changing conditions on\n\nthe network and thereby avoid areas of outage, congestion or other\n\nproblems.    Dynamic routing, however, also obscures the exact path\n\na piece of data would likely take, or have taken, from one computer\n\nto another. For the purposes of determining whether a transmission\n\nhas taken place across state lines, this difficulty is compounded\n\nbecause transmission along any single \"segment\" of wire or fiber-\n\noptic cable is so fast that the actual distance of the packet's\n\njourney is much less important in computing the total travel time\n\nthan are network congestion, the number of \"hops\" the packet takes\n\nand other factors.    Simply put, it is impossible to say with any\n\ncertainty that a given packet will take the shortest route in\n\ndistance; the routers search for the shortest route in time.\n\nFurther compounding this problem, the network itself was not\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\festablished    with   state   boundaries   in   mind,   nor     does   it   even\n\nrecognize them.    \"The Internet is wholly insensitive to geographic\n\ndistinctions.\"     Am. Libraries Ass'n v. Pataki, 969 F. Supp. 160,\n\n170 (S.D.N.Y. 1997).\n\n                                2. LimeWire\n\n             LimeWire is a peer-to-peer file sharing application that\n\nconnects users who wish to share data files with one another.3\n\nAlthough the Supreme Court has defined \"peer-to-peer\" networks as\n\nthose in which \"users' computers communicate directly with each\n\nother, not through central servers,\" Grokster, 545 U.S. at 919-20,\n\nin this context such a description may be misleading.                  While a\n\ncentral server is not needed to coordinate file transfers made\n\nthrough LimeWire, the transfer is still subject to the dynamic\n\nrouting associated with the underlying TCP/IP protocol. This means\n\nthat   the   so-called   \"direct   connection\"    is    still    mediated     by\n\nwhatever stops each of the packets might make on its journey from\n\nsource to destination.\n\n             LimeWire and the Gnutella network are indifferent to the\n\nnature of the data -- images or text or music or video or software.\n\n\n3\n   LimeWire is also the name sometimes used for the collection of\ncomputers running the application LimeWire and for the central Web\nsite where the LimeWire application can be downloaded for free. It\nis also sometimes used to describe the protocol by which that\nnetwork operates, although the protocol is properly known as the\n\"Gnutella\" network. This network is the one used by the Streamcast\nsoftware at issue in MGM Studios v. Grokster, Ltd., 545 U.S. 913,\n921 (2005).      We use \"LimeWire\" to refer to the software\napplication.\n\n                                    -6-\n\fThey are equally indifferent to the legal status of the data --\n\npublic-domain or copyrighted or contraband.\n\n          LimeWire combines two functions: the ability to search\n\nfor and download files from other users, and the ability to make\n\nfiles on one's own computer available to other users.      A brief\n\nsketch of the mechanics of these functions will frame the evidence\n\npresented at Lewis's trial.\n\n                    a. Sharing One's Own Files\n\n          When it is first installed, LimeWire creates a folder\n\nnamed \"Shared\" on the user's computer. By default, any file placed\n\nin that \"Shared\" folder is available to anyone else on the Internet\n\nwho uses the LimeWire application.    Also by default, any file a\n\nuser downloads through LimeWire is automatically placed in that\n\n\"Shared\" folder and is therefore offered by that user for further\n\ndownloads by other users.   These default behaviors can be changed\n\nby the user:   a user could turn off sharing altogether, designate\n\nanother folder with a different name to serve as the \"Shared\"\n\nfolder, manually remove files from the \"Shared\" folder (or whatever\n\nfolder had been designated) and prevent them from being shared on\n\nan individual basis.\n\n      b. Searching For and Downloading the Files of Others\n\n          To download files from other users, a user launches\n\nLimeWire and inputs a search term or terms.   The application then\n\nseeks matches for those terms in the file names and descriptions of\n\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fall files designated for sharing on all computers then running the\n\nLimeWire application (or any other application using the Gnutella\n\nnetwork). The application displays a list of file names that match\n\nthe search terms, and the user can select one or more of those to\n\nbegin downloading the files.\n\n                          II. Discussion\n\n          We note at the outset that Lewis's appeal is from the\n\ndenial of his Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal.   To succeed\n\nin this claim he must establish that no reasonable jury could have\n\nconvicted him of the charged crime based on the evidence presented.\n\nUnited States v. Wilder, 526 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2008).   He trains\n\nhis sights only on the interstate commerce element of the statute,\n\nhowever, conceding for the purposes of this appeal that the other\n\nelements were met.\n\n          Lewis was convicted of one count of receiving child\n\npornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. Â§ 2252(a)(2).4          It is\n\n\n4\n    That provision reads:\n          Â§ 2252.     Certain activities relating to\n          material involving the sexual exploitation of\n          minors\n          (a) Any person who--\n           . . . .\n             (2) knowingly receives, or distributes any\n          visual depiction that has been mailed, or has\n          been shipped or transported in interstate or\n          foreign commerce, or which contains materials\n          which have been mailed or so shipped or\n          transported, by any means including by\n          computer, or knowingly reproduces any visual\n          depiction for distribution in interstate or\n          foreign commerce by any means including by\n\n                               -8-\n\fundisputed that Lewis knowingly possessed video files of child\n\npornography, and that he procured those files using his computer,\n\nthe Internet and LimeWire.           The sole question is whether the\n\ngovernment met its burden to prove that the videos had been\n\n\"shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\"5\n\n          The government introduced evidence, and Lewis did not\n\ncontest, that he downloaded the images using the Internet.               Lewis,\n\nhowever, contends that Â§ 2252(a)(2) requires the actual shipment or\n\ncommunications    of     the   images     across   state    lines.     And,    he\n\ncontinues, the mere fact that he used the Internet is insufficient\n\nto prove the images crossed state lines.\n\n          The     government      first       challenges    Lewis's   operating\n\nassumption   --   that    Â§    2252(a)(2)      requires    actual   shipment   or\n\ncommunication of the images across state lines.                 The government\n\nmakes two distinct arguments.             First, it argues that no actual\n\ncrossing of a state or national border is necessary -- the statute\n\nshould be read, the government says, to require only transmission\n\n\n          computer or through the mails, if--\n                 (A)   t h e producing of such visual\n          depiction involves the use of a minor engaging\n          in sexually explicit conduct; and\n                 (B) such visual depiction is of such\n          conduct . . . .\n\n          shall be punished as provided in subsection\n          (b) of this section.\n18 U.S.C. Â§ 2252(a)(2).\n5\n    No evidence was presented and no argument was made concerning\nthe \"materials containing\" prong of the statute, and we do not\nconsider it further.\n\n                                        -9-\n\for shipment in the \"stream\" or \"flow\" of commerce.               Second, the\n\ngovernment argues that even if the statute incorporates a general\n\nrequirement of actual interstate movement, transmission or shipment\n\nby computer should be considered differently than other kinds of\n\nshipment or transmission.      In that medium, the government argues,\n\nthe jurisdictional requirement of the statute should be relaxed.\n\nWe find neither argument convincing.\n\n           In making its first argument -- that the statute does not\n\nrequire proof of actual shipment or communication across a border\n\n-- the government contends that Congress intended to reach purely\n\nintrastate transmission of child pornography that used a channel or\n\ninstrumentality of interstate commerce.          But this is not what the\n\nstatute says.     \"Congress uses different modifiers to the word\n\n'commerce' in the design and enactment of its statutes.\"               Circuit\n\nCity Stores v. Adams, 532 U.S. 105, 115 (2001).                 \"[T]he 'word\n\n\"involving,\"    like    \"affecting,\"   signals    an   intent   to    exercise\n\nCongress' commerce power to the full.'             Unlike those phrases,\n\nhowever, the general words 'in commerce' and the specific phrase\n\n'engaged in commerce' are understood to have a more limited reach.\"\n\nId. (quoting Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson, 513 U.S. 265,\n\n277 (1995)).\n\n           Perhaps just as important, the government's argument here\n\nwould   prove   too    much.   Previous   cases    treated      the   parallel\n\njurisdictional requirements of Â§ 2252(a) as requiring some actual\n\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fmovement across state lines.6         See United States v. Robinson, 137\n\nF.3d   652,   653    (1st   Cir.   1998)   (upholding   conviction   under   Â§\n\n2252(a)(4) and mentioning specifically that \"the fifty photographs\n\nwere all taken using a Kodak instant camera and Kodak instant film,\n\nboth of which were manufactured by the Eastman Kodak Company\n\noutside of Massachusetts\"); see also United States v. Smith, 459\n\nF.3d 1276, 1282 (11th Cir. 2006) (relying on proof that materials\n\nhad    actually     crossed   state   lines   to   satisfy   jurisdictional\n\nelement). Similarly, this court has held that intent to ship child\n\npornography across state lines is not required for a conviction\n\nunder Â§ 2251, which contains the same language.            Barber v. United\n\nStates, 1993 U.S. App. LEXIS 21198, at *4-*5 (1st Cir. Aug. 23,\n\n1993) (unpublished opinion) (per curiam).           That case concerned a\n\n\n6\n     The relevant language in Â§ 2252(a)(4)(B) criminalizes the\npossession of \"[one] or more books, magazines, periodicals, films,\nvideo tapes, or other matter which contain any visual depiction\nthat has been mailed, or has been shipped or transported in\ninterstate or foreign commerce, or which was produced using\nmaterials which have been mailed or so shipped or transported, by\nany means including by computer\" provided the depiction is of\nsexually explicit conduct by a minor and the depiction was created\ninvolving the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.\nThus, Â§ 2252(a)(4)(B) allows the jurisdictional element to be\nsatisfied in two ways: either the depiction has been \"mailed, or\nhas been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce\"\nor else it has been \"produced using materials which have been\nmailed or so shipped or transported.\" Id. The same jurisdictional\nlanguage appears in Â§ 2252A(a)(3),(5) and (6). The syntax of these\ntwo requirements compels us to read them as meaning the same thing\nby   \"shipped or transported.\"    Section 2252(a)(2), under which\nLewis was convicted, does not include this second \"produced using\nmaterials\" prong, but interpretation of \"shipped or transported in\ninterstate commerce\" in that prong sheds light on its meaning in\nthe first.\n\n                                      -11-\n\fdefendant who admitted mailing undeveloped film to an address in\n\nMassachusetts for developing, but he denied intending or knowing\n\nthat the film would thence be forwarded to Virginia.             We held that\n\nactual interstate transportation, without intent, satisfied the\n\nstatute.     This     holding   would   have     been   unnecessary,      indeed\n\nnonsensical, if no crossing of state lines need have been shown at\n\nall -- the defendant admitted mailing the images intrastate and\n\nhaving done so intentionally.           Id.     \"Shipped or transported in\n\ninterstate commerce\" here must require interstate movement.\n\n            The interstate commerce requirement at issue here is like\n\nthat of many other criminal statutes.           See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. Â§ 1343\n\n(\"Whoever . . . transmits or causes to be transmitted by means of\n\nwire, radio, or television communication in interstate or foreign\n\ncommerce [the relevant materials shall be guilty of a crime].\");\n\nId. Â§ 2314 (subjecting to criminal liability \"[w]hoever transports,\n\ntransmits, or transfers in interstate or foreign commerce\" the\n\nitems subject to the statute).          These provisions, too, have long\n\nbeen held to require actual crossing of a state or national border.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Potter, 463 F.3d 9, 16 (1st Cir. 2006)\n\n(relying on \"interstate faxes\" to satisfy one element of Â§ 1343);\n\nUnited States v. Cassiere, 4 F.3d 1006, 1011 (1st Cir. 1993)\n\n(elements    of   Â§   1343   include     \"the    use    of   interstate    wire\n\ncommunications\"); Efron v. Embassy Suites (P.R.), Inc., 47 F. Supp.\n\n2d 200, 205 (D.P.R. 1999) (dismissing wire fraud charges because\n\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\f\"none of these facsimile transmissions [were] alleged to have\n\ntraveled on interstate phone lines, a necessary component of the\n\nactus reus needed for indictment under the wire fraud statute\");\n\nFirst Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions, Â§ 4.20 (actual interstate\n\nmovement required for Â§ 2314). The government, then, cannot excise\n\ncompletely the requirement that the child pornography cross a state\n\nor national border.    To hold otherwise would do violence to the\n\nplain language of the statute and fly in the face of practice,\n\nincluding that of the government itself, with regard to this and a\n\nhost of similarly worded statutes.\n\n           The government's second argument attempts to create a\n\ndistinction between items that are \"shipped or transported\" using\n\na computer, and those that are \"shipped or transported\" using other\n\nmeans.   While we concede that it is possible Congress meant to make\n\npurely intrastate transmission by computer of these materials into\n\na federal crime, by the plain language of the statute, it did not\n\ndo so.    We are therefore constrained from altering the statute\n\nbased on our assumptions about what Congress wanted.\n\n           Congress added the words \"by any means including by\n\ncomputer\" to the statute in 1988.      Nov. 18, 1988, P.L. 100-690,\n\nTitle VII, Subtitle N, Ch 1, Â§ 7511(b), 102 Stat. 4485.   The clause\n\ndoes evince a particular concern with computer transmission of\n\nchild pornography, but its placement -- modifying \"has been shipped\n\nor transported . . . in interstate commerce\" cannot indicate that\n\n\n\n                                -13-\n\fspecial rules apply to computer shipment or transmission.                  The\n\nplain language of the statute indicates that we are to treat\n\nshipment or transmission by computer the same way we would shipment\n\nor   transmission   by   any   other   means.    While    the    government's\n\nargument may be sensitive to Congress's actual desires in altering\n\nthe statute, we must be bound by what Congress wrote, not what it\n\nwanted. We \"must presume that a legislature says in a statute what\n\nit means and means in a statute what it says there.             When the words\n\nof a statute are unambiguous, then, this first canon is also the\n\nlast: judicial inquiry is complete.\"        Conn. Nat'l Bank v. Germain,\n\n503 U.S. 249, 253-54 (1992) (internal quotation marks and citations\n\nomitted).\n\n            Having concluded that Â§ 2252(a)(2) does require that the\n\ngovernment prove actual interstate transmission or shipment of the\n\nimages, we turn to the government's next argument -- that it proved\n\ninterstate    transmission     occurred    in   this     case    because   the\n\nprosecution introduced evidence that Lewis used the Internet.7              In\n\nsupport of this argument the government cites two of our prior\n\ncases, Carroll and Hilton.       After close review of the holdings in\n\n\n7\n     We do not consider the question of whether Congress has\nsufficient power under the Commerce Clause to regulate the\nintrastate transmission of child pornography. We have upheld the\nstatute at issue under the Commerce Clause, and the parties here do\nnot dispute that result. United States v. Morales-De Jesus, 372\nF.3d 6, 17 (1st Cir. 2004); see also Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1,\n9 (2005) (upholding Congress's power to regulate intrastate,\nnoncommercial activity that in the aggregate affects interstate\ncommerce that Congress has determined to proscribe).\n\n                                   -14-\n\fthese cases, we agree with the government that Lewis' sufficiency\n\nclaim must fail.\n\n                In Carroll, 105 F.3d 740, we addressed whether there was\n\nsufficient evidence to convict the defendant of violating 18 U.S.C.\n\nÂ§ 2251(a) which criminalizes the production of child pornography,\n\n\"if such person knows or has reason to know that such visual\n\ndepiction will be transported in interstate or foreign commerce by\n\nany means, including by computer.\"               We cited three different ways\n\nthe government had satisfied the interstate transmission element of\n\nthe statute.         One of them was by presenting evidence that the\n\ndefendant planned to use the photographs he took as illustrations\n\nfor   a    \"dating     service\"    site    on        the   Internet.             We   wrote,\n\n\"[t]ransmission       of       photographs      by    means     of    the    Internet      is\n\ntantamount to moving photographs across state lines and thus\n\nconstitutes transportation in interstate commerce.\"                              Id. at 742\n\n(citation omitted).\n\n                The second case the government cites is United States v.\n\nHilton, 257 F.3d 50 (1st Cir. 2001).                  That case concerned whether\n\nthere     was     sufficient    evidence     to       convict    the        defendant      of\n\npossessing        child    pornography     in     violation          of     18    U.S.C.    Â§\n\n2252A(a)(5)(B).           In addressing the defendant's argument that the\n\ngovernment failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the\n\nimages he possessed traveled in interstate commerce, we cited\n\nCarroll and held that \"[u]nder the case law, proof of transmission\n\n\n\n                                         -15-\n\fof pornography over the Internet or over telephone lines satisfies\n\nthe interstate commerce element of the offense.\"              Id. at 54.\n\n            In   light   of   these   two    cases,   we   conclude   that   the\n\ngovernment proved the images traveled interstate when it introduced\n\nevidence that Lewis received images that were transmitted over the\n\nInternet.\n\n            We are not alone in holding that the government may\n\nsatisfy the interstate commerce element by proving that child\n\npornography images were transmitted over the Internet.                Two other\n\ncircuits, citing Carroll, have reached the same conclusion.                   In\n\nUnited States v. Runyan, 290 F.3d 223, 239 (5th Cir. 2002), the\n\nFifth Circuit, quoting Carroll, held that proof of use of the\n\nInternet was sufficient to find the interstate commerce element of\n\nÂ§ 2251(a) satisfied.          Runyan, 290 F.3d at 239.         And the Third\n\nCircuit similarly quoted Carroll as supporting its holding that Â§\n\n2252(a)(2)'s interstate commerce element was satisfied by the\n\ndefendant's use of the Internet.             United States v. MacEwan, 445\n\nF.3d 237, 244 (3d Cir. 2006) (\"because of the very interstate\n\nnature of the Internet, once a user submits a connection request to\n\na website server or an image is transmitted from the website server\n\nback to the user the data has traveled in interstate commerce\").8\n\n8\n    See also United States v. White, 2 Fed. App'x. 295, 298 (4th\nCir. 2001) (unpublished opinion) (quoting Carroll in its holding\nthat use of the Internet is transportation in interstate commerce);\nUnited States v. Smith, 47 M.J. 588, 592 (N-M. Ct. Crim. App. 1997)\n(\"[W]e hold that the transmission of information in 'cyberspace'\nwould constitute a transportation in interstate commerce.\")\n\n                                      -16-\n\f          Lewis makes a fair attempt at distinguishing both Carroll\n\nand Hilton from this case. With respect to Carroll, he makes three\n\narguments.   First, he notes that our holding in Carroll that\n\n\"[t]ransmission of photographs by means of the Internet . . .\n\nconstitutes transportation in interstate commerce\" was supported\n\nwith citations to two other cases -- United States v. Thomas, 74\n\nF.3d 701, 706-07 (6th Cir. 1996) and United States v. Maxwell, 42\n\nM.J. 568, 580 (U.S.A.F.C.A. 1995).    Our holding then, he argues,\n\nmust be interpreted through the lens of those cases, and neither of\n\nthem stands for the broad proposition we attributed to them.\n\nNevertheless, even if we were to accept Lewis' argument that we\n\nwere overly generous in our reading of Thomas and Maxwell, that\n\ndoes not change the binding conclusion we reached in Carroll.\n\nNext, Lewis contends that, unlike the defendant in Carroll, he\n\nobjected to the interstate commerce element at trial.      Although\n\nthis may be true, we fail to see how this factual distinction\n\nundermines the applicability of Carroll in any respect.    As it is\n\nin this case, in Carroll our attention was squarely trained on\n\nwhether the government introduced evidence sufficient to satisfy\n\nthe statute's interstate commerce element.    Finally, Lewis argues\n\nthat, unlike in this case, in Carroll there was other, \"substantial\n\nevidence\" of interstate movement.       True, we identified other\n\ngrounds for our holding in Carroll.   For example, we noted that the\n\n\n\n(relying also on Carroll).\n\n                               -17-\n\fdefendant told an individual that he intended to take film across\n\nstate lines.           Carroll, 105 F.3d at 742.                         Nevertheless, that\n\nalternative grounds existed for our holding fails to detract from\n\nour express conclusion that the use of the internet in that case\n\nwas enough, standing alone, to satisfy the jurisdictional element.\n\nSee id.\n\n            Lewis's attack on the Hilton decision is even less\n\nconvincing.        He essentially attacks that case for not reading\n\nCarroll as he does.           As developed above, Lewis' interpretation of\n\nCarroll    is    overly      narrow.        Although           we   could       accept     Lewis'\n\ninvitation to construe the Carroll and Hilton decisions as he does,\n\nto do so would be disingenuous.\n\n            For    the       sake    of    completeness,            we    should     note    that\n\nCongress recently amended the child pornography statutes, including\n\nthe one before us, to expand the jurisdictional coverage.                                  It did\n\nso by replacing all instances of \"in interstate\" with \"in or\n\naffecting       interstate\"         commerce.           Effective        Child      Pornography\n\nProsecution      Act    of    2007,       Pub.    L.     No.    110-358,        Â§   103.      The\n\nlegislative      history      indicates          that    Congress         was    unhappy     with\n\ncircuit court decisions narrowly construing the prior statute and\n\nwanted to put issues like ours to rest.                    See 153 Cong. Rec. H13591-\n\n92 (daily ed. Nov. 13, 2007) (statement of Rep. Conyers); id. at\n\nH13592    (statement         of   Rep.     Goodlatte).              Despite      these     recent\n\ndevelopments, this case is governed by the statute as written at\n\n\n\n                                            -18-\n\fthe time of Lewis's conduct, and our interpretation rests only on\n\nthe law as it stood at that time.\n\n                         III. Conclusion\n\n            For the reasons stated above, the judgment below is\n\naffirmed.\n\n\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                               -19-\n\f",

Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before BOUDIN, WALLACE<sup>[*]</sup> and HOWARD, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>HOWARD, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>A jury convicted Andrew Lewis of one count of receipt of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. Â§ 2252(a)(2), in connection with ten videos found on his home computer. Lewis now argues that the evidence was insufficient to convict him, pointing in particular to the \"interstate commerce\" element of the crime and claiming that the government presented no evidence to satisfy this element. Ultimately, two of our prior cases, <i>United States v. Carroll,</i> 105 F.3d 740 (1st Cir. 1997) and <i>United States v. Hilton,</i> 257 F.3d 50 (1st Cir.2001), lead us to reject Lewis' argument. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Facts</h2>\n<p>Andrew Lewis came to the attention of federal law enforcement in connection with some \"inappropriate\" images discovered on a computer on the grounds of the Salem Maritime National Historic Site, where Lewis worked as a United States Park Ranger.<sup>[1]</sup> He was later indicted for receipt of child pornography in connection with other videos he admitted downloading to his computer at home.</p>\n<p>Forensic analysis of Lewis's home computer revealed that the videos had likely been downloaded using Lewis's Comcast Internet connection and a peer-to-peer file-sharing application called LimeWire. The government presented expert testimony about Lewis's computer and the software; the expert witness conceded on cross-examination that it is possible a given file transfer made using LimeWire might have been conducted entirely within the borders of one state.</p>\n<p>The government sought, and Lewis objected to, a jury instruction that stated, \"If you find that the video images were transmitted or received over the Internet, that is sufficient to find that the images moved or traveled in interstate or foreign commerce.\" The district court agreed with the government and gave a substantially similar instruction: \"An image has been shipped or transported in interstate commerce if it has been transmitted over the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*210</span> Internet.\" Lewis objected both before and after the instruction was given.</p>\n<p>The jury asked one question of the district court during its deliberations: \"If a file is transported exclusively within a single state on the Internet, is that considered interstate commerce?\" After consultation, and over further objection by Lewis, the district court answered the question in the affirmative. A little more than one hour later, the jury returned its guilty verdict.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Background</h2>\n<p>To place the issue in context, we present some background about the Internet and LimeWire. The government's expert testified to much of this information. We refer to the fact-finding of other courts for the rest.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>1. The Internet</i></h2>\n<p>\"The Internet is an international network of interconnected computers.\" <i>Reno v. ACLU,</i> 521 U.S. 844, 849, 117 S.Ct. 2329, 138 L.Ed.2d 874 (1997). Internet communication relies on TCP/IP,<sup>[2]</sup> \"a set of standard operating and transmission protocols that structure the Internet's operation.\" <i>In re DoubleClick Privacy Litigation,</i> 154 F.Supp.2d 497, 501 (S.D.N.Y.2001). Any message or file to be transmitted is broken into smaller pieces, called packets. \"Each packet contains the Internet Protocol (`IP') address of the destination ..., a small portion of data from the original document, and an indication of the data's place in the original document.\" <i>Id.</i> The packets are routed along the web-like network of interconnected computers. \"Not all packets from the same transmission necessarily follow the same path.\" <i>Sightsound.com, Inc.,</i> 185 F.Supp.2d at 461. Along the way, computers called routers determine the shortest-in-time route for each packet from source to destination. Each packet therefore takes a stepping-stone path through the network of connected computers, subject to re-routing along the way if there is congestion, an outage, or any other error in any part of the path.</p>\n<p>At the destination computer, the packets are re-assembled according to instructions they contain into the original file or message. If any packets are missing, the destination computer may request they be resent from the source computer. <i>DoubleClick Privacy Litigation,</i> 154 F.Supp.2d at 502. All of this can now occur fast enough to enable a viewer to watch live video from the other side of the planet. \"Dynamic routing,\" as the process is known, makes the Internet extraordinarily robust, because the path between two computers is able to adapt to changing conditions on the network and thereby avoid areas of outage, congestion or other problems. Dynamic routing, however, also obscures the exact path a piece of data would likely take, or have taken, from one computer to another. For the purposes of determining whether a transmission has taken place across state lines, this difficulty is compounded because transmission along any single \"segment\" of wire or fiber-optic cable is so fast that the actual distance of the packet's journey is much less important in computing the total travel time than are network congestion, the number of \"hops\" the packet takes and other factors. Simply put, it is impossible to say with any <span class=\"star-pagination\">*211</span> certainty that a given packet will take the shortest route in distance; the routers search for the shortest route in time. Further compounding this problem, the network itself was not established with state boundaries in mind, nor does it even recognize them. \"The Internet is wholly insensitive to geographic distinctions.\" <i>Am. Libraries Ass'n v. Pataki,</i> 969 F.Supp. 160, 170 (S.D.N.Y.1997).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>2. LimeWire</i></h2>\n<p>LimeWire is a peer-to-peer file sharing application that connects users who wish to share data files with one another.<sup>[3]</sup> Although the Supreme Court has defined \"peer-to-peer\" networks as those in which \"users' computers communicate directly with each other, not through central servers,\" <i>Grokster,</i> 545 U.S. at 919-20, 125 S.Ct. 2764, in this context such a description may be misleading. While a central server is not needed to coordinate file transfers made through LimeWire, the transfer is still subject to the dynamic routing associated with the underlying TCP/IP protocol. This means that the so-called \"direct connection\" is still mediated by whatever stops each of the packets might make on its journey from source to destination.</p>\n<p>LimeWire and the Gnutella network are indifferent to the nature of the data Â images or text or music or video or software. They are equally indifferent to the legal status of the data Â public-domain or copyrighted or contraband.</p>\n<p>LimeWire combines two functions: the ability to search for and download files from other users, and the ability to make files on one's own computer available to other users. A brief sketch of the mechanics of these functions will frame the evidence presented at Lewis's trial.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>a. Sharing One's Own Files</i></h2>\n<p>When it is first installed, LimeWire creates a folder named \"Shared\" on the user's computer. By default, any file placed in that \"Shared\" folder is available to anyone else on the Internet who uses the LimeWire application. Also by default, any file a user downloads through LimeWire is automatically placed in that \"Shared\" folder and is therefore offered by that user for further downloads by other users. These default behaviors can be changed by the user: a user could turn off sharing altogether, designate another folder with a different name to serve as the \"Shared\" folder, manually remove files from the \"Shared\" folder (or whatever folder had been designated) and prevent them from being shared on an individual basis.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>b. Searching For and Downloading the Files of Others</i></h2>\n<p>To download files from other users, a user launches LimeWire and inputs a search term or terms. The application then seeks matches for those terms in the file names and descriptions of all files designated for sharing on all computers then running the LimeWire application (or any other application using the Gnutella network). The application displays a list of file names that match the search terms, and the user can select one or more of those to begin downloading the files.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*212</span> II. Discussion</h2>\n<p>We note at the outset that Lewis's appeal is from the denial of his Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal. To succeed in this claim he must establish that no reasonable jury could have convicted him of the charged crime based on the evidence presented. <i>United States v. Wilder,</i> 526 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.2008). He trains his sights only on the interstate commerce element of the statute, however, conceding for the purposes of this appeal that the other elements were met.</p>\n<p>Lewis was convicted of one count of receiving child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. Â§ 2252(a)(2).<sup>[4]</sup> It is undisputed that Lewis knowingly possessed video files of child pornography, and that he procured those files using his computer, the Internet and LimeWire. The sole question is whether the government met its burden to prove that the videos had been \"shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\"<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>The government introduced evidence, and Lewis did not contest, that he downloaded the images using the Internet. Lewis, however, contends that Â§ 2252(a)(2) requires the actual shipment or communications of the images across state lines. And, he continues, the mere fact that he used the Internet is insufficient to prove the images crossed state lines.</p>\n<p>The government first challenges Lewis's operating assumption Â that Â§ 2252(a)(2) requires actual shipment or communication of the images across state lines. The government makes two distinct arguments. First, it argues that no actual crossing of a state or national border is necessary Â the statute should be read, the government says, to require only transmission or shipment in the \"stream\" or \"flow\" of commerce. Second, the government argues that even if the statute incorporates a general requirement of actual interstate movement, transmission or shipment by computer should be considered differently than other kinds of shipment or transmission. In that medium, the government argues, the jurisdictional requirement of the statute should be relaxed. We find neither argument convincing.</p>\n<p>In making its first argument Â that the statute does not require proof of actual shipment or communication across a border Â the government contends that Congress intended to reach purely intrastate transmission of child pornography that used a channel or instrumentality of interstate commerce. But this is not what the statute says. \"Congress uses different modifiers to the word `commerce' in the design and enactment of its statutes.\" <i>Circuit City Stores v. Adams,</i> 532 U.S. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*213</span> 105, 115, 121 S.Ct. 1302, 149 L.Ed.2d 234 (2001). \"[T]he `word \"involving,\" like \"affecting,\" signals an intent to exercise Congress' commerce power to the full.' Unlike those phrases, however, the general words `in commerce' and the specific phrase `engaged in commerce' are understood to have a more limited reach.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson,</i> 513 U.S. 265, 277, 115 S.Ct. 834, 130 L.Ed.2d 753 (1995)).</p>\n<p>Perhaps just as important, the government's argument here would prove too much. Previous cases treated the parallel jurisdictional requirements of Â§ 2252(a) as requiring some actual movement across state lines.<sup>[6]</sup><i>See </i><i>United States v. Robinson,</i> 137 F.3d 652, 653 (1st Cir.1998) (upholding conviction under Â§ 2252(a)(4) and mentioning specifically that \"the fifty photographs were all taken using a Kodak instant camera and Kodak instant film, both of which were manufactured by the Eastman Kodak Company outside of Massachusetts\"); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Smith,</i> 459 F.3d 1276, 1282 (11th Cir.2006) (relying on proof that materials had actually crossed state lines to satisfy jurisdictional element). Similarly, this court has held that <i>intent</i> to ship child pornography across state lines is not required for a conviction under Â§ 2251, which contains the same language. <i>Barber v. United States,</i> 1993 WL 318786, at *1-2, 1993 U.S.App. LEXIS 21198, at *4-*5 (1st Cir. Aug. 23, 1993) (unpublished opinion) (per curiam). That case concerned a defendant who admitted mailing undeveloped film to an address in Massachusetts for developing, but he denied intending or knowing that the film would thence be forwarded to Virginia. We held that actual interstate transportation, without intent, satisfied the statute. This holding would have been unnecessary, indeed nonsensical, if no crossing of state lines need have been shown at all Â the defendant admitted mailing the images intrastate and having done so intentionally. <i>Id.</i> \"Shipped or transported in interstate commerce\" here must require interstate movement.</p>\n<p>The interstate commerce requirement at issue here is like that of many other criminal statutes. <i>See, e.g.,</i> 18 U.S.C. Â§ 1343 (\"Whoever ... transmits or causes to be transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television communication in interstate or foreign commerce [the relevant materials shall be guilty of a crime].\"); <i>Id.</i> Â§ 2314 (subjecting to criminal liability \"[w]hoever transports, transmits, or transfers in interstate or foreign commerce\" the items subject to the statute). These provisions, too, have long been held to require actual crossing of a state or national border. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Potter,</i> 463 F.3d 9, 16 (1st Cir.2006) (relying on \"interstate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*214</span> faxes\" to satisfy one element of Â§ 1343); <i>United States v. Cassiere,</i> 4 F.3d 1006, 1011 (1st Cir.1993) (elements of Â§ 1343 include \"the use of interstate wire communications\"); <i>Efron v. Embassy Suites (P.R.), Inc.,</i> 47 F.Supp.2d 200, 205 (D.P.R. 1999) (dismissing wire fraud charges because \"none of these facsimile transmissions [were] alleged to have traveled on interstate phone lines, a necessary component of the <i>actus reus</i> needed for indictment under the wire fraud statute\"); First Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions, Â§ 4.20 (actual interstate movement required for Â§ 2314). The government, then, cannot excise completely the requirement that the child pornography cross a state or national border. To hold otherwise would do violence to the plain language of the statute and fly in the face of practice, including that of the government itself, with regard to this and a host of similarly worded statutes.</p>\n<p>The government's second argument attempts to create a distinction between items that are \"shipped or transported\" using a computer, and those that are \"shipped or transported\" using other means. While we concede that it is possible Congress meant to make purely intrastate transmission by computer of these materials into a federal crime, by the plain language of the statute, it did not do so. We are therefore constrained from altering the statute based on our assumptions about what Congress wanted.</p>\n<p>Congress added the words \"by any means including by computer\" to the statute in 1988. Nov. 18, 1988, P.L. 100-690, Title VII, Subtitle N, Ch 1, Â§ 7511(b), 102 Stat. 4485. The clause does evince a particular concern with computer transmission of child pornography, but its placement Â modifying \"has been shipped or transported ... in interstate commerce\" cannot indicate that special rules apply to computer shipment or transmission. The plain language of the statute indicates that we are to treat shipment or transmission by computer the same way we would shipment or transmission by any other means. While the government's argument may be sensitive to Congress's actual desires in altering the statute, we must be bound by what Congress wrote, not what it wanted. We \"must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there. When the words of a statute are unambiguous, then, this first canon is also the last: judicial inquiry is complete.\" <i>Conn. Nat'l Bank v. Germain,</i> 503 U.S. 249, 253-54, 112 S.Ct. 1146, 117 L.Ed.2d 391 (1992) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p>Having concluded that Â§ 2252(a)(2) <i>does</i> require that the government prove actual interstate transmission or shipment of the images, we turn to the government's next argument Â that it proved interstate transmission occurred in this case because the prosecution introduced evidence that Lewis used the Internet.<sup>[7]</sup> In support of this argument the government cites two of our prior cases, <i>Carroll</i> and <i>Hilton.</i> After close review of the holdings in these cases, we agree with the government that Lewis' sufficiency claim must fail.</p>\n<p>In <i>Carroll,</i> 105 F.3d 740, we addressed whether there was sufficient evidence to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*215</span> convict the defendant of violating 18 U.S.C. Â§ 2251(a) which criminalizes the production of child pornography, \"if such person knows or has reason to know that such visual depiction will be transported in interstate or foreign commerce by any means, including by computer.\" We cited three different ways the government had satisfied the interstate transmission element of the statute. One of them was by presenting evidence that the defendant planned to use the photographs he took as illustrations for a \"dating service\" site on the Internet. We wrote, \"[t]ransmission of photographs by means of the Internet is tantamount to moving photographs across state lines and thus constitutes transportation in interstate commerce.\" <i>Id.</i> at 742 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>The second case the government cites is <i>United States v. Hilton,</i> 257 F.3d 50 (1st Cir.2001). That case concerned whether there was sufficient evidence to convict the defendant of possessing child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. Â§ 2252A(a)(5)(B). In addressing the defendant's argument that the government failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the images he possessed traveled in interstate commerce, we cited <i>Carroll</i> and held that \"[u]nder the case law, proof of transmission of pornography over the Internet or over telephone lines satisfies the interstate commerce element of the offense.\" <i>Id.</i> at 54.</p>\n<p>In light of these two cases, we conclude that the government proved the images traveled interstate when it introduced evidence that Lewis received images that were transmitted over the Internet.</p>\n<p>We are not alone in holding that the government may satisfy the interstate commerce element by proving that child pornography images were transmitted over the Internet. Two other circuits, citing <i>Carroll,</i> have reached the same conclusion. In <i>United States v. Runyan,</i> 290 F.3d 223, 239 (5th Cir.2002), the Fifth Circuit, quoting <i>Carroll,</i> held that proof of use of the Internet was sufficient to find the interstate commerce element of Â§ 2251(a) satisfied. <i>Runyan,</i> 290 F.3d at 239. And the Third Circuit similarly quoted <i>Carroll</i> as supporting its holding that Â§ 2252(a)(2)'s interstate commerce element was satisfied by the defendant's use of the Internet. <i>United States v. MacEwan,</i> 445 F.3d 237, 244 (3d Cir.2006) (\"because of the very interstate nature of the Internet, once a user submits a connection request to a website server or an image is transmitted from the website server back to the user the data has traveled in interstate commerce\").<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>Lewis makes a fair attempt at distinguishing both <i>Carroll</i> and <i>Hilton</i> from this case. With respect to <i>Carroll,</i> he makes three arguments. First, he notes that our holding in <i>Carroll</i> that \"[t]ransmission of photographs by means of the Internet ... constitutes transportation in interstate commerce\" was supported with citations to two other cases Â <i>United States v. Thomas,</i> 74 F.3d 701, 706-07 (6th Cir.1996) and <i>United States v. Maxwell,</i> 42 M.J. 568, 580 (U.S.A.F.C.A.1995). Our holding then, he argues, must be interpreted through the lens of those cases, and neither of them stands for the broad proposition we attributed to them. Nevertheless, even if we were to accept Lewis' argument that we were overly generous in our reading of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*216</span> <i>Thomas</i> and <i>Maxwell,</i> that does not change the binding conclusion we reached in <i>Carroll.</i> Next, Lewis contends that, unlike the defendant in <i>Carroll,</i> he objected to the interstate commerce element at trial. Although this may be true, we fail to see how this factual distinction undermines the applicability of <i>Carroll</i> in any respect. As it is in this case, in <i>Carroll</i> our attention was squarely trained on whether the government introduced evidence sufficient to satisfy the statute's interstate commerce element. Finally, Lewis argues that, unlike in this case, in <i>Carroll</i> there was other, \"substantial evidence\" of interstate movement. True, we identified other grounds for our holding in <i>Carroll.</i> For example, we noted that the defendant told an individual that he intended to take film across state lines. <i>Carroll,</i> 105 F.3d at 742. Nevertheless, that alternative grounds existed for our holding fails to detract from our express conclusion that the use of the internet in that case was enough, standing alone, to satisfy the jurisdictional element. <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p>Lewis's attack on the <i>Hilton</i> decision is even less convincing. He essentially attacks that case for not reading <i>Carroll</i> as he does. As developed above, Lewis' interpretation of <i>Carroll</i> is overly narrow. Although we could accept Lewis' invitation to construe the <i>Carroll</i> and <i>Hilton</i> decisions as he does, to do so would be disingenuous.</p>\n<p>For the sake of completeness, we should note that Congress recently amended the child pornography statutes, including the one before us, to expand the jurisdictional coverage. It did so by replacing all instances of \"in interstate\" with \"in or affecting interstate\" commerce. Effective Child Pornography Prosecution Act of 2007, Pub.L. No. 110-358, Â§ 103. The legislative history indicates that Congress was unhappy with circuit court decisions narrowly construing the prior statute and wanted to put issues like ours to rest. <i>See</i> 153 Cong. Rec. H13591-92 (daily ed. Nov. 13, 2007) (statement of Rep. Conyers); <i>id.</i> at H13592 (statement of Rep. Goodlatte). Despite these recent developments, this case is governed by the statute as written at the time of Lewis's conduct, and our interpretation rests only on the law as it stood at that time.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated above, the judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>AFFIRMED.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  These images and the computers at the National Historic Site form no part of the basis for the indictment, and they were not introduced or referred to at trial. We mention them merely to explain the genesis of the investigation that yielded the videos.</p>\n<p>[2]  TCP/IP stands for \"Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol.\" <i>Resonate, Inc. v. Alteon Websystems, Inc.,</i> 338 F.3d 1360, 1362 n. 1 (Fed.Cir.2003). Transmission Control Protocol governs the disassembly of a file into packets as well as the re-assembly of packets into a file; Internet Protocol governs the routing of those packets from the source computer to their destination. <i>Sightsound.com, Inc. v. N2K, Inc.,</i> 185 F.Supp.2d 445, 461 (W.D.Pa.2002).</p>\n<p>[3]  LimeWire is also the name sometimes used for the collection of computers running the application LimeWire and for the central Web site where the LimeWire application can be downloaded for free. It is also sometimes used to describe the protocol by which that network operates, although the protocol is properly known as the \"Gnutella\" network. This network is the one used by the Streamcast software at issue in <i>MGM Studios v. Grokster, Ltd.,</i> 545 U.S. 913, 921, 125 S.Ct. 2764, 162 L.Ed.2d 781 (2005). We use \"LimeWire\" to refer to the software application.</p>\n<p>[4]  That provision reads:\n</p>\n<p>Â§ 2252. Certain activities relating to material involving the sexual exploitation of minors</p>\n<p>(a) Any person who Â</p>\n<p>. . . .</p>\n<p>(2) knowingly receives, or distributes any visual depiction that has been mailed, or has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce, or which contains materials which have been mailed or so shipped or transported, by any means including by computer, or knowingly reproduces any visual depiction for distribution in interstate or foreign commerce by any means including by computer or through the mails, if Â</p>\n<p>(A) the producing of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct; and</p>\n<p>(B) such visual depiction is of such conduct....</p>\n<p>shall be punished as provided in subsection (b) of this section.</p>\n<p>18 U.S.C. Â§ 2252(a)(2).</p>\n<p>[5]  No evidence was presented and no argument was made concerning the \"materials containing\" prong of the statute, and we do not consider it further.</p>\n<p>[6]  The relevant language in Â§ 2252(a)(4)(B) criminalizes the possession of \"[one] or more books, magazines, periodicals, films, video tapes, or other matter which contain any visual depiction that has been mailed, or has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce, or which was produced using materials which have been mailed or so shipped or transported, by any means including by computer\" provided the depiction is of sexually explicit conduct by a minor and the depiction was created involving the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct. Thus, Â§ 2252(a)(4)(B) allows the jurisdictional element to be satisfied in two ways: either the depiction has been \"mailed, or has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce\" or else it has been \"produced using materials which have been mailed or so shipped or transported.\" <i>Id.</i> The same jurisdictional language appears in Â§ 2252A(a)(3),(5) and (6). The syntax of these two requirements compels us to read them as meaning the same thing by \"shipped or transported.\" Section 2252(a)(2), under which Lewis was convicted, does not include this second \"produced using materials\" prong, but interpretation of \"shipped or transported in interstate commerce\" in that prong sheds light on its meaning in the first.</p>\n<p>[7]  We do not consider the question of whether Congress has sufficient power under the Commerce Clause to regulate the intrastate transmission of child pornography. We have upheld the statute at issue under the Commerce Clause, and the parties here do not dispute that result. <i>United States v. Morales-De Jesus,</i> 372 F.3d 6, 17 (1st Cir.2004); <i>see also </i><i>Gonzales v.

Â§ 2252(a)(2), in connection with ten videos found on his home computer. Lewis now argues that the evidence was insufficient to convict him, pointing in particular to the \"interstate commerce\" element of the crime and claiming that the government presented no evidence to satisfy this element. Ultimately, two of our prior cases, <i>United States v. Carroll,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"734111\"><a href=\"/opinion/734111/united-states-v-christopher-b-carroll/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">740</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1997) and <i>United States v.

Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Facts</h2>\n<p>Andrew Lewis came to the attention of federal law enforcement in connection with some \"inappropriate\" images discovered on a computer on the grounds of the Salem Maritime National Historic Site, where Lewis worked as a United States Park Ranger.<sup>[1]</sup> He was later indicted for receipt of child pornography in connection with other videos he admitted downloading to his computer at home.</p>\n<p>Forensic analysis of Lewis's home computer revealed that the videos had likely been downloaded using Lewis's Comcast Internet connection and a peer-to-peer file-sharing application called LimeWire. The government presented expert testimony about Lewis's computer and the software; the expert witness conceded on cross-examination that it is possible a given file transfer made using LimeWire might have been conducted entirely within the borders of one state.</p>\n<p>The government sought, and Lewis objected to, a jury instruction that stated, \"If you find that the video images were transmitted or received over the Internet, that is sufficient to find that the images moved or traveled in interstate or foreign commerce.\" The district court agreed with the government and gave a substantially similar instruction: \"An image has been shipped or transported in interstate commerce if it has been transmitted over the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*210</span> Internet.\" Lewis objected both before and after the instruction was given.</p>\n<p>The jury asked one question of the district court during its deliberations: \"If a file is transported exclusively within a single state on the Internet, is that considered interstate commerce?\" After consultation, and over further objection by Lewis, the district court answered the question in the affirmative. A little more than one hour later, the jury returned its guilty verdict.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Background</h2>\n<p>To place the issue in context, we present some background about the Internet and LimeWire. The government's expert testified to much of this information. We refer to the fact-finding of other courts for the rest.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>1. The Internet</i></h2>\n<p>\"The Internet is an international network of interconnected computers.\" <i>Reno v. ACLU,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118147\"><a href=\"/opinion/118147/reno-v-american-civil-liberties-union/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">844</span></a></span>, 849, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118147\"><a href=\"/opinion/118147/reno-v-american-civil-liberties-union/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2329</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118147\"><a href=\"/opinion/118147/reno-v-american-civil-liberties-union/\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">874</span></a></span> (1997). Internet communication relies on TCP/IP,<sup>[2]</sup> \"a set of standard operating and transmission protocols that structure the Internet's operation.\" <i>In re DoubleClick Privacy Litigation,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2429654\"><a href=\"/opinion/2429654/in-re-doubleclick-inc-privacy-litigation/\"><span class=\"volume\">154</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">497</span></a></span>, 501 (S.D.N.Y.2001). Any message or file to be transmitted is broken into smaller pieces, called packets. \"Each packet contains the Internet Protocol (`IP') address of the destination ..., a small portion of data from the original document, and an indication of the data's place in the original document.\" <i>Id.</i> The packets are routed along the web-like network of interconnected computers. \"Not all packets from the same transmission necessarily follow the same path.\" <i>Sightsound.com, Inc.,</i> 185 F.Supp.2d at 461. Along the way, computers called routers determine the shortest-in-time route for each packet from source to destination. Each packet therefore takes a stepping-stone path through the network of connected computers, subject to re-routing along the way if there is congestion, an outage, or any other error in any part of the path.</p>\n<p>At the destination computer, the packets are re-assembled according to instructions they contain into the original file or message. If any packets are missing, the destination computer may request they be resent from the source computer. <i>DoubleClick Privacy Litigation,</i> 154 F.Supp.2d at 502. All of this can now occur fast enough to enable a viewer to watch live video from the other side of the planet. \"Dynamic routing,\" as the process is known, makes the Internet extraordinarily robust, because the path between two computers is able to adapt to changing conditions on the network and thereby avoid areas of outage, congestion or other problems. Dynamic routing, however, also obscures the exact path a piece of data would likely take, or have taken, from one computer to another. For the purposes of determining whether a transmission has taken place across state lines, this difficulty is compounded because transmission along any single \"segment\" of wire or fiber-optic cable is so fast that the actual distance of the packet's journey is much less important in computing the total travel time than are network congestion, the number of \"hops\" the packet takes and other factors. Simply put, it is impossible to say with any <span class=\"star-pagination\">*211</span> certainty that a given packet will take the shortest route in distance; the routers search for the shortest route in time. Further compounding this problem, the network itself was not established with state boundaries in mind, nor does it even recognize them. \"The Internet is wholly insensitive to geographic distinctions.\" <i>Am. Libraries Ass'n v. Pataki,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1808497\"><a href=\"/opinion/1808497/american-libraries-assn-v-pataki/\"><span class=\"volume\">969</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">160</span></a></span>, 170 (S.D.N.Y.1997).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>2. LimeWire</i></h2>\n<p>LimeWire is a peer-to-peer file sharing application that connects users who wish to share data files with one another.<sup>[3]</sup> Although the Supreme Court has defined \"peer-to-peer\" networks as those in which \"users' computers communicate directly with each other, not through central servers,\" <i>Grokster,</i> 545 U.S. at 919-20, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799994\"><a href=\"/opinion/799994/metro-goldwyn-mayer-studios-inc-v-grokster-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2764</span></a></span>, in this context such a description may be misleading. While a central server is not needed to coordinate file transfers made through LimeWire, the transfer is still subject to the dynamic routing associated with the underlying TCP/IP protocol. This means that the so-called \"direct connection\" is still mediated by whatever stops each of the packets might make on its journey from source to destination.</p>\n<p>LimeWire and the Gnutella network are indifferent to the nature of the data Â images or text or music or video or software. They are equally indifferent to the legal status of the data Â public-domain or copyrighted or contraband.</p>\n<p>LimeWire combines two functions: the ability to search for and download files from other users, and the ability to make files on one's own computer available to other users. A brief sketch of the mechanics of these functions will frame the evidence presented at Lewis's trial.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>a. Sharing One's Own Files</i></h2>\n<p>When it is first installed, LimeWire creates a folder named \"Shared\" on the user's computer. By default, any file placed in that \"Shared\" folder is available to anyone else on the Internet who uses the LimeWire application. Also by default, any file a user downloads through LimeWire is automatically placed in that \"Shared\" folder and is therefore offered by that user for further downloads by other users. These default behaviors can be changed by the user: a user could turn off sharing altogether, designate another folder with a different name to serve as the \"Shared\" folder, manually remove files from the \"Shared\" folder (or whatever folder had been designated) and prevent them from being shared on an individual basis.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>b. Searching For and Downloading the Files of Others</i></h2>\n<p>To download files from other users, a user launches LimeWire and inputs a search term or terms. The application then seeks matches for those terms in the file names and descriptions of all files designated for sharing on all computers then running the LimeWire application (or any other application using the Gnutella network). The application displays a list of file names that match the search terms, and the user can select one or more of those to begin downloading the files.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*212</span> II. Discussion</h2>\n<p>We note at the outset that Lewis's appeal is from the denial of his Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal. To succeed in this claim he must establish that no reasonable jury could have convicted him of the charged crime based on the evidence presented. <i>United States v. Wilder,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203285\"><a href=\"/opinion/203285/united-states-v-wilder/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir.2008). He trains his sights only on the interstate commerce element of the statute, however, conceding for the purposes of this appeal that the other elements were met.</p>\n<p>Lewis was convicted of one count of receiving child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. Â§ 2252(a)(2).<sup>[4]</sup> It is undisputed that Lewis knowingly possessed video files of child pornography, and that he procured those files using his computer, the Internet and LimeWire. The sole question is whether the government met its burden to prove that the videos had been \"shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\"<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>The government introduced evidence, and Lewis did not contest, that he downloaded the images using the Internet. Lewis, however, contends that Â§ 2252(a)(2) requires the actual shipment or communications of the images across state lines. And, he continues, the mere fact that he used the Internet is insufficient to prove the images crossed state lines.</p>\n<p>The government first challenges Lewis's operating assumption Â that Â§ 2252(a)(2) requires actual shipment or communication of the images across state lines. The government makes two distinct arguments. First, it argues that no actual crossing of a state or national border is necessary Â the statute should be read, the government says, to require only transmission or shipment in the \"stream\" or \"flow\" of commerce. Second, the government argues that even if the statute incorporates a general requirement of actual interstate movement, transmission or shipment by computer should be considered differently than other kinds of shipment or transmission. In that medium, the government argues, the jurisdictional requirement of the statute should be relaxed. We find neither argument convincing.</p>\n<p>In making its first argument Â that the statute does not require proof of actual shipment or communication across a border Â the government contends that Congress intended to reach purely intrastate transmission of child pornography that used a channel or instrumentality of interstate commerce. But this is not what the statute says. \"Congress uses different modifiers to the word `commerce' in the design and enactment of its statutes.\" <i>Circuit City Stores v. Adams,</i> 532 U.S. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*213</span> 105, 115, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118415\"><a href=\"/opinion/118415/circuit-city-stores-inc-v-adams/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">234</span></a></span> (2001). \"[T]he `word \"involving,\" like \"affecting,\" signals an intent to exercise Congress' commerce power to the full.' Unlike those phrases, however, the general words `in commerce' and the specific phrase `engaged in commerce' are understood to have a more limited reach.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117892\"><a href=\"/opinion/117892/allied-bruce-terminix-cos-v-dobson/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></a></span>, 277, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117892\"><a href=\"/opinion/117892/allied-bruce-terminix-cos-v-dobson/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">753</span></a></span> (1995)).</p>\n<p>Perhaps just as important, the government's argument here would prove too much. Previous cases treated the parallel jurisdictional requirements of Â§ 2252(a) as requiring some actual movement across state lines.<sup>[6]</sup><i>See </i><i>United States v. Robinson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197816\"><a href=\"/opinion/197816/united-states-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">652</span></a></span>, 653 (1st Cir.1998) (upholding conviction under Â§ 2252(a)(4) and mentioning specifically that \"the fifty photographs were all taken using a Kodak instant camera and Kodak instant film, both of which were manufactured by the Eastman Kodak Company outside of Massachusetts\"); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Smith,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1276</span></span>, 1282 (11th Cir.2006) (relying on proof that materials had actually crossed state lines to satisfy jurisdictional element). Similarly, this court has held that <i>intent</i> to ship child pornography across state lines is not required for a conviction under Â§ 2251, which contains the same language. <i>Barber v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">318786</span></span>, at *1-2, 1993 U.S.App. LEXIS 21198, at *4-*5 (1st Cir. Aug. 23, 1993) (unpublished opinion) (per curiam). That case concerned a defendant who admitted mailing undeveloped film to an address in Massachusetts for developing, but he denied intending or knowing that the film would thence be forwarded to Virginia. We held that actual interstate transportation, without intent, satisfied the statute. This holding would have been unnecessary, indeed nonsensical, if no crossing of state lines need have been shown at all Â the defendant admitted mailing the images intrastate and having done so intentionally. <i>Id.</i> \"Shipped or transported in interstate commerce\" here must require interstate movement.</p>\n<p>The interstate commerce requirement at issue here is like that of many other criminal statutes. <i>See, e.g.,</i> 18 U.S.C. Â§ 1343 (\"Whoever ... transmits or causes to be transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television communication in interstate or foreign commerce [the relevant materials shall be guilty of a crime].\"); <i>Id.</i> Â§ 2314 (subjecting to criminal liability \"[w]hoever transports, transmits, or transfers in interstate or foreign commerce\" the items subject to the statute). These provisions, too, have long been held to require actual crossing of a state or national border. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span>, 205 (D.P.R. 1999) (dismissing wire fraud charges because \"none of these facsimile transmissions [were] alleged to have traveled on interstate phone lines, a necessary component of the <i>actus reus</i> needed for indictment under the wire fraud statute\"); First Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions, Â§ 4.20 (actual interstate movement required for Â§ 2314). The government, then, cannot excise completely the requirement that the child pornography cross a state or national border. To hold otherwise would do violence to the plain language of the statute and fly in the face of practice, including that of the government itself, with regard to this and a host of similarly worded statutes.</p>\n<p>The government's second argument attempts to create a distinction between items that are \"shipped or transported\" using a computer, and those that are \"shipped or transported\" using other means. While we concede that it is possible Congress meant to make purely intrastate transmission by computer of these materials into a federal crime, by the plain language of the statute, it did not do so. We are therefore constrained from altering the statute based on our assumptions about what Congress wanted.</p>\n<p>Congress added the words \"by any means including by computer\" to the statute in 1988. Nov. 18, 1988, P.L. 100-690, Title VII, Subtitle N, Ch 1, Â§ 7511(b), 102 Stat. 4485. The clause does evince a particular concern with computer transmission of child pornography, but its placement Â modifying \"has been shipped or transported ... in interstate commerce\" cannot indicate that special rules apply to computer shipment or transmission. The plain language of the statute indicates that we are to treat shipment or transmission by computer the same way we would shipment or transmission by any other means. While the government's argument may be sensitive to Congress's actual desires in altering the statute, we must be bound by what Congress wrote, not what it wanted. We \"must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there. When the words of a statute are unambiguous, then, this first canon is also the last: judicial inquiry is complete.\" <i>Conn. Nat'l Bank v. Germain,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112706\"><a href=\"/opinion/112706/connecticut-nat-bank-v-germain/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">249</span></a></span>, 253-54, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112706\"><a href=\"/opinion/112706/connecticut-nat-bank-v-germain/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">391</span></a></span> (1992) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p>Having concluded that Â§ 2252(a)(2) <i>does</i> require that the government prove actual interstate transmission or shipment of the images, we turn to the government's next argument Â that it proved interstate transmission occurred in this case because the prosecution introduced evidence that Lewis used the Internet.<sup>[7]</sup> In support of this argument the government cites two of our prior cases, <i>Carroll</i> and <i>Hilton.</i> After close review of the holdings in these cases, we agree with the government that Lewis' sufficiency claim must fail.</p>\n<p>In <i>Carroll,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"734111\"><a href=\"/opinion/734111/united-states-v-christopher-b-carroll/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">740</span></a></span>, we addressed whether there was sufficient evidence to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*215</span> convict the defendant of violating 18 U.S.C. Â§ 2251(a) which criminalizes the production of child pornography, \"if such person knows or has reason to know that such visual depiction will be transported in interstate or foreign commerce by any means, including by computer.\" We cited three different ways the government had satisfied the interstate transmission element of the statute. One of them was by presenting evidence that the defendant planned to use the photographs he took as illustrations for a \"dating service\" site on the Internet. We wrote, \"[t]ransmission of photographs by means of the Internet is tantamount to moving photographs across state lines and thus constitutes transportation in interstate commerce.\" <i>Id.</i> at 742 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>The second case the government cites is <i>United States v. Hilton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199515\"><a href=\"/opinion/199515/united-states-v-hilton/\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2001). That case concerned whether there was sufficient evidence to convict the defendant of possessing child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. Â§ 2252A(a)(5)(B). In addressing the defendant's argument that the government failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the images he possessed traveled in interstate commerce, we cited <i>Carroll</i> and held that \"[u]nder the case law, proof of transmission of pornography over the Internet or over telephone lines satisfies the interstate commerce element of the offense.\" <i>Id.</i> at 54.</p>\n<p>In light of these two cases, we conclude that the government proved the images traveled interstate when it introduced evidence that Lewis received images that were transmitted over the Internet.</p>\n<p>We are not alone in holding that the government may satisfy the interstate commerce element by proving that child pornography images were transmitted over the Internet. Two other circuits, citing <i>Carroll,</i> have reached the same conclusion. In <i>United States v. Runyan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"27212\"><a href=\"/opinion/27212/united-states-v-runyan/\"><span class=\"volume\">290</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></a></span>, 239 (5th Cir.2002), the Fifth Circuit, quoting <i>Carroll,</i> held that proof of use of the Internet was sufficient to find the interstate commerce element of Â§ 2251(a) satisfied. <i>Runyan,</i> 290 F.3d at 239. And the Third Circuit similarly quoted <i>Carroll</i> as supporting its holding that Â§ 2252(a)(2)'s interstate commerce element was satisfied by the defendant's use of the Internet. <i>United States v. MacEwan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794042\"><a href=\"/opinion/794042/united-states-v-james-e-macewan/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">237</span></a></span>, 244 (3d Cir.2006) (\"because of the very interstate nature of the Internet, once a user submits a connection request to a website server or an image is transmitted from the website server back to the user the data has traveled in interstate commerce\").<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>Lewis makes a fair attempt at distinguishing both <i>Carroll</i> and <i>Hilton</i> from this case. With respect to <i>Carroll,</i> he makes three arguments. First, he notes that our holding in <i>Carroll</i> that \"[t]ransmission of photographs by means of the Internet ... constitutes transportation in interstate commerce\" was supported with citations to two other cases Â <i>United States v. Thomas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"711150\"><a href=\"/opinion/711150/united-states-v-robert-alan-thomas-94-6648-and-carleen-thomas-94-6649/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">701</span></a></span>, 706-07 (6th Cir.1996) and <i>United States v. Maxwell,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">568</span></span>, 580 (U.S.A.F.C.A.1995). Our holding then, he argues, must be interpreted through the lens of those cases, and neither of them stands for the broad proposition we attributed to them. Nevertheless, even if we were to accept Lewis' argument that we were overly generous in our reading of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*216</span> <i>Thomas</i> and <i>Maxwell,</i> that does not change the binding conclusion we reached in <i>Carroll.</i> Next, Lewis contends that, unlike the defendant in <i>Carroll,</i> he objected to the interstate commerce element at trial. Although this may be true, we fail to see how this factual distinction undermines the applicability of <i>Carroll</i> in any respect. As it is in this case, in <i>Carroll</i> our attention was squarely trained on whether the government introduced evidence sufficient to satisfy the statute's interstate commerce element. Finally, Lewis argues that, unlike in this case, in <i>Carroll</i> there was other, \"substantial evidence\" of interstate movement. True, we identified other grounds for our holding in <i>Carroll.</i> For example, we noted that the defendant told an individual that he intended to take film across state lines. <i>Carroll,</i> 105 F.3d at 742. Nevertheless, that alternative grounds existed for our holding fails to detract from our express conclusion that the use of the internet in that case was enough, standing alone, to satisfy the jurisdictional element. <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p>Lewis's attack on the <i>Hilton</i> decision is even less convincing. He essentially attacks that case for not reading <i>Carroll</i> as he does. As developed above, Lewis' interpretation of <i>Carroll</i> is overly narrow. Although we could accept Lewis' invitation to construe the <i>Carroll</i> and <i>Hilton</i> decisions as he does, to do so would be disingenuous.</p>\n<p>For the sake of completeness, we should note that Congress recently amended the child pornography statutes, including the one before us, to expand the jurisdictional coverage. It did so by replacing all instances of \"in interstate\" with \"in or affecting interstate\" commerce. Effective Child Pornography Prosecution Act of 2007, Pub.L. No. 110-358, Â§ 103. The legislative history indicates that Congress was unhappy with circuit court decisions narrowly construing the prior statute and wanted to put issues like ours to rest. <i>See</i> 153 Cong. Rec. H13591-92 (daily ed. Nov. 13, 2007) (statement of Rep. Conyers); <i>id.</i> at H13592 (statement of Rep. Goodlatte). Despite these recent developments, this case is governed by the statute as written at the time of Lewis's conduct, and our interpretation rests only on the law as it stood at that time.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.

Certain activities relating to material involving the sexual exploitation of minors</p>\n<p>(a) Any person who Â</p>\n<p>. . . .</p>\n<p>(2) knowingly receives, or distributes any visual depiction that has been mailed, or has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce, or which contains materials which have been mailed or so shipped or transported, by any means including by computer, or knowingly reproduces any visual depiction for distribution in interstate or foreign commerce by any means including by computer or through the mails, if Â</p>\n<p>(A) the producing of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct; and</p>\n<p>(B) such visual depiction is of such conduct....</p>\n<p>shall be punished as provided in subsection (b) of this section.</p>\n<p>18 U.S.C. Â§ 2252(a)(2).</p>\n<p>[5]  No evidence was presented and no argument was made concerning the \"materials containing\" prong of the statute, and we do not consider it further.</p>\n<p>[6]  The relevant language in Â§ 2252(a)(4)(B) criminalizes the possession of \"[one] or more books, magazines, periodicals, films, video tapes, or other matter which contain any visual depiction that has been mailed, or has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce, or which was produced using materials which have been mailed or so shipped or transported, by any means including by computer\" provided the depiction is of sexually explicit conduct by a minor and the depiction was created involving the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct. Thus, Â§ 2252(a)(4)(B) allows the jurisdictional element to be satisfied in two ways: either the depiction has been \"mailed, or has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce\" or else it has been \"produced using materials which have been mailed or so shipped or transported.\" <i>Id.</i> The same jurisdictional language appears in Â§ 2252A(a)(3),(5) and (6). The syntax of these two requirements compels us to read them as meaning the same thing by \"shipped or transported.\" Section 2252(a)(2), under which Lewis was convicted, does not include this second \"produced using materials\" prong, but interpretation of \"shipped or transported in interstate commerce\" in that prong sheds light on its meaning in the first.</p>\n<p>[7]  We do not consider the question of whether Congress has sufficient power under the Commerce Clause to regulate the intrastate transmission of child pornography. We have upheld the statute at issue under the Commerce Clause, and the parties here do not dispute that result. <i>United States v.
