Espinosa for petitioner.\n     James E. Grimes, Senior Litigation Counsel, Office of\nImmigration Litigation, Gregory G. Katsas, Assistant Attorney\nGeneral, Civil Division, and Linda S. Wernery, Assistant\nDirector, for respondent.\n\n\n\n                        February 25, 2009\n\n\n\n\n     *\n          Pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 43(c)(2), Attorney General\nEric H. Holder, Jr. has been substituted for former Attorney\nGeneral Michael B. Mukasey as the respondent.\n\f             LYNCH, Chief Judge. In this immigration case, petitioner\n\nVinicio Mejia-Rodriguez seeks review of a final order of removal,\n\narguing that the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") erred in\n\nfinding that (1) he was not eligible for an exception to the\n\ninadmissibility rules for those who have committed certain crimes\n\nand that (2) he was ineligible for discretionary relief from\n\nremoval by the Attorney General.            The petition does involve one\n\nissue which this court has not addressed before: the definition of\n\n\"maximum penalty possible\" in 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(ii)(II), the\n\npetty offense exception to 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), which\n\notherwise renders inadmissible aliens who have committed crimes of\n\nmoral turpitude.      On that point, we hold that the term \"maximum\n\npenalty possible\" is determined in reference to the relevant\n\nstatutory range of imprisonment and not the federal Sentencing\n\nGuidelines range.     In this we agree with the Ninth Circuit Court of\n\nAppeals.     See Mendez-Mendez v. Mukasey, 525 F.3d 828, 832-35 (9th\n\nCir. 2008).     We deny the petition for review.\n\n             Mejia-Rodriguez, who is from the Dominican Republic,\n\nbecame a lawful permanent resident of the United States on August\n\n14, 1994.    He abused this privilege by committing two felonies.           He\n\nwas convicted on May 28, 1999 of selling telecommunication devices\n\naltered to obtain unauthorized use of services, in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C.   §   1029(a)(7),   and   of    conspiracy    to   commit    fraud   in\n\nconnection     with   access   devices,     in   violation   of    18   U.S.C.\n\n                                      -2-\n\f§ 1029(b)(2).     These crimes require proof of an intent to defraud.\n\nThe statutory maximum sentence was ten years' imprisonment for the\n\nfirst offense, id. § 1029(c)(1)(A)(i), and five years' imprisonment\n\nfor   the   second,    id.   §   1029(b)(2),    (c)(1)(A)(i).    His   actual\n\nsentence was three years' probation.\n\n            Mejia-Rodriguez later left the United States and then\n\napplied for admission into the country at Logan Airport in Boston\n\non    February   28,   2005.       Lawful    permanent   residents   who   have\n\ncommitted an offense under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2) are considered to\n\nbe arriving aliens when they present themselves for admission into\n\nthe United States.       See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(13)(C)(v); De Vega v.\n\nGonzales, 503 F.3d 45, 46-47 (1st Cir. 2007).                Because of his\n\ncriminal convictions, Mejia-Rodriguez was served with a Notice to\n\nAppear, alleging that he was inadmissible and removable from the\n\nUnited States as an alien who has been convicted of a crime\n\ninvolving moral turpitude.          8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I).        There\n\nis no dispute that he had been convicted of crimes involving moral\n\nturpitude.\n\n            The removal hearings before an Immigration Judge (\"IJ\")\n\nwere held on November 23, 2005, and over six months later, on June\n\n15, 2006.     Mejia-Rodriguez admitted the factual allegations and\n\nconceded removability.           Not surprisingly, the IJ's June 15, 2006\n\ndecision found that Mejia-Rodriguez was removable.              The decision\n\nalso held that Mejia-Rodriguez was ineligible for cancellation of\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fremoval under 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a) because his time period of\n\nphysical presence and residence in the United States stopped as a\n\nmatter of law in 1997 when he committed his criminal offenses, and\n\nthose offenses were less than five years from the date of Mejia-\n\nRodriguez's admission into the United States as a lawful permanent\n\nresident.        Furthermore, the IJ found that Mejia-Rodriguez was\n\nineligible       for      the   discretionary      relief     of     waiver       of\n\ninadmissibility under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h) because no visa petition\n\nhad been filed on his behalf and because he could not meet the\n\nfamily hardship requirement because he was estranged from his\n\nwife.1\n\n            Mejia-Rodriguez appealed to the BIA on July 13, 2006,\n\narguing he was not removable because he fit within the petty\n\noffense exception under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(ii)(II).                         He\n\nargued that the BIA must measure the \"maximum penalty possible\"\n\nunder the exception by reference only to the Sentencing Guidelines,\n\nwhich suggested a sentence of four to ten months of confinement.\n\nThe BIA rejected this argument and affirmed his ineligibility for\n\ncancellation      of   removal    under   §   1229b(a)      and    waiver    under\n\n§ 1182(h).\n\n            Mejia-Rodriguez's timely petition for review to this\n\ncourt    makes    three    arguments.     First,   he   claims     that     had   he\n\n\n\n     1\n            Mejia-Rodriguez later revealed that he and his wife were\ndivorced.\n\n                                        -4-\n\fremained in the United States and not gone out of the country, he\n\nwould    have   been   ineligible   for   removal    and   thus    that    his\n\nconstitutional rights under the Equal Protection Clause have been\n\nviolated because the distinction was irrational. Second, he argues\n\nthat the petty offense exception must be read in light of the\n\nGuidelines and not the statutory maximums.          Third, he alleges that\n\nhe was eligible for a waiver under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h) because he\n\nhas \"at least one U.S. citizen child.\"2\n\n            We have jurisdiction to review the first two claims but\n\nnot the third.    Our review in this case, under the REAL ID Act, is\n\nrestricted to constitutional claims or questions of law.              See 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D); De Araujo v. Gonzales, 457 F.3d\n\n146, 153 (1st Cir. 2006); see also Conteh v. Gonzales, 461 F.3d 45,\n\n63-64 (1st Cir. 2006)(discussing restrictions on judicial review in\n\ncases involving waiver of inadmissibility under § 1182(h)).\n\n            The   equal   protection   argument,3    cursorily     made,    is\n\nwithout merit, and is based on mistakes of both law and fact.              To\n\nstart, Mejia-Rodriguez's argument is based entirely on the wrong\n\nsection of the immigration statute.       Mejia-Rodriguez asserts that\n\nthe application of 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) violated his\n\n\n     2\n          Mejia-Rodriguez does not challenge               the    denial    of\ncancellation of removal under § 1229b(a).\n     3\n          Mejia-Rodriguez describes his claim in terms of due\nprocess, but it is more fairly characterized as an equal protection\nclaim. See Malagon de Fuentes v. Gonzales, 462 F.3d 498, 503 (5th\nCir. 2006).\n\n                                    -5-\n\fconstitutional rights because, if he had remained in the country,\n\nhe would not have been subject to removal, and there is no\n\njustification for distinguishing between him and a lawful permanent\n\nresident who had not left as he did.         But § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) is\n\nnot relevant to this distinction.         What is relevant is 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1101(a)(13)(C)(v), which is the provision that renders him an\n\n\"arriving alien\" and so subject to charges of inadmissibility.\n\n            Mejia-Rodriguez's argument is also based on a factual\n\nmistake.     He would have been subject to removal even if he had\n\nremained in the United States, given that he had been convicted of\n\na   crime   involving    moral   turpitude   within   five   years   of   his\n\nadmission.    See 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(i).\n\n            In any event, these congressionally determined categories\n\nare subject at most to rational basis review.          See Almon v. Reno,\n\n192 F.3d 28, 31 (1st Cir. 1999); see also Malagon de Fuentes v.\n\nGonzales, 462 F.3d 498, 503-04 (5th Cir. 2006). A lawful permanent\n\nresident who departs the country and attempts to return is not\n\nsimilarly situated to a lawful permanent resident who never left.\n\nSee Landon v. Plasencia, 459 U.S. 21, 31 (1982); United States ex\n\nrel Volpe v. Smith, 289 U.S. 422, 425-26 (1933); Malagon de\n\nFuentes, 462 F.3d at 503-04.\n\n            His second argument concerning interpretation of the\n\npetty offense exception involves a pure issue of law and is\n\nreviewed de novo.       See Elien v. Ashcroft, 364 F.3d 392, 396 (1st\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fCir. 2004); see also Mendez-Mendez, 525 F.3d at 832.            We will put\n\naside the fact that the petty offense exception only applies to\n\naliens   who   have   committed   only   one   crime,   see    8   U.S.C.   §\n\n1182(a)(2)(A)(ii), (a)(2)(B), and Mejia-Rodriguez has committed\n\ntwo, to reach the merits of his argument.        We will also set aside\n\nthe fact that he conceded removability before the IJ and that binds\n\nhim on the merits.    See Qureshi v. Gonzales, 442 F.3d 985, 990 (7th\n\nCir. 2006); Selimi v. INS, 312 F.3d 854, 860 (7th Cir. 2002).\n\n           The relevant portion of the petty offense exception\n\nprovides that the inadmissibility rule for an alien who committed\n\na crime involving moral turpitude, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I),\n\nshall not apply if:\n\n           The maximum penalty possible for the crime of\n           which the alien was convicted . . . did not\n           exceed imprisonment for one year and, if the\n           alien was convicted of such crime, the alien\n           was not sentenced to a term of imprisonment in\n           excess of 6 months . . . .\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(ii)(II).         The statute itself makes no\n\nreference to the Sentencing Guidelines.           The language of the\n\nstatute plainly refers to the \"maximum penalty possible\" and that\n\nmaximum is set by statute.        That maximum possible punishment is\n\nfor \"the crime of which the alien was convicted,\" a reference again\n\nto the statute of conviction.     See Mendez-Mendez, 525 F.3d at 832-\n\n35.\n\n           The fact that Mejia-Rodriguez was not actually sentenced\n\nto confinement of less than a year is irrelevant.             The statutory\n\n                                   -7-\n\flanguage is plain and requires rejection of his argument.       See\n\nAquino-Encarnacion v. INS, 296 F.3d 56, 57 (1st Cir. 2002) (per\n\ncuriam).\n\n           Mejia-Rodriguez's third argument is that he was eligible\n\nfor a waiver under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h) because he has a child who is\n\na U.S. citizen.     This newfound claim is based on a factual\n\nassertion that was not presented to the agency.    Mejia-Rodriguez\n\nhas thus failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.   See Silva\n\nv. Gonzales, 455 F.3d 26, 28-29 (1st Cir. 2006).        And had any\n\ndiscretionary decision been made on the facts of his case, this\n\nwould not be subject to judicial review, given the restraints of 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1252(a)(2).   See Conteh, 461 F.3d at 63-64.\n\n           The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                -8-\n\f",

The petition does involve one issue which this court has not addressed before: the definition of \"maximum penalty possible\" in 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(ii)(II), the petty offense exception to 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), which otherwise renders inadmissible aliens who have committed crimes of moral turpitude. On that point, we hold that the term \"maximum penalty possible\" is determined in reference to the relevant statutory range of imprisonment and not the federal Sentencing Guidelines range. In this we agree with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. <i>See </i><i>Mendez-Mendez v. Mukasey,</i> 525 F.3d 828, 832-35 (9th Cir.2008). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p>Mejia-Rodriguez, who is from the Dominican Republic, became a lawful permanent resident of the United States on August 14, 1994. He abused this privilege by committing two felonies. He was convicted on May 28, 1999 of selling telecommunication devices altered to obtain unauthorized use of services, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1029(a)(7), and of conspiracy to commit fraud in connection with access devices, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1029(b)(2). These crimes require proof of an intent to defraud. The statutory maximum sentence was ten years' imprisonment for the first offense, <i>id.</i> § 1029(c)(1)(A)(i), and five years' imprisonment for the second, <i>id.</i> § 1029(b)(2), (c)(1)(A)(i). His actual sentence was three years' probation.</p>\n<p>Mejia-Rodriguez later left the United States and then applied for admission into the country at Logan Airport in Boston on February 28, 2005. Lawful permanent residents who have committed an offense under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2) are considered to be arriving aliens when they present themselves for admission into the United States. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(13)(C)(v); <i>De Vega v. Gonzales,</i> 503 F.3d 45, 46-47 (1st Cir.2007). Because of his criminal convictions, Mejia-Rodriguez was served with a Notice to Appear, alleging that he was inadmissible and removable from the United States as an alien who has been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude. 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I). There is no dispute that he had been convicted of crimes involving moral turpitude.</p>\n<p>The removal hearings before an Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") were held on November 23, 2005, and over six months later, on June 15, 2006. Mejia-Rodriguez admitted the factual allegations and conceded removability. Not surprisingly, the IJ's June 15, 2006 decision found that Mejia-Rodriguez was removable. The decision also held that Mejia-Rodriguez was ineligible for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a) because his time period of physical presence and residence in the United States stopped as a matter of law in 1997 when he committed his criminal offenses, and those offenses were less than five years from the date of Mejia-Rodriguez's admission into the United States as a lawful permanent resident. Furthermore, the IJ found that Mejia-Rodriguez was ineligible for the discretionary relief of waiver of inadmissibility under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h) because no visa petition had <span class=\"star-pagination\">*49</span> been filed on his behalf and because he could not meet the family hardship requirement because he was estranged from his wife.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Mejia-Rodriguez appealed to the BIA on July 13, 2006, arguing he was not removable because he fit within the petty offense exception under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(ii)(II).

Wernery, Assistant Director, for respondent.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, Chief Judge, SELYA and BOUDIN, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>LYNCH, Chief Judge.</p>\n<p>In this immigration case, petitioner Vinicio Mejia-Rodriguez seeks review of a final order of removal, arguing that the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") erred in finding that (1) he was not eligible for an exception to the inadmissibility rules for those who have committed certain crimes and that (2) he was ineligible for discretionary relief from removal by the Attorney General. The petition does involve one issue which this court has not addressed before: the definition of \"maximum penalty possible\" in 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(ii)(II), the petty offense exception to 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), which otherwise renders inadmissible aliens who have committed crimes of moral turpitude. On that point, we hold that the term \"maximum penalty possible\" is determined in reference to the relevant statutory range of imprisonment and not the federal Sentencing Guidelines range. In this we agree with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. <i>See </i><i>Mendez-Mendez v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1316413\"><a href=\"/opinion/1316413/mendez-mendez-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">525</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">828</span></a></span>, 832-35 (9th Cir.2008). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p>Mejia-Rodriguez, who is from the Dominican Republic, became a lawful permanent resident of the United States on August 14, 1994. He abused this privilege by committing two felonies. He was convicted on May 28, 1999 of selling telecommunication devices altered to obtain unauthorized use of services, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1029(a)(7), and of conspiracy to commit fraud in connection with access devices, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1029(b)(2). These crimes require proof of an intent to defraud. The statutory maximum sentence was ten years' imprisonment for the first offense, <i>id.</i> § 1029(c)(1)(A)(i), and five years' imprisonment for the second, <i>id.</i> § 1029(b)(2), (c)(1)(A)(i). His actual sentence was three years' probation.</p>\n<p>Mejia-Rodriguez later left the United States and then applied for admission into the country at Logan Airport in Boston on February 28, 2005. Lawful permanent residents who have committed an offense under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2) are considered to be arriving aliens when they present themselves for admission into the United States. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(13)(C)(v); <i>De Vega v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202940\"><a href=\"/opinion/202940/de-vega-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 46-47 (1st Cir.2007). Because of his criminal convictions, Mejia-Rodriguez was served with a Notice to Appear, alleging that he was inadmissible and removable from the United States as an alien who has been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude. 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I). There is no dispute that he had been convicted of crimes involving moral turpitude.</p>\n<p>The removal hearings before an Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") were held on November 23, 2005, and over six months later, on June 15, 2006. Mejia-Rodriguez admitted the factual allegations and conceded removability. Not surprisingly, the IJ's June 15, 2006 decision found that Mejia-Rodriguez was removable. The decision also held that Mejia-Rodriguez was ineligible for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a) because his time period of physical presence and residence in the United States stopped as a matter of law in 1997 when he committed his criminal offenses, and those offenses were less than five years from the date of Mejia-Rodriguez's admission into the United States as a lawful permanent resident. Furthermore, the IJ found that Mejia-Rodriguez was ineligible for the discretionary relief of waiver of inadmissibility under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h) because no visa petition had <span class=\"star-pagination\">*49</span> been filed on his behalf and because he could not meet the family hardship requirement because he was estranged from his wife.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Mejia-Rodriguez appealed to the BIA on July 13, 2006, arguing he was not removable because he fit within the petty offense exception under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(ii)(II). He argued that the BIA must measure the \"maximum penalty possible\" under the exception by reference only to the Sentencing Guidelines, which suggested a sentence of four to ten months of confinement. The BIA rejected this argument and affirmed his ineligibility for cancellation of removal under § 1229b(a) and waiver under § 1182(h).</p>\n<p>Mejia-Rodriguez's timely petition for review to this court makes three arguments. First, he claims that had he remained in the United States and not gone out of the country, he would have been ineligible for removal and thus that his constitutional rights under the Equal Protection Clause have been violated because the distinction was irrational. Second, he argues that the petty offense exception must be read in light of the Guidelines and not the statutory maximums. Third, he alleges that he was eligible for a waiver under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h) because he has \"at least one U.S. citizen child.\"<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>We have jurisdiction to review the first two claims but not the third. Our review in this case, under the REAL ID Act, is restricted to constitutional claims or questions of law. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D); <i>De Araujo v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">146</span></span>, 153 (1st Cir.2006); <i>see also </i><i>Conteh v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202370\"><a href=\"/opinion/202370/conteh-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 63-64 (1st Cir.2006)(discussing restrictions on judicial review in cases involving waiver of inadmissibility under § 1182(h)).</p>\n<p>The equal protection argument,<sup>[3]</sup> cursorily made, is without merit, and is based on mistakes of both law and fact. To start, Mejia-Rodriguez's argument is based entirely on the wrong section of the immigration statute. Mejia-Rodriguez asserts that the application of 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) violated his constitutional rights because, if he had remained in the country, he would not have been subject to removal, and there is no justification for distinguishing between him and a lawful permanent resident who had not left as he did. But § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) is not relevant to this distinction. What is relevant is 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(13)(C)(v), which is the provision that renders him an \"arriving alien\" and so subject to charges of inadmissibility.</p>\n<p>Mejia-Rodriguez's argument is also based on a factual mistake. He would have been subject to removal even if he had remained in the United States, given that he had been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude within five years of his admission. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(i).</p>\n<p>In any event, these congressionally determined categories are subject at most to rational basis review. <i>See </i><i>Almon v. Reno,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">192</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></span>, 31 (1st Cir.1999); <i>see also </i><i>Malagon de Fuentes v.
