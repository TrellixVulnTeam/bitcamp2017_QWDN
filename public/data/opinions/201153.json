Plaintiff, an engineer and writer,\n\nbrought suit against her publisher for accepting book revisions\n\nfrom her co-author without her consent and for giving a third\n\nindividual co-authorship credit when she felt that his effort did\n\nnot merit such credit.            After losing her Lanham Act claim at\n\nsummary judgment, and suffering judgment as a matter of law and an\n\nadverse jury verdict on her remaining claims at trial (as well as\n\na judgment against her for attorney's fees post-trial), Flynn\n\nraises a bevy of claims on appeal.            We affirm.\n\n                                      I.\n\n             We set forth the background, reserving some of the\n\ndetails until the discussion of the individual issues on appeal.\n\nPlaintiff-appellant Anita M. Flynn is an electrical engineer and\n\nrobotics scientist who wrote a book with a colleague, Joseph Jones,\n\nentitled Mobile Robots: From Inspiration to Implementation.                The\n\nbook was published in 1993 by Jones & Bartlett Publishers, Inc.\n\nShortly      after   publication,     Jones     &   Bartlett    assigned   its\n\npublication rights to AK Peters, a publishing house named after its\n\nprincipals, Alice and Klaus Peters.           The book was a great success,\n\nand Klaus Peters asked Flynn and Jones to write a second edition of\n\nthe book in 1997.       Hoping to have the revised edition published by\n\nthe   next    spring,    Peters    suggested    that   they    invite   another\n\ncontributor to help them with the research and writing.             Jones and\n\nPeters later agreed that Bruce Seiger, a high school teacher, would\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fbe added as a co-author and would write a chapter addressing\n\neducational applications and curriculum proposals.\n\n          To confirm this agreement, Peters wrote to Flynn on\n\nAugust 23, 1997, asking if she was amenable to the proposed\n\nrevision with Seiger’s assistance.    Flynn responded in a letter\n\ndated November 16, 1997:\n\n          I received your letter as to the second\n          edition of our book and would be happy to\n          agree to your suggested arrangement--on one\n          condition. That is, you send me my money for\n          my portion of the royalties on sales from\n          January '97 through June '97 in the next\n          month.\n\nAlice Peters responded via letter on December 4, 1997:\n\n          Thank you very much for your letter of\n          November 16. I am enclosing an accounting of\n          the sales of your book, Mobile Robots, for the\n          period January-June 1997 along with a check\n          for settlement of the royalty for those sales.\n          We are pleased that you have agreed to our\n          suggestion regarding the 2d edition of Mobile\n          Robots. We will be forwarding a contract to\n          you soon for the signature.1\n\nThe publisher did not directly send Flynn a revised contract.\n\nHowever, it had previously sent Jones four copies of the author\n\ncontract (one each for Jones, Flynn, Seiger, and AK Peters) and two\n\ncopies of a contract for the curriculum guide (one each for Jones\n\nand Seiger) on October 3, 1997.   Jones and Seiger began revising\n\n\n\n     1\n      Prior to trial in the district court, AK Peters claimed that\nthis agreement constituted a separate, superseding contract between\nAK Peters and Flynn; however, the publisher chose not to argue that\npoint at trial.\n\n                               -3-\n\fthe text even though neither of the two original authors had signed\n\nthe contract.\n\n          Flynn did not have any further discussions with AK Peters\n\nor its principals while Jones and Seiger revised the text.       In\n\nfact, she was largely uninvolved in the revision process.   Perhaps\n\nrecognizing her diminished role, she agreed in May 1998 to give\n\nhalf of the royalties from the revised edition to Jones and to\n\nsplit the other half with Seiger.2\n\n          Although Jones and Seiger worked together to revise the\n\ntext, their relationship was not always harmonious.     Jones wrote\n\nSeiger an e-mail in early August 1998, in which he said that he was\n\nplanning to drop Seiger as a co-author because \"none of the\n\ncontributions [Seiger was] uniquely qualified to make appear[ed] in\n\nthe new edition.\" After they discussed Seiger's involvement in the\n\nproject, Jones decided not to remove Seiger's name from the book\n\nafter Seiger agreed to take on more work.   At some point, Jones and\n\nSeiger decided, with AK Peters' consent, to publish the curriculum\n\nguide as a separate book rather than including it as a section of\n\nMobile Robots.\n\n          AK Peters sent the book to the printer without Flynn's\n\nknowledge in early September 1998.   A few weeks later, she asked\n\n\n     2\n      AK Peters has not paid Flynn any of the royalties from the\nsale of the revised edition of Mobile Robots. It claims that it is\nwaiting for the authors to settle on the final allocation scheme.\nFlynn claims that it is simply withholding the royalties in\nretaliation for her lawsuit.\n\n                               -4-\n\fJones if she could see a copy of the revised manuscript.         In mid-\n\nOctober, well over one month after AK Peters sent the manuscript to\n\nthe printer, Flynn told Jones that \"[she] looked through the\n\nmanuscript and didn't see anything that [Seiger] wrote.\"              Jones\n\nresponded that Seiger \"revised [one of the] chapter[s], added the\n\ncontests section, and contacted virtually every supplier in the\n\nyellow pages, data books and trade magazines sections to verify the\n\naddresses.      He also did a word-by-word review of the whole book\n\nlooking   for    typos   and    inconsistencies.\"     Jones   noted     the\n\ndifficulties that he and Seiger had in August, but said that\n\n\"[Seiger] actually did a tremendous amount of work at the end,\n\nwithout his help it would not have been possible to get the book\n\nout by [the deadline].\"        Responding to Flynn's concern that Seiger\n\ndid not write the curriculum chapter, Jones informed her that he\n\nand Seiger were going to write that chapter as a separate book.\n\n          Flynn insisted that Seiger's contribution was \"more in\n\nline with an acknowledgment\" and refused to sign the revised\n\nauthors' contract, even after Jones offered to restructure the\n\nroyalty distribution. Jones informed Flynn in late October that if\n\nshe did not sign the contract, AK Peters would exercise its rights\n\nunder Paragraph L of the original contract, which read:\n\n          The Author/Editor agrees to revise the Work\n          when the Publisher shall decide that a\n          revision is desirable, and to deliver same\n          within a reasonable time after such request.\n          Should   the  Author/Editor  be   unable  or\n          unwilling to undertake such revision, or be\n\n                                     -5-\n\f          deceased, the Publisher may arrange in\n          agreement with the Author/Editor not to be\n          unreasonably withheld, for the preparation of\n          a revised manuscript, the cost of which\n          (including such royalties or fees as the\n          Publisher may elect to pay) shall be paid by\n          the Publisher and charged against any first\n          royalties that may accrue to the Author/Editor\n          from the sale of the revised edition.      All\n          terms of this Agreement shall apply to each\n          revision as though it were the work being\n          published for the first time.\n\nJones claimed that this provision \"basically says that they can\n\npublish revised editions of the book and, if [Jones and Flynn]\n\ndon't help, they will employ whatever help they need and allocate\n\npayments accordingly.\"\n\n          Flynn sent a letter to AK Peters via certified mail three\n\ndays later, informing the publisher that she had not agreed to the\n\nrevised contract.   She said that she had reviewed the revised\n\nmanuscript and found a number of errors but said that her biggest\n\nconcern was the decision to list Seiger as a co-author.          She said\n\nthat she only agreed to AK Peters' proposed revision because she\n\nthought that Seiger was going to write a curriculum chapter and\n\nthat she refused to share credit and royalties for the revised\n\nedition of the book without this contribution.       She also expressed\n\nconcern that Seiger rewrote one of the chapters that was designed\n\nto provide an easy introduction to robotics and added an electronic\n\ncircuit design that would not work.         Flynn acknowledged Jones'\n\ncomment regarding   AK   Peters'   right   to   revise   the   text   under\n\nParagraph L but asserted that this right was not triggered under\n\n                                   -6-\n\fthe circumstances present at that time.      She argued that Paragraph\n\nL only gave the publisher discretion to revise when an author was\n\nunable or unwilling to participate in a revision.         Since Flynn had\n\nattempted to participate in the revision, AK Peters could not\n\ninvoke its Paragraph L rights.       Similarly, she claimed that since\n\nher objection to listing Seiger as a co-author was reasonable, the\n\npublisher could not add him as an author until she was satisfied\n\nwith his contribution.    She said that \"[i]f Mr. Seiger performed\n\nhis part of the deal, there would be very few problems.            He did\n\nnot.\"   Toward the end of the letter, Flynn stated that she would\n\nseek appropriate legal relief if AK Peters insisted on continuing\n\nwith publication of the revised edition as it appeared at that\n\ntime.\n\n          AK   Peters   responded    to   that   letter   by   noting   the\n\ncontributions that Seiger made to the book and by informing Flynn\n\nthat it had already sent the book to the printer by the time that\n\nshe notified them of her objections.        It offered to address the\n\nerrors that she identified by printing an errata sheet and to\n\naddress the authorship issue by listing her before Seiger.\n\n          That arrangement was not acceptable to Flynn.         She filed\n\na lawsuit against AK Peters and its principals in the United States\n\nDistrict Court for the District of Northern California on December\n\n2, 1998 alleging: 1) violation of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. §\n\n1125(a); 2) violation of California Business and Professions Code\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f§ 17200 (concerning \"unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business acts\n\nor     practices     and   unfair,   deceptive,     untrue    or     misleading\n\nadvertising\"); 3) violation of the California Civil Code § 3344\n\n(concerning trade misappropriation); and 4) breach of contract.3\n\nAfter the suit was transferred to the District of Massachusetts, AK\n\nPeters filed a motion for summary judgment on all claims on March\n\n14, 2000.      The court granted the motion with regard to the Lanham\n\nAct claim, and the parties went to trial on the remaining three\n\nclaims.\n\n              At trial, AK Peters filed a motion for judgment as a\n\nmatter of law (JMOL) on all three claims after both sides had the\n\nopportunity to present their cases, arguing that it was entitled to\n\njudgment on the breach of contract claim because Flynn failed to\n\nshow that AK Peters materially breached the contract and that even\n\nif it did breach the original contract between the authors and the\n\npublisher, Flynn failed to show that she suffered any damages as a\n\nresult of that breach. Flynn responded, inter alia, that AK Peters\n\ndid indeed breach Paragraph L of the original contract and that she\n\nhad presented sufficient evidence of damages during her trial\n\ntestimony. After stating that it would reserve its decision on the\n\nJMOL       motion,   the   court   asked    the   parties    to    submit   jury\n\ninstructions that it could use to formulate the jury charge.\n\n\n       3\n      Flynn filed a separate suit against Jones and Seiger on June\n26, 2000 that was consolidated with the suit against Peters and\nsettled on January 29, 2003.\n\n                                      -8-\n\fFlynn's proposed instruction stated that the \"essential elements of\n\na breach\" included \"[d]amage to the Plaintiff arising from the\n\nfailure to perform.\"\n\n            The next morning, prior to charging the jury, the court\n\nannounced that it was dismissing the contract claim “on the grounds\n\nthat there's an absolute dearth of evidence with regard to damage\n\nflowing from the breach of contract.\"4           It denied the motion with\n\nregard to the two California state law claims and informed the\n\nparties that “[they] may wish to adjust [their] closing statement\n\naccordingly.”     The parties made their closing arguments, the court\n\ninstructed the jury, and the jury returned a verdict in favor of AK\n\nPeters on the two California state law claims.              Flynn did not file\n\nany post-verdict motions.       However, AK Peters filed a motion for\n\n$55,000    in   attorney's   fees   under    section      3344's    fee-shifting\n\nprovision.      The court granted that motion.             Flynn subsequently\n\nappealed   the   final   judgment   on     the   merits    and     the   award   of\n\nattorney's fees.\n\n            Flynn essentially raises four issues in her appeal.\n\nFirst, she argues that the publisher’s use of her name on the book\n\nwithout her consent constituted a violation of the Lanham Act and\n\nthat the district court applied the wrong standard when it granted\n\n\n\n     4\n      Flynn argued that the court should still enjoin AK Peters\nfrom selling Mobile Robots to remedy the purported breach, but the\ncourt rejected that request. Flynn does not renew that request on\nappeal.\n\n                                     -9-\n\fAK Peters summary judgment on her Lanham Act claim.          Second, she\n\nclaims that the district court erroneously granted JMOL to the\n\npublisher on her breach of contract claim based on its mistaken\n\nconclusion that she had not demonstrated damages arising from the\n\nalleged breach.     Relatedly, she claims that the timing of the\n\ncourt's erroneous JMOL ruling, which the court issued right before\n\nthe parties presented their closing arguments to the jury, created\n\nthe misperception in the jurors' minds that she consented to\n\npublication   and   that   this   perception   prejudiced    the   jury's\n\nconsideration of her two California state law claims.         Third, she\n\nclaims that the court improperly instructed the jury regarding the\n\nmeaning of Paragraph L and its relevance to her California state\n\nlaw claims.   Finally, she claims that AK Peters waived its right to\n\nattorney's fees under the California fee-shifting provision; even\n\nif it did not waive its right to fees, she asserts that the\n\ndistrict court's fee award was overly generous.         We consider these\n\nclaims seriatim.\n\n                                   II.\n\nA.   Lanham Act\n\n           Flynn claims that AK Peters violated the Lanham Act by\n\nlisting her as an author of the second edition of Mobile Robots\n\nwithout her   consent.     More   specifically,   she    alleged   in   the\n\ndistrict court that \"[t]he misleading use of her name is likely to\n\ncause confusion by consumers as well as plaintiff's academic peers\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fin that it will be assumed that she contributed to the revisions\n\nand approved of the changes.\"        Concluding that Flynn failed to\n\ndemonstrate that her name \"is so associated with robotics that\n\nwithin the   robotic   community    it    has   an   independent   value   or\n\nmeaning,\" the district court granted summary judgment to AK Peters\n\non her Lanham Act claim. Flynn claims that this \"independent value\n\ntest\" has no basis in First Circuit precedent and that she properly\n\nopposed AK Peters’ summary judgment motion by citing her experience\n\nin the robotics field and by alleging that she is famous within the\n\nrobotics community.5\n\n          Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act creates civil liability\n\nfor, inter alia:\n\n          Any person who, on or in connection with any\n          goods or services, . . . uses in commerce any\n          . . . false designation of origin [which] is\n          likely to cause confusion, or to cause\n          mistake, or to deceive as to the affiliation,\n          connection, or association of such person with\n          another   person,  or   as   to  the   origin,\n          sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods,\n          services, or commercial activities by another\n          person[.]\n\n15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)(1)(A).    This provision \"is designed to reach,\n\namong other things, attempts to appropriate the goodwill associated\n\nwith a competitor's trademark by means of confusingly similar\n\n\n\n     5\n      No party has argued to us the effect of Dastar v. Twentieth\nCentury Fox Film Corp., 123 S. Ct. 2041 (2003) on this claim. As\na result we do not reach any issue under Dastar as to whether a\nclaim is stated here. Rather, we deal with the case on the terms\nbriefed to us by the parties.\n\n                                   -11-\n\fmarking and packaging, which would create an impression that the\n\nproducts   of    the   defendant   originated   with   the   plaintiff.\"\n\nPurolator, Inc. v. EFRA Distributors, Inc., 687 F.2d 554, 561 (1st\n\nCir. 1982).     See also Waldman Pub. Corp. v. Landoll, Inc., 43 F.3d\n\n775, 780 (2d Cir. 1994) (stating that section 43(a) prohibits,\n\ninter alia , \"'palming off[,]' . . . in which 'A' sells its product\n\nunder 'B's' name\").      The key inquiry in a section 43(a) case is\n\nwhether the defendant's use of the plaintiff's trademark creates\n\nconfusion in the minds of consumers.\n\n           The Lanham Act defines the term \"trademark\" to include\n\nany word or name used by a person \"to identify and distinguish his\n\nor her goods . . . from those manufactured or sold by others and to\n\nindicate the source of the goods, even if that source is unknown.\"\n\n15 U.S.C. § 1127.       Strong and distinctive trademarks, such as\n\nfanciful words (e.g., \"Clorox\") and words used in arbitrary ways\n\n(e.g., \"Apple Computers\"), receive greater protection than weak,\n\ngeneric marks (e.g., \"bleach\").      Some words are so common within a\n\nparticular context that they cannot secure any trademark protection\n\nuntil they acquire a special association with a particular source\n\nof consumer products or services.         This association is called\n\n\"secondary meaning.\"      Pursuant to this doctrine, \"'[w]ords which\n\nhave a primary meaning of their own . . . may by long use in\n\nconnection with a particular product, come to be known by the\n\npublic as specifically designating that product.'\"       Volkswagenwerk\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fAG   v.

Viacom Int'l, Inc., 981 F.2d 602, 606 (1st Cir.\n\n1992) (stating that secondary meaning \"refers to a word's, or a\n\nsign's, ability to tell the public that the word or sign serves a\n\nspecial trademark function, namely, that it denotes a product or\n\nservice that comes from a particular source\").                   \"The establishment\n\nof secondary meaning in a word is an issue of fact,\" Wheeler, 814\n\nF.2d at 816, and the individual seeking protection for a mark bears\n\nthe burden of proving that secondary meaning has attached within\n\nthe relevant class of consumers.

See Donoghue v. IBC/USA (Publications), Inc.,\n\n886 F. Supp. 947, 952 (D. Mass. 1995) (\"[S]urnames, when used as\n\ntrademarks, are inherently indistinctive, i.e., weak [and] are\n\npermitted trademark protection only upon a showing that they have\n\nbecome strong marks by acquiring distinctiveness through secondary\n\nmeaning.\"); 2 McCarthy, supra, § 13:2.       According to Professor\n\nMcCarthy:\n\n            Secondary   meaning    grows   out   of   long\n            association of the [personal] name with the\n            business, and thereby becomes the name of the\n            business as such; is acquired when the name\n            and the business become synonymous in the\n            public mind; and submerges the primary meaning\n            of the name as a word identifying a person, in\n            favor of its meaning as a word identifying\n            that business.\n\nId.   Therefore, before we can consider whether AK Peters infringed\n\nupon Flynn's purported use of her name as a trademark, we must\n\nevaluate whether Flynn's name has acquired secondary meaning within\n\nthe relevant class of consumers.\n\n            \"Proof of secondary meaning entails vigorous evidentiary\n\nrequirements.\"   Boston Beer Co., 9 F.2d at 181.   The plaintiff must\n\nnot only show that it used a personal name as a trademark, but that\n\na \"substantial portion of the consuming public associates [the\n\nname] specifically with [its] business.\" Id. at 182. Furthermore,\n\nthe plaintiff must show that these consumers base purchasing\n\n\n                                -14-\n\fdecisions upon seeing the trademark (i.e. the personal name) on the\n\nproduct:\n\n            To acquire a secondary meaning in the minds of\n            the buying public, a labelled product, when\n            shown to a prospective customer, must prompt\n            the reaction, \"That is the product I want\n            because I know that all products with that\n            label come from a single source and have the\n            same level of quality.\" In other words, the\n            article must proclaim its identity of source\n            and quality, and not serve simply to stimulate\n            further enquiry about it.\n\n2   McCarthy,     supra,    §     15:11.       The     plaintiff    can    meet    this\n\nevidentiary burden through the use of direct evidence, such as\n\nconsumer surveys or testimony from consumers, or through the use of\n\ncircumstantial evidence.           Since Flynn did not provide any direct\n\nevidence on this issue, we will focus on the requirements for\n\ncircumstantial evidence.             A plaintiff may establish secondary\n\nmeaning for a name by presenting circumstantial evidence regarding:\n\n\"(1) the length and manner of its use, (2) the nature and extent of\n\nadvertising and promotion of the mark and (3) the efforts made in\n\nthe direction of promoting a conscious connection, in the public's\n\nmind,   between    the     name    or   mark     and   a   particular     product    or\n\nventure.\"    Boston Beer Co., 9 F.3d at 182; see also 815 Tonawanda\n\nSt. Corp. v. Fay's Drug Co., 842 F.2d 643, 648 (2d Cir. 1988)\n\n(including among the factors that may be considered to prove\n\nsecondary meaning \"advertising expenditures, consumer surveys,\n\nmedia   coverage,    attempts        to    copy      the   mark,   and    length    and\n\nexclusivity of use\").\n\n                                          -15-\n\f          Flynn submitted for the summary judgment record a copy of\n\nher curriculum vitae and an affidavit in which she stated that she\n\nhas worked in the robotics field since 1985, has given seventy\n\ninvited talks and written twenty-nine papers in the field, and has\n\nfounded a company that designs micro robots.   Viewed in the proper\n\nlight, she claims that this evidence demonstrates that \"she has an\n\nesteemed reputation and a well-recognized name.\"         This claim\n\nignores the stringent requirements for secondary meaning evidence.\n\n\"Such 'opinion' testimony by a [party] is considered self-serving\n\nand of little probative value.\"    Fay's Drug Co., 842 F.2d at 648.\n\nIt would be more important to know, for example, how likely it\n\nwould be for the average consumer of books like Mobile Robots to be\n\naware of the papers Flynn cites.   It is the mindset of these likely\n\nconsumers and not simply the strength of her publication record in\n\nthe abstract that matters in determining whether secondary meaning\n\nhas attached.   Moreover, Flynn declared that the authors intended\n\nto market the book to \"a wide audience\" from \"high school age to\n\nPh.D. level researchers\"; therefore, it is this broad class of\n\nconsumers and not a select subset of academic \"insiders\" that\n\nmatters for secondary meaning purposes.     Flynn failed to produce\n\nany evidence demonstrating that this extended group of consumers is\n\naware of her academic achievements.\n\n          Flynn also says in her affidavit that a handful of\n\nstrangers have told her that they recognized her from a talk or\n\n\n                               -16-\n\fthat they had read her book, and her nephew says in his affidavit\n\nthat a robotics graduate student that he met said that Flynn was\n\n\"famous.\"     However, such limited anecdotal evidence does little to\n\nestablish that her name has acquired secondary meaning within the\n\nclass of consumers who would be likely to purchase a book on\n\nrobotics, and that these consumers would be more likely to purchase\n\nbooks because her name was on the cover.\n\n             Flynn's reliance on Donoghue highlights the weakness of\n\nher case.     In that case, the court enjoined a mailing company from\n\nusing the plaintiff's name and face in an advertisement after the\n\nplaintiff, a financial expert, introduced evidence demonstrating\n\nthat\n\n             [He] is a nationally known investment advisor,\n             with expertise in the subject of money market\n             and mutual fund investing. He has been in the\n             business of providing investment advisory\n             services to the general investing public for\n             approximately twenty-two years. The plaintiff\n             has written ten books on the subject of\n             investment   advice   and   is  a   nationally\n             syndicated financial columnist. Over the past\n             decade, he has appeared frequently on network,\n             cable and syndicated television shows dealing\n             with financial markets, financial advice, and\n             investments, and, over the past twenty-two\n             years, he has participated in hundreds of\n             seminars and conferences regarding investment\n             strategies.\n\n\nId.    at   948-49.   He   also   produced   a   monthly   audio   cassette\n\ninvestment advisory service and an electronic mutual fund tracking\n\nand analysis service and published a print newsletter, which had\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\f17,000 subscribers and was \"well-known among consumers and in the\n\nfinancial advisory services industry for its analyses of market\n\ntrends and its mutual fund recommendations.\"                Id. at 949.         Given\n\nthis   circumstantial     evidence,     the     court      concluded     that    the\n\nplaintiff \"has become widely known, due to his efforts during the\n\npast twenty-two years, as [a financial] expert\" and that his name\n\n\"through numerous publications and determined self-promotion, has\n\nbecome associated in the public mind with expertise in strategic\n\ninvestment advice.\"      Id. at 953.        Accordingly, the court did not\n\nhave   difficulty     concluding    that    \"the     plaintiff's    surname       has\n\nacquired a secondary meaning vesting it with protected trademark\n\nstatus.\"    Id.\n\n            Flynn's    summary     judgment    offerings      do   not    remotely\n\napproach the evidence of secondary meaning presented in Donoghue.\n\nIf Flynn's evidence demonstrated anything, it is that she has\n\nexpertise in the robotics field and that a handful of individuals\n\nin the field have recognized her name and face.               That evidence did\n\nnot demonstrate that the relevant consumers have associated her\n\nname with a product.       She did not demonstrate that a reasonable\n\nfactfinder could conclude that her name serves anything more than\n\nits primary function to identify her as an individual.                 Given this\n\nfailure    to   demonstrate   that    her     name   has    acquired     secondary\n\nmeaning, we must agree with the district court that the Lanham Act\n\ndoes not apply to her claim.\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\fB.   Breach of Contract\n\n           Flynn   alleged   that   AK     Peters   breached   its    original\n\npublication contract with her by accepting revisions to Mobile\n\nRobots and adding Seiger as a co-author without her consent.              She\n\nclaims on appeal that the district court erroneously granted AK\n\nPeters’ JMOL motion on her breach claim based on its mistaken\n\nconclusion that she failed to establish damages from the breach.\n\nShe cites evidence relating to damage to her reputation and damage\n\ndue to AK Peters’ decision to withhold her royalties.                Moreover,\n\nshe argues that even if she did not prove actual damages, “her\n\nclaim for breach of contract should still have been submitted to\n\nthe jury with an instruction on nominal damages.\"7\n\n1.   Actual Damages\n\n           Flynn's claim that AK Peters owes her royalties for the\n\nsecond edition of Mobile Robots cannot support her claim for a\n\nbreach of Paragraph L of the original publication contract (dealing\n\nwith the relationship between the authors/editors and the publisher\n\nover revisions to the first edition of Mobile Robots).           Even if AK\n\nPeters has withheld her royalties to retaliate for this lawsuit,\n\n\n\n\n     7\n      Flynn also cites \"lost wages\" in her brief. However, she\ndoes not actually claim that she has lost wages.     Rather, she\nsimply argues that she will have to spend two years of her life\nwriting a new book to eliminate the current stain on her\nreputation.   Therefore, we consider the wages claim to be an\nattempt to monetize her reputational harm and not an independent\nsource of harm.\n\n                                    -19-\n\fthat alleged breach would constitute a separate breach never relied\n\nupon in Flynn's pleadings and never actually litigated at trial.\n\n             Flynn's allegation of harm to her reputation also fails.\n\nAs the Massachusetts courts have stated, \"[d]amages for injury to\n\nreputation are usually not available in contract actions,\" Daley v.\n\nTown of West Brookfield, 476 N.E.2d 980, 980 n.1 (Mass. App. 1985),\n\nbecause such damages are remote, speculative, and not within the\n\ncontemplation of the parties.            See Redgrave v. Boston Symphony\n\nOrchestra, Inc, 855 F.2d 888, 892 (1st Cir. 1988) (en banc).                We\n\nhave made exceptions to this general rule when plaintiffs have\n\nprovided evidence of specific harm that is proximately related to\n\ntheir reputational injury.        See id. (allowing recovery for harm to\n\nreputation when the plaintiff, an actress, identified specific\n\nmovie and theater performances that would have been offered to her\n\nbut for the breach of contract); see also Jorgensen v. Mass. Port\n\nAuth., 905 F.2d 515, 522 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"Massachusetts might . .\n\n.   decide   to   respond   to   these   foreseeability   concerns    not   by\n\nrejecting reputation-damage claims entirely, but by allowing them\n\nif plaintiffs can show specific identifiable lost job opportunities\n\nor an equivalently particular form of injury.\").\n\n             Flynn failed to make such a particularized showing.            In\n\nfact, her trial testimony undercut her claim that the alleged\n\nbreach of AK Peters harmed her professional reputation.              When she\n\nwas asked whether any person told her that they thought less of her\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\fbecause her name was on the revised edition of Mobile Robots, she\n\nreplied: \"People treat me okay.    Nobody has told me that they think\n\nless of me.   But people have told me they think more of me for\n\nstanding up for this and pursuing this litigation.\"    Moreover, she\n\nwas named a visiting assistant professor at the University of\n\nCalifornia at Berkeley after the second edition of Mobile Robots\n\nwas published, and she admitted in her deposition that she was not\n\naware of having \"been denied any grants or any job promotions\n\nbecause of the second edition of the book.\"          Viewing Flynn's\n\nallegations regarding reputational harm within the context of\n\nMassachusetts case law, we have no difficulty concluding that she\n\nfailed to introduce any evidence substantiating damages from AK\n\nPeters' publication of the revised edition of Mobile Robots.\n\n2.   Nominal Damages\n\n           Flynn is correct that she would have been entitled to\n\nnominal damages even if she could not prove actual damages as part\n\nof her contract claim.    Under Massachusetts law, a person who is\n\ninjured by a breach of contract has a right to judgment even if the\n\nbreach caused no harm. Nathan v. Tremont Storage Warehouse, 102\n\nN.E.2d 421, 423 (Mass. 1951); see also      Restatement (Second) of\n\nContracts § 346 (1979).   If Flynn had raised the issue properly,\n\nthe court should have allowed her breach of contract claim to go to\n\nthe jury with an instruction on nominal damages.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -21-\n\f            We conclude, however, that Flynn forfeited her right to\n\nappeal the court's erroneous conclusion that she was required to\n\nprove actual damages to establish a breach of contract claim. When\n\nAK Peters argued in favor of its motion for JMOL by stating that\n\nshe failed to prove damages, Flynn did not make the nominal damages\n\nargument.      Instead, she argued that she had, in fact, proved\n\ndamages.    Also, she herself asserted that proof of damages was an\n\nessential element of a breach of contract action.8       Hence, she has\n\nunmistakably     forfeited   her   claim   that   the   district   court\n\nerroneously granted JMOL on her contract theory, as well as her\n\nrelated claim of prejudice related to the timing of the court's\n\nruling.9\n\nC.   Jury Instruction on California Statutory Claims\n\n            After the jury had been deliberating for six hours on\n\nFlynn's two remaining claims, the California statutory claims, one\n\nof the jurors sent a note to the court asking it to “explain\n\nParagraph L of the original contract in layman’s terms.”            That\n\n\n\n     8\n      Flynn does not argue to the contrary on appeal. Instead, she\ncites the portion of AK Peters' proposed jury instruction in which\nit stated that she was entitled to nominal damages if she\nestablished the other elements of her contract claim. Flynn cannot\nrely on the proposed instruction of the defendant to meet her own\nobligation to raise the nominal damages issue with the district\ncourt.\n      9\n      Theoretically, Flynn could request plain error review of her\nforfeited claim, see Chestnut v. City of Lowell, 305 F.3d 18, 20\n(1st Cir. 2002) (en banc); however, she makes no such argument on\nappeal, and any such argument would be unavailing.\n\n                                   -22-\n\fportion of the contract provides that 1) the authors are obligated\n\nto provide a revised edition if the publisher requests one; 2) if\n\nthe authors are unable or unwilling to revise the text, the\n\npublisher may hire another person (paid with a portion of the\n\nauthors' royalties) to perform the revision; and 3) the authors may\n\nnot \"unreasonably withhold\" their consent regarding the process\n\nonce the publishers undertake a revision. The contract also states\n\nthat all of the terms of the original contract apply to future\n\nrevisions as if those revisions are the original edition.\n\n            Flynn   told   the   judge   that     she    did   not   think   that\n\nParagraph L applied to the statutory claims because she never\n\nexpressed    any    unwillingness   to     make    the    revisions    herself.\n\nTherefore, she said that the court should instruct the members of\n\nthe jury that contract interpretation is a factual matter and that\n\nit is their job to interpret the language.                Although AK Peters\n\nagreed that the court should leave the interpretation of Paragraph\n\nL up to the jury, it said that if the jurors were to conclude that\n\nParagraph L applied, they should be instructed to apply each\n\nsentence of the contract as they found the facts.                     The court\n\nbrought the jury into the courtroom and the following colloquy\n\nensued:\n\n            THE COURT: I understand the first sentence of\n                   Paragraph L, which says that the\n                   author/editor agrees to revise the work\n                   when the publishers will decide and so\n                   forth to mean as follows: That the\n                   publisher has the right to decide that\n\n                                    -23-\n\f       a revision is desirable. And if he\n       does, the author/editors agree to\n       revise the work and to deliver a\n       revised version within a reasonable\n       period of time.\n\n       In addition, it’s important to note\n       that the last sentence of Section L\n       states that all terms of this agreement\n       shall apply to each revision as though\n       it were the work being published for\n       the first time.     So the same rules\n       apply to the revision as to the first\n       one.\n\n       Does that explanation help you?   Or are there –\n\nA JUROR: No, there’s more.\n\nTHE COURT: I’m sorry?\n\nJURY FOREPERSON: I guess they’re saying it was\n       the middle line, Your Honor.\n\nTHE COURT: The middle?\n\nA JUROR: It says if the editor/author is not\n       willing, available–the publisher has\n       the right to do something.\n\nTHE COURT: Yes. Oh, I see what you mean. It\n       says, Should the author/editor be\n       unable or unwilling to undertake such\n       revision or be deceased, which doesn’t\n       apply there, the publisher may arrange\n       an agreement with the author not to be\n       unreasonably    withheld    for    the\n       preparation of a revised manuscript.\n\n       Now, do you have a question about the\n       meaning of that?\n\nA JUROR: Yes.\n\nTHE COURT: As I read it, what it means is that\n       if the author won’t do what the first\n       sentence says he agrees to do or is\n\n\n                    -24-\n\f                 unable to do so, then the publisher may\n                 do so.\n\n                 Now, the question is a little more\n                 complicated in this case by the fact that\n                 there were two authors to begin with. And\n                 one of them, Mr. Jones, clearly did agree.\n                 And Ms. Flynn contends that she didn’t\n                 agree.\n\n                 I don’t think I can aluminate [sic] any\n                 more   than  I   have   with  as   much\n                 experience as I’ve had with this sort\n                 of–does that help?\n\n          A JUROR: Yes.\n\n          THE COURT: Okay.   Please return and go ahead.\n\nNeither party objected to this instruction, and the jury   returned\n\nto its deliberations.\n\n          Flynn now claims that the court’s instruction contained\n\nsignificant prejudicial errors.   She argues that the court failed\n\nto instruct the jury that the relevance of Paragraph L to the\n\ndispute was a factual matter that the jurors had to resolve for\n\nthemselves, that it misstated the facts by saying that Flynn\n\n“contends she did not agree” to undertake a revision, and that its\n\ninterpretation of the contract foreclosed the possibility that the\n\njury could have concluded that her refusal to consent to the\n\nchanges to the book, including the addition of Seiger as a co-\n\nauthor, was reasonable.\n\n\n\n\n                               -25-\n\f             While we agree that the district court’s instruction was\n\nproblematic,10 Flynn's failure to object when the court issued the\n\ninstruction constituted a forfeiture of her right to object on\n\nappeal.    See Fed. R. Civ. P. 51(c) (stating that a party must\n\n\"object[] promptly after learning that the instruction or request\n\nwill be, or has been, given or refused\"); Gray v. Genlyte Group,\n\nInc., 289 F.3d 128, 134 (1st Cir. 2002)(\"[E]ven if the initial\n\nrequest is made in detail, the party who seeks but did not get the\n\ninstruction must object again after the instructions are given but\n\nbefore    the    jury   retires   for   deliberations.\")   (emphasis   in\n\noriginal).      As we have previously observed, \"[o]ur interpretation\n\nof Rule 51 is quite strict.\"       Connelly v. Hyundai Motor Co., 351\n\nF.3d 535, 544 (1st Cir. 2003).          There is a good reason for this\n\nstrictness.       We enforce our object-or-forfeit rule \"to compel\n\nlitigants to afford the trial court an opportunity to cure [a]\n\ndefective instruction and to prevent the litigants from ensuring a\n\nnew trial in the event of an adverse verdict by covertly relying on\n\nthe error.\"     Cross v. Cleaver, 142 F.3d 1059, 1068 (8th Cir. 1998)\n\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n\n\n     10\n      Flynn's primary breach argument was that the publisher,\ncontrary to the requirement of Paragraph L, never presented to her\nthe revisions that were contemplated.    In short, she was never\ngiven a chance to agree or disagree.      The court's instruction\nseemed to miss this nuance. The court's instruction also seemed to\nobscure the right of the authors reasonably to withhold their\nagreement to revisions.\n\n                                   -26-\n\f             Flynn argues that we should not apply our object-or-\n\nforfeit rule here because she did not have an opportunity to\n\nobject.11    \"As a practical matter,\" she says, \"there was no way to\n\nmake an objection in the time between the Court's question 'does\n\nthat help?', the juror's response 'Yes', and the Court's 'Okay.\n\nPlease return and go ahead.'\" We disagree.               Even in the absence of\n\nan inquiry from the judge about objections from counsel to the\n\ncourt's answers to the jurors' questions, she could have and should\n\nhave objected after the judge finished his instruction but before\n\nthe jurors left the courtroom.              Whatever discomfort counsel may\n\nhave felt about objecting without an invitation, such a response is\n\nrequired if litigants want to preserve their rights.                 As the D.C.\n\nCircuit     noted   in    its     response      to   a   litigant   in   similar\n\ncircumstances:      \"We think he was under the duty to object and, even\n\nat the risk of incurring the displeasure of the trial court, to\n\ninsist upon his objection.         Having failed to do so, it is too late\n\nto urge this as error here.\"             Phillips v. Kitt, 290 F.2d 377, 378\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1961) (per curiam).\n\nD.   Attorney's Fees.\n\n             California Civil Code section 3344, one of the statutes\n\nunder     which   Flynn   filed    her    claims,    includes   a   fee-shifting\n\n\n     11\n      Flynn also argues that Rule 51 does not apply because it was\nup to the jury to interpret the contract and because the court's\ninterpretation of the contract was incorrect as a matter of law.\nHer argument confuses an argument on the merits with an argument as\nto whether we should consider the merits.\n\n                                         -27-\n\fprovision:     “[T]he prevailing party in any action under this\n\nsection shall also be entitled to attorney’s fees and costs.”\n\nFlynn pleaded in her complaint that she intended to seek attorney’s\n\nfees, but AK Peters did not inform her of its intention to do so\n\nuntil the parties met in the judge’s chambers to discuss the jury\n\ncharge.    Flynn claims that this delay constituted a forfeiture of\n\nAK Peters’ right to seek fees under the statute.       Even if the\n\npublisher did not forfeit its claim to fees, she argues that the\n\ncourt’s award of $55,000 was unreasonably generous and should be\n\nreduced.\n\n             In support of her forfeiture claim, Flynn argues that\n\nattorney's fees sought by a prevailing defendant are “special\n\ndamages” within the meaning of Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(g),12 and that AK\n\nPeters forfeited its right to seek special damages by not stating\n\nits intention to do so in its answer to her complaint.           The\n\ndistrict court rejected this novel argument, holding that Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 54(d)(2)13 alone governed AK Peters' claim for attorney's\n\n\n     12\n      Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(g) states: “When items of special damage\nare claimed, they shall be specifically stated.”\n     13\n      Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d)(2) states, in pertinent part:\n2) Attorneys' Fees.\n\n     (A) Claims for attorneys' fees and related nontaxable\n     expenses shall be made by motion unless the substantive\n     law governing the action provides for the recovery of\n     such fees as an element of damages to be proved at trial.\n\n     (B) Unless otherwise provided by statute or order of the\n     court, the motion must be filed no later than 14 days\n\n                                -28-\n\ffees.   On appeal, Flynn fails to cite any authority demonstrating\n\nthat, under California law, litigants must prove the right to\n\nsection 3344 attorney's fees as a separate element of damages, and\n\nwe have not been able to locate such authority.              Concluding that\n\nRule 54(d)(2) controls this case, we affirm the district court’s\n\nconclusion that AK Peters did not forfeit its right to seek\n\nattorney's fees.\n\n          We   review     the   court's    determination      regarding     the\n\nreasonableness of the prevailing party's attorney's fee request for\n\n\"manifest abuse of discretion\" and, barring legal errors, \"we will\n\nset aside a fee award only if it clearly appears that the trial\n\ncourt ignored a factor deserving significant weight, relied upon an\n\nimproper factor, or evaluated all the proper factors (and no\n\nimproper ones), but made a serious mistake in weighing them.\"               Poy\n\nv. Boutselis, 352 F.3d 479, 488 (1st Cir. 2003) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).\n\n          Flynn    does   not   object    to   the   rate   that   AK   Peters'\n\nattorney charged, which the publisher's attorney claimed was below\n\nmarket rates, nor does she claim that AK Peters' attorney billing\n\n\n     after entry of judgment; must specify the judgment and\n     the statute, rule, or other grounds entitling the moving\n     party to the award; and must state the amount or provide\n     a fair estimate of the amount sought. If directed by the\n     court, the motion shall also disclose the terms of any\n     agreement with respect to fees to be paid for the\n     services for which claim is made.\n\n\n\n                                   -29-\n\frecords were not sufficiently specific.      Instead, noting that only\n\nten percent of the pleadings were directly related to the section\n\n3344 claim and that the attorneys only referenced section 3344 in\n\nbilling entries totaling $6,417, she argues that she should only be\n\nresponsible for ten percent of AK Peters’ legal costs.                The\n\ndistrict   court   rejected   this    argument,   concluding   that   the\n\ncomplexity and length of the litigation justified the fees.            It\n\nspecifically noted that the bills represented two years of legal\n\nwork defending Flynn’s section 3344 claim and that AK Peters did\n\nnot present bills for expenses that it incurred while defending the\n\nclaim in the California court.       Most importantly, in our view, the\n\nconsent issue that was integral to the section 3344 claim was also\n\ncommon to all of the claims.         Therefore, we reject her argument\n\nthat there was an abuse of discretion in the district court's fee\n\naward.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -30-\n\f",

After losing her Lanham Act claim at summary judgment, and suffering judgment as a matter of law and an adverse jury verdict on her remaining claims at trial (as well as a judgment against her for attorney's fees post-trial), Flynn raises a bevy of claims on appeal. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We set forth the background, reserving some of the details until the discussion of the individual issues on appeal. Plaintiff-appellant Anita M. Flynn is an electrical engineer and robotics scientist who wrote a book with a colleague, Joseph Jones, entitled <i>Mobile Robots: From Inspiration to Implementation.</i> The book was published in 1993 by Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers, Inc. Shortly after publication, Jones &amp; Bartlett assigned its publication rights to AK Peters, a publishing house named after its principals, Alice and Klaus Peters. The book was a great success, and Klaus Peters asked Flynn and Jones to write a second edition of the book in 1997. Hoping to have the revised edition published by the next spring, Peters suggested that they invite another contributor to help them with the research and writing. Jones and Peters later agreed that Bruce Seiger, a high school teacher, would be added as a co-author and would write a chapter addressing educational applications and curriculum proposals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To confirm this agreement, Peters wrote to Flynn on August 23, 1997, asking if she was amenable to the proposed revision with Seiger's assistance. Flynn responded in a letter dated November 16, 1997:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I received your letter as to the second edition of our book and would be happy to agree to your suggested arrangement &#8212; on one condition. That is, you send me my money for my portion of the royalties on sales from January '97 through June '97 in the next month.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alice Peters responded via letter on December 4, 1997:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thank you very much for your letter of November 16. I am enclosing an accounting of the sales of your book, Mobile Robots, for the period January-June 1997 along with a check for settlement of the royalty for those sales. We are pleased that you have agreed to our suggestion regarding the 2d edition of Mobile Robots. We will be forwarding a contract to you soon for the signature.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The publisher did not directly send Flynn a revised contract. However, it had previously sent Jones four copies of the author contract (one each for Jones, Flynn, Seiger, and AK Peters) and two copies of a contract for the curriculum guide (one each for Jones and Seiger) on October 3, 1997. Jones and Seiger began revising the text even though neither of the two original authors had signed the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flynn did not have any further discussions with AK Peters or its principals while Jones and Seiger revised the text. In fact, she was largely uninvolved in the revision process. Perhaps recognizing her diminished role, she agreed in May 1998 to give half of the royalties from the revised edition to Jones and to split the other half with Seiger.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Jones and Seiger worked together to revise the text, their relationship was not always harmonious. Jones wrote Seiger an e-mail in early August 1998, in which he said that he was planning to drop Seiger as a co-author because \"none of the contributions [Seiger was] uniquely qualified to make appear[ed] in the new edition.\" After they discussed Seiger's involvement in the project, Jones decided not to remove Seiger's name from the book after Seiger agreed to take on more work. At some point, Jones and Seiger decided, with AK Peters' consent, to publish the curriculum guide as a separate book rather than including it as a section of <i>Mobile Robots.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AK Peters sent the book to the printer without Flynn's knowledge in early September 1998. A few weeks later, she asked Jones if she could see a copy of the revised manuscript. In mid-October, well over one month after AK Peters sent the manuscript to the printer, Flynn told Jones that \"[she] looked through the manuscript and didn't see anything that [Seiger] wrote.\" Jones responded that Seiger \"revised [one of the] chapter[s], added the contests section, and contacted virtually every supplier in the yellow pages, data books and trade magazines sections to verify the addresses. He also did a word-by-word review of the whole book looking for typos and inconsistencies.\" Jones noted the difficulties that he and Seiger had in August, but said that \"[Seiger] actually did a tremendous amount of work at the end, without his help it would not have been possible to get the book out by [the deadline].\" Responding to Flynn's concern that Seiger did not write the curriculum chapter, Jones informed her that he and Seiger were going to write that chapter as a separate book.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flynn insisted that Seiger's contribution was \"more in line with an acknowledgment\" and refused to sign the revised authors' contract, even after Jones offered to restructure the royalty distribution. Jones informed Flynn in late October that if she did not sign the contract, AK Peters would exercise its rights under Paragraph L of the original contract, which read:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Author/Editor agrees to revise the Work when the Publisher shall decide that a revision is desirable, and to deliver same within a reasonable time after such request. Should the Author/Editor be unable or unwilling to undertake such revision, or be deceased, the Publisher may arrange in agreement with the Author/Editor not to be unreasonably withheld, for the preparation of a revised manuscript, the cost of which (including such royalties or fees as the Publisher may elect to pay) shall be paid by the Publisher and charged against any first royalties that may accrue to the Author/Editor from the sale of the revised edition. All terms of this Agreement shall apply to each revision as though it were the work being published for the first time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jones claimed that this provision \"basically says that they can publish revised editions of the book and, if [Jones and Flynn] don't help, they will employ whatever help they need and allocate payments accordingly.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flynn sent a letter to AK Peters via certified mail three days later, informing the publisher that she had not agreed to the revised contract. She said that she had reviewed the revised manuscript and found a number of errors but said that her biggest concern was the decision to list Seiger as a co-author. She said that she only agreed to AK Peters' proposed revision because she thought that Seiger was going to write a curriculum chapter and that she refused to share credit and royalties for the revised edition of the book without this contribution. She also expressed concern that Seiger rewrote one of the chapters that was designed to provide an easy introduction to robotics and added an electronic circuit design that would not work. Flynn acknowledged Jones' comment regarding AK Peters' right to revise the text under Paragraph L but asserted that this right was not triggered under the circumstances present at that time. She argued that Paragraph L only gave the publisher discretion to revise when an author was unable or unwilling to participate in a revision. Since Flynn had attempted to participate in the revision, AK Peters could not invoke its Paragraph L rights. Similarly, she claimed that since her objection to listing Seiger as a co-author was reasonable, the publisher could not add him as an author until she was satisfied with his contribution. She said that \"[i]f Mr. Seiger performed his part of the deal, there would be very few problems. He did not.\" Toward the end of the letter, Flynn stated that she would seek appropriate legal relief if AK Peters insisted on continuing with publication of the revised edition as it appeared at that time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AK Peters responded to that letter by noting the contributions that Seiger made to the book and by informing Flynn that it had already sent the book to the printer by the time that she notified them of her objections. It offered to address the errors that she identified by printing an errata sheet and to address the authorship issue by listing her before Seiger.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That arrangement was not acceptable to Flynn. She filed a lawsuit against AK Peters and its principals in the United States District Court for the District of Northern California on December 2, 1998 alleging: 1) violation of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(a); 2) violation of California Business and Professions Code &#167; 17200 (concerning \"unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business acts or practices and unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising\"); 3) violation of the California Civil Code &#167; 3344 (concerning trade misappropriation); and 4) breach of contract.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> After the suit was transferred to the District of Massachusetts, AK Peters filed a motion for summary judgment on all claims on March 14, 2000. The court granted the motion with regard to the Lanham Act claim, and the parties went to trial on the remaining three claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, AK Peters filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law (JMOL) on all three claims after both sides had the opportunity to present their cases, arguing that it was entitled to judgment on the breach of contract claim because Flynn failed to show that AK Peters materially breached the contract and that even if it did breach the original contract between the authors and the publisher, Flynn failed to show that she suffered any damages as a result of that breach. Flynn responded, <i>inter alia,</i> that AK Peters did indeed breach Paragraph L of the original contract and that she had presented sufficient evidence of damages during her trial testimony. After stating that it would reserve its decision on the JMOL motion, the court asked the parties to submit jury instructions that it could use to formulate the jury charge. Flynn's proposed instruction stated that the \"essential elements of a breach\" included \"[d]amage to the Plaintiff arising from the failure to perform.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next morning, prior to charging the jury, the court announced that it was dismissing the contract claim \"on the grounds that there's an absolute dearth of evidence with regard to damage flowing from the breach of contract.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> It denied the motion with regard to the two California state law claims and informed the parties that \"[they] may wish to adjust [their] closing statement accordingly.\" The parties made their closing arguments, the court instructed the jury, and the jury returned a verdict in favor of AK Peters on the two California state law claims. Flynn did not file any post-verdict motions. However, AK Peters filed a motion for $55,000 in attorney's fees under section 3344's fee-shifting provision. The court granted that motion. Flynn subsequently appealed the final judgment on the merits and the award of attorney's fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flynn essentially raises four issues in her appeal. First, she argues that the publisher's use of her name on the book without her consent constituted a violation of the Lanham Act and that the district court applied the wrong standard when it granted AK Peters summary judgment on her Lanham Act claim. Second, she claims that the district court erroneously granted JMOL to the publisher on her breach of contract claim based on its mistaken conclusion that she had not demonstrated damages arising from the alleged breach. Relatedly, she claims that the timing of the court's erroneous JMOL ruling, which the court issued right before the parties presented their closing arguments to the jury, created the misperception in the jurors' minds that she consented to publication and that this perception prejudiced the jury's consideration of her two California state law claims. Third, she claims that the court improperly instructed the jury regarding the meaning of Paragraph L and its relevance to her California state law claims. Finally, she claims that AK Peters waived its right to attorney's fees under the California fee-shifting provision; even if it did not waive its right to fees, she asserts that the district court's fee award was overly generous. We consider these claims seriatim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Lanham Act</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flynn claims that AK Peters violated the Lanham Act by listing her as an author of the second edition of <i>Mobile Robots</i> without her consent. More specifically, she alleged in the district court that \"[t]he misleading use of her name is likely to cause confusion by consumers as well as plaintiff's academic peers in that it will be assumed that she contributed to the revisions and approved of the changes.\" Concluding that Flynn failed to demonstrate that her name \"is so associated with robotics that within the robotic community it has an independent value or meaning,\" the district court granted summary judgment to AK Peters on her Lanham Act claim. Flynn claims that this \"independent value test\" has no basis in First Circuit precedent and that she properly opposed AK Peters' summary judgment motion by citing her experience in the robotics field and by alleging that she is famous within the robotics community.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act creates civil liability for, <i>inter alia:</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any person who, on or in connection with any goods or services,... uses in commerce any ... false designation of origin [which] is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive as to the affiliation, connection, or association of such person with another person, or as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods, services, or commercial activities by another person[.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(a)(1)(A).

IBC/USA (Publications), Inc.,</i> 886 F.Supp. 947, 952 (D.Mass.1995) (\"[S]urnames, when used as trademarks, are inherently indistinctive, i.e., weak [and] are permitted trademark protection only upon a showing that they have become strong marks by acquiring distinctiveness through secondary meaning.\"); 2 <i>McCarthy, supra,</i> &#167; 13:2. According to Professor McCarthy:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Secondary meaning grows out of long association of the [personal] name with the business, and thereby becomes the name of the business as such; is acquired when the name and the business become synonymous in the public mind; and submerges the primary meaning of the name as a word identifying a person, in favor of its meaning as a word identifying that business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> Therefore, before we can consider whether AK Peters infringed upon Flynn's purported use of her name as a trademark, we must evaluate whether Flynn's name has acquired secondary meaning within the relevant class of consumers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Proof of secondary meaning entails vigorous evidentiary requirements.\" <i>Boston Beer Co.,</i> 9 F.3d at 181. The plaintiff must not only show that it used a personal name as a trademark, but that a \"substantial portion of the consuming public associates [the name] specifically with [its] business.\" <i>Id.</i> at 182. Furthermore, the plaintiff must show that these consumers base purchasing decisions upon seeing the trademark (i.e. the personal name) on the product:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To acquire a secondary meaning in the minds of the buying public, a labelled product, when shown to a prospective customer, must prompt the reaction, \"That is the product I want because I know that all products with that label come from a single source and have the same level of quality.\" In other words, the article must proclaim its identity of source and quality, and not serve simply to stimulate further enquiry about it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2 <i>McCarthy, supra,</i> &#167; 15:11. The plaintiff can meet this evidentiary burden through the use of direct evidence, such as consumer surveys or testimony from consumers, or through the use of circumstantial evidence. Since Flynn did not provide any direct evidence on this issue, we will focus on the requirements for circumstantial evidence. A plaintiff may establish secondary meaning for a name by presenting circumstantial evidence regarding: \"(1) the length and manner of its use, (2) the nature and extent of advertising and promotion of the mark and (3) the efforts made in the direction of promoting a conscious connection, in the public's mind, between the name or mark and a particular product or venture.\" <i>Boston Beer Co.,</i> 9 F.3d at 182; <i>see also 815 Tonawanda St. Corp. v. Fay's Drug Co.,</i> 842 F.2d 643, 648 (2d Cir.1988) (including among the factors that may be considered to prove secondary meaning \"advertising expenditures, consumer surveys, media coverage, attempts to copy the mark, and length and exclusivity of use\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flynn submitted for the summary judgment record a copy of her curriculum vitae and an affidavit in which she stated that she has worked in the robotics field since 1985, has given seventy invited talks and written twenty-nine papers in the field, and has founded a company that designs micro robots. Viewed in the proper light, she claims that this evidence demonstrates that \"she has an esteemed reputation and a well-recognized name.\" This claim ignores the stringent requirements for secondary meaning evidence. \"Such `opinion' testimony by a [party] is considered self-serving and of little probative value.\" <i>Fay's Drug Co.,</i> 842 F.2d at 648. It would be more important to know, for example, how likely it would be for the average consumer of books like <i>Mobile Robots</i> to be aware of the papers Flynn cites. It is the mindset of these likely consumers and not simply the strength of her publication record in the abstract that matters in determining whether secondary meaning has attached. Moreover, Flynn declared that the authors intended to market the book to \"a wide audience\" from \"high school age to Ph.D. level researchers\"; therefore, it is this broad class of consumers and not a select subset of academic \"insiders\" that matters for secondary meaning purposes. Flynn failed to produce any evidence demonstrating that this extended group of consumers is aware of her academic achievements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flynn also says in her affidavit that a handful of strangers have told her that they recognized her from a talk or that they had read her book, and her nephew says in his affidavit that a robotics graduate student that he met said that Flynn was \"famous.\" However, such limited anecdotal evidence does little to establish that her name has acquired secondary meaning within the class of consumers who would be likely to purchase a book on robotics, and that these consumers would be more likely to purchase books because her name was on the cover.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flynn's reliance on <i>Donoghue</i> highlights the weakness of her case. In that case, the court enjoined a mailing company from using the plaintiff's name and face in an advertisement after the plaintiff, a financial expert, introduced evidence demonstrating that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[He] is a nationally known investment advisor, with expertise in the subject of money market and mutual fund investing. He has been in the business of providing investment advisory services to the general investing public for approximately twenty-two years. The plaintiff has written ten books on the subject of investment advice and is a nationally syndicated financial columnist. Over the past decade, he has appeared frequently on network, cable and syndicated television shows dealing with financial markets, financial advice, and investments, and, over the past twenty-two years, he has participated in hundreds of seminars and conferences regarding investment strategies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 948-49. He also produced a monthly audio cassette investment advisory service and an electronic mutual fund tracking and analysis service and published a print newsletter, which had 17,000 subscribers and was \"well-known among consumers and in the financial advisory services industry for its analyses of market trends and its mutual fund recommendations.\" <i>Id.</i> at 949. Given this circumstantial evidence, the court concluded that the plaintiff \"has become widely known, due to his efforts during the past twenty-two years, as [a financial] expert\" and that his name \"through numerous publications and determined self-promotion, has become associated in the public mind with expertise in strategic investment advice.\" <i>Id.</i> at 953. Accordingly, the court did not have difficulty concluding that \"the plaintiff's surname has acquired a secondary meaning vesting it with protected trademark status.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flynn's summary judgment offerings do not remotely approach the evidence of secondary meaning presented in <i>Donoghue.</i> If Flynn's evidence demonstrated anything, it is that she has expertise in the robotics field and that a handful of individuals in the field have recognized her name and face. That evidence did not demonstrate that the relevant consumers have associated her name with a product. She did not demonstrate that a reasonable factfinder could conclude that her name serves anything more than its primary function to identify her as an individual. Given this failure to demonstrate that her name has acquired secondary meaning, we must agree with the district court that the Lanham Act does not apply to her claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Breach of Contract</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flynn alleged that AK Peters breached its original publication contract with her by accepting revisions to <i>Mobile Robots</i> and adding Seiger as a co-author without her consent. She claims on appeal that the district court erroneously granted AK Peters' JMOL motion on her breach claim based on its mistaken conclusion that she failed to establish damages from the breach. She cites evidence relating to damage to her reputation and damage due to AK Peters' decision to withhold her royalties. Moreover, she argues that even if she did not prove actual damages, \"her claim for breach of contract should still have been submitted to the jury with an instruction on <i>nominal</i> damages.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>1. Actual Damages</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flynn's claim that AK Peters owes her royalties for the second edition of <i>Mobile Robots</i> cannot support her claim for a breach of Paragraph L of the original publication contract (dealing with the relationship between the authors/editors and the publisher over revisions to the first edition of <i>Mobile Robots</i>). Even if AK Peters has withheld her royalties to retaliate for this lawsuit, that alleged breach would constitute a separate breach never relied upon in Flynn's pleadings and never actually litigated at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flynn's allegation of harm to her reputation also fails. As the Massachusetts courts have stated, \"[d]amages for injury to reputation are usually not available in contract actions,\" <i>Daley v. Town of West Brookfield,</i> 19 Mass.App.Ct. 1019, 476 N.E.2d 980, 980 n. 1 (1985), because such damages are remote, speculative, and not within the contemplation of the parties. <i>See Redgrave v. Boston Symphony Orchestra, Inc.,</i> 855 F.2d 888, 892 (1st Cir.1988) (en banc). We have made exceptions to this general rule when plaintiffs have provided evidence of specific harm that is proximately related to their reputational injury. <i>See id.</i> (allowing recovery for harm to reputation when the plaintiff, an actress, identified specific movie and theater performances that would have been offered to her but for the breach of contract); <i>see also Jorgensen v. Mass. Port Auth.,</i> 905 F.2d 515, 522 (1st Cir.1990) (\"Massachusetts might ... decide to respond to these foreseeability concerns not by rejecting reputation-damage claims entirely, but by allowing them if plaintiffs can show specific identifiable lost job opportunities or an equivalently particular form of injury.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flynn failed to make such a particularized showing. In fact, her trial testimony undercut her claim that the alleged breach of AK Peters harmed her professional reputation. When she was asked whether any person told her that they thought less of her because her name was on the revised edition of <i>Mobile Robots,</i> she replied: \"People treat me okay. Nobody has told me that they think less of me. But people have told me they think more of me for standing up for this and pursuing this litigation.\" Moreover, she was named a visiting assistant professor at the University of California at Berkeley <i>after</i> the second edition of <i>Mobile Robots</i> was published, and she admitted in her deposition that she was not aware of having \"been denied any grants or any job promotions because of the second edition of the book.\" Viewing Flynn's allegations regarding reputational harm within the context of Massachusetts case law, we have no difficulty concluding that she failed to introduce any evidence substantiating damages from AK Peters' publication of the revised edition of <i>Mobile Robots.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>2. Nominal Damages</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flynn is correct that she would have been entitled to nominal damages even if she could not prove actual damages as part of her contract claim. Under Massachusetts law, a person who is injured by a breach of contract has a right to judgment even if the breach caused no harm. <i>Nathan v. Tremont Storage Warehouse,</i> 328 Mass. 168, 102 N.E.2d 421, 423 (1951); <i>see also Restatement (Second) of Contracts</i> &#167; 346 (1979). If Flynn had raised the issue properly, the court should have allowed her breach of contract claim to go to the jury with an instruction on nominal damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude, however, that Flynn forfeited her right to appeal the court's erroneous conclusion that she was required to prove actual damages to establish a breach of contract claim. When AK Peters argued in favor of its motion for JMOL by stating that she failed to prove damages, Flynn did not make the nominal damages argument. Instead, she argued that she had, in fact, proved damages. Also, she herself asserted that proof of damages was an essential element of a breach of contract action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Hence, she has unmistakably forfeited her claim that the district court erroneously granted JMOL on her contract theory, as well as her related claim of prejudice related to the timing of the court's ruling.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Jury Instruction on California Statutory Claims</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the jury had been deliberating for six hours on Flynn's two remaining claims, the California statutory claims, one of the jurors sent a note to the court asking it to \"explain Paragraph L of the original contract in layman's terms.\" That portion of the contract provides that 1) the authors are obligated to provide a revised edition if the publisher requests one; 2) if the authors are unable or unwilling to revise the text, the publisher may hire another person (paid with a portion of the authors' royalties) to perform the revision; and 3) the authors may not \"unreasonably withhold\" their consent regarding the process once the publishers undertake a revision. The contract also states that all of the terms of the original contract apply to future revisions as if those revisions are the original edition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flynn told the judge that she did not think that Paragraph L applied to the statutory claims because she never expressed any unwillingness to make the revisions herself. Therefore, she said that the court should instruct the members of the jury that contract interpretation is a factual matter and that it is their job to interpret the language. Although AK Peters agreed that the court should leave the interpretation of Paragraph L up to the jury, it said that if the jurors were to conclude that Paragraph L applied, they should be instructed to apply each sentence of the contract as they found the facts. The court brought the jury into the courtroom and the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT: I understand the first sentence of Paragraph L, which says that the author/editor agrees to revise the work when the publishers will decide and so forth to mean as follows: That the publisher has the right to decide that a revision is desirable. And if he does, the author/editors agree to revise the work and to deliver a revised version within a reasonable period of time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, it's important to note that the last sentence of Section L states that all terms of this agreement shall apply to each revision as though it were the work being published for the first time. So the same rules apply to the revision as to the first one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Does that explanation help you?

Oh, I see what you mean. It says, Should the author/editor be unable or unwilling to undertake such revision or be deceased, which doesn't apply there, the publisher may arrange an agreement with the author not to be unreasonably withheld for the preparation of a revised manuscript.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, do you have a question about the meaning of that?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A JUROR: Yes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT: As I read it, what it means is that if the author won't do what the first sentence says he agrees to do or is unable to do so, then the publisher may do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, the question is a little more complicated in this case by the fact that there were two authors to begin with.

And Ms. Flynn contends that she didn't agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I don't think I can aluminate [sic] any more than I have with as much experience as I've had with this sort of &#8212; does that help?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A JUROR: Yes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT: Okay.

She argues that the court failed to instruct the jury that the relevance of Paragraph L to the dispute was a factual matter that the jurors had to resolve for themselves, that it misstated the facts by saying that Flynn \"contends she did not agree\" to undertake a revision, and that its interpretation of the contract foreclosed the possibility that the jury could have concluded that her refusal to consent to the changes to the book, including the addition of Seiger as a co-author, was reasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we agree that the district court's instruction was problematic,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Flynn's failure to object when the court issued the instruction constituted a forfeiture of her right to object on appeal. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 51(c) (stating that a party must \"object[ ] promptly after learning that the instruction or request will be, or has been, given or refused\"); <i>Gray v. Genlyte Group, Inc.,</i> 289 F.3d 128, 134 (1st Cir.2002)(\"[E]ven if the initial <i>request</i> is made in detail, the party who seeks but did not get the instruction must object <i>again</i> after the instructions are given but before the jury retires for deliberations.\") (emphasis in original). As we have previously observed, \"[o]ur interpretation of Rule 51 is quite strict.\" <i>Connelly v. Hyundai Motor Co.,</i> 351 F.3d 535, 544 (1st Cir.2003). There is a good reason for this strictness. We enforce our object-or-forfeit rule \"to compel litigants to afford the trial court an opportunity to cure [a] defective instruction and to prevent the litigants from ensuring a new trial in the event of an adverse verdict by covertly relying on the error.\" <i>Cross v. Cleaver,</i> 142 F.3d 1059, 1068 (8th Cir.1998) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flynn argues that we should not apply our object-or-forfeit rule here because she did not have an opportunity to object.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> \"As a practical matter,\" she says, \"there was no way to make an objection in the time between the Court's question `does that help?', the juror's response `Yes', and the Court's `Okay. Please return and go ahead.'\" We disagree. Even in the absence of an inquiry from the judge about objections from counsel to the court's answers to the jurors' questions, she could have and should have objected after the judge finished his instruction but before the jurors left the courtroom. Whatever discomfort counsel may have felt about objecting without an invitation, such a response is required if litigants want to preserve their rights. As the D.C. Circuit noted in its response to a litigant in similar circumstances: \"We think he was under the duty to object and, even at the risk of incurring the displeasure of the trial court, to insist upon his objection. Having failed to do so, it is too late to urge this as error here.\" <i>Phillips v.

Attorney's Fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">California Civil Code section 3344, one of the statutes under which Flynn filed her claims, includes a fee-shifting provision: \"[T]he prevailing party in any action under this section shall also be entitled to attorney's fees and costs.\" Flynn pleaded in her complaint that she intended to seek attorney's fees, but AK Peters did not inform her of its intention to do so until the parties met in the judge's chambers to discuss the jury charge. Flynn claims that this delay constituted a forfeiture of AK Peters' right to seek fees under the statute. Even if the publisher did not forfeit its claim to fees, she argues that the court's award of $55,000 was unreasonably generous and should be reduced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of her forfeiture claim, Flynn argues that attorney's fees sought by a prevailing defendant are \"special damages\" within the meaning of Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(g),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> and that AK Peters forfeited its right to seek special damages by not stating its intention to do so in its answer to her complaint. The district court rejected this novel argument, holding that Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d)(2)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> alone governed AK Peters' claim for attorney's fees. On appeal, Flynn fails to cite any authority demonstrating that, under California law, litigants must prove the right to section 3344 attorney's fees as a separate element of damages, and we have not been able to locate such authority. Concluding that Rule 54(d)(2) controls this case, we affirm the district court's conclusion that AK Peters did not forfeit its right to seek attorney's fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the court's determination regarding the reasonableness of the prevailing party's attorney's fee request for \"manifest abuse of discretion\" and, barring legal errors, \"we will set aside a fee award only if it clearly appears that the trial court ignored a factor deserving significant weight, relied upon an improper factor, or evaluated all the proper factors (and no improper ones), but made a serious mistake in weighing them.\" <i>Poy v. Boutselis,</i> 352 F.3d 479, 488 (1st Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flynn does not object to the rate that AK Peters' attorney charged, which the publisher's attorney claimed was below market rates, nor does she claim that AK Peters' attorney billing records were not sufficiently specific. Instead, noting that only ten percent of the pleadings were directly related to the section 3344 claim and that the attorneys only referenced section 3344 in billing entries totaling $6,417, she argues that she should only be responsible for ten percent of AK Peters' legal costs. The district court rejected this argument, concluding that the complexity and length of the litigation justified the fees. It specifically noted that the bills represented two years of legal work defending Flynn's section 3344 claim and that AK Peters did not present bills for expenses that it incurred while defending the claim in the California court. Most importantly, in our view, the consent issue that was integral to the section 3344 claim was also common to all of the claims. Therefore, we reject her argument that there was an abuse of discretion in the district court's fee award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Prior to trial in the district court, AK Peters claimed that this agreement constituted a separate, superseding contract between AK Peters and Flynn; however, the publisher chose not to argue that point at trial</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> AK Peters has not paid Flynn any of the royalties from the sale of the revised edition of<i>Mobile Robots.</i> It claims that it is waiting for the authors to settle on the final allocation scheme.

After losing her Lanham Act claim at summary judgment, and suffering judgment as a matter of law and an adverse jury verdict on her remaining claims at trial (as well as a judgment against her for attorney's fees post-trial), Flynn raises a bevy of claims on appeal. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We set forth the background, reserving some of the details until the discussion of the individual issues on appeal. Plaintiff-appellant Anita M. Flynn is an electrical engineer and robotics scientist who wrote a book with a colleague, Joseph Jones, entitled <i>Mobile Robots: From Inspiration to Implementation.</i> The book was published in 1993 by Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers, Inc. Shortly after publication, Jones &amp; Bartlett assigned its publication rights to AK Peters, a publishing house named after its principals, Alice and Klaus Peters. The book was a great success, and Klaus Peters asked Flynn and Jones to write a second edition of the book in 1997. Hoping to have the revised edition published by the next spring, Peters suggested that they invite another contributor to help them with the research and writing. Jones and Peters later agreed that Bruce Seiger, a high school teacher, would be added as a co-author and would write a chapter addressing educational applications and curriculum proposals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To confirm this agreement, Peters wrote to Flynn on August 23, 1997, asking if she was amenable to the proposed revision with Seiger's assistance. Flynn responded in a letter dated November 16, 1997:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I received your letter as to the second edition of our book and would be happy to agree to your suggested arrangement &#8212; on one condition. That is, you send me my money for my portion of the royalties on sales from January '97 through June '97 in the next month.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alice Peters responded via letter on December 4, 1997:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thank you very much for your letter of November 16. I am enclosing an accounting of the sales of your book, Mobile Robots, for the period January-June 1997 along with a check for settlement of the royalty for those sales. We are pleased that you have agreed to our suggestion regarding the 2d edition of Mobile Robots. We will be forwarding a contract to you soon for the signature.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The publisher did not directly send Flynn a revised contract. However, it had previously sent Jones four copies of the author contract (one each for Jones, Flynn, Seiger, and AK Peters) and two copies of a contract for the curriculum guide (one each for Jones and Seiger) on October 3, 1997. Jones and Seiger began revising the text even though neither of the two original authors had signed the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flynn did not have any further discussions with AK Peters or its principals while Jones and Seiger revised the text. In fact, she was largely uninvolved in the revision process. Perhaps recognizing her diminished role, she agreed in May 1998 to give half of the royalties from the revised edition to Jones and to split the other half with Seiger.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Jones and Seiger worked together to revise the text, their relationship was not always harmonious. Jones wrote Seiger an e-mail in early August 1998, in which he said that he was planning to drop Seiger as a co-author because \"none of the contributions [Seiger was] uniquely qualified to make appear[ed] in the new edition.\" After they discussed Seiger's involvement in the project, Jones decided not to remove Seiger's name from the book after Seiger agreed to take on more work. At some point, Jones and Seiger decided, with AK Peters' consent, to publish the curriculum guide as a separate book rather than including it as a section of <i>Mobile Robots.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AK Peters sent the book to the printer without Flynn's knowledge in early September 1998. A few weeks later, she asked Jones if she could see a copy of the revised manuscript. In mid-October, well over one month after AK Peters sent the manuscript to the printer, Flynn told Jones that \"[she] looked through the manuscript and didn't see anything that [Seiger] wrote.\" Jones responded that Seiger \"revised [one of the] chapter[s], added the contests section, and contacted virtually every supplier in the yellow pages, data books and trade magazines sections to verify the addresses. He also did a word-by-word review of the whole book looking for typos and inconsistencies.\" Jones noted the difficulties that he and Seiger had in August, but said that \"[Seiger] actually did a tremendous amount of work at the end, without his help it would not have been possible to get the book out by [the deadline].\" Responding to Flynn's concern that Seiger did not write the curriculum chapter, Jones informed her that he and Seiger were going to write that chapter as a separate book.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flynn insisted that Seiger's contribution was \"more in line with an acknowledgment\" and refused to sign the revised authors' contract, even after Jones offered to restructure the royalty distribution. Jones informed Flynn in late October that if she did not sign the contract, AK Peters would exercise its rights under Paragraph L of the original contract, which read:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Author/Editor agrees to revise the Work when the Publisher shall decide that a revision is desirable, and to deliver same within a reasonable time after such request. Should the Author/Editor be unable or unwilling to undertake such revision, or be deceased, the Publisher may arrange in agreement with the Author/Editor not to be unreasonably withheld, for the preparation of a revised manuscript, the cost of which (including such royalties or fees as the Publisher may elect to pay) shall be paid by the Publisher and charged against any first royalties that may accrue to the Author/Editor from the sale of the revised edition. All terms of this Agreement shall apply to each revision as though it were the work being published for the first time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jones claimed that this provision \"basically says that they can publish revised editions of the book and, if [Jones and Flynn] don't help, they will employ whatever help they need and allocate payments accordingly.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flynn sent a letter to AK Peters via certified mail three days later, informing the publisher that she had not agreed to the revised contract. She said that she had reviewed the revised manuscript and found a number of errors but said that her biggest concern was the decision to list Seiger as a co-author. She said that she only agreed to AK Peters' proposed revision because she thought that Seiger was going to write a curriculum chapter and that she refused to share credit and royalties for the revised edition of the book without this contribution. She also expressed concern that Seiger rewrote one of the chapters that was designed to provide an easy introduction to robotics and added an electronic circuit design that would not work. Flynn acknowledged Jones' comment regarding AK Peters' right to revise the text under Paragraph L but asserted that this right was not triggered under the circumstances present at that time. She argued that Paragraph L only gave the publisher discretion to revise when an author was unable or unwilling to participate in a revision. Since Flynn had attempted to participate in the revision, AK Peters could not invoke its Paragraph L rights. Similarly, she claimed that since her objection to listing Seiger as a co-author was reasonable, the publisher could not add him as an author until she was satisfied with his contribution. She said that \"[i]f Mr. Seiger performed his part of the deal, there would be very few problems. He did not.\" Toward the end of the letter, Flynn stated that she would seek appropriate legal relief if AK Peters insisted on continuing with publication of the revised edition as it appeared at that time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AK Peters responded to that letter by noting the contributions that Seiger made to the book and by informing Flynn that it had already sent the book to the printer by the time that she notified them of her objections. It offered to address the errors that she identified by printing an errata sheet and to address the authorship issue by listing her before Seiger.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That arrangement was not acceptable to Flynn. She filed a lawsuit against AK Peters and its principals in the United States District Court for the District of Northern California on December 2, 1998 alleging: 1) violation of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(a); 2) violation of California Business and Professions Code &#167; 17200 (concerning \"unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business acts or practices and unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising\"); 3) violation of the California Civil Code &#167; 3344 (concerning trade misappropriation); and 4) breach of contract.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> After the suit was transferred to the District of Massachusetts, AK Peters filed a motion for summary judgment on all claims on March 14, 2000. The court granted the motion with regard to the Lanham Act claim, and the parties went to trial on the remaining three claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, AK Peters filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law (JMOL) on all three claims after both sides had the opportunity to present their cases, arguing that it was entitled to judgment on the breach of contract claim because Flynn failed to show that AK Peters materially breached the contract and that even if it did breach the original contract between the authors and the publisher, Flynn failed to show that she suffered any damages as a result of that breach. Flynn responded, <i>inter alia,</i> that AK Peters did indeed breach Paragraph L of the original contract and that she had presented sufficient evidence of damages during her trial testimony. After stating that it would reserve its decision on the JMOL motion, the court asked the parties to submit jury instructions that it could use to formulate the jury charge. Flynn's proposed instruction stated that the \"essential elements of a breach\" included \"[d]amage to the Plaintiff arising from the failure to perform.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next morning, prior to charging the jury, the court announced that it was dismissing the contract claim \"on the grounds that there's an absolute dearth of evidence with regard to damage flowing from the breach of contract.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> It denied the motion with regard to the two California state law claims and informed the parties that \"[they] may wish to adjust [their] closing statement accordingly.\" The parties made their closing arguments, the court instructed the jury, and the jury returned a verdict in favor of AK Peters on the two California state law claims. Flynn did not file any post-verdict motions. However, AK Peters filed a motion for $55,000 in attorney's fees under section 3344's fee-shifting provision. The court granted that motion. Flynn subsequently appealed the final judgment on the merits and the award of attorney's fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flynn essentially raises four issues in her appeal. First, she argues that the publisher's use of her name on the book without her consent constituted a violation of the Lanham Act and that the district court applied the wrong standard when it granted AK Peters summary judgment on her Lanham Act claim. Second, she claims that the district court erroneously granted JMOL to the publisher on her breach of contract claim based on its mistaken conclusion that she had not demonstrated damages arising from the alleged breach. Relatedly, she claims that the timing of the court's erroneous JMOL ruling, which the court issued right before the parties presented their closing arguments to the jury, created the misperception in the jurors' minds that she consented to publication and that this perception prejudiced the jury's consideration of her two California state law claims. Third, she claims that the court improperly instructed the jury regarding the meaning of Paragraph L and its relevance to her California state law claims. Finally, she claims that AK Peters waived its right to attorney's fees under the California fee-shifting provision; even if it did not waive its right to fees, she asserts that the district court's fee award was overly generous. We consider these claims seriatim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Lanham Act</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flynn claims that AK Peters violated the Lanham Act by listing her as an author of the second edition of <i>Mobile Robots</i> without her consent. More specifically, she alleged in the district court that \"[t]he misleading use of her name is likely to cause confusion by consumers as well as plaintiff's academic peers in that it will be assumed that she contributed to the revisions and approved of the changes.\" Concluding that Flynn failed to demonstrate that her name \"is so associated with robotics that within the robotic community it has an independent value or meaning,\" the district court granted summary judgment to AK Peters on her Lanham Act claim. Flynn claims that this \"independent value test\" has no basis in First Circuit precedent and that she properly opposed AK Peters' summary judgment motion by citing her experience in the robotics field and by alleging that she is famous within the robotics community.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act creates civil liability for, <i>inter alia:</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any person who, on or in connection with any goods or services,... uses in commerce any ... false designation of origin [which] is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive as to the affiliation, connection, or association of such person with another person, or as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods, services, or commercial activities by another person[.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(a)(1)(A).

According to Professor McCarthy:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Secondary meaning grows out of long association of the [personal] name with the business, and thereby becomes the name of the business as such; is acquired when the name and the business become synonymous in the public mind; and submerges the primary meaning of the name as a word identifying a person, in favor of its meaning as a word identifying that business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> Therefore, before we can consider whether AK Peters infringed upon Flynn's purported use of her name as a trademark, we must evaluate whether Flynn's name has acquired secondary meaning within the relevant class of consumers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Proof of secondary meaning entails vigorous evidentiary requirements.\" <i>Boston Beer Co.,</i> 9 F.3d at 181. The plaintiff must not only show that it used a personal name as a trademark, but that a \"substantial portion of the consuming public associates [the name] specifically with [its] business.\" <i>Id.</i> at 182. Furthermore, the plaintiff must show that these consumers base purchasing decisions upon seeing the trademark (i.e. the personal name) on the product:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To acquire a secondary meaning in the minds of the buying public, a labelled product, when shown to a prospective customer, must prompt the reaction, \"That is the product I want because I know that all products with that label come from a single source and have the same level of quality.\" In other words, the article must proclaim its identity of source and quality, and not serve simply to stimulate further enquiry about it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2 <i>McCarthy, supra,</i> &#167; 15:11. The plaintiff can meet this evidentiary burden through the use of direct evidence, such as consumer surveys or testimony from consumers, or through the use of circumstantial evidence. Since Flynn did not provide any direct evidence on this issue, we will focus on the requirements for circumstantial evidence. A plaintiff may establish secondary meaning for a name by presenting circumstantial evidence regarding: \"(1) the length and manner of its use, (2) the nature and extent of advertising and promotion of the mark and (3) the efforts made in the direction of promoting a conscious connection, in the public's mind, between the name or mark and a particular product or venture.\" <i>Boston Beer Co.,</i> 9 F.3d at 182; <i>see also 815 Tonawanda St. Corp. v.

Viewed in the proper light, she claims that this evidence demonstrates that \"she has an esteemed reputation and a well-recognized name.\" This claim ignores the stringent requirements for secondary meaning evidence. \"Such `opinion' testimony by a [party] is considered self-serving and of little probative value.\" <i>Fay's Drug Co.,</i> 842 F.2d at 648. It would be more important to know, for example, how likely it would be for the average consumer of books like <i>Mobile Robots</i> to be aware of the papers Flynn cites. It is the mindset of these likely consumers and not simply the strength of her publication record in the abstract that matters in determining whether secondary meaning has attached. Moreover, Flynn declared that the authors intended to market the book to \"a wide audience\" from \"high school age to Ph.D. level researchers\"; therefore, it is this broad class of consumers and not a select subset of academic \"insiders\" that matters for secondary meaning purposes. Flynn failed to produce any evidence demonstrating that this extended group of consumers is aware of her academic achievements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flynn also says in her affidavit that a handful of strangers have told her that they recognized her from a talk or that they had read her book, and her nephew says in his affidavit that a robotics graduate student that he met said that Flynn was \"famous.\" However, such limited anecdotal evidence does little to establish that her name has acquired secondary meaning within the class of consumers who would be likely to purchase a book on robotics, and that these consumers would be more likely to purchase books because her name was on the cover.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flynn's reliance on <i>Donoghue</i> highlights the weakness of her case. In that case, the court enjoined a mailing company from using the plaintiff's name and face in an advertisement after the plaintiff, a financial expert, introduced evidence demonstrating that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[He] is a nationally known investment advisor, with expertise in the subject of money market and mutual fund investing. He has been in the business of providing investment advisory services to the general investing public for approximately twenty-two years. The plaintiff has written ten books on the subject of investment advice and is a nationally syndicated financial columnist. Over the past decade, he has appeared frequently on network, cable and syndicated television shows dealing with financial markets, financial advice, and investments, and, over the past twenty-two years, he has participated in hundreds of seminars and conferences regarding investment strategies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 948-49. He also produced a monthly audio cassette investment advisory service and an electronic mutual fund tracking and analysis service and published a print newsletter, which had 17,000 subscribers and was \"well-known among consumers and in the financial advisory services industry for its analyses of market trends and its mutual fund recommendations.\" <i>Id.</i> at 949. Given this circumstantial evidence, the court concluded that the plaintiff \"has become widely known, due to his efforts during the past twenty-two years, as [a financial] expert\" and that his name \"through numerous publications and determined self-promotion, has become associated in the public mind with expertise in strategic investment advice.\" <i>Id.</i> at 953. Accordingly, the court did not have difficulty concluding that \"the plaintiff's surname has acquired a secondary meaning vesting it with protected trademark status.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flynn's summary judgment offerings do not remotely approach the evidence of secondary meaning presented in <i>Donoghue.</i> If Flynn's evidence demonstrated anything, it is that she has expertise in the robotics field and that a handful of individuals in the field have recognized her name and face. That evidence did not demonstrate that the relevant consumers have associated her name with a product. She did not demonstrate that a reasonable factfinder could conclude that her name serves anything more than its primary function to identify her as an individual. Given this failure to demonstrate that her name has acquired secondary meaning, we must agree with the district court that the Lanham Act does not apply to her claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Breach of Contract</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flynn alleged that AK Peters breached its original publication contract with her by accepting revisions to <i>Mobile Robots</i> and adding Seiger as a co-author without her consent. She claims on appeal that the district court erroneously granted AK Peters' JMOL motion on her breach claim based on its mistaken conclusion that she failed to establish damages from the breach. She cites evidence relating to damage to her reputation and damage due to AK Peters' decision to withhold her royalties. Moreover, she argues that even if she did not prove actual damages, \"her claim for breach of contract should still have been submitted to the jury with an instruction on <i>nominal</i> damages.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>1. Actual Damages</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flynn's claim that AK Peters owes her royalties for the second edition of <i>Mobile Robots</i> cannot support her claim for a breach of Paragraph L of the original publication contract (dealing with the relationship between the authors/editors and the publisher over revisions to the first edition of <i>Mobile Robots</i>). Even if AK Peters has withheld her royalties to retaliate for this lawsuit, that alleged breach would constitute a separate breach never relied upon in Flynn's pleadings and never actually litigated at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flynn's allegation of harm to her reputation also fails. As the Massachusetts courts have stated, \"[d]amages for injury to reputation are usually not available in contract actions,\" <i>Daley v. Town of West Brookfield,</i> 19 Mass.App.Ct. 1019, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">980</span></span>, 980 n. 1 (1985), because such damages are remote, speculative, and not within the contemplation of the parties. <i>See Redgrave v. Boston Symphony Orchestra, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"510962\"><a href=\"/opinion/510962/vanessa-redgrave-and-vanessa-redgrave-enterprises-ltd-v-boston-symphony/\"><span class=\"volume\">855</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">888</span></a></span>, 892 (1st Cir.1988) (en banc). We have made exceptions to this general rule when plaintiffs have provided evidence of specific harm that is proximately related to their reputational injury. <i>See id.</i> (allowing recovery for harm to reputation when the plaintiff, an actress, identified specific movie and theater performances that would have been offered to her but for the breach of contract); <i>see also Jorgensen v. Mass. Port Auth.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543065\"><a href=\"/opinion/543065/lisa-jorgensen-v-massachusetts-port-authority-appeal-of-donald-hertzfeldt/\"><span class=\"volume\">905</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">515</span></a></span>, 522 (1st Cir.1990) (\"Massachusetts might ... decide to respond to these foreseeability concerns not by rejecting reputation-damage claims entirely, but by allowing them if plaintiffs can show specific identifiable lost job opportunities or an equivalently particular form of injury.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flynn failed to make such a particularized showing. In fact, her trial testimony undercut her claim that the alleged breach of AK Peters harmed her professional reputation. When she was asked whether any person told her that they thought less of her because her name was on the revised edition of <i>Mobile Robots,</i> she replied: \"People treat me okay. Nobody has told me that they think less of me. But people have told me they think more of me for standing up for this and pursuing this litigation.\" Moreover, she was named a visiting assistant professor at the University of California at Berkeley <i>after</i> the second edition of <i>Mobile Robots</i> was published, and she admitted in her deposition that she was not aware of having \"been denied any grants or any job promotions because of the second edition of the book.\" Viewing Flynn's allegations regarding reputational harm within the context of Massachusetts case law, we have no difficulty concluding that she failed to introduce any evidence substantiating damages from AK Peters' publication of the revised edition of <i>Mobile Robots.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>2. Nominal Damages</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flynn is correct that she would have been entitled to nominal damages even if she could not prove actual damages as part of her contract claim. Under Massachusetts law, a person who is injured by a breach of contract has a right to judgment even if the breach caused no harm. <i>Nathan v. Tremont Storage Warehouse,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2030771\"><a href=\"/opinion/2030771/nathan-v-tremont-storage-warehouse-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">168</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2030771\"><a href=\"/opinion/2030771/nathan-v-tremont-storage-warehouse-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">421</span></a></span>, 423 (1951); <i>see also Restatement (Second) of Contracts</i> &#167; 346 (1979). If Flynn had raised the issue properly, the court should have allowed her breach of contract claim to go to the jury with an instruction on nominal damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude, however, that Flynn forfeited her right to appeal the court's erroneous conclusion that she was required to prove actual damages to establish a breach of contract claim. When AK Peters argued in favor of its motion for JMOL by stating that she failed to prove damages, Flynn did not make the nominal damages argument. Instead, she argued that she had, in fact, proved damages. Also, she herself asserted that proof of damages was an essential element of a breach of contract action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Hence, she has unmistakably forfeited her claim that the district court erroneously granted JMOL on her contract theory, as well as her related claim of prejudice related to the timing of the court's ruling.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Jury Instruction on California Statutory Claims</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the jury had been deliberating for six hours on Flynn's two remaining claims, the California statutory claims, one of the jurors sent a note to the court asking it to \"explain Paragraph L of the original contract in layman's terms.\" That portion of the contract provides that 1) the authors are obligated to provide a revised edition if the publisher requests one; 2) if the authors are unable or unwilling to revise the text, the publisher may hire another person (paid with a portion of the authors' royalties) to perform the revision; and 3) the authors may not \"unreasonably withhold\" their consent regarding the process once the publishers undertake a revision. The contract also states that all of the terms of the original contract apply to future revisions as if those revisions are the original edition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flynn told the judge that she did not think that Paragraph L applied to the statutory claims because she never expressed any unwillingness to make the revisions herself. Therefore, she said that the court should instruct the members of the jury that contract interpretation is a factual matter and that it is their job to interpret the language. Although AK Peters agreed that the court should leave the interpretation of Paragraph L up to the jury, it said that if the jurors were to conclude that Paragraph L applied, they should be instructed to apply each sentence of the contract as they found the facts. The court brought the jury into the courtroom and the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT: I understand the first sentence of Paragraph L, which says that the author/editor agrees to revise the work when the publishers will decide and so forth to mean as follows: That the publisher has the right to decide that a revision is desirable. And if he does, the author/editors agree to revise the work and to deliver a revised version within a reasonable period of time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, it's important to note that the last sentence of Section L states that all terms of this agreement shall apply to each revision as though it were the work being published for the first time. So the same rules apply to the revision as to the first one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Does that explanation help you?

She argues that the court failed to instruct the jury that the relevance of Paragraph L to the dispute was a factual matter that the jurors had to resolve for themselves, that it misstated the facts by saying that Flynn \"contends she did not agree\" to undertake a revision, and that its interpretation of the contract foreclosed the possibility that the jury could have concluded that her refusal to consent to the changes to the book, including the addition of Seiger as a co-author, was reasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we agree that the district court's instruction was problematic,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Flynn's failure to object when the court issued the instruction constituted a forfeiture of her right to object on appeal. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 51(c) (stating that a party must \"object[ ] promptly after learning that the instruction or request will be, or has been, given or refused\"); <i>Gray v.

There is a good reason for this strictness.

Even in the absence of an inquiry from the judge about objections from counsel to the court's answers to the jurors' questions, she could have and should have objected after the judge finished his instruction but before the jurors left the courtroom. Whatever discomfort counsel may have felt about objecting without an invitation, such a response is required if litigants want to preserve their rights. As the D.C.

Attorney's Fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">California Civil Code section 3344, one of the statutes under which Flynn filed her claims, includes a fee-shifting provision: \"[T]he prevailing party in any action under this section shall also be entitled to attorney's fees and costs.\" Flynn pleaded in her complaint that she intended to seek attorney's fees, but AK Peters did not inform her of its intention to do so until the parties met in the judge's chambers to discuss the jury charge. Flynn claims that this delay constituted a forfeiture of AK Peters' right to seek fees under the statute. Even if the publisher did not forfeit its claim to fees, she argues that the court's award of $55,000 was unreasonably generous and should be reduced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of her forfeiture claim, Flynn argues that attorney's fees sought by a prevailing defendant are \"special damages\" within the meaning of Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(g),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> and that AK Peters forfeited its right to seek special damages by not stating its intention to do so in its answer to her complaint. The district court rejected this novel argument, holding that Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d)(2)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> alone governed AK Peters' claim for attorney's fees. On appeal, Flynn fails to cite any authority demonstrating that, under California law, litigants must prove the right to section 3344 attorney's fees as a separate element of damages, and we have not been able to locate such authority. Concluding that Rule 54(d)(2) controls this case, we affirm the district court's conclusion that AK Peters did not forfeit its right to seek attorney's fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the court's determination regarding the reasonableness of the prevailing party's attorney's fee request for \"manifest abuse of discretion\" and, barring legal errors, \"we will set aside a fee award only if it clearly appears that the trial court ignored a factor deserving significant weight, relied upon an improper factor, or evaluated all the proper factors (and no improper ones), but made a serious mistake in weighing them.\" <i>Poy v. Boutselis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200780\"><a href=\"/opinion/200780/poy-v-boutselis/\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">479</span></a></span>, 488 (1st Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flynn does not object to the rate that AK Peters' attorney charged, which the publisher's attorney claimed was below market rates, nor does she claim that AK Peters' attorney billing records were not sufficiently specific. Instead, noting that only ten percent of the pleadings were directly related to the section 3344 claim and that the attorneys only referenced section 3344 in billing entries totaling $6,417, she argues that she should only be responsible for ten percent of AK Peters' legal costs. The district court rejected this argument, concluding that the complexity and length of the litigation justified the fees. It specifically noted that the bills represented two years of legal work defending Flynn's section 3344 claim and that AK Peters did not present bills for expenses that it incurred while defending the claim in the California court. Most importantly, in our view, the consent issue that was integral to the section 3344 claim was also common to all of the claims. Therefore, we reject her argument that there was an abuse of discretion in the district court's fee award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Prior to trial in the district court, AK Peters claimed that this agreement constituted a separate, superseding contract between AK Peters and Flynn; however, the publisher chose not to argue that point at trial</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> AK Peters has not paid Flynn any of the royalties from the sale of the revised edition of<i>Mobile Robots.</i> It claims that it is waiting for the authors to settle on the final allocation scheme.
