This case, which requires us to\n\nassess whether an employee's alcoholism constituted a disability\n\nunder the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), illustrates the\n\ndifficulties     of   invoking   work     as   the   major   life     activity\n\nsubstantially limited by an impairment such as alcoholism.                 The\n\ncase comes to us on an appeal from a summary judgment ruling\n\nagainst the plaintiff.\n\n                                    I.\n\n             We begin our analysis by presenting a brief overview of\n\nthe relevant facts, which are drawn primarily from the district\n\ncourt opinion, the briefs, and the joint appendix.             In reviewing\n\nthe entry of summary judgment, we are mindful that we must view the\n\nrecord evidence \"in the light most favorable to, and draw[] all\n\nreasonable inferences in favor of, the nonmoving party.\" Feliciano\n\nde la Cruz v. El Conquistador Resort & Country Club, 218 F.3d 1, 5\n\n(1st Cir. 2000).\n\n          Plaintiff-Appellant John F. Sullivan has had a history of\n\nproblems with alcohol.     In the mid 1980s, he enrolled in treatment\n\nat the Long Island Shelter Detox Center in Boston.            He joined the\n\nAlcoholics Anonymous program in 1988 and has subsequently undergone\n\nother forms of treatment.        Still, his problems with alcohol have\n\npersisted.\n\n          Sullivan     also   has   a   long   and   seemingly      successful\n\nemployment history in the retail sector.         During the mid 1980s, at\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fapproximately    the   same   time   that   he   was   dealing   with   his\n\nalcoholism, he was working in the Infant-Toddler Department at\n\nJordan Marsh in Boston.       After being laid off from that position\n\nwhen the economy slowed in the late 1980s, he took a series of\n\nretail jobs over the next five to seven years.           Those positions\n\nranged from selling office supplies and jewelry to planning and\n\nstocking the opening of a new health and nutrition store.         While he\n\ndid not stay at any of these jobs for an extended period of time,\n\nhe did not leave them for disciplinary reasons.              Around 1994\n\nSullivan took a sales job with Brooks Brothers in Boston, where he\n\nexcelled and was eventually promoted to a low-level management\n\nposition.   However, he resigned that position in July 1998 because\n\nhe grew unhappy with the work environment and because he wanted to\n\nadvance his sales career.\n\n            Sullivan was hired by Neiman Marcus as a sales associate\n\nin its Boston store in March, 1999.         By June of that year he had\n\nbeen promoted to Assistant Manager of the store's Gift Gallery,\n\nwhere he was responsible for supervising one employee, Ramon Lora.\n\nSullivan remained in this position until Susan Parker, Neiman\n\nMarcus's Human Resources Manager, sent him a letter on September\n\n10, 1999, informing him that he had been terminated effective\n\nAugust 25, 1999.\n\n            Neiman Marcus claims that it made the actual decision to\n\nterminate Sullivan on August 12, 1999 in response to his behavior\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fon the previous day, when he left work to go to lunch with a number\n\nof his co-workers at a local Mexican restaurant.                  Laura Lane,\n\nNeiman Marcus’s Human Resource Coordinator in Boston, was among the\n\nco-workers    who   attended      that    lunch,   and   she   later    wrote   a\n\nmemorandum to Susan Parker detailing Sullivan’s behavior at the bar\n\nand after lunch.        According to Lane, Sullivan ordered a vodka and\n\ncranberry juice with lunch.           He did not consume that drink during\n\nlunch, but she claimed that he was \"acting kind of strange,\" \"was\n\ntalking more boisterous than normal,\" \"didn't seem himself,\" and\n\n\"sounded intoxicated.\"          Sullivan remained in the bar area of the\n\nrestaurant after his co-workers returned to the store.                 According\n\nto Neiman Marcus, Lane reported these observations to Parker later\n\nthat afternoon, but by the time the two spoke, Sullivan had called\n\nParker,    told   her    that   his   father   had   medical   problems,     and\n\nrequested to leave early.         Parker granted his request.\n\n             Later that same afternoon, Ramon Lora supposedly informed\n\nParker that he was resigning his position because he did not\n\nrespect Sullivan and could no longer work for a person he did not\n\nrespect.     He said that Sullivan frequently drank at work and was\n\ndrunk during the day and that Sullivan abused Lora when he drank.\n\nLora also gave this information to Neiman Marcus’s Loss Prevention\n\nManager, Paul Karbowski, and said that Sullivan had been drinking\n\nvodka out of a soda bottle in the Gift Gallery stock room.\n\nKarbowski searched the desk that Sullivan used and found an empty\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fbottle of Absolut vodka and a bottle of Mountain Dew in one of the\n\ndrawers. Based on this information, Parker concluded that Sullivan\n\nhad been drinking during work hours.\n\n            Sullivan did not report to work on August 12 or 13 and\n\ndid not call the store.      Parker called Neiman Marcus's corporate\n\nheadquarters on August 12 and supposedly decided to terminate him\n\non that day.   Sullivan called Parker on August 16 and informed her\n\nthat he had a problem with alcohol and was entering an alcohol\n\nrehabilitation program. According to Sullivan, Parker informed him\n\nthat   he   could   have   the   time   off   from   work   to   attend   the\n\nrehabilitation program, and that he should speak with her when the\n\nprogram ended.      After being discharged from the rehabilitation\n\nprogram on August 24, Sullivan contacted Parker by telephone, and\n\nshe informed him that she needed to talk with him concerning the\n\ntermination of his employment.          Although they agreed to meet the\n\nnext day, Sullivan did not attend the meeting.         Neiman Marcus sent\n\nSullivan a letter on September 10, 1999, informing him that his\n\nemployment had been terminated on August 25, 1999, for violation of\n\ncompany policies concerning the use of alcohol on the job.\n\n            Sullivan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment\n\nOpportunity Commission (EEOC) on April 18, 2000 and received a\n\nright to sue letter on May 31, 2001.          He then filed suit against\n\nNeiman Marcus in the United States District Court, alleging that\n\nNeiman Marcus failed to make a reasonable accommodation to his\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fdisability or, in the alternative, that it illegally discriminated\n\nagainst him in response to his disability.         Neiman Marcus claimed\n\nthat he had been fired because he had consumed alcohol during the\n\nwork day in violation of company rules and not because he was an\n\nalcoholic.    It also claimed that the decision to terminate him had\n\nbeen made before he notified the company that he was entering the\n\nrehabilitation program to address an alcohol problem.                  On this\n\nbasis, with appropriate supporting documentation, Neiman Marcus\n\nsought summary judgment.\n\n             In response, submitting his own documentation, Sullivan\n\ndenied drinking on the job and denied the misconduct attributed to\n\nhim by co-workers on August 11 during and after the lunch at the\n\nMexican restaurant.      For a variety of reasons set forth in the\n\nsummary    judgment   record,   he   insisted   that   the    Neiman    Marcus\n\ninvestigation into his misconduct was inadequate.            Although he did\n\nnot dispute that he put the vodka bottle in his desk found by\n\nNeiman Marcus's Loss Prevention Manager, Paul Karbowski, he said\n\nthat his brother borrowed his suit jacket and put the bottle in the\n\ninside pocket of the jacket when he was done.           Sullivan then put\n\nthe vodka bottle in the desk but insists that he did not drink the\n\nalcohol.     More generally, Sullivan claimed that Neiman Marcus did\n\nnot decide to terminate him for misconduct on August 12.           Instead,\n\nthey decided to terminate him after he informed the company on\n\nAugust 16 that he had to undergo treatment for alcoholism.              In his\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fview, the company made that decision because of its concerns about\n\nhis alcoholism rather than misconduct on the job.\n\n            After reviewing the summary judgment record, the district\n\ncourt    granted   summary   judgment    in   favor    of   Neiman   Marcus,\n\nconcluding that \"[t]here is no evidence from which a reasonable\n\nfactfinder could infer that plaintiff was fired for a disability\n\n(i.e., alcoholism) rather than his employer's rational belief, even\n\nif mistaken, . . . that he engaged in on-the-job possession of\n\nalcohol and intoxication in violation of company policy.\"                  This\n\nappeal followed.\n\n                                   II.\n\n            Although   Neiman   Marcus   defends      the   ground   for    the\n\ndistrict court decision on appeal, it focuses initially on a\n\ndifferent ground for affirmance--the absence of evidence in the\n\nsummary judgment record that Sullivan was disabled within the\n\nmeaning of the ADA.1    We may affirm the \"district court's grant of\n\nsummary judgment on any basis that is manifest in the record.\"\n\nJohn G. Danielson, Inc. v. Winchester-Conant Props., Inc., 322 F.3d\n\n26, 37 (1st Cir. 2003).      \"Further, it is well settled that [t]he\n\nmere existence of a scintilla of evidence is insufficient to defeat\n\n\n     1\n      Unfortunately, Sullivan did not address this issue in his\nopening appellate brief and did not file a reply brief. He also\nfailed to raise his \"failure to accommodate\" claim on appeal;\ntherefore, we consider that issue to be waived. See Cashmere &\nCamel Hair Mfrs. Inst. v. Saks Fifth Ave., 284 F.3d 302, 309 (1st\nCir. 2002).\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fa properly supported motion for summary judgment.                Consequently, a\n\nparty opposing summary judgment must present definite, competent\n\nevidence to rebut the motion.\"            Torres v. E.I. Dupont De Nemours &\n\nCo., 219 F.3d 13, 18 (1st Cir. 2000) (internal quotations and\n\ncitations omitted).          We choose to focus on the disability issue,\n\nwhich is largely unencumbered by the dispute over historical facts\n\nin the summary judgment record.           In so doing, we do not necessarily\n\nmean to express disagreement with the district court's alternative\n\nrationale.\n\n             Title I of the Americans With Disabilities Act (codified\n\nat    42    U.S.C.     §    12112)   prohibits     covered      employers     from\n\n\"discriminat[ing] against a qualified individual with a disability\n\nbecause of the disability of such individual in regard to job\n\napplication procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of\n\nemployees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms,\n\nconditions, and privileges of employment.\"                 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a).\n\nThe   ADA    defines       \"disability\"    as:   \"a)   a    physical    or   mental\n\nimpairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life\n\nactivities of an individual; b) a record of such an impairment; or\n\nc) being regarded as having such an impairment.\"                       42 U.S.C. §\n\n12102(2).      Sullivan did not allege that he had a record of\n\ndisability as defined under the ADA; therefore, we will only\n\nconsider whether the summary judgment record established that he\n\n\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fhad an actual impairment or whether the company regarded him as\n\nbeing impaired.\n\nA.   Actual Impairment\n\n           As we have previously held, \"[t]here is no question that\n\nalcoholism is an impairment . . . under the ADA.\"                   Bailey v.\n\nGeorgia-Pacific    Corp.,     306   F.3d   1162,   1167    (1st   Cir.   2002).\n\nHowever, mere impairment without more is insufficient to establish\n\nthat a claimant is disabled under the ADA.                In order to have a\n\nviable claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate that his impairment\n\nsubstantially limits one or more of his major life activities.\n\nToyota Motor Mfg., Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184, 195,\n\n(2002); Lessard v. Osram Sylvania, Inc., 175 F.3d 193, 197 (1st\n\nCir. 1999) (\"Under the ADA, not all impairments lead to protection.\n\nOnly those impairments which substantially limit a major life\n\nactivity do so.\") (citation omitted).           Major life activities are\n\nthose activities that are of \"central importance to daily life.\"\n\nToyota Motor Mfg., 534 U.S. at 197.            These include, inter alia,\n\nbasic   actions   such   as   seeing,      hearing,   speaking,    breathing,\n\nperforming manual tasks, lifting, and reaching.               29 C.F.R. Pt.\n\n1630, App. (2004).\n\n           Sullivan claims that work was the major life activity\n\nthat was substantially impaired by his alcoholism.            We will, as we\n\nhave done in the past, assume without deciding that work may\n\nconstitute a major life activity. See, e.g., Whitlock v. Mac-Gray,\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fInc., 345 F.3d 44, 46 n.1 (1st Cir. 2003); Bailey, 306 F.3d at 1168\n\nn.5; Carroll v. Xerox Corp., 294 F.3d 231, 239 n.7 (1st Cir. 2002);\n\nGelabert-Ladenheim v. American Airlines, Inc., 252 F.3d 54, 58 (1st\n\nCir. 2001).          We take this approach because the Supreme Court has\n\nnot yet accepted work as a major life activity within the meaning\n\nof the ADA.      See, e.g., Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S.\n\n471, 492 (1999) (\"[a]ssuming without deciding that working is a\n\nmajor life activity\" because both parties accepted that it was and\n\nbecause that determination was not essential to the case). Indeed,\n\nthe    Supreme       Court   has      observed   that      there    are       \"conceptual\n\ndifficulties inherent in the argument that working could be a major\n\nlife activity\" under the ADA.             Toyota Motor Mfg., 534 U.S. at 200.2\n\nIn our view, one of these difficulties poses a significant Catch-22\n\ndilemma for an ADA claimant such as Sullivan.                      To be eligible for\n\nADA protection,         he     must   demonstrate     that    he    is    a    \"qualified\n\nindividual\" for the position at issue. See 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a)\n\n(\"No       covered    entity    shall     discriminate       against      a     qualified\n\nindividual      with    a    disability.    .    .   .\")   (emphasis      added);     see\n\ngenerally id. at § 12111(8) (defining \"qualified individual with a\n\n\n       2\n      In Toyota Motor Mfg., the Court did not elaborate on these\ndifficulties, but it referenced its Sutton opinion in which it\nobserved that \"it seems 'to argue in a circle to say that if one is\nexcluded . . . by reason of [an impairment, from working with\nothers] . . . then that exclusion constitutes an impairment, when\nthe question you're asking is, whether the exclusion itself is by\nreason of handicap.'\" Sutton, 527 U.S. at 492 (quoting Tr. of Oral\nArg. in School Bd. v. Arline, O.T. 1986, No. 85-1277, at 15\n(argument of Solicitor General)).\n\n                                          -10-\n\fdisability\" as \"an individual with a disability who, with or\n\nwithout   reasonable     accommodation,      can   perform   the     essential\n\nfunctions of the employment position that such individual holds or\n\ndesires\").        By   demonstrating   that    his   ability    to   work   is\n\nsubstantially impaired, he may demonstrate that he is unqualified\n\nfor the job and, therefore, excluded from ADA protection.               If he\n\ndoes not introduce such evidence, however, he may fail to show that\n\nhe was substantially impaired.3\n\n             An   employee   who   claims   that   alcoholism   impairs     his\n\nability to work faces this conundrum in statutory form.               The ADA\n\nexplicitly allows an employer to \"hold an employee who . . . is an\n\nalcoholic to the same qualification standards for employment or job\n\nperformance and behavior that such entity holds other employees,\n\neven if any unsatisfactory performance or behavior is related to\n\nthe . . . alcoholism of such employee.\"              42 U.S.C. § 12114(c).\n\nThis statutory provision means that an employee who tries to use\n\ndeficiencies in his job performance as evidence that alcoholism\n\nsubstantially impairs his ability to work is likely to establish\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      We recently made the same point in Calero-Cerezo v. United\nStates Dep't Justice, No. 02-2643, 2004 WL 67928, at *13 (1st Cir.\nJan. 14, 2004); see also Steven S. Locke, The Incredible Shrinking\nProtected Class: Redefining the Scope of Disability under the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act, 68 U. Colo. L. Rev. 107, 127\n(1997) (\"Employers are more frequently using this dilemma to their\nadvantage, arguing both that a plaintiff is not disabled, and that\nshe is so disabled that she is not qualified.\").\n\n                                     -11-\n\fthe unhelpful proposition, for ADA coverage, that he cannot meet\n\nthe legitimate requirements of the job.\n\n          Even if Sullivan could navigate these conceptual hurdles,\n\nhe still must make a \"weighty showing\" to prove that his impairment\n\nsubstantially interferes with his ability to work.                        Bailey, 306\n\nF.3d at 1168.    \"Proof that an individual cannot 'perform a single,\n\nparticular    job    does    not    constitute      [proof    of]    a    substantial\n\nlimitation in the major life activity of working.'\" Id. (quoting\n\nLebrón-Torres v. Whitehall Labs., 251 F.3d 236, 240 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).    Instead,      the    claimant      must    demonstrate         that   he     is\n\n\"significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class\n\nof jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to\n\nthe   average    person      having     comparable       training,        skills     and\n\nabilities.\"      Bailey,      306   F.3d    at   1168    (quoting        29   C.F.R.    §\n\n1630.2(j)(3)(i))      (emphasis       in   original).         This   demonstration\n\ngenerally requires the introduction of evidence on the \"accessible\n\ngeographic    area,    the    numbers      and   types   of   jobs       in   the   area\n\nforeclosed due to the impairment, and the types of training,\n\nskills, and abilities required by the jobs.\"                  Bailey, 306 F.3d at\n\n1168 (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(3)(ii)(A)-(C)). Accordingly, if\n\n\"jobs utilizing [his] skills (but perhaps not his . . . unique\n\ntalents) are available, [he] is not precluded from a substantial\n\nclass of jobs.      Similarly, if a host of different types of jobs are\n\navailable, [he] is not precluded from a broad range of jobs.\"\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\fSutton, 527 U.S. at 492.        Finally, he must also show that he is not\n\njust temporarily precluded from those jobs; he must show that the\n\nimpact of his impairment is permanent or at least that it is long\n\nterm.      Toyota Motor Mfg., 534 U.S. at 198 (citing 29 CFR §§\n\n1630.2(j)(2)(ii)-(iii)).\n\n           Sullivan has not come close to presenting such evidence.\n\nIndeed, perhaps     aware      of   the    danger   that    his    evidence     might\n\nestablish that he was unqualified for the job at Neiman Marcus, he\n\npresented virtually no evidence demonstrating that his alcoholism\n\nhad a deleterious effect on his ability to work at Neiman Marcus or\n\nelsewhere.     In   fact,      Sullivan     presented      significant     evidence\n\ndemonstrating that his alcoholism has not interfered with his\n\nability to work. In response to a deposition question, he insisted\n\nthat \"I was doing a satisfactory job [at Neiman Marcus] before I\n\nwent into treatment.        I felt I would be a much better employee\n\nafter going to treatment.\"                When he was asked to elaborate,\n\nSullivan added:     \"I believe that I gained some spiritual growth\n\nwhile I was in treatment and I was going to take that to help\n\nperform my   job    better.\"        When    asked   whether       his   \"alcoholism\n\nlimit[s]   [him]    in   any    way   from     doing    just      things   in    life\n\ngenerally,\" Sullivan replied that \"if it was untreated . . . it\n\ncould begin to affect my professional life\" and that \"I wouldn't be\n\nat my peak performance levels.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\f            Sullivan also testified that he worked successfully at\n\nother jobs both before and after his time at Neiman Marcus.                At\n\nBrooks Brothers, he was one of the top two sellers in Boston and\n\namong the top thirty-eight in the nation.           After he left Neiman\n\nMarcus, he worked thirty hours per week as a bus driver and\n\noccasionally as a server with a catering company.               He further\n\ntestified at his deposition that he expected his bus job to turn\n\ninto a full-time position. Considering all of this evidence in the\n\nlight most favorable to Sullivan, there is simply no showing here\n\nthat his alcoholism has substantially interfered with his ability\n\nto work.\n\nB.     Regarded As Being Impaired\n\n             We also cannot conclude that Neiman Marcus regarded\n\nSullivan as being substantially impaired within the meaning of the\n\nADA.     By protecting employees from discrimination based on their\n\nemployer's mistaken impression that they are disabled, Congress\n\nrecognized that \"'society's accumulated myths and fears about\n\ndisability and disease are as handicapping as are the physical\n\nlimitations that flow from actual impairment.'\"          Sutton, 527 U.S.\n\nat 489 (quoting School Bd. of Nassau Cty. v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273,\n\n284 (1987)).    See also Sutton, 527 U.S. at 484-90 (stating that the\n\n\"purpose of the regarded as prong is to cover individuals 'rejected\n\nfrom a job because of the myths, fears and stereotypes associated\n\nwith    disabilities'\")   (quoting    29   C.F.R.   §   1630,   App.   &   §\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\f1630.2(l)).       Accordingly, there are two ways in which an employee\n\ncan demonstrate that his employer regarded him as disabled:\n\n              (1) a covered entity mistakenly believes that\n              a person has a physical impairment that\n              substantially limits one or more major life\n              activities, or\n              (2) a covered entity mistakenly believes that\n              an    actual,     nonlimiting     impairment\n              substantially limits one or more major life\n              activities.\n\nSutton, 527 U.S. at 489.\n\n              Alcoholics    can   be    fully-functioning       and    productive\n\nemployees who do not experience any substantial limitation in their\n\nability to work. Employers who harbor misperceptions and prejudice\n\nabout alcoholics may not recognize the abilities of these employees\n\nand may regard them as being substantially impaired even though\n\nthey are not.      Theoretically, an employee subject to this mistaken\n\nbelief could qualify as disabled under the \"regarded as\" prong of\n\nthe ADA, as elaborated in Sutton, without confronting the Catch-22\n\ndilemma posed by proof of actual impairment, which runs the risk of\n\nestablishing that the employee is unqualified for the job.                     That\n\nis,    Sullivan    could    argue,     as   he    essentially   did,    that    his\n\nalcoholism did not affect his ability to do his job at Neiman\n\nMarcus.       Rather,   the   company       unfairly   believed   that,    as    an\n\nalcoholic, he could not do the job.\n\n              However, this theoretical possibility can founder because\n\nof the proof requirements when working is the major life activity\n\nat    issue   under   the   \"regarded       as\"   prong.    According     to    the\n\n                                       -15-\n\fprecedents,   the   employee     must   demonstrate   not   only    that   the\n\nemployer thought that he was impaired in his ability to do the job\n\nthat   he   held,   but   also   that   the   employer   regarded    him    as\n\nsubstantially impaired in \"either a class of jobs or a broad range\n\nof jobs in various classes as compared with the average person\n\nhaving comparable training, skills, and abilities.\"                Murphy v.\n\nUnited Parcel Service, Inc., 527 U.S. 516, 523 (1999) (quoting 29\n\nC.F.R. § 1630(j)(3)(i)); Bailey, 306 F.3d at 1170 (affirming\n\nsummary judgment based on the plaintiff's failure to demonstrate\n\nthat the employer regarded him as \"unfit for either a class or a\n\nbroad range of jobs\").\n\n            In an answer to an interrogatory, Sullivan claimed that\n\nNeiman Marcus either \"believed that a person who had previously\n\nsuffered from alcoholism could not satisfactorily perform his or\n\nher job, or . . . it simply was not willing to employ someone who\n\nhad the stigma of having either suffered from the disease of\n\nalcoholism or who had the stigma or having been treated in an\n\nalcohol rehabilitation/detoxification facility for alcoholism.\"\n\nWhen he was pressed to explain how he knew that Neiman Marcus\n\nthought that alcoholics could not satisfactorily perform their\n\njobs, he said it was \"[b]ecause of the actions they took [against\n\nhim].\"\n\n            We rejected a similar argument in Bailey, where we\n\nobserved that \"[a] plaintiff claiming that he is 'regarded' as\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\fdisabled cannot merely show that his employer perceived him as\n\nsomehow disabled; rather, he must prove that the employer regarded\n\nhim as disabled within the meaning of the ADA.\"          Bailey, 306 F.3d\n\nat 1169 (emphasis in original).         We concluded that nothing in that\n\nrecord, including      Bailey's     termination,   demonstrated    that     the\n\nplaintiff's employer considered him to be \"unfit for either a class\n\nor a broad range of jobs. . . .\"         Bailey, 306 F.3d at 1170.\n\n            Similarly, Sullivan failed to present any evidence beyond\n\nhis own termination demonstrating that Neiman Marcus may have\n\nbelieved that he could not perform the essential functions of\n\neither a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes.\n\nIn both Bailey and this case, the employers were aware of the\n\nplaintiff's      \"problems   with    alcohol\"   but   claimed     that     they\n\nterminated the plaintiffs for job performance reasons rather than\n\ntheir status as alcoholics.          Even if, for purposes of summary\n\njudgment,   we    accept   Sullivan's    contention   that   Neiman      Marcus\n\nterminated him because of their concern that alcoholism impaired\n\nhis ability to do his job rather than the job misconduct cited by\n\nthe company, Sullivan has not demonstrated that Neiman Marcus\n\nconsidered him to be limited in his ability to work in a broad\n\nrange of jobs required by the rigorous standards of the ADA.4                In\n\n\n     4\n      The approach to the \"regarded as\" prong that the Supreme\nCourt took in Murphy has been subjected to a significant amount of\nacademic criticism.     See, e.g., Claudia Center & Andrew J.\nImparato, Redefining \"Disability\" Discrimination: A Proposal to\nRestore Civil Rights Protections for All Workers, 14 Stan. L. &\n\n                                     -17-\n\ffact, he did not even mention the broad range of jobs requirement\n\nin his brief.   Accordingly, we conclude that Sullivan did not\n\nestablish that the company regarded him as \"disabled\" within the\n\nmeaning of the ADA.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\nPol'y Rev. 321, 328 (2003) (claiming that the \"class of jobs\"\napproach has made it \"virtually impossible\" for a claimant to\nestablish a \"regarded as\" claim); Miranda Oshige McGowan,\nReconsidering the Americans with Disabilities Act, 35 Ga. L. Rev.\n27, 123 (2000) (claiming that the potential class of employees who\ncould state a valid \"regarded as\" claim is \"vanishingly small\"\nbecause, inter alia, \"[n]o employer evaluates an applicant's\nfitness to do some other employer's work\"). However, the Supreme\nCourt has not altered the Murphy precedent.\n\n                              -18-\n\f",

In reviewing the entry of summary judgment, we are mindful that we must view the record evidence \"in the light most favorable to, and draw[ ] all reasonable inferences in favor of, the nonmoving party.\" <i>Feliciano de la Cruz v. El Conquistador Resort &amp; Country Club,</i> 218 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff-Appellant John F. Sullivan has had a history of problems with alcohol. In the mid 1980s, he enrolled in treatment at the Long Island Shelter Detox Center in Boston. He joined the Alcoholics Anonymous program in 1988 and has subsequently undergone other forms of treatment. Still, his problems with alcohol have persisted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan also has a long and seemingly successful employment history in the retail sector. During the mid 1980s, at approximately the same time that he was dealing with his alcoholism, he was working in the Infant-Toddler Department at Jordan Marsh in Boston. After being laid off from that position when the economy slowed in the late 1980s, he took a series of retail jobs over the next five to seven years. Those positions ranged from selling office supplies and jewelry to planning and stocking the opening of a new health and nutrition store. While he did not stay at any of these jobs for an extended period of time, he did not leave them for disciplinary reasons. Around 1994 Sullivan took a sales job with Brooks Brothers in Boston, where he excelled and was eventually promoted to a low-level management position. However, he resigned that position in July 1998 because he grew unhappy with the work environment and because he wanted to advance his sales career.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan was hired by Neiman Marcus as a sales associate in its Boston store in March, 1999. By June of that year he had been promoted to Assistant Manager of the store's Gift Gallery, where he was responsible for supervising one employee, Ramon Lora. Sullivan remained in this position until Susan Parker, Neiman Marcus's Human Resources Manager, sent him a letter on September 10, 1999, informing him that he had been terminated effective August 25, 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neiman Marcus claims that it made the actual decision to terminate Sullivan on August 12, 1999 in response to his behavior on the previous day, when he left work to go to lunch with a number of his co-workers at a local Mexican restaurant. Laura Lane, Neiman Marcus's Human Resource Coordinator in Boston, was among the co-workers who attended that lunch, and she later wrote a memorandum to Susan Parker detailing Sullivan's behavior at the bar and after lunch. According to Lane, Sullivan ordered a vodka and cranberry juice with lunch. He did not consu that drink during lunch, but she claimed that he was \"acting kind of strange,\" \"was talking more boisterous than normal,\" \"didn't seem himself,\" and \"sounded intoxicated.\" Sullivan remained in the bar area of the restaurant after his co-workers returned to the store. According to Neiman Marcus, Lane reported these observations to Parker later that afternoon, but by the time the two spoke, Sullivan had called Parker, told her that his father had medical problems, and requested to leave early. Parker granted his request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that same afternoon, Ramon Lora supposedly informed Parker that he was resigning his position because he did not respect Sullivan and could no longer work for a person he did not respect. He said that Sullivan frequently drank at work and was drunk during the day and that Sullivan abused Lora when he drank. Lora also gave this information to Neiman Marcus's Loss Prevention Manager, Paul Karbowski, and said that Sullivan had been drinking vodka out of a soda bottle in the Gift Gallery stock room. Karbowski searched the desk that Sullivan used and found an empty bottle of Absolut vodka and a bottle of Mountain Dew in one of the drawers. Based on this information, Parker concluded that Sullivan had been drinking during work hours.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan did not report to work on August 12 or 13 and did not call the store. Parker called Neiman Marcus's corporate headquarters on August 12 and supposedly decided to terminate him on that day. Sullivan called Parker on August 16 and informed her that he had a problem with alcohol and was entering an alcohol rehabilitation program. According to Sullivan, Parker informed him that he could have the time off from work to attend the rehabilitation program, and that he should speak with her when the program ended. After being discharged from the rehabilitation program on August 24, Sullivan contacted Parker by telephone, and she informed him that she needed to talk with him concerning the termination of his employment. Although they agreed to meet the next day, Sullivan did not attend the meeting. Neiman Marcus sent Sullivan a letter on September 10, 1999, informing him that his employment had been terminated on August 25, 1999, for violation of company policies concerning the use of alcohol on the job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) on April 18, 2000 and received a right to sue letter on May 31, 2001. He then filed suit against Neiman Marcus in the United States District Court, alleging that Neiman Marcus failed to make a reasonable accommodation to his disability or, in the alternative, that it illegally discriminated against him in response to his disability. Neiman Marcus claimed that he had been fired because he had consumed alcohol during the work day in violation of company rules and not because he was an alcoholic. It also claimed that the decision to terminate him had been made before he notified the company that he was entering the rehabilitation program to address an alcohol problem. On this basis, with appropriate supporting documentation, Neiman Marcus sought summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, submitting his own documentation, Sullivan denied drinking on the job and denied the misconduct attributed to him by co-workers on August 11 during and after the lunch at the Mexican restaurant. For a variety of reasons set forth in the summary judgment record, he insisted that the Neiman Marcus investigation into his misconduct was inadequate. Although he did not dispute that he put the vodka bottle in his desk found by Neiman Marcus's Loss Prevention Manager, Paul Karbowski, he said that his brother borrowed his suit jacket and put the bottle in the inside pocket of the jacket when he was done. Sullivan then put the vodka bottle in the desk but insists that he did not drink the alcohol. More generally, Sullivan claimed that Neiman Marcus did not decide to terminate him for misconduct on August 12. Instead, they decided to terminate him after he informed the company on August 16 that he had to undergo treatment for alcoholism. In his view, the company made that decision because of its concerns about his alcoholism rather than misconduct on the job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reviewing the summary judgment record, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Neiman Marcus, concluding that \"[t]here is no evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could infer that plaintiff was fired for a disability (i.e., alcoholism) rather than his employer's rational belief, even if mistaken, ... that he engaged in on-the-job possession of alcohol and intoxication in violation of company policy.\" This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Neiman Marcus defends the ground for the district court decision on appeal, it focuses initially on a different ground for affirmance &#8212; the absence of evidence in the summary judgment record that Sullivan was disabled within the meaning of the ADA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> We may affirm the \"district court's grant of summary judgment on any basis that is manifest in the record.\" <i>John G. Danielson, Inc. v. Winchester-Conant Props., Inc.,</i> 322 F.3d 26, 37 (1st Cir.2003). \"Further, it is well settled that [t]he mere existence of a scintilla of evidence is insufficient to defeat a properly supported motion for summary judgment. Consequently, a party opposing summary judgment must present definite, competent evidence to rebut the motion.\" <i>Torres v. E.I. Dupont De Nemours &amp; Co.,</i> 219 F.3d 13, 18 (1st Cir.2000) (internal quotations and citations omitted). We choose to focus on the disability issue, which is largely unencumbered by the dispute over historical facts in the summary judgment record. In so doing, we do not necessarily mean to express disagreement with the district court's alternative rationale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Title I of the Americans With Disabilities Act (codified at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12112) prohibits covered employers from \"discriminat[ing] against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12112(a). The ADA defines \"disability\" as: \"a) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of an individual; b) a record of such an impairment; or c) being regarded as having such an impairment.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12102(2). Sullivan did not allege that he had a record of disability as defined under the ADA; therefore, we will only consider whether the summary judgment record established that he had an actual impairment or whether the company regarded him as being impaired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Actual Impairment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have previously held, \"[t]here is no question that alcoholism is an impairment ... under the ADA.\" <i>Bailey v. Georgia-Pacific Corp.,</i> 306 F.3d 1162, 1167 (1st Cir.2002). However, mere impairment without more is insufficient to establish that a claimant is disabled under the ADA. In order to have a viable claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate that his impairment substantially limits one or more of his major life activities. <i>Toyota Motor Mfg., Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams,</i> 534 U.S. 184, 195, 122 S.Ct. 681, 151 L.Ed.2d 615, (2002); <i>Lessard v. Osram Sylvania, Inc.,</i> 175 F.3d 193, 197 (1st Cir.1999) (\"Under the ADA, not all impairments lead to protection. Only those impairments which substantially limit a major life activity do so.\") (citation omitted). Major life activities are those activities that are of \"central importance to daily life.\" <i>Toyota Motor Mfg.,</i> 534 U.S. at 197, 122 S.Ct. 681. These include, <i>inter alia,</i> basic actions such as seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, performing manual tasks, lifting, and reaching. 29 C.F.R. Pt. 1630, App. (2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan claims that work was the major life activity that was substantially impaired by his alcoholism. We will, as we have done in the past, assume without deciding that work may constitute a major life activity. <i>See, e.g., Whitlock v. Mac-Gray, Inc.,</i> 345 F.3d 44, 46 n. 1 (1st Cir.2003); <i>Bailey,</i> 306 F.3d at 1168 n. 5; <i>Carroll v. Xerox Corp.,</i> 294 F.3d 231, 239 n. 7 (1st Cir.2002); <i>Gelabert-Ladenheim v. American Airlines, Inc.,</i> 252 F.3d 54, 58 (1st Cir.2001). We take this approach because the Supreme Court has not yet accepted work as a major life activity within the meaning of the ADA. <i>See, e.g., Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc.,</i> 527 U.S. 471, 492, 119 S.Ct. 2139, 144 L.Ed.2d 450 (1999) (\"[a]ssuming without deciding that working is a major life activity\" because both parties accepted that it was and because that determination was not essential to the case). Indeed, the Supreme Court has observed that there are \"conceptual difficulties inherent in the argument that working could be a major life activity\" under the ADA. <i>Toyota Motor Mfg.,</i> 534 U.S. at 200, 122 S.Ct. 681.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> In our view, one of these difficulties poses a significant Catch-22 dilemma for an ADA claimant such as Sullivan. To be eligible for ADA protection, he must demonstrate that he is a \"qualified individual\" for the position at issue. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12112(a) (\"No covered entity shall discriminate against a <i>qualified</i> individual with a disability ....\") (emphasis added); <i>see generally id.</i> at &#167; 12111(8) (defining \"qualified individual with a disability\" as \"an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires\"). By demonstrating that his ability to work is substantially impaired, he may demonstrate that he is unqualified for the job and, therefore, excluded from ADA protection. If he does not introduce such evidence, however, he may fail to show that he was substantially impaired.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An employee who claims that alcoholism impairs his ability to work faces this conundrum in statutory form. The ADA explicitly allows an employer to \"hold an employee who ... is an alcoholic to the same qualification standards for employment or job performance and behavior that such entity holds other employees, even if any unsatisfactory performance or behavior is related to the ... alcoholism of such employee.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12114(c). This statutory provision means that an employee who tries to use deficiencies in his job performance as evidence that alcoholism substantially impairs his ability to work is likely to establish the unhelpful proposition, for ADA coverage, that he cannot meet the legitimate requirements of the job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if Sullivan could navigate these conceptual hurdles, he still must make a \"weighty showing\" to prove that his impairment substantially interferes with his ability to work. <i>Bailey,</i> 306 F.3d at 1168. \"Proof that an individual cannot `perform a single, particular job does not constitute [proof of] a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Lebr&#243;n-Torres v. Whitehall Labs.,</i> 251 F.3d 236, 240 (1st Cir.2001)). Instead, the claimant must demonstrate that he is \"significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a <i>class of jobs</i> or a <i>broad range of jobs in various classes</i> as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills and abilities.\" <i>Bailey,</i> 306 F.3d at 1168 (quoting 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(j)(3)(i)) (emphasis in original). This demonstration generally requires the introduction of evidence on the \"accessible geographic area, the numbers and types of jobs in the area foreclosed due to the impairment, and the types of training, skills, and abilities required by the jobs.\" <i>Bailey,</i> 306 F.3d at 1168 (citing 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(j)(3)(ii)(A)-(C)). Accordingly, if \"jobs utilizing [his] skills (but perhaps not his ... unique talents) are available, [he] is not precluded from a substantial class of jobs. Similarly, if a host of different types of jobs are available, [he] is not precluded from a broad range of jobs.\" <i>Sutton,</i> 527 U.S. at 492, 119 S.Ct. 2139. Finally, he must also show that he is not just temporarily precluded from those jobs; he must show that the impact of his impairment is permanent or at least that it is long term. <i>Toyota Motor Mfg.,</i> 534 U.S. at 198, 122 S.Ct. 681 (citing 29 CFR &#167;&#167; 1630.2(j)(2)(ii)-(iii)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan has not come close to presenting such evidence. Indeed, perhaps aware of the danger that his evidence might establish that he was unqualified for the job at Neiman Marcus, he presented virtually no evidence demonstrating that his alcoholism had a deleterious effect on his ability to work at Neiman Marcus or elsewhere. In fact, Sullivan presented significant evidence demonstrating that his alcoholism <i>has not</i> interfered with his ability to work. In response to a deposition question, he insisted that \"I was doing a satisfactory job [at Neiman Marcus] before I went into treatment. I felt I would be a much better employee after going to treatment.\" When he was asked to elaborate, Sullivan added: \"I believe that I gained some spiritual growth while I was in treatment and I was going to take that to help perform my job better.\" When asked whether his \"alcoholism limit[s][him] in any way from doing just things in life generally,\" Sullivan replied that \"if it was untreated ... it could begin to affect my professional life\" and that \"I wouldn't be at my peak performance levels.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan also testified that he worked successfully at other jobs both before and after his time at Neiman Marcus. At Brooks Brothers, he was one of the top two sellers in Boston and among the top thirty-eight in the nation. After he left Neiman Marcus, he worked thirty hours per week as a bus driver and occasionally as a server with a catering company. He further testified at his deposition that he expected his bus job to turn into a full-time position. Considering all of this evidence in the light most favorable to Sullivan, there is simply no showing here that his alcoholism has substantially interfered with his ability to work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Regarded As Being Impaired</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also cannot conclude that Neiman Marcus regarded Sullivan as being substantially impaired within the meaning of the ADA. By protecting employees from discrimination based on their employer's mistaken impression that they are disabled, Congress recognized that \"`society's accumulated myths and fears about disability and disease are as handicapping as are the physical limitations that flow from actual impairment.'\" <i>Sutton,</i> 527 U.S. at 489, 119 S.Ct. 2139 (quoting <i>School Bd. of Nassau Cty. v. Arline,</i> 480 U.S. 273, 284, 107 S.Ct. 1123, 94 L.Ed.2d 307 (1987)). <i>See also Sutton,</i> 527 U.S. at 484-90, 119 S.Ct. 2139 (stating that the \"purpose of the regarded as prong is to cover individuals `rejected from a job because of the myths, fears and stereotypes associated with disabilities'\") (quoting 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630, App. &amp; &#167; 1630.2(<i>l</i>)). Accordingly, there are two ways in which an employee can demonstrate that his employer regarded him as disabled:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) a covered entity mistakenly believes that a person has a physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) a covered entity mistakenly believes that an actual, nonlimiting impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Sutton,</i> 527 U.S. at 489, 119 S.Ct. 2139.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alcoholics can be fully-functioning and productive employees who do not experience any substantial limitation in their ability to work. Employers who harbor misperceptions and prejudice about alcoholics may not recognize the abilities of these employees and may regard them as being substantially impaired even though they are not. Theoretically, an employee subject to this mistaken belief could qualify as disabled under the \"regarded as\" prong of the ADA, as elaborated in <i>Sutton,</i> without confronting the Catch-22 dilemma posed by proof of actual impairment, which runs the risk of establishing that the employee is unqualified for the job. That is, Sullivan could argue, as he essentially did, that his alcoholism did not affect his ability to do his job at Neiman Marcus. Rather, the company unfairly believed that, as an alcoholic, he could not do the job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, this theoretical possibility can founder because of the proof requirements when working is the major life activity at issue under the \"regarded as\" prong. According to the precedents, the employee must demonstrate not only that the employer thought that he was impaired in his ability to do the job that he held, but also that the employer regarded him as substantially impaired in \"either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared with the average person having comparable training, skills, and abilities.\" <i>Murphy v. United Parcel Service, Inc.,</i> 527 U.S. 516, 523, 119 S.Ct. 2133, 144 L.Ed.2d 484 (1999) (quoting 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(j)(3)(i)); <i>Bailey,</i> 306 F.3d at 1170 (affirming summary judgment based on the plaintiff's failure to demonstrate that the employer regarded him as \"unfit for either a class or a broad range of jobs\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an answer to an interrogatory, Sullivan claimed that Neiman Marcus either \"believed that a person who had previously suffered from alcoholism could not satisfactorily perform his or her job, or... it simply was not willing to employ someone who had the stigma of having either suffered from the disease of alcoholism or who had the stigma or having been treated in an alcohol rehabilitation/detoxification facility for alcoholism.\" When he was pressed to explain how he knew that Neiman Marcus thought that alcoholics could not satisfactorily perform their jobs, he said it was \"[b]ecause of the actions they took [against him].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We rejected a similar argument in <i>Bailey,</i> where we observed that \"[a] plaintiff claiming that he is `regarded' as disabled cannot merely show that his employer perceived him as <i>somehow</i> disabled; rather, he must prove that the employer regarded him as disabled <i>within the meaning of the ADA.\" Bailey,</i> 306 F.3d at 1169 (emphasis in original). We concluded that nothing in that record, including Bailey's termination, demonstrated that the plaintiff's employer considered him to be \"unfit for either a class or a broad range of jobs....\" <i>Bailey,</i> 306 F.3d at 1170.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, Sullivan failed to present any evidence beyond his own termination demonstrating that Neiman Marcus may have believed that he could not perform the essential functions of either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes. In both <i>Bailey</i> and this case, the employers were aware of the plaintiff's \"problems with alcohol\" but claimed that they terminated the plaintiffs for job performance reasons rather than their status as alcoholics. Even if, for purposes of summary judgment, we accept Sullivan's contention that Neiman Marcus terminated him because of their concern that alcoholism impaired his ability to do his job rather than the job misconduct cited by the company, Sullivan has not demonstrated that Neiman Marcus considered him to be limited in his ability to work in a broad range of jobs required by the rigorous standards of the ADA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> In fact, he did not even mention the broad range of jobs requirement in his brief. Accordingly, we conclude that Sullivan did not establish that the company regarded him as \"disabled\" within the meaning of the ADA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Unfortunately, Sullivan did not address this issue in his opening appellate brief and did not file a reply brief.

Sullivan has had a history of problems with alcohol. In the mid 1980s, he enrolled in treatment at the Long Island Shelter Detox Center in Boston. He joined the Alcoholics Anonymous program in 1988 and has subsequently undergone other forms of treatment. Still, his problems with alcohol have persisted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan also has a long and seemingly successful employment history in the retail sector. During the mid 1980s, at approximately the same time that he was dealing with his alcoholism, he was working in the Infant-Toddler Department at Jordan Marsh in Boston. After being laid off from that position when the economy slowed in the late 1980s, he took a series of retail jobs over the next five to seven years. Those positions ranged from selling office supplies and jewelry to planning and stocking the opening of a new health and nutrition store. While he did not stay at any of these jobs for an extended period of time, he did not leave them for disciplinary reasons. Around 1994 Sullivan took a sales job with Brooks Brothers in Boston, where he excelled and was eventually promoted to a low-level management position. However, he resigned that position in July 1998 because he grew unhappy with the work environment and because he wanted to advance his sales career.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan was hired by Neiman Marcus as a sales associate in its Boston store in March, 1999. By June of that year he had been promoted to Assistant Manager of the store's Gift Gallery, where he was responsible for supervising one employee, Ramon Lora. Sullivan remained in this position until Susan Parker, Neiman Marcus's Human Resources Manager, sent him a letter on September 10, 1999, informing him that he had been terminated effective August 25, 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neiman Marcus claims that it made the actual decision to terminate Sullivan on August 12, 1999 in response to his behavior on the previous day, when he left work to go to lunch with a number of his co-workers at a local Mexican restaurant. Laura Lane, Neiman Marcus's Human Resource Coordinator in Boston, was among the co-workers who attended that lunch, and she later wrote a memorandum to Susan Parker detailing Sullivan's behavior at the bar and after lunch. According to Lane, Sullivan ordered a vodka and cranberry juice with lunch. He did not consu that drink during lunch, but she claimed that he was \"acting kind of strange,\" \"was talking more boisterous than normal,\" \"didn't seem himself,\" and \"sounded intoxicated.\" Sullivan remained in the bar area of the restaurant after his co-workers returned to the store. According to Neiman Marcus, Lane reported these observations to Parker later that afternoon, but by the time the two spoke, Sullivan had called Parker, told her that his father had medical problems, and requested to leave early. Parker granted his request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that same afternoon, Ramon Lora supposedly informed Parker that he was resigning his position because he did not respect Sullivan and could no longer work for a person he did not respect. He said that Sullivan frequently drank at work and was drunk during the day and that Sullivan abused Lora when he drank. Lora also gave this information to Neiman Marcus's Loss Prevention Manager, Paul Karbowski, and said that Sullivan had been drinking vodka out of a soda bottle in the Gift Gallery stock room. Karbowski searched the desk that Sullivan used and found an empty bottle of Absolut vodka and a bottle of Mountain Dew in one of the drawers. Based on this information, Parker concluded that Sullivan had been drinking during work hours.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan did not report to work on August 12 or 13 and did not call the store. Parker called Neiman Marcus's corporate headquarters on August 12 and supposedly decided to terminate him on that day. Sullivan called Parker on August 16 and informed her that he had a problem with alcohol and was entering an alcohol rehabilitation program. According to Sullivan, Parker informed him that he could have the time off from work to attend the rehabilitation program, and that he should speak with her when the program ended. After being discharged from the rehabilitation program on August 24, Sullivan contacted Parker by telephone, and she informed him that she needed to talk with him concerning the termination of his employment. Although they agreed to meet the next day, Sullivan did not attend the meeting. Neiman Marcus sent Sullivan a letter on September 10, 1999, informing him that his employment had been terminated on August 25, 1999, for violation of company policies concerning the use of alcohol on the job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) on April 18, 2000 and received a right to sue letter on May 31, 2001. He then filed suit against Neiman Marcus in the United States District Court, alleging that Neiman Marcus failed to make a reasonable accommodation to his disability or, in the alternative, that it illegally discriminated against him in response to his disability. Neiman Marcus claimed that he had been fired because he had consumed alcohol during the work day in violation of company rules and not because he was an alcoholic. It also claimed that the decision to terminate him had been made before he notified the company that he was entering the rehabilitation program to address an alcohol problem. On this basis, with appropriate supporting documentation, Neiman Marcus sought summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, submitting his own documentation, Sullivan denied drinking on the job and denied the misconduct attributed to him by co-workers on August 11 during and after the lunch at the Mexican restaurant. For a variety of reasons set forth in the summary judgment record, he insisted that the Neiman Marcus investigation into his misconduct was inadequate. Although he did not dispute that he put the vodka bottle in his desk found by Neiman Marcus's Loss Prevention Manager, Paul Karbowski, he said that his brother borrowed his suit jacket and put the bottle in the inside pocket of the jacket when he was done. Sullivan then put the vodka bottle in the desk but insists that he did not drink the alcohol. More generally, Sullivan claimed that Neiman Marcus did not decide to terminate him for misconduct on August 12. Instead, they decided to terminate him after he informed the company on August 16 that he had to undergo treatment for alcoholism. In his view, the company made that decision because of its concerns about his alcoholism rather than misconduct on the job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reviewing the summary judgment record, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Neiman Marcus, concluding that \"[t]here is no evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could infer that plaintiff was fired for a disability (i.e., alcoholism) rather than his employer's rational belief, even if mistaken, ... that he engaged in on-the-job possession of alcohol and intoxication in violation of company policy.\" This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Neiman Marcus defends the ground for the district court decision on appeal, it focuses initially on a different ground for affirmance &#8212; the absence of evidence in the summary judgment record that Sullivan was disabled within the meaning of the ADA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> We may affirm the \"district court's grant of summary judgment on any basis that is manifest in the record.\" <i>John G.

We choose to focus on the disability issue, which is largely unencumbered by the dispute over historical facts in the summary judgment record.

The ADA defines \"disability\" as: \"a) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of an individual; b) a record of such an impairment; or c) being regarded as having such an impairment.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12102(2). Sullivan did not allege that he had a record of disability as defined under the ADA; therefore, we will only consider whether the summary judgment record established that he had an actual impairment or whether the company regarded him as being impaired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

Indeed, the Supreme Court has observed that there are \"conceptual difficulties inherent in the argument that working could be a major life activity\" under the ADA. <i>Toyota Motor Mfg.,</i> 534 U.S. at 200, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118470\"><a href=\"/opinion/118470/toyota-motor-mfg-ky-inc-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">681</span></a></span>.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> In our view, one of these difficulties poses a significant Catch-22 dilemma for an ADA claimant such as Sullivan. To be eligible for ADA protection, he must demonstrate that he is a \"qualified individual\" for the position at issue. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12112(a) (\"No covered entity shall discriminate against a <i>qualified</i> individual with a disability ....\") (emphasis added); <i>see generally id.</i> at &#167; 12111(8) (defining \"qualified individual with a disability\" as \"an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires\"). By demonstrating that his ability to work is substantially impaired, he may demonstrate that he is unqualified for the job and, therefore, excluded from ADA protection. If he does not introduce such evidence, however, he may fail to show that he was substantially impaired.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An employee who claims that alcoholism impairs his ability to work faces this conundrum in statutory form. The ADA explicitly allows an employer to \"hold an employee who ... is an alcoholic to the same qualification standards for employment or job performance and behavior that such entity holds other employees, even if any unsatisfactory performance or behavior is related to the ... alcoholism of such employee.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12114(c). This statutory provision means that an employee who tries to use deficiencies in his job performance as evidence that alcoholism substantially impairs his ability to work is likely to establish the unhelpful proposition, for ADA coverage, that he cannot meet the legitimate requirements of the job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if Sullivan could navigate these conceptual hurdles, he still must make a \"weighty showing\" to prove that his impairment substantially interferes with his ability to work. <i>Bailey,</i> 306 F.3d at 1168. \"Proof that an individual cannot `perform a single, particular job does not constitute [proof of] a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Lebr&#243;n-Torres v. Whitehall Labs.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199418\"><a href=\"/opinion/199418/lebron-torres-v-white-hall-lab/\"><span class=\"volume\">251</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">236</span></a></span>, 240 (1st Cir.2001)). Instead, the claimant must demonstrate that he is \"significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a <i>class of jobs</i> or a <i>broad range of jobs in various classes</i> as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills and abilities.\" <i>Bailey,</i> 306 F.3d at 1168 (quoting 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(j)(3)(i)) (emphasis in original). This demonstration generally requires the introduction of evidence on the \"accessible geographic area, the numbers and types of jobs in the area foreclosed due to the impairment, and the types of training, skills, and abilities required by the jobs.\" <i>Bailey,</i> 306 F.3d at 1168 (citing 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(j)(3)(ii)(A)-(C)). Accordingly, if \"jobs utilizing [his] skills (but perhaps not his ... unique talents) are available, [he] is not precluded from a substantial class of jobs. Similarly, if a host of different types of jobs are available, [he] is not precluded from a broad range of jobs.\" <i>Sutton,</i> 527 U.S. at 492, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118311\"><a href=\"/opinion/118311/sutton-v-united-air-lines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2139</span></a></span>. Finally, he must also show that he is not just temporarily precluded from those jobs; he must show that the impact of his impairment is permanent or at least that it is long term. <i>Toyota Motor Mfg.,</i> 534 U.S. at 198, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118470\"><a href=\"/opinion/118470/toyota-motor-mfg-ky-inc-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Indeed, perhaps aware of the danger that his evidence might establish that he was unqualified for the job at Neiman Marcus, he presented virtually no evidence demonstrating that his alcoholism had a deleterious effect on his ability to work at Neiman Marcus or elsewhere. In fact, Sullivan presented significant evidence demonstrating that his alcoholism <i>has not</i> interfered with his ability to work. In response to a deposition question, he insisted that \"I was doing a satisfactory job [at Neiman Marcus] before I went into treatment. I felt I would be a much better employee after going to treatment.\" When he was asked to elaborate, Sullivan added: \"I believe that I gained some spiritual growth while I was in treatment and I was going to take that to help perform my job better.\" When asked whether his \"alcoholism limit[s][him] in any way from doing just things in life generally,\" Sullivan replied that \"if it was untreated ... it could begin to affect my professional life\" and that \"I wouldn't be at my peak performance levels.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan also testified that he worked successfully at other jobs both before and after his time at Neiman Marcus. At Brooks Brothers, he was one of the top two sellers in Boston and among the top thirty-eight in the nation. After he left Neiman Marcus, he worked thirty hours per week as a bus driver and occasionally as a server with a catering company. He further testified at his deposition that he expected his bus job to turn into a full-time position. Considering all of this evidence in the light most favorable to Sullivan, there is simply no showing here that his alcoholism has substantially interfered with his ability to work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.

Employers who harbor misperceptions and prejudice about alcoholics may not recognize the abilities of these employees and may regard them as being substantially impaired even though they are not. Theoretically, an employee subject to this mistaken belief could qualify as disabled under the \"regarded as\" prong of the ADA, as elaborated in <i>Sutton,</i> without confronting the Catch-22 dilemma posed by proof of actual impairment, which runs the risk of establishing that the employee is unqualified for the job. That is, Sullivan could argue, as he essentially did, that his alcoholism did not affect his ability to do his job at Neiman Marcus. Rather, the company unfairly believed that, as an alcoholic, he could not do the job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, this theoretical possibility can founder because of the proof requirements when working is the major life activity at issue under the \"regarded as\" prong. According to the precedents, the employee must demonstrate not only that the employer thought that he was impaired in his ability to do the job that he held, but also that the employer regarded him as substantially impaired in \"either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared with the average person having comparable training, skills, and abilities.\" <i>Murphy v.

We concluded that nothing in that record, including Bailey's termination, demonstrated that the plaintiff's employer considered him to be \"unfit for either a class or a broad range of jobs....\" <i>Bailey,</i> 306 F.3d at 1170.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, Sullivan failed to present any evidence beyond his own termination demonstrating that Neiman Marcus may have believed that he could not perform the essential functions of either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes. In both <i>Bailey</i> and this case, the employers were aware of the plaintiff's \"problems with alcohol\" but claimed that they terminated the plaintiffs for job performance reasons rather than their status as alcoholics. Even if, for purposes of summary judgment, we accept Sullivan's contention that Neiman Marcus terminated him because of their concern that alcoholism impaired his ability to do his job rather than the job misconduct cited by the company, Sullivan has not demonstrated that Neiman Marcus considered him to be limited in his ability to work in a broad range of jobs required by the rigorous standards of the ADA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> In fact, he did not even mention the broad range of jobs requirement in his brief.
