App. P. 43(c)(2), Attorney General\nEric H. Holder, Jr. has been substituted for former Attorney\nGeneral Michael B. Mukasey as the respondent.\n     **\n          Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f              PER CURIAM.    Petitioner Kelmer Da Silva Neves, a native\n\nand citizen of Brazil, petitions for review of the denial by the\n\nBoard of Immigration Appeals of his second motion to reopen, which\n\nthe Board denied on December 14, 2006.            Neves's first motion to\n\nreopen was denied on December 3, 2003 due to his failure to\n\nexercise due diligence in seeking reopening of a September 25, 2001\n\ndecision by the Board, which dismissed his asylum appeal.\n\n              The second motion to reopen, the denial of which is now\n\nbefore us, was filed on June 30, 2006 and was denied by the Board\n\nas untimely and numerically barred. See 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(A);\n\n8 C.F.R. § 1003(c)(2).       Neves's second motion sought reopening of\n\nthe Board's December 3, 2003 decision.\n\n              The Board rejected Neves's argument that the time and\n\nnumber   limits     should   be   equitably    tolled     so    he   could   seek\n\nadjustment     of   status   under   §   245(i)   of    the    Immigration   and\n\nNationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i).          See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).\n\nThe Board found that while Neves had substantially complied with\n\nthe requirements to show ineffective assistance of counsel under In\n\nre Lozada, 19 I. & N. Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), he nonetheless had\n\nfailed   to    show   that   he   exercised   due      diligence     in   seeking\n\nreopening.\n\n              We need not and do not decide whether the statutory\n\nprovision limiting motions to reopen is subject to equitable\n\ntolling.       Even if it were, the equitable tolling doctrine is\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\funavailable to a party who has failed to exercise due diligence, as\n\nthe BIA found here.            Boakai v. Gonzales, 447 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.\n\n2006) (\"[I]f the equitable tolling doctrine is available at all,\n\nthe    petitioner       must    first   show   that   he   has   acted   with   due\n\ndiligence.\").\n\n               No constitutional claim or issue of law is raised by\n\npetitioner as to the Board's finding of lack of diligence, contrary\n\nto the assertions in his reply brief.1                And where the Board has\n\nmade a factual determination of lack of due diligence not raising\n\nan issue of law or a constitutional claim, under the provisions of\n\nthe REAL ID Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i), (D), we have held we\n\nlack jurisdiction to review the Board's decision.                Ouk v. Mukasey,\n\n551    F.3d 82, 83-84 (1st Cir. 2008); Fustaguio Do Nascimento v.\n\nMukasey, 549 F.3d 12, 18-19 (1st Cir. 2008); see also Boakai, 447\n\nF.3d       at 4.\n\n               The Board further declined to exercise its authority              to\n\nsua sponte reopen.             We have no jurisdiction over this latter\n\ndecision.          Peralta v. Holder, No. 08-2073, ___ F.3d ___, 2009 WL\n\n\n\n\n       1\n          Because the BIA denial was based on a lack of diligence,\nthe claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is not before us.\nIndeed, the BIA found lack of diligence even assuming counsel was\nineffective. Further, even if we had jurisdiction, the ineffective\nassistance claim is waived.     See United States v. Zannino, 895\nF.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory\nmanner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation,\nare deemed waived.\").\n\n                                         -3-\n\f1475557, at *6-8 (1st Cir. May 28, 2009); Luis v. INS, 196 F.3d 36,\n\n40 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n          The petition is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n                               -4-\n\f",
