Gene Carter, U.S. Senior District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n               Torruella and Howard, Circuit Judges,\n               and Schwarzer,* Senior District Judge.\n\n\n\n     F.

David Hilton was convicted of\n\na one-count violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(5)(B), the Child\n\nPornography Prevention Act (\"CPPA\"), on June 30, 2000. In light of\n\nthe Supreme Court's decision in Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition,\n\n535   U.S.      234   (2002),    holding    that   the   government     may   not\n\ncriminalize possession of non-obscene sexually explicit images that\n\nappear to, but do not in fact, depict actual children, Hilton\n\nsought and was granted post-conviction relief under 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2255.        The government appeals.         Because the district court\n\ncorrectly held that the prosecution did not prove an element of the\n\ncrime, we affirm the grant of relief vacating Hilton's conviction.\n\n                           I.    Procedural History\n\n               A.   Indictment, Dismissal and Appeal\n\n               Based on evidence discovered by local law enforcement\n\npursuant to a valid search warrant, a federal grand jury indicted\n\nHilton    on    December   17,    1997,    charging   him   with   a   one-count\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(5)(B).1             Hilton moved to dismiss\n\nthe indictment, arguing that the CPPA violated the First Amendment.\n\nSection 2252A(a)(5)(B) criminalizes the knowing possession of child\n\n\n1\n   The statute provides that \"Any person who . . . knowingly\npossesses any book, magazine, periodical, film, videotape, computer\ndisk, or any other material that contains an image of child\npornography that has been mailed, or shipped or transported in\ninterstate or foreign commerce by any means, including by computer,\nor that was produced using materials that have been mailed, or\nshipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce by any\nmeans, including by computer . . . shall be punished . . . .\" 18\nU.S.C. 2252A(a)(5)(B).\n\n                                       -2-\n\fpornography that has traveled between states or between countries.\n\nHilton's First Amendment challenge involved the definition of\n\n\"child pornography\" in 18 U.S.C. § 2256(8). That provision defines\n\nchild pornography to include \"any visual depiction, including any\n\nphotograph, film, video, picture, or computer or computer-generated\n\nimage   or    picture,   whether     made   or   produced     by   electronic,\n\nmechanical, or other means, of sexually explicit conduct, where\n\nsuch visual depiction is, or appears to be, of a minor engaging in\n\nsexually explicit conduct.\"           18 U.S.C. § 2256(8)(B).          Section\n\n2256(8)(B) was added by Congress in 1996 after finding that \"new\n\nphotographic and computer imaging technologies make it possible to\n\nproduce      by   electronic,   mechanical,      or   other   means,    visual\n\ndepictions of what appear to be children engaging in sexually\n\nexplicit     conduct   that   are   virtually    indistinguishable     to   the\n\nunsuspecting viewer from unretouched photographic images of actual\n\nchildren engaging in sexually explicit conduct.\" Child Pornography\n\nPrevention Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-208, div. A, tit. I, § 121\n\n(1)(5), 110 Stat. 3009-26 (1996) (emphasis added).\n\n             Hilton argued that this new definition violated the First\n\nAmendment by prohibiting some adult pornography -- that appearing\n\nto be of children -- and by virtue of vagueness and overbreadth.\n\nThe district court agreed, holding that the CPPA's \"appears to be\"\n\nprovision was overbroad and left unclear exactly what images were\n\nillegal.     The district court dismissed the indictment on March 26,\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f1998.   United States v. Hilton, 999 F. Supp. 131 (D. Me. 1998)\n\n(\"Hilton I\").     The United States appealed, and this court reversed\n\nand reinstated the indictment.       See United States v. Hilton,       167\n\nF.3d 61 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"Hilton II\").\n\n           B.   Trial and Appeal\n\n           After the Supreme Court denied Hilton's petition for\n\ncertiorari, the case advanced to trial. Hilton waived his right to\n\na jury trial.     After the issuance of a superseding indictment on\n\nJanuary 5, 2000, the district court heard the case against Hilton\n\nover the course of three days.       This court reviewed the district\n\ncourt's findings extensively in United States v. Hilton, 257 F.3d\n\n50 (1st Cir. 2001) (\"Hilton IV\") (reviewing United States v.\n\nHilton, No. 97-78-P-C, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9220 (D. Me. June 30,\n\n2000) (\"Hilton III\")).       Here we concentrate on the evidence at\n\nissue in this appeal.\n\n           The search of Hilton's computer room on November 7, 1997,\n\nproduced a number of pornographic images.        These were found on a\n\nSony Backup Tape, in Hilton's hard drive, and printed up and stored\n\nin a \"gray box.\"    According to Agent Marx of the local police, whom\n\nthe parties stipulated as a computer forensics expert, the Sony\n\nBackup Tape was used to back up Hilton's computer two months before\n\nseizure.    The    Sony   tape   contained   thousands   of   images;   the\n\ngovernment introduced seven of them.         The \"gray box\" contained a\n\nprint-out with four images identical to four in the Sony tape.          The\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fhard drive contained three images, and this court on review found\n\ntwo to be non-explicit.    See Hilton IV, 257 F.3d at 58.\n\n           To prove that these images depicted children, rather than\n\nadults, the government introduced the testimony of Dr. Lawrence\n\nRicci.     Dr. Ricci testified as to the Tanner Scale and its\n\napplication to the seized images.      The Tanner Scale was developed\n\nthrough analysis of many children both in the United States and\n\nthroughout the world and provides a basis for estimating a person's\n\nstage of physiological development.     Dr. Ricci marked on the backs\n\nof the images his opinion as to the children's ages.           In his\n\nopinion, apart from an image that morphed a child's face with an\n\nadult woman's body, the other nine images represented children at\n\nvarious stages of development, ranging from pre-school to young\n\nteen.    See Hilton III, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9220 at *23-26.\n\n            Based on this evidence, the district court found beyond\n\na reasonable doubt that the images satisfied the definition of\n\nchild pornography in 18 U.S.C. § 2256(8).    The court also found the\n\nrequired element of scienter and an interstate nexus.       Since the\n\ncourt did not find merit in Hilton's affirmative defenses that he\n\nwas possessing the images under authority of the government, it\n\nconvicted Hilton on June 30, 2000, and subsequently sentenced him\n\nto forty months imprisonment.\n\n            Hilton   appealed   his    conviction,   challenging   the\n\nconstitutionality of the CPPA and the sufficiency of the evidence.\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fHe reiterated his affirmative defense that he had collected the\n\nimages at the government's request.           Hilton IV, 257 F.3d 50.\n\nHilton   also   claimed   that   the    district   court   erred    in   his\n\nsentencing.     We rejected all but the sentencing claim.          Since we\n\nconcluded that two of the three hard drive images did not qualify\n\nas child pornography or involve the sexual exploitation of a minor,\n\nwe remanded for resentencing because the record did not support the\n\nSentencing Guidelines upward adjustment applied by the district\n\ncourt for possession of \"ten or more . . . items, containing a\n\nvisual depiction involving the sexual exploitation of a minor.\"\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2G2.4(b)(2); see Hilton IV, 257 F.3d at 58.              As for\n\nHilton's constitutional challenge, we noted that we had \"rejected\n\nthis claim on Hilton's earlier appeal.\"      Hilton IV, 257 F.3d at 53.\n\nHilton asked us to reconsider our prior holding in light of the\n\nNinth Circuit's decision in Free Speech Coalition v. Reno, 198 F.3d\n\n1083 (9th Cir. 1999), but we declined to do so.2           Id.     Thus, on\n\n\n\n\n2\n  We noted that \"the Ninth Circuit struck down only those portions\nof the Act making illegal possession of computer generated images\nof fictitious children.\"      Hilton IV, 257 F.3d at 53.        The\ngovernment argues that this language implies that we found Hilton's\nimages to represent actual children. The flaw in the argument is\nthat it is the Supreme Court's Free Speech Coalition, rather than\nHilton IV, which controls and from that case it is clear that the\nlaw in this circuit must change.     No longer can a pornographic\nimage be assumed to depict real children until proven otherwise.\nOur comment in Hilton IV reflected the law of this circuit under\nNolan. Free Speech Coalition together with changing technology has\nsuperseded those precedents.\n\n                                  -6-\n\fJuly 27, 2001, we affirmed Hilton's conviction and remanded for\n\nresentencing.\n\n             On    remand,     the     district     court     sentenced    Hilton    to\n\nthirty-four months of incarceration.\n\n             C.    The CPPA after Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition\n\n             While Hilton's direct appeal was pending, the Supreme\n\nCourt granted certiorari to review the Ninth Circuit's Free Speech\n\nCoalition v. Reno, 198 F.3d 1083 (9th Cir. 1999), a civil suit\n\nchallenging on its face the constitutionality of the CPPA as\n\namended in 1996.        The key challenge, and the one relevant here, was\n\nagainst prosecution for \"child pornography\" that only \"appears to\n\nbe, of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.\"                     18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2256(8)(B).       In Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. 234\n\n(2002), the Court affirmed the Ninth Circuit holding that such\n\nprosecutions      violate      the    First   Amendment's       protection   against\n\ngovernmental abridgement of the freedom of speech. Id. at 258; see\n\nU.S. Const. amend. I.\n\n             The First Amendment does not protect obscenity, Miller v.\n\nCalifornia,       413   U.S.   15     (1973),     or   the    possession    of    child\n\npornography produced using children.                   Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U.S.\n\n103,   110    (1990)      (\"It       rarely   has      been   suggested    that     the\n\nconstitutional freedom for speech and press extends its immunity to\n\nspeech or writing used as an integral part of conduct in violation\n\nof a valid criminal statute.\") (quoting New York v. Ferber, 458\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fU.S. 747, 761-62 (1982) (quoting Giboney v. Empire Storage & Ice\n\nCo., 336 U.S. 490, 498 (1949))).\n\n             The CPPA is not circumscribed by the Miller definition of\n\nobscenity.     Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. at 246.3            Therefore,\n\nsince the \"appears to be\" definition prohibits non-obscene speech,\n\nthe   Free    Speech   Coalition   Court     addressed    the    government's\n\ncontention that the rationale behind Osborne and Ferber extended to\n\nthe criminalization of sexually explicit images that appear to\n\ncontain   children.      Those   two    cases   viewed   the    trade    in   and\n\npossession of child pornography as bearing a proximate link to the\n\nchild abuse that produced the images in the first place.                See Free\n\n\n\n3\n    Congress has responded with amendments to the CPPA in the\nProsecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to end the Exploitation of\nChildren Today Act of 2003 (\"PROTECT\") that specify a class of\nobscene child pornography reaching \"Any person who . . . knowingly\nproduces, distributes, receives, or possesses with intent to\ndistribute, a visual depiction of any kind, including a drawing,\ncartoon, sculpture, or painting, that:\n\n      (1) (A) depicts a minor engaging in sexually explicit\n      conduct; and\n           (B) is obscene; or\n      (2) (A) depicts an image that is, or appears to be, of\n      a minor engaging in graphic bestiality, sadistic or\n      masochistic abuse, or sexual intercourse, including\n      genital-genital,    oral-genital,    anal-genital,    or\n      oral-anal, whether between persons of the same or\n      opposite sex; and\n           (B) lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or\n      scientific value; or attempts or conspires to do so,\n      shall be subject to the penalties provided in section\n      2252A(b)(1), including the penalties provided for cases\n      involving a prior conviction.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1466A(a) (2003).\n\n                                       -8-\n\fSpeech Coalition, 535 U.S. at 249-50. The government presented two\n\ntypes   of   arguments   to   show   that   the   prohibition   on   virtual\n\npornography was indeed proximate to compelling interests; one\n\nargument was based on the injuries allegedly flowing from \"appears\n\nto be\" child pornography and the second on prosecutorial necessity.\n\n             Two concerns motivated the first argument: (1) that\n\n\"pedophiles may use virtual child pornography to seduce children,\"\n\nid. at 251, and (2) that virtual child pornography \"whets the\n\nappetites of pedophiles and encourages them to engage in illegal\n\nconduct.\"     Id. at 253.      Contrary to our earlier conclusion in\n\nHilton II, 167 F.3d at 72-74, the Court held that the availability\n\nof virtual child pornography to child abusers does not provide a\n\nbasis for the prohibition because while \"[t]he objective is to\n\nprohibit illegal conduct . . . this restriction goes well beyond\n\nthat interest by restricting the speech available to law-abiding\n\nadults.\"     Id. at 252-53.    As for the concern that virtual child\n\npornography motivates child abuse, the Court disagreed with the\n\npremise behind the government's argument: \"[t]he mere tendency of\n\nspeech to encourage unlawful acts is not a sufficient reason for\n\nbanning it.\"     Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. at 253.             Because\n\n\"[t]he Government has shown no more than a remote connection\n\nbetween speech that might encourage thoughts or impulses and any\n\nresulting child abuse,\" it \"may not prohibit speech on the ground\n\n\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fthat it may encourage pedophiles to engage in illegal conduct.\"\n\nId. at 253-54.\n\n            The government's second argument was that eliminating\n\nactual child pornography necessitates the prohibition on virtual\n\npornography because virtual images are indistinguishable from real\n\nones.     Id. at 254-55.        First, the government contended that\n\n\"[v]irtual images . . . are indistinguishable from real ones[, and]\n\nthey are part of the same market and are often exchanged.\"                Id. at\n\n254.    The Court found this \"hypothesis . . . somewhat implausible.\n\nIf virtual images were identical to illegal child pornography, the\n\nillegal    images   would     be    driven        from   the    market   by     the\n\nindistinguishable    substitutes.           Few    pornographers     would    risk\n\nprosecution by abusing real children if fictional, computerized\n\nimages would suffice.\"          Id.       To the government's claim that\n\nindistinguishability     meant     that    the     successful     prosecution   of\n\nactual child pornography necessitated criminalization of virtual\n\nchild    pornography,   the    Court      responded:     \"[t]he    argument,     in\n\nessence, is that protected speech may be banned as a means to ban\n\nunprotected speech. This analysis turns the First Amendment upside\n\ndown.\"     Id. at 255.        Thus the Court held that possession of\n\n\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fmaterial that satisfied only § 2256(8)(B) could not be punished.4\n\nId. at 256.\n\n          D.   Post-Conviction Relief\n\n          Based on the Court's ruling in Free Speech Coalition,\n\nHilton filed a motion for post-conviction relief under 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2255 on November 13, 2002.      The magistrate judge hearing the\n\npetition agreed that Hilton was entitled to relief.   United States\n\nv. Hilton, Crim. No. 97-78-P-C, Civ. No. 02-235-P-C, 2003 U.S.\n\nDist. LEXIS 4208, (D. Me.

No.\n\n02-235-P-C, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8130, 2003 WL 21135703 (D. Me.\n\nMay 15, 2003).   The government's appeal has put Hilton's petition\n\nbefore this court.\n\n                           II.   Analysis\n\n          After Free Speech Coalition, the government must prove\n\nthat an image depicts actual children to sustain a § 2252A(a)(5)(B)\n\nconviction.    Both parties agree that the holding of Free Speech\n\nCoalition applies retroactively. See Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288,\n\n307-11 (1989) (exception to non-retroactivity when new rule \"places\n\n\n4\n    The Court applied the same reasoning to find § 2256(8)(d)\ncontrary to the First Amendment.      That section, defining as\nprohibited child pornography \"such visual depiction [that] is\nadvertised, promoted, presented, described, or distributed in such\na manner that conveys the impression that the material is or\ncontains a visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually\nexplicit conduct,\" is not at issue in this case.\n\n                                 -11-\n\fcertain kinds of primary, private individual conduct beyond the\n\npower of the criminal law-making authority to proscribe,\" id. at\n\n311) (quoting Mackey v. United States, 401 U.S. 667, 675 (1971)\n\n(Harlan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)).                    In\n\narguing the     habeas   court's   error,   the   government     asks   us   to\n\nconclude that the trial court found that the seized images depicted\n\nactual children and that we should, therefore, reinstate the\n\nconviction.\n\n           For the government to prevail in this appeal and persuade\n\nus to reinstate the conviction, we must agree that sufficient\n\nevidence was presented at Hilton's trial to satisfy the element of\n\nthe crime that the children depicted in the images are real.\n\nEvidence is deficient, as a matter of law, when \"after assaying all\n\nthe evidence in the light most amiable to the government, and\n\ntaking    all   reasonable   inferences     in    its   favor,   a   rational\n\nfactfinder could [not] find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the\n\nprosecution successfully proved the essential elements of the\n\ncrime.\"    United States v. O'Brien, 14 F.3d 703, 706 (1st Cir.\n\n1994).    We agree with the district court and conclude that the\n\ngovernment presented insufficient evidence at Hilton's trial to\n\nsustain a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(5)(B).\n\n           Congress amended the CPPA in 1996 as a response to\n\ntechnological developments that enabled the manufacture of images\n\nthat look like child pornography and yet are produced without\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fchildren.      See Pub. L. No. 104-208, div. A, tit. I, § 121(1)(5),\n\n110   Stat.     3009-26    (1996).       Because     the    Supreme    Court   has\n\nestablished      that     the   First    Amendment    does    not     countenance\n\nprohibitions on such speech, we hold that conviction under § 2252A\n\n(a)(5)(B) requires the government to present evidence proving that\n\nthe child in the image is not confabulated, but real.\n\n              The government is not released from this burden of proof\n\nby a failure on the defendant's part to argue, or by an absence of\n\nevidence otherwise suggesting, the artificiality of the children\n\nportrayed.     That the children in the images are real amounts to an\n\nelement   of    the   crime     which   the    government    must   prove.     The\n\nartificiality of the children depicted is not to be rendered a mere\n\naffirmative      defense.5        \"Protected      speech     does     not    become\n\nunprotected merely because it resembles the latter.\"                  Free Speech\n\nCoalition, 535 U.S. at 255.\n\n              The government argues, and other circuits have agreed,\n\nthat the pornographic images themselves should suffice to prove the\n\nuse of actual children in production. See United States v. Kimler,\n\n\n\n5\n   The CPPA, as it existed at Hilton's conviction, provided an\naffirmative defense for persons charged with non-possession\noffenses, i.e., distribution, production, and sale, by showing only\nadults were used in the production of the material.      18 U.S.C.\n§ 2252A(c) (1996).    The Supreme Court in Free Speech Coalition\nrecognized that \"[t]he Government raises serious constitutional\ndifficulties by seeking to impose on the defendant the burden of\nproving his speech is not unlawful\" but did \"not decide, however,\nwhether the Government could impose this burden on a speaker.\"\nFree Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. at 256.\n\n                                        -13-\n\f335 F.3d 1132, 1142 (10th Cir. 2003) (\"Juries are still capable of\n\ndistinguishing between real and virtual images . . . .\"); United\n\nStates v. Deaton, 328 F.3d 454, 455 (8th Cir. 2003) (reaffirming\n\nthe reasonableness of \"a jury's conclusion that real children were\n\ndepicted even where the images themselves were the only evidence\n\nthe government presented on the subject\"); United States v. Hall,\n\n312 F.3d 1250, 1260 (11th Cir. 2002) (affirming pre-Free Speech\n\nCoalition conviction because \"no reasonable jury could have found\n\nthat   the    images   were   virtual    children   created   by   computer\n\ntechnology as opposed to actual children\"). These courts' holdings\n\nexpress a judgment that a jury can distinguish a depiction of an\n\nactual child from a depiction of a virtual child \"even where the\n\nimages themselves were the only evidence.\"           Deaton, 328 F.3d at\n\n455.   While the images form essential evidence without which a\n\nconviction could not be sustained, we hold that the government must\n\nintroduce relevant evidence in addition to the images to prove the\n\nchildren are real.\n\n             In United States v. Nolan, 818 F.2d 1015 (1st Cir. 1987),\n\nthis court reviewed a conviction under the CPPA before Congress\n\namended the definition of child pornography to include images that\n\n\"appear[] to be\" of children.           See Pub. L. No. 104-208, div. A,\n\ntit. I, § 121(2)(4), 110 Stat. 3009-26 (1996).           Nolan argued on\n\nappeal that since the government had relied on the images to prove\n\nthe crime, it had presented insufficient evidence.            We held that\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\f\"on this record the prosecution was not required, as part of its\n\naffirmative case, to rule out every conceivable way the pictures\n\ncould have been made other than by ordinary photography.\"                     Id. at\n\n1020. Rather, we noted that Nolan \"presented no expert evidence at\n\ntrial that these pictures were or could have been produced by any\n\nsuch artificial means.\"         Id. at 1019.     Today we recognize that the\n\nvast technological revolution underway since 1987 -- when we\n\ndecided Nolan --         has   made   undeniable       the    fact   that   sexually\n\nexplicit images portraying children can be produced by artificial\n\nmeans; the burden of proving that the images \"were or could have\n\nbeen produced by any such artificial means\" can no longer rest on\n\nthe defendant.       To convict under § 2252A(a)(5)(B), the government\n\nmust supplement the images with other relevant evidence proving\n\nthat the children portrayed are real. The defendant is entitled to\n\nhave   this    element    proved      affirmatively      without     entering    any\n\nevidence to the contrary.          Otherwise, \"[p]rotected speech [could]\n\nbecome   unprotected      merely      because    it    resembles      [unprotected\n\nspeech].\"      Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. at 255.\n\n              The   government     contends     that    Dr.    Ricci's      testimony\n\nconstituted relevant evidence establishing that the children in\n\nHilton's computer images were real.               Dr. Ricci's testimony and\n\nimage-by-image evaluations supported the district court's finding\n\nthat the images represented children rather than adults.                         The\n\ngovernment argues that in proving that the images represented\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\fchildren, Dr. Ricci also made the case that the children were real.\n\nIn the government's own words:\n\n          The \"Tanner Scale\" was developed through an\n          analysis of \"large numbers of children\" both\n          in the United States and throughout the world.\n          Commonsense establishes that the scale was\n          developed through the assessment of actual\n          children.    The reasonable and commonsense\n          inference is also that Dr. Ricci, as an expert\n          pediatrician, would apply the \"Tanner Scale\"\n          only to actual children.\n\nWe find more commonsensical a proposition leading to the contrary\n\ninference that someone manufacturing images to look like children\n\nwill try -- and with sufficient technology will manage -- to\n\nproduce images that would be amenable to expert analysis under the\n\nTanner Scale.   Whatever parameters of body proportion, growth and\n\ndevelopment serve as signs of age under the Tanner Scale, those\n\nparameters will be mimicked by the virtual pornographer -- whether\n\nby design or as a byproduct of the goal of realism.   What a finding\n\nof guilt beyond a reasonable doubt demands is evidence that the\n\nindicators of youth apparent to the untrained eye belong to an\n\nactual child.   Accordingly, we find the government's contention\n\n\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\fthat Dr. Ricci presented sufficient evidence to prove that the\n\nchildren represented were real unavailing.6\n\n           In response to Free Speech Coalition, Congress rewrote\n\nthe invalidated sections of the CPPA.         In place of the \"appears to\n\nbe\" language    formerly     at   §   2256(8)(B),   Congress   added   a   new\n\ndefinition of child pornography: \"such visual depiction is a\n\ndigital image, computer image, or computer-generated image that is,\n\nor is indistinguishable from, that of a minor engaging in sexually\n\nexplicit conduct.\"      18 U.S.C. § 2256(8)(B) (2003).          Our holding\n\ntoday applies equally to the new § 2256(8)(B) because \"appears to\n\nbe\"   is   equivalent   to    \"indistinguishable\"      in   this   context.7\n\nPossession of non-obscene images can only be punished when real\n\n\n\n\n6\n   This appeal does not require us to delineate what kinds of\nevidence can prove that the children depicted are real, as the\ngovernment proffered no evidence relevant to this element apart\nfrom the images. We note, however, that evidence establishing the\nidentity of a depicted child could demonstrate to a factfinder that\nreal children were used to produce images. Other evidence, such as\nthe testimony of a computer graphics expert, could also permit the\nfactfinder to reasonably determine that this element of the crime\nwas proved beyond a reasonable doubt. See, e.g., United States v.\nRearden, 349 F.3d 608, 613-14 (9th Cir. 2003).\n7\n   There is some irony to this change, as the Senate's discussion\nof the 1996 \"appears to be\" amendment shows that Congress aimed\nwith that language to target images \"which are virtually\nindistinguishable to unsuspecting viewers from unretouched\nphotographs of actual children engaging in identical sexual\nconduct.\" S. Rep. 104-358, at pt. I, IV(B) (emphasis added); see\nHilton II, 167 F.3d at 72.\n\n                                      -17-\n\fchildren were part of the production process,8 and that is for the\n\ngovernment to prove.9\n\n                              III.    Conclusion\n\n          The     district    court      properly    granted       Hilton    post-\n\nconviction    relief     because   the   United     States   did    not     present\n\nsufficient evidence to prove that the images in evidence against\n\nHilton represented actual children.           The government must present\n\nrelevant evidence in addition to the images themselves, and Dr.\n\nRicci's testimony as to the ages of the children depicted in the\n\nimages was not adequate to meet this burden.\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n8\n   Participation in the production process might involve as little\nas having one's face photographed and then morphed into a sexually\nexplicit image using an adult or virtual model to complete the\npicture. The Supreme Court, addressing the CPPA's ban on morphed\nimages, refrained from addressing its constitutionality:\n\n     Section 2256(8)(C) prohibits a more common and lower tech\n     means of creating virtual images, known as computer\n     morphing.     Rather than creating original images,\n     pornographers can alter innocent pictures of real\n     children so that the children appear to be engaged in\n     sexual activity. Although morphed images may fall within\n     the definition of virtual child pornography, they\n     implicate the interests of real children and are in that\n     sense closer to the images in Ferber. Respondents do not\n     challenge this provision, and we do not consider it.\n\nFree Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. at 242.\n9\n   As part of PROTECT, Congress also extended the affirmative\ndefense for a defendant, prosecuted for the possession offense of\nwhich Hilton was indicted, who can show that adults rather than\nchildren were used or that no actual children were used in creating\nthe image. 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(c) (2003).\n\n                                      -18-\n\fConcurring opinion follows.\n\n\n\n\n           -19-\n\f             HOWARD, Circuit Judge (Concurring in the judgment).           I\n\nagree that the judgment should be vacated, but I would not hold\n\nthat the government must present evidence in addition to the image\n\nitself to prove that the picture depicts an actual child and not a\n\nvirtual image.10\n\n                                      I.\n\n             The law in this circuit has been that a trier of fact,\n\nwithout the assistance of an expert or other evidence, can discern\n\nbetween an actual and virtual image of child pornography.                See\n\nUnited States v. Nolan, 818 F.2d 1015, 1017-19 (1st Cir. 1987).           In\n\nNolan,   a   pre-1996    Child   Pornography    Prevention    Act   (\"CPPA\")\n\nprosecution, the defendant challenged his conviction on the grounds\n\nthat the government had failed to prove that the pornographic\n\npictures at issue depicted actual children.            Id. at 1017.     The\n\ndefendant argued that the pictures were insufficient evidence on\n\nthis   issue   because    the    government   failed   to   present   expert\n\ntestimony that the pictures were not generated through computer\n\nimaging or similar methods.           Id.     We rejected this argument,\n\nconcluding that \"ordinary people in today's society are quite\n\n\n\n\n10\n     The issue here concerns only the evidence necessary to\ndistinguish between actual and virtual images of child pornography.\nEvidentiary issues concerning \"morphed images\" of child pornography\n(e.g., images that combine a child and adult body to make one\nimage) are not implicated because possession of such images remains\nillegal under the CPPA. See Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, 535\nU.S. 234, 242 at n.8 (2002).\n\n                                     -20-\n\faccustomed to seeing photographs and distinguishing them from other\n\nforms of visual representations.\"                Id.\n\n              As I read today's decision, we overrule Nolan because\n\n\"the   vast    technological        revolution     underway        since   [Nolan   was\n\ndecided] has made undeniable the fact that sexually explicit images\n\nportraying children can be produced through artificial means.\"\n\nAnte at 15.          There can be no doubt that we have undergone a\n\ntechnological revolution since Nolan.                   One need only turn on a\n\ncomputer, attend a movie, or view one of the latest video games to\n\nunderstand that we live in a digital age in which virtual images\n\nlook   more    and    more   real.        One    certainly    can    understand     the\n\nmajority's concern that this same technology could be used to\n\nproduce realistic virtual pornography.\n\n              However, I think the question we resolve here should not\n\nbe whether technology has improved greatly since Nolan.                             The\n\nrelevant question in this case, involving images created almost a\n\ndecade or longer ago, should be whether the available technology\n\nhad    progressed      to    such    an   extent       that   we    can    never    (and\n\nspecifically in this case) trust lay people, unaided by experts or\n\nother evidence, to differentiate between the real and the virtual.\n\nI would adhere to Nolan and to what appear to be all of the other\n\nrelevant authorities to conclude that ordinarily fact finders can\n\n\n\n\n                                          -21-\n\fcontinue to distinguish between real and virtual images of child\n\npornography based solely on the presentation of the images.11\n\n           It is true that in passing the 1996 amendment to the\n\nCPPA, Congress appears to have taken the view that there are\n\ninstances in which lay people are no longer able to distinguish\n\nbetween the real and the virtual.            As the Senate report put it:\n\n           New and increasingly less complex technology\n           and expensive photographic computer imaging\n           technologies make it possible for individuals\n           to produce on home computers visual depictions\n           of children engaging in sexually explicit\n           conduct that are virtually indistinguishable\n           from retouched photographic images of actual\n           children   engaging   in   sexually   explicit\n           conduct.\n\nS. Rep. 104-358 (emphasis supplied).\n\n           The Supreme Court, however, does not agree.                     In Free\n\nSpeech   Coalition,   the   government        claimed     that,   under    current\n\ntechnology,     \"virtual    images      [can       be     created    that       are]\n\nindistinguishable from real ones.\" 535 U.S. at 1404-05. The Court\n\nfound this \"hypothesis [to be] somewhat implausible.\" It reasoned,\n\n\"[I]f virtual images were identical to illegal child pornography,\n\nthe   illegal   images   would   be    driven      from    the    market   by    the\n\nindistinguishable     substitutes.           Few   pornographers     would      risk\n\n\n\n11\n    This is not to say the majority's concerns are off base.\nIndeed, as a matter of the reliability of evidence, it is not clear\nwhere the logical stopping point for the majority's concerns is,\nand the time may come when the rule it today establishes for this\ncircuit will become prevalent. For now, I would leave the issue to\nsound trial management by the district courts.\n\n                                      -22-\n\fprosecution by abusing real children if fictional, computerized\n\nimages would suffice.\"       Id. at 254.12   The import of this statement\n\nis that the typical consumer of child pornography can differentiate\n\nbetween     real   and    virtual   depictions    of   child    pornography.\n\nPresumably, if the average child pornography consumer can make such\n\na determination, so can a judge or juror.\n\n             In the wake of Free Speech Coalition,            every court to\n\nhave considered the question has determined that the presentation\n\nof   the    pictures     alone   constitutes     sufficient    evidence   for\n\ndetermining that an actual child is depicted in the pornographic\n\nimage.     See United States v. Slanina, 359 F.3d 356, 357 (5th Cir.\n\n2004) (per curiam) (\"[T]he Government was not required to present\n\nany additional evidence or expert testimony to meet its burden of\n\nproof to show that the image downloaded by [the defendant] depicted\n\nreal children and not virtual children.\"); United States v. Kimler,\n\n335 F.3d 1132, 1142 (10th Cir. 2003) (\"Juries are still capable of\n\ndistinguishing between real and virtual images.\"); United States v.\n\n\n12\n   The dissenting Justices accepted the government's argument that\nvirtual images could be created that are indistinguishable from\nreal ones. See Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. at 264 (O'Connor,\nJ., dissenting); 535 U.S. at 268-69 (Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting).\nIn addition to the majority opinion, Justice Thomas, stated that\nwhile technology may advance to the point that indistinguishable\nvirtual images could be created, the government failed to\ndemonstrate that this advancement had already occurred. Id. at\n259-60 (Thomas, J., concurring in the judgment). Thus, the various\nFree Speech Coalition opinions indicate that the issue of whether\ntruly indistinguishable virtual images of child pornography can be\ncreated using modern technology was considered by all the Justices\nand rejected by a majority.\n\n                                    -23-\n\fDeaton,    328   F.3d   454,   455    (8th     Cir.    2003)   (upholding    jury's\n\nconclusion that pictures depicted actual children \"where the images\n\nthemselves were the only evidence the government presented on the\n\nsubject\"); United States v.

In my view,\n\nthere is nothing about this case that provides a substantial reason\n\nto decline to follow the Supreme Court's guidance on this issue and\n\nto reject the holdings of our companion courts that evidence in\n\naddition to the image itself is not required to prove that the\n\npornographic picture depicts an actual child.\n\n             The   majority   opinion   suggests   that   testimony   by   a\n\ncomputer graphics expert or evidence identifying the depicted child\n\ncould satisfy the additional burden that the government must now\n\nmeet to prove that the picture at issue shows a real child.           Ante\n\nat 17 n.6.    After Free Speech Coalition, defendants will certainly\n\nargue that the government has failed to prove beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt that the pictures are of real children.             And, in light of\n\nevolving technology, triers of fact may be more inclined to accept\n\nsuch arguments if the government relies on only the pictures as\n\nevidence.     Nevertheless, it is one thing to acknowledge that the\n\ngovernment could benefit from introducing additional evidence and\n\nquite another to insist that the government introduce such evidence\n\nin every case regardless of the circumstances. I would not require\n\nthat, as a general rule, the government       must introduce additional\n\nevidence to meet its burden of proving that the pictures at issue\n\ndepict actual children.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -25-\n\f                                 II.\n\n          Although I believe that there was sufficient evidence to\n\nsustain Hilton's conviction based on the government's presentation\n\nof the images in his possession, I nevertheless agree that Hilton's\n\nconviction must be vacated.\n\n           Because Hilton's trial occurred before Free Speech\n\nCoalition, the government was not required to prove that the\n\npictures at issue depicted actual children to gain a conviction.\n\nAs a result, the trier of fact did not find that the pictures in\n\nHilton's possession depicted actual children as is required for a\n\nvalid conviction.    See ante at 11 (stating that parties agree that\n\nFree   Speech   Coalition    applies   retroactively   to   Hilton's\n\nconviction).    The failure of the trier of fact to find every\n\nelement of a crime (even though sufficient evidence on the element\n\nwas presented at trial) is a constitutional error that sometimes\n\nrequires reversal.    See United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 511\n\n(1995).\n\n          However, the failure of the fact finder to find every\n\nelement of a crime does not mandate reversal in all cases.   Errors\n\nof this sort are susceptible to harmless error review. Mitchell v.\n\nEsparaza, 124 S. Ct. 7, 11 (2003) (per curiam); Neder v. United\n\nStates, 527 U.S. 1, 19 (1999); United States v. Raheman-Fazal, 355\n\nF.3d 40, 47 (1st Cir. 2004).    Indeed, some courts have upheld pre\n\nFree Speech Coalition CPPA convictions, despite the fact finder's\n\n\n                                -26-\n\ffailure to find that the pictures depicted actual children.               See\n\nUnited States v. Wolk, 337 F.3d 997, 1004-05 (8th Cir. 2003)\n\n(upholding CPPA conviction, under plain error review, because\n\nstrong   evidence     demonstrated    that     pictures   depicted    actual\n\nchildren; accordingly, lack of jury finding on \"actual child\n\nelement\" did not affect defendant's substantial rights); Hall, 312\n\nF.3d at 1260 (similar).13\n\n           Had the government asserted that the error here was\n\nharmless, I would have seriously considered its argument.             But the\n\ngovernment, the appellant in this case, has chosen not to do so.\n\nThe   argument   is   therefore   forfeit.      See   Plumley   v.   Southern\n\nContainer, Inc., 303 F.3d 364, 372 n.7 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n           Furthermore, the state of the record does not permit us\n\nto find harmless error sua sponte.          See United States v. Rose, 104\n\nF.3d 1408, 1414-15 (1st Cir. 1997) (stating that in some cases\n\ncourt may raise harmless error sua sponte).           The trial transcript\n\nis not part of the appellate record, which makes conducting a\n\n\n\n\n13\n    These cases were decided under the \"affecting substantial\nrights\" prong of the plain error analysis under Fed. R. Crim. P.\n52(b). Such analysis is essentially the same as a harmless error\nreview except that the defendant, not the government, bears the\nburden of proof under Rule 52(b).      See United States v. Soto-\nBeníquez, 356 F.3d 1, 49 (1st Cir. 2004); United States v. Ramírez-\nBurgos, 313 F.3d 23, 29 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n                                     -27-\n\fharmless error review all the more difficult.14   See id. at 1415.\n\nWhile the record before us includes the pictures in Hilton's\n\npossession, I cannot tell what other evidence, if any, would\n\nsupport a harmless error conclusion. Indeed, I cannot even discern\n\nhow the pictures were introduced at trial or what evidence was\n\ngiven to the trier of fact about them by either party.     While the\n\npictures alone can constitute evidence sufficient to sustain a CPPA\n\nconviction, I am not prepared to say, on this incomplete record and\n\nwithout argument from the parties, that they are enough to conclude\n\nthat the fact finder's failure to find that the images in Hilton's\n\npossession were of actual children was a harmless error.\n\n\n\n\n14\n   Although the government's brief cites to the trial transcript,\nthe docket indicates that the only transcripts filed in this court\nwere of a bail hearing held on June 5, 2003 and a motion hearing\nheld on June 9, 2003.\n\n                               -28-\n\f",

Section 2252A(a)(5)(B) criminalizes the knowing possession of child pornography that has traveled between states or between countries. Hilton's First Amendment challenge involved the definition of \"child pornography\" in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2256(8). That provision defines child pornography to include \"any visual depiction, including any photograph, film, video, picture, or computer or computer-generated image or picture, whether made or produced by electronic, mechanical, or other means, of sexually explicit conduct, where such visual depiction is, or appears to be, of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2256(8)(B). Section 2256(8)(B) was added by Congress in 1996 after finding that \"new photographic and computer imaging technologies make it possible to produce by electronic, mechanical, or other means, visual depictions of what <i>appear to be</i> children engaging in sexually explicit conduct that are virtually indistinguishable to the unsuspecting viewer from unretouched photographic images of actual children engaging in sexually explicit conduct.\" Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-208, div. A, tit. I, &#167; 121(1)(5), 110 Stat. 3009-26 (1996) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hilton argued that this new definition violated the First Amendment by prohibiting some adult pornography &#8212; that appearing to be of children &#8212; and by virtue of vagueness and overbreadth. The district court agreed, holding that the CPPA's \"appears to be\" provision was overbroad and left unclear exactly what images were illegal. The district court dismissed the indictment on March 26, 1998. <i>United States v. Hilton,</i> 999 F.Supp. 131 (D.Me. 1998) (\"<i>Hilton I</i>\"). The United States appealed, and this court reversed and reinstated the indictment. <i>See United States v. Hilton,</i> 167 F.3d 61 (1st Cir.1999) (\"<i>Hilton II</i>\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Trial and Appeal</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the Supreme Court denied Hilton's petition for certiorari, the case advanced to trial. Hilton waived his right to a jury trial. After the issuance of a superseding indictment on January 5, 2000, the district court heard the case against Hilton over the course of three days. This court reviewed the district court's findings extensively in <i>United States v. Hilton,</i> 257 F.3d 50 (1st Cir.2001) (\"<i>Hilton IV</i>\") (reviewing <i>United States v. Hilton,</i> No. 97-78-P-C, 2000 WL 894679, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9220 (D. Me. June 30, 2000) (\"<i>Hilton III</i>\")). Here we concentrate on the evidence at issue in this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The search of Hilton's computer room on November 7, 1997, produced a number of pornographic images. These were found on a Sony Backup Tape, in Hilton's hard drive, and printed up and stored in a \"gray box.\" According to Agent Marx of the local police, whom the parties stipulated as a computer forensics expert, the Sony Backup Tape was used to back up Hilton's computer two months before seizure. The Sony tape contained thousands of images; the government introduced seven of them. The \"gray box\" contained a print-out with four images identical to four in the Sony tape. The hard drive contained three images, and this court on review found two to be non-explicit. <i>See Hilton IV,</i> 257 F.3d at 58.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prove that these images depicted children, rather than adults, the government introduced the testimony of Dr. Lawrence Ricci. Dr. Ricci testified as to the Tanner Scale and its application to the seized images. The Tanner Scale was developed through analysis of many children both in the United States and throughout the world and provides a basis for estimating a person's stage of physiological development. Dr. Ricci marked on the backs of the images his opinion as to the children's ages. In his opinion, apart from an image that morphed a child's face with an adult woman's body, the other nine images represented children at various stages of development, ranging from pre-school to young teen. <i>See Hilton III,</i> 2000 WL 894679 at *7, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9220 at *23-26.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on this evidence, the district court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the images satisfied the definition of child pornography in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2256(8). The court also found the required element of scienter and an interstate nexus. Since the court did not find merit in Hilton's affirmative defenses that he was possessing the images under authority of the government, it convicted Hilton on June 30, 2000, and subsequently sentenced him to forty months imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hilton appealed his conviction, challenging the constitutionality of the CPPA and the sufficiency of the evidence. He reiterated his affirmative defense that he had collected the images at the government's request. <i>Hilton IV,</i> 257 F.3d 50. Hilton also claimed that the district court erred in his sentencing. We rejected all but the sentencing claim. Since we concluded that two of the three hard drive images did not qualify as child pornography or involve the sexual exploitation of a minor, we remanded for resentencing because the record did not support the Sentencing Guidelines upward adjustment applied by the district court for possession of \"ten or more ... items, containing a visual depiction involving the sexual exploitation of a minor.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 2G2.4(b)(2); <i>see Hilton IV,</i> 257 F.3d at 58. As for Hilton's constitutional challenge, we noted that we had \"rejected this claim on Hilton's earlier appeal.\" <i>Hilton IV,</i> 257 F.3d at 53. Hilton asked us to reconsider our prior holding in light of the Ninth Circuit's decision in <i>Free Speech Coalition v. Reno,</i> 198 F.3d 1083 (9th Cir. 1999), but we declined to do so.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>Id.</i> Thus, on July 27, 2001, we affirmed Hilton's conviction and remanded for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the district court sentenced Hilton to thirty-four months of incarceration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>The CPPA after Ashcroft v.

Reno,</i> 198 F.3d 1083 (9th Cir. 1999), a civil suit challenging on its face the constitutionality of the CPPA as amended in 1996. The key challenge, and the one relevant here, was against prosecution for \"child pornography\" that only \"appears to be, of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2256(8)(B). In <i>Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition,</i> 535 U.S. 234, 122 S.Ct. 1389, 152 L.Ed.2d 403 (2002), the Court affirmed the Ninth Circuit holding that such prosecutions violate the First Amendment's protection against governmental abridgement of the freedom of speech. <i>Id.</i> at 258, 122 S.Ct. 1389; <i>see</i> U.S. Const. amend.

Ferber,</i> 458 U.S. 747, 761-62, 102 S.Ct. 3348, 73 L.Ed.2d 1113 (1982) (quoting <i>Giboney v. Empire Storage &amp; Ice Co.,</i> 336 U.S. 490, 498, 69 S.Ct. 684, 93 L.Ed. 834 (1949))).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The CPPA is not circumscribed by the <i>Miller</i> definition of obscenity. <i>Free Speech Coalition,</i> 535 U.S. at 246, 122 S.Ct. 1389.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Therefore, since the \"appears to be\" definition prohibits non-obscene speech, the <i>Free Speech Coalition</i> Court addressed the government's contention that the rationale behind <i>Osborne</i> and <i>Ferber</i> extended to the criminalization of sexually explicit images that appear to contain children. Those two cases viewed the trade in and possession of child pornography as bearing a proximate link to the child abuse that produced the images in the first place. <i>See Free Speech Coalition,</i> 535 U.S. at 249-50, 122 S.Ct. 1389. The government presented two types of arguments to show that the prohibition on virtual pornography was indeed proximate to compelling interests; one argument was based on the injuries allegedly flowing from \"appears to be\" child pornography and the second on prosecutorial necessity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two concerns motivated the first argument: (1) that \"pedophiles may use virtual child pornography to seduce children,\" <i>id.</i> at 251, 122 S.Ct. 1389, and (2) that virtual child pornography \"whets the appetites of pedophiles and encourages them to engage in illegal conduct.\" <i>Id.</i> at 253, 122 S.Ct. 1389. Contrary to our earlier conclusion in <i>Hilton II,</i> 167 F.3d at 72-74, the Court held that the availability of virtual child pornography to child abusers does not provide a basis for the prohibition because while \"[t]he objective is to prohibit illegal conduct ... this restriction goes well beyond that interest by restricting the speech available to law-abiding adults.\" <i>Id.</i> at 252-53, 122 S.Ct. 1389. As for the concern that virtual child pornography motivates child abuse, the Court disagreed with the premise behind the government's argument: \"[t]he mere tendency of speech to encourage unlawful acts is not a sufficient reason for banning it.\" <i>Free Speech Coalition,</i> 535 U.S. at 253, 122 S.Ct. 1389. Because \"[t]he Government has shown no more than a remote connection between speech that might encourage thoughts or impulses and any resulting child abuse,\" it \"may not prohibit speech on the ground that it may encourage pedophiles to engage in illegal conduct.\" <i>Id.</i> at 253-54, 122 S.Ct. 1389.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's second argument was that eliminating actual child pornography necessitates the prohibition on virtual pornography because virtual images are indistinguishable from real ones. <i>Id.</i> at 254-55, 122 S.Ct. 1389. First, the government contended that \"[v]irtual images ... are indistinguishable from real ones[, and] they are part of the same market and are often exchanged.\" <i>Id.</i> at 254, 122 S.Ct. 1389. The Court found this \"hypothesis... somewhat implausible. If virtual images were identical to illegal child pornography, the illegal images would be driven from the market by the indistinguishable substitutes. Few pornographers would risk prosecution by abusing real children if fictional, computerized images would suffice.\" <i>Id.</i> To the government's claim that indistinguishability meant that the successful prosecution of actual child pornography necessitated criminalization of virtual child pornography, the Court responded: \"[t]he argument, in essence, is that protected speech may be banned as a means to ban unprotected speech. This analysis turns the First Amendment upside down.\" <i>Id.</i> at 255, 122 S.Ct. 1389. Thus the Court held that possession of material that satisfied only &#167; 2256(8)(B) could not be punished.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>Id.</i> at 256, 122 S.Ct. 1389.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. <i>Post-Conviction Relief</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the Court's ruling in <i>Free Speech Coalition,</i> Hilton filed a motion for post-conviction relief under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 on November 13, 2002.

Both parties agree that the holding of <i>Free Speech Coalition</i> applies retroactively. <i>See Teague v. Lane,</i> 489 U.S. 288, 307-11, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989) (exception to non-retroactivity when new rule \"places certain kinds of primary, private individual conduct beyond the power of the criminal law-making authority to proscribe,\" <i>id.</i> at 311, 109 S.Ct. 1060) (quoting <i>Mackey v.

In arguing the habeas court's error, the government asks us to conclude that the trial court found that the seized images depicted actual children and that we should, therefore, reinstate the conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the government to prevail in this appeal and persuade us to reinstate the conviction, we must agree that sufficient evidence was presented at Hilton's trial to satisfy the element of the crime that the children depicted in the images are real. Evidence is deficient, as a matter of law, when \"after assaying all the evidence in the light most amiable to the government, and taking all reasonable inferences in its favor, a rational factfinder could [not] find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the prosecution successfully proved the essential elements of the crime.\" <i>United States v. O'Brien,</i> 14 F.3d 703, 706 (1st Cir.1994). We agree with the district court and conclude that the government presented insufficient evidence at Hilton's trial to sustain a conviction under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2252A(a)(5)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress amended the CPPA in 1996 as a response to technological developments that enabled the manufacture of images that look like child pornography and yet are produced without children. <i>See</i> Pub.L. No. 104-208, div. A, tit. I, &#167; 121(1)(5), 110 Stat. 3009-26 (1996). Because the Supreme Court has established that the First Amendment does not countenance prohibitions on such speech, we hold that conviction under &#167; 2252A (a)(5)(B) requires the government to present evidence proving that the child in the image is not confabulated, but real.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government is not released from this burden of proof by a failure on the defendant's part to argue, or by an absence of evidence otherwise suggesting, the artificiality of the children portrayed. That the children in the images are real amounts to an element of the crime which the government must prove. The artificiality of the children depicted is not to be rendered a mere affirmative defense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> \"Protected speech does not become unprotected merely because it resembles the latter.\" <i>Free Speech Coalition,</i> 535 U.S. at 255, 122 S.Ct. 1389.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues, and other circuits have agreed, that the pornographic images themselves should suffice to prove the use of actual children in production. <i>See United States v.

These courts' holdings express a judgment that a jury can distinguish a depiction of an actual child from a depiction of a virtual child \"even where the images themselves were the only evidence.\" <i>Deaton,</i> 328 F.3d at 455. While the images form essential evidence without which a conviction could not be sustained, we hold that the government must introduce relevant evidence <i>in addition to</i> the images to prove the children are real.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>United States v.

No. 104-208, div. A, tit. I, &#167; 121(2)(4), 110 Stat. 3009-26 (1996). Nolan argued on appeal that since the government had relied on the images to prove the crime, it had presented insufficient evidence. We held that \"on this record the prosecution was not required, as part of its affirmative case, to rule out every conceivable way the pictures could have been made other than by ordinary photography.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1020. Rather, we noted that Nolan \"presented no expert evidence at trial that these pictures were or could have been produced by any such artificial means.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1019. Today we recognize that the vast technological revolution underway since 1987 &#8212; when we decided <i>Nolan</i> &#8212; has made undeniable the fact that sexually explicit images portraying children can be produced by artificial means; the burden of proving that the images \"were or could have been produced by any such artificial means\" can no longer rest on the defendant. To convict under &#167; 2252A(a)(5)(B), the government must supplement the images with other relevant evidence proving that the children portrayed are real. The defendant is entitled to have this element proved affirmatively without entering any evidence to the contrary. Otherwise, \"[p]rotected speech [could] become unprotected merely because it resembles [unprotected speech].\" <i>Free Speech Coalition,</i> 535 U.S. at 255, 122 S.Ct. 1389.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government contends that Dr. Ricci's testimony constituted relevant evidence establishing that the children in Hilton's computer images were real. Dr. Ricci's testimony and image-by-image evaluations supported the district court's finding that the images represented children rather than adults.

Whatever parameters of body proportion, growth and development serve as signs of age under the Tanner Scale, those parameters will be mimicked by the virtual pornographer &#8212; whether by design or as a byproduct of the goal of realism. What a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt demands is evidence that the indicators of youth apparent to the untrained eye belong to an actual child. Accordingly, we find the government's contention that Dr. Ricci presented sufficient evidence to prove that the children represented were real unavailing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to <i>Free Speech Coalition,</i> Congress rewrote the invalidated sections of the CPPA.

The defendant argued that the pictures were insufficient evidence on this issue because the government failed to present expert testimony that the pictures were not generated through computer imaging or similar methods. <i>Id.</i> We rejected this argument, concluding that \"ordinary people in today's society are quite accustomed to seeing photographs and distinguishing them from other forms of visual representations.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As I read today's decision, we overrule <i>Nolan</i> because \"the vast technological revolution underway since [<i>Nolan</i> was decided] has made undeniable the fact that sexually explicit images portraying children can be produced through artificial means.\" <i>Ante</i> at 65. There can be no doubt that we have undergone a technological revolution since <i>Nolan.</i> One need only turn on a computer, attend a movie, or view one of the latest video games to understand that we live in a digital age in which virtual images look more and more real.

I would adhere to <i>Nolan</i> and to what appear to be all of the other relevant authorities to conclude that ordinarily fact finders can continue to distinguish between real and virtual images of child pornography based solely on the presentation of the images.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that in passing the 1996 amendment to the CPPA, Congress appears to have taken the view that there are instances in which lay people are no longer able to distinguish between the real and the virtual.

The Court found this \"hypothesis [to be] somewhat implausible.\" It reasoned, \"[I]f virtual images were identical to illegal child pornography, the illegal images would be driven from the market by the indistinguishable substitutes.

Oct.10, 2003) (holding that under Virginia child pornography statute \"the Commonwealth may seek to rely upon the images themselves without the necessity for expert opinion\" to prove that pictures depict images of actual children). In my view, there is nothing about this case that provides a substantial reason to decline to follow the Supreme Court's guidance on this issue and to reject the holdings of our companion courts that evidence in addition to the image itself is not required to prove that the pornographic picture depicts an actual child.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority opinion suggests that testimony by a computer graphics expert or evidence identifying the depicted child could satisfy the additional burden that the government must now meet to prove that the picture at issue shows a real child. <i>Ante</i> at 65 n. 6. After <i>Free Speech Coalition,</i> defendants will certainly argue that the government has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the pictures are of real children. And, in light of evolving technology, triers of fact may be more inclined to accept such arguments if the government relies on only the pictures as evidence. Nevertheless, it is one thing to acknowledge that the government could benefit from introducing additional evidence and quite another to insist that the government introduce such evidence in every case regardless of the circumstances. I would not require that, as a general rule, the government must introduce additional evidence to meet its burden of proving that the pictures at issue depict actual children.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although I believe that there was sufficient evidence to sustain Hilton's conviction based on the government's presentation of the images in his possession, I nevertheless agree that Hilton's conviction must be vacated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Hilton's trial occurred before <i>Free Speech Coalition,</i> the government was not required to prove that the pictures at issue depicted actual children to gain a conviction. As a result, the trier of fact did not find that the pictures in Hilton's possession depicted actual children as is required for a valid conviction. <i>See ante</i> at 63 (stating that parties agree that <i>Free Speech Coalition</i> applies retroactively to Hilton's conviction). The failure of the trier of fact to find every element of a crime (even though sufficient evidence on the element was presented at trial) is a constitutional error that sometimes requires reversal. <i>See United States v.

Indeed, some courts have upheld pre <i>Free Speech Coalition</i> CPPA convictions, despite the fact finder's failure to find that the pictures depicted actual children. <i>See United States v. Wolk,</i> 337 F.3d 997, 1004-05 (8th Cir.2003) (upholding CPPA conviction, under plain error review, because strong evidence demonstrated that pictures depicted actual children; accordingly, lack of jury finding on \"actual child element\" did not affect defendant's substantial rights); <i>Hall,</i> 312 F.3d at 1260 (similar).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Had the government asserted that the error here was harmless, I would have seriously considered its argument. But the government, the appellant in this case, has chosen not to do so. The argument is therefore forfeit. <i>See Plumley v.

While the record before us includes the pictures in Hilton's possession, I cannot tell what other evidence, if any, would support a harmless error conclusion. Indeed, I cannot even discern how the pictures were introduced at trial or what evidence was given to the trier of fact about them by either party. While the pictures alone can constitute evidence sufficient to sustain a CPPA conviction, I am not prepared to say, on this incomplete record and without argument from the parties, that they are enough to conclude that the fact finder's failure to find that the images in Hilton's possession were of actual children was a harmless error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> The issue here concerns only the evidence necessary to distinguish between actual and virtual images of child pornography.

Section 2252A(a)(5)(B) criminalizes the knowing possession of child pornography that has traveled between states or between countries. Hilton's First Amendment challenge involved the definition of \"child pornography\" in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2256(8). That provision defines child pornography to include \"any visual depiction, including any photograph, film, video, picture, or computer or computer-generated image or picture, whether made or produced by electronic, mechanical, or other means, of sexually explicit conduct, where such visual depiction is, or appears to be, of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2256(8)(B). Section 2256(8)(B) was added by Congress in 1996 after finding that \"new photographic and computer imaging technologies make it possible to produce by electronic, mechanical, or other means, visual depictions of what <i>appear to be</i> children engaging in sexually explicit conduct that are virtually indistinguishable to the unsuspecting viewer from unretouched photographic images of actual children engaging in sexually explicit conduct.\" Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-208, div. A, tit. I, &#167; 121(1)(5), 110 Stat. 3009-26 (1996) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hilton argued that this new definition violated the First Amendment by prohibiting some adult pornography &#8212; that appearing to be of children &#8212; and by virtue of vagueness and overbreadth. The district court agreed, holding that the CPPA's \"appears to be\" provision was overbroad and left unclear exactly what images were illegal. The district court dismissed the indictment on March 26, 1998. <i>United States v.

Hilton waived his right to a jury trial. After the issuance of a superseding indictment on January 5, 2000, the district court heard the case against Hilton over the course of three days. This court reviewed the district court's findings extensively in <i>United States v.

Here we concentrate on the evidence at issue in this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The search of Hilton's computer room on November 7, 1997, produced a number of pornographic images. These were found on a Sony Backup Tape, in Hilton's hard drive, and printed up and stored in a \"gray box.\" According to Agent Marx of the local police, whom the parties stipulated as a computer forensics expert, the Sony Backup Tape was used to back up Hilton's computer two months before seizure. The Sony tape contained thousands of images; the government introduced seven of them. The \"gray box\" contained a print-out with four images identical to four in the Sony tape. The hard drive contained three images, and this court on review found two to be non-explicit. <i>See Hilton IV,</i> 257 F.3d at 58.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prove that these images depicted children, rather than adults, the government introduced the testimony of Dr. Lawrence Ricci. Dr. Ricci testified as to the Tanner Scale and its application to the seized images. The Tanner Scale was developed through analysis of many children both in the United States and throughout the world and provides a basis for estimating a person's stage of physiological development. Dr. Ricci marked on the backs of the images his opinion as to the children's ages. In his opinion, apart from an image that morphed a child's face with an adult woman's body, the other nine images represented children at various stages of development, ranging from pre-school to young teen. <i>See Hilton III,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">894679</span></span> at *7, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. Dist.

The court also found the required element of scienter and an interstate nexus. Since the court did not find merit in Hilton's affirmative defenses that he was possessing the images under authority of the government, it convicted Hilton on June 30, 2000, and subsequently sentenced him to forty months imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hilton appealed his conviction, challenging the constitutionality of the CPPA and the sufficiency of the evidence. He reiterated his affirmative defense that he had collected the images at the government's request. <i>Hilton IV,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199515\"><a href=\"/opinion/199515/united-states-v-hilton/\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>. Hilton also claimed that the district court erred in his sentencing. We rejected all but the sentencing claim. Since we concluded that two of the three hard drive images did not qualify as child pornography or involve the sexual exploitation of a minor, we remanded for resentencing because the record did not support the Sentencing Guidelines upward adjustment applied by the district court for possession of \"ten or more ... items, containing a visual depiction involving the sexual exploitation of a minor.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 2G2.4(b)(2); <i>see Hilton IV,</i> 257 F.3d at 58.

Those two cases viewed the trade in and possession of child pornography as bearing a proximate link to the child abuse that produced the images in the first place. <i>See Free Speech Coalition,</i> 535 U.S. at 249-50, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118496\"><a href=\"/opinion/118496/ashcroft-v-free-speech-coalition/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Contrary to our earlier conclusion in <i>Hilton II,</i> 167 F.3d at 72-74, the Court held that the availability of virtual child pornography to child abusers does not provide a basis for the prohibition because while \"[t]he objective is to prohibit illegal conduct ... this restriction goes well beyond that interest by restricting the speech available to law-abiding adults.\" <i>Id.</i> at 252-53, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118496\"><a href=\"/opinion/118496/ashcroft-v-free-speech-coalition/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

As for the concern that virtual child pornography motivates child abuse, the Court disagreed with the premise behind the government's argument: \"[t]he mere tendency of speech to encourage unlawful acts is not a sufficient reason for banning it.\" <i>Free Speech Coalition,</i> 535 U.S. at 253, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118496\"><a href=\"/opinion/118496/ashcroft-v-free-speech-coalition/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Because \"[t]he Government has shown no more than a remote connection between speech that might encourage thoughts or impulses and any resulting child abuse,\" it \"may not prohibit speech on the ground that it may encourage pedophiles to engage in illegal conduct.\" <i>Id.</i> at 253-54, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118496\"><a href=\"/opinion/118496/ashcroft-v-free-speech-coalition/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

If virtual images were identical to illegal child pornography, the illegal images would be driven from the market by the indistinguishable substitutes. Few pornographers would risk prosecution by abusing real children if fictional, computerized images would suffice.\" <i>Id.</i> To the government's claim that indistinguishability meant that the successful prosecution of actual child pornography necessitated criminalization of virtual child pornography, the Court responded: \"[t]he argument, in essence, is that protected speech may be banned as a means to ban unprotected speech.

Dr. Ricci's testimony and image-by-image evaluations supported the district court's finding that the images represented children rather than adults. The government argues that in proving that the images represented children, Dr. Ricci also made the case that the children were real. In the government's own words:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"Tanner Scale\" was developed through an analysis of \"large numbers of children\" both in the United States and throughout the world.

Whatever parameters of body proportion, growth and development serve as signs of age under the Tanner Scale, those parameters will be mimicked by the virtual pornographer &#8212; whether by design or as a byproduct of the goal of realism. What a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt demands is evidence that the indicators of youth apparent to the untrained eye belong to an actual child. Accordingly, we find the government's contention that Dr. Ricci presented sufficient evidence to prove that the children represented were real unavailing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to <i>Free Speech Coalition,</i> Congress rewrote the invalidated sections of the CPPA.

The Court found this \"hypothesis [to be] somewhat implausible.\" It reasoned, \"[I]f virtual images were identical to illegal child pornography, the illegal images would be driven from the market by the indistinguishable substitutes. Few pornographers would risk prosecution by abusing real children if fictional, computerized images would suffice.\" <i>Id.</i> at 254, 122 S.Ct. 1751.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> The import of this statement is that the typical consumer of child pornography can differentiate between real and virtual depictions of child pornography.

Oct.10, 2003) (holding that under Virginia child pornography statute \"the Commonwealth may seek to rely upon the images themselves without the necessity for expert opinion\" to prove that pictures depict images of actual children). In my view, there is nothing about this case that provides a substantial reason to decline to follow the Supreme Court's guidance on this issue and to reject the holdings of our companion courts that evidence in addition to the image itself is not required to prove that the pornographic picture depicts an actual child.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority opinion suggests that testimony by a computer graphics expert or evidence identifying the depicted child could satisfy the additional burden that the government must now meet to prove that the picture at issue shows a real child. <i>Ante</i> at 65 n. 6. After <i>Free Speech Coalition,</i> defendants will certainly argue that the government has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the pictures are of real children. And, in light of evolving technology, triers of fact may be more inclined to accept such arguments if the government relies on only the pictures as evidence. Nevertheless, it is one thing to acknowledge that the government could benefit from introducing additional evidence and quite another to insist that the government introduce such evidence in every case regardless of the circumstances. I would not require that, as a general rule, the government must introduce additional evidence to meet its burden of proving that the pictures at issue depict actual children.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although I believe that there was sufficient evidence to sustain Hilton's conviction based on the government's presentation of the images in his possession, I nevertheless agree that Hilton's conviction must be vacated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Hilton's trial occurred before <i>Free Speech Coalition,</i> the government was not required to prove that the pictures at issue depicted actual children to gain a conviction. As a result, the trier of fact did not find that the pictures in Hilton's possession depicted actual children as is required for a valid conviction. <i>See ante</i> at 63 (stating that parties agree that <i>Free Speech Coalition</i> applies retroactively to Hilton's conviction). The failure of the trier of fact to find every element of a crime (even though sufficient evidence on the element was presented at trial) is a constitutional error that sometimes requires reversal. <i>See United States v. Gaudin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117958\"><a href=\"/opinion/117958/united-states-v-gaudin/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">506</span></a></span>, 511, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117958\"><a href=\"/opinion/117958/united-states-v-gaudin/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The trial transcript is not part of the appellate record, which makes conducting a harmless error review all the more difficult.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> <i>See id.</i> at 1415. While the record before us includes the pictures in Hilton's possession, I cannot tell what other evidence, if any, would support a harmless error conclusion. Indeed, I cannot even discern how the pictures were introduced at trial or what evidence was given to the trier of fact about them by either party. While the pictures alone can constitute evidence sufficient to sustain a CPPA conviction, I am not prepared to say, on this incomplete record and without argument from the parties, that they are enough to conclude that the fact finder's failure to find that the images in Hilton's possession were of actual children was a harmless error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> The issue here concerns only the evidence necessary to distinguish between actual and virtual images of child pornography.
