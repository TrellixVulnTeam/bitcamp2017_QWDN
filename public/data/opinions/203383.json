Silsby, United\nStates Attorney, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n                             July 10, 2008\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Northern District of Florida, sitting by designation.\n\f          Stafford, Senior District Judge.          Jorge Antonio Matos\n\n(\"Defendant\"), appeals from his sentence on a guilty plea to one\n\ncount of conspiracy to distribute and to possess with the intent to\n\ndistribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base.         We affirm.\n\n          Among other things, Defendant contends that his sentence\n\nwas unreasonable because the district court did not address the\n\nreasonableness   of   the   crack   cocaine   to   powder   cocaine   ratio\n\ninherent in the Sentencing Guidelines (\"Guidelines\").             Because\n\nDefendant failed to raise this issue in the district court, we\n\nreview for plain error.1     To vacate Defendant's sentence for plain\n\nerror, we must find that (1) there was error; (2) the error was\n\nplain and obvious; (3) the error affected Defendant's substantial\n\nrights; and (4) the error impaired the fairness, integrity, or\n\npublic reputation of the judicial proceedings.          United States v.\n\nDuarte, 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n          In Kimbrough v. United States, 128 S. Ct. 558 (2007), the\n\nSupreme Court held that district courts are free to consider, as\n\npart of their analysis of the sentencing factors set forth in 18\n\n\n     1\n       While conceding that defense counsel did not object to the\ntrial judge's failure to consider the crack to powder disparity,\nDefendant maintains that plain error is not the appropriate\nstandard of review because the judge purportedly failed to give\ndefense counsel an opportunity to object. According to Defendant,\nthe judge went—in one breath—from announcing the applicable\nGuidelines range to pronouncing that he was going to sentence\nDefendant to a below-the-Guidelines sentence, thus allowing no time\nfor defense counsel to raise the Kimbrough issue. Review of the\nrecord convinces us, however, that defense counsel had ample\nopportunity to raise a Kimbrough issue.\n\n                                    -2-\n\fU.S.C. § 3553(a), the 100:1 crack cocaine to powder cocaine ratio\n\nused by the Sentencing Commission in setting sentencing ranges\n\nunder the Guidelines. Prior to Kimbrough, this court had held that\n\na sentencing court was without authority to make a \"categorical,\n\npolicy-based rejection of the 100:1 ratio.\"           United States v. Pho,\n\n433 F.3d 53, 62 (1st Cir. 2006).       In effect, Kimbrough changed the\n\nlandscape in this circuit regarding the sentencing court's ability\n\nto depart from the Guidelines based on drug disparities.\n\n           Finding no on-point circuit precedent to guide our plain\n\nerror analysis in a Kimbrough context, we turn to United States v.\n\nAntonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 77-82 (1st Cir. 2005), wherein this\n\ncourt set forth standards of review applicable to unpreserved\n\nclaims of sentencing error in the aftermath of United States v.\n\nBooker, 543 U.S. 220, 245 (2005) (holding that the Guidelines are\n\nadvisory   and   not   mandatory).         In   Antonakopoulos,   the   court\n\ndetermined that, to satisfy the third and fourth prongs of the\n\nplain error test in a Booker context, a defendant who is sentenced\n\nunder a mandatory Guidelines system must demonstrate a reasonable\n\nprobability that he would have received a more lenient sentence\n\nunder an advisory Guidelines scheme.\n\n           Because we find no reason to treat plain error analysis\n\nin a Kimbrough context differently from plain error analysis in a\n\nBooker context, we conclude that Defendant here must demonstrate a\n\nreasonable probability that he would have received a more lenient\n\nsentence had the district court considered the crack to powder\n\n                                     -3-\n\fcocaine disparity when sentencing Defendant.                  Defendant, however,\n\npoints to nothing in the record, nor can we find anything in the\n\nrecord, to suggest that the district court would have imposed a\n\nmore lenient sentence had it been asked to consider the crack to\n\npowder disparity.      As explicitly stated by the district court, the\n\ncircumstances     of     Defendant's        offense     and   \"the     reasons    for\n\npunishment in terms of deterrence, punishment, protection of the\n\ncommunity, all of those . . . abundantly here justify the sentence\n\nthat I'm going to impose.\"              Defendant having thus failed to\n\nestablish plain error, we decline to vacate Defendant's sentence\n\nbased on his disparity argument.\n\n             Defendant     also   contends       that     the    district        court\n\ncommitted     procedural    error      by     failing    to     give    a   reasoned\n\nexplanation for its choice of sentence, imposed an inherently\n\nunreasonable sentence given that Defendant is middle-aged and has\n\nno   prior   criminal     history,     and    erroneously       presumed     that    a\n\nGuidelines sentence was reasonable.              We find no merit to any of\n\nthese contentions.\n\n             We accordingly AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.\n\nWe REMAND the case to the district court where Defendant may file,\n\nif he wishes, a motion for reduction in sentence pursuant to the\n\nrecent Guidelines amendment that lowers the Guidelines sentencing\n\nrange for certain categories of offenses involving crack cocaine.\n\nU.S.S.G.
