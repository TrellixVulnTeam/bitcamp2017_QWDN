Petitioner Carlos Alberto Betancur\n\nLópez, a native and citizen of Colombia, seeks review of the Board\n\nof Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") decision affirming the Immigration\n\nJudge's (\"IJ\") decision denying Betancur's application for asylum.\n\nThe IJ had found that Betancur failed to meet his burden of either\n\nestablishing past persecution or a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution.    We deny the petition for review.\n\n                                    I.\n\n           Carlos    Alberto   Betancur    López   (\"Betancur\"),    is   a\n\n20-year-old citizen of Colombia.           Betancur entered the United\n\nStates on August 4, 2002 in Miami, Florida, and applied for asylum.\n\nImmigration officials interviewed him at the airport and paroled\n\nhim into the United States after determining that he had a credible\n\nfear of persecution.      He was charged with removability pursuant to\n\n§§ 212(a)(6)(C)(i) and 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) of the Immigration and\n\nNationality Act.      At his hearing before the IJ on December 12,\n\n2003, Betancur conceded removability.        The IJ then took testimony\n\non his application for asylum, and also considered his claims for\n\nwithholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against\n\nTorture (\"CAT\").\n\nA.   Betancur's testimony\n\n           As a 19-year-old in Colombia, working on his family's\n\nfarm, he was approached by a group of men who identified themselves\n\nas   members   of   the   \"Revolutionary   Armed   Forces   of   Colombia\"\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\f(\"FARC\").     FARC is Colombia's largest and most active guerrilla\n\norganization and has employed extortion, kidnaping, and murder to\n\nfurther its political and economic objectives.   Betancur testified\n\nthat the guerrillas asked him to join FARC and stated that \"life\n\ncould be rough\" if he refused.    He refused, and later received a\n\nphone call at his farm and a separate phone call to his home,\n\ndemanding that he join FARC.   He again refused, and the guerrillas\n\ntold him that \"[he] should be careful because the offense [he] had\n\nmade against them was unforgiveable.\"\n\n            At his father's urging, Betancur left his home and farm\n\nand went to the home of an uncle in Medellín, approximately one\n\nhour and fifteen minutes away by car.       He stayed in hiding in\n\nMedellín for three weeks before leaving for the United States.\n\nAfter Betancur left Colombia, the guerrillas began to extort\n\n\"protection payments\" from his father, and told his father that if\n\nhis son \"ever come[s] back, he should forget that he ever had a\n\nson.\"   Betancur testified that his family could not safely avoid\n\nFARC retribution by relocating to Medellín because \"FARC has people\n\neverywhere, including in Medellin.\"    As of the time of the removal\n\nhearing, Betancur testified that his father continues to make\n\nmonthly payments to FARC and no one in his family has been\n\nphysically harmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fB.   The decisions of the IJ and the BIA\n\n           The IJ found Betancur's testimony credible.            However, he\n\nconcluded that, \"as an objective matter, the conditions [Betancur]\n\nfaced in Colombia fall short of the standard for asylum, let alone\n\nwithholding of removal.\"      The IJ noted that \"[i]t does appear that\n\nonce [Betancur] refused to join the FARC . . . their threats could\n\nbe   construed   as   harm   threatened    on   account   of   his    political\n\nopinion.\" However, the IJ noted that while it is \"deplorable\" that\n\n\"farm owners are frequently either forced off their land or forced\n\nto provide protection money to various groups,\" the IJ concluded\n\n\"that is not, in the Court's estimation, what Congress contemplated\n\nwhen enacting the refugee statutes and creating asylum for people\n\nhere in the United States. . . .                [Betancur] does not have,\n\nobjectively speaking, reasons to fear persecution, that is harm\n\ninflicted upon him on account of his political opinion, race,\n\nreligion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group.\"\n\nThe IJ also stated that, \"in the Court's estimation, [Betancur]\n\ncould have lived elsewhere in Colombia, and although perhaps facing\n\na generalized threat of forced recruitment or other violence, did\n\nnot [] appear to have objectively any reason to fear that members\n\nof the FARC would come looking for him on account of his refusing\n\nto join them.\"\n\n           Because     the   IJ   concluded     that   Betancur      failed   to\n\nestablish a well-founded fear of persecution meriting the grant of\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fasylum,   the   IJ   also   concluded       that      the   petitioner    failed    to\n\nestablish the higher burden for withholding of removal.                        The IJ\n\nalso denied him CAT relief because he made no claim that the\n\ngovernment would torture him or acquiesce to his torture on his\n\nreturn to Colombia.       The IJ thus ordered him removed.\n\n             Betancur appealed to the BIA, which issued a per curiam\n\ndecision.    The BIA noted that it reviewed the record.                  Having done\n\nso, it \"agree[d] that [Betancur] failed to meet his burden of\n\nestablishing past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution\n\non account of one of the statutorily protected grounds, or that it\n\nis more likely than not that he will be persecuted or subjected to\n\ntorture upon his return to Colombia.\"                 The BIA therefore affirmed\n\nthe decision of the IJ.\n\n                                         II.\n\nA.   Standards of review\n\n             We review the factual findings of the BIA under the\n\ndeferential     \"substantial         evidence\"     standard.     See     Romilus    v.\n\nAshcroft,    385   F.3d   1,     5   (1st   Cir.      2004).    \"[A]dministrative\n\nfindings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator\n\nwould   be   compelled      to   conclude        to   the   contrary.\"     8   U.S.C.\n\n§ 1252(b)(4)(B).      We review claims of legal error de novo.                     See\n\nRomilus, 385 F.3d at 5.          \"In this case, where the BIA's decision\n\nadopts portions of the IJ's opinion, we review those portions of\n\n\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fthe IJ's opinion that the BIA has adopted.\"              Romilus, 385 F.3d 1 at\n\n5.\n\n               Betancur bears the burden of establishing eligibility for\n\nasylum    by    demonstrating    that    he   is   a    \"refugee.\"     8   U.S.C.\n\n§ 1158(b)(1)(B)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(a).               A refugee is generally\n\ndefined as any person who is outside his or her home country and\n\n\"is unable or unwilling to return . . . because of persecution or\n\na well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\nopinion.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A). If the applicant establishes\n\npast persecution, there is a legal presumption that the applicant\n\nhas   a   well-founded    fear   of   future    persecution.     See   8   C.F.R.\n\n§ 208.13(b)(1).       To rebut this presumption, the government must\n\nshow by a preponderance of the evidence that \"[t]here has been a\n\nfundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant no\n\nlonger has a well-founded fear of persecution\" or that \"[t]he\n\napplicant could avoid future persecution by relocating to another\n\npart of the applicant's country of nationality . . . and under all\n\nthe circumstances, it would be reasonable to expect the applicant\n\nto do so.\"       8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1)(i).           If the applicant has not\n\nestablished past persecution, the applicant retains the burden of\n\nestablishing future persecution. See Palma-Mazariegos v. Gonzales,\n\n428 F.3d 30, 35 (1st Cir. 2005).              \"Such a showing involves both\n\nsubjective and objective components.            The first component entails\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fa showing that the asylum seeker's fear of future persecution is\n\ngenuine.     The second component entails a showing that this fear is\n\nobjectively reasonable.\"       Id. (internal citations omitted).\n\n             In this case, the BIA found that Betancur had failed to\n\nestablish    past    persecution   or   a   well-founded    fear    of    future\n\npersecution.      Betancur challenges both of these determinations.\n\nFirst, he asserts that he has established past persecution, arguing\n\nthat   the   IJ   implicitly    found   that   he   had    established     past\n\npersecution based on imputed political opinion and therefore erred\n\nin assigning him the burden of establishing that relocation would\n\nbe unsafe.    Second, he argues that, even if he has not established\n\npast persecution, he has established a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution and that he could not safely relocate to another part\n\nof Colombia.\n\nB.   Past persecution\n\n             There   is   substantial   evidence    to    support   the   BIA's\n\ndetermination that Betancur had not established past persecution.\n\nThe BIA did not supply its own reasoning in its affirmance of the\n\nIJ's decision, only stating that it \"agreed that [Betancur] failed\n\nto meet his burden of establishing past persecution.\" The IJ found\n\nthat \"[i]t does appear that once [Betancur] refused to join the\n\nFARC . . . their threats could be construed as harm threatened on\n\naccount of his political opinion.\" However, the IJ also found that\n\nthe type of harm that Betancur and his family suffered due to his\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\frepeated refusal to join FARC -– i.e., economic extortion -- \"is\n\nnot . . . what Congress contemplated when enacting the refugee\n\nstatutes and creating asylum for people here in the United States.\"\n\nThis harm was part of the \"deplorable situation [in Colombia] in\n\nwhich    both    FARC    and   the   paramilitaries    wreak   havoc   upon   the\n\ncivilian population\" but it did not constitute \"persecution\" within\n\nthe meaning of asylum law.\n\n            The record does not compel a contrary determination. \"To\n\nestablish       past    persecution   more    than   harassment   or   spasmodic\n\nmistreatment . . . must be shown.\"            Guzman v. INS, 327 F.3d 11, 15\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).           \"[I]nconvenience, unpleasantness, and even a\n\nmodicum of suffering may not be enough to meet th[e] benchmark [for\n\n'persecution'].\"         Negeya v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 78, 83 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).      Here, the record does not compel a finding that the\n\nguerrillas' demands that Betancur join their forces, and their\n\neconomic extortion, rose to the level of persecution.              See Guzman,\n\n327 F.3d at 16 (finding that a \"one-time kidnaping and beating [by\n\npossible guerrilla forces] falls well short of establishing 'past\n\npersecution'\").          Having failed to establish past persecution,\n\nBetancur had the burden of establishing future persecution.1\n\n\n     1\n       Betancur argues that the IJ erred by placing the burden of\nestablishing the futility of relocation on him.      However, this\nargument is predicated on Betancur's contention that he established\npast persecution. See 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1)(ii) (stating that\nthe government has the burden of establishing the possibility and\nreasonableness of relocation where the asylum applicant has\nestablished past persecution).      Since we have rejected that\n\n                                        -8-\n\fC.   Future persecution\n\n           The IJ held that Betancur's fear of future persecution on\n\nthe basis of political opinion was not objectively reasonable. \"To\n\nsatisfy the 'objectively reasonable' component of the [well-founded\n\nfear of persecution] test, an applicant must usually provide\n\nevidence that there is a reasonable possibility he or she would be\n\nsingled out individually for persecution.\"   Pieterson v. Ashcroft,\n\n364 F.3d 38, 43 (1st Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitation omitted).   The IJ noted that the possibility of harm that\n\nBetancur faced on return to Colombia was the same harm that other\n\nColombians faced generally, and that he had not established that\n\nthe guerrillas would persecute him on his return because of his\n\npolitical opinion.     Notably, the petitioner himself lived in\n\nMedellín for three weeks without incident prior to his departure\n\nfrom Colombia.   While his father has been subject to demands for\n\nprotection money, neither his father nor any other family members\n\nhave been harmed.    On these facts, the BIA was not compelled to\n\nfind that Betancur established a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution.   See Guzman, 327 F.3d at 16 (finding no well-founded\n\nfear of future persecution where \"[t]he record established that\n\nother relatives of Guzman have lived, undisturbed, in Guatemala for\n\nmore than a decade\"); Aguilar-Solis v. INS, 168 F.3d 565, 573 (1st\n\n\n\nargument, there is no basis for the petitioner's challenge to the\nIJ's allocation of the burden on the relocation issue.\n\n                                -9-\n\fCir.       1999)   (\"The   fact   that   close   relatives   continue   to   live\n\npeacefully in the alien's homeland undercuts the alien's claim that\n\npersecution awaits his return.\").2\n\n               For these reasons, the petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n       2\n       On appeal, Betancur makes no argument regarding the BIA's\ndenial of his withholding of removal and CAT claims. Thus, those\nclaims have been waived. See Tai v. Gonzales, 423 F.3d 1, 6 (1st\nCir. 2005). Even if Betancur had not waived his withholding claim,\n\"[b]ecause the standard for withholding deportation is more\nstringent than that for asylum, a petitioner unable to satisfy the\nasylum standard fails, a fortiori, to satisfy the former.\"\nMediouni v. INS, 314 F.3d 24, 27 (1st Cir. 2002) (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n                                         -10-\n\f",

The IJ then took testimony\n\non his application for asylum, and also considered his claims for\n\nwithholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against\n\nTorture (\"CAT\").\n\nA.   Betancur's testimony\n\n           As a 19-year-old in Colombia, working on his family's\n\nfarm, he was approached by a group of men who identified themselves\n\nas   members   of   the   \"Revolutionary   Armed   Forces   of   Colombia\"\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\f(\"FARC\").

[Betancur] does not have,\n\nobjectively speaking, reasons to fear persecution, that is harm\n\ninflicted upon him on account of his political opinion, race,\n\nreligion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group.\"\n\nThe IJ also stated that, \"in the Court's estimation, [Betancur]\n\ncould have lived elsewhere in Colombia, and although perhaps facing\n\na generalized threat of forced recruitment or other violence, did\n\nnot [] appear to have objectively any reason to fear that members\n\nof the FARC would come looking for him on account of his refusing\n\nto join them.\"\n\n           Because     the   IJ   concluded     that   Betancur      failed   to\n\nestablish a well-founded fear of persecution meriting the grant of\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fasylum,   the   IJ   also   concluded       that      the   petitioner    failed    to\n\nestablish the higher burden for withholding of removal.                        The IJ\n\nalso denied him CAT relief because he made no claim that the\n\ngovernment would torture him or acquiesce to his torture on his\n\nreturn to Colombia.       The IJ thus ordered him removed.\n\n             Betancur appealed to the BIA, which issued a per curiam\n\ndecision.    The BIA noted that it reviewed the record.                  Having done\n\nso, it \"agree[d] that [Betancur] failed to meet his burden of\n\nestablishing past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution\n\non account of one of the statutorily protected grounds, or that it\n\nis more likely than not that he will be persecuted or subjected to\n\ntorture upon his return to Colombia.\"                 The BIA therefore affirmed\n\nthe decision of the IJ.\n\n                                         II.\n\nA.

A refugee is generally\n\ndefined as any person who is outside his or her home country and\n\n\"is unable or unwilling to return . . . because of persecution or\n\na well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\nopinion.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A). If the applicant establishes\n\npast persecution, there is a legal presumption that the applicant\n\nhas   a   well-founded    fear   of   future    persecution.     See   8   C.F.R.\n\n§ 208.13(b)(1).       To rebut this presumption, the government must\n\nshow by a preponderance of the evidence that \"[t]here has been a\n\nfundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant no\n\nlonger has a well-founded fear of persecution\" or that \"[t]he\n\napplicant could avoid future persecution by relocating to another\n\npart of the applicant's country of nationality . . . and under all\n\nthe circumstances, it would be reasonable to expect the applicant\n\nto do so.\"       8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1)(i).           If the applicant has not\n\nestablished past persecution, the applicant retains the burden of\n\nestablishing future persecution. See Palma-Mazariegos v.

The second component entails a showing that this fear is\n\nobjectively reasonable.\"       Id. (internal citations omitted).\n\n             In this case, the BIA found that Betancur had failed to\n\nestablish    past    persecution   or   a   well-founded    fear    of    future\n\npersecution.      Betancur challenges both of these determinations.\n\nFirst, he asserts that he has established past persecution, arguing\n\nthat   the   IJ   implicitly    found   that   he   had    established     past\n\npersecution based on imputed political opinion and therefore erred\n\nin assigning him the burden of establishing that relocation would\n\nbe unsafe.    Second, he argues that, even if he has not established\n\npast persecution, he has established a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution and that he could not safely relocate to another part\n\nof Colombia.\n\nB.   Past persecution\n\n             There   is   substantial   evidence    to    support   the   BIA's\n\ndetermination that Betancur had not established past persecution.\n\nThe BIA did not supply its own reasoning in its affirmance of the\n\nIJ's decision, only stating that it \"agreed that [Betancur] failed\n\nto meet his burden of establishing past persecution.\" The IJ found\n\nthat \"[i]t does appear that once [Betancur] refused to join the\n\nFARC . . . their threats could be construed as harm threatened on\n\naccount of his political opinion.\" However, the IJ also found that\n\nthe type of harm that Betancur and his family suffered due to his\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\frepeated refusal to join FARC -– i.e., economic extortion -- \"is\n\nnot . . . what Congress contemplated when enacting the refugee\n\nstatutes and creating asylum for people here in the United States.\"\n\nThis harm was part of the \"deplorable situation [in Colombia] in\n\nwhich    both    FARC    and   the   paramilitaries    wreak   havoc   upon   the\n\ncivilian population\" but it did not constitute \"persecution\" within\n\nthe meaning of asylum law.\n\n            The record does not compel a contrary determination. \"To\n\nestablish       past    persecution   more    than   harassment   or   spasmodic\n\nmistreatment . . . must be shown.\"            Guzman v.

Here, the record does not compel a finding that the\n\nguerrillas' demands that Betancur join their forces, and their\n\neconomic extortion, rose to the level of persecution.              See Guzman,\n\n327 F.3d at 16 (finding that a \"one-time kidnaping and beating [by\n\npossible guerrilla forces] falls well short of establishing 'past\n\npersecution'\").          Having failed to establish past persecution,\n\nBetancur had the burden of establishing future persecution.1\n\n\n     1\n       Betancur argues that the IJ erred by placing the burden of\nestablishing the futility of relocation on him.      However, this\nargument is predicated on Betancur's contention that he established\npast persecution. See 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1)(ii) (stating that\nthe government has the burden of establishing the possibility and\nreasonableness of relocation where the asylum applicant has\nestablished past persecution).

Future persecution\n\n           The IJ held that Betancur's fear of future persecution on\n\nthe basis of political opinion was not objectively reasonable. \"To\n\nsatisfy the 'objectively reasonable' component of the [well-founded\n\nfear of persecution] test, an applicant must usually provide\n\nevidence that there is a reasonable possibility he or she would be\n\nsingled out individually for persecution.\"   Pieterson v. Ashcroft,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200965\"><a href=\"/opinion/200965/pieterson-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">364</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 43 (1st Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitation omitted).   The IJ noted that the possibility of harm that\n\nBetancur faced on return to Colombia was the same harm that other\n\nColombians faced generally, and that he had not established that\n\nthe guerrillas would persecute him on his return because of his\n\npolitical opinion.     Notably, the petitioner himself lived in\n\nMedellín for three weeks without incident prior to his departure\n\nfrom Colombia.   While his father has been subject to demands for\n\nprotection money, neither his father nor any other family members\n\nhave been harmed.    On these facts, the BIA was not compelled to\n\nfind that Betancur established a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution.   See Guzman, 327 F.3d at 16 (finding no well-founded\n\nfear of future persecution where \"[t]he record established that\n\nother relatives of Guzman have lived, undisturbed, in Guatemala for\n\nmore than a decade\"); Aguilar-Solis v.

Thus, those\nclaims have been waived. See Tai v.

Even if Betancur had not waived his withholding claim,\n\"[b]ecause the standard for withholding deportation is more\nstringent than that for asylum, a petitioner unable to satisfy the\nasylum standard fails, a fortiori, to satisfy the former.\"\nMediouni v.
