On December 3, 2004, a forty-foot-\n\nlong wooden yawl carrying ninety-two aliens from the Dominican\n\nRepublic capsized off the coast of Vega Alta, Puerto Rico, after a\n\nthirty-hour journey over rough seas from Cabeza del Toro, a beach\n\nin the Dominican Republic.       The U.S. Coast Guard and Puerto Rico\n\nauthorities brought eighty-five of the passengers safely to shore;\n\nseven others were confirmed dead at the scene.\n\n            Based on identifications made by some of the passengers\n\non   the     beach,     five   individuals--Leonardo     Hilario-Hilario\n\n(\"Hilario\"), Kennedi Martinez (\"Martinez\"), Fernando Jose Milan\n\n(\"Milan\"), Delgadino Peguero (\"Peguero\"), and Santiago Rodriguez\n\n(\"Rodriguez\")--were separated out as those who had conducted the\n\nsmuggling    venture.      Although    generally   referred   to   by   the\n\ngovernment as \"captains,\"       Hilario turned out to be the man in\n\ncharge and the others, although sometimes involved in piloting,\n\nwere crew.\n\n            After further investigation, all five defendants were\n\ncharged on May 17, 2005, in a second superseding indictment,\n\nalleging that\n\n            aiding and abetting each other, [they] did,\n            knowingly, willfully and intentionally, bring\n            and attempt to bring to the United States, for\n            private financial gain and profit, and by the\n            use of an unseaworthy and overcrowded yawl\n            which placed in jeopardy the lives of the\n            aliens, approximately eighty-seven (87) aliens\n            . . . . This violation resulted in the death\n            of [seven passengers].\"\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f             Fairly read, this formulation, although jumbled, charged\n\neach defendant with both the central offense of smuggling an alien\n\ninto   the   United   States   or   attempting   to   do   so,   8   U.S.C.   §\n\n1324(a)(1)(A)(i) (2000), and the separately enumerated offense of\n\naiding and abetting such an offense, id. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(v)(II).\n\nOne who aids and abets is normally liable as a principal, 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2 (2000), but the smuggling statute prescribes in certain cases\n\na lower sentence for mere aiders and abettors.                   8 U.S.C. §\n\n1324(a)(1)(B).\n\n             The references in the indictment to financial gain,\n\nplacing life in jeopardy or committing an offense resulting in\n\ndeath invoked provisions of the statute's sentencing regime.             Each\n\none of these characteristics raises the maximum sentence available.\n\n8 U.S.C. §§ 1324(a)(1)(B)(i), (iii), (iv). Although pertinent only\n\nto sentencing, a jury determination typically is required to invoke\n\nthe higher sentences under familiar precedent.             Apprendi v. New\n\nJersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000).\n\n             A fifteen-day jury trial followed at which ten of the\n\npassengers testified.     The government relied heavily on eyewitness\n\ntestimony to establish that the five defendants operated the\n\nvessel.      Several passengers testified that Milan, Peguero, and\n\nRodriguez piloted the yawl at various points during the journey;\n\nMartinez was identified as having navigated and steered the vessel\n\nwith the help of a GPS or similar device, and Hilario was described\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fas the \"head captain\" who gave orders to the others and maintained\n\ncontact via cellular telephone with other organizers on land.\n\n               The   government      also    presented         evidence    to    show    the\n\nunseaworthiness          of   the   vessel.       The    passengers       described       the\n\novercrowded, unsafe, and unsanitary conditions on the vessel.\n\nThree members of the Coast Guard, who had participated in the\n\nrescue       efforts,     described    the    conditions            of   the    surf,    the\n\nrudimentary construction of the yawl (which had fallen apart in the\n\nsurf       along   the   Vega   Alta   coast),          and   the    vessel's     lack    of\n\nbathrooms,         lights,    seats,    radio,          or    appropriate       safety    or\n\nnavigational equipment.\n\n               All five defendants were convicted on the indictment\n\ncount set forth above.1             Pursuant to a special verdict, the jury\n\nfound that all defendants acted for the purpose of financial gain,\n\nand all except Rodriguez placed the lives of the passengers in\n\njeopardy and had participated in an offense resulting in the death\n\nof seven passengers. The district court later sentenced Hilario to\n\n204 months in prison, Martinez and Peguero to 188 months, Milan to\n\n176 months, and Rodriguez to 120 months.\n\n               All five now appeal their convictions and sentences,\n\narguing that various decisions made by the district judge deprived\n\nthem of a fair trial and that their sentences were improper.                             Some\n\n\n       1\n      The indictment also included a separate count against Peguero\nfor intimidating witnesses but the jury acquitted on this count and\nit is not at issue on appeal.\n\n                                            -6-\n\fof these arguments are pressed by all five defendants while others\n\nare unique to particular defendants.               We begin with the collective\n\nattacks and then turn to the individual ones.                     The standard of\n\nreview varies with the issue.\n\n              All five defendants argue that pretrial identification,\n\nby    means   of   the    photograph     line-up    shown    to   the    cooperating\n\nwitnesses,      was      so   suggestive     that    it    fatally      tainted    the\n\nidentification evidence at trial.                The completed photo line-up\n\ncontained fifty-eight color head shots of those taken from the\n\nwaters alive, including all of the men; some of the women were\n\nincluded but others were left out after one of the prosecutors said\n\nthat it was unnecessary to include the women.\n\n              The fifty-eight photographs were arranged nine per-page\n\n(leaving four for the last page) in the order in which the subjects\n\nwere processed by immigration officials. Since the five defendants\n\nhad    been   separated       from   the    remaining      detainees,     they    were\n\nphotographed last and appear in the final five photographs in the\n\nset.    This was shown to the passengers who were willing to identify\n\nthe \"captains.\"       Thirty-seven passengers identified Hilario, forty\n\nidentified Rodriguez, thirty-five identified Milan, twenty-seven\n\nidentified Martinez, and nineteen identified Peguero.\n\n              At trial, the defendants sought to have the photo line-up\n\nsuppressed      and      to   prohibit     in-court       identification    of    the\n\ndefendants as tainted.           The district court denied the motion and\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\fthe government introduced the line-up and relied heavily at trial\n\non in-court identification by the testifying passengers.       Our\n\nreview of the district court's denial of the motion to suppress the\n\nphoto identification is plenary save that findings of fact are\n\nreviewed for clear error. United States v. Holliday, 457 F.3d 121,\n\n125 (1st Cir. 2006), cert. denied, 127 S. Ct. 1317 (2007).\n\n           The defendants contend that the introduction of this\n\nidentification evidence undermined their right to a fair trial.\n\nSee Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293, 301-02 (1967).    Of all their\n\nattacks on this piece of evidence, the strongest is that the\n\ndefendants' pictures were grouped together as the last five shown;\n\nand four of the defendants appear in the only pictures on the final\n\npage of the line-up.     Other criticisms can be dealt with more\n\nbriefly.\n\n           The Supreme Court says that a court should first look to\n\nthe procedure itself to determine whether it was impermissibly\n\nsuggestive, United States v. Bouthout, 878 F.2d 1506, 1514 (1st\n\nCir. 1989) (citing Simmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377, 384\n\n(1968)); if so, the court determines whether under the totality of\n\nthe circumstances the suggestiveness is so pronounced that there is\n\na serious likelihood of irreparable misidentification.     Neil v.\n\nBiggers, 409 U.S. 188, 196-97 (1972).\n\n           Suggestiveness is a matter of degree.   In principle, a\n\ngrouping of the defendants together might suggest an association\n\n\n                                -8-\n\famong them; if one were recognized as culpable, this might heighten\n\nthe chance that ones next to him might be so identified even if the\n\nwitness were doubtful. Location at the end seems no more dangerous\n\nthan at the beginning, and the grouping does not appear to be\n\ndeliberate tampering; but we will assume, merely arguendo, that the\n\nline-up was suggestive.\n\n             Yet the risk of prejudice was minimal.             This is not a\n\ncase in which a marginal identification--e.g., by a witness who\n\nonly glimpsed the perpetrator of a crime--may have been bolstered\n\nby suggestive identification procedures.                 See id. at 199-200.\n\nHere, the witnesses identifying the defendants had traveled with\n\nthem for thirty hours at a close distance and without any attempt\n\nby any of the defendants to conceal their appearances during the\n\ntrip.\n\n             Further, the photo array was shown to the passengers on\n\nthe same day as their arrival in Puerto Rico while their memories\n\nof the trip were still fresh.       And defense counsel were given ample\n\ntime    at   trial   to   explore   any   defects   in    the   identification\n\nprocedure--including whether other individuals not pictured in the\n\nphoto array were the true leaders of the smuggling venture--and to\n\nargue those defects to the jury in summation.             The photo array did\n\nnot create a serious risk of misidentification.\n\n             As for the other criticisms, we are unable to discern the\n\n\"marked differences in skin color, clothing, and contrast of\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fcoloring\" that defendants claim rendered the line-up suggestive.\n\nWhile some of the photographs, as the district court pointed out,\n\ndo \"look more like mug shots,\" none of these depicts any of the\n\ndefendants.    Nor were the latter identifications tainted when the\n\ngovernment    at   the   beach--based      on     passenger    identification--\n\nconspicuously separated the defendants from the other passengers.\n\n            The defendants also object to the admission of certain\n\ntestimony given by two Coast Guard officers involved in the rescue,\n\nLieutenants    Lahcen     Armstrong    and       William   Nunes.    Armstrong\n\ntestified extensively about the size and appearance of the yawl,\n\nthe number of passengers, and sea conditions at the time.                    Over\n\nobjection he was allowed to testify about what safety equipment\n\nsuch a vessel should have had (but here didn't) and the maximum\n\nnumber of passengers that could safely be carried.\n\n            Specifically, Armstrong said that such a vessel required\n\n\"properly    maintained    engines     .     .   .   navigational   lights    and\n\nequipment . . . life preservers, for all the people on board,\n\nnavigational charts and potentially GPS electronic devices, [and]\n\nVHS/FM radios\" and that he \"would expect a vessel that size to have\n\nno more than 20 to 30 people on board safely.\"                Nunes stated that\n\na vessel the size of the yawl could not sustain the swells and\n\nrough surf it encountered.\n\n            The objection, duly preserved, is that neither officer\n\nwas specified as an expert in advance of trial, as is required by\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fgoverning rules.      Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(G).            The government\n\nargues    that   no   notice   was       required   because   the   lieutenants\n\ndelivered only lay opinion testimony, which is not subject to Rule\n\n16's disclosure requirements.            The recurring problem is that \"the\n\nsame   witness--for    example,      a    law   enforcement   officer--may   be\n\nqualified to 'provide both lay and expert testimony in a single\n\ncase.'\"    United States v. Ayala-Pizarro, 407 F.3d 25, 28 (1st\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 902 (2005) (quoting Fed. R. Evid.\n\n701, advisory committee's note).\n\n            There is no bright-line rule to separate lay opinion from\n\nexpert witness testimony; circuits, and indeed decisions within a\n\ncircuit, are often in some tension.                 But we think it is quite\n\narguable, and proceed on that arguendo premise, that some of\n\nArmstrong's testimony as to specific necessary safety precautions\n\nand vessel capacity seems to be based on specialized knowledge and\n\nalso to reflect the heightened sophistication normally associated\n\nwith expert testimony.\n\n            But \"[t]o succeed in obtaining a reversal on appeal, a\n\ndefendant must prove both an abuse of discretion and prejudice.\"\n\nUnited States v. Alvarez, 987 F.2d 77, 85 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,\n\n510 U.S. 849 (1993).           Given the lack of any safety or fixed\n\nnavigation equipment and the extraordinary overcrowding, the vessel\n\nwas patently dangerous to life.            Indeed, defense counsel objected\n\nto the introduction of testimony from other Coast Guard officers on\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\fthe ground that it was \"irrelevant or cumulative\" because \"there\n\n[was] no issue that there were unsafe conditions on the boat.\"\n\n           The defendants do not complain that the witnesses were\n\nnot   formally    qualified     as   experts,   presumably     because    their\n\nqualifications were apparent. This does not automatically mitigate\n\na Rule 16 violation if one occurred; the rule helps the opponent to\n\ndevelop cross examination and to retain a counter-expert.                But on\n\nthe   present    facts,   the   witnesses    were     quite   unlikely   to   be\n\nimpeached on their main points and defendants knew at the outset\n\nthat unseaworthiness was a critical issue.\n\n           The defendants further assert that they are entitled to\n\na new trial because the jury selection process did not adequately\n\nprobe jurors' prejudices.        They say that the district court erred\n\nin refusing to ask eighty proposed voir dire questions designed to\n\nuncover, among other things, potential jurors' biases concerning\n\nillegal immigrants, immigration in general, individuals hailing\n\nfrom the Dominican Republic, and prior exposure to the case through\n\nthe media.\n\n           While the trial judge did not ask the precise questions\n\nrequested,   he   conducted     a    thorough   and   searching   voir    dire,\n\ncovering inter alia whether the jurors had pre-existing views of\n\nthe defendants' guilt or innocence; whether they had learned\n\nanything about the case through any media; whether any jurors would\n\nbe prejudiced by evidence of the seven deaths; and, importantly,\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fwhether the jurors had feelings about Dominican nationals or\n\nillegal immigrants that would impair the ability to come to a fair,\n\nimpartial, and just decision.\n\n            Nor did the district court err, as the defendants now\n\nargue,     by   failing   to   question     all   members   of   the   venire\n\nindividually. Individual questioning may sometimes be appropriate,\n\nbut this decision, like most in the conduct of the voir dire, rests\n\nin the district court's sound judgment.           United States v. Orlando-\n\nFigueroa, 229 F.3d 33, 43 (1st Cir. 2000).          Defendants are also far\n\nfrom showing that they were prejudiced by the district court's\n\nhandling of the venire.        See United States v. Misla-Aldarondo, 478\n\nF.3d 52, 60-61 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 128 S. Ct. 132 (2007).\n\n            Next, defendants assail the district court's refusal to\n\nenjoin the government from speaking to the press.                 At trial,\n\nMartinez and Hilario filed separate motions seeking a court order\n\nto enjoin the prosecution from making further statements to the\n\npress; both motions referred to an article published by the San\n\nJuan Star on May 9, 2005, in which the government confirmed the\n\ndate of the upcoming trial and the penalties the government was\n\nseeking.\n\n            In subsequent motions the parties disputed whether other\n\nstatements in the article--including the claim that \"dozens of\n\nsurvivors identified the accused as the organizers of the ill-fated\n\ncrossing\"--were properly attributed to the government in violation\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fof local rules prohibiting prosecutors from publicly commenting on\n\nthe evidence presented at trial.                 We found no recorded ruling by\n\nthe court; conceivably, the matter was dealt with in chambers or\n\nsimply dropped.\n\n            In     all       events,     while     defendants      refer     to     the\n\n\"unprecedented media coverage\" following the rescue and call the\n\npublicity \"inflammatory,\" they do not show that the government was\n\nresponsible for anything beyond a description of the trial date and\n\npenalties sought.        Under these circumstances, we see no basis for\n\nsaying that the failure to issue the requested injunction resulted\n\nin harmful publicity or otherwise prejudiced the defendants.\n\n            We    turn       now   to   the   objections    made    by     individual\n\ndefendants, starting with Milan's claim that his fifth and sixth\n\namendment rights were violated by the admission of statements he\n\nmade to federal agents who interrogated him after his arrest.\n\nMilan was interviewed after his arrest by federal agents in the\n\nearly morning hours of December 4, 2004, and again interrogated by\n\ntwo agents and two prosecutors on the afternoon of December 5,\n\n2004.    In each case he was given Miranda warnings and signed waiver\n\nforms.\n\n            During these interviews, Milan admitted to being involved\n\nin the smuggling venture and confirmed that he had, at times,\n\npiloted the vessel.            He gave other details about the trip and\n\nidentified       from    a    photo     spread    the   pictures    of     the    other\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\findividuals involved and specified those who had controlled the\n\nengines. At trial, the district judge allowed the statements to be\n\nused against Milan, redacting references to other defendants to\n\ncomply with Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123 (1968).           See\n\nRichardson v. Marsh, 481 U.S. 200, 211 (1987).\n\n          Milan says that the second interrogation occurred after\n\na criminal complaint and an arrest warrant had been filed on\n\nDecember 4, 2004, so it was improper not only under Miranda but\n\nbecause the questioning occurred in the absence of counsel after\n\nadversarial proceedings had commenced.        But whether or not a\n\ncriminal complaint begins adversarial proceedings triggering a\n\nright to counsel, cf. Brewer v. Williams, 430 U.S. 387 (1977), a\n\ndefendant can still waive that right.      Patterson v. Illinois, 487\n\nU.S. 285, 290-91 (1988).\n\n          As for Milan's claim that both interviews were unlawful\n\nbecause his Miranda waivers were not knowing and intelligent, the\n\ndistrict judge held a hearing, heard from three of the agents,      and\n\nconsidered   a   proffer   from   Milan.   Milan   cited   his   limited\n\neducation, experience with police in his own country and the trauma\n\nof the boat foundering; the agents described Milan's calm demeanor,\n\nlack of handcuffing and the agents' conduct during the interviews.\n\nThe judge concluded that the waivers were valid.\n\n          \"The voluntariness of a waiver . . . has always depended\n\non the absence of police overreaching, not on 'free choice' in any\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\fbroader sense of the word.\"       Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U.S. 157,\n\n170 (1986).     The district court's ruling rested on a factual\n\nevaluation of what had occurred and the application of a general\n\nstandard to the particular facts found. The district court's\n\nevaluation is reasonable, is reviewed with deference, United States\n\nv. Downs-Moses, 329 F.3d 253, 267 (1st Cir.), cert. denied sub nom.\n\nWard-O'Neill v. United States, 540 U.S. 916 (2003), and must be\n\nsustained here.\n\n          Milan also says that the redacting of his references to\n\nco-defendants unfairly exaggerated his own role.         Redaction is a\n\njudgment call, primarily within the discretion of the trial judge,\n\nUnited States v. Thuna, 786 F.2d 437, 441 n.7 (1st Cir.), cert.\n\ndenied, 479 U.S. 825 (1986), and the standard is not friendly to\n\nthe dissatisfied party.     United States v. Simonelli, 237 F.3d 19,\n\n28 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 821 (2001).           Other trial\n\ntestimony amply established the involvement of other defendants,\n\nand the redaction was not an abuse of discretion.\n\n          Nor did the court violate Milan's right to confront\n\nwitnesses against him when he was not allowed to question the\n\nagents   to   bring   out   his   own    admissions   implicating   other\n\ndefendants.   \"Since the deletion of the [redacted testimony] was\n\nnot prejudicial . . . it was within the district court's discretion\n\nto so limit cross-examination, and no independent sixth amendment\n\nissue is raised.\" Thuna, 786 F.2d at 442 n.10.           The agents, of\n\n\n                                  -16-\n\fcourse, had no first hand knowledge of the relevant events and\n\nMilan was himself free to testify first hand about the involvement\n\nof others if he chose.\n\n           Martinez says that the district court should have granted\n\nhis motions for acquittal and for a new trial.       Martinez says that\n\nbased on the evidence he was no more than a passenger on the yawl\n\nand did not participate in the smuggling venture.         On this claim,\n\nwe view the evidence in the government's favor and affirm the\n\nconviction if a rational jury could conclude that the prosecution\n\nproved all elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nUnited States v. Beltran, 503 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n           At trial, nine of the ten witnesses testified against\n\nMartinez, saying (for example) that he assisted with the navigation\n\nof the vessel and received payment from one of the passengers.          (In\n\nfact, Martinez was identified by many more but the judge limited\n\nwitness   testimony    as   cumulative.)   The   motion   to   acquit   was\n\nproperly denied and the denial of a new trial was not an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.\n\n           Hilario claims that the government tainted his conviction\n\nby intimating, in its closing statement, that Hilario refused to\n\nbring the yawl ashore because he had not yet confirmed that each\n\npassenger had a friend or family member waiting on land to pay the\n\ntrip organizers.      The prosecutor claimed \"that profit, that profit\n\nthat they were going to make off this trip was why defendant\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\fLeonardo Hilario-Hilario would not allow that yawl to come to land\n\nuntil contact was made with the people on land.\"\n\n            There was evidence that travelers were to be held ashore\n\nuntil    further   payments    were   made    and    that    Hilario   was   heard\n\ndiscussing the matter on a cellular telephone.                      Possibly the\n\nprosecutor's inference was a step beyond what was proved; but there\n\nwas no contemporaneous objection, meaning that review is for plain\n\nerror only.        United States v. Allen, 469 F.3d 11, 16 (1st Cir.\n\n2006), cert. denied, 128 S. Ct. 41 (2007).                 We have no reason to\n\nthink that this single comment altered the outcome.\n\n            This brings us to the defendants' attacks on their\n\nsentences. By far the most important is one advanced by Rodriguez,\n\nnamely, that his ten-year sentence exceeds the maximum allowed\n\nunder the statute; he asks that we remand his case to the district\n\ncourt for re-sentencing subject to a statutory maximum of only five\n\nyears.    Statutory context is required to grasp his argument.\n\n            The    governing    statute,      8     U.S.C.    §    1324,   defines\n\nprohibited conduct as, among other things, knowingly \"bring[ing] to\n\nor attempt[ing] to bring to the United States [an alien] at a place\n\nother than a designated port of entry,\" id. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(i), or\n\naiding and abetting the commission of prohibited acts, id. §\n\n1324(a)(1)(A)(v)(II).     Subsection (a)(1)(B) provides the pertinent\n\nmaximum    sentences,    which    vary       based    on     the    circumstances\n\nsurrounding the crime's commission.\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\f                Importantly, a defendant convicted of smuggling an alien\n\nis subject to a ten-year maximum, id. § 1324(a)(1)(B)(i), but--\n\nquite unusually--one convicted solely of aiding or abetting can be\n\nimprisoned for no more than five years, id. § 1324(a)(1)(B)(ii).2\n\nStiffer maximums are provided for jeopardizing the life of another\n\nor causing serious bodily injury (twenty-year maximum) or for\n\ncommitting        an       offense    resulting       in    death     (maximum      of   life\n\nimprisonment).             Id. §§ 1324(a)(1)(B)(iii), (iv).\n\n                The indictment (quoted above) charged the five defendants\n\nin   a       single    count     with     violating        section    1324(a)(1)(A)(i)'s\n\nprohibition           on   the   smuggling       of   aliens     as     well   as    section\n\n1324(a)(1)(A)(v)(II)'s aiding and abetting prohibition; it further\n\nalleged that the defendants had acted for purposes of financial\n\ngain and that the smuggling venture had jeopardized the lives of\n\nthe passengers, resulting in the death of seven of them, triggering\n\nenhanced penalties under sections 1324(a)(1)(B)(iii) and (iv).\n\n                The district court gave instructions to the jury covering\n\nboth smuggling and aiding and abetting that offense, and asked\n\nwhether each defendant was guilty or not guilty \"[a]s to count one\n\nof   the      indictment.\"           It   also   gave      the   jury    special     verdict\n\n\n         2\n      The ordinary rule, in the absence of such a distinction in\nthe substantive statute, is that an aider and abettor is treated as\na principal, 18 U.S.C. § 2, and is punishable accordingly. See\nUnited States v. Bryan, 483 F.2d 88, 95 (3d Cir. 1973) (\"[A]n aider\nand abettor is a principal and can be punished as such.\") (internal\nquotation omitted). Normally only an accessory after the fact gets\na fifty percent discount on the maximum sentence. 18 U.S.C. § 3.\n\n                                             -19-\n\fquestions directed to financial gain, jeopardizing the lives of\n\npassengers, and death; but, probably because such a distinction\n\nordinarily does not matter (see note 2, above), it did not ask the\n\njury to determine whether each defendant was guilty of smuggling or\n\nmerely aiding and abetting.\n\n           As to the defendants other than Rodriguez, this makes no\n\ndifference because the jury's special verdict determined that each\n\nhad jeopardized the lives of others and that death had resulted,\n\ntriggering imprisonment for \"any term of years or for life . . . .\"\n\nId. §§ 1324(a)(1)(B)(iii), (iv). But no such jury finding was made\n\nagainst Rodriguez; and, if only an aider and abettor, his maximum\n\nterm should be five years.    Compare id. § 1324(a)(1)(B)(i) with\n\n(ii).\n\n           Rodriguez did not raise this issue at sentencing but\n\nraises it now on appeal, so our review is only for plain error and\n\nwe may reverse only if we conclude that the error was plain and\n\nprejudicial, and (if uncorrected) would cause a miscarriage of\n\njustice.   United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 734 (1993).   Facts\n\nraising the statutory maximum penalty must be found by a jury,\n\nJones v. United States, 526 U.S. 227, 232 (1999), and here we\n\ncannot tell from the jury verdict that Rodriguez was convicted of\n\nsmuggling (rather than aiding and abetting).\n\n           So the ten-year sentence was error and prejudicial but\n\nwas it a miscarriage of justice?      Ordinarily, we will treat a\n\n\n                               -20-\n\fsentence that nakedly exceeds the statutory maximum as plain\n\nerror;3 but that assumes that the defendant could not lawfully have\n\nbeen given that sentence.      Here, Rodriguez could have been given\n\nthat sentence if the evidence allowed him to be convicted as a\n\nprincipal and the jury so found.           It might be enough to negate\n\nmiscarriage if the evidence were compelling and the jury likely so\n\nfound.    See United States v. Portes, 505 F.3d 21, 26 (1st Cir.),\n\ncert. denied, 128 S. Ct. 730 (2007).\n\n           The jury did have enough evidence to convict Rodriguez as\n\na principal.   Anyone who helped operate the ship could technically\n\nbe   treated   as   a   principal   and    there   was    testimony--albeit\n\ncontradicted by another witness--that Rodriguez helped pilot the\n\nvessel.     And (as we will see) the evidence would also have\n\npermitted the jury to conclude, as did the trial judge, that\n\nRodriguez brandished a knife; but again the evidence was mixed and\n\nthe jury may well not have viewed it as did the trial judge.\n\n           In all events Rodriguez was not in charge--the defendant\n\nmost like a captain was Hilario--and, in a group enterprise, a jury\n\ncould choose to regard someone whose role seemed to it less\n\nculpable as merely an aider and abettor.                 Here, for whatever\n\n\n     3\n      E.g., United States v. Rodriguez,        F.3d    , 2008 WL\n2025066, at *19 (1st Cir. 2008); United States v. Rodriguez, 938\nF.2d 319, 322 n.4 (1st Cir. 1991).      Compare United States v.\nPortes, 505 F.3d 21, 26 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 128 S. Ct. 730\n(2007) (increase of a statutory maximum based on drug quantity\nissue not submitted to the jury not reversible for plain error\nwhere evidence of drug quantity was overwhelming).\n\n                                    -21-\n\freason, the jury assigned Rodriguez a lesser role than the other\n\ndefendants since it found him alone not responsible for endangering\n\nthe passengers or culpable for the deaths.       So we have no reason to\n\nthink it convicted him of the substantive offense of smuggling.\n\n           The government, which could have asked for a special\n\nverdict to establish that each defendant was a smuggler and not\n\nmerely an aider and abettor, simply says that the evidence was\n\nsufficient for the former designation. This does not show that the\n\njury convicted Rodriguez as a smuggler, or inevitably would have\n\nconvicted him on this basis if it had been asked to choose.           Nor\n\ndoes the government offer any alternative to Rodriguez' proposed\n\nremedy, namely, a remand for re-sentencing him within the five-year\n\nmaximum.\n\n           The government does not argue that the district judge\n\ncould now substitute his own determination for one that the Supreme\n\nCourt has said must be made by the jury.     Jones, 526 U.S. at 251-\n\n52.   Nor, given double jeopardy principles, is it clear that the\n\npenalty issue could now be re-submitted to a new jury.          But see\n\nUnited States v. Williams, 449 F.3d 635, 646 (5th Cir. 2006).\n\nAbsent   any   alternative   suggestion   from    the   government,   the\n\nstraightforward course is to remand for re-sentencing Rodriguez\n\nwithin the statutory maximum of five years in prison.\n\n           In computing Rodriguez' guideline range, the district\n\njudge imposed on him a four-level upward adjustment for brandishing\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\fa dangerous weapon.      U.S.S.G. § 2L1.1(a)(4)(B) (2004).          Rodriguez\n\nclaims that he used what he calls a \"kitchen knife,\" and the\n\ngovernment calls a machete, merely to cut salami to distribute to\n\nthe passengers during the trip.       But the district court found that\n\nthe knife was brandished and there is evidence to support this\n\nview.\n\n             One witness claimed that Rodriguez first used the knife\n\nonly    to   cut   salami,   but   later    wielded   the   knife   during   a\n\nconfrontation, telling passengers to \"get down if you don't want us\n\nto cut your neck;\" a second said that Rodriguez \"pressured\" the\n\npassengers to remain calm by \"carrying a machete in his hand\" in an\n\naggressive manner.      A third witness said that Rodriguez used the\n\nknife only to cut salami--but conceded that \"there was one time he\n\nwas speaking to the people telling them to relax with that knife in\n\nhis hands.\"\n\n             The conduct described by the first two witnesses amounts\n\nto \"brandishing\" under the definition that \"all or part of the\n\nweapon was displayed, or the presence of the weapon was otherwise\n\nmade known to another person, in order to intimidate that person,\"\n\nU.S.S.G. § 1B1.1, cmt. n.1(c); see United States v. LaFortune, 192\n\nF.3d 157, 161-62 (1st Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1129\n\n(2000).      To overturn the finding would require a showing of clear\n\nerror by the sentencing judge, United States v. Thongsophaporn, 503\n\n\n\n\n                                     -23-\n\fF.3d 51, 57-58 (1st Cir. 2007), cert. denied, 128 S. Ct. 1294\n\n(2008), so we sustain the adjustment as to Rodriguez.\n\n            This may not matter as to Rodriguez given the five-year\n\nmaximum.     But it does matter to the other defendants to whom\n\nRodriguez' use of the knife was attributed based on guideline rules\n\napplicable    to    \"jointly    undertaken        criminal   activity\"      that     is\n\n\"reasonably      foreseeable\"         to     other    actors.            U.S.S.G.     §\n\n1B1.3(a)(1)(B).      That the group was engaged in \"jointly undertaken\n\ncriminal activity\" is obvious; the harder question is whether the\n\nuse   of   the     knife   in   aid    of     the    endeavor      was   \"reasonably\n\nforeseeable\" to the other defendants.\n\n            The defendants say that the knife was brought on board\n\ninnocently and that smuggling of illegal aliens does not normally\n\ninvolve coercion or violence.               But the knife was still a weapon\n\nand, in this operation, the passengers were not to be released\n\nuntil additional sums were paid to the organizers upon their\n\narrival--resistance being a real possibility in such a situation.\n\nUnder these circumstances we cannot say that it was clear error to\n\nfind that misuse of the knife was reasonably foreseeable.                           See\n\nUnited States v. Santiago, 2006 WL 2946882, at *4 (11th Cir. 2006)\n\n(unpublished decision).\n\n            Hilario    argues    for       himself   that    the    district   court\n\nimproperly applied a three-level increase to his offense level\n\nbased on his role as a \"manager or supervisor\" of the smuggling\n\n\n                                           -24-\n\foperation.   Such   an   enhancement    is   appropriate   \"if   there   is\n\nevidence that a defendant, in committing the crime, exercised\n\ncontrol over, or was otherwise responsible for overseeing the\n\nactivities of, at least one other person.\"             United States v.\n\nVoccola, 99 F.3d 37, 44 (1st Cir. 1996) (quoting United States v.\n\nSavoie, 985 F.2d 612, 616 (1st Cir. 1993)).\n\n          Hilario   used   a   cellular      phone   and   was   overheard\n\ndiscussing logistics of the operation with another participant; he\n\nwas also identified as the captain who gave instructions to other\n\nparticipants and determined whether and when the boat would be\n\nbrought to shore.   The district court was entitled to impose the\n\nupward adjustment based on this evidence.4\n\n          The same is not so easily said about the two-level\n\n\"special skill\" adjustment imposed on all defendants save Hilario.\n\nU.S.S.G. § 3B1.3 (permitting for an adjustment where the defendant\n\n\"used a special skill[] in a manner that significantly facilitated\n\nthe commission or concealment of the offense\"). Peguero, Milan and\n\nRodriguez dispute the district court's conclusion that each of them\n\npossessed a special skill within the meaning of the guidelines. We\n\nreview this claim more closely, United States v. Noah, 130 F.3d\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      Hilario's argument that other defendants--namely, Martinez\nand Milan--were the true managers of the affair is beside the\npoint, since the managerial role enhancement does not require the\ndefendant to \"be at the top of a criminal scheme.\" United States v.\nGoldberg, 105 F.3d 770, 777 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n                                 -25-\n\f490, 499 (1st Cir. 1997), because it turns less on fact finding and\n\nmore on what the guideline means by \"special skill.\"\n\n           The guidelines define a special skill as \"a skill not\n\npossessed by members of the general public and usually requiring\n\nsubstantial education, training or licensing.\"           U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3,\n\ncmt. n.3 (providing as examples the skills possessed by \"pilots,\n\nlawyers, doctors, accountants, chemists, and demolition experts\").\n\nThe government argued at sentencing \"that to pilot a vessel . . .\n\non rough seas, high waves, traveling for at least 30 hours from the\n\nDominican Republic towards Puerto Rico\" necessarily demonstrated\n\nuse of a special skill.\n\n           The district court did not specify its basis for pinning\n\nthe label to the four defendants.              No one other than Martinez\n\n(who, perhaps wisely, does not contest the adjustment as applied to\n\nhim) was observed using a GPS or any other navigational device\n\nrequiring some degree of sophisticated knowledge. So far as we can\n\ndetermine from the evidence, the others who received the adjustment\n\nmerely took the helm at points during the voyage.           The vessel, as\n\nthe government pointed out, had none of the standard navigation or\n\nsafety equipment that would ordinarily be used for a lengthy sea\n\nvoyage.\n\n           Captaining a vessel fully equipped for the high seas\n\ndoubtless requires special skills, see United States v. Montero-\n\nMontero,   370   F.3d   121,   123-24   (1st    Cir.   2004),   and   certain\n\n\n                                   -26-\n\fseafaring     skills   would   doubtless   qualify   (e.g.,   navigation,\n\ncommunications, engineering). But steering a simple sailing vessel\n\nalong a course, as directed by another, does not appear to us to be\n\na special skill and the district judge did not say that the three\n\ndefendants did any more than this or had the training or expertise\n\nto do more.\n\n            Rodriguez is described in the pre-sentence report as a\n\n\"lifetime construction worker\" with \"no other employment history\";\n\nPeguero, as a construction worker and a farm worker (the government\n\nconceded that Peguero was not \"trained in any matters of the sea\").\n\nMilan's pre-sentence report alone contains a reference to his\n\nbackground as a fisherman in the Dominican Republic but this bare\n\nstatement could cover anything from a rowboat to serious sailing;\n\nand some of what he did seemingly involved capturing small crabs at\n\nthe beach.\n\n             The government points to no evidence that Rodriguez or\n\nPeguero had any sailing or navigational experience or that Milan,\n\neven if he had specialized experience, used it here.          Although the\n\nterm \"yawl\" was used at trial, the vessel used here appears to have\n\nbeen little more than a wooden hull with two outboard motors\n\naffixed.    The level of skill required to steer such a vessel under\n\nthe direction of a man with a GPS can hardly be compared even to\n\nthat needed to keep a sailboat on course.            On this record the\n\nspecial skills adjustment cannot stand, accord United States v.\n\n\n                                   -27-\n\fBatista De La Cruz, 460 F.3d 466, 469 (3d Cir. 2006), and new\n\nsentences are required with the adjustment deleted.\n\n           Our decision has addressed the defendants' colorable\n\nclaims;   other    claims   have   been   considered    but    require   no\n\ndiscussion.     We commend the skillful work of the district judge in\n\nthis complicated trial; given the number of defendants and the\n\nvariety of issues presented, it is a credit to him that there\n\nremain only a few loose ends as to three sentences that can be\n\nreadily resolved on remand.\n\n           The convictions of all five defendants are affirmed, as\n\nare the sentences imposed on Hilario and Martinez.            The sentences\n\nof the other three defendants (Rodriguez, Milan and Peguero) are\n\nvacated   and    their   cases   are   remanded   for   re-sentencing    in\n\naccordance with this decision.\n\n           It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -28-\n\f",

The U.S. Coast Guard and Puerto Rico authorities brought eighty-five of the passengers safely to shore; seven others were confirmed dead at the scene.</p>\n<p>Based on identifications made by some of the passengers on the beach, five individualsLeonardo Hilario-Hilario (\"Hilario\"), Kennedi Martinez (\"Martinez\"), Fernando Jose Milan (\"Milan\"), Delgadino Peguero (\"Peguero\"), and Santiago Rodriguez (\"Rodriguez\")were separated out as those who had conducted the smuggling venture. Although generally referred to by the government as \"captains,\" Hilario turned out to be the man in charge and the others, although sometimes involved in piloting, were crew.</p>\n<p>After further investigation, all five defendants were charged on May 17, 2005, in a second superseding indictment, alleging that</p>\n<blockquote>aiding and abetting each other, [they] did, knowingly, willfully and intentionally, bring and attempt to bring to the United States, for private financial gain and profit, and by the use of an unseaworthy and overcrowded yawl which placed in jeopardy the lives of the aliens, approximately eighty-seven (87) aliens. . . . This violation resulted in the death of [seven passengers].</blockquote>\n<p>Fairly read, this formulation, although jumbled, charged each defendant with both the central offense of smuggling an alien into the United States or attempting to do so, 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(i) (2000), and the separately enumerated offense of aiding and abetting such an offense, <i>id.</i> § 1324(a)(1)(A)(v)(II). One who aids and abets is normally liable as a principal, 18 U.S.C. § 2 (2000), but the smuggling statute prescribes in certain cases a lower sentence for mere aiders and abettors. 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p>The references in the indictment to financial gain, placing life in jeopardy or committing an offense resulting in death invoked provisions of the statute's sentencing regime. Each one of these characteristics raises the maximum sentence available. 8 U.S.C. §§ 1324(a)(1)(B)(i), (iii), (iv). Although pertinent only to sentencing, a jury determination typically is required to invoke the higher sentences under familiar precedent. <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p>A fifteen-day jury trial followed at which ten of the passengers testified. The government relied heavily on eyewitness testimony to establish that the five defendants operated the vessel. Several passengers testified that Milan, Peguero, and Rodriguez piloted the yawl at various points during the journey; Martinez was identified as having navigated and steered the vessel with the help of a GPS or similar device, and Hilario was described as the \"head captain\" who gave orders to the others and maintained contact via cellular telephone with other organizers on land.</p>\n<p>The government also presented evidence to show the unseaworthiness of the vessel. The passengers described the overcrowded, unsafe, and unsanitary conditions on the vessel. Three members of the Coast Guard, who had participated in the rescue <span class=\"star-pagination\">*70</span> efforts, described the conditions of the surf, the rudimentary construction of the yawl (which had fallen apart in the surf along the Vega Alta coast), and the vessel's lack of bathrooms, lights, seats, radio, or appropriate safety or navigational equipment.</p>\n<p>All five defendants were convicted on the indictment count set forth above.<sup>[1]</sup> Pursuant to a special verdict, the jury found that all defendants acted for the purpose of financial gain, and all except Rodriguez placed the lives of the passengers in jeopardy and had participated in an offense resulting in the death of seven passengers. The district court later sentenced Hilario to 204 months in prison, Martinez and Peguero to 188 months, Milan to 176 months, and Rodriguez to 120 months.</p>\n<p>All five now appeal their convictions and sentences, arguing that various decisions made by the district judge deprived them of a fair trial and that their sentences were improper. Some of these arguments are pressed by all five defendants while others are unique to particular defendants. We begin with the collective attacks and then turn to the individual ones. The standard of review varies with the issue.</p>\n<p>All five defendants argue that pretrial identification, by means of the photograph line-up shown to the cooperating witnesses, was so suggestive that it fatally tainted the identification evidence at trial. The completed photo line-up contained fifty-eight color head shots of those taken from the waters alive, including all of the men; some of the women were included but others were left out after one of the prosecutors said that it was unnecessary to include the women.</p>\n<p>The fifty-eight photographs were arranged nine per-page (leaving four for the last page) in the order in which the subjects were processed by immigration officials. Since the five defendants had been separated from the remaining detainees, they were photographed last and appear in the final five photographs in the set. This was shown to the passengers who were willing to identify the \"captains.\" Thirty-seven passengers identified Hilario, forty identified Rodriguez, thirty-five identified Milan, twenty-seven identified Martinez, and nineteen identified Peguero.</p>\n<p>At trial, the defendants sought to have the photo line-up suppressed and to prohibit in-court identification of the defendants as tainted. The district court denied the motion and the government introduced the line-up and relied heavily at trial on in-court identification by the testifying passengers. Our review of the district court's denial of the motion to suppress the photo identification is plenary save that findings of fact are reviewed for clear error. <i>United States v. Holliday,</i> 457 F.3d 121, 125 (1st Cir.2006), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 1317, 167 L.Ed.2d 127 (2007).</p>\n<p>The defendants contend that the introduction of this identification evidence undermined their right to a fair trial. <i>See </i><i>Stovall v. Denno,</i> 388 U.S. 293, 301-02, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199 (1967). Of all their attacks on this piece of evidence, the strongest is that the defendants' pictures were grouped together as the last five shown; and four of the defendants appear in the only pictures on the final page of the line-up. Other criticisms can be dealt with more briefly.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court says that a court should first look to the procedure <span class=\"star-pagination\">*71</span> itself to determine whether it was impermissibly suggestive, <i>United States v. Bouthot,</i> 878 F.2d 1506, 1514 (1st Cir.1989) (citing <i>Simmons v. United States,</i> 390 U.S. 377, 384, 88 S.Ct. 967, 19 L.Ed.2d 1247 (1968)); if so, the court determines whether under the totality of the circumstances the suggestiveness is so pronounced that there is a serious likelihood of irreparable misidentification. <i>Neil v. Biggers,</i> 409 U.S. 188, 196-97, 93 S.Ct. 375, 34 L.Ed.2d 401 (1972).</p>\n<p>Suggestiveness is a matter of degree. In principle, a grouping of the defendants together might suggest an association among them; if one were recognized as culpable, this might heighten the chance that ones next to him might be so identified even if the witness were doubtful. Location at the end seems no more dangerous than at the beginning, and the grouping does not appear to be deliberate tampering; but we will assume, merely <i>arguendo,</i> that the line-up was suggestive.</p>\n<p>Yet the risk of prejudice was minimal. This is not a case in which a marginal identification<i>e.g.,</i> by a witness who only glimpsed the perpetrator of a crimemay have been bolstered by suggestive identification procedures. <i>See id.</i> at 199-200, 93 S.Ct. 375. Here, the witnesses identifying the defendants had traveled with them for thirty hours at a close distance and without any attempt by any of the defendants to conceal their appearances during the trip.</p>\n<p>Further, the photo array was shown to the passengers on the same day as their arrival in Puerto Rico while their memories of the trip were still fresh. And defense counsel were given ample time at trial to explore any defects in the identification procedureincluding whether other individuals not pictured in the photo array were the true leaders of the smuggling ventureand to argue those defects to the jury in summation. The photo array did not create a serious risk of misidentification.</p>\n<p>As for the other criticisms, we are unable to discern the \"marked differences in skin color, clothing, and contrast of coloring\" that defendants claim rendered the line-up suggestive. While some of the photographs, as the district court pointed out, do \"look more like mug shots,\" none of these depicts any of the defendants. Nor were the latter identifications tainted when the government at the beachbased on passenger identificationconspicuously separated the defendants from the other passengers.</p>\n<p>The defendants also object to the admission of certain testimony given by two Coast Guard officers involved in the rescue, Lieutenants Lahcen Armstrong and William Nunes. Armstrong testified extensively about the size and appearance of the yawl, the number of passengers, and sea conditions at the time. Over objection he was allowed to testify about what safety equipment such a vessel should have had (but here didn't) and the maximum number of passengers that could safely be carried.</p>\n<p>Specifically, Armstrong said that such a vessel required \"properly maintained engines. . . navigational lights and equipment. . . life preservers, for all the people on board, navigational charts and potentially GPS electronic devices, [and] VHS/FM radios\" and that he \"would expect a vessel that size to have no more than 20 to 30 people on board safely.\" Nunes stated that a vessel the size of the yawl could not sustain the swells and rough surf it encountered.</p>\n<p>The objection, duly preserved, is that neither officer was specified as an expert in advance of trial, as is required by governing rules. Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(a)(1)(G). <span class=\"star-pagination\">*72</span> The government argues that no notice was required because the lieutenants delivered only lay opinion testimony, which is not subject to Rule 16's disclosure requirements. The recurring problem is that \"the same witnessfor example, a law enforcement officermay be qualified to `provide both lay and expert testimony in a single case.'\" <i>United States v. Ayala-Pizarro,</i> 407 F.3d 25, 28 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 546 U.S. 902, 126 S.Ct. 247, 163 L.Ed.2d 226 (2005) (quoting Fed.R.Evid. 701, advisory committee's note).</p>\n<p>There is no bright-line rule to separate lay opinion from expert witness testimony; circuits, and indeed decisions within a circuit, are often in some tension. But we think it is quite arguable, and proceed on that <i>arguendo</i> premise, that some of Armstrong's testimony as to specific necessary safety precautions and vessel capacity seems to be based on specialized knowledge and also to reflect the heightened sophistication normally associated with expert testimony.</p>\n<p>But \"[t]o succeed in obtaining a reversal on appeal, a defendant must prove both an abuse of discretion and prejudice.\" <i>United States v. Alvarez,</i> 987 F.2d 77, 85 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 510 U.S. 849, 114 S.Ct. 147, 126 L.Ed.2d 109 (1993). Given the lack of any safety or fixed navigation equipment and the extraordinary overcrowding, the vessel was patently dangerous to life. Indeed, defense counsel objected to the introduction of testimony from other Coast Guard officers on the ground that it was \"irrelevant or cumulative\" because \"there [was] no issue that there were unsafe conditions on the boat.\"</p>\n<p>The defendants do not complain that the witnesses were not formally qualified as experts, presumably because their qualifications were apparent. This does not automatically mitigate a Rule 16 violation if one occurred; the rule helps the opponent to develop cross examination and to retain a counter-expert. But on the present facts, the witnesses were quite unlikely to be impeached on their main points and defendants knew at the outset that unseaworthiness was a critical issue.</p>\n<p>The defendants further assert that they are entitled to a new trial because the jury selection process did not adequately probe jurors' prejudices. They say that the district court erred in refusing to ask eighty proposed voir dire questions designed to uncover, among other things, potential jurors' biases concerning illegal immigrants, immigration in general, individuals hailing from the Dominican Republic, and prior exposure to the case through the media.</p>\n<p>While the trial judge did not ask the precise questions requested, he conducted a thorough and searching voir dire, covering <i>inter alia</i> whether the jurors had pre-existing views of the defendants' guilt or innocence; whether they had learned anything about the case through any media; whether any jurors would be prejudiced by evidence of the seven deaths; and, importantly, whether the jurors had feelings about Dominican nationals or illegal immigrants that would impair the ability to come to a fair, impartial, and just decision.</p>\n<p>Nor did the district court err, as the defendants now argue, by failing to question all members of the venire individually. Individual questioning may sometimes be appropriate, but this decision, like most in the conduct of the voir dire, rests in the district court's sound judgment. <i>United States v. Orlando-Figueroa,</i> 229 F.3d 33, 43 (1st Cir.2000). Defendants are also far from showing that they were prejudiced by the district court's handling of the venire. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Misla-Aldarondo,</i> 478 F.3d 52, 60-61 (1st Cir.), <span class=\"star-pagination\">*73</span> <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 132, 169 L.Ed.2d 91 (2007).</p>\n<p>Next, defendants assail the district court's refusal to enjoin the government from speaking to the press. At trial, Martinez and Hilario filed separate motions seeking a court order to enjoin the prosecution from making further statements to the press; both motions referred to an article published by the San Juan Star on May 9, 2005, in which the government confirmed the date of the upcoming trial and the penalties the government was seeking.</p>\n<p>In subsequent motions the parties disputed whether other statements in the articleincluding the claim that \"dozens of survivors identified the accused as the organizers of the ill-fated crossing\"were properly attributed to the government in violation of local rules prohibiting prosecutors from publicly commenting on the evidence presented at trial. We found no recorded ruling by the court; conceivably, the matter was dealt with in chambers or simply dropped.</p>\n<p>In all events, while defendants refer to the \"unprecedented media coverage\" following the rescue and call the publicity \"inflammatory,\" they do not show that the government was responsible for anything beyond a description of the trial date and penalties sought. Under these circumstances, we see no basis for saying that the failure to issue the requested injunction resulted in harmful publicity or otherwise prejudiced the defendants.</p>\n<p>We turn now to the objections made by individual defendants, starting with Milan's claim that his fifth and sixth amendment rights were violated by the admission of statements he made to federal agents who interrogated him after his arrest. Milan was interviewed after his arrest by federal agents in the early morning hours of December 4, 2004, and again interrogated by two agents and two prosecutors on the afternoon of December 5, 2004. In each case he was given <i>Miranda</i> warnings and signed waiver forms.</p>\n<p>During these interviews, Milan admitted to being involved in the smuggling venture and confirmed that he had, at times, piloted the vessel. He gave other details about the trip and identified from a photo spread the pictures of the other individuals involved and specified those who had controlled the engines. At trial, the district judge allowed the statements to be used against Milan, redacting references to other defendants to comply with <i>Bruton v. United States,</i> 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968). <i>See </i><i>Richardson v. Marsh,</i> 481 U.S. 200, 211, 107 S.Ct. 1702, 95 L.Ed.2d 176 (1987).</p>\n<p>Milan says that the second interrogation occurred after a criminal complaint and an arrest warrant had been filed on December 4, 2004, so it was improper not only under <i>Miranda</i> but because the questioning occurred in the absence of counsel after adversarial proceedings had commenced. But whether or not a criminal complaint begins adversarial proceedings triggering a right to counsel, <i>cf. </i><i>Brewer v. Williams,</i> 430 U.S. 387, 97 S.Ct. 1232, 51 L.Ed.2d 424 (1977), a defendant can still waive that right. <i>Patterson v. Illinois,</i> 487 U.S. 285, 290-91, 108 S.Ct. 2389, 101 L.Ed.2d 261 (1988).</p>\n<p>As for Milan's claim that both interviews were unlawful because his <i>Miranda</i> waivers were not knowing and intelligent, the district judge held a hearing, heard from three of the agents, and considered a proffer from Milan. Milan cited his limited education, experience with police in his own country and the trauma of the boat foundering; the agents described Milan's calm demeanor, lack of handcuffing and the agents' conduct during the interviews. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*74</span> The judge concluded that the waivers were valid.</p>\n<p>\"The voluntariness of a waiver . . . has always depended on the absence of police overreaching, not on `free choice' in any broader sense of the word.\" <i>Colorado v. Connelly,</i> 479 U.S. 157, 170, 107 S.Ct. 515, 93 L.Ed.2d 473 (1986). The district court's ruling rested on a factual evaluation of what had occurred and the application of a general standard to the particular facts found. The district court's evaluation is reasonable, is reviewed with deference, <i>United States v. Downs-Moses,</i> 329 F.3d 253, 267 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied sub nom. </i><i>Ward-O'Neill v. United States,</i> 540 U.S. 916, 124 S.Ct. 305, 157 L.Ed.2d 210 (2003), and must be sustained here.</p>\n<p>Milan also says that the redacting of his references to co-defendants unfairly exaggerated his own role. Redaction is a judgment call, primarily within the discretion of the trial judge, <i>United States v. Thuna,</i> 786 F.2d 437, 441 n. 7 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 479 U.S. 825, 107 S.Ct. 100, 93 L.Ed.2d 50 (1986), and the standard is not friendly to the dissatisfied party. <i>United States v. Simonelli,</i> 237 F.3d 19, 28 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 534 U.S. 821, 122 S.Ct. 54, 151 L.Ed.2d 23 (2001). Other trial testimony amply established the involvement of other defendants, and the redaction was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p>Nor did the court violate Milan's right to confront witnesses against him when he was not allowed to question the agents to bring out his own admissions implicating other defendants. \"Since the deletion of the [redacted testimony] was not prejudicial . . . it was within the district court's discretion to so limit cross-examination, and no independent sixth amendment issue is raised.\" <i>Thuna,</i> 786 F.2d at 442 n. 10. The agents, of course, had no first hand knowledge of the relevant events and Milan was himself free to testify first hand about the involvement of others if he chose.</p>\n<p>Martinez says that the district court should have granted his motions for acquittal and for a new trial. Martinez says that based on the evidence he was no more than a passenger on the yawl and did not participate in the smuggling venture. On this claim, we view the evidence in the government's favor and affirm the conviction if a rational jury could conclude that the prosecution proved all elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>United States v. Beltran,</i> 503 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>At trial, nine of the ten witnesses testified against Martinez, saying (for example) that he assisted with the navigation of the vessel and received payment from one of the passengers. (In fact, Martinez was identified by many more but the judge limited witness testimony as cumulative.) The motion to acquit was properly denied and the denial of a new trial was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p>Hilario claims that the government tainted his conviction by intimating, in its closing statement, that Hilario refused to bring the yawl ashore because he had not yet confirmed that each passenger had a friend or family member waiting on land to pay the trip organizers. The prosecutor claimed \"that profit, that profit that they were going to make off this trip was why defendant Leonardo Hilario-Hilario would not allow that yawl to come to land until contact was made with the people on land.\"</p>\n<p>There was evidence that travelers were to be held ashore until further payments were made and that Hilario was heard discussing the matter on a cellular telephone. Possibly the prosecutor's inference was a step beyond what was proved; but <span class=\"star-pagination\">*75</span> there was no contemporaneous objection, meaning that review is for plain error only. <i>United States v. Allen,</i> 469 F.3d 11, 16 (1st Cir.2006), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 41, 169 L.Ed.2d 40 (2007). We have no reason to think that this single comment altered the outcome.</p>\n<p>This brings us to the defendants' attacks on their sentences. By far the most important is one advanced by Rodriguez, namely, that his ten-year sentence exceeds the maximum allowed under the statute; he asks that we remand his case to the district court for re-sentencing subject to a statutory maximum of only five years. Statutory context is required to grasp his argument.</p>\n<p>The governing statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1324, defines prohibited conduct as, among other things, knowingly \"bring[ing] to or attempt[ing] to bring to the United States [an alien] at a place other than a designated port of entry,\" <i>id.</i> § 1324(a)(1)(A)(i), or aiding and abetting the commission of prohibited acts, <i>id.</i> § 1324(a)(1)(A)(v)(II). Subsection (a)(1)(B) provides the pertinent maximum sentences, which vary based on the circumstances surrounding the crime's commission.</p>\n<p>Importantly, a defendant convicted of smuggling an alien is subject to a ten-year maximum, <i>id.</i> § 1324(a)(1)(B)(i), but quite unusuallyone convicted solely of aiding or abetting can be imprisoned for no more than five years, <i>id.</i> § 1324(a)(1)(B)(ii).<sup>[2]</sup> Stiffer maximums are provided for jeopardizing the life of another or causing serious bodily injury (twenty-year maximum) or for committing an offense resulting in death (maximum of life imprisonment). <i>Id.</i> §§ 1324(a)(1)(B)(iii), (iv).</p>\n<p>The indictment (quoted above) charged the five defendants in a single count with violating section 1324(a)(1)(A)(i)'s prohibition on the smuggling of aliens as well as section 1324(a)(1)(A)(v)(II)'s aiding and abetting prohibition; it further alleged that the defendants had acted for purposes of financial gain and that the smuggling venture had jeopardized the lives of the passengers, resulting in the death of seven of them, triggering enhanced penalties under sections 1324(a)(1)(B)(iii) and (iv).</p>\n<p>The district court gave instructions to the jury covering both smuggling and aiding and abetting that offense, and asked whether each defendant was guilty or not guilty \"[a]s to count one of the indictment.\" It also gave the jury special verdict questions directed to financial gain, jeopardizing the lives of passengers, and death; but, probably because such a distinction ordinarily does not matter (see note 2, above), it did not ask the jury to determine whether each defendant was guilty of smuggling or merely aiding and abetting.</p>\n<p>As to the defendants other than Rodriguez, this makes no difference because the jury's special verdict determined that each had jeopardized the lives of others and that death had resulted, triggering imprisonment for \"any term of years or for life. . . .\" <i>Id.</i> §§ 1324(a)(1)(B)(iii), (iv). But no such jury finding was made against Rodriguez; and, if only an aider and abettor, his maximum term should be five years. <i>Compare id.</i> § 1324(a)(1)(B)(i) <i>with</i> (ii).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*76</span> Rodriguez did not raise this issue at sentencing but raises it now on appeal, so our review is only for plain error and we may reverse only if we conclude that the error was plain and prejudicial, and (if uncorrected) would cause a miscarriage of justice. <i>United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Facts raising the statutory maximum penalty must be found by a jury, <i>Jones v. United States,</i> 526 U.S. 227, 232, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999), and here we cannot tell from the jury verdict that Rodriguez was convicted of smuggling (rather than aiding and abetting).</p>\n<p>So the ten-year sentence was error and prejudicial but was it a miscarriage of justice? Ordinarily, we will treat a sentence that nakedly exceeds the statutory maximum as plain error;<sup>[3]</sup> but that assumes that the defendant could not lawfully have been given that sentence. Here, Rodriguez could have been given that sentence if the evidence allowed him to be convicted as a principal and the jury so found. It might be enough to negate miscarriage if the evidence were compelling and the jury likely so found. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Portes,</i> 505 F.3d 21, 26 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 730, 169 L.Ed.2d 570 (2007).</p>\n<p>The jury did have enough evidence to convict Rodriguez as a principal. Anyone who helped operate the ship could technically be treated as a principal and there was testimonyalbeit contradicted by another witnessthat Rodriguez helped pilot the vessel. And (as we will see) the evidence would also have permitted the jury to conclude, as did the trial judge, that Rodriguez brandished a knife; but again the evidence was mixed and the jury may well not have viewed it as did the trial judge.</p>\n<p>In all events Rodriguez was not in chargethe defendant most like a captain was Hilarioand, in a group enterprise, a jury could choose to regard someone whose role seemed to it less culpable as merely an aider and abettor. Here, for whatever reason, the jury assigned Rodriguez a lesser role than the other defendants since it found him alone not responsible for endangering the passengers or culpable for the deaths. So we have no reason to think it convicted him of the substantive offense of smuggling.</p>\n<p>The government, which could have asked for a special verdict to establish that each defendant was a smuggler and not merely an aider and abettor, simply says that the evidence was sufficient for the former designation. This does not show that the jury convicted Rodriguez as a smuggler, or inevitably would have convicted him on this basis if it had been asked to choose. Nor does the government offer any alternative to Rodriguez' proposed remedy, namely, a remand for re-sentencing him within the five-year maximum.</p>\n<p>The government does not argue that the district judge could now substitute his own determination for one that the Supreme Court has said must be made by the jury. <i>Jones,</i> 526 U.S. at 251-52, 119 S.Ct. 1215. Nor, given double jeopardy principles, is it clear that the penalty issue could now be re-submitted to a new jury. <i>But see </i><i>United States v. Williams,</i> 449 F.3d 635, 646 (5th Cir.2006). Absent any alternative <span class=\"star-pagination\">*77</span> suggestion from the government, the straightforward course is to remand for resentencing Rodriguez within the statutory maximum of five years in prison.</p>\n<p>In computing Rodriguez' guideline range, the district judge imposed on him a four-level upward adjustment for brandishing a dangerous weapon. U.S.S.G. § 2L1.1(b)(4)(B) (2004). Rodriguez claims that he used what he calls a \"kitchen knife,\" and the government calls a machete, merely to cut salami to distribute to the passengers during the trip. But the district court found that the knife was brandished and there is evidence to support this view.</p>\n<p>One witness claimed that Rodriguez first used the knife only to cut salami, but later wielded the knife during a confrontation, telling passengers to \"get down if you don't want us to cut your neck;\" a second said that Rodriguez \"pressured\" the passengers to remain calm by \"carrying a machete in his hand\" in an aggressive manner. A third witness said that Rodriguez used the knife only to cut salami but conceded that \"there was one time he was speaking to the people telling them to relax with that knife in his hands.\"</p>\n<p>The conduct described by the first two witnesses amounts to \"brandishing\" under the definition that \"all or part of the weapon was displayed, or the presence of the weapon was otherwise made known to another person, in order to intimidate that person,\" U.S.S.G. § 1B1.1, cmt. n. 1(c); <i>see </i><i>United States v. LaFortune,</i> 192 F.3d 157, 161-62 (1st Cir.1999), <i>cert. denied,</i> 528 U.S. 1129, 120 S.Ct. 966, 145 L.Ed.2d 837 (2000). To overturn the finding would require a showing of clear error by the sentencing judge, <i>United States v. Thongsophaporn,</i> 503 F.3d 51, 57-58 (1st Cir.2007), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 1294, 170 L.Ed.2d 117 (2008), so we sustain the adjustment as to Rodriguez.</p>\n<p>This may not matter as to Rodriguez given the five-year maximum. But it does matter to the other defendants to whom Rodriguez' use of the knife was attributed based on guideline rules applicable to \"jointly undertaken criminal activity\" that is \"reasonably foreseeable\" to other actors. U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3(a)(1)(B). That the group was engaged in \"jointly undertaken criminal activity\" is obvious; the harder question is whether the use of the knife in aid of the endeavor was \"reasonably foreseeable\" to the other defendants.</p>\n<p>The defendants say that the knife was brought on board innocently and that smuggling of illegal aliens does not normally involve coercion or violence. But the knife was still a weapon and, in this operation, the passengers were not to be released until additional sums were paid to the organizers upon their arrivalresistance being a real possibility in such a situation. Under these circumstances we cannot say that it was clear error to find that misuse of the knife was reasonably foreseeable. <i>See United States v. Santiago,</i> 200 Fed.Appx. 928, 934-35 (11th Cir. 2006) (unpublished decision).</p>\n<p>Hilario argues for himself that the district court improperly applied a three-level increase to his offense level based on his role as a \"manager or supervisor\" of the smuggling operation. Such an enhancement is appropriate \"if there is evidence that a defendant, in committing the crime, exercised control over, or was otherwise responsible for overseeing the activities of, at least one other person.\" <i>United States v. Voccola,</i> 99 F.3d 37, 44 (1st Cir.1996) (quoting <i>United States v. Savoie,</i> 985 F.2d 612, 616 (1st Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p>Hilario used a cellular phone and was overheard discussing logistics of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*78</span> operation with another participant; he was also identified as the captain who gave instructions to other participants and determined whether and when the boat would be brought to shore. The district court was entitled to impose the upward adjustment based on this evidence.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>The same is not so easily said about the two-level \"special skill\" adjustment imposed on all defendants save Hilario. U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3 (permitting for an adjustment where the defendant \"used a special skill[] in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense\"). Peguero, Milan and Rodriguez dispute the district court's conclusion that each of them possessed a special skill within the meaning of the guidelines. We review this claim more closely, <i>United States v. Noah,</i> 130 F.3d 490, 499 (1st Cir.1997), because it turns less on fact finding and more on what the guideline means by \"special skill.\"</p>\n<p>The guidelines define a special skill as \"a skill not possessed by members of the general public and usually requiring substantial education, training or licensing.\" U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3, cmt. n. 3 (providing as examples the skills possessed by \"pilots, lawyers, doctors, accountants, chemists, and demolition experts\"). The government argued at sentencing \"that to pilot a vessel . . . on rough seas, high waves, traveling for at least 30 hours from the Dominican Republic towards Puerto Rico\" necessarily demonstrated use of a special skill.</p>\n<p>The district court did not specify its basis for pinning the label to the four defendants. No one other than Martinez (who, perhaps wisely, does not contest the adjustment as applied to him) was observed using a GPS or any other navigational device requiring some degree of sophisticated knowledge. So far as we can determine from the evidence, the others who received the adjustment merely took the helm at points during the voyage. The vessel, as the government pointed out, had none of the standard navigation or safety equipment that would ordinarily be used for a lengthy sea voyage.</p>\n<p>Captaining a vessel fully equipped for the high seas doubtless requires special skills, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Montero-Montero,</i> 370 F.3d 121, 123-24 (1st Cir. 2004), and certain seafaring skills would doubtless qualify (<i>e.g.,</i> navigation, communications, engineering). But steering a simple sailing vessel along a course, as directed by another, does not appear to us to be a special skill and the district judge did not say that the three defendants did any more than this or had the training or expertise to do more.</p>\n<p>Rodriguez is described in the pre-sentence report as a \"lifetime construction worker\" with \"no other employment history\"; Peguero, as a construction worker and a farm worker (the government conceded that Peguero was not \"trained in any matters of the sea\"). Milan's pre-sentence report alone contains a reference to his background as a fisherman in the Dominican Republic but this bare statement could cover anything from a rowboat to serious sailing; and some of what he did seemingly involved capturing small crabs at the beach.</p>\n<p>The government points to no evidence that Rodriguez or Peguero had any sailing or navigational experience or that Milan, even if he had specialized experience, used it here. Although the term \"yawl\" was used at trial, the vessel used here appears to have been little more than a wooden <span class=\"star-pagination\">*79</span> hull with two outboard motors affixed. The level of skill required to steer such a vessel under the direction of a man with a GPS can hardly be compared even to that needed to keep a sailboat on course. On this record the special skills adjustment cannot stand, <i>accord </i><i>United States v. Batista De La Cruz,</i> 460 F.3d 466, 469 (3d Cir.2006), and new sentences are required with the adjustment deleted.</p>\n<p>Our decision has addressed the defendants' colorable claims; other claims have been considered but require no discussion. We commend the skillful work of the district judge in this complicated trial; given the number of defendants and the variety of issues presented, it is a credit to him that there remain only a few loose ends as to three sentences that can be readily resolved on remand.</p>\n<p>The convictions of all five defendants are <i>affirmed,</i> as are the sentences imposed on Hilario and Martinez. The sentences of the other three defendants (Rodriguez, Milan and Peguero) are <i>vacated</i> and their cases are remanded for re-sentencing in accordance with this decision.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The indictment also included a separate count against Peguero for intimidating witnesses but the jury acquitted on this count and it is not at issue on appeal.</p>\n<p>[2]  The ordinary rule, in the absence of such a distinction in the substantive statute, is that an aider and abettor is treated as a principal, 18 U.S.C. § 2, and is punishable accordingly. <i>See </i><i>United States v.

The U.S. Coast Guard and Puerto Rico authorities brought eighty-five of the passengers safely to shore; seven others were confirmed dead at the scene.</p>\n<p>Based on identifications made by some of the passengers on the beach, five individualsLeonardo Hilario-Hilario (\"Hilario\"), Kennedi Martinez (\"Martinez\"), Fernando Jose Milan (\"Milan\"), Delgadino Peguero (\"Peguero\"), and Santiago Rodriguez (\"Rodriguez\")were separated out as those who had conducted the smuggling venture. Although generally referred to by the government as \"captains,\" Hilario turned out to be the man in charge and the others, although sometimes involved in piloting, were crew.</p>\n<p>After further investigation, all five defendants were charged on May 17, 2005, in a second superseding indictment, alleging that</p>\n<blockquote>aiding and abetting each other, [they] did, knowingly, willfully and intentionally, bring and attempt to bring to the United States, for private financial gain and profit, and by the use of an unseaworthy and overcrowded yawl which placed in jeopardy the lives of the aliens, approximately eighty-seven (87) aliens. . . . This violation resulted in the death of [seven passengers].</blockquote>\n<p>Fairly read, this formulation, although jumbled, charged each defendant with both the central offense of smuggling an alien into the United States or attempting to do so, 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(i) (2000), and the separately enumerated offense of aiding and abetting such an offense, <i>id.</i> § 1324(a)(1)(A)(v)(II). One who aids and abets is normally liable as a principal, 18 U.S.C. § 2 (2000), but the smuggling statute prescribes in certain cases a lower sentence for mere aiders and abettors. 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p>The references in the indictment to financial gain, placing life in jeopardy or committing an offense resulting in death invoked provisions of the statute's sentencing regime. Each one of these characteristics raises the maximum sentence available. 8 U.S.C. §§ 1324(a)(1)(B)(i), (iii), (iv). Although pertinent only to sentencing, a jury determination typically is required to invoke the higher sentences under familiar precedent. <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span> (2000).</p>\n<p>A fifteen-day jury trial followed at which ten of the passengers testified. The government relied heavily on eyewitness testimony to establish that the five defendants operated the vessel. Several passengers testified that Milan, Peguero, and Rodriguez piloted the yawl at various points during the journey; Martinez was identified as having navigated and steered the vessel with the help of a GPS or similar device, and Hilario was described as the \"head captain\" who gave orders to the others and maintained contact via cellular telephone with other organizers on land.</p>\n<p>The government also presented evidence to show the unseaworthiness of the vessel. The passengers described the overcrowded, unsafe, and unsanitary conditions on the vessel. Three members of the Coast Guard, who had participated in the rescue <span class=\"star-pagination\">*70</span> efforts, described the conditions of the surf, the rudimentary construction of the yawl (which had fallen apart in the surf along the Vega Alta coast), and the vessel's lack of bathrooms, lights, seats, radio, or appropriate safety or navigational equipment.</p>\n<p>All five defendants were convicted on the indictment count set forth above.<sup>[1]</sup> Pursuant to a special verdict, the jury found that all defendants acted for the purpose of financial gain, and all except Rodriguez placed the lives of the passengers in jeopardy and had participated in an offense resulting in the death of seven passengers. The district court later sentenced Hilario to 204 months in prison, Martinez and Peguero to 188 months, Milan to 176 months, and Rodriguez to 120 months.</p>\n<p>All five now appeal their convictions and sentences, arguing that various decisions made by the district judge deprived them of a fair trial and that their sentences were improper. Some of these arguments are pressed by all five defendants while others are unique to particular defendants. We begin with the collective attacks and then turn to the individual ones. The standard of review varies with the issue.</p>\n<p>All five defendants argue that pretrial identification, by means of the photograph line-up shown to the cooperating witnesses, was so suggestive that it fatally tainted the identification evidence at trial. The completed photo line-up contained fifty-eight color head shots of those taken from the waters alive, including all of the men; some of the women were included but others were left out after one of the prosecutors said that it was unnecessary to include the women.</p>\n<p>The fifty-eight photographs were arranged nine per-page (leaving four for the last page) in the order in which the subjects were processed by immigration officials. Since the five defendants had been separated from the remaining detainees, they were photographed last and appear in the final five photographs in the set. This was shown to the passengers who were willing to identify the \"captains.\" Thirty-seven passengers identified Hilario, forty identified Rodriguez, thirty-five identified Milan, twenty-seven identified Martinez, and nineteen identified Peguero.</p>\n<p>At trial, the defendants sought to have the photo line-up suppressed and to prohibit in-court identification of the defendants as tainted. The district court denied the motion and the government introduced the line-up and relied heavily at trial on in-court identification by the testifying passengers. Our review of the district court's denial of the motion to suppress the photo identification is plenary save that findings of fact are reviewed for clear error. <i>United States v.

Of all their attacks on this piece of evidence, the strongest is that the defendants' pictures were grouped together as the last five shown; and four of the defendants appear in the only pictures on the final page of the line-up. Other criticisms can be dealt with more briefly.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court says that a court should first look to the procedure <span class=\"star-pagination\">*71</span> itself to determine whether it was impermissibly suggestive, <i>United States v. Bouthot,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"526035\"><a href=\"/opinion/526035/united-states-v-joseph-t-bouthot/\"><span class=\"volume\">878</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1506</span></a></span>, 1514 (1st Cir.1989) (citing <i>Simmons v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1247</span></a></span> (1968)); if so, the court determines whether under the totality of the circumstances the suggestiveness is so pronounced that there is a serious likelihood of irreparable misidentification. <i>Neil v. Biggers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108639\"><a href=\"/opinion/108639/neil-v-biggers/\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">188</span></a></span>, 196-97, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108639\"><a href=\"/opinion/108639/neil-v-biggers/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">401</span></a></span> (1972).</p>\n<p>Suggestiveness is a matter of degree. In principle, a grouping of the defendants together might suggest an association among them; if one were recognized as culpable, this might heighten the chance that ones next to him might be so identified even if the witness were doubtful. Location at the end seems no more dangerous than at the beginning, and the grouping does not appear to be deliberate tampering; but we will assume, merely <i>arguendo,</i> that the line-up was suggestive.</p>\n<p>Yet the risk of prejudice was minimal. This is not a case in which a marginal identification<i>e.g.,</i> by a witness who only glimpsed the perpetrator of a crimemay have been bolstered by suggestive identification procedures. <i>See id.</i> at 199-200, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108639\"><a href=\"/opinion/108639/neil-v-biggers/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">375</span></a></span>. Here, the witnesses identifying the defendants had traveled with them for thirty hours at a close distance and without any attempt by any of the defendants to conceal their appearances during the trip.</p>\n<p>Further, the photo array was shown to the passengers on the same day as their arrival in Puerto Rico while their memories of the trip were still fresh. And defense counsel were given ample time at trial to explore any defects in the identification procedureincluding whether other individuals not pictured in the photo array were the true leaders of the smuggling ventureand to argue those defects to the jury in summation. The photo array did not create a serious risk of misidentification.</p>\n<p>As for the other criticisms, we are unable to discern the \"marked differences in skin color, clothing, and contrast of coloring\" that defendants claim rendered the line-up suggestive. While some of the photographs, as the district court pointed out, do \"look more like mug shots,\" none of these depicts any of the defendants. Nor were the latter identifications tainted when the government at the beachbased on passenger identificationconspicuously separated the defendants from the other passengers.</p>\n<p>The defendants also object to the admission of certain testimony given by two Coast Guard officers involved in the rescue, Lieutenants Lahcen Armstrong and William Nunes. Armstrong testified extensively about the size and appearance of the yawl, the number of passengers, and sea conditions at the time. Over objection he was allowed to testify about what safety equipment such a vessel should have had (but here didn't) and the maximum number of passengers that could safely be carried.</p>\n<p>Specifically, Armstrong said that such a vessel required \"properly maintained engines. . . navigational lights and equipment. . . life preservers, for all the people on board, navigational charts and potentially GPS electronic devices, [and] VHS/FM radios\" and that he \"would expect a vessel that size to have no more than 20 to 30 people on board safely.\" Nunes stated that a vessel the size of the yawl could not sustain the swells and rough surf it encountered.</p>\n<p>The objection, duly preserved, is that neither officer was specified as an expert in advance of trial, as is required by governing rules. Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(a)(1)(G). <span class=\"star-pagination\">*72</span> The government argues that no notice was required because the lieutenants delivered only lay opinion testimony, which is not subject to Rule 16's disclosure requirements. The recurring problem is that \"the same witnessfor example, a law enforcement officermay be qualified to `provide both lay and expert testimony in a single case.'\" <i>United States v. Ayala-Pizarro,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201579\"><a href=\"/opinion/201579/united-states-v-ayala-pizarro/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 28 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">902</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

But we think it is quite arguable, and proceed on that <i>arguendo</i> premise, that some of Armstrong's testimony as to specific necessary safety precautions and vessel capacity seems to be based on specialized knowledge and also to reflect the heightened sophistication normally associated with expert testimony.</p>\n<p>But \"[t]o succeed in obtaining a reversal on appeal, a defendant must prove both an abuse of discretion and prejudice.\" <i>United States v.

Indeed, defense counsel objected to the introduction of testimony from other Coast Guard officers on the ground that it was \"irrelevant or cumulative\" because \"there [was] no issue that there were unsafe conditions on the boat.\"</p>\n<p>The defendants do not complain that the witnesses were not formally qualified as experts, presumably because their qualifications were apparent. This does not automatically mitigate a Rule 16 violation if one occurred; the rule helps the opponent to develop cross examination and to retain a counter-expert. But on the present facts, the witnesses were quite unlikely to be impeached on their main points and defendants knew at the outset that unseaworthiness was a critical issue.</p>\n<p>The defendants further assert that they are entitled to a new trial because the jury selection process did not adequately probe jurors' prejudices. They say that the district court erred in refusing to ask eighty proposed voir dire questions designed to uncover, among other things, potential jurors' biases concerning illegal immigrants, immigration in general, individuals hailing from the Dominican Republic, and prior exposure to the case through the media.</p>\n<p>While the trial judge did not ask the precise questions requested, he conducted a thorough and searching voir dire, covering <i>inter alia</i> whether the jurors had pre-existing views of the defendants' guilt or innocence; whether they had learned anything about the case through any media; whether any jurors would be prejudiced by evidence of the seven deaths; and, importantly, whether the jurors had feelings about Dominican nationals or illegal immigrants that would impair the ability to come to a fair, impartial, and just decision.</p>\n<p>Nor did the district court err, as the defendants now argue, by failing to question all members of the venire individually. Individual questioning may sometimes be appropriate, but this decision, like most in the conduct of the voir dire, rests in the district court's sound judgment. <i>United States v. Orlando-Figueroa,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199119\"><a href=\"/opinion/199119/united-states-v-orlando-figueroa/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span>, 43 (1st Cir.2000). Defendants are also far from showing that they were prejudiced by the district court's handling of the venire. <i>See </i><i>United States v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">91</span></span> (2007).</p>\n<p>Next, defendants assail the district court's refusal to enjoin the government from speaking to the press. At trial, Martinez and Hilario filed separate motions seeking a court order to enjoin the prosecution from making further statements to the press; both motions referred to an article published by the San Juan Star on May 9, 2005, in which the government confirmed the date of the upcoming trial and the penalties the government was seeking.</p>\n<p>In subsequent motions the parties disputed whether other statements in the articleincluding the claim that \"dozens of survivors identified the accused as the organizers of the ill-fated crossing\"were properly attributed to the government in violation of local rules prohibiting prosecutors from publicly commenting on the evidence presented at trial. We found no recorded ruling by the court; conceivably, the matter was dealt with in chambers or simply dropped.</p>\n<p>In all events, while defendants refer to the \"unprecedented media coverage\" following the rescue and call the publicity \"inflammatory,\" they do not show that the government was responsible for anything beyond a description of the trial date and penalties sought. Under these circumstances, we see no basis for saying that the failure to issue the requested injunction resulted in harmful publicity or otherwise prejudiced the defendants.</p>\n<p>We turn now to the objections made by individual defendants, starting with Milan's claim that his fifth and sixth amendment rights were violated by the admission of statements he made to federal agents who interrogated him after his arrest. Milan was interviewed after his arrest by federal agents in the early morning hours of December 4, 2004, and again interrogated by two agents and two prosecutors on the afternoon of December 5, 2004. In each case he was given <i>Miranda</i> warnings and signed waiver forms.</p>\n<p>During these interviews, Milan admitted to being involved in the smuggling venture and confirmed that he had, at times, piloted the vessel. He gave other details about the trip and identified from a photo spread the pictures of the other individuals involved and specified those who had controlled the engines. At trial, the district judge allowed the statements to be used against Milan, redacting references to other defendants to comply with <i>Bruton v.

Other trial testimony amply established the involvement of other defendants, and the redaction was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p>Nor did the court violate Milan's right to confront witnesses against him when he was not allowed to question the agents to bring out his own admissions implicating other defendants. \"Since the deletion of the [redacted testimony] was not prejudicial . . . it was within the district court's discretion to so limit cross-examination, and no independent sixth amendment issue is raised.\" <i>Thuna,</i> 786 F.2d at 442 n. 10. The agents, of course, had no first hand knowledge of the relevant events and Milan was himself free to testify first hand about the involvement of others if he chose.</p>\n<p>Martinez says that the district court should have granted his motions for acquittal and for a new trial. Martinez says that based on the evidence he was no more than a passenger on the yawl and did not participate in the smuggling venture. On this claim, we view the evidence in the government's favor and affirm the conviction if a rational jury could conclude that the prosecution proved all elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>United States v. Beltran,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202934\"><a href=\"/opinion/202934/united-states-v-beltran/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 2 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>At trial, nine of the ten witnesses testified against Martinez, saying (for example) that he assisted with the navigation of the vessel and received payment from one of the passengers. (In fact, Martinez was identified by many more but the judge limited witness testimony as cumulative.) The motion to acquit was properly denied and the denial of a new trial was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p>Hilario claims that the government tainted his conviction by intimating, in its closing statement, that Hilario refused to bring the yawl ashore because he had not yet confirmed that each passenger had a friend or family member waiting on land to pay the trip organizers. The prosecutor claimed \"that profit, that profit that they were going to make off this trip was why defendant Leonardo Hilario-Hilario would not allow that yawl to come to land until contact was made with the people on land.\"</p>\n<p>There was evidence that travelers were to be held ashore until further payments were made and that Hilario was heard discussing the matter on a cellular telephone. Possibly the prosecutor's inference was a step beyond what was proved; but <span class=\"star-pagination\">*75</span> there was no contemporaneous objection, meaning that review is for plain error only. <i>United States v.

We have no reason to think that this single comment altered the outcome.</p>\n<p>This brings us to the defendants' attacks on their sentences. By far the most important is one advanced by Rodriguez, namely, that his ten-year sentence exceeds the maximum allowed under the statute; he asks that we remand his case to the district court for re-sentencing subject to a statutory maximum of only five years. Statutory context is required to grasp his argument.</p>\n<p>The governing statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1324, defines prohibited conduct as, among other things, knowingly \"bring[ing] to or attempt[ing] to bring to the United States [an alien] at a place other than a designated port of entry,\" <i>id.</i> § 1324(a)(1)(A)(i), or aiding and abetting the commission of prohibited acts, <i>id.</i> § 1324(a)(1)(A)(v)(II). Subsection (a)(1)(B) provides the pertinent maximum sentences, which vary based on the circumstances surrounding the crime's commission.</p>\n<p>Importantly, a defendant convicted of smuggling an alien is subject to a ten-year maximum, <i>id.</i> § 1324(a)(1)(B)(i), but quite unusuallyone convicted solely of aiding or abetting can be imprisoned for no more than five years, <i>id.</i> § 1324(a)(1)(B)(ii).<sup>[2]</sup> Stiffer maximums are provided for jeopardizing the life of another or causing serious bodily injury (twenty-year maximum) or for committing an offense resulting in death (maximum of life imprisonment). <i>Id.</i> §§ 1324(a)(1)(B)(iii), (iv).</p>\n<p>The indictment (quoted above) charged the five defendants in a single count with violating section 1324(a)(1)(A)(i)'s prohibition on the smuggling of aliens as well as section 1324(a)(1)(A)(v)(II)'s aiding and abetting prohibition; it further alleged that the defendants had acted for purposes of financial gain and that the smuggling venture had jeopardized the lives of the passengers, resulting in the death of seven of them, triggering enhanced penalties under sections 1324(a)(1)(B)(iii) and (iv).</p>\n<p>The district court gave instructions to the jury covering both smuggling and aiding and abetting that offense, and asked whether each defendant was guilty or not guilty \"[a]s to count one of the indictment.\" It also gave the jury special verdict questions directed to financial gain, jeopardizing the lives of passengers, and death; but, probably because such a distinction ordinarily does not matter (see note 2, above), it did not ask the jury to determine whether each defendant was guilty of smuggling or merely aiding and abetting.</p>\n<p>As to the defendants other than Rodriguez, this makes no difference because the jury's special verdict determined that each had jeopardized the lives of others and that death had resulted, triggering imprisonment for \"any term of years or for life. . . .\" <i>Id.</i> §§ 1324(a)(1)(B)(iii), (iv). But no such jury finding was made against Rodriguez; and, if only an aider and abettor, his maximum term should be five years. <i>Compare id.</i> § 1324(a)(1)(B)(i) <i>with</i> (ii).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*76</span> Rodriguez did not raise this issue at sentencing but raises it now on appeal, so our review is only for plain error and we may reverse only if we conclude that the error was plain and prejudicial, and (if uncorrected) would cause a miscarriage of justice. <i>United States v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">311</span></a></span> (1999), and here we cannot tell from the jury verdict that Rodriguez was convicted of smuggling (rather than aiding and abetting).</p>\n<p>So the ten-year sentence was error and prejudicial but was it a miscarriage of justice? Ordinarily, we will treat a sentence that nakedly exceeds the statutory maximum as plain error;<sup>[3]</sup> but that assumes that the defendant could not lawfully have been given that sentence. Here, Rodriguez could have been given that sentence if the evidence allowed him to be convicted as a principal and the jury so found. It might be enough to negate miscarriage if the evidence were compelling and the jury likely so found. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Portes,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202971\"><a href=\"/opinion/202971/united-states-v-portes/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">570</span></span> (2007).</p>\n<p>The jury did have enough evidence to convict Rodriguez as a principal. Anyone who helped operate the ship could technically be treated as a principal and there was testimonyalbeit contradicted by another witnessthat Rodriguez helped pilot the vessel. And (as we will see) the evidence would also have permitted the jury to conclude, as did the trial judge, that Rodriguez brandished a knife; but again the evidence was mixed and the jury may well not have viewed it as did the trial judge.</p>\n<p>In all events Rodriguez was not in chargethe defendant most like a captain was Hilarioand, in a group enterprise, a jury could choose to regard someone whose role seemed to it less culpable as merely an aider and abettor. Here, for whatever reason, the jury assigned Rodriguez a lesser role than the other defendants since it found him alone not responsible for endangering the passengers or culpable for the deaths. So we have no reason to think it convicted him of the substantive offense of smuggling.</p>\n<p>The government, which could have asked for a special verdict to establish that each defendant was a smuggler and not merely an aider and abettor, simply says that the evidence was sufficient for the former designation. This does not show that the jury convicted Rodriguez as a smuggler, or inevitably would have convicted him on this basis if it had been asked to choose. Nor does the government offer any alternative to Rodriguez' proposed remedy, namely, a remand for re-sentencing him within the five-year maximum.</p>\n<p>The government does not argue that the district judge could now substitute his own determination for one that the Supreme Court has said must be made by the jury. <i>Jones,</i> 526 U.S. at 251-52, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118274\"><a href=\"/opinion/118274/jones-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1215</span></a></span>. Nor, given double jeopardy principles, is it clear that the penalty issue could now be re-submitted to a new jury. <i>But see </i><i>United States v. Williams,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"42637\"><a href=\"/opinion/42637/united-states-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">635</span></a></span>, 646 (5th Cir.2006). Absent any alternative <span class=\"star-pagination\">*77</span> suggestion from the government, the straightforward course is to remand for resentencing Rodriguez within the statutory maximum of five years in prison.</p>\n<p>In computing Rodriguez' guideline range, the district judge imposed on him a four-level upward adjustment for brandishing a dangerous weapon. U.S.S.G. § 2L1.1(b)(4)(B) (2004). Rodriguez claims that he used what he calls a \"kitchen knife,\" and the government calls a machete, merely to cut salami to distribute to the passengers during the trip. But the district court found that the knife was brandished and there is evidence to support this view.</p>\n<p>One witness claimed that Rodriguez first used the knife only to cut salami, but later wielded the knife during a confrontation, telling passengers to \"get down if you don't want us to cut your neck;\" a second said that Rodriguez \"pressured\" the passengers to remain calm by \"carrying a machete in his hand\" in an aggressive manner. A third witness said that Rodriguez used the knife only to cut salami but conceded that \"there was one time he was speaking to the people telling them to relax with that knife in his hands.\"</p>\n<p>The conduct described by the first two witnesses amounts to \"brandishing\" under the definition that \"all or part of the weapon was displayed, or the presence of the weapon was otherwise made known to another person, in order to intimidate that person,\" U.S.S.G. § 1B1.1, cmt. n. 1(c); <i>see </i><i>United States v. LaFortune,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198642\"><a href=\"/opinion/198642/united-states-v-lafortune/\"><span class=\"volume\">192</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">157</span></a></span>, 161-62 (1st Cir.1999), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1129</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></span> (2000). To overturn the finding would require a showing of clear error by the sentencing judge, <i>United States v. Thongsophaporn,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1219669\"><a href=\"/opinion/1219669/united-states-v-thongsophaporn/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span>, 57-58 (1st Cir.2007), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">117</span></span> (2008), so we sustain the adjustment as to Rodriguez.</p>\n<p>This may not matter as to Rodriguez given the five-year maximum. But it does matter to the other defendants to whom Rodriguez' use of the knife was attributed based on guideline rules applicable to \"jointly undertaken criminal activity\" that is \"reasonably foreseeable\" to other actors. U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3(a)(1)(B). That the group was engaged in \"jointly undertaken criminal activity\" is obvious; the harder question is whether the use of the knife in aid of the endeavor was \"reasonably foreseeable\" to the other defendants.</p>\n<p>The defendants say that the knife was brought on board innocently and that smuggling of illegal aliens does not normally involve coercion or violence. But the knife was still a weapon and, in this operation, the passengers were not to be released until additional sums were paid to the organizers upon their arrivalresistance being a real possibility in such a situation. Under these circumstances we cannot say that it was clear error to find that misuse of the knife was reasonably foreseeable. <i>See United States v. Santiago,</i> 200 Fed.Appx. 928, 934-35 (11th Cir. 2006) (unpublished decision).</p>\n<p>Hilario argues for himself that the district court improperly applied a three-level increase to his offense level based on his role as a \"manager or supervisor\" of the smuggling operation. Such an enhancement is appropriate \"if there is evidence that a defendant, in committing the crime, exercised control over, or was otherwise responsible for overseeing the activities of, at least one other person.\" <i>United States v. Voccola,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197057\"><a href=\"/opinion/197057/united-states-v-voccola/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, 44 (1st Cir.1996) (quoting <i>United States v. Savoie,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600257\"><a href=\"/opinion/600257/united-states-v-paul-j-savoie/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">612</span></a></span>, 616 (1st Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p>Hilario used a cellular phone and was overheard discussing logistics of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*78</span> operation with another participant; he was also identified as the captain who gave instructions to other participants and determined whether and when the boat would be brought to shore. The district court was entitled to impose the upward adjustment based on this evidence.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>The same is not so easily said about the two-level \"special skill\" adjustment imposed on all defendants save Hilario. U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3 (permitting for an adjustment where the defendant \"used a special skill[] in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense\"). Peguero, Milan and Rodriguez dispute the district court's conclusion that each of them possessed a special skill within the meaning of the guidelines. We review this claim more closely, <i>United States v. Noah,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197675\"><a href=\"/opinion/197675/united-states-v-noah/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">490</span></a></span>, 499 (1st Cir.1997), because it turns less on fact finding and more on what the guideline means by \"special skill.\"</p>\n<p>The guidelines define a special skill as \"a skill not possessed by members of the general public and usually requiring substantial education, training or licensing.\" U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3, cmt. n. 3 (providing as examples the skills possessed by \"pilots, lawyers, doctors, accountants, chemists, and demolition experts\"). The government argued at sentencing \"that to pilot a vessel . . . on rough seas, high waves, traveling for at least 30 hours from the Dominican Republic towards Puerto Rico\" necessarily demonstrated use of a special skill.</p>\n<p>The district court did not specify its basis for pinning the label to the four defendants. No one other than Martinez (who, perhaps wisely, does not contest the adjustment as applied to him) was observed using a GPS or any other navigational device requiring some degree of sophisticated knowledge. So far as we can determine from the evidence, the others who received the adjustment merely took the helm at points during the voyage. The vessel, as the government pointed out, had none of the standard navigation or safety equipment that would ordinarily be used for a lengthy sea voyage.</p>\n<p>Captaining a vessel fully equipped for the high seas doubtless requires special skills, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Montero-Montero,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201078\"><a href=\"/opinion/201078/united-states-v-montero-montero/\"><span class=\"volume\">370</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">121</span></a></span>, 123-24 (1st Cir. 2004), and certain seafaring skills would doubtless qualify (<i>e.g.,</i> navigation, communications, engineering). But steering a simple sailing vessel along a course, as directed by another, does not appear to us to be a special skill and the district judge did not say that the three defendants did any more than this or had the training or expertise to do more.</p>\n<p>Rodriguez is described in the pre-sentence report as a \"lifetime construction worker\" with \"no other employment history\"; Peguero, as a construction worker and a farm worker (the government conceded that Peguero was not \"trained in any matters of the sea\"). Milan's pre-sentence report alone contains a reference to his background as a fisherman in the Dominican Republic but this bare statement could cover anything from a rowboat to serious sailing; and some of what he did seemingly involved capturing small crabs at the beach.</p>\n<p>The government points to no evidence that Rodriguez or Peguero had any sailing or navigational experience or that Milan, even if he had specialized experience, used it here. Although the term \"yawl\" was used at trial, the vessel used here appears to have been little more than a wooden <span class=\"star-pagination\">*79</span> hull with two outboard motors affixed. The level of skill required to steer such a vessel under the direction of a man with a GPS can hardly be compared even to that needed to keep a sailboat on course. On this record the special skills adjustment cannot stand, <i>accord </i><i>United States v. Batista De La Cruz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795427\"><a href=\"/opinion/795427/united-states-v-fernando-batista-de-la-cruz/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span>, 469 (3d Cir.2006), and new sentences are required with the adjustment deleted.</p>\n<p>Our decision has addressed the defendants' colorable claims; other claims have been considered but require no discussion. We commend the skillful work of the district judge in this complicated trial; given the number of defendants and the variety of issues presented, it is a credit to him that there remain only a few loose ends as to three sentences that can be readily resolved on remand.</p>\n<p>The convictions of all five defendants are <i>affirmed,</i> as are the sentences imposed on Hilario and Martinez. The sentences of the other three defendants (Rodriguez, Milan and Peguero) are <i>vacated</i> and their cases are remanded for re-sentencing in accordance with this decision.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The indictment also included a separate count against Peguero for intimidating witnesses but the jury acquitted on this count and it is not at issue on appeal.</p>\n<p>[2]  The ordinary rule, in the absence of such a distinction in the substantive statute, is that an aider and abettor is treated as a principal, 18 U.S.C. § 2, and is punishable accordingly. <i>See </i><i>United States v.
