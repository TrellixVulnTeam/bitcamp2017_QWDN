GIBSON, Circuit Judge.         We are called upon to\n\ndecide whether a deliberate executive decision by a state actor,\n\nbased only on a partisan political change of administration, to\n\ndeprive independent contractors of a payment to which they are\n\nlegally entitled, violates the contractors' First Amendment rights.\n\nWe hold that it does. Accordingly, we reverse the district court's\n\ndismissal of the First Amendment claims of Remexcel Managerial\n\nConsultants, Inc., and Maria S. Kortright arising under 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1983. We affirm the district court's dismissal of their due\n\nprocess claims and of all the claims asserted by Reinaldo Ramírez.\n\n                                    I.\n\n              Because this suit was dismissed under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim, we review the district\n\ncourt's decision de novo and take the facts as pleaded in the\n\ncomplaint, drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs'\n\nfavor.    Campagna v. Massachusetts Dep't of Envtl. Prot., 334 F.3d\n\n150, 154 (1st Cir. 2003).      The complaint alleges that Ramírez and\n\nhis    company,    Remexcel,   entered     into     a   contract       with   the\n\nMunicipality of Guayanilla during the tenure of Mayor Ceferino\n\nPacheco Guidicelli, who was a member of the New Progressive Party,\n\nor \"NPP.\"     The contract called for Remexcel to provide accounting\n\nservices that would identify taxpayers who had not paid taxes owed\n\nto the Municipality. Remexcel's compensation was to be ten percent\n\nof    taxes   successfully   collected    as   a   result   of   its    efforts.\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fPursuant to the contract, Remexcel identified deficiencies in the\n\namount   of     $4,444,058.87       owed     by     Stinnes    Interoil        to     the\n\nMunicipality for the tax years from 1992 to 1997.                             Following\n\nadministrative        proceedings      in     which     Remexcel        assisted      the\n\nMunicipality,     the       Municipality    notified     Stinnes        of   its     final\n\ndetermination        that    Stinnes   owed    $4,419,100.28        in       taxes    and\n\ninterest.     Stinnes objected and filed a lawsuit in the Puerto Rico\n\ncourts, Veba Oil Supply v. Municipality of Guyanilla, Civil No. JCO\n\n96-0003 (Super. Ct. Ponce).\n\n            The Municipality was obliged to hire counsel to defend\n\nthe lawsuit. It hired Kortright under a contingency contract, which\n\ngave her the right to ten percent of the moneys collected as a\n\nresult of her work.          She worked on the litigation through the end\n\nof 2000, doing legal research, investigating the facts, and filing\n\nthe summary judgment motions on which the suit was ultimately\n\nresolved.     However, at the beginning of 2001, a new mayor, Edgardo\n\nArlequín,     took    office;     Arlequín     is   a   member     of    the    Popular\n\nDemocratic Party, or \"PDP.\"\n\n            The complaint alleges that Arlequín began \"a pattern and\n\npractice of discrimination by taking adverse action against anyone\n\nassociated with the prior New Progressive Party administration at\n\nany   level.\"        Arlequín    \"refused     to    continue     any     professional\n\nassociation with the Plaintiffs.\"             Kortright was told to withdraw\n\nas counsel for the Municipality in the Veba Oil case, which she did\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fon January 22, 2001.    She was replaced with a new lawyer, who did\n\nnothing of record but enter his appearance before the court granted\n\nsummary judgment to the Municipality in the amount of $4.5 million,\n\nbased on Kortright's work.        The new lawyer then settled the suit\n\nfor $3 million dollars, of which $1.8 million was paid to the\n\nMunicipality and $1.2 million was paid to a different municipality.\n\n          The complaint alleges that Arlequín and the Municipality\n\nrefused to pay Ramírez, Remexcel, and Kortright moneys which they\n\nhad earned and to which they were entitled and that the only reason\n\nfor the refusal was their association with the previous mayor. The\n\ncomplaint alleges causes of action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against\n\nthe Municipality and against Arlequín, individually and in his\n\nofficial capacity, for violation of Ramírez's, Remexcel's, and\n\nKortright's   First    Amendment     right   of    association     and    for\n\ndeprivation of property without due process of law, as well as a\n\nclaim for breach of contract.\n\n          Arlequín    and   the   Municipality     moved   to   dismiss   the\n\ncomplaint for failure to state a claim.           The district court held\n\nthat Ramírez lacked standing to assert a claim because the only\n\ninjury was to Remexcel and Ramírez did not have standing to assert\n\nthe corporation's claim. Ramírez v. Arlequín, 357 F. Supp. 2d 416,\n\n421 (D.P.R. 2005).\n\n          The district court next considered whether Remexcel and\n\nKortright were entitled to First Amendment protection against the\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\ftermination of their contracts.               Applying precedents governing\n\ntermination of government employment, such as Elrod v. Burns, 427\n\nU.S. 347 (1976), and Branti v. Finkel, 445 U.S. 507 (1980), the\n\ndistrict   court    held   that    as   a     lawyer,    Kortright    occupied   a\n\nconfidential position and so was not entitled to protection from\n\npolitical firing.         Ramírez, 357 F. Supp. 2d at 421-24.                  The\n\ndistrict   court    held    that    Remexcel's      contract    also    involved\n\npolicymaking, and so was not entitled to protection from political\n\ndiscrimination.      Id. at 425.            The district court stated that\n\nKortright and Remexcel's claims for moneys earned were merely\n\ncontract claims, not claims for political discrimination.                 Id. at\n\n424-25. The district court dismissed Remexcel's and Kortright's\n\nprocedural due process claims on the ground that they had no\n\nproperty interest in the proceeds of their contracts.                 Id. at 426-\n\n27.   Their substantive due process claims were dismissed because\n\nthey alleged neither conduct that shocked the conscience nor\n\ndeprivation   of    the    kind    of   interests       \"actionable    under   the\n\nsubstantive modality of the due process clause.\" Id. at 427.\n\nHaving dismissed the federal claims, the district court then\n\ndeclined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the contract\n\nclaim arising under Commonwealth law.             Id.\n\n           Ramírez, Remexcel, and Kortright appeal the dismissal of\n\ntheir claims.      However, Ramírez does not argue that the district\n\ncourt erred in holding that he lacked standing; we therefore\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fconsider him to have waived the argument, and we will consider the\n\nremaining arguments only with regard to Remexcel and Kortright.\n\n                                     II.\n\n            Remexcel and Kortright argue that their complaint states\n\na violation of substantive and procedural due process, as well as\n\na violation of their First Amendment rights. In Zinermon v. Burch,\n\n494 U.S. 113, 125 (1990), the Supreme Court identified three kinds\n\nof due process claims that can be asserted under § 1983: (1) for\n\nviolation   of   one   of   the   substantive   rights    found   in   other\n\nprovisions of the Constitution, such as the First Amendment; (2)\n\nfor arbitrary, wrongful government actions, regardless of the\n\nfairness of the procedure used; and (3) for deprivation of life,\n\nliberty or property by unfair procedures.         Remexcel and Kortright\n\nallege all three kinds of claims.\n\n                                     A.\n\n            Under the doctrine of \"unconstitutional conditions,\" the\n\ngovernment may not deny a benefit to a person on a basis that\n\ninfringes the person's First Amendment rights.           Bd. of Comm'rs v.\n\nUmbehr, 518 U.S. 668, 674 (1996).          Under the related doctrine of\n\n\"retaliation,\" the government may not impose burdens on persons in\n\norder to discourage or punish them from exercising protected\n\nconstitutional rights. See Powell v. Alexander, 391 F.3d 1, 16-17\n\n(1st Cir. 2004) (citing Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v.\n\nDoyle, 429 U.S. 274 (1977)); Rosenfeld v. Egy, 346 F.3d 11, 15 (1st\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fCir. 2003).      Generally, the government may not coerce persons into\n\nsupporting a political party or punish them for exercising their\n\nright    of    association.      O'Hare    Truck   Serv.,       Inc.   v.   City   of\n\nNorthlake, 518 U.S. 712, 721 (1996) (\"[T]he government may not\n\ncoerce support in this manner, unless it has some justification\n\nbeyond dislike of the individual's political association.\").\n\n               The disputed question in this case is whether Remexcel\n\nand Kortright were entitled to First Amendment protection against\n\nretaliation for their affiliation with the former Mayor and the\n\nNPP.     It might be tempting to view this case as just a breach of\n\ncontract claim with no constitutional dimension.                       As discussed\n\nbelow, Remexcel's and Kortright's Fourteenth Amendment procedural\n\ndue process claim fails because state contract remedies provide the\n\nrequisite due process.        Remexcel's and Kortright's First Amendment\n\nclaim,    on    the   other   hand,   is   premised   on    a    constitutionally\n\nproscribed reason for the alleged breach of contract–namely, the\n\npolitical affiliation of individuals claiming a right to payment\n\nfor work already performed.           Although we must always be concerned\n\nabout constitutionalizing traditional common law claims, we see no\n\ntheoretical bar to the First Amendment claim that is alleged here.\n\n               In a line of cases brought by government employees who\n\nwere fired or penalized because of their political association, the\n\nSupreme Court held that there is no right to protection for\n\npolitical affiliation where political affiliation is legitimately\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\frelevant to the employee's job. See Branti v. Finkel, 445 U.S. 507\n\n(1980); Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 367-68 (1976) (plurality).\n\n\"[I]f an employee's private political beliefs would interfere with\n\nthe discharge of his public duties, his First Amendment rights may\n\nbe required to yield to the State's vital interest in maintaining\n\ngovernmental effectiveness and efficiency.\"        Branti, 445 U.S. at\n\n517. In Elrod, Justice Stewart's concurring opinion identified the\n\nkind of jobs that were protected from political discrimination as\n\n\"nonpolicymaking, nonconfidential\" government jobs.          427 U.S. at\n\n375.   Branti   clarified   that   the   policymaking   or   confidential\n\ncriteria are merely signposts for the real question of whether the\n\ngovernment has a legitimate interest in using political persuasion\n\nin hiring and firing:\n\n       [T]he ultimate inquiry is not whether the label\n       \"policymaker\" or \"confidential\" fits a particular\n       position; rather, the question is whether the hiring\n       authority can demonstrate that party affiliation is an\n       appropriate requirement for the effective performance of\n       the public office involved.\n\n445 U.S. at 518.\n\n            The district court concluded that Remexcel and Kortright\n\nperformed policymaking or confidential duties under their contracts\n\nwith the Municipality, and that they were therefore not entitled to\n\nFirst Amendment protection against discrimination based on their\n\npolitical affiliation. Ramírez, 357 F. Supp. 2d at 421-25. We must\n\ndecide whether the exemption of \"policymakers\" from protection\n\nagainst political affiliation discrimination applies outside the\n\n                                   -8-\n\fgovernment      employment      context    to     someone     who   is    neither   a\n\ngovernment employee nor seeks a continuing relationship with the\n\ngovernment, but who merely asks to be paid in accordance with a\n\ncontract which that person has already performed.\n\n           This circuit has held that the government's policymaking\n\ninterest could override the First Amendment protection against\n\npolitical discrimination, even where the plaintiff was not a\n\ngovernment employee.      In Prisma Zona Exploratoria de Puerto Rico,\n\nInc. v. Calderón, 310 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2002), Prisma Zona had\n\nnegotiated an agreement with two public corporations created by\n\nPuerto   Rico    for   Prisma    Zona     to    operate   a   children's      museum;\n\nhowever, Prisma Zona had failed to obtain a final commitment from\n\nthe   corporations       before     an         election     brought      in   a   new\n\nadministration, allegedly hostile to Prisma Zona because of its\n\npolitical affiliation. The new administration refused to transfer\n\nthe museum funds to Prisma Zona.           Prisma Zona brought a § 1983 suit\n\nalleging that the governor and others refused to transfer the\n\nassets to Prisma Zona because of its political affiliation and that\n\nthis discrimination violated its First Amendment rights. Id. at 4.\n\nThis court said the \"legal landscape\" for the claim was the Elrod\n\nline of cases.         Id. at 4-5.         Prisma Zona contended that the\n\ngovernment could not decide against transferring the funds based on\n\nPrisma Zona's political affiliation, but we held it could, based on\n\nanalogy to the government's right to fire policymakers for having\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\fthe wrong political affiliation:\n\n     Even in core cases involving politically motivated\n     hirings and firings, the Supreme Court has itself\n     recognized that a wholly antiseptic application of the\n     Elrod principle is unrealistic.          Instead, party\n     affiliation is an appropriate consideration in hiring and\n     firing decisions with respect to government positions\n     that   may  be   characterized   as   \"policymaking\"   or\n     \"confidential.\"\n\n           Here, Prisma seeks to attack a set of decisions\n     related to the possible privatization (whether to do so\n     and through whom) of the operation of a children's museum\n     and directing to it millions of dollars of public monies.\n     Where policy choices of this magnitude are presented,\n     courts ought not be second-guessing how much party\n     politics in the narrower sense may also have played a\n     role.\n\nId. at 7 (emphasis in original; citations omitted); accord Walker\n\nv. City of Lakewood, 272 F.3d 1114, 1132 (9th Cir. 2001).              Thus, in\n\nPrisma Zona we applied the policymaking exemption from First\n\nAmendment protection outside the government employment setting.\n\n            Even though the policymaking exemption can apply to non-\n\nemployees, there remains an important distinction between Kortright\n\nand Remexcel, on the one hand, and Prisma Zona and the fired\n\ngovernment employees, on the other.             Prisma Zona and the fired\n\nemployees sought a continuing relationship with the government that\n\nwould   hamstring    the    government's      ability    to   change    policy\n\ndirections, while Remexcel and Kortright seek only payment for\n\nservices already rendered.         While the government has a legitimate\n\ninterest    in   having   employees    who    possess   all   the   attributes\n\nnecessary   for   their    jobs,   even,     where   appropriate,    political\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fattributes,   here   the   government    is   not   being   asked    to   keep\n\nunqualified employees or contractors.         Kortright and Remexcel were\n\nhired by a previous administration that considered them qualified,\n\nand they did their work for that administration; now, only the\n\ngovernment's obligation of payment remains.\n\n          We suggested twice in Prisma Zona that the result might\n\nhave been different if Prisma Zona had obtained a binding contract\n\nto operate the museum.     First, we said that the lack of a binding\n\ncontract weakened Prisma Zona's claim for protection from political\n\ndiscrimination: \"Although a binding contract is not necessarily a\n\ncondition of First Amendment protection, it would give Prisma Zona\n\na much firmer basis in Supreme Court precedent to argue that it was\n\nprotected from a politically motivated refusal to deal, quite apart\n\nfrom its use as an independent basis for relief under local law.\"\n\nId. at 5.     Later, we restricted our holding recognizing the\n\ngovernment's policymaking interest to cases where the plaintiff had\n\nno binding contract:        \"Policymakers can be replaced, despite\n\nreliance, absent legal tenure or contract.\"           Id. at 8. Once the\n\ngovernment has entered a binding contract, its legitimate interest\n\nin preserving its freedom to disavow the contract is accordingly\n\ndiminished.\n\n          Here, Kortright and Remexcel have alleged a binding\n\ncontract, under which they have performed their part.               Given the\n\nprocedural posture of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, we need not decide\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fwhether the Municipality in fact has some legitimate policy-making\n\ninterest that should eventually be taken into account in deciding\n\nwhether it could refuse to pay debts on political grounds.        We need\n\nonly decide whether such an interest appears on the face of the\n\ncomplaint. See Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46 (1957) (\"[A]\n\ncomplaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim\n\nunless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set\n\nof facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to\n\nrelief.\"); Educadores Puertorriqueños en Accíon v. Hernández, 367\n\nF.3d 61, 66 (1st Cir. 2004). No legitimate governmental interest\n\ndoes so appear.\n\n          Since no governmental interest justifying discrimination\n\non the basis of political affiliation is stated in the complaint,\n\nthe case appears to be a routine First Amendment retaliation case.\n\nRemexcel and Kortright must plead that they engaged in protected\n\nassociation,   that   they   were   entitled   to   payment   under   their\n\ncontracts,   and   that   the   Municipality   denied   the   payment   in\n\nretaliation for their exercise of associational rights.         See Baker\n\nv. Coxe, 230 F.3d 470, 475 (1st Cir. 2000).           These elements are\n\nadequately pleaded in the complaint. We therefore must reverse the\n\ndismissal of the First Amendment retaliation claim.\n\n                                     B.\n\n          Remexcel and Kortright also contend that they have stated\n\na § 1983 claim for breach of their right to procedural due process\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fby virtue of the Municipality's failure to pay them amounts owing\n\nunder their contracts.      A claim of breach of contract by a state\n\nactor without \"any indication or allegation that the state would\n\nrefuse to remedy the plaintiffs' grievance should they demonstrate\n\na breach of contract under state law,\" Casey v. Depetrillo, 697\n\nF.2d 22, 23 (1st Cir. 1983) (per curiam), does not state a claim\n\nfor violation of the plaintiffs' right of procedural due process.\n\nIn Lujan v.

We hold that it does. Accordingly, we reverse the district court's dismissal of the First Amendment claims of Remexcel Managerial Consultants, Inc., and Maria S. Kortright arising under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983. We affirm the district court's dismissal of their due process claims and of all the claims asserted by Reinaldo Ram&#237;rez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because this suit was dismissed under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim, we review the district court's decision de novo and take the facts as pleaded in the complaint, drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs' favor. <i>Campagna v. Massachusetts Dep't of Envtl. Prot.,</i> 334 F.3d 150, 154 (1st Cir.2003). The complaint alleges that Ram&#237;rez and his company, Remexcel, entered into a contract with the Municipality of Guayanilla during the tenure of Mayor Ceferino Pacheco Guidicelli, who was a member of the New Progressive Party, or \"NPP.\" The contract called for Remexcel to provide accounting services that would identify taxpayers who had not paid taxes owed to the Municipality. Remexcel's compensation was to be ten percent of taxes successfully collected as a result of its efforts. Pursuant to the contract, Remexcel identified deficiencies in the amount of $4,444,058.87 owed by Stinnes Interoil to the Municipality for the tax years from 1992 to 1997. Following administrative proceedings in which Remexcel assisted the Municipality, the Municipality notified Stinnes of its final determination that Stinnes owed $4,419,100.28 in taxes and interest. Stinnes objected and filed a lawsuit in the Puerto Rico courts, <i>Veba Oil Supply v. Municipality of Guyanilla,</i> Civil No. JCO 96-0003 (Super.Ct.Ponce).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Municipality was obliged to hire counsel to defend the lawsuit. It hired Kortright under a contingency contract, which gave her the right to ten percent of the moneys collected as a result of her work. She worked on the litigation through the end of 2000, doing legal research, investigating the facts, and filing the summary judgment motions on which the suit was ultimately resolved. However, at the beginning of 2001, a new mayor, Edgardo Arlequ&#237;n, took office; Arlequ&#237;n is a member of the Popular Democratic Party, or \"PDP.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint alleges that Arlequ&#237;n began \"a pattern and practice of discrimination by taking adverse action against anyone associated with the prior New Progressive Party administration at any level.\" Arlequ&#237;n \"refused to continue any professional association with the Plaintiffs.\" Kortright was told to withdraw as counsel for the Municipality in the <i>Veba Oil</i> case, which she did on January 22, 2001. She was replaced with a new lawyer, who did nothing of record but enter his appearance before the court granted summary judgment to the Municipality in the amount of $4.5 million, based on Kortright's work. The new lawyer then settled the suit for $3 million dollars, of which $1.8 million was paid to the Municipality and $1.2 million was paid to a different municipality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint alleges that Arlequ&#237;n and the Municipality refused to pay Ram&#237;rez, Remexcel, and Kortright moneys which they had earned and to which they were entitled and that the only reason for the refusal was their association with the previous mayor. The complaint alleges causes of action under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 against the Municipality and against Arlequ&#237;n, individually and in his official capacity, for violation of Ram&#237;rez's, Remexcel's, and Kortright's First Amendment right of association and for deprivation of property without due process of law, as well as a claim for breach of contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arlequ&#237;n and the Municipality moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. The district court held that Ram&#237;rez lacked standing to assert a claim because the only injury was to Remexcel and Ram&#237;rez did not have standing to assert the corporation's claim. <i>Ram&#237;rez v. Arlequ&#237;n,</i> 357 F.Supp.2d 416, 421 (D.P.R. 2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court next considered whether Remexcel and Kortright were entitled to First Amendment protection against the termination of their contracts. Applying precedents governing termination of government employment, such as <i>Elrod v. Burns,</i> 427 U.S. 347, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976), and <i>Branti v. Finkel,</i> 445 U.S. 507, 100 S.Ct. 1287, 63 L.Ed.2d 574 (1980), the district court held that as a lawyer, Kortright occupied a confidential position and so was not entitled to protection from political firing. <i>Ram&#237;rez,</i> 357 F.Supp.2d at 421-24. The district court held that Remexcel's contract also involved policymaking, and so was not entitled to protection from political discrimination. <i>Id.</i> at 425. The district court stated that Kortright and Remexcel's claims for moneys earned were merely contract claims, not claims for political discrimination. <i>Id.</i> at 424-25. The district court dismissed Remexcel's and Kortright's procedural due process claims on the ground that they had no property interest in the proceeds of their contracts. <i>Id.</i> at 426-27. Their substantive due process claims were dismissed because they alleged neither conduct that shocked the conscience nor deprivation of the kind of interests \"actionable under the substantive modality of the due process clause.\" <i>Id.</i> at 427. Having dismissed the federal claims, the district court then declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the contract claim arising under Commonwealth law. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ram&#237;rez, Remexcel, and Kortright appeal the dismissal of their claims. However, Ram&#237;rez does not argue that the district court erred in holding that he lacked standing; we therefore consider him to have waived the argument, and we will consider the remaining arguments only with regard to Remexcel and Kortright.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Remexcel and Kortright argue that their complaint states a violation of substantive and procedural due process, as well as a violation of their First Amendment rights. In <i>Zinermon v. Burch,</i> 494 U.S. 113, 125, 110 S.Ct. 975, 108 L.Ed.2d 100 (1990), the Supreme Court identified three kinds of due process claims that can be asserted under &#167; 1983:(1) for violation of one of the substantive rights found in other provisions of the Constitution, such as the First Amendment; (2) for arbitrary, wrongful government actions, regardless of the fairness of the procedure used; and (3) for deprivation of life, liberty or property by unfair procedures. Remexcel and Kortright allege all three kinds of claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the doctrine of \"unconstitutional conditions,\" the government may not deny a benefit to a person on a basis that infringes the person's First Amendment rights. <i>Bd. of Comm'rs v. Umbehr,</i> 518 U.S. 668, 674, 116 S.Ct. 2342, 135 L.Ed.2d 843 (1996). Under the related doctrine of \"retaliation,\" the government may not impose burdens on persons in order to discourage or punish them from exercising protected constitutional rights. <i>See Powell v. Alexander,</i> 391 F.3d 1, 16-17 (1st Cir.2004) (citing <i>Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle,</i> 429 U.S. 274, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977)); <i>Rosenfeld v. Egy,</i> 346 F.3d 11, 15 (1st Cir. 2003). Generally, the government may not coerce persons into supporting a political party or punish them for exercising their right of association. <i>O'Hare Truck Serv., Inc. v. City of Northlake,</i> 518 U.S. 712, 721, 116 S.Ct. 2353, 135 L.Ed.2d 874 (1996) (\"[T]he government may not coerce support in this manner, unless it has some justification beyond dislike of the individual's political association.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The disputed question in this case is whether Remexcel and Kortright were entitled to First Amendment protection against retaliation for their affiliation with the former Mayor and the NPP. It might be tempting to view this case as just a breach of contract claim with no constitutional dimension. As discussed below, Remexcel's and Kortright's Fourteenth Amendment procedural due process claim fails because state contract remedies provide the requisite due process. Remexcel's and Kortright's First Amendment claim, on the other hand, is premised on a constitutionally proscribed reason for the alleged breach of contract-namely, the political affiliation of individuals claiming a right to payment for work already performed. Although we must always be concerned about constitutionalizing traditional common law claims, we see no theoretical bar to the First Amendment claim that is alleged here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a line of cases brought by government employees who were fired or penalized because of their political association, the Supreme Court held that there is no right to protection for political affiliation where political affiliation is legitimately relevant to the employee's job. <i>See Branti v. Finkel,</i> 445 U.S. 507, 100 S.Ct. 1287, 63 L.Ed.2d 574 (1980); <i>Elrod v. Burns,</i> 427 U.S. 347, 367-68, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976) (plurality). \"[I]f an employee's private political beliefs would interfere with the discharge of his public duties, his First Amendment rights may be required to yield to the State's vital interest in maintaining governmental effectiveness and efficiency.\" <i>Branti,</i> 445 U.S. at 517, 100 S.Ct. 1287. In <i>Elrod,</i> Justice Stewart's concurring opinion identified the kind of jobs that were protected from political discrimination as \"nonpolicymaking, nonconfidential\" government jobs. 427 U.S. at 375, 96 S.Ct. 2673. <i>Branti</i> clarified that the policymaking or confidential criteria are merely signposts for the real question of whether the government has a legitimate interest in using political persuasion in hiring and firing:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he ultimate inquiry is not whether the label \"policymaker\" or \"confidential\" fits a particular position; rather, the question is whether the hiring authority can demonstrate that party affiliation is an appropriate requirement for the effective performance of the public office involved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">445 U.S. at 518, 100 S.Ct. 1287.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that Remexcel and Kortright performed policymaking or confidential duties under their contracts with the Municipality, and that they were therefore not entitled to First Amendment protection against discrimination based on their political affiliation. <i>Ram&#237;rez,</i> 357 F.Supp.2d at 421-25. We must decide whether the exemption of \"policymakers\" from protection against political affiliation discrimination applies outside the government employment context to someone who is neither a government employee nor seeks a continuing relationship with the government, but who merely asks to be paid in accordance with a contract which that person has already performed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This circuit has held that the government's policymaking interest could override the First Amendment protection against political discrimination, even where the plaintiff was not a government employee. In <i>Prisma Zona Exploratoria de Puerto Rico, Inc. v. Calder&#243;n,</i> 310 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.2002), Prisma Zona had negotiated an agreement with two public corporations created by Puerto Rico for Prisma Zona to operate a children's museum; however, Prisma Zona had failed to obtain a final commitment from the corporations before an election brought in a new administration, allegedly hostile to Prisma Zona because of its political affiliation. The new administration refused to transfer the museum funds to Prisma Zona. Prisma Zona brought a &#167; 1983 suit alleging that the governor and others refused to transfer the assets to Prisma Zona because of its political affiliation and that this discrimination violated its First Amendment rights. <i>Id.</i> at 4. This court said the \"legal landscape\" for the claim was the <i>Elrod</i> line of cases. <i>Id.</i> at 4-5. Prisma Zona contended that the government could not decide against transferring the funds based on Prisma Zona's political affiliation, but we held it could, based on analogy to the government's right to fire policymakers for having the wrong political affiliation:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even in core cases involving politically motivated hirings and firings, the Supreme Court has itself recognized that a wholly antiseptic application of the <i>Elrod</i> principle is unrealistic. Instead, party affiliation <i>is</i> an appropriate consideration in hiring and firing decisions with respect to government positions that may be characterized as \"policymaking\" or \"confidential.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Prisma seeks to attack a set of decisions related to the possible privatization (whether to do so and through whom) of the operation of a children's museum and directing to it millions of dollars of public monies. Where policy choices of this magnitude are presented, courts ought not be second-guessing how much party politics in the narrower sense may also have played a role.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 7 (emphasis in original; citations omitted); <i>accord Walker v. City of Lakewood,</i> 272 F.3d 1114, 1132 (9th Cir.2001). Thus, in <i>Prisma Zona</i> we applied the policymaking exemption from First Amendment protection outside the government employment setting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even though the policymaking exemption can apply to non-employees, there remains an important distinction between Kortright and Remexcel, on the one hand, and Prisma Zona and the fired government employees, on the other. Prisma Zona and the fired employees sought a continuing relationship with the government that would hamstring the government's ability to change policy directions, while Remexcel and Kortright seek only payment for services already rendered. While the government has a legitimate interest in having employees who possess all the attributes necessary for their jobs, even, where appropriate, political attributes, here the government is not being asked to keep unqualified employees or contractors. Kortright and Remexcel were hired by a previous administration that considered them qualified, and they did their work for that administration; now, only the government's obligation of payment remains.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We suggested twice in <i>Prisma Zona</i> that the result might have been different if Prisma Zona had obtained a binding contract to operate the museum. First, we said that the lack of a binding contract weakened Prisma Zona's claim for protection from political discrimination: \"Although a binding contract is not necessarily a condition of First Amendment protection, it would give Prisma Zona a much firmer basis in Supreme Court precedent to argue that it was protected from a politically motivated refusal to deal, quite apart from its use as an independent basis for relief under local law.\" <i>Id.</i> at 5. Later, we restricted our holding recognizing the government's policymaking interest to cases where the plaintiff had no binding contract: \"Policymakers can be replaced, despite reliance, absent legal tenure or contract.\" <i>Id.</i> at 8. Once the government has entered a binding contract, its legitimate interest in preserving its freedom to disavow the contract is accordingly diminished.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Kortright and Remexcel have alleged a binding contract, under which they have performed their part. Given the procedural posture of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, we need not decide whether the Municipality in fact has some legitimate policy-making interest that should eventually be taken into account in deciding whether it could refuse to pay debts on political grounds. We need only decide whether such an interest appears on the face of the complaint. <i>See Conley v. Gibson,</i> 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957) (\"[A] complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\"); <i>Educadores Puertorrique&#241;os en Acc&#237;on v. Hern&#225;ndez,</i> 367 F.3d 61, 66 (1st Cir.2004). No legitimate governmental interest does so appear.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since no governmental interest justifying discrimination on the basis of political affiliation is stated in the complaint, the case appears to be a routine First Amendment retaliation case. Remexcel and Kortright must plead that they engaged in protected association, that they were entitled to payment under their contracts, and that the Municipality denied the payment in retaliation for their exercise of associational rights. <i>See Baker v. Coxe,</i> 230 F.3d 470, 475 (1st Cir.2000). These elements are adequately pleaded in the complaint. We therefore must reverse the dismissal of the First Amendment retaliation claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Remexcel and Kortright also contend that they have stated a &#167; 1983 claim for breach of their right to procedural due process by virtue of the Municipality's failure to pay them amounts owing under their contracts. A claim of breach of contract by a state actor without \"any indication or allegation that the state would refuse to remedy the plaintiffs' grievance should they demonstrate a breach of contract under state law,\" <i>Casey v. Depetrillo,</i> 697 F.2d 22, 23 (1st Cir.1983) (per curiam), does not state a claim for violation of the plaintiffs' right of procedural due process. In <i>Lujan v. G &amp; G Fire Sprinklers, Inc.,</i> 532 U.S. 189, 196-98, 121 S.Ct. 1446, 149 L.Ed.2d 391 (2001), the Supreme Court held that a claim for breach, under color of state law, of a contract to pay money would not support a due process claim unless state contract remedies were closed to the plaintiff. Kortright and Remexcel do not allege that there is no complete and adequate remedy available under state law for the breach of contract. The district court correctly dismissed their procedural due process claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kortright and Remexcel also invoke the doctrine of substantive due process in connection with the Municipality's political discrimination against them. Their substantive due process claim is coextensive with their First Amendment claim. Where the plaintiffs have stated a viable First Amendment claim for the very same conduct, we have declined to \"enter the uncharted thicket of substantive due process to find an avenue for relief.\" <i>Nestor Col&#243;n-Medina &amp; Sucesores, Inc. v. Custodio,</i> 964 F.2d 32, 46 (1st Cir.1992); <i>accord Rosenfeld v. Egy,</i> 346 F.3d 11, 15 (1st Cir.2003) (same when equal protection claim duplicates First Amendment claim).

The complaint alleges that Ram&#237;rez and his company, Remexcel, entered into a contract with the Municipality of Guayanilla during the tenure of Mayor Ceferino Pacheco Guidicelli, who was a member of the New Progressive Party, or \"NPP.\" The contract called for Remexcel to provide accounting services that would identify taxpayers who had not paid taxes owed to the Municipality. Remexcel's compensation was to be ten percent of taxes successfully collected as a result of its efforts. Pursuant to the contract, Remexcel identified deficiencies in the amount of $4,444,058.87 owed by Stinnes Interoil to the Municipality for the tax years from 1992 to 1997. Following administrative proceedings in which Remexcel assisted the Municipality, the Municipality notified Stinnes of its final determination that Stinnes owed $4,419,100.28 in taxes and interest. Stinnes objected and filed a lawsuit in the Puerto Rico courts, <i>Veba Oil Supply v.

She worked on the litigation through the end of 2000, doing legal research, investigating the facts, and filing the summary judgment motions on which the suit was ultimately resolved. However, at the beginning of 2001, a new mayor, Edgardo Arlequ&#237;n, took office; Arlequ&#237;n is a member of the Popular Democratic Party, or \"PDP.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint alleges that Arlequ&#237;n began \"a pattern and practice of discrimination by taking adverse action against anyone associated with the prior New Progressive Party administration at any level.\" Arlequ&#237;n \"refused to continue any professional association with the Plaintiffs.\" Kortright was told to withdraw as counsel for the Municipality in the <i>Veba Oil</i> case, which she did on January 22, 2001. She was replaced with a new lawyer, who did nothing of record but enter his appearance before the court granted summary judgment to the Municipality in the amount of $4.5 million, based on Kortright's work.

As discussed below, Remexcel's and Kortright's Fourteenth Amendment procedural due process claim fails because state contract remedies provide the requisite due process. Remexcel's and Kortright's First Amendment claim, on the other hand, is premised on a constitutionally proscribed reason for the alleged breach of contract-namely, the political affiliation of individuals claiming a right to payment for work already performed.

We must decide whether the exemption of \"policymakers\" from protection against political affiliation discrimination applies outside the government employment context to someone who is neither a government employee nor seeks a continuing relationship with the government, but who merely asks to be paid in accordance with a contract which that person has already performed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This circuit has held that the government's policymaking interest could override the First Amendment protection against political discrimination, even where the plaintiff was not a government employee.

Prisma Zona and the fired employees sought a continuing relationship with the government that would hamstring the government's ability to change policy directions, while Remexcel and Kortright seek only payment for services already rendered. While the government has a legitimate interest in having employees who possess all the attributes necessary for their jobs, even, where appropriate, political attributes, here the government is not being asked to keep unqualified employees or contractors. Kortright and Remexcel were hired by a previous administration that considered them qualified, and they did their work for that administration; now, only the government's obligation of payment remains.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We suggested twice in <i>Prisma Zona</i> that the result might have been different if Prisma Zona had obtained a binding contract to operate the museum. First, we said that the lack of a binding contract weakened Prisma Zona's claim for protection from political discrimination: \"Although a binding contract is not necessarily a condition of First Amendment protection, it would give Prisma Zona a much firmer basis in Supreme Court precedent to argue that it was protected from a politically motivated refusal to deal, quite apart from its use as an independent basis for relief under local law.\" <i>Id.</i> at 5. Later, we restricted our holding recognizing the government's policymaking interest to cases where the plaintiff had no binding contract: \"Policymakers can be replaced, despite reliance, absent legal tenure or contract.\" <i>Id.</i> at 8. Once the government has entered a binding contract, its legitimate interest in preserving its freedom to disavow the contract is accordingly diminished.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Kortright and Remexcel have alleged a binding contract, under which they have performed their part. Given the procedural posture of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, we need not decide whether the Municipality in fact has some legitimate policy-making interest that should eventually be taken into account in deciding whether it could refuse to pay debts on political grounds. We need only decide whether such an interest appears on the face of the complaint. <i>See Conley v.
