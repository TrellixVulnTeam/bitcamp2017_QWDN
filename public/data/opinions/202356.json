Nancy Gertner, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                    Torruella, Lynch, and Howard,\n                           Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Dana M. Gershengorn, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Seth P. Berman, Assistant United States Attorney, and Michael\nJ. Sullivan, United States Attorney, were on brief, for appellant.\n     Miriam Conrad, with whom Federal Defender Office was on brief,\nfor appellee.\n\n\n\n                           August 16, 2006\n\f            LYNCH, Circuit Judge.        This is the government's appeal\n\nfrom a pre-trial order by a district court excluding from jury\n\nconsideration three photographs, which the government has charged\n\nare child pornography.\n\n            In 2004, Rudy Frabizio was indicted on, inter alia, one\n\ncount of possession of child pornography, in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2252(a)(4)(B). That statute prohibits the knowing possession of:\n\n            1 or more books, magazines, periodicals,\n            films, video tapes, or other matter which\n            contain any visual depiction that has been\n            mailed, or has been shipped or transported in\n            interstate or foreign commerce, or which was\n            produced using materials which have been\n            mailed or so shipped or transported, by any\n            means including by computer, if --\n                   (i) the producing of such visual\n                   depiction involves the use of a minor\n                   engaging in sexually explicit conduct;\n                   and\n                   (ii) such visual depiction is of such\n                   conduct . . . .\n\n18 U.S.C. § 2252(a)(4)(B).        \"[S]exually explicit conduct\" is, in\n\nturn,    defined   as,   inter   alia,   \"lascivious     exhibition   of    the\n\ngenitals or pubic area of any person.\"           Id. § 2256(2)(A)(v).1\n\n            The government's filings state that Frabizio's former\n\nemployer,    the   Limbach   Company,      had   found   certain   images    on\n\nFrabizio's work computer and had terminated Frabizio for violating\n\ncompany rules concerning internet usage -- in particular, rules\n\n\n     1\n          The term \"sexually explicit conduct\" also includes other\nconduct -- sexual intercourse, bestiality, masturbation, and\nsadistic or masochistic abuse -- not relevant to this case. 18\nU.S.C. § 2256(2)(A)(i)-(iv).\n\n                                     -2-\n\fprohibiting the viewing of inappropriate websites.            FBI examiners\n\nthen found a number of images on Frabizio's work computer that\n\nformed   the   basis   for   his   indictment    for   possession   of   child\n\npornography.     In response to Frabizio's request for a bill of\n\nparticulars, the government identified nineteen specific images it\n\nintended to introduce at trial.\n\n           Frabizio moved to have the district court review the\n\nnineteen images before trial and to exclude from evidence those\n\nthat the court determined would not meet the legal definition of\n\n\"sexually explicit conduct.\"2          The government objected to the\n\nprocedure, arguing that such a preliminary review of the images\n\ninterfered with the jury's function.            The government also argued\n\nthat the standard to be applied if the court were to engage in such\n\na review should be whether a reasonable jury could find that an\n\nimage depicts \"sexually explicit conduct\" within the meaning of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 2256(2)(A).\n\n           On April 21, 2005, the district court granted Frabizio's\n\nrequest that it perform a preliminary review of the images in order\n\nto determine their admissibility. The court, as the government had\n\n\n     2\n          There is no dispute that the images were \"visual\ndepictions.\"   Frabizio argued only that those visual depictions\nwere not of \"sexually explicit conduct.\"\n          To obtain a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 2252(a)(4)(B),\nthe government must prove several elements independent of the\nrequirement that the visual depiction be of \"sexually explicit\nconduct,\" including the element that the visual depiction be\n\"knowingly possess[ed].\"   This case involves no question about\nthese other elements of the crime.\n\n                                     -3-\n\furged, adopted the standard of whether a reasonable jury could find\n\nthat the images depicted \"sexually explicit conduct\" in the form of\n\n\"lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area.\"\n\n                  At the hearing before the district court, the government\n\nexplained that it was prepared to present evidence that three of\n\nthe images, Exhibits 1, 2, and 3, were of \"known child victims.\"3\n\nThis evidence was significant because \"the government must prove\n\nthat       an    image    depicts       actual     children       to   sustain    a     .    .   .\n\nconviction\" under the statute.                   United States v. Hilton, 386 F.3d\n\n13, 18 (1st Cir. 2004) (per curiam) (citing Ashcroft v. Free Speech\n\nCoal.,          535   U.S.     234,    251-56    (2002)).           Frabizio   focused       his\n\nchallenge on those three images and one other. After examining the\n\nimages, and eschewing consideration of the circumstances in which\n\nthe    photographs           were     produced    or     of   any    other   evidence,       the\n\ndistrict court issued an order on May 9, 2005, in which it excluded\n\nfrom       evidence      the    three    images        of   the   putative     \"known       child\n\nvictims,\" Exhibits 1, 2, and 3, but agreed with the government that\n\nthe fourth challenged exhibit was admissible.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n          As to these three exhibits, the government said that it\nhad \"a witness . . . who has met the children [depicted in the\nthree photographs], knows that [the children were] between the ages\nof 10 and 12 when [the photographs] were taken, [and] knows that\nthey were lured to a remote location by a stream in Paraguay and\nmade to remove their clothing and [to] pose.\" In contrast, as to\nthe other sixteen images, the government stated that it would have\n\"to rely on the testimony of experts about whether or not the\nchildren involved are real.\"\n\n                                                 -4-\n\f               Utilizing the so-called \"Dost factors,\" see United States\n\nv. Dost, 636 F. Supp. 828, 832 (S.D. Cal. 1986), aff'd sub nom.\n\nUnited States v. Wiegand, 812 F.2d 1239 (9th Cir. 1987), the\n\ndistrict court concluded that no reasonable jury could conclude\n\nthat       Exhibits    1,    2,   or   3    met    the   statutory     requirement        of\n\n\"lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area.\"                            The court\n\nthen said it was excluding the images pursuant to Rule 104(a) of\n\nthe Federal Rules of Evidence.4               In a footnote, the court also said\n\nit would use Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence as an\n\nalternate basis for exclusion, because the government could rely on\n\nthe sixteen other images identified in its bill of particulars, and\n\nthus Exhibits 1, 2, and 3 would only be cumulative.\n\n               In     this   interlocutory         appeal,    over     which       we   have\n\njurisdiction          pursuant    to    18    U.S.C.     §   3731,     the    government\n\nchallenges      the     exclusion      of    the    three    images.         We    reverse,\n\ndisagreeing both with the district court's ultimate conclusion and\n\nwith the methodology of analysis that it used.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n          Rule    104(a)    merely   provides    for    preliminary\ndeterminations of admissibility.       See Fed. R. Evid. 104(a)\n(\"Preliminary questions concerning the qualification of a person to\nbe a witness, the existence of a privilege, or the admissibility of\nevidence shall be determined by the court . . . .\"). It does not\nin itself establish the correctness of the procedures used here.\n\n                                             -5-\n\f                                            I.\n\n           Exclusion of the Exhibits Under Fed. R. Evid. 104(a)\n\n               The question before us, as framed by the parties, is\n\nwhether a reasonable jury reviewing the three photographs could\n\nhave       concluded   that    they   met        the   statutory   requirement   of\n\n\"lascivious      exhibition     of    the    genitals     or   pubic   area.\"5   No\n\ndeference is owed to the district court's resolution of this\n\nquestion.       Indeed, this question, like one arising in the context\n\nof a challenge to the sufficiency of evidence supporting a jury's\n\nverdict, is one of which we engage in de novo review.                    Cf. United\n\nStates v. Rayl, 270 F.3d 709, 712 (8th Cir. 2001) (reviewing a\n\nsufficiency challenge to a jury verdict of guilty in a child\n\npornography case); cf. also United States v. Rivera Rangel, 396\n\nF.3d 476, 482 (1st Cir. 2005) (engaging in de novo review of\n\nsufficiency challenge); United States v. Pimental, 380 F.3d 575,\n\n583 (1st Cir. 2004) (same).           Also, our review of the meaning of the\n\nstatute is de novo.           See In re Pharmatrak, Inc., 329 F.3d 9, 19\n\n\n\n\n       5\n          This appeal did not come to us in the usual posture of\nappellate review of a district court's grant or denial of a motion\nfor a judgment of acquittal after the presentation of the\ngovernment's case. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 29; see also, e.g., United\nStates v. Rayl, 270 F.3d 709, 714-15 (8th Cir. 2001); United States\nv. Horn, 187 F.3d 781, 789-90 (8th Cir. 1999); United States v.\nMuick, 167 F.3d 1162, 1166 (7th Cir. 1999); United States v.\nVillard, 885 F.2d 117, 120-21 (3d Cir. 1989). The government has\nchosen not to challenge on appeal the procedure used by the\ndistrict court, so we do not decide the question of its\nappropriateness.\n\n                                         -6-\n\f(1st Cir. 2003); United States v. Horn, 187 F.3d 781, 789 (8th Cir.\n\n1999).\n\n           The statutory question before us must be placed in the\n\ncontext of Supreme Court's decision in New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S.\n\n747 (1982), which upheld against a First Amendment challenge a New\n\nYork statute criminalizing the distribution of child pornography.\n\nIn Ferber, the Court held that the New York statute served the\n\npurpose   of   \"prevention     of    sexual    exploitation   and     abuse   of\n\nchildren,\"     which    was   \"a    government    objective   of     surpassing\n\nimportance.\"     Id. at 757.       The Court recognized that \"the use of\n\nchildren as subjects of pornographic materials is harmful to the\n\nphysiological, emotional, and mental health of the child[ren].\"\n\nId. at 758.      The distribution of child pornography, the Court\n\nreasoned, \"is intrinsically related to the sexual abuse of children\n\nin at least two ways\":             \"First, the materials produced are a\n\npermanent record of the children's participation and the harm to\n\nthe child[ren] is exacerbated by their circulation.                 Second, the\n\ndistribution network for child pornography must be closed if the\n\nproduction of material which requires the sexual exploitation of\n\nchildren is to be effectively controlled.\"             Id. at 759 (footnote\n\nomitted); see also Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U.S. 103, 110-11 (1990)\n\n(upholding     the     prohibition    on     private   possession    of   child\n\npornography for these same reasons, among others).\n\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\f           Because of the \"particular and more compelling interest\n\nin   prosecuting   those   who   promote    the   sexual   exploitation   of\n\nchildren,\" the Court held that all child pornography -- even that\n\nwhich is not obscene under the standard set forth in Miller v.\n\nCalifornia, 413 U.S. 15 (1973) -- is outside the scope of the First\n\nAmendment and can be banned.        Ferber, 458 U.S. at 761; see also\n\nFree Speech Coal., 535 U.S. at 240 (\"As a general rule, pornography\n\ncan be banned only if obscene, but under Ferber, pornography\n\nshowing minors can be proscribed whether or not the images are\n\nobscene . . . .\").\n\n           Importantly for our case, the Supreme Court also held in\n\nFerber   that   laws   banning    child    pornography     withstand   First\n\nAmendment scrutiny so long as \"the conduct to be prohibited [is]\n\nadequately defined by the applicable . . . law, as written or\n\nauthoritatively construed\"; the material prohibited \"involve[s]\n\nlive performance or photographic or other visual reproduction of\n\nlive performances\"; and \"criminal responsibility [is not] imposed\n\nwithout some element of scienter on the part of the defendant.\"\n\nFerber, 458 U.S. at 764-65.      The Court then looked to the New York\n\nstatute, which prohibited the distribution of material depicting\n\n\"sexual conduct,\" which was statutorily defined as, inter alia,\n\n\"lewd exhibition of the genitals.\"         The Court concluded this was a\n\ndefinition which did not offend the First Amendment.            See id. at\n\n765, 773-74.\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\f                  The Supreme Court went beyond that.          It also observed\n\nthat the term \"lewd exhibition of the genitals\" was a known\n\nquantity in this area of law, and that it \"was given in Miller as\n\nan example of a permissible regulation.\"                     Id. at 765 (citing\n\nMiller, 413 U.S. at 25); see also Osborne, 495 U.S. at 114.\n\n                  The language of the federal statute under consideration\n\nin this case is virtually the same as that upheld in Ferber as an\n\nadequate definition in light of First Amendment concerns.6                  In 18\n\nU.S.C. § 2256(2)(A), the word \"lascivious\" replaces the word\n\n\"lewd,\" as was used by the New York statute upheld in Ferber.\n\nMoreover, the federal prohibition extends beyond \"the genitals\" to\n\nthe \"pubic area.\"7          The Courts of Appeals have uniformly treated\n\nthe terms \"lewd\" and \"lascivious\" as materially equivalent.                  See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Adams, 343 F.3d 1024, 1035 (9th Cir. 2003)\n\n(\"We       hold    that   the   statute   at    issue   in   Ferber   is   legally\n\n\n\n       6\n          The New York statute under consideration in Ferber\ndefined \"sexual conduct\" in terms almost identical to the\ndefinition of \"sexually explicit conduct\" set forth in 18 U.S.C. §\n2256(2)(A).    See N.Y. Penal Law § 263.00(3) (McKinney 1980)\n(\"'Sexual conduct' means actual or simulated sexual intercourse,\ndeviate sexual intercourse, sexual bestiality, masturbation,\nsado-masochistic abuse, or lewd exhibition of the genitals.\").\n       7\n          The federal child pornography statute also used the term\n\"lewd\" until 1984, when Congress substituted in the word\n\"lascivious\" to \"make it clear that an exhibition of a child's\ngenitals does not have to meet the obscenity standard to be\nunlawful.\"   Dost, 636 F. Supp. at 831 (quoting 130 Cong. Rec.\nS3510, S3511 (daily ed. Mar. 30, 1984) (statement of Rep.\nSpecter)); see also United States v. Freeman, 808 F.2d 1290, 1292\n(8th Cir. 1987).\n\n                                          -9-\n\findistinguishable from 18 U.S.C. § 2256(2)(A). . . . [T]his court\n\nhas equated 'lascivious' with 'lewd.'\"                 (citing Wiegand, 812 F.2d\n\nat 1243)); United States v. Reedy, 845 F.2d 239, 241 (10th Cir.\n\n1988).      The Supreme Court has itself endorsed this position.                        See\n\nUnited States v. X-Citement Video, Inc. (X-Citement Video II), 513\n\nU.S. 64, 78-79 (1994) (approving of United States v. X-Citement\n\nVideo, Inc., 982 F.2d 1285, 1288 (9th Cir. 1992), rev'd on other\n\ngrounds, X-Citement Video II, 513 U.S. 64).                    The addition of the\n\nterm \"pubic area\" has independent significance in that it broadens\n\nthe class of exhibitions that may be prohibited.\n\n                \"Lascivious\" is a \"commonsensical term,\" and whether a\n\ngiven depiction is lascivious is a question of fact for the jury.\n\nWiegand, 812 F.2d at 1243; see also Rayl, 270 F.3d at 714 (\"[T]he\n\nquestion whether materials depict 'lascivious exhibition of the\n\ngenitals,' an element of the crime, is for the finder of fact.\");\n\nReedy,      845      F.2d   at   241    (\"This    [c]ourt   agrees    .   .    .    that\n\n'lascivious' is . . . a commonsensical term . . . .\"                      (internal\n\nquotation mark omitted) (quoting Wiegand, 812 F.2d at 1243)).\n\nIndeed, \"[t]here is a consensus among the courts that whether the\n\nitem       to   be    judged     is    lewd,     lascivious,   or    obscene       is     a\n\ndetermination that lay persons can and should make.\"8                          United\n\n\n\n       8\n          For this reason, expert testimony is not required on the\nsubject. See United States v. Arvin, 900 F.2d 1385, 1390 (9th Cir.\n1990). There is, at the same time, no general rule that it is\nprohibited.\n\n                                           -10-\n\fStates v. Arvin, 900 F.2d 1385, 1390 (9th Cir. 1990); see also id.\n\n(citing cases).        The courts are also in agreement that the term\n\n\"lascivious\" is sufficiently well defined to provide persons \"of\n\nreasonable     intelligence,         guided          by    common    understanding       and\n\npractices,\"        notice     of     what        is       permissible     and    what     is\n\nimpermissible.

Ferber, 458\n\nU.S.   at    765    (holding        that       the    New     York   statute     was     not\n\nunconstitutionally          underinclusive,               because    it   \"sufficiently\n\ndescribes a category of material the production and distribution of\n\nwhich is not entitled to First Amendment protection\").\n\n            Subject to motions under Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of\n\nCriminal Procedure, it is up to the jury to determine whether the\n\nimages identified in the bill of particulars as a basis for an\n\nindictment     under    18    U.S.C.       §     2252(a)(4)(B)       constitute      visual\n\ndepictions of \"sexually explicit conduct,\" defined as \"lascivious\n\nexhibition     of    the     genitals       or    pubic      area\"    under     18   U.S.C.\n\n§ 2256(2)(A)(v).       In making this determination, the standard to be\n\napplied by the jury is the statutory standard.                            The statutory\n\n\n                                            -11-\n\fstandard needs no adornment. The Supreme Court has made clear that\n\nthe Constitution does not require additional glossing or narrowing\n\nof the standard, see Ferber, 458 U.S. at 765; cf. id. at 764 (\"A\n\ntrier of fact need not find that the material appeals to the\n\nprurient interest of the average person; it is not required that\n\nsexual conduct portrayed be done so in a patently offensive manner;\n\nand the material at issue need not be considered as a whole.\"), and\n\nCongress has chosen not to employ any additional glossing. Further\n\ndefinitional   guides   are   not   required   and,    indeed,   would   be\n\nprohibited if they functioned to narrow the statutory definition.9\n\n          Using   the   statutory     standard   and    asking whether a\n\nreasonable jury could conclude that Exhibits 1, 2, and 3 met the\n\nstandard, this panel has reviewed the disputed images and has\n\nconcluded that a reasonable jury could decide that the three\n\nphotographs constitute lascivious exhibitions of the genitals or\n\npubic area within meaning of the statute.\n\n\n\n\n     9\n           In other areas, this court has cautioned against judicial\nattempts to clarify commonsensical standards that the jury is well\nequipped to interpret and apply. For example, we have held that\nthe phrase \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" \"need[s] no defining or\nrefining.\" United States v. Campbell, 874 F.2d 838, 843 (1st Cir.\n1989).    Accordingly, we have warned that \"[m]ost efforts at\nclarification result in further obfuscation of the concept,\" and\nthat any judicial gloss on the phrase that \"reduce[s] the burden of\nproof on the government by expanding the degree of doubt\npermissible\" would be prohibited. Id.; see also United States v.\nGibson, 726 F.2d 869, 874 (1st Cir. 1984) (\"[A]ny attempt to define\n'reasonable doubt' will probably trigger a constitutional\nchallenge.\").\n\n                                    -12-\n\f           We describe how a reasonable jury could view the three\n\nexhibits under consideration, with full recognition that a thousand\n\nwords are not necessarily worth a picture.         Each of the three\n\nphotographs depicts a nude girl, who is posed alone and who is\n\nlooking directly at the camera.     Each girl appears on the cusp of\n\npuberty, either prepubescent or adolescent.      The subjects of the\n\nphotographs, who are of an age when girls normally are clothed even\n\nwhen in nature or in a stream, are completely unclothed (except for\n\nsome jewelry), and the settings of the photographs provide no ready\n\nexplanation that makes the nudity indisputably innocent. Moreover,\n\nin each photograph, a jury could reasonably conclude that there was\n\nan \"exhibition\" of the \"pubic area\": each of the girls' legs are\n\nparted and the pubic area is plainly visible.      Indeed, the photos\n\ncould reasonably be seen as focusing on or particularly drawing\n\nattention to the girls' pubic areas and, specifically, to their\n\nvaginas.   A jury could reasonably conclude that none of the girls'\n\npostures   were   natural   or   spontaneous,   that   each   girl   was\n\ndeliberately posed to exhibit her pubic area, and that the posture\n\nin which each was posed was not a comfortable one.      As a jury will\n\nconsider the images, we think the wisest course is to avoid more\n\ndetailed description of them.\n\n           In light of the criteria under the statute and the\n\nconstitutional limits set by Ferber, and our own review of the\n\nexhibits, we conclude that a reasonable jury could find that the\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fthree   photographs   constitute    \"lascivious     exhibitions     of   the\n\ngenitals or pubic area\" within the meaning of the statute, and that\n\nthe district court erred in taking the evidence away from the jury.\n\n                                   II.\n\n           Difficulties with the Analytical Methodology\n                  and the Use of the Dost Factors\n\n           Having   held   that   the    district   court   erred   in   its\n\ndetermination, under Rule 104(a), that no reasonable jury could\n\nfind these images to be a lascivious display of the genitals or\n\npubic area, we also express concern about the approach that the\n\ndistrict court took in reaching its decision -- an approach that,\n\nwe recognize, was urged upon the court by the parties.                    In\n\nexcluding the three exhibits, the court analyzed the question of\n\nwhether to exclude the evidence almost exclusively in terms of the\n\nDost factors, and, in our view, overemphasized those factors in a\n\nway which raised the risk of inappropriately limiting the statute.\n\n           This court has described the Dost factors as follows:\n\n           (1) whether the genitals or pubic area are the\n           focal point of the image; (2) whether the\n           setting of the image is sexually suggestive\n           (i.e., a location generally associated with\n           sexual activity); (3) whether the child is\n           depicted in an unnatural pose or inappropriate\n           attire considering her age; (4) whether the\n           child is fully or partially clothed, or nude;\n           (5) whether the image suggests sexual coyness\n           or willingness to engage in sexual activity;\n           and (6) whether the image is intended or\n           designed to elicit a sexual response in the\n           viewer.\n\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fUnited States v. Amirault, 173 F.3d 28, 31 (1st Cir. 1999) (citing\n\nDost, 636 F. Supp. at 832).\n\n           In Amirault, this court gave a qualified endorsement of\n\nthe Dost factors, stating that they are \"generally relevant and\n\nprovide some guidance.\"    Id. at 32.         We did not, however, suggest\n\nthat the Dost factors were the equivalent of -- or established the\n\nlimits of -- the statutory term \"lascivious.\"              Indeed, we reached\n\nthe opposite conclusion: \"[w]e emphasize[d] . . . that these\n\nfactors are neither comprehensive nor necessarily applicable in\n\nevery situation\" and that \"[t]he inquiry will always be case-\n\nspecific.\"    Id.; see also United States v. Hilton, 257 F.3d 50, 57\n\n(1st   Cir.   2001)   (warning    that       the   Dost   factors,    \"although\n\n'generally    relevant,'    are        not    comprehensive[,]        and   each\n\ndetermination of whether an image contains a lascivious display is\n\nnecessarily case specific\" (quoting Amirault, 173 F.3d at 32)).\n\n           In this case, the district court's analysis, although\n\nreciting the above language, in fact gave the Dost factors greater\n\nweight than warranted.         The court appeared to treat the Dost\n\nfactors as exhaustive and to use them to set the boundaries of the\n\nstatutory term \"lascivious.\"          The court thus applied the six Dost\n\nfactors in a way that accorded to them the same status as the\n\nstatutory definition itself.\n\n           The   consequence     of    the   district     court's    unqualified\n\napplication of the Dost factors was to take the issue of the\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\flasciviousness of the three images away from a jury.       None of the\n\ncases in which this court has referred to the Dost factors raised\n\nsuch a prospect.10     In Amirault, for example, the issue on appeal\n\nwas whether the district court had properly increased the sentence,\n\nunder the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, of a defendant who had\n\npleaded guilty to one count of possession of child pornography, by\n\napplying a cross-reference that resulted in a higher base-offense\n\nlevel if the crime involved trafficking in visual depictions of\n\nlascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of a minor.\n\n173 F.3d at 30-31.       In Amirault, the task of interpreting and\n\napplying the Sentencing Guidelines was for the court, and any close\n\n\"judgment calls\" -- and we noted that there were some -- were the\n\ncourt's to make.     Id. at 35.   Indeed, the particular image on which\n\nthe trafficking cross-reference was predicated was not one that had\n\nformed the basis of the conviction.       Id. at 30.\n\n          No other circuit court, as best we can tell, has ever\n\napproved the use of the Dost factors in a pretrial proceeding to\n\n\n\n     10\n          See Hilton, 257 F.3d at 57-58 (reinforcing the limited\nand qualified use of the Dost factors, and concluding, on de novo\nreview of a sentencing determination, that certain images were not\nlascivious); United States v. Brunette, 256 F.3d 14, 17-18 (1st\nCir. 2001) (using the Dost factors in evaluating the existence of\nprobable cause for a warrant); United States v. Nolan, 818 F.2d\n1015, 1019 n.5 (1st Cir. 1987) (describing the Dost factors without\napplying them or endorsing them).\n          As should be clear from our earlier discussion, if the\nDost factors were viewed, contrary to the law of this circuit, as\nbeing co-extensive with the statute, then the district court\nnevertheless erred.\n\n                                   -16-\n\fremove the consideration of the lasciviousness of an image from a\n\njury.11\n\n            There are many reasons for the need for caution about the\n\nuse of the Dost factors, particularly in this way.                 First is the\n\nfact that the Dost factors have fostered myriad disputes that have\n\nled courts far afield from the statutory language. One dispute is,\n\nfor example, how many of the factors must be present in an image\n\nfor it to qualify as \"lascivious.\"12        Compare, e.g., United States\n\nv. Wolf, 890 F.2d 241, 245 & n.6 (10th Cir. 1989) (\"We do not hold\n\nthat more than one Dost factor must be present . . . .\"), with\n\nUnited    States   v.   Villard,   885   F.2d   117,   122   (3d    Cir.   1989)\n\n(\"Although more than one factor must be present in order to\n\nestablish 'lasciviousness,' all six factors need not be present.\").\n\nAnother dispute is about what the specific factors mean.                   See,\n\ne.g., Amirault, 173 F.3d at 34 (cataloging disagreement about what\n\nthe sixth Dost factor means).        As one commentator observed, \"the\n\n\n     11\n          Indeed, only one circuit court has even suggested -- in\ndicta -- that a district court should conduct a preliminary review\nof images before they are submitted to a jury, and even then only\nwhere there was \"potential prejudice in allowing the government to\nintroduce and submit to the jury a large volume of materials that\nare prurient but non-obscene along with a few materials that could\nproperly be found to be child pornography.\" Rayl, 270 F.3d at 714.\nRayl did not mention the Dost factors. Instead, it indicated that\nthe appropriate standard was the statutory standard of \"lascivious\nexhibition of the genitals or pubic area.\" Id.\n     12\n          In fact, this was precisely one of the disputes that\narose in this case. The government had argued before the district\ncourt that the court should send an image to the jury so long as it\nfound that at least one Dost factor was present.\n\n                                    -17-\n\fDost test has produced a profoundly incoherent body of case law.\"\n\nA. Adler, Inverting the First Amendment, 149 U. Pa. L. Rev. 921,\n\n953 (2001).    There is every reason to avoid importing unnecessary\n\ninterpretive   conundrums   into   a   statute,   especially   where   the\n\nstatute employs terms that lay people are perfectly capable of\n\nunderstanding.\n\n           Even more significantly, there is a risk that the Dost\n\nfactors will be used to inappropriately limit the scope of the\n\nstatutory definition.13     That is impermissible.        We offer two\n\nexamples in which such a risk has been raised.\n\n           The first example is one that was noted by the Ninth\n\nCircuit when affirming one of the convictions in the Dost case.         In\n\nUnited States v. Wiegand, 812 F.2d 1239, the Ninth Circuit noted\n\nthat the Dost factors were \"over-generous to the defendant.\"           Id.\n\nat 1244.   Specifically, the court took issue with the fifth factor\n\narticulated by the district court: \"whether the visual depiction\n\nsuggests sexual coyness or a willingness to engage in sexual\n\nactivity.\"     Dost, 636 F. Supp. at 832.          The appellate court\n\nexpressed disapproval at \"[t]he standard employed by the district\n\ncourt[, which] . . . impl[ied] . . . that the pictures would not be\n\nlascivious unless they showed sexual activity or willingness to\n\n\n     13\n          Most cases endorsing Dost do so against attacks by the\ndefendant, fearful the Dost factors will expand the statutory term.\nThis case arises in a different posture. Here the government has\nobjected to the use made by the district court of the Dost factors\nas limiting the scope of the statutory term.\n\n                                   -18-\n\fengage in it.\"    Wiegand, 812 F.2d at 1244.          Emphasizing that \"[t]he\n\noffense defined by the statute is depiction of a 'lascivious\n\nexhibition of the genitals,'\" the appellate court held that it was\n\nenough that \"the pictures were an exhibition,\" \"[t]he exhibition\n\nwas of the genitals,\" and \"[e]ach of the pictures featured the\n\nchild photographed as a sexual object.\"              Id.\n\n           It is obvious that if an image does depict a sexually\n\nalluring look from the minor, it will be easier to show that the\n\nimage is lascivious. The absence of a sexual come-on, though, does\n\nnot mean that an image is not lascivious, as Wiegand and other\n\ncases have noted.        See, e.g., United States v. Knox, 32 F.3d 733,\n\n747 (3d Cir. 1994) (\"Children posing for pornographic pictures may\n\nsuffer dramatic harm regardless of whether they have an 'adult'\n\nlook of sexual invitation or coyness on their face.\"); Wolf, 890\n\nF.2d at 247 (noting that \"a sexually exploitative photograph of a\n\nchild need not portray the victim in a pose that 'depicts lust,\n\nwantonness, sexual coyness or other inappropriate precocity'\").\n\nChildren   do   not   characteristically       have    countenances    inviting\n\nsexual activity, and the statute does not presume that they do.               By\n\nsuggesting that the child subject must exhibit sexual coyness in\n\norder for an image to be lascivious, the district court in Dost ran\n\nthe risk of limiting the statute.\n\n           A    second    example   of   how   the    Dost   factors   may   risk\n\nlimiting the statute manifested itself in this case. In its order,\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\fthe district court overread Amirault as holding that a jury, in\n\ndetermining   whether    a   given   image     constitutes    a    \"lascivious\n\nexhibition    of   the   genitals    or     pubic   area,\"   is    limited   to\n\nconsidering \"the objective criteria of the photograph's design,\"\n\nAmirault, 173 F.3d at 35 -- what the district court called \"the\n\nfour corners of the image\" -- and nothing else.14                 The district\n\ncourt erred in stating that this court has adopted a general \"four\n\ncorners rule.\"     Amirault did not adopt such a rule,15 and the text\n\nof the statute itself does not require it.\n\n\n\n     14\n          The district court also noted that \"Frabizio argued that\nany information as to the purpose for which the photographs were\ntaken is hearsay.\"     To the extent the court relied on this\nalternative reasoning, we note that Fed. R. Evid. 104(a) explicitly\nprovides that \"[i]n making its determination [of admissibility of\nevidence, the court] is not bound by the rules of evidence except\nthose with respect to privileges.\"\n     15\n          The language in Amirault to which the district court\ncited in support of its view came in the context of Amirault's\nconstruction of the sixth Dost factor -- that of intent to elicit\na sexual response.     Amirault did not express a general rule\nlimiting the question of lasciviousness to the four corners of the\nphotograph.    It only expressed doubt about the government's\nargument in that case that the court should take into account the\nsubjective intent of the producer or the subjective reaction of the\nviewer of the image when deciding whether a particular depiction\nmeets the sixth Dost factor. See id. at 34 (registering \"serious\ndoubts that focusing upon the intent of the deviant photographer is\nany more objective than focusing upon a pedophile-viewer's\nreaction,\" and noting that \"a focus on the photograph's use seems\ninconsistent with the statute's purpose of protecting the child\").\nAmirault's commentary was on different issues, and it did not\nexclude from consideration any evidence that the subjects of the\ndepictions were known child victims who were exploited in the\nprocess of making the photographs. In fact, Amirault explicitly\nobserved as to the image under consideration that \"the\ncircumstances of the photograph's creation are unknown.\" Id.\n\n                                     -20-\n\f           The issue of the four corners rule, and even of what it\n\nmeans, has not been decided by this circuit, and we do not decide\n\nit here.   The issue is complicated, and there are arguments going\n\ndifferent ways.       For example, it is clear that the jury may hear\n\nevidence about the circumstances of the production of an image in\n\ndetermining whether the child depicted therein is real.                   It is\n\narguable that a jury should not be precluded from considering such\n\nevidence on the question of lasciviousness as well.                  The laws\n\nprohibiting possession of child pornography are constitutional\n\nbecause the government has a compelling interest in preventing\n\nsexual exploitation of children; it is not obvious that a jury\n\ncannot consider evidence of exactly that exploitation in evaluating\n\nthe lasciviousness of the materials.          Cf. Free Speech Coal., 535\n\nU.S. at 254 (\"In the case of the material covered by Ferber, the\n\ncreation   of   the    speech   is   itself   the   crime   of    child   abuse\n\n. . . .\"); see also id. at 250 (noting that \"speech [that] had what\n\nthe Court in effect held was a proximate link to the crime from\n\nwhich it came\" was not constitutionally protected).              But there are\n\nalso arguments, usually made in the context of the very different\n\nquestion of whether the subjective reaction or intent of the viewer\n\nshould be taken into account when determining whether an image is\n\nlascivious, that lasciviousness should be determined from the image\n\nalone.   Cf. Villard, 885 F.2d at 125 (holding, in the context of a\n\nsufficiency-of-the-evidence challenge to a jury verdict, that in\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\fevaluating the question of an image's lasciviousness, \"[w]e must\n\n. . . look at the photograph, rather than the viewer,\" because if\n\n\"we were to conclude that the photographs were lascivious merely\n\nbecause Villard found them sexually arousing, we would be engaging\n\nin conclusory bootstrapping\").\n\n              The issue, however, has not been squarely presented to us\n\nin this case.16 We flag it only to express concern that in deriving\n\nsuch a prohibition from Dost or from a misunderstanding of our case\n\nlaw, the district court ran the risk of impermissibly narrowing the\n\nscope of the statute by imposing upon the statute a limitation that\n\nwas in no way compelled by the statutory text itself.\n\n              We stress that our holding today is limited: We do not\n\nhold that the Dost factors may never be used.           We hold only that\n\nthey    are    not   the   equivalent   of   the   statutory   standard   of\n\n\"lascivious exhibition\" and are not to be used to limit the\n\nstatutory standard.17\n\n\n\n\n       16\n           The government had argued before the district court that\ntestimony that a child was exploited in the process of creating an\nimage provides objective evidence that the picture was taken for\nthe purpose of child pornography and is thus evidence that a jury\nought to be able to consider in determining whether a photograph is\nobjectively lascivious.\n       17\n          The concurring opinion states that our position is\nincompatible with this court's prior decision in Amirault. To the\ncontrary, our holding is not just consistent with, but takes as its\nstarting point, Amirault's holding that the Dost \"factors are\nneither comprehensive nor necessarily applicable in every\nsituation.\" 173 F.3d at 32.\n\n                                    -22-\n\f                                       III.\n\n           Exclusion of Exhibits Under Fed.

Evid. 403, holding that the\n\nthree images were cumulative in that the government could rely on\n\nthe sixteen other images identified in its bill of particulars.\n\n           Although Rule 403 \"enables a trial judge to exclude\n\nneedlessly cumulative evidence,\" it also \"requires a balance of\n\nprobative value against the negative consequences of using a\n\nparticular piece of evidence.\" Sec'y of Labor v. DeSisto, 929 F.2d\n\n789, 794-95 (1st Cir. 1991).

Roberts, 978 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir.\n\n1992)).\n\n           Here,      the   district    court    abused      its   discretion    by\n\nfailing, as required by Rule 403, to properly weigh its concerns\n\nabout cumulativeness against the probative value of the evidence.\n\n\n                                       -23-\n\fIn fact, the court did not even comment directly on the probative\n\nvalue of the three exhibits; it merely quoted the conclusion of the\n\ndistrict court in United States v. Dean, 135 F. Supp. 2d 207 (D.\n\nMe. 2001), that the \"four nonessential, questionable photos [in\n\nthat case were] not particularly probative.\"       Id. at 211.     The\n\nthree images at issue in this case were the only ones for which the\n\ngovernment was prepared to introduce evidence that the girls\n\ndepicted therein were known child victims; to satisfy its burden to\n\nshow that the sixteen other images were of real minors, the\n\ngovernment would have to call on experts to testify.\n\n          Having   failed   to   undertake   properly   the   balancing\n\nrequired by Rule 403, the district court abused its discretion in\n\nexcluding the images under that rule.\n\n                                  IV.\n\n          We reverse the district court's exclusion of the three\n\nimages; we hold they are admissible in evidence.          The case is\n\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n                       Concurrence follows.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -24-\n\f          TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge, concurring in the judgment.     I\n\nagree with the majority that the district court erred in excluding\n\nthe three images from evidence.         I write separately because I\n\ndisagree with the majority's analysis and also because the majority\n\ndoes not give due weight to circuit precedent.      I first present my\n\nown analysis for excluding the three images and second note my\n\ndisagreements with the majority's analysis.\n\n    I.   Exclusion of the Exhibits Under Fed. R. Evid. 104(a)\n\n          As ably described in the majority opinion, Congress has\n\nmade it a crime to possess visual depictions of minors engaging in\n\nsexually explicit conduct.     18 U.S.C. § 2252(a)(4)(B).    The term\n\n\"sexually explicit conduct\" includes the \"lascivious exhibition of\n\nthe genitals or pubic area.\"    Id. § 2256(2)(A).    Congress did not\n\nfurther define the term \"lascivious.\"\n\n          Finding that more guidance was necessary, the district\n\ncourt in United States v. Dost enumerated a list of factors to\n\nconsider in determining whether a picture lasciviously exhibits the\n\ngenitals or pubic area.   636 F. Supp. 828, 832 (S.D. Cal. 1986),\n\naff'd sub nom. United States v. Wiegand, 812 F.2d 1239, 1244 (9th\n\nCir. 1987). Several circuits, including ours, have referred to the\n\nDost factors in considering whether images lasciviously exhibit the\n\ngenitals or pubic area.   See United States v. Amirault, 173 F.3d\n\n28, 31 (1st Cir. 1999) (citing cases).       While we found that the\n\nDost factors were generally relevant and provided guidance, our\n\n\n                                 -25-\n\fembrace of them was only equivocal.      Id. at 32.    We found that the\n\nfactors \"are neither comprehensive nor necessarily applicable in\n\nevery situation\" and that \"there may be other factors that are\n\nequally if not more important in determining whether a photograph\n\ncontains a lascivious exhibition.\"       Id.\n\n          Before considering whether a reasonable jury could find\n\nthe three images lascivious, I wish to note several background\n\nprinciples relevant to our analysis.           First, I believe that an\n\nimportant consideration, which was not directly addressed by Dost\n\nnor by the district court, is whether the production or existence\n\nof the picture is harmful to the depicted child.            Clearly, the\n\nprotection of children from sexual exploitation is \"a government\n\nobjective of surpassing importance.\"      New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S.\n\n747, 757 (1982).    The victims of child pornography can be harmed\n\nnot only by the production of the pornography but also by the\n\ncontinued existence of the pornography on the Internet. See id. at\n\n759-60 & n.10.    Furthermore, the existence of the pornography can\n\nbe harmful to the child even if its production was not (e.g., if\n\nphotographs were surreptitiously taken).\n\n          In     passing   and   amending      laws   prohibiting   child\n\npornography, Congress has clearly been concerned with protecting\n\nchildren from harm.    See Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996,\n\nPub. L. No. 104-208, § 121, 110 Stat. 3009, 3009-26 (1996) (finding\n\nthat child pornography \"is a form of sexual abuse which can result\n\n\n                                  -26-\n\fin   physical   or    psychological     harm,   or   both,    to    the    children\n\ninvolved.\"); Child Abuse Victims' Rights Act of 1986, Pub. L. No.\n\n99-591, 100 Stat. 3341-74 (1986) (recognizing \"the physiological,\n\npsychological,       and   emotional    harm    caused   by   the     production,\n\ndistribution, and display of child pornography by strengthening\n\nlaws prescribing such activity\"); Child Protection Act of 1984,\n\nPub. L. No. 98-292, 98 Stat. 204 (1984) (finding that \"the use of\n\nchildren as subjects of pornographic materials is harmful to the\n\nphysiological, emotional, and mental health of the individual child\n\nand to society\").          The government is prosecuting Defendant for\n\nviolating 18 U.S.C. § 2252.              This statute is titled \"Certain\n\nactivities relating to material involving the sexual exploitation\n\nof minors\" and is under the chapter titled \"SEXUAL EXPLOITATION AND\n\nOTHER ABUSE OF CHILDREN.\"\n\n           It is my belief that Congress intended that the perceived\n\nharm to the depicted child by the production or existence of the\n\npicture be an essential factor in determining whether a picture\n\nlasciviously depicts the genitals or pubic area.                   While the Dost\n\nfactors address the harm to the child in an oblique manner, I\n\ninstead put the harm at the forefront of the analysis.                           See\n\nAmirault, 173 F.3d at 32 (stating that the Dost factors \"are\n\nneither   comprehensive        nor     necessarily    applicable          in   every\n\nsituation\").    To the extent that the Dost factors address the harm\n\nto the child, they will be relevant to my analysis.\n\n\n                                       -27-\n\f            The notion of what depictions are harmful to the child\n\ncannot help but be informed by cultural norms.             While the act of\n\nexploiting a child is harmful by definition, certain displays of\n\nnudity   may    be     harmful     solely    because   they     are     socially\n\nunacceptable.        These social norms are not universal.              In some\n\ncultures,    nudity     may   be   commonplace    while,   in    others,     the\n\nappearance of a woman's eyes may be lascivious.               See Ferber, 458\n\nU.S. at 775 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (noting the relevance of\n\ncultural norms to the harmfulness of a picture).           These norms will\n\nalso evolve over time. See Clay Calvert, The Perplexing Problem of\n\nChild Modeling Web Sites: Quasi-Child Pornography and Calls for New\n\nLegislation, 40 Cal. W. L. Rev. 231, 253-54 (2004). In prohibiting\n\nlascivious pictures of children, I believe Congress intended to\n\nprohibit pictures where, given our cultural norms, the content is\n\nharmful to the depicted child.\n\n            With these background principles in mind, I now address\n\nthe three images that are the subject of this appeal.                 First, the\n\nage and developmental state of the depicted child is relevant to\n\nthe harm caused and thus the lasciviousness of the images.                     A\n\npicture of a nude child is more likely to be harmful to the child\n\nwhen the depicted child is an adolescent or prepubescent rather\n\nthan an infant.         This is not because infants are beyond the\n\nperverse interests of pedophiles, but because nude pictures of\n\ninfants are so widely approved in our culture that such pictures\n\n\n                                      -28-\n\fare less likely to cause harm to the child.                The government has\n\nevidence that the depicted girls were ten to twelve years old at\n\nthe time the pictures were taken, and the pictures are consistent\n\nwith this evidence.        Because a picture of a nude ten-to-twelve-\n\nyear-old child is not socially acceptable, an exhibition of the\n\nchild's genitals or pubic area is more likely to be harmful to the\n\nchild.\n\n               Second, the portrayal of the child must be considered in\n\ndetermining whether an image is lascivious.           Analyzing the content\n\nof an image for sexually explicit content is a fractious issue.               We\n\nhave previously held that \"the statute requires more than mere\n\nnudity\" because otherwise \"the requirement of 'lasciviousness'\n\nwould be superfluous.\"          Amirault, 173 F.3d at 33.            Yet, other\n\ncircuits have found that nudity is not required for a lascivious\n\nexhibition.      United States v. Horn, 187 F.3d 781, 789-90 (8th Cir.\n\n1999); United States v. Knox, 32 F.3d 733, 745-46 (3d Cir. 1994).\n\nIn the three images, the girls are nude and their genitals are\n\nclearly visible.       The girls are posing for the camera, but the\n\nposes    are     neutral   in   the   sense   that   the    images    would   be\n\nunremarkable if the girls were clothed.         The images are in the form\n\nof a portrait as the girls' bodies are the focus of the image with\n\nnothing of significance in the background. The images are jarring,\n\nmore because of the cultural taboo regarding nude pictures of\n\nprepubescent girls than because of the specific portrayal of the\n\n\n                                      -29-\n\fgirls.    In light of our cultural norms, the primary purpose of the\n\nthree images appears to be the display of the girls' genitals.\n\nRegardless of whether or not the girls were exploited in the\n\nproduction of these images, the girls are being sexually exploited\n\nby the continued existence of these images.\n\n            I therefore believe that a reasonable jury could find\n\nthat the three images lasciviously display the girls' genitals or\n\npubic area in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2252(a)(4)(B).\n\n                   II.   Disagreements with the Majority\n\nA.    The meaning of lascivious in the statute\n\n            Section I of the majority opinion exhorts that we should\n\nnot    elaborate    on   the    meaning     of    \"lascivious\"      in   18   U.S.C.\n\n§    2256(2)(A)(v).      The    majority    states     the   statute     \"needs    no\n\nadornment\"    and     that     \"[f]urther       definitional   guides     are     not\n\nrequired.\"    I disagree with the majority's reasoning and believe\n\nthat we need to provide greater clarity as to Congress' intent in\n\nprohibiting child pornography.\n\n            Although     the    constitutionality      of    the    federal    child\n\npornography statute is not an issue on appeal, the majority notes\n\nthat the federal statute meets the constitutional requirements set\n\nout in Ferber, see 458 U.S. at 764-66, and that the statute is not\n\nunconstitutionally overbroad, see id. at 766-74.                    Although these\n\nlegal    conclusions     are    sound,    the    majority    then    applies    them\n\nunsoundly.    In sum, the majority argues that, since the statute is\n\n\n                                         -30-\n\fconstitutional, courts must not provide further guidance as to\n\nCongress' intent.18    I fail to see, however, how the satisfaction\n\nof   constitutional    requirements   precludes   federal   courts   in\n\nappropriate circumstances from saying precisely \"what the law is.\"\n\nMarbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137, 177 (1803).         Courts routinely\n\ninterpret the meaning of constitutional statutes, and this being an\n\n\"appropriate circumstance,\" I see no reason to refrain from doing\n\nso here.19\n\n             The meanings of lewd and lascivious in the obscenity and\n\nchild pornography statutes pose a difficult issue that requires\n\nclarification.     If the girls depicted in the three images were\n\neighteen years old and this case arose under an obscenity statute,\n\nit is beyond dispute that no reasonable jury could find that the\n\nimages lewdly display the genitals.20    We are now proceeding under\n\n\n     18\n      The majority also notes that other circuits have described\nlascivious as a \"commonsensical term.\"     While I agree that the\nmeaning of lascivious is, in large part, a matter of common sense,\nI do not see how this precludes us from providing further guidance\nas to Congress' intent.       Further, I reiterate that several\ncircuits, including ours, have applied the Dost factors to\nsupplement common sense. See Amirault, 173 F.3d at 31.\n     19\n      Other considerations could apply if the appeal raised First\nAmendment issues, but the only issue on appeal is whether the\ndistrict court erred in holding that no reasonable jury could find\nthat the three images are lascivious under the federal statute. In\ndiscussing the standard of review, below, I explain in more detail\nwhy there is no constitutional question present on appeal.\n     20\n      Because such images could not be obscene they could not be\nfound to lewdly display the genitals. Such images would clearly\nsatisfy the first prong of Miller in that they would appeal to the\n\"prurient interest\" and would satisfy the third prong in that they\n\n                                 -31-\n\fa child pornography statute and finding that a reasonable jury\n\ncould find that the images lasciviously depict the genitals of the\n\nten-to-twelve-year-old girls despite the fact that Supreme Court\n\nprecedent suggests that lewd and lascivious are synonymous.      See\n\nUnited States v. Excitement Video, Inc., 513 U.S. 64, 78-79 (1994).\n\nBecause these two outcomes do not blithely arise from the plain\n\ntext of the statutes, judicial elaboration of the meanings of\n\n\"lewd\" and \"lascivious\" is necessary.\n\n            The majority's exhortation to eschew further elaboration\n\nof the meaning of lascivious also runs counter to our binding\n\ncircuit precedent in Amirault.         In Amirault, we directly and\n\nclearly stated    that district courts may use the Dost factors in\n\ndetermining whether an image is lascivious.       Section IV of the\n\nAmirault opinion begins: \"Using the Dost factors as guideposts, we\n\nturn now to the photograph to analyze whether it contains a\n\nlascivious exhibition of the genitals.\"     Amirault, 173 F.3d at 33.\n\nThe Amirault court then considered each of the Dost factors in turn\n\nand concluded that the image in question was not lascivious.     Id.\n\nat 33-35.    Below, the district court applied the Dost factors in\n\n\nwould not have \"serious literary, artistic, political, or\nscientific value.\" Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 24 (1973).\nThe images must then fail Miller's second prong and must not\n\"depict[] or describe[], in a patently offensive way, sexual\nconduct specifically defined by the applicable state law.\" Id.\nThe Miller court included \"lewd exhibition of the genitals\" as an\nexample of a valid definition of patently offensive sexual conduct.\nId. at 25. It is thus clear that such images of eighteen-year-old\nwomen could not be found to lewdly display the genitals.\n\n                                -32-\n\fthe same way as we did in Amirault.        The majority, in holding that\n\nthe district court inappropriately applied the Dost factors,21 goes\n\nagainst   Amirault   and   leaves    First    Circuit   case   law   in    a\n\ncontradictory state.\n\n          The majority attempts -- unconvincingly, in my view -- to\n\nuse procedural posture to distinguish the issue before us from\n\nother First Circuit cases applying the Dost factors.           See United\n\nStates v. Hilton, 257 F.3d 50, 57-58 (1st Cir. 2001) (applying the\n\nDost factors at a sentencing hearing); United States v. Brunette,\n\n256 F.3d 14, 17-18 (1st Cir. 2001) (applying the Dost factors in\n\ndetermining the validity of a search warrant); Amirault, 173 F.3d\n\nat 30-31 (applying the Dost factors at a sentencing hearing).             The\n\nmajority is correct in noting that no circuit court has approved\n\nthe use of the Dost factors to exclude evidence on the grounds that\n\nno reasonable jury could find the images lascivious, but no circuit\n\ncourt has disapproved of such use either.          In my view, the Dost\n\nfactors are either relevant or they are not.        If the Dost factors\n\nare relevant in determining whether images are lascivious in the\n\ncontext of a sentencing hearing, then they are also relevant in\n\ndetermining whether a reasonable jury could find that images are\n\nlascivious in a hearing to exclude evidence before trial.                 The\n\n\n     21\n      The majority states that the district court \"gave the Dost\nfactors greater weight than warranted\" and \"accorded to them the\nsame status as the statutory definition itself.\" I do not see,\nhowever, how the district court's application of the Dost factors\ndiffered significantly from that of the Amirault court.\n\n                                    -33-\n\fmajority has not provided any persuasive rationale for such a\n\ndistinction.\n\nB.   The four corners rule in determining lasciviousness\n\n           In discussing the deficiencies of the Dost factors, the\n\nmajority criticized the district court for applying the \"four\n\ncorners rule\" whereby factors external to the actual image, such as\n\nthe circumstances surrounding the production of the image, are\n\nexcluded   from   the   determination   as   to   whether   an   image   is\n\nlascivious.    I agree with the majority that Amirault did not adopt\n\nsuch a rule, but I disagree with the majority's suggestion that the\n\njury could consider the circumstances of the production of the\n\nimage in determining lasciviousness.\n\n           First, the plain language of the statute is generally\n\nconsistent with the four corners rule.       The statute prohibits the\n\nknowing possession of five specifically defined types of visual\n\ndepictions.     In determining whether the possession of an image\n\nviolates the statue, the fact finder must examine the content of\n\nthe image.     The circumstances of the production of the image are\n\nrelevant to punishing the producer of the image but are of dubious\n\nrelevance in punishing the possessor of the image, who is likely\n\nignorant of the details of its production.\n\n           Second, the use of factors beyond the four corners of the\n\nimage in punishing the possessor of the image creates serious\n\nconstitutional concerns.      The Court in Ferber made clear that\n\n\n                                 -34-\n\f\"criminal responsibility may not be imposed [for possession of\n\nchild pornography] without some element of scienter on the part of\n\nthe defendant.\"    458 U.S. at 765.   Where the possessor of an image\n\nis ignorant of the circumstances of the production of the image,\n\nthe scienter requirement may be violated.\n\n           While I would not categorically prohibit any evidence\n\nbeyond the four corners of the image, only in rare situations will\n\nsuch   evidence    be   relevant    and   not    offend    constitutional\n\nrequirements.\n\nC.   Description of the images\n\n           The    majority's   description      of   the   three    images\n\ncontradicts the description given by the district court.           I would\n\nadopt the district court's description of the images because it is\n\nmore accurate.    According to the majority, a reasonable jury could\n\nfind that the images \"focus[] or particularly draw[] attention to\n\nthe girls' . . . vaginas\" and that \"each girl was deliberately\n\nposed to exhibit her pubic area.\" The majority further states that\n\nthe girls' postures are not \"particularly natural or spontaneous\"\n\nand were not \"comfortable.\"    In contrast, the district court found\n\nthat the \"genitals or pubic area [were not] the focal point\" of the\n\nimages, that the \"setting [was not] sexually suggestive at all,\"\n\nand that the poses were not \"unnatural.\"         My description of the\n\nimages, above, comports with the description given by the district\n\n\n\n\n                                   -35-\n\fcourt and more accurately represents the images than does the\n\nmajority's description.\n\nD.   Standard of review\n\n              I agree with the majority that we review de novo the\n\ndistrict court's holding that no reasonable jury could find the\n\nthree    images    lascivious   and   also     agree   with    the   majority's\n\nreasoning.        The majority's justification for de novo review,\n\nhowever, is not the justification proffered by the parties.                Both\n\nparties argued that the First Amendment demands heightened review\n\nof the district court's holding.             The majority did not consider\n\nthis rationale, and I write further to state explicitly that First\n\nAmendment heightened review does not apply to this case.                  It is\n\nillustrative to consider three scenarios: the district court holds\n\nthat    (1)   speech   is   unprotected;     (2)   speech     is   protected   on\n\nconstitutional grounds; and (3) speech is protected on statutory\n\ngrounds.\n\n(1) Speech is unprotected\n\n              It is well established that \"in cases raising First\n\nAmendment issues . . . an appellate court has an obligation to make\n\nan independent examination of the whole record in order to make\n\nsure that the judgment does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on\n\nthe field of free expression.\"         Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of\n\nUnited States, Inc., 466 U.S. 485, 499 (1984) (emphasis added and\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted).            The appellate court must \"be\n\n\n                                      -36-\n\fsure   that    the   speech   in   question   actually    falls   within   the\n\nunprotected category and . . . confine the perimeters of any\n\nunprotected category within acceptably narrow limits . . . to\n\nensure that protected expression will not be inhibited.\"               Id. at\n\n505.   There is no need to distinguish whether a district court held\n\nspeech unprotected on statutory or constitutional grounds, because\n\nthe former implies the latter.\n\n(2) Speech is protected on constitutional grounds\n\n              The role of the appellate court is less clear where the\n\ndistrict court holds that speech is protected on constitutional\n\ngrounds.      Some circuits have held that heightened First Amendment\n\nreview is only necessary to protect speech and does not apply where\n\nthe speech has already been protected.          See Multimedia Publishing\n\nCo. v. Greenville-Spartanburg Airport Dist., 991 F.2d 154, 160 (4th\n\nCir. 1993); Daily Herald Co. v. Munro, 838 F.2d 380, 383 (9th Cir.\n\n1988);   Planned     Parenthood     Association/Chicago    Area   v.   Chicago\n\nTransit Authority, 767 F.2d 1225, 1228-29 (7th Cir. 1985).              Other\n\ncircuits have applied heightened review to all constitutional\n\nholdings defining the perimeters of unprotected categories of\n\nspeech, regardless of whether the lower court held that speech was\n\nprotected or unprotected.          See Don's Porta Signs, Inc. v. City of\n\nClearwater, 829 F.2d 1051, 1053 n.9 (11th Cir. 1987); Lindsay v.\n\nSan Antonio, 821 F.2d 1103, 1107-08 (5th Cir. 1987).              We have yet\n\n\n\n\n                                      -37-\n\fto address the issue, and we need not address it now since the\n\ncourt's holding protecting speech was based on statutory grounds.\n\n(3) Speech is protected on statutory grounds\n\n          The   First    Amendment    determines     the    contours   of   the\n\nunprotected categories of speech and proscribes Congress from\n\nprohibiting protected speech. Congress, however, need not prohibit\n\nunprotected speech to the extent allowed by the constitution or\n\neven prohibit any unprotected speech at all.             The extent of speech\n\nprohibited by a constitutional statute must be contained within the\n\ncontours of an unprotected category.             Speech may thus fall into\n\nthree   categories:     (a)   protected     by     the    constitution,     (b)\n\nunprotected by the constitution and not prohibited by statute, and\n\n(c) unprotected by the constitution and prohibited by statute.\n\n          Where a district court makes a purely statutory holding\n\nthat specific speech is not prohibited by statute, the district\n\ncourt is holding only that Congress has chosen not to prohibit the\n\nspeech in question.     In such a situation, the district court is not\n\ndeciding whether or not Congress could prohibit the speech in\n\nquestion, only that it chose not to. This purely statutory holding\n\nclearly has no bearing on the contours of unprotected categories of\n\nspeech and thus no constitutional significance that would require\n\nheightened review.\n\n          Below, the district court's holding that no reasonable\n\njury could find the three images lascivious was a purely statutory\n\n\n                                     -38-\n\fholding.    The district court did not consider the contours of the\n\nunprotected category of child pornography and thus did not consider\n\nwhether the three images were unprotected speech.             Thus, the\n\ndistrict court held only that no reasonable jury could find that\n\nthe three images violated the child pornography statute passed by\n\nCongress.     Since   no   constitutional   issue   is   present,   First\n\nAmendment heightened review does not apply.22\n\n            Considering the above, I respectfully disagree with the\n\nmajority's reasoning in this case but join in the reversal of the\n\ndistrict court's order excluding the three images from evidence.\n\n\n\n\n     22\n       Moreover, it is not clear whether heightened First Amendment\nscrutiny applies at all to interlocutory appeals.       See Seattle\nTimes Co. v. Rhinehart, 467 U.S. 20, 36 & n.23 (1984). In Seattle\nTimes, the Supreme Court considered a First Amendment claim arising\nfrom a protective order issued during the discovery process and\nexpressly refused to apply a heightened standard of review. Id. at\n36. The Court was wary that heightened review \"would necessitate\nburdensome evidentiary findings and could lead to time-consuming\ninterlocutory appeals.\"     Id. at 36 n.23.      The perimeters of\nprotected categories of speech are defined by final judgments but\nnot by interlocutory decisions such as discovery orders and\nevidentiary rulings. See Lee v. DOJ, 413 F.3d 53, 58 (D.C. Cir.\n2005).\n\n                                  -39-\n\f",

FBI examiners then found a number of images on Frabizio's work computer that formed the basis for his indictment for possession of child pornography. In response to Frabizio's request for a bill of particulars, the government identified nineteen specific images it intended to introduce at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Frabizio moved to have the district court review the nineteen images before trial and to exclude from evidence those that the court determined would not meet the legal definition of \"sexually explicit conduct.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The government objected to the procedure, arguing that such a preliminary review of the images interfered with the jury's function. The government also argued that the standard to be applied if the court were to engage in such a review should be whether a reasonable jury could find that an image depicts \"sexually explicit conduct\" within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2256(2)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 21, 2005, the district court granted Frabizio's request that it perform a preliminary review of the images in order to determine their admissibility. The court, as the government had urged, adopted the standard of whether a reasonable jury could find that the images depicted \"sexually explicit conduct\" in the form of \"lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the hearing before the district court, the government explained that it was prepared to present evidence that three of the images, Exhibits 1, 2, and 3, were of \"known child victims.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> This evidence was significant because \"the government must prove that an image depicts actual children to sustain a . . . conviction\" under the statute. <i>United States v. Hilton,</i> 386 F.3d 13, 18 (1st Cir.2004) (per curiam) (citing <i>Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coal.,</i> 535 U.S. 234, 251-56, 122 S.Ct. 1389, 152 L.Ed.2d 403 (2002)). Frabizio focused his challenge on those three images and one other. After examining the images, and eschewing consideration of the circumstances in which the photographs were produced or of any other evidence, the district court issued an order on May 9, 2005, in which it excluded from evidence the three images of the putative \"known child victims,\" Exhibits 1, 2, and 3, but agreed with the government that the fourth challenged exhibit was admissible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Utilizing the so-called \"<i>Dost</i> factors,\" <i>see United States v.

Wiegand,</i> 812 F.2d 1239 (9th Cir. 1987), the district court concluded that no reasonable jury could conclude that Exhibits 1, 2, or 3 met the statutory requirement of \"lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area.\" The court then said it was excluding the images pursuant to Rule 104(a) of the Federal Rules of Evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> In a footnote, the court also said it would use Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence as an alternate basis for exclusion, because the government could rely on the sixteen other images identified in its bill of particulars, and thus Exhibits 1, 2, and 3 would only be cumulative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this interlocutory appeal, over which we have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3731, the government challenges the exclusion of the three images.

Indeed, this question, like one arising in the context of a challenge to the sufficiency of evidence supporting a jury's verdict, is one of which we engage in de novo review. <i>Cf. United States v. Rayl,</i> 270 F.3d 709, 712 (8th Cir.2001) (reviewing a sufficiency challenge to a jury verdict of guilty in a child pornography case); <i>cf. also United States v.

Also, our review of the meaning of the statute is de novo. <i>See In re Pharmatrak, Inc.,</i> 329 F.3d 9, 19 (1st Cir.2003); <i>United States v.

Ferber,</i> 458 U.S. 747, 102 S.Ct. 3348, 73 L.Ed.2d 1113 (1982), which upheld against a First Amendment challenge a New York statute criminalizing the distribution of child pornography. In <i>Ferber,</i> the Court held that the New York statute served the purpose of \"prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse of children,\" which was \"a government objective of surpassing importance.\" <i>Id.</i> at 757, 102 S.Ct. 3348. The Court recognized that \"the use of children as subjects of pornographic materials is harmful to the physiological, emotional, and mental health of the child[ren].\" <i>Id.</i> at 758, 102 S.Ct. 3348. The distribution of child pornography, the Court reasoned, \"is intrinsically related to the sexual abuse of children in at least two ways\": \"First, the materials produced are a permanent record of the children's participation and the harm to the child[ren] is exacerbated by their circulation. Second, the distribution network for child pornography must be closed if the production of material which requires the sexual exploitation of children is to be effectively controlled.\" <i>Id.</i> at 759, 102 S.Ct. 3348 (footnote omitted); <i>see also Osborne v. Ohio,</i> 495 U.S. 103, 110-11, 110 S.Ct. 1691, 109 L.Ed.2d 98 (1990) (upholding the prohibition on private possession of child pornography for these same reasons, among others).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of the \"particular and more compelling interest in prosecuting those who promote the sexual exploitation of children,\" the Court held that all child pornography &#8212; even that which is not obscene under the standard set forth in <i>Miller v. California,</i> 413 U.S. 15, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973) &#8212; is outside the scope of the First Amendment and can be banned. <i>Ferber,</i> 458 U.S. at 761, 102 S.Ct. 3348; <i>see also Free Speech Coal.,</i> 535 U.S. at 240, 122 S.Ct. 1389 (\"As a general rule, pornography can be banned only if obscene, but under <i>Ferber,</i> pornography showing minors can be proscribed whether or not the images are obscene . . . .\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Importantly for our case, the Supreme Court also held in <i>Ferber</i> that laws banning child pornography withstand First Amendment scrutiny so long as \"the conduct to be prohibited [is] adequately defined by the applicable . . . law, as written or authoritatively construed\"; the material prohibited \"involve[s] live performance or photographic or other visual reproduction of live performances\"; and \"criminal responsibility [is not] imposed without some element of scienter on the part of the defendant.\" <i>Ferber,</i> 458 U.S. at 764-65, 102 S.Ct. 3348. The Court then looked to the New York statute, which prohibited the distribution of material depicting \"sexual conduct,\" which was statutorily defined as, inter alia, \"lewd exhibition of the genitals.\" The Court concluded this was a definition which did not offend the First Amendment. <i>See id.</i> at 765, 773-74, 102 S.Ct. 3348.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court went beyond that. It also observed that the term \"lewd exhibition of the genitals\" was a known quantity in this area of law, and that it \"was given in <i>Miller</i> as an example of a permissible regulation.\" <i>Id.</i> at 765, 102 S.Ct. 3348 (citing <i>Miller,</i> 413 U.S. at 25, 93 S.Ct. 2607); <i>see also Osborne,</i> 495 U.S. at 114, 110 S.Ct. 1691.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The language of the federal statute under consideration in this case is virtually the same as that upheld in <i>Ferber</i> as an adequate definition in light of First Amendment concerns.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> In 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2256(2)(A), the word \"lascivious\" replaces the word \"lewd,\" as was used by the New York statute upheld in <i>Ferber.</i> Moreover, the federal prohibition extends beyond \"the genitals\" to the \"pubic area.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> The Courts of Appeals have uniformly treated the terms \"lewd\" and \"lascivious\" as materially equivalent. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Adams,</i> 343 F.3d 1024, 1035 (9th Cir.2003) (\"We hold that the statute at issue in <i>Ferber</i> is legally indistinguishable from 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2256(2)(A). . . . [T]his court has equated `lascivious' with `lewd.'\" (citing <i>Wiegand,</i> 812 F.2d at 1243)); <i>United States v. Reedy,</i> 845 F.2d 239, 241 (10th Cir.1988). The Supreme Court has itself endorsed this position. <i>See United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc.</i> (<i>X-Citement Video II</i>), 513 U.S. 64, 78-79, 115 S.Ct. 464, 130 L.Ed.2d 372 (1994) (approving of <i>United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc.,</i> 982 F.2d 1285, 1288 (9th Cir.1992), <i>rev'd on other grounds, X-Citement Video II,</i> 513 U.S. 64, 115 S.Ct. 464, 130 L.Ed.2d 372). The addition of the term \"pubic area\" has independent significance in that it broadens the class of exhibitions that may be prohibited.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Lascivious\" is a \"commonsensical term,\" and whether a given depiction is lascivious is a question of fact for the jury. <i>Wiegand,</i> 812 F.2d at 1243; <i>see also Rayl,</i> 270 F.3d at 714 (\"[T]he question whether materials depict `lascivious exhibition of the genitals,' an element of the crime, is for the finder of fact.\"); <i>Reedy,</i> 845 F.2d at 241 (\"This [c]ourt agrees . . . that `lascivious' is . . . a commonsensical term . . . .\" (internal quotation mark omitted) (quoting <i>Wiegand,</i> 812 F.2d at 1243)).

Arvin,</i> 900 F.2d 1385, 1390 (9th Cir.1990); <i>see also id.</i> (citing cases). The courts are also in agreement that the term \"lascivious\" is sufficiently well defined to provide persons \"of reasonable intelligence, guided by common understanding and practices,\" notice of what is permissible and what is impermissible. <i>United States v. Freeman,</i> 808 F.2d 1290, 1292 (8th Cir.1987) (rejecting vagueness challenge); <i>accord, e.g., X-Citement Video II,</i> 513 U.S. at 78-79, 115 S.Ct. 464 (endorsing circuit court's conclusion that \"lascivious\" was a constitutionally permissible standard and was neither overbroad nor vague); <i>Adams,</i> 343 F.3d at 1035-36 (rejecting argument that \"lascivious\" is \"too subjective\" and \"not susceptible to a common understanding\"); <i>cf. Ferber,</i> 458 U.S. at 765, 102 S.Ct. 3348 (holding that the New York statute was not unconstitutionally underinclusive, because it \"sufficiently describes a category of material the production and distribution of which is not entitled to First Amendment protection\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subject to motions under Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, it is up to the <i>jury</i> to determine whether the images identified in the bill of particulars as a basis for an indictment under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2252(a)(4)(B) constitute visual depictions of \"sexually explicit conduct,\" defined as \"lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area\" under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2256(2)(A)(v). In making this determination, the standard to be applied by the jury is the statutory standard. The statutory standard needs no adornment. The Supreme Court has made clear that the Constitution does not require additional glossing or narrowing of the standard, <i>see Ferber,</i> 458 U.S. at 765, 102 S.Ct. 3348; <i>cf. id.</i> at 764, 102 S.Ct. 3348 (\"A trier of fact need not find that the material appeals to the prurient interest of the average person; it is not required that sexual conduct portrayed be done so in a patently offensive manner; and the material at issue need not be considered as a whole.\"), and Congress has chosen not to employ any additional glossing. Further definitional guides are not required and, indeed, would be prohibited if they functioned to narrow the statutory definition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Using the statutory standard and asking whether a reasonable jury could conclude that Exhibits 1, 2, and 3 met the standard, this panel has reviewed the disputed images and has concluded that a reasonable jury could decide that the three photographs constitute lascivious exhibitions of the genitals or pubic area within meaning of the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We describe how a reasonable jury could view the three exhibits under consideration, with full recognition that a thousand words are not necessarily worth a picture. Each of the three photographs depicts a nude girl, who is posed alone and who is looking directly at the camera. Each girl appears on the cusp of puberty, either prepubescent or adolescent. The subjects of the photographs, who are of an age when girls normally are clothed even when in nature or in a stream, are completely unclothed (except for some jewelry), and the settings of the photographs provide no ready explanation that makes the nudity indisputably innocent. Moreover, in each photograph, a jury could reasonably conclude that there was an \"exhibition\" of the \"pubic area\": each of the girls' legs are parted and the pubic area is plainly visible. Indeed, the photos could reasonably be seen as focusing on or particularly drawing attention to the girls' pubic areas and, specifically, to their vaginas. A jury could reasonably conclude that none of the girls' postures were natural or spontaneous, that each girl was deliberately posed to exhibit her pubic area, and that the posture in which each was posed was not a comfortable one. As a jury will consider the images, we think the wisest course is to avoid more detailed description of them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the criteria under the statute and the constitutional limits set by <i>Ferber,</i> and our own review of the exhibits, we conclude that a reasonable jury could find that the three photographs constitute \"lascivious exhibitions of the genitals or pubic area\" within the meaning of the statute, and that the district court erred in taking the evidence away from the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Difficulties with the Analytical Methodology and the Use of the Dost Factors</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having held that the district court erred in its determination, under Rule 104(a), that no reasonable jury could find these images to be a lascivious display of the genitals or pubic area, we also express concern about the approach that the district court took in reaching its decision &#8212; an approach that, we recognize, was urged upon the court by the parties. In excluding the three exhibits, the court analyzed the question of whether to exclude the evidence almost exclusively in terms of the <i>Dost</i> factors, and, in our view, overemphasized those factors in a way which raised the risk of inappropriately limiting the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has described the <i>Dost</i> factors as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) whether the genitals or pubic area are the focal point of the image; (2) whether the setting of the image is sexually suggestive (i.e., a location generally associated with sexual activity); (3) whether the child is depicted in an unnatural pose or inappropriate attire considering her age; (4) whether the child is fully or partially clothed, or nude; (5) whether the image suggests sexual coyness or willingness to engage in sexual activity; and (6) whether the image is intended or designed to elicit a sexual response in the viewer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v. Amirault,</i> 173 F.3d 28, 31 (1st Cir.1999) (citing <i>Dost,</i> 636 F.Supp. at 832).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Amirault,</i> this court gave a qualified endorsement of the <i>Dost</i> factors, stating that they are \"generally relevant and provide some guidance.\" <i>Id.</i> at 32. We did not, however, suggest that the <i>Dost</i> factors were the equivalent of &#8212; or established the limits of &#8212; the statutory term \"lascivious.\" Indeed, we reached the opposite conclusion: \"[w]e emphasize[d] . . . that these factors are neither comprehensive nor necessarily applicable in every situation\" and that \"[t]he inquiry will always be case-specific.\" <i>Id.; see also United States v. Hilton,</i> 257 F.3d 50, 57 (1st Cir.2001) (warning that the <i>Dost</i> factors, \"although `generally relevant,' are not comprehensive[,] and each determination of whether an image contains a lascivious display is necessarily case specific\" (quoting <i>Amirault,</i> 173 F.3d at 32)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the district court's analysis, although reciting the above language, in fact gave the <i>Dost</i> factors greater weight than warranted. The court appeared to treat the <i>Dost</i> factors as exhaustive and to use them to set the boundaries of the statutory term \"lascivious.\" The court thus applied the six <i>Dost</i> factors in a way that accorded to them the same status as the statutory definition itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The consequence of the district court's unqualified application of the <i>Dost</i> factors was to take the issue of the lasciviousness of the three images away from a jury. None of the cases in which this court has referred to the <i>Dost</i> factors raised such a prospect.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> In <i>Amirault,</i> for example, the issue on appeal was whether the district court had properly increased the sentence, under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, of a defendant who had pleaded guilty to one count of possession of child pornography, by applying a cross-reference that resulted in a higher base-offense level if the crime involved trafficking in visual depictions of lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of a minor. 173 F.3d at 30-31. In <i>Amirault,</i> the task of interpreting and applying the Sentencing Guidelines was for the court, and any close \"judgment calls\" &#8212; and we noted that there were some &#8212; were the court's to make. <i>Id.</i> at 35. Indeed, the particular image on which the trafficking cross-reference was predicated was not one that had formed the basis of the conviction. <i>Id.</i> at 30.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No other circuit court, as best we can tell, has ever approved the use of the <i>Dost</i> factors in a pretrial proceeding to remove the consideration of the lasciviousness of an image from a jury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are many reasons for the need for caution about the use of the <i>Dost</i> factors, particularly in this way. First is the fact that the <i>Dost</i> factors have fostered myriad disputes that have led courts far afield from the statutory language. One dispute is, for example, how many of the factors must be present in an image for it to qualify as \"lascivious.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> <i>Compare, e.g., United States v. Wolf,</i> 890 F.2d 241, 245 &amp; n. 6 (10th Cir.1989) (\"We do not hold that more than one <i>Dost</i> factor must be present . . . .\"), <i>with United States v. Villard,</i> 885 F.2d 117, 122 (3d Cir.1989) (\"Although more than one factor must be present in order to establish `lasciviousness,' all six factors need not be present.\"). Another dispute is about what the specific factors mean. <i>See, e.g., Amirault,</i> 173 F.3d at 34 (cataloging disagreement about what the sixth <i>Dost</i> factor means). As one commentator observed, \"the <i>Dost</i> test has produced a profoundly incoherent body of case law.\" A. Adler, <i>Inverting the First Amendment,</i> 149 U. Pa. L.Rev. 921, 953 (2001). There is every reason to avoid importing unnecessary interpretive conundrums into a statute, especially where the statute employs terms that lay people are perfectly capable of understanding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even more significantly, there is a risk that the <i>Dost</i> factors will be used to inappropriately <i>limit</i> the scope of the statutory definition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> That is impermissible. We offer two examples in which such a risk has been raised.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first example is one that was noted by the Ninth Circuit when affirming one of the convictions in the <i>Dost</i> case. In <i>United States v. Wiegand,</i> 812 F.2d 1239, the Ninth Circuit noted that the <i>Dost</i> factors were \"over-generous to the defendant.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1244. Specifically, the court took issue with the fifth factor articulated by the district court: \"whether the visual depiction suggests sexual coyness or a willingness to engage in sexual activity.\" <i>Dost,</i> 636 F.Supp. at 832. The appellate court expressed disapproval at \"[t]he standard employed by the district court[, which] . . . impl[ied] . . . that the pictures would not be lascivious unless they showed sexual activity or willingness to engage in it.\" <i>Wiegand,</i> 812 F.2d at 1244. Emphasizing that \"[t]he offense defined by the statute is depiction of a `lascivious exhibition of the genitals,'\" the appellate court held that it was enough that \"the pictures were an exhibition,\" \"[t]he exhibition was of the genitals,\" and \"[e]ach of the pictures featured the child photographed as a sexual object.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is obvious that if an image does depict a sexually alluring look from the minor, it will be easier to show that the image is lascivious. The absence of a sexual come-on, though, does not mean that an image is not lascivious, as <i>Wiegand</i> and other cases have noted. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Knox,</i> 32 F.3d 733, 747 (3d Cir.1994) (\"Children posing for pornographic pictures may suffer dramatic harm regardless of whether they have an `adult' look of sexual invitation or coyness on their face.\"); <i>Wolf,</i> 890 F.2d at 247 (noting that \"a sexually exploitative photograph of a child need not portray the victim in a pose that `depicts lust, wantonness, sexual coyness or other inappropriate precocity'\"). Children do not characteristically have countenances inviting sexual activity, and the statute does not presume that they do. By suggesting that the child subject must exhibit sexual coyness in order for an image to be lascivious, the district court in <i>Dost</i> ran the risk of limiting the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second example of how the <i>Dost</i> factors may risk limiting the statute manifested itself in this case. In its order, the district court overread <i>Amirault</i> as holding that a jury, in determining whether a given image constitutes a \"lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area,\" is limited to considering \"the objective criteria of the photograph's design,\" <i>Amirault,</i> 173 F.3d at 35 &#8212; what the district court called \"the four corners of the image\" &#8212; and nothing else.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> The district court erred in stating that this court has adopted a general \"four corners rule.\" <i>Amirault</i> did not adopt such a rule,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> and the text of the statute itself does not require it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue of the four corners rule, and even of what it means, has not been decided by this circuit, and we do not decide it here. The issue is complicated, and there are arguments going different ways. For example, it is clear that the jury may hear evidence about the circumstances of the production of an image in determining whether the child depicted therein is real. It is arguable that a jury should not be precluded from considering such evidence on the question of lasciviousness as well. The laws prohibiting possession of child pornography are constitutional because the government has a compelling interest in preventing sexual exploitation of children; it is not obvious that a jury cannot consider evidence of exactly that exploitation in evaluating the lasciviousness of the materials. <i>Cf. Free Speech Coal.,</i> 535 U.S. at 254, 122 S.Ct. 1389 (\"In the case of the material covered by <i>Ferber,</i> the creation of the speech is itself the crime of child abuse . . . .\"); <i>see also id.</i> at 250, 122 S.Ct. 1389 (noting that \"speech [that] had what the Court in effect held was a proximate link to the crime from which it came\" was not constitutionally protected). But there are also arguments, usually made in the context of the very different question of whether the subjective reaction or intent of the viewer should be taken into account when determining whether an image is lascivious, that lasciviousness should be determined from the image alone. <i>Cf. Villard,</i> 885 F.2d at 125 (holding, in the context of a sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenge to a jury verdict, that in evaluating the question of an image's lasciviousness, \"[w]e must . . . look at the photograph, rather than the viewer,\" because if \"we were to conclude that the photographs were lascivious merely because Villard found them sexually arousing, we would be engaging in conclusory bootstrapping\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue, however, has not been squarely presented to us in this case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> We flag it only to express concern that in deriving such a prohibition from <i>Dost</i> or from a misunderstanding of our case law, the district court ran the risk of impermissibly narrowing the scope of the statute by imposing upon the statute a limitation that was in no way compelled by the statutory text itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We stress that our holding today is limited: We do not hold that the <i>Dost</i> factors may never be used. We hold only that they are not the equivalent of the statutory standard of \"lascivious exhibition\" and are not to be used to limit the statutory standard.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Exclusion of Exhibits Under Fed.R.Evid. 403</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a footnote, the district court alternatively excluded the three exhibits pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 403, holding that the three images were cumulative in that the government could rely on the sixteen other images identified in its bill of particulars.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Rule 403 \"enables a trial judge to exclude needlessly cumulative evidence,\" it also \"requires a balance of probative value against the negative consequences of using a particular piece of evidence.\" <i>Sec'y of Labor v.

We review the district court's application of Rule 403 deferentially, but will overturn the district court's ruling if there is an abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Gilbert,</i> 229 F.3d 15, 20-21 (1st Cir.2000). \"[A]n abuse of discretion occurs `when a relevant factor deserving of significant weight is overlooked, or when an improper factor is accorded significant weight, or when the court considers the appropriate mix of factors, but commits a palpable error of judgment in calibrating the decisional scales.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 21 (quoting <i>United States v.

The term \"sexually explicit conduct\" includes the \"lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2256(2)(A).

Dost</i> enumerated a list of factors to consider in determining whether a picture lasciviously exhibits the genitals or pubic area. 636 F.Supp. 828, 832 (S.D.Cal.1986), <i>aff'd sub nom. United States v. Wiegand,</i> 812 F.2d 1239, 1244 (9th Cir.1987). Several circuits, including ours, have referred to the <i>Dost</i> factors in considering whether images lasciviously exhibit the genitals or pubic area. <i>See United States v. Amirault,</i> 173 F.3d 28, 31 (1st Cir.1999) (citing cases). While we found that the <i>Dost</i> factors were generally relevant and provided guidance, our embrace of them was only equivocal. <i>Id.</i> at 32. We found that the factors \"are neither comprehensive nor necessarily applicable in every situation\" and that \"there may be other factors that are equally if not more important in determining whether a photograph contains a lascivious exhibition.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before considering whether a reasonable jury could find the three images lascivious, I wish to note several background principles relevant to our analysis. First, I believe that an important consideration, which was not directly addressed by <i>Dost</i> nor by the district court, is whether the production or existence of the picture is harmful to the depicted child. Clearly, the protection of children from sexual exploitation is \"a government objective of surpassing importance.\" <i>New York v. Ferber,</i> 458 U.S. 747, 757, 102 S.Ct. 3348, 73 L.Ed.2d 1113 (1982). The victims of child pornography can be harmed not only by the production of the pornography but also by the continued existence of the pornography on the Internet. <i>See id.</i> at 759-60, 102 S.Ct. 3348 &amp; n. 10. Furthermore, the existence of the pornography can be harmful to the child even if its production was not (e.g., if photographs were surreptitiously taken).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In passing and amending laws prohibiting child pornography, Congress has clearly been concerned with protecting children from harm. <i>See</i> Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-208, &#167; 121, 110 Stat. 3009, 3009-26 (1996) (finding that child pornography \"is a form of sexual abuse which can result in physical or psychological harm, or both, to the children involved.\"); Child Abuse Victims' Rights Act of 1986, Pub.L. No. 99-591, 100 Stat. 3341-74 (1986) (recognizing \"the physiological, psychological, and emotional harm caused by the production, distribution, and display of child pornography by strengthening laws prescribing such activity\"); Child Protection Act of 1984, Pub.L. No. 98-292, 98 Stat. 204 (1984) (finding that \"the use of children as subjects of pornographic materials is harmful to the physiological, emotional, and mental health of the individual child and to society\"). The government is prosecuting Defendant for violating 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2252. This statute is titled \"Certain activities relating to material involving the sexual exploitation of minors\" and is under the chapter titled \"SEXUAL EXPLOITATION AND OTHER ABUSE OF CHILDREN.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is my belief that Congress intended that the perceived harm to the depicted child by the production or existence of the picture be an essential factor in determining whether a picture lasciviously depicts the genitals or pubic area. While the <i>Dost</i> factors address the harm to the child in an oblique manner, I instead put the harm at the forefront of the analysis. <i>See Amirault,</i> 173 F.3d at 32 (stating that the <i>Dost</i> factors \"are neither comprehensive nor necessarily applicable in every situation\"). To the extent that the <i>Dost</i> factors address the harm to the child, they will be relevant to my analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The notion of what depictions are harmful to the child cannot help but be informed by cultural norms. While the act of exploiting a child is harmful by definition, certain displays of nudity may be harmful solely because they are socially unacceptable. These social norms are not universal. In some cultures, nudity may be commonplace while, in others, the appearance of a woman's eyes may be lascivious. <i>See Ferber,</i> 458 U.S. at 775, 102 S.Ct. 3348 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (noting the relevance of cultural norms to the harmfulness of a picture). These norms will also evolve over time. <i>See</i> Clay Calvert, <i>The Perplexing Problem of Child Modeling Web Sites: Quasi-Child Pornography and Calls for New Legislation,</i> 40 Cal. W.L.Rev. 231, 253-54 (2004). In prohibiting lascivious pictures of children, I believe Congress intended to prohibit pictures where, given our cultural norms, the content is harmful to the depicted child.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With these background principles in mind, I now address the three images that are the subject of this appeal. First, the age and developmental state of the depicted child is relevant to the harm caused and thus the lasciviousness of the images. A picture of a nude child is more likely to be harmful to the child when the depicted child is an adolescent or prepubescent rather than an infant. This is not because infants are beyond the perverse interests of pedophiles, but because nude pictures of infants are so widely approved in our culture that such pictures are less likely to cause harm to the child. The government has evidence that the depicted girls were ten to twelve years old at the time the pictures were taken, and the pictures are consistent with this evidence. Because a picture of a nude ten-to-twelve-year-old child is not socially acceptable, an exhibition of the child's genitals or pubic area is more likely to be harmful to the child.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the portrayal of the child must be considered in determining whether an image is lascivious. Analyzing the content of an image for sexually explicit content is a fractious issue. We have previously held that \"the statute requires more than mere nudity\" because otherwise \"the requirement of `lasciviousness' would be superfluous.\" <i>Amirault,</i> 173 F.3d at 33. Yet, other circuits have found that nudity is not required for a lascivious exhibition. <i>United States v. Horn,</i> 187 F.3d 781, 789-90 (8th Cir.1999); <i>United States v. Knox,</i> 32 F.3d 733, 745-46 (3d Cir.1994). In the three images, the girls are nude and their genitals are clearly visible. The girls are posing for the camera, but the poses are neutral in the sense that the images would be unremarkable if the girls were clothed. The images are in the form of a portrait as the girls' bodies are the focus of the image with nothing of significance in the background. The images are jarring, more because of the cultural taboo regarding nude pictures of prepubescent girls than because of the specific portrayal of the girls. In light of our cultural norms, the primary purpose of the three images appears to be the display of the girls' genitals. Regardless of whether or not the girls were exploited in the production of these images, the girls are being sexually exploited by the continued existence of these images.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I therefore believe that a reasonable jury could find that the three images lasciviously display the girls' genitals or pubic area in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2252(a)(4)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Disagreements with the Majority</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The meaning of lascivious in the statute</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section I of the majority opinion exhorts that we should not elaborate on the meaning of \"lascivious\" in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2256(2)(A)(v). The majority states the statute \"needs no adornment\" and that \"[f]urther definitional guides are not required.\" I disagree with the majority's reasoning and believe that we need to provide greater clarity as to Congress' intent in prohibiting child pornography.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the constitutionality of the federal child pornography statute is not an issue on appeal, the majority notes that the federal statute meets the constitutional requirements set out in <i>Ferber, see</i> 458 U.S. at 764-66, 102 S.Ct. 3348, and that the statute is not unconstitutionally overbroad, <i>see id.</i> at 766-74, 102 S.Ct. 3348. Although these legal conclusions are sound, the majority then applies them unsoundly. In sum, the majority argues that, since the statute is constitutional, courts must not provide further guidance as to Congress' intent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> I fail to see, however, how the satisfaction of constitutional requirements precludes federal courts in appropriate circumstances from saying precisely \"what the law is.\" <i>Marbury v. Madison,</i> 1 Cranch 137, 5 U.S. 137, 177, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803). Courts routinely interpret the meaning of constitutional statutes, and this being an \"appropriate circumstance,\" I see no reason to refrain from doing so here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The meanings of lewd and lascivious in the obscenity and child pornography statutes pose a difficult issue that requires clarification. If the girls depicted in the three images were eighteen years old and this case arose under an <i>obscenity statute,</i> it is beyond dispute that no reasonable jury could find that the images <i>lewdly</i> display the genitals.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> We are now proceeding under a <i>child pornography statute</i> and finding that a reasonable jury could find that the images <i>lasciviously</i> depict the genitals of the ten-to-twelve-year-old girls despite the fact that Supreme Court precedent suggests that <i>lewd and lascivious are synonymous. See United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc.,</i> 513 U.S. 64, 78-79, 115 S.Ct. 464, 130 L.Ed.2d 372 (1994). Because these two outcomes do not blithely arise from the plain text of the statutes, judicial elaboration of the meanings of \"lewd\" and \"lascivious\" is necessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority's exhortation to eschew further elaboration of the meaning of lascivious also runs counter to our binding circuit precedent in <i>Amirault.</i> In <i>Amirault,</i> we directly and clearly stated that district courts may use the <i>Dost</i> factors in determining whether an image is lascivious. Section IV of the <i>Amirault</i> opinion begins: \"Using the <i>Dost</i> factors as guideposts, we turn now to the photograph to analyze whether it contains a lascivious exhibition of the genitals.\" <i>Amirault,</i> 173 F.3d at 33. The <i>Amirault</i> court then considered each of the <i>Dost</i> factors in turn and concluded that the image in question was not lascivious. <i>Id.</i> at 33-35. Below, the district court applied the <i>Dost</i> factors in the same way as we did in <i>Amirault.</i> The majority, in holding that the district court inappropriately applied the <i>Dost</i> factors,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> goes against <i>Amirault</i> and leaves First Circuit case law in a contradictory state.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority attempts &#8212; unconvincingly, in my view &#8212; to use procedural posture to distinguish the issue before us from other First Circuit cases applying the <i>Dost</i> factors. <i>See United States v. Hilton,</i> 257 F.3d 50, 57-58 (1st Cir.2001) (applying the <i>Dost</i> factors at a sentencing hearing); <i>United States v. Brunette,</i> 256 F.3d 14, 17-18 (1st Cir.2001) (applying the <i>Dost</i> factors in determining the validity of a search warrant); <i>Amirault,</i> 173 F.3d at 30-31 (applying the <i>Dost</i> factors at a sentencing hearing). The majority is correct in noting that no circuit court has approved the use of the <i>Dost</i> factors to exclude evidence on the grounds that no reasonable jury could find the images lascivious, but no circuit court has disapproved of such use either. In my view, the <i>Dost</i> factors are either relevant or they are not. If the <i>Dost</i> factors are relevant in determining whether images are lascivious in the context of a sentencing hearing, then they are also relevant in determining whether a reasonable jury could find that images are lascivious in a hearing to exclude evidence before trial. The majority has not provided any persuasive rationale for such a distinction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The four corners rule in determining lasciviousness</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In discussing the deficiencies of the <i>Dost</i> factors, the majority criticized the district court for applying the \"four corners rule\" whereby factors external to the actual image, such as the circumstances surrounding the production of the image, are excluded from the determination as to whether an image is lascivious. I agree with the majority that <i>Amirault</i> did not adopt such a rule, but I disagree with the majority's suggestion that the jury could consider the circumstances of the production of the image in determining lasciviousness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the plain language of the statute is generally consistent with the four corners rule. The statute prohibits the knowing possession of five specifically defined types of visual depictions. In determining whether the possession of an image violates the statute, the fact finder must examine the content of the image. The circumstances of the production of the image are relevant to punishing the producer of the image but are of dubious relevance in punishing the possessor of the image, who is likely ignorant of the details of its production.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the use of factors beyond the four corners of the image in punishing the possessor of the image creates serious constitutional concerns. The Court in <i>Ferber</i> made clear that \"criminal responsibility may not be imposed [for possession of child pornography] without some element of scienter on the part of the defendant.\" 458 U.S. at 765, 102 S.Ct. 3348. Where the possessor of an image is ignorant of the circumstances of the production of the image, the scienter requirement may be violated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While I would not categorically prohibit any evidence beyond the four corners of the image, only in rare situations will such evidence be relevant and not offend constitutional requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Description of the images</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority's description of the three images contradicts the description given by the district court. I would adopt the district court's description of the images because it is more accurate. According to the majority, a reasonable jury could find that the images \"focus[] or particularly draw[] attention to the girls' . . . vaginas\" and that \"each girl was deliberately posed to exhibit her pubic area.\" The majority further states that the girls' postures are not \"particularly natural or spontaneous\" and were not \"comfortable.\" In contrast, the district court found that the \"genitals or pubic area [were not] the focal point\" of the images, that the \"setting [was not] sexually suggestive at all,\" and that the poses were not \"unnatural.\" My description of the images, above, comports with the description given by the district court and more accurately represents the images than does the majority's description.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Standard of review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I agree with the majority that we review <i>de novo</i> the district court's holding that no reasonable jury could find the three images lascivious and also agree with the majority's reasoning. The majority's justification for <i>de novo</i> review, however, is not the justification proffered by the parties. Both parties argued that the First Amendment demands heightened review of the district court's holding. The majority did not consider this rationale, and I write further to state explicitly that First Amendment heightened review does not apply to this case. It is illustrative to consider three scenarios: the district court holds that (1) speech is unprotected; (2) speech is protected on constitutional grounds; and (3) speech is protected on statutory grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) Speech is unprotected</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well established that \"in cases raising First Amendment issues . . . an appellate court has an obligation to make an independent examination of the whole record in order to make sure that the judgment does not constitute a <i>forbidden intrusion on the field of free expression.</i>\" <i>Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc.,</i> 466 U.S. 485, 499, 104 S.Ct. 1949, 80 L.Ed.2d 502 (1984) (emphasis added and internal quotation marks omitted). The appellate court must \"be sure that the speech in question actually falls within the unprotected category and . . . confine the perimeters of any unprotected category within acceptably narrow limits . . . to ensure that protected expression will not be inhibited.\" <i>Id.</i> at 505, 104 S.Ct. 1949. There is no need to distinguish whether a district court held speech unprotected on statutory or constitutional grounds, because the former implies the latter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) Speech is protected on constitutional grounds</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The role of the appellate court is less clear where the district court holds that speech is protected on constitutional grounds. Some circuits have held that heightened First Amendment review is only necessary to protect speech and does not apply where the speech has already been protected. <i>See Multimedia Publishing Co. v. Greenville-Spartanburg Airport Dist.,</i> 991 F.2d 154, 160 (4th Cir.1993); <i>Daily Herald Co. v. Munro,</i> 838 F.2d 380, 383 (9th Cir.1988); <i>Planned Parenthood Association/Chicago Area v. Chicago Transit Authority,</i> 767 F.2d 1225, 1228-29 (7th Cir.1985). Other circuits have applied heightened review to all constitutional holdings defining the perimeters of unprotected categories of speech, regardless of whether the lower court held that speech was protected or unprotected. <i>See Don's Porta Signs, Inc. v. City of Clearwater,</i> 829 F.2d 1051, 1053 n. 9 (11th Cir.1987); <i>Lindsay v. San Antonio,</i> 821 F.2d 1103, 1107-08 (5th Cir.1987). We have yet to address the issue, and we need not address it now since the court's holding protecting speech was based on statutory grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) Speech is protected on statutory grounds</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The First Amendment determines the contours of the unprotected categories of speech and proscribes Congress from prohibiting protected speech. Congress, however, need not prohibit unprotected speech to the extent allowed by the constitution or even prohibit any unprotected speech at all. The extent of speech prohibited by a constitutional statute must be contained within the contours of an unprotected category. Speech may thus fall into three categories: (a) protected by the constitution, (b) unprotected by the constitution and not prohibited by statute, and (c) unprotected by the constitution and prohibited by statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where a district court makes a purely statutory holding that specific speech is not prohibited by statute, the district court is holding only that Congress has chosen not to prohibit the speech in question. In such a situation, the district court is not deciding whether or not Congress could prohibit the speech in question, only that it chose not to. This purely statutory holding clearly has no bearing on the contours of unprotected categories of speech and thus no constitutional significance that would require heightened review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Below, the district court's holding that no reasonable jury could find the three images lascivious was a purely statutory holding. The district court did not consider the contours of the unprotected category of child pornography and thus did not consider whether the three images were unprotected speech. Thus, the district court held only that no reasonable jury could find that the three images violated the child pornography statute passed by Congress. Since no constitutional issue is present, First Amendment heightened review does not apply.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Considering the above, I respectfully disagree with the majority's reasoning in this case but join in the reversal of the district court's order excluding the three images from evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> The majority also notes that other circuits have described lascivious as a \"commonsensical term.\" While I agree that the meaning of lascivious is, in large part, a matter of common sense, I do not see how this precludes us from providing further guidance as to Congress' intent. Further, I reiterate that several circuits, including ours, have applied the<i>Dost</i> factors to supplement common sense. <i>See Amirault,</i> 173 F.3d at 31.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn19\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19_ref\">19</a>\n        <p> Other considerations could apply if the appeal raised First Amendment issues, but the only issue on appeal is whether the district court erred in holding that no reasonable jury could find that the three images are lascivious under the federal statute.

Such images would clearly satisfy the first prong of<i>Miller</i> in that they would appeal to the \"prurient interest\" and would satisfy the third prong in that they would not have \"serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\" <i>Miller v. California,</i> 413 U.S. 15, 24, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973). The images must then fail <i>Miller's</i> second prong and must not \"depict[] or describe[], in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law.\" <i>Id.</i> The Miller court included \"lewd exhibition of the genitals\" as an example of a valid definition of patently offensive sexual conduct. <i>Id.</i> at 25, 93 S.Ct. 2607. It is thus clear that such images of eighteen-year-old women could not be found to lewdly display the genitals.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn21\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21_ref\">21</a>\n        <p> The majority states that the district court \"gave the<i>Dost</i> factors greater weight than warranted\" and \"accorded to them the same status as the statutory definition itself.\" I do not see, however, how the district court's application of the <i>Dost</i> factors differed significantly from that of the <i>Amirault</i> court.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn22\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22_ref\">22</a>\n        <p> Moreover, it is not clear whether heightened First Amendment scrutiny applies at all to interlocutory appeals<i>See Seattle Times Co. v.

Each of the three photographs depicts a nude girl, who is posed alone and who is looking directly at the camera. Each girl appears on the cusp of puberty, either prepubescent or adolescent. The subjects of the photographs, who are of an age when girls normally are clothed even when in nature or in a stream, are completely unclothed (except for some jewelry), and the settings of the photographs provide no ready explanation that makes the nudity indisputably innocent. Moreover, in each photograph, a jury could reasonably conclude that there was an \"exhibition\" of the \"pubic area\": each of the girls' legs are parted and the pubic area is plainly visible. Indeed, the photos could reasonably be seen as focusing on or particularly drawing attention to the girls' pubic areas and, specifically, to their vaginas. A jury could reasonably conclude that none of the girls' postures were natural or spontaneous, that each girl was deliberately posed to exhibit her pubic area, and that the posture in which each was posed was not a comfortable one. As a jury will consider the images, we think the wisest course is to avoid more detailed description of them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the criteria under the statute and the constitutional limits set by <i>Ferber,</i> and our own review of the exhibits, we conclude that a reasonable jury could find that the three photographs constitute \"lascivious exhibitions of the genitals or pubic area\" within the meaning of the statute, and that the district court erred in taking the evidence away from the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Difficulties with the Analytical Methodology and the Use of the Dost Factors</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having held that the district court erred in its determination, under Rule 104(a), that no reasonable jury could find these images to be a lascivious display of the genitals or pubic area, we also express concern about the approach that the district court took in reaching its decision &#8212; an approach that, we recognize, was urged upon the court by the parties. In excluding the three exhibits, the court analyzed the question of whether to exclude the evidence almost exclusively in terms of the <i>Dost</i> factors, and, in our view, overemphasized those factors in a way which raised the risk of inappropriately limiting the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has described the <i>Dost</i> factors as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) whether the genitals or pubic area are the focal point of the image; (2) whether the setting of the image is sexually suggestive (i.e., a location generally associated with sexual activity); (3) whether the child is depicted in an unnatural pose or inappropriate attire considering her age; (4) whether the child is fully or partially clothed, or nude; (5) whether the image suggests sexual coyness or willingness to engage in sexual activity; and (6) whether the image is intended or designed to elicit a sexual response in the viewer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v.

We did not, however, suggest that the <i>Dost</i> factors were the equivalent of &#8212; or established the limits of &#8212; the statutory term \"lascivious.\" Indeed, we reached the opposite conclusion: \"[w]e emphasize[d] . . . that these factors are neither comprehensive nor necessarily applicable in every situation\" and that \"[t]he inquiry will always be case-specific.\" <i>Id.; see also United States v.

The court appeared to treat the <i>Dost</i> factors as exhaustive and to use them to set the boundaries of the statutory term \"lascivious.\" The court thus applied the six <i>Dost</i> factors in a way that accorded to them the same status as the statutory definition itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The consequence of the district court's unqualified application of the <i>Dost</i> factors was to take the issue of the lasciviousness of the three images away from a jury. None of the cases in which this court has referred to the <i>Dost</i> factors raised such a prospect.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> In <i>Amirault,</i> for example, the issue on appeal was whether the district court had properly increased the sentence, under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, of a defendant who had pleaded guilty to one count of possession of child pornography, by applying a cross-reference that resulted in a higher base-offense level if the crime involved trafficking in visual depictions of lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of a minor. 173 F.3d at 30-31. In <i>Amirault,</i> the task of interpreting and applying the Sentencing Guidelines was for the court, and any close \"judgment calls\" &#8212; and we noted that there were some &#8212; were the court's to make. <i>Id.</i> at 35. Indeed, the particular image on which the trafficking cross-reference was predicated was not one that had formed the basis of the conviction. <i>Id.</i> at 30.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No other circuit court, as best we can tell, has ever approved the use of the <i>Dost</i> factors in a pretrial proceeding to remove the consideration of the lasciviousness of an image from a jury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are many reasons for the need for caution about the use of the <i>Dost</i> factors, particularly in this way. First is the fact that the <i>Dost</i> factors have fostered myriad disputes that have led courts far afield from the statutory language. One dispute is, for example, how many of the factors must be present in an image for it to qualify as \"lascivious.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> <i>Compare, e.g., United States v. Wolf,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532623\"><a href=\"/opinion/532623/united-states-v-william-joseph-wolf/\"><span class=\"volume\">890</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">241</span></a></span>, 245 &amp; n. 6 (10th Cir.1989) (\"We do not hold that more than one <i>Dost</i> factor must be present . . . .\"), <i>with United States v.

Another dispute is about what the specific factors mean. <i>See, e.g., Amirault,</i> 173 F.3d at 34 (cataloging disagreement about what the sixth <i>Dost</i> factor means). As one commentator observed, \"the <i>Dost</i> test has produced a profoundly incoherent body of case law.\" A. Adler, <i>Inverting the First Amendment,</i> 149 U. Pa. L.Rev. 921, 953 (2001). There is every reason to avoid importing unnecessary interpretive conundrums into a statute, especially where the statute employs terms that lay people are perfectly capable of understanding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even more significantly, there is a risk that the <i>Dost</i> factors will be used to inappropriately <i>limit</i> the scope of the statutory definition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> That is impermissible. We offer two examples in which such a risk has been raised.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first example is one that was noted by the Ninth Circuit when affirming one of the convictions in the <i>Dost</i> case. In <i>United States v. Wiegand,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"483889\"><a href=\"/opinion/483889/united-states-v-edwin-e-wiegand/\"><span class=\"volume\">812</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1239</span></a></span>, the Ninth Circuit noted that the <i>Dost</i> factors were \"over-generous to the defendant.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1244. Specifically, the court took issue with the fifth factor articulated by the district court: \"whether the visual depiction suggests sexual coyness or a willingness to engage in sexual activity.\" <i>Dost,</i> 636 F.Supp. at 832. The appellate court expressed disapproval at \"[t]he standard employed by the district court[, which] . . . impl[ied] . . . that the pictures would not be lascivious unless they showed sexual activity or willingness to engage in it.\" <i>Wiegand,</i> 812 F.2d at 1244. Emphasizing that \"[t]he offense defined by the statute is depiction of a `lascivious exhibition of the genitals,'\" the appellate court held that it was enough that \"the pictures were an exhibition,\" \"[t]he exhibition was of the genitals,\" and \"[e]ach of the pictures featured the child photographed as a sexual object.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is obvious that if an image does depict a sexually alluring look from the minor, it will be easier to show that the image is lascivious. The absence of a sexual come-on, though, does not mean that an image is not lascivious, as <i>Wiegand</i> and other cases have noted. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Knox,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"676499\"><a href=\"/opinion/676499/united-states-v-stephen-a-knox/\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">733</span></a></span>, 747 (3d Cir.1994) (\"Children posing for pornographic pictures may suffer dramatic harm regardless of whether they have an `adult' look of sexual invitation or coyness on their face.\"); <i>Wolf,</i> 890 F.2d at 247 (noting that \"a sexually exploitative photograph of a child need not portray the victim in a pose that `depicts lust, wantonness, sexual coyness or other inappropriate precocity'\"). Children do not characteristically have countenances inviting sexual activity, and the statute does not presume that they do. By suggesting that the child subject must exhibit sexual coyness in order for an image to be lascivious, the district court in <i>Dost</i> ran the risk of limiting the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second example of how the <i>Dost</i> factors may risk limiting the statute manifested itself in this case. In its order, the district court overread <i>Amirault</i> as holding that a jury, in determining whether a given image constitutes a \"lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area,\" is limited to considering \"the objective criteria of the photograph's design,\" <i>Amirault,</i> 173 F.3d at 35 &#8212; what the district court called \"the four corners of the image\" &#8212; and nothing else.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> The district court erred in stating that this court has adopted a general \"four corners rule.\" <i>Amirault</i> did not adopt such a rule,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> and the text of the statute itself does not require it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue of the four corners rule, and even of what it means, has not been decided by this circuit, and we do not decide it here. The issue is complicated, and there are arguments going different ways. For example, it is clear that the jury may hear evidence about the circumstances of the production of an image in determining whether the child depicted therein is real. It is arguable that a jury should not be precluded from considering such evidence on the question of lasciviousness as well. The laws prohibiting possession of child pornography are constitutional because the government has a compelling interest in preventing sexual exploitation of children; it is not obvious that a jury cannot consider evidence of exactly that exploitation in evaluating the lasciviousness of the materials. <i>Cf. Free Speech Coal.,</i> 535 U.S. at 254, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118496\"><a href=\"/opinion/118496/ashcroft-v-free-speech-coalition/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1389</span></a></span> (noting that \"speech [that] had what the Court in effect held was a proximate link to the crime from which it came\" was not constitutionally protected). But there are also arguments, usually made in the context of the very different question of whether the subjective reaction or intent of the viewer should be taken into account when determining whether an image is lascivious, that lasciviousness should be determined from the image alone. <i>Cf. Villard,</i> 885 F.2d at 125 (holding, in the context of a sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenge to a jury verdict, that in evaluating the question of an image's lasciviousness, \"[w]e must . . . look at the photograph, rather than the viewer,\" because if \"we were to conclude that the photographs were lascivious merely because Villard found them sexually arousing, we would be engaging in conclusory bootstrapping\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue, however, has not been squarely presented to us in this case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> We flag it only to express concern that in deriving such a prohibition from <i>Dost</i> or from a misunderstanding of our case law, the district court ran the risk of impermissibly narrowing the scope of the statute by imposing upon the statute a limitation that was in no way compelled by the statutory text itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We stress that our holding today is limited: We do not hold that the <i>Dost</i> factors may never be used.

Clearly, the protection of children from sexual exploitation is \"a government objective of surpassing importance.\" <i>New York v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1113</span></a></span> (1982). The victims of child pornography can be harmed not only by the production of the pornography but also by the continued existence of the pornography on the Internet. <i>See id.</i> at 759-60, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110794\"><a href=\"/opinion/110794/new-york-v-ferber/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3348</span></a></span> &amp; n. 10. Furthermore, the existence of the pornography can be harmful to the child even if its production was not (e.g., if photographs were surreptitiously taken).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In passing and amending laws prohibiting child pornography, Congress has clearly been concerned with protecting children from harm. <i>See</i> Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-208, &#167; 121, 110 Stat. 3009, 3009-26 (1996) (finding that child pornography \"is a form of sexual abuse which can result in physical or psychological harm, or both, to the children involved.\"); Child Abuse Victims' Rights Act of 1986, Pub.L. No. 99-591, 100 Stat. 3341-74 (1986) (recognizing \"the physiological, psychological, and emotional harm caused by the production, distribution, and display of child pornography by strengthening laws prescribing such activity\"); Child Protection Act of 1984, Pub.L. No. 98-292, 98 Stat. 204 (1984) (finding that \"the use of children as subjects of pornographic materials is harmful to the physiological, emotional, and mental health of the individual child and to society\"). The government is prosecuting Defendant for violating 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2252. This statute is titled \"Certain activities relating to material involving the sexual exploitation of minors\" and is under the chapter titled \"SEXUAL EXPLOITATION AND OTHER ABUSE OF CHILDREN.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is my belief that Congress intended that the perceived harm to the depicted child by the production or existence of the picture be an essential factor in determining whether a picture lasciviously depicts the genitals or pubic area. While the <i>Dost</i> factors address the harm to the child in an oblique manner, I instead put the harm at the forefront of the analysis. <i>See Amirault,</i> 173 F.3d at 32 (stating that the <i>Dost</i> factors \"are neither comprehensive nor necessarily applicable in every situation\"). To the extent that the <i>Dost</i> factors address the harm to the child, they will be relevant to my analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The notion of what depictions are harmful to the child cannot help but be informed by cultural norms. While the act of exploiting a child is harmful by definition, certain displays of nudity may be harmful solely because they are socially unacceptable. These social norms are not universal. In some cultures, nudity may be commonplace while, in others, the appearance of a woman's eyes may be lascivious. <i>See Ferber,</i> 458 U.S. at 775, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110794\"><a href=\"/opinion/110794/new-york-v-ferber/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3348</span></a></span> (O'Connor, J., concurring) (noting the relevance of cultural norms to the harmfulness of a picture). These norms will also evolve over time. <i>See</i> Clay Calvert, <i>The Perplexing Problem of Child Modeling Web Sites: Quasi-Child Pornography and Calls for New Legislation,</i> 40 Cal. W.L.Rev. 231, 253-54 (2004). In prohibiting lascivious pictures of children, I believe Congress intended to prohibit pictures where, given our cultural norms, the content is harmful to the depicted child.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With these background principles in mind, I now address the three images that are the subject of this appeal. First, the age and developmental state of the depicted child is relevant to the harm caused and thus the lasciviousness of the images. A picture of a nude child is more likely to be harmful to the child when the depicted child is an adolescent or prepubescent rather than an infant. This is not because infants are beyond the perverse interests of pedophiles, but because nude pictures of infants are so widely approved in our culture that such pictures are less likely to cause harm to the child. The government has evidence that the depicted girls were ten to twelve years old at the time the pictures were taken, and the pictures are consistent with this evidence. Because a picture of a nude ten-to-twelve-year-old child is not socially acceptable, an exhibition of the child's genitals or pubic area is more likely to be harmful to the child.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the portrayal of the child must be considered in determining whether an image is lascivious. Analyzing the content of an image for sexually explicit content is a fractious issue. We have previously held that \"the statute requires more than mere nudity\" because otherwise \"the requirement of `lasciviousness' would be superfluous.\" <i>Amirault,</i> 173 F.3d at 33. Yet, other circuits have found that nudity is not required for a lascivious exhibition. <i>United States v. Horn,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765665\"><a href=\"/opinion/765665/united-states-v-robert-gerard-horn/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">781</span></a></span>, 789-90 (8th Cir.1999); <i>United States v.

In the three images, the girls are nude and their genitals are clearly visible. The girls are posing for the camera, but the poses are neutral in the sense that the images would be unremarkable if the girls were clothed. The images are in the form of a portrait as the girls' bodies are the focus of the image with nothing of significance in the background. The images are jarring, more because of the cultural taboo regarding nude pictures of prepubescent girls than because of the specific portrayal of the girls. In light of our cultural norms, the primary purpose of the three images appears to be the display of the girls' genitals. Regardless of whether or not the girls were exploited in the production of these images, the girls are being sexually exploited by the continued existence of these images.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I therefore believe that a reasonable jury could find that the three images lasciviously display the girls' genitals or pubic area in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2252(a)(4)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.

The majority states the statute \"needs no adornment\" and that \"[f]urther definitional guides are not required.\" I disagree with the majority's reasoning and believe that we need to provide greater clarity as to Congress' intent in prohibiting child pornography.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the constitutionality of the federal child pornography statute is not an issue on appeal, the majority notes that the federal statute meets the constitutional requirements set out in <i>Ferber, see</i> 458 U.S. at 764-66, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110794\"><a href=\"/opinion/110794/new-york-v-ferber/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In sum, the majority argues that, since the statute is constitutional, courts must not provide further guidance as to Congress' intent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> I fail to see, however, how the satisfaction of constitutional requirements precludes federal courts in appropriate circumstances from saying precisely \"what the law is.\" <i>Marbury v.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></span> (1803). Courts routinely interpret the meaning of constitutional statutes, and this being an \"appropriate circumstance,\" I see no reason to refrain from doing so here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The meanings of lewd and lascivious in the obscenity and child pornography statutes pose a difficult issue that requires clarification. If the girls depicted in the three images were eighteen years old and this case arose under an <i>obscenity statute,</i> it is beyond dispute that no reasonable jury could find that the images <i>lewdly</i> display the genitals.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> We are now proceeding under a <i>child pornography statute</i> and finding that a reasonable jury could find that the images <i>lasciviously</i> depict the genitals of the ten-to-twelve-year-old girls despite the fact that Supreme Court precedent suggests that <i>lewd and lascivious are synonymous. See United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117881\"><a href=\"/opinion/117881/united-states-v-x-citement-video-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span>, 78-79, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117881\"><a href=\"/opinion/117881/united-states-v-x-citement-video-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">372</span></a></span> (1994). Because these two outcomes do not blithely arise from the plain text of the statutes, judicial elaboration of the meanings of \"lewd\" and \"lascivious\" is necessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority's exhortation to eschew further elaboration of the meaning of lascivious also runs counter to our binding circuit precedent in <i>Amirault.</i> In <i>Amirault,</i> we directly and clearly stated that district courts may use the <i>Dost</i> factors in determining whether an image is lascivious. Section IV of the <i>Amirault</i> opinion begins: \"Using the <i>Dost</i> factors as guideposts, we turn now to the photograph to analyze whether it contains a lascivious exhibition of the genitals.\" <i>Amirault,</i> 173 F.3d at 33. The <i>Amirault</i> court then considered each of the <i>Dost</i> factors in turn and concluded that the image in question was not lascivious. <i>Id.</i> at 33-35. Below, the district court applied the <i>Dost</i> factors in the same way as we did in <i>Amirault.</i> The majority, in holding that the district court inappropriately applied the <i>Dost</i> factors,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> goes against <i>Amirault</i> and leaves First Circuit case law in a contradictory state.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority attempts &#8212; unconvincingly, in my view &#8212; to use procedural posture to distinguish the issue before us from other First Circuit cases applying the <i>Dost</i> factors. <i>See United States v. Hilton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199515\"><a href=\"/opinion/199515/united-states-v-hilton/\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 57-58 (1st Cir.2001) (applying the <i>Dost</i> factors at a sentencing hearing); <i>United States v. Brunette,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199491\"><a href=\"/opinion/199491/united-states-v-brunette/\"><span class=\"volume\">256</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 17-18 (1st Cir.2001) (applying the <i>Dost</i> factors in determining the validity of a search warrant); <i>Amirault,</i> 173 F.3d at 30-31 (applying the <i>Dost</i> factors at a sentencing hearing). The majority is correct in noting that no circuit court has approved the use of the <i>Dost</i> factors to exclude evidence on the grounds that no reasonable jury could find the images lascivious, but no circuit court has disapproved of such use either. In my view, the <i>Dost</i> factors are either relevant or they are not. If the <i>Dost</i> factors are relevant in determining whether images are lascivious in the context of a sentencing hearing, then they are also relevant in determining whether a reasonable jury could find that images are lascivious in a hearing to exclude evidence before trial. The majority has not provided any persuasive rationale for such a distinction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The four corners rule in determining lasciviousness</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In discussing the deficiencies of the <i>Dost</i> factors, the majority criticized the district court for applying the \"four corners rule\" whereby factors external to the actual image, such as the circumstances surrounding the production of the image, are excluded from the determination as to whether an image is lascivious. I agree with the majority that <i>Amirault</i> did not adopt such a rule, but I disagree with the majority's suggestion that the jury could consider the circumstances of the production of the image in determining lasciviousness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the plain language of the statute is generally consistent with the four corners rule. The statute prohibits the knowing possession of five specifically defined types of visual depictions. In determining whether the possession of an image violates the statute, the fact finder must examine the content of the image. The circumstances of the production of the image are relevant to punishing the producer of the image but are of dubious relevance in punishing the possessor of the image, who is likely ignorant of the details of its production.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the use of factors beyond the four corners of the image in punishing the possessor of the image creates serious constitutional concerns. The Court in <i>Ferber</i> made clear that \"criminal responsibility may not be imposed [for possession of child pornography] without some element of scienter on the part of the defendant.\" 458 U.S. at 765, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110794\"><a href=\"/opinion/110794/new-york-v-ferber/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3348</span></a></span>. Where the possessor of an image is ignorant of the circumstances of the production of the image, the scienter requirement may be violated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While I would not categorically prohibit any evidence beyond the four corners of the image, only in rare situations will such evidence be relevant and not offend constitutional requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Description of the images</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority's description of the three images contradicts the description given by the district court. I would adopt the district court's description of the images because it is more accurate. According to the majority, a reasonable jury could find that the images \"focus[] or particularly draw[] attention to the girls' . . . vaginas\" and that \"each girl was deliberately posed to exhibit her pubic area.\" The majority further states that the girls' postures are not \"particularly natural or spontaneous\" and were not \"comfortable.\" In contrast, the district court found that the \"genitals or pubic area [were not] the focal point\" of the images, that the \"setting [was not] sexually suggestive at all,\" and that the poses were not \"unnatural.\" My description of the images, above, comports with the description given by the district court and more accurately represents the images than does the majority's description.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Standard of review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I agree with the majority that we review <i>de novo</i> the district court's holding that no reasonable jury could find the three images lascivious and also agree with the majority's reasoning. The majority's justification for <i>de novo</i> review, however, is not the justification proffered by the parties. Both parties argued that the First Amendment demands heightened review of the district court's holding. The majority did not consider this rationale, and I write further to state explicitly that First Amendment heightened review does not apply to this case. It is illustrative to consider three scenarios: the district court holds that (1) speech is unprotected; (2) speech is protected on constitutional grounds; and (3) speech is protected on statutory grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) Speech is unprotected</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well established that \"in cases raising First Amendment issues . . . an appellate court has an obligation to make an independent examination of the whole record in order to make sure that the judgment does not constitute a <i>forbidden intrusion on the field of free expression.</i>\" <i>Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111164\"><a href=\"/opinion/111164/bose-corp-v-consumers-union-of-united-states-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">485</span></a></span>, 499, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111164\"><a href=\"/opinion/111164/bose-corp-v-consumers-union-of-united-states-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span> (1984) (emphasis added and internal quotation marks omitted). The appellate court must \"be sure that the speech in question actually falls within the unprotected category and . . . confine the perimeters of any unprotected category within acceptably narrow limits . . . to ensure that protected expression will not be inhibited.\" <i>Id.</i> at 505, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111164\"><a href=\"/opinion/111164/bose-corp-v-consumers-union-of-united-states-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1949</span></a></span>. There is no need to distinguish whether a district court held speech unprotected on statutory or constitutional grounds, because the former implies the latter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) Speech is protected on constitutional grounds</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The role of the appellate court is less clear where the district court holds that speech is protected on constitutional grounds. Some circuits have held that heightened First Amendment review is only necessary to protect speech and does not apply where the speech has already been protected. <i>See Multimedia Publishing Co. v. Greenville-Spartanburg Airport Dist.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"604842\"><a href=\"/opinion/604842/multimedia-publishing-company-of-south-carolina-incorporated-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">991</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></a></span>, 160 (4th Cir.1993); <i>Daily Herald Co. v.

Other circuits have applied heightened review to all constitutional holdings defining the perimeters of unprotected categories of speech, regardless of whether the lower court held that speech was protected or unprotected. <i>See Don's Porta Signs, Inc. v. City of Clearwater,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"494720\"><a href=\"/opinion/494720/dons-porta-signs-inc-west-coast-sign-co-ltd-signs-by-design-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">829</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1051</span></a></span>, 1053 n. 9 (11th Cir.1987); <i>Lindsay v.

We have yet to address the issue, and we need not address it now since the court's holding protecting speech was based on statutory grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) Speech is protected on statutory grounds</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The First Amendment determines the contours of the unprotected categories of speech and proscribes Congress from prohibiting protected speech. Congress, however, need not prohibit unprotected speech to the extent allowed by the constitution or even prohibit any unprotected speech at all. The extent of speech prohibited by a constitutional statute must be contained within the contours of an unprotected category. Speech may thus fall into three categories: (a) protected by the constitution, (b) unprotected by the constitution and not prohibited by statute, and (c) unprotected by the constitution and prohibited by statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where a district court makes a purely statutory holding that specific speech is not prohibited by statute, the district court is holding only that Congress has chosen not to prohibit the speech in question. In such a situation, the district court is not deciding whether or not Congress could prohibit the speech in question, only that it chose not to. This purely statutory holding clearly has no bearing on the contours of unprotected categories of speech and thus no constitutional significance that would require heightened review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Below, the district court's holding that no reasonable jury could find the three images lascivious was a purely statutory holding. The district court did not consider the contours of the unprotected category of child pornography and thus did not consider whether the three images were unprotected speech. Thus, the district court held only that no reasonable jury could find that the three images violated the child pornography statute passed by Congress. Since no constitutional issue is present, First Amendment heightened review does not apply.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Considering the above, I respectfully disagree with the majority's reasoning in this case but join in the reversal of the district court's order excluding the three images from evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> The majority also notes that other circuits have described lascivious as a \"commonsensical term.\" While I agree that the meaning of lascivious is, in large part, a matter of common sense, I do not see how this precludes us from providing further guidance as to Congress' intent. Further, I reiterate that several circuits, including ours, have applied the<i>Dost</i> factors to supplement common sense. <i>See Amirault,</i> 173 F.3d at 31.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn19\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19_ref\">19</a>\n        <p> Other considerations could apply if the appeal raised First Amendment issues, but the only issue on appeal is whether the district court erred in holding that no reasonable jury could find that the three images are lascivious under the federal statute. In discussing the standard of review, below, I explain in more detail why there is no constitutional question present on appeal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn20\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20_ref\">20</a>\n        <p> Because such images could not be obscene they could not be found to lewdly display the genitals. Such images would clearly satisfy the first prong of<i>Miller</i> in that they would appeal to the \"prurient interest\" and would satisfy the third prong in that they would not have \"serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\" <i>Miller v.
