Steven J. McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                        Lynch, Chief Judge,\n                Selya and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Bjorn Lange, Assistant Federal Public Defender, for appellant.\n     Aixa Maldonado-Quiñones, Assistant United States Attorney,\nwith whom Thomas P. Colantuono, United States Attorney was on\nbrief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                        December 22, 2008\n\f            SELYA, Circuit Judge.      This single-issue criminal appeal\n\nraises a question of first impression in this circuit: Does the\n\nSentencing Commission's recent amendment to the drug quantity\n\ntable, USSG App. C, Amend. 706 (2007), offer a potential remedy to\n\na defendant who, although convicted of a drug-trafficking offense\n\ninvolving crack cocaine, was ultimately sentenced as a career\n\noffender?     The   district   court    answered   that    question    in   the\n\nnegative, concluding that the amendment does not benefit the\n\ndefendant in the circumstances of this case.         We affirm the denial\n\nof the defendant's motion for a reduced sentence.1\n\n            The facts and posture of the case are straightforward.\n\nOn April 6, 2005, defendant-appellant Luis Caraballo pleaded guilty\n\nto   two   counts   of   possessing    crack   cocaine     with   intent     to\n\ndistribute.     See 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1).               The district court\n\ncomputed the guideline sentencing range as follows.               It started\n\nwith a base offense level of 22, premised on a drug quantity of\n\n3.65 grams of crack cocaine.     See USSG §2D1.1.        Concluding that the\n\ndefendant's criminal record qualified him as a career offender, id.\n\n§4B1.1(a), the court performed the alternate calculation required\n\nby   the   career   offender   guideline,   see    id.    §4B1.1(b).        That\n\n\n\n      1\n       This case was consolidated with United States v. Ayala-\nPizarro, No. 08-1321, and argued in this court on November 5, 2008.\nAlthough the issue presented in both appeals is substantially\nidentical, we opt to decide the cases separately.      This is the\nfirst of the decisions; an opinion in Ayala-Pizarro will issue\nshortly.\n\n                                      -2-\n\falternate calculation implicated a higher base offense level (32)\n\nthan the non-career-offender calculation (22).              Consequently, as\n\nprescribed in the career offender guideline, id. §4B1.1(b), the\n\ncourt employed the enhanced offense level.              It then applied a\n\nthree-level credit for acceptance of responsibility.                 See id.\n\n§3E1.1.    These adjustments yielded a guideline sentencing range of\n\n151 to 188 months.\n\n            On September 7, 2005, the district court convened the\n\ndisposition hearing.       The court announced its view that the career\n\noffender calculations controlled.          The defendant did not challenge\n\nthe   court's   decision    to   invoke    the   enhanced   career   offender\n\nsentencing range.    Instead, he argued for a downwardly variant 48-\n\nmonth sentence under the aegis of United States v. Booker, 543 U.S.\n\n220, 245-46 (2005).    The defendant premised his plea primarily on\n\nhis deteriorating health.\n\n            The district court granted a less generous variance and\n\nsentenced the defendant to a 108-month incarcerative term on each\n\ncount, to run concurrently, together with three years of supervised\n\nrelease.    The defendant appealed.         We denied relief, finding the\n\nsentence reasonable.       United States v. Caraballo, 447 F.3d 26, 28\n\n(1st Cir. 2006).\n\n            For many years before and after the imposition of the\n\ndefendant's sentence, a vigorous debate had been waged about the\n\nrelatively heavy level of punishment associated with crack cocaine\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\foffenses as compared to the somewhat lighter level of punishment\n\nassociated with crimes involving powdered cocaine.           See, e.g.,\n\nKimbrough v. United States, 128 S. Ct. 558, 568-70 (2007) (limning\n\nthe history of this debate); United States v. Pho, 433 F.3d 53, 54-\n\n57 (1st Cir. 2006) (similar).      On November 1, 2007, the Sentencing\n\nCommission took definitive action by revising a portion of the drug\n\nquantity table.   See USSG App. C, Amend. 706 (2007).         Generally\n\nspeaking, Amendment 706 adjusts downward by two levels the base\n\noffense level ascribed to various quantities of crack cocaine under\n\nUSSG §2D1.1(c), thereby shrinking the guideline disparity between\n\ncrack cocaine offenses and powdered cocaine offenses.           Shortly\n\nafter promulgating Amendment 706, the Commission imbued it with\n\nretroactive effect.    See USSG App. C, Amend. 713 (Supp. May 1,\n\n2008).\n\n          Cognizant   of   these   developments,   the   defendant   lost\n\nlittle time in filing a motion for reduction of his sentence.          He\n\nclaimed that his sentence derived from the drug quantity table for\n\ncrack cocaine; that Amendment 706 has altered that guideline; and\n\nthat, therefore, he was eligible for a shorter sentence.2            As a\n\n\n\n\n     2\n       Technically speaking, Amendment 706 modifies the drug\nquantity table.     Its effect, however, is to mitigate the\nrecommended guideline sentencing ranges for offenses involving\ncrack cocaine.   For ease in exposition, we shall refer to the\naffected portion of the drug quantity table as \"the crack cocaine\nguideline.\"\n\n                                   -4-\n\fvehicle for the achievement of that goal, he identified 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3582(c)(2) (quoted infra).\n\n            The district court did not agree that section 3582(c)(2)\n\napplied.    Noting that the defendant had been sentenced as a career\n\noffender, the court found that it lacked authority to reconsider\n\nthe sentence.         Accordingly, the court denied the defendant's\n\nmotion.    United States v. Caraballo, No. 04-CR-035-01 (D.N.H. Apr.\n\n23, 2008) (unpublished order).             This timely appeal followed.\n\n            We review a district court's denial of a motion for\n\nreduction     of    sentence    under      section   3582(c)(2)     for    abuse   of\n\ndiscretion.        United States v. Rodríguez-Peña, 470 F.3d 431, 432\n\n(1st Cir. 2006) (per curiam).           A material error of law is perforce\n\nan abuse of discretion.         United States v. Snyder, 136 F.3d 65, 67\n\n(1st   Cir.    1998).      That       subsidiary     doctrine     has     particular\n\npertinence here: this case requires us to determine, as a threshold\n\nmatter, whether the district court had authority to act under\n\nsection    3582(c)(2).         That   is    purely   a   question   of     statutory\n\ninterpretation and, to that extent, the court's answer to it\n\nengenders de novo review.             See United States v. Leahy, 473 F.3d\n\n401, 405 (1st Cir. 2007); United States v. Gibbens, 25 F.3d 28, 32\n\n(1st Cir. 1994).\n\n            Finality is an important attribute of judgments and,\n\ntypically, once a pronounced sentence in a criminal case becomes\n\nfinal and unappealable, it may not be modified.                 See, e.g., United\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\fStates v. Lawrence, 535 F.3d 631, 637 (7th Cir. 2008); United\n\nStates v. Jordan, 162 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1998); see also 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3582(c).   But this general rule, like virtually every general\n\nrule, admits of exceptions.     One such exception is embodied in the\n\nstatute alluded to above, which provides in relevant part that:\n\n           in the case of a defendant who has been\n           sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a\n           sentencing range that has subsequently been\n           lowered by the Sentencing Commission . . . the\n           court may reduce the term of imprisonment,\n           after considering the factors set forth in\n           section 3553(a) to the extent that they are\n           applicable, if such a reduction is consistent\n           with applicable policy statements issued by\n           the Sentencing Commission.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2).     In enacting this statute, Congress spoke\n\nwith unmistakable clarity: before a district court can consider a\n\nsentence modification thereunder, it must satisfy itself that the\n\noriginal   sentence   was   \"based   on    a   sentencing   range   that   has\n\nsubsequently been lowered.\"     Id. (emphasis supplied).\n\n           In the case at hand, the defendant acknowledges that the\n\nlower court sentenced him as a career offender, and he eschews any\n\nchallenge to that designation. He nonetheless maintains that his\n\nsentence was \"based on\" the crack cocaine guideline, USSG §2D1.1,\n\nbecause the court used that guideline in the series of calculations\n\nleading up to its production of the sentencing range that it\n\nultimately found applicable.\n\n           Refined to bare essence, the defendant's suggestion is\n\nthat, even though his sentence was not dictated exclusively by the\n\n                                     -6-\n\fcrack cocaine guideline, it was \"based on\" that guideline because\n\nthat guideline was a way station along the road that the district\n\ncourt traveled in arriving at the appropriate sentencing range. He\n\ninsists that, given this imbrication, Amendment 706 unlocks section\n\n3582(c)(2) and authorizes the district court, on his motion, to\n\nrecalculate his sentencing range and determine anew, in light of\n\ngenerally applicable sentencing factors, see 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a),\n\nwhether a sentence reduction is warranted.\n\n              We are not persuaded.            Here, the district court first\n\ndetermined the offense level applicable to the underlying drug-\n\ntrafficking offenses, using the crack cocaine guideline.                       It then\n\ndetermined      the   alternate     offense         level     resulting      from    the\n\ndefendant's status as a career offender.                Only then did it choose\n\nthe   offense      level   that   it    actually       used    in    sentencing     the\n\ndefendant: the enhanced career offender level.\n\n              The defendant's argument that this oblique reference to\n\nthe   crack     cocaine    guideline         was    enough    to    trigger    section\n\n3582(c)(2)     disregards     the      way    in    which    the    career     offender\n\nguideline operates.        As we explained in United States v. Ventura,\n\n353   F.3d    84   (1st    Cir.   2003),      the    career    offender       guideline\n\nincorporates its own sentencing table.                Id. at 90.      If the offense\n\nlevel for a career offender from that table \"is greater than the\n\noffense level otherwise applicable, the offense level from the\n\n[career offender] table . . . shall apply.\"                  USSG §4B1.1(b).        That\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fusually will be the case, since the career offender guideline \"sets\n\nforth    a   tabulation      of   offense    levels    that     are   determined      by\n\nreference to the statutory maximum sentences authorized for various\n\noffenses of conviction.\"           Ventura, 353 F.3d at 90.\n\n               Given this architecture, the sentencing court's authority\n\nis severely limited in career offender cases:\n\n               [T]he   sentencing   court   must   take   the\n               applicable offense level from the career\n               offender table and compare it to the offense\n               level that would be applicable absent a career\n               offender designation. If the former exceeds\n               the latter, the court must use it in\n               determining    the   defendant's    [guideline\n               sentencing range].\n\nId. (emphasis supplied).\n\n               This   case   hewed   to     the    normal     pattern:      the   career\n\noffender guideline provided the higher offense level and, thus,\n\nyielded a more punitive sentencing range.                  That was the range that\n\nthe district court actually used at sentencing.                   Consequently, to\n\nsay that the defendant's sentence was \"based on\" the crack cocaine\n\nguideline strains credulity. Reaching that result would require us\n\nto   rewrite      section     3582(c)(2)      and,    in    the   bargain,        invade\n\nCongress's exclusive preserve.\n\n               Nor is there room for any legitimate doubt.                  In drafting\n\nsection 3582(c)(2), Congress has not sounded an uncertain trumpet\n\nbut, rather, has couched the statute in plain and unambiguous\n\nlanguage. The term \"sentencing range\" clearly contemplates the end\n\nresult    of    the   overall     guideline       calculus,    not    the    series   of\n\n                                          -8-\n\ftentative     results      reached       at    various      interim      steps   in   the\n\nperformance of that calculus. Thus, if an amended guideline does\n\nnot have the effect of lowering the sentencing range actually used\n\nat sentencing, the defendant's sentence was not based on that range\n\nwithin the intendment of the statute.\n\n            We add three embellishments.                  First, our \"plain meaning\"\n\nconstruction of section 3582(c)(2) comports with the authorities\n\nelsewhere.       Three other courts of appeals have addressed this\n\nprecise question, and each of them has read the statute in the same\n\nmanner as do we.       See United States v. Sharkey, 543 F.3d 1236, 1239\n\n(10th Cir. 2008); United States v. Moore, 541 F.3d 1323, 1328 (11th\n\nCir. 2008); United States v. Tingle, 524 F.3d 839, 840 (8th Cir.\n\n2008) (per curiam).\n\n            Second,       our     construction        of    section      3582(c)(2)   is\n\nentirely     consistent         with   the     Sentencing      Commission's       policy\n\nstatements.      See, e.g., USSG §1B1.10(a)(2)(B) (made effective on\n\nMarch 3, 2008, by Amendment 712) (explaining that a sentence\n\nreduction \"is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) if — an\n\namendment    .   .    .   does     not   have       the    effect   of    lowering    the\n\ndefendant's applicable guideline range\").                    The defendant urges us\n\nto ignore this policy statement as merely advisory in a post-Booker\n\nworld — but Booker neither undermined the continued vitality of\n\nsection 3582(c)(2) nor altered the customary canons of statutory\n\nconstruction.        See United States v. Wise, 515 F.3d 207, 221 n.11\n\n\n                                              -9-\n\f(3d Cir. 2008) (reasoning that nothing in Booker \"purported to\n\nobviate the congressional directive on whether a sentence could be\n\nreduced based on subsequent changes in the Guidelines\"). The plain\n\nlanguage of the statute drives the result here.\n\n           Third, our conclusion here is fortified by our decision\n\nin United States v. Hickey, 280 F.3d 65 (1st Cir. 2002).              There,\n\nthe defendant had been found guilty of both an armed robbery and a\n\nfirearms offense.    Id. at 66.    Nevertheless, he was sentenced as a\n\ncareer offender.    Id.\n\n           After sentence was imposed, the Sentencing Commission\n\npromulgated   a   clarifying   amendment   mitigating      the   recommended\n\npunishment for this combination of underlying offenses. See id. at\n\n66-67 (citing USSG App. C, Amend. 599 (2000)). Hickey sought a\n\nsentence   reduction   but   we   ruled   that   section   3582(c)(2)   was\n\nunavailable because his sentence had been based on the career\n\noffender offense level and the resulting sentencing range, not the\n\noffense levels and sentencing ranges for the underlying offenses.\n\nSee id. at 69.\n\n           Hickey stands for the proposition that a sentencing court\n\nhas no authority to entertain a sentence reduction motion under\n\nsection 3582(c)(2) when the guideline amendment in question does\n\nnot affect the guideline sentencing range actually used by the\n\nsentencing court.      Id.     Our decision today tracks the Hickey\n\ncourt's reasoning and emulates its result.\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\f           We succinctly summarize. Had the new guideline provision\n\nfor crack cocaine offenses (Amendment 706) been in effect when this\n\ndefendant was sentenced, that provision would not have had any\n\neffect on the sentencing range actually used.      As we have said, the\n\ndefendant's actual sentencing range was produced by reference to\n\nsection 4A1.1 (the career offender guideline), not section 2D1.1\n\n(the crack cocaine guideline).     Thus, Amendment 706 did not lower\n\nthe   defendant's   actual   sentencing   range.    Consequently,   the\n\ndistrict court did not err in determining that it lacked the\n\nauthority to modify the defendant's sentence under 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3582(c)(2).\n\n           The defendant has a fallback position.       He asseverates\n\nthat he is eligible for a sentence reduction because the district\n\ncourt originally imposed a non-guideline sentence after granting\n\nhis plea for a downward variance.       With this in mind, he suggests\n\nthat the underlying offense conduct drove his sentence, not merely\n\nthe career offender guideline.       To bolster this suggestion, he\n\nnotes that the district court remarked at sentencing that the\n\noffense of conviction was \"basically [a] routine streetsweeper\n\ntype\" drug offense. In the defendant's view, this remark indicates\n\nthat the court was relying on the severity of the underlying crack\n\ncocaine crime to fix his sentence.\n\n           This argument lacks force.     For one thing, the defendant\n\nplaces more weight on the district court's remark than that remark\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fcan bear.       As we explained on direct review and today reaffirm, the\n\ncourt's \"primary rationale for imposing a sentence below the\n\nguideline sentencing range\" was not the nature of the offense\n\nconduct but, rather, the defendant's \"medical condition, which [the\n\ncourt]     characterized          as   'obviously        a    serious      situation.'\"\n\nCaraballo, 447 F.3d at 27.\n\n                Perhaps    more    importantly,     even      though    the     defendant\n\nreceived a non-guideline sentence, that had no effect on the\n\nsentencing range applicable in his case (i.e., the sentencing range\n\ncontemplated by section 3582(c)).                  Under an advisory guidelines\n\nsystem, a variance is granted in the sentencing court's discretion\n\nafter     the    court    has     established      an    appropriately        calculated\n\nguideline sentencing range.

Colantuono, United States Attorney was on brief, for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, Chief Judge, SELYA and BOUDIN, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>SELYA, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>This single-issue criminal appeal raises a question of first impression in this circuit: Does the Sentencing Commission's recent amendment to the drug quantity table, USSG App. C, Amend. 706 (2007), offer a potential remedy to a defendant who, although convicted of a drug-trafficking offense involving crack cocaine, was ultimately sentenced as a career offender? The district court answered that question in the negative, concluding that the amendment does not benefit the defendant in the circumstances of this case. We affirm the denial of the defendant's motion for a reduced sentence.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>The facts and posture of the case are straightforward. On April 6, 2005, defendant-appellant Luis Caraballo pleaded guilty to two counts of possessing crack cocaine with intent to distribute. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1). The district court computed the guideline sentencing range as follows. It started with a base offense level of 22, premised on a drug quantity of 3.65 grams of crack cocaine. <i>See</i> USSG § 2D1.1. Concluding that the defendant's criminal record qualified him as a career offender, <i>id.</i> § 4B1.1(a), the court performed the alternate calculation required by the career offender guideline, <i>see id.</i> § 4B1.1(b). That alternate calculation implicated a higher base offense level (32) than the non-career-offender calculation (22). Consequently, as prescribed in the career offender guideline, <i>id.</i> § 4B1.1(b), <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> the court employed the enhanced offense level. It then applied a three-level credit for acceptance of responsibility. <i>See id.</i> § 3E1.1. These adjustments yielded a guideline sentencing range of 151 to 188 months.</p>\n<p>On September 7, 2005, the district court convened the disposition hearing. The court announced its view that the career offender calculations controlled. The defendant did not challenge the court's decision to invoke the enhanced career offender sentencing range. Instead, he argued for a downwardly variant 48-month sentence under the aegis of <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 245-46, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The defendant premised his plea primarily on his deteriorating health.</p>\n<p>The district court granted a less generous variance and sentenced the defendant to a 108-month incarcerative term on each count, to run concurrently, together with three years of supervised release. The defendant appealed. We denied relief, finding the sentence reasonable. <i>United States v. Caraballo,</i> 447 F.3d 26, 28 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>For many years before and after the imposition of the defendant's sentence, a vigorous debate had been waged about the relatively heavy level of punishment associated with crack cocaine offenses as compared to the somewhat lighter level of punishment associated with crimes involving powdered cocaine. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Kimbrough v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 558, 568-70, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007) (limning the history of this debate); <i>United States v. Pho,</i> 433 F.3d 53, 54-57 (1st Cir.2006) (similar). On November 1, 2007, the Sentencing Commission took definitive action by revising a portion of the drug quantity table. <i>See</i> USSG App. C, Amend. 706 (2007). Generally speaking, Amendment 706 adjusts downward by two levels the base offense level ascribed to various quantities of crack cocaine under USSG § 2D1.1(c), thereby shrinking the guideline disparity between crack cocaine offenses and powdered cocaine offenses. Shortly after promulgating Amendment 706, the Commission imbued it with retroactive effect. <i>See</i> USSG App. C, Amend. 713 (Supp. May 1, 2008).</p>\n<p>Cognizant of these developments, the defendant lost little time in filing a motion for reduction of his sentence. He claimed that his sentence derived from the drug quantity table for crack cocaine; that Amendment 706 has altered that guideline; and that, therefore, he was eligible for a shorter sentence.<sup>[2]</sup> As a vehicle for the achievement of that goal, he identified 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) (quoted <i>infra</i>).</p>\n<p>The district court did not agree that section 3582(c)(2) applied. Noting that the defendant had been sentenced as a career offender, the court found that it lacked authority to reconsider the sentence. Accordingly, the court denied the defendant's motion. <i>United States v. Caraballo,</i> No. 04-CR-035-01 (D.N.H. Apr. 23, 2008) (unpublished order). This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p>We review a district court's denial of a motion for reduction of sentence under section 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Rodríguez-Peña,</i> 470 F.3d 431, 432 (1st Cir.2006) (per curiam). A material error of law is perforce an abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Snyder,</i> 136 F.3d 65, 67 (1st <span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> Cir.1998). That subsidiary doctrine has particular pertinence here: this case requires us to determine, as a threshold matter, whether the district court had authority to act under section 3582(c)(2). That is purely a question of statutory interpretation and, to that extent, the court's answer to it engenders de novo review. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Leahy,</i> 473 F.3d 401, 405 (1st Cir.2007); <i>United States v. Gibbens,</i> 25 F.3d 28, 32 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n<p>Finality is an important attribute of judgments and, typically, once a pronounced sentence in a criminal case becomes final and unappealable, it may not be modified. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Lawrence,</i> 535 F.3d 631, 637 (7th Cir. 2008); <i>United States v. Jordan,</i> 162 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1998); <i>see also</i> 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c). But this general rule, like virtually every general rule, admits of exceptions. One such exception is embodied in the statute alluded to above, which provides in relevant part that:</p>\n<blockquote>in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission ... the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p>18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2). In enacting this statute, Congress spoke with unmistakable clarity: before a district court can consider a sentence modification thereunder, it must satisfy itself that the original sentence was \"<i>based on</i> a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p>In the case at hand, the defendant acknowledges that the lower court sentenced him as a career offender, and he eschews any challenge to that designation. He nonetheless maintains that his sentence was \"based on\" the crack cocaine guideline, USSG § 2D1.1, because the court used that guideline in the series of calculations leading up to its production of the sentencing range that it ultimately found applicable.</p>\n<p>Refined to bare essence, the defendant's suggestion is that, even though his sentence was not dictated exclusively by the crack cocaine guideline, it was \"based on\" that guideline because that guideline was a way station along the road that the district court traveled in arriving at the appropriate sentencing range. He insists that, given this imbrication, Amendment 706 unlocks section 3582(c)(2) and authorizes the district court, on his motion, to recalculate his sentencing range and determine anew, in light of generally applicable sentencing factors, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), whether a sentence reduction is warranted.</p>\n<p>We are not persuaded. Here, the district court first determined the offense level applicable to the underlying drug-trafficking offenses, using the crack cocaine guideline. It then determined the alternate offense level resulting from the defendant's status as a career offender. Only then did it choose the offense level that it actually used in sentencing the defendant: the enhanced career offender level.</p>\n<p>The defendant's argument that this oblique reference to the crack cocaine guideline was enough to trigger section 3582(c)(2) disregards the way in which the career offender guideline operates. As we explained in <i>United States v. Ventura,</i> 353 F.3d 84 (1st Cir.2003), the career offender guideline incorporates its own sentencing table. <i>Id.</i> at 90. If the offense level for a career offender <i>from that table</i> \"is greater than the offense level otherwise applicable, the offense level from the [career offender] <span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> table ... shall apply.\" USSG § 4B1.1(b). That usually will be the case, since the career offender guideline \"sets forth a tabulation of offense levels that are determined by reference to the statutory maximum sentences authorized for various offenses of conviction.\" <i>Ventura,</i> 353 F.3d at 90.</p>\n<p>Given this architecture, the sentencing court's authority is severely limited in career offender cases:</p>\n<blockquote>[T]he sentencing court <i>must</i> take the applicable offense level from the career offender table and compare it to the offense level that would be applicable absent a career offender designation. If the former exceeds the latter, the court <i>must</i> use it in determining the defendant's [guideline sentencing range].</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p>This case hewed to the normal pattern: the career offender guideline provided the higher offense level and, thus, yielded a more punitive sentencing range. That was the range that the district court actually used at sentencing. Consequently, to say that the defendant's sentence was \"based on\" the crack cocaine guideline strains credulity. Reaching that result would require us to rewrite section 3582(c)(2) and, in the bargain, invade Congress's exclusive preserve.</p>\n<p>Nor is there room for any legitimate doubt. In drafting section 3582(c)(2), Congress has not sounded an uncertain trumpet but, rather, has couched the statute in plain and unambiguous language. The term \"sentencing range\" clearly contemplates the end result of the overall guideline calculus, not the series of tentative results reached at various interim steps in the performance of that calculus. Thus, if an amended guideline does not have the effect of lowering the sentencing range actually used at sentencing, the defendant's sentence was not based on that range within the intendment of the statute.</p>\n<p>We add three embellishments. First, our \"plain meaning\" construction of section 3582(c)(2) comports with the authorities elsewhere. Three other courts of appeals have addressed this precise question, and each of them has read the statute in the same manner as do we. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Sharkey,</i> 543 F.3d 1236, 1239 (10th Cir. 2008); <i>United States v. Moore,</i> 541 F.3d 1323, 1328 (11th Cir.2008); <i>United States v. Tingle,</i> 524 F.3d 839, 840 (8th Cir.2008) (per curiam).</p>\n<p>Second, our construction of section 3582(c)(2) is entirely consistent with the Sentencing Commission's policy statements. <i>See, e.g.,</i> USSG § 1B1.10(a)(2)(B) (made effective on March 3, 2008, by Amendment 712) (explaining that a sentence reduction \"is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) if  an amendment ... does not have the effect of lowering the defendant's applicable guideline range\"). The defendant urges us to ignore this policy statement as merely advisory in a post-<i>Booker</i> world  but <i>Booker</i> neither undermined the continued vitality of section 3582(c)(2) nor altered the customary canons of statutory construction. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Wise,</i> 515 F.3d 207, 221 n. 11 (3d Cir.2008) (reasoning that nothing in <i>Booker</i> \"purported to obviate the congressional directive on whether a sentence could be reduced based on subsequent changes in the Guidelines\"). The plain language of the statute drives the result here.</p>\n<p>Third, our conclusion here is fortified by our decision in <i>United States v. Hickey,</i> 280 F.3d 65 (1st Cir.2002). There, the defendant had been found guilty of both an armed robbery and a firearms offense. <i>Id.</i> at 66. Nevertheless, he was sentenced as a career offender. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>After sentence was imposed, the Sentencing Commission promulgated a clarifying <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> amendment mitigating the recommended punishment for this combination of underlying offenses. <i>See id.</i> at 66-67 (citing USSG App. C, Amend. 599 (2000)). Hickey sought a sentence reduction but we ruled that section 3582(c)(2) was unavailable because his sentence had been based on the career offender offense level and the resulting sentencing range, not the offense levels and sentencing ranges for the underlying offenses. <i>See id.</i> at 69.</p>\n<p><i>Hickey</i> stands for the proposition that a sentencing court has no authority to entertain a sentence reduction motion under section 3582(c)(2) when the guideline amendment in question does not affect the guideline sentencing range actually used by the sentencing court. <i>Id.</i> Our decision today tracks the <i>Hickey</i> court's reasoning and emulates its result.</p>\n<p>We succinctly summarize. Had the new guideline provision for crack cocaine offenses (Amendment 706) been in effect when this defendant was sentenced, that provision would not have had any effect on the sentencing range actually used. As we have said, the defendant's actual sentencing range was produced by reference to section 4A1.1 (the career offender guideline), not section 2D1.1 (the crack cocaine guideline). Thus, Amendment 706 did not lower the defendant's actual sentencing range. Consequently, the district court did not err in determining that it lacked the authority to modify the defendant's sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p>The defendant has a fallback position. He asseverates that he is eligible for a sentence reduction because the district court originally imposed a non-guideline sentence after granting his plea for a downward variance. With this in mind, he suggests that the underlying offense conduct drove his sentence, not merely the career offender guideline. To bolster this suggestion, he notes that the district court remarked at sentencing that the offense of conviction was \"basically [a] routine streetsweeper type\" drug offense. In the defendant's view, this remark indicates that the court was relying on the severity of the underlying crack cocaine crime to fix his sentence.</p>\n<p>This argument lacks force. For one thing, the defendant places more weight on the district court's remark than that remark can bear. As we explained on direct review and today reaffirm, the court's \"primary rationale for imposing a sentence below the guideline sentencing range\" was not the nature of the offense conduct but, rather, the defendant's \"medical condition, which [the court] characterized as `obviously a serious situation.'\" <i>Caraballo,</i> 447 F.3d at 27.</p>\n<p>Perhaps more importantly, even though the defendant received a non-guideline sentence, that had no effect on the sentencing range applicable in his case (i.e., the sentencing range contemplated by section 3582(c)). Under an advisory guidelines system, a variance is granted in the sentencing court's discretion <i>after</i> the court has established an appropriately calculated guideline sentencing range. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Martin,</i> 520 F.3d 87, 91 (1st Cir.2008); <i>United States v. Robinson,</i> 433 F.3d 31, 35 (1st Cir.2005). It is that sentencing range that must be lowered by an amendment in order to engage the gears of section 3582(c)(2).<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> We need go no further. Simply put, the defendant has failed to satisfy the threshold requirement of section 3582(c)(2): his sentence was not \"based on a sentencing range that was subsequently lowered\" by Amendment 706.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  This case was consolidated with <i>United States v. Ayala-Pizarro,</i> No. 08-1321, and argued in this court on November 5, 2008. Although the issue presented in both appeals is substantially identical, we opt to decide the cases separately. This is the first of the decisions; an opinion in <i>Ayala-Pizarro</i> will issue shortly. (551 F.3d 84).</p>\n<p>[2]  Technically speaking, Amendment 706 modifies the drug quantity table. Its effect, however, is to mitigate the recommended guideline sentencing ranges for offenses involving crack cocaine. For ease in exposition, we shall refer to the affected portion of the drug quantity table as \"the crack cocaine guideline.\"</p>\n<p>[3]  To some extent, the defendant's argument is a potential boomerang. The sentencing guidelines suggest that even when a defendant has established his eligibility for a sentence reduction under section 3582(c)(2), \"a further reduction would generally not be appropriate\" if the original sentence is a downwardly variant non-guideline sentence. USSG § 1B1.10(b)(2)(B).</p>\n<p>[4]  The failure to cross the statutory threshold obviates any need to address the scope of the district court's discretion to modify a sentence once that threshold requirement is satisfied. Thus, we take no view on the question of whether a defendant who satisfies the threshold requirement of section 3582(c)(2) is entitled to a full resentencing, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>United States, v. Hicks,</i> 472 F.3d 1167, 1173 (9th Cir.2007), or merely to a reduction that reflects a mechanical substitution of the amended guideline for the original guideline, <i>cf. </i><i>Jordan,</i> 162 F.3d at 5 (holding that a retroactive amendment that reduced the defendant's sentencing range did not authorize the district court to consider further reductions in the sentence predicated on an argument that was unavailable at the original sentencing).</p>\n\n</div>",

Leahy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202599\"><a href=\"/opinion/202599/united-states-v-leahy/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">401</span></a></span>, 405 (1st Cir.2007); <i>United States v. Gibbens,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195396\"><a href=\"/opinion/195396/united-states-v-gibbens/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span>, 32 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n<p>Finality is an important attribute of judgments and, typically, once a pronounced sentence in a criminal case becomes final and unappealable, it may not be modified. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Lawrence,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1323921\"><a href=\"/opinion/1323921/united-states-v-lawrence/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">631</span></a></span>, 637 (7th Cir. 2008); <i>United States v. Jordan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"759597\"><a href=\"/opinion/759597/united-states-v-barry-jordan/\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 2 (1st Cir.1998); <i>see also</i> 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c). But this general rule, like virtually every general rule, admits of exceptions. One such exception is embodied in the statute alluded to above, which provides in relevant part that:</p>\n<blockquote>in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission ... the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p>18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2). In enacting this statute, Congress spoke with unmistakable clarity: before a district court can consider a sentence modification thereunder, it must satisfy itself that the original sentence was \"<i>based on</i> a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p>In the case at hand, the defendant acknowledges that the lower court sentenced him as a career offender, and he eschews any challenge to that designation. He nonetheless maintains that his sentence was \"based on\" the crack cocaine guideline, USSG § 2D1.1, because the court used that guideline in the series of calculations leading up to its production of the sentencing range that it ultimately found applicable.</p>\n<p>Refined to bare essence, the defendant's suggestion is that, even though his sentence was not dictated exclusively by the crack cocaine guideline, it was \"based on\" that guideline because that guideline was a way station along the road that the district court traveled in arriving at the appropriate sentencing range. He insists that, given this imbrication, Amendment 706 unlocks section 3582(c)(2) and authorizes the district court, on his motion, to recalculate his sentencing range and determine anew, in light of generally applicable sentencing factors, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), whether a sentence reduction is warranted.</p>\n<p>We are not persuaded. Here, the district court first determined the offense level applicable to the underlying drug-trafficking offenses, using the crack cocaine guideline. It then determined the alternate offense level resulting from the defendant's status as a career offender. Only then did it choose the offense level that it actually used in sentencing the defendant: the enhanced career offender level.</p>\n<p>The defendant's argument that this oblique reference to the crack cocaine guideline was enough to trigger section 3582(c)(2) disregards the way in which the career offender guideline operates. As we explained in <i>United States v. Ventura,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784542\"><a href=\"/opinion/784542/united-states-v-rafael-ventura/\"><span class=\"volume\">353</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">84</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2003), the career offender guideline incorporates its own sentencing table. <i>Id.</i> at 90. If the offense level for a career offender <i>from that table</i> \"is greater than the offense level otherwise applicable, the offense level from the [career offender] <span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> table ... shall apply.\" USSG § 4B1.1(b). That usually will be the case, since the career offender guideline \"sets forth a tabulation of offense levels that are determined by reference to the statutory maximum sentences authorized for various offenses of conviction.\" <i>Ventura,</i> 353 F.3d at 90.</p>\n<p>Given this architecture, the sentencing court's authority is severely limited in career offender cases:</p>\n<blockquote>[T]he sentencing court <i>must</i> take the applicable offense level from the career offender table and compare it to the offense level that would be applicable absent a career offender designation. If the former exceeds the latter, the court <i>must</i> use it in determining the defendant's [guideline sentencing range].</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p>This case hewed to the normal pattern: the career offender guideline provided the higher offense level and, thus, yielded a more punitive sentencing range. That was the range that the district court actually used at sentencing. Consequently, to say that the defendant's sentence was \"based on\" the crack cocaine guideline strains credulity. Reaching that result would require us to rewrite section 3582(c)(2) and, in the bargain, invade Congress's exclusive preserve.</p>\n<p>Nor is there room for any legitimate doubt. In drafting section 3582(c)(2), Congress has not sounded an uncertain trumpet but, rather, has couched the statute in plain and unambiguous language. The term \"sentencing range\" clearly contemplates the end result of the overall guideline calculus, not the series of tentative results reached at various interim steps in the performance of that calculus. Thus, if an amended guideline does not have the effect of lowering the sentencing range actually used at sentencing, the defendant's sentence was not based on that range within the intendment of the statute.</p>\n<p>We add three embellishments. First, our \"plain meaning\" construction of section 3582(c)(2) comports with the authorities elsewhere. Three other courts of appeals have addressed this precise question, and each of them has read the statute in the same manner as do we. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Sharkey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"171287\"><a href=\"/opinion/171287/united-states-v-sharkey/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1236</span></a></span>, 1239 (10th Cir. 2008); <i>United States v. Moore,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"78144\"><a href=\"/opinion/78144/united-states-v-moore/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1323</span></a></span>, 1328 (11th Cir.2008); <i>United States v. Tingle,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1195501\"><a href=\"/opinion/1195501/united-states-v-tingle/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">839</span></a></span>, 840 (8th Cir.2008) (per curiam).</p>\n<p>Second, our construction of section 3582(c)(2) is entirely consistent with the Sentencing Commission's policy statements. <i>See, e.g.,</i> USSG § 1B1.10(a)(2)(B) (made effective on March 3, 2008, by Amendment 712) (explaining that a sentence reduction \"is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) if  an amendment ... does not have the effect of lowering the defendant's applicable guideline range\"). The defendant urges us to ignore this policy statement as merely advisory in a post-<i>Booker</i> world  but <i>Booker</i> neither undermined the continued vitality of section 3582(c)(2) nor altered the customary canons of statutory construction. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Wise,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1387484\"><a href=\"/opinion/1387484/united-states-v-wise/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">207</span></a></span>, 221 n. 11 (3d Cir.2008) (reasoning that nothing in <i>Booker</i> \"purported to obviate the congressional directive on whether a sentence could be reduced based on subsequent changes in the Guidelines\"). The plain language of the statute drives the result here.</p>\n<p>Third, our conclusion here is fortified by our decision in <i>United States v. Hickey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199837\"><a href=\"/opinion/199837/united-states-v-hickey/\"><span class=\"volume\">280</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2002). There, the defendant had been found guilty of both an armed robbery and a firearms offense. <i>Id.</i> at 66. Nevertheless, he was sentenced as a career offender. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>After sentence was imposed, the Sentencing Commission promulgated a clarifying <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> amendment mitigating the recommended punishment for this combination of underlying offenses. <i>See id.</i> at 66-67 (citing USSG App. C, Amend. 599 (2000)). Hickey sought a sentence reduction but we ruled that section 3582(c)(2) was unavailable because his sentence had been based on the career offender offense level and the resulting sentencing range, not the offense levels and sentencing ranges for the underlying offenses. <i>See id.</i> at 69.</p>\n<p><i>Hickey</i> stands for the proposition that a sentencing court has no authority to entertain a sentence reduction motion under section 3582(c)(2) when the guideline amendment in question does not affect the guideline sentencing range actually used by the sentencing court. <i>Id.</i> Our decision today tracks the <i>Hickey</i> court's reasoning and emulates its result.</p>\n<p>We succinctly summarize. Had the new guideline provision for crack cocaine offenses (Amendment 706) been in effect when this defendant was sentenced, that provision would not have had any effect on the sentencing range actually used. As we have said, the defendant's actual sentencing range was produced by reference to section 4A1.1 (the career offender guideline), not section 2D1.1 (the crack cocaine guideline). Thus, Amendment 706 did not lower the defendant's actual sentencing range. Consequently, the district court did not err in determining that it lacked the authority to modify the defendant's sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p>The defendant has a fallback position. He asseverates that he is eligible for a sentence reduction because the district court originally imposed a non-guideline sentence after granting his plea for a downward variance. With this in mind, he suggests that the underlying offense conduct drove his sentence, not merely the career offender guideline. To bolster this suggestion, he notes that the district court remarked at sentencing that the offense of conviction was \"basically [a] routine streetsweeper type\" drug offense. In the defendant's view, this remark indicates that the court was relying on the severity of the underlying crack cocaine crime to fix his sentence.</p>\n<p>This argument lacks force. For one thing, the defendant places more weight on the district court's remark than that remark can bear. As we explained on direct review and today reaffirm, the court's \"primary rationale for imposing a sentence below the guideline sentencing range\" was not the nature of the offense conduct but, rather, the defendant's \"medical condition, which [the court] characterized as `obviously a serious situation.'\" <i>Caraballo,</i> 447 F.3d at 27.</p>\n<p>Perhaps more importantly, even though the defendant received a non-guideline sentence, that had no effect on the sentencing range applicable in his case (i.e., the sentencing range contemplated by section 3582(c)). Under an advisory guidelines system, a variance is granted in the sentencing court's discretion <i>after</i> the court has established an appropriately calculated guideline sentencing range. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Martin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203196\"><a href=\"/opinion/203196/united-states-v-martin/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></a></span>, 91 (1st Cir.2008); <i>United States v. Robinson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201981\"><a href=\"/opinion/201981/united-states-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span>, 35 (1st Cir.2005). It is that sentencing range that must be lowered by an amendment in order to engage the gears of section 3582(c)(2).<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> We need go no further. Simply put, the defendant has failed to satisfy the threshold requirement of section 3582(c)(2): his sentence was not \"based on a sentencing range that was subsequently lowered\" by Amendment 706.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  This case was consolidated with <i>United States v. Ayala-Pizarro,</i> No. 08-1321, and argued in this court on November 5, 2008. Although the issue presented in both appeals is substantially identical, we opt to decide the cases separately. This is the first of the decisions; an opinion in <i>Ayala-Pizarro</i> will issue shortly. (551 F.3d 84).</p>\n<p>[2]  Technically speaking, Amendment 706 modifies the drug quantity table. Its effect, however, is to mitigate the recommended guideline sentencing ranges for offenses involving crack cocaine. For ease in exposition, we shall refer to the affected portion of the drug quantity table as \"the crack cocaine guideline.\"</p>\n<p>[3]  To some extent, the defendant's argument is a potential boomerang. The sentencing guidelines suggest that even when a defendant has established his eligibility for a sentence reduction under section 3582(c)(2), \"a further reduction would generally not be appropriate\" if the original sentence is a downwardly variant non-guideline sentence. USSG § 1B1.10(b)(2)(B).</p>\n<p>[4]  The failure to cross the statutory threshold obviates any need to address the scope of the district court's discretion to modify a sentence once that threshold requirement is satisfied. Thus, we take no view on the question of whether a defendant who satisfies the threshold requirement of section 3582(c)(2) is entitled to a full resentencing, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>United States, v. Hicks,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796414\"><a href=\"/opinion/796414/united-states-v-aaron-hicks/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1167</span></a></span>, 1173 (9th Cir.2007), or merely to a reduction that reflects a mechanical substitution of the amended guideline for the original guideline, <i>cf. </i><i>Jordan,</i> 162 F.3d at 5 (holding that a retroactive amendment that reduced the defendant's sentencing range did not authorize the district court to consider further reductions in the sentence predicated on an argument that was unavailable at the original sentencing).</p>\n\n</div>",
