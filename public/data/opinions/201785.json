This      case   raises       important\n\nquestions about the ability of bankruptcy courts to subordinate\n\nclaims arising from stock redemption installment payments that\n\ntrace their origin to ERISA-qualified retirement plans.                           After\n\nreviewing recent Supreme Court precedents, we hold, as a general\n\nmatter,   that    bankruptcy         courts    may   not    use   their    powers     of\n\nequitable subordination to downgrade stock redemption claims on a\n\ncategorical basis; instead, they must evaluate the propriety of\n\nequitable   subordination        case     by    case.       Taking     this     general\n\napproach, we hold, more specifically, that the stock redemption\n\nnote at issue here — a note delivered in partial liquidation of the\n\nretirement benefits of a retiring employee under an employee stock\n\nownership plan — may not be equitably subordinated because the\n\ndebtor    has    not   made      a    particularized         showing      of    special\n\ncircumstances (such as misconduct on the part of the note holder).\n\nConsequently, we reverse the contrary rulings of the courts below,\n\nvacate the order appealed from, and remand for further proceedings\n\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n            The material facts are not in dispute.                        The debtor,\n\nMerrimac Paper Company, Inc., is a Delaware corporation that\n\nmaintains its principal place of business in Massachusetts.                          The\n\nappellant, Ralph Harrison, worked for the debtor in an executive\n\ncapacity from 1963 to 1999.             When the debtor adopted an employee\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fstock   ownership    plan   (ESOP)   in    1985,     the    appellant   became   a\n\nparticipant.\n\n           The ESOP was qualified under the Employee Retirement\n\nIncome Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).           See 29 U.S.C. § 1107(d)(6);\n\nsee also 26 U.S.C. § 4975(e)(7).          Pursuant to its terms, the debtor\n\nestablished     a   trust   and   proceeded     to     make    variable   annual\n\ncontributions to it (in amounts designated from time to time by its\n\nboard of directors).        The trust invested the funds on behalf of\n\nparticipating employees, primarily in the debtor's stock.                    The\n\ntrust   maintained    an    individual     account    for     each   participant,\n\nspecifying his or her share of the investments held in trust.               Over\n\ntime, the ESOP (and through it, the debtor's employees as a class)\n\ncame to own the majority of the debtor's issued and outstanding\n\ncommon stock.\n\n           The ESOP provided that upon a participating employee's\n\nseparation from service, the vested portion of that employee's\n\nindividual account would be distributed to him or her in the form\n\nof the debtor's stock.       Because the stock was not publicly traded,\n\na retiring employee had the option either to retain the stock\n\nreceived or, at any time within fifteen months of the distribution\n\ndate, to compel the debtor to redeem it at fair market value (a\n\nstep known as the \"put option\").           Upon an employee's exercise of\n\nthe put option, the debtor could elect to pay for the redeemed\n\nstock in substantially equal annual payments over a period not to\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fexceed five years.      If the debtor chose to make installment\n\npayments, it was required to pay interest on the deferred balance\n\nand to furnish adequate security.1\n\n           At the time of the appellant's retirement in 1999, his\n\nESOP account held approximately 6% of the debtor's common stock.\n\nHe indicated an intention to exercise the put option. Following an\n\nappraisal, the appellant's shares were valued at $1,116,200.\n\n           On July 19, 2000, the appellant formally exercised the\n\nput   option.   In   simultaneous    transactions,   he   constructively\n\nreceived the shares and sold them back to the debtor, which gave\n\nhim a promissory note for $916,300 (the Note). This amount equaled\n\nthe appraised value of the shares less a cash advance paid earlier\n\nto the appellant.     The Note bore interest at a rate of 8.5% per\n\nannum and called for the principal balance to be amortized in three\n\nequal annual installments.\n\n           The appellant received the first installment payment on\n\nJanuary 4, 2001.      The debtor thereafter encountered financial\n\ndifficulties and failed to make the next annual payment.              On\n\nSeptember 6, 2002, the appellant accelerated the Note and brought\n\nsuit in a Massachusetts state court for breach of contract based on\n\nthe failure to pay.    A few days later, the appellant attached the\n\n\n\n      1\n      The ESOP's stock redemption provisions conformed precisely to\nthe applicable federal statutes and regulations. See 29 U.S.C. §\n1107(d)(6)(A); see also 26 U.S.C. §§ 401(a)(23), 409(h); 26 C.F.R.\n§ 54.4975-7(b)(12)(iv).\n\n                                    -5-\n\fdebtor's real estate (the Attachment) to secure payment of the\n\nbalance owed on the Note.\n\n            The appellant's state court complaint did not mention\n\nERISA.     He remedied this omission in January of 2003, when he\n\ninstituted a second suit in the federal district court.                      His\n\nfederal court complaint named the debtor, the ESOP, and the ESOP's\n\ntrustees    as    defendants    and   averred,   inter     alia,     that   these\n\ndefendants had denied him ERISA benefits (specifically, the unpaid\n\nbalance due on the Note) and, in the bargain, had failed to fulfill\n\ntheir fiduciary duties under ERISA.              The debtor countered by\n\nremoving the state court action to the federal court on the ground\n\nthat it constituted part and parcel of the same case or controversy\n\nas the newly filed federal action.          See 28 U.S.C. §§ 1367, 1441.\n\n            Two    months    later,   the   debtor     filed   for   bankruptcy\n\nprotection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.              See 11 U.S.C.\n\n§§   1101-1174.        The     docketing    of   the    bankruptcy     petition\n\nautomatically stayed the appellant's two pending actions.               See id.\n\n§ 362(a)(1).      The appellant filed a timely claim in the bankruptcy\n\nproceedings and noted on the claim form that he sought \"ERISA\n\nbenefits.\"       He attached to the claim copies of both the Note and\n\nthe state court complaint.\n\n            On June 20, 2003, the debtor commenced an adversary\n\nproceeding against the appellant in an effort to subordinate his\n\nclaim.   See 11 U.S.C. § 510(b), (c)(1).         It also sought to have the\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fAttachment transferred to the bankruptcy estate for the benefit of\n\ncreditors generally.        See id. § 510(c)(2).          The debtor's ensuing\n\nmotion for summary judgment characterized the appellant's claim as\n\na \"stock redemption claim\" but did specify that it had its genesis\n\nin an ESOP retirement distribution.              While its summary judgment\n\nmotion    was    pending,   the    debtor     filed   its   proposed    plan   of\n\nreorganization.      That plan contemplated that the claims of general\n\nunsecured creditors would have priority over stock redemption\n\nclaims (whether secured or unsecured), regardless of their origin.\n\nAs the debtor could only pay a fraction of the value of the general\n\nunsecured claims, this meant that the Note would be extinguished\n\nand the appellant would receive nothing on it.\n\n            The appellant opposed both the summary judgment motion\n\nand the reorganization plan, arguing among other things that\n\npayment of ERISA-protected employee benefits pursuant to an ESOP is\n\nqualitatively different than a garden-variety stock redemption and\n\nthat, even if the court treated his claim as a stock redemption\n\nclaim     notwithstanding        its   ERISA-connected      roots,     equitable\n\nsubordination was not available in the absence of any inequitable\n\nconduct     on     his   part.         The    appellant     also   launched     a\n\ncounteroffensive; he asked the district court to withdraw the\n\nadversary        proceeding,     challenging      the     bankruptcy     court's\n\njurisdiction on the ground that the adversary proceeding required\n\nthe resolution of ERISA issues.              See 28 U.S.C. § 157(d) (stating\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fthat a district court shall withdraw such a proceeding if it\n\nrequires consideration of both bankruptcy law and other federal\n\nlaw).    Concomitantly, the appellant asked the bankruptcy court to\n\nlift the automatic stay insofar as it pertained to his pending\n\nactions.\n\n            This counteroffensive bore no fruit.     The district court\n\ndenied the motion to withdraw the adversary proceeding on July 8,\n\n2003, holding that the proceeding did not involve a substantial\n\nquestion   of   ERISA   law.   The   bankruptcy   court   denied   without\n\nprejudice the appellant's motion to lift the automatic stay.          The\n\ncourt explained that, in its view, \"many if not all of the issues\"\n\npresented in the original litigation would be rendered moot by its\n\nresolution of the matters pending in the bankruptcy court.\n\n            On November 7, 2003, the bankruptcy court granted the\n\ndebtor's summary judgment motion and subordinated the appellant's\n\nclaim.    In re Merrimac Paper Co., 303 B.R. 710, 722-23 (Bankr. D.\n\nMass. 2003) (Merrimac I).      The court considered the appellant to\n\nhave made two claims, namely, a straightforward claim for payment\n\nof the Note and an ERISA claim unrelated to the Note.         See id. at\n\n718.    With respect to the latter claim, the court remarked that it\n\nhad looked to the complaint in the original federal court action\n\nand considered the claim to be for \"damages that arise from [the\n\nappellant's] sale of stock to Merrimac.\"      Id. at 719.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\f          In evaluating these claims, the bankruptcy court first\n\nconsidered section 510(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, which requires\n\nsubordination of any and all claims arising from \"rescission of a\n\npurchase or sale of a security of the debtor.\"       The court found\n\nthat the claim under the Note arose from the enforcement of a debt,\n\nnot the sale of a security.   Id. at 718-19.   Accordingly, the claim\n\ncould not be subordinated under section 510(b).         Id. at 719.\n\nConversely, the court characterized what it described as the\n\n\"unrelated\" ERISA claim as one arising out of the sale of stock\n\nand, thus, found it to be within the purview of section 510(b).\n\nId. at 719-20.   Consequently, that claim was subordinated.    Id. at\n\n720.\n\n          The court then turned to the question of equitable\n\nsubordination.   See 11 U.S.C. § 510(c) (authorizing a bankruptcy\n\ncourt to subordinate any and all claims for equitable reasons).\n\nThe court ruled that, under traditional principles of equitable\n\nsubordination, all claims based on stock redemption notes must be\n\nsubordinated.    Id. at 720-22.   Hence, insofar as the appellant's\n\nclaim was based on the Note, it had to be equitably subordinated.\n\nId. at 722.   Consistent with these holdings, the court transferred\n\nthe appellant's interest in the Attachment to the bankruptcy\n\n\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\festate, see 11 U.S.C. § 510(c)(2), and confirmed the debtor's plan\n\nof reorganization.2\n\n            The appellant unsuccessfully appealed the subordination\n\norder to the district court.     See In re Merrimac Paper Co., 317\n\nB.R. 215, 223 (D. Mass. 2004) (Merrimac II); see also 28 U.S.C. §\n\n158(c).    This timely appeal followed.3\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n            Although we serve as a second tier of appellate review,\n\nwe \"cede no special deference to the district court's initial\n\nreview.\"    In re Bank of New Engl. Corp., 364 F.3d 355, 361 (1st\n\nCir. 2004).      Rather, we review directly the bankruptcy court's\n\ndetermination, scrutinizing its findings of fact for clear error\n\nand its conclusions of law de novo.        In re Carp, 340 F.3d 15, 21\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).      The application of the Bankruptcy Code to the\n\nfacts as found (or, as here, to undisputed facts) presents a mixed\n\nquestion of law and fact, reviewable for clear error \"unless the\n\nbankruptcy court's analysis was based on a mistaken view of the\n\nlegal principles involved.\"    Id. at 22; see also In re Indep. Eng'g\n\nCo., 197 F.3d 13, 16 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n\n      2\n      The plan of reorganization provides that if the appellant\nsuccessfully appeals the subordination ruling(s), he will have a\nsecured claim (subject to further challenge) to the extent of the\nAttachment and an unsecured claim for the balance. Funds have been\nescrowed to assure the implementation of this arrangement. See\nMerrimac I, 303 B.R. at 712 & n.2.\n      3\n      We acknowledge with appreciation the helpful amicus brief and\noral argument proffered by the United States Department of Labor.\n\n                                 -10-\n\f           The threshold question here involves the precise nature\n\nof the claims that are subject to review.                The debtor argues that\n\nwe   should     review    only     the    propriety      vel    non    of   equitable\n\nsubordination of the Note claim, as any ERISA claim distinct from\n\nthe Note claim was never properly pleaded (or, if properly pleaded,\n\nwas waived).     The appellant disputes this characterization of the\n\nrecord,   but     insists       that,    in    all    events,    such    issues    are\n\nsuperfluous.      He submits that were we to reverse the bankruptcy\n\ncourt's ukase equitably subordinating the Note claim, he will\n\nobtain complete relief whether or not his ERISA claim was properly\n\npleaded or punctiliously preserved.\n\n           We agree with the appellant.                And because we hold that\n\nequitable subordination of the Note claim was unwarranted here, see\n\ntext infra, we need not decide independently the propriety of the\n\nbankruptcy      court's       subordination      of    what    it   viewed   as    the\n\nappellant's separate ERISA claim under section 510(b).\n\n                         A.    Equitable Subordination.\n\n           Section       510(c)    of    the    Bankruptcy      Code    provides    in\n\npertinent part that a bankruptcy court may, \"under principles of\n\nequitable subordination, subordinate for purposes of distribution\n\nall or part of an allowed claim to all or part of another allowed\n\nclaim.\"   11 U.S.C. § 510(c)(1).              The Code does not elaborate upon\n\nthe nature of these principles, but the Supreme Court has made\n\nclear that in administering this section, the starting point should\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\fbe   the    compendium        of    judge-made      principles    of    equitable\n\nsubordination that existed prior to 1978 (when Congress enacted the\n\nBankruptcy Code).        See United States v. Noland, 517 U.S. 535, 539\n\n(1996).    This is not to say that section 510(c) froze pre-1978 law\n\nin place.    The federal courts have latitude to tweak preexisting\n\nequitable principles and to develop new ones.                 See id. at 540.\n\n            The   contours         of   equitable       subordination   are   well\n\ndelineated in a Fifth Circuit opinion, In re Mobile Steel Co., 563\n\nF.2d 692 (5th Cir. 1977) (an opinion that the Noland Court deemed\n\n\"influential,\" 517 U.S. at 538).                First, equitable subordination\n\ndemands that the claimant be found to have engaged in inequitable\n\nconduct.    Mobile Steel, 563 F.2d at 700.                Second, the misconduct\n\nmust have either resulted in injury to creditors or given the\n\nclaimant an unfair advantage.           Id.     Third, equitable subordination\n\nof the claim must not be in conflict with the provisions of federal\n\nbankruptcy law.         Id.   This court has adopted Mobile Steel as the\n\ngold standard for section 510(c) cases.                  See In re 604 Columbus\n\nAve. Realty Trust, 968 F.2d 1332, 1353 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n            In    the     case     at   hand,     the    debtor   questions     the\n\napplicability of the Mobile Steel criteria.                It points to an older\n\nbody of precedent in this circuit holding that stock redemption\n\nclaims, as a class, are subject to equitable subordination without\n\nany showing of inequitable conduct on the claimant's part.                    See\n\nMatthews Bros. v. Pullen, 268 F. 827 (1st Cir. 1920); Keith v.\n\n\n                                         -12-\n\fKilmer (In re Nat'l Piano Co.), 261 F. 733 (1st Cir. 1919).                         This\n\nline     of     authority         derives    from     the    general   precept      that\n\nstockholders may not receive any of the assets of an insolvent\n\ncorporation until the corporation's creditors are paid in full.\n\nSee, e.g., In re Geneva Steel Co., 281 F.3d 1173, 1181 n.4 (10th\n\nCir.   2002)         (\"Under      [the   absolute     priority    rule],     unsecured\n\ncreditors stand ahead of investors in the receiving line and their\n\nclaims        must    be    satisfied        before    any     investment    loss    is\n\ncompensated.\").             The    driving    force    behind    decisions    such    as\n\nMatthews Bros. and Keith is the desire to prevent stockholders from\n\nsubverting this precept by structuring hastily engineered stock\n\nredemption agreements as a means of substituting debt for equity\n\n(and, thus, sharing company assets ratably with creditors).                          See\n\nKeith, 261 F. at 734 (holding that \"a stockholder, contracting with\n\nthe corporation . . . for the benefit of himself,\" may not \"through\n\nan executory contract, cease to be a stockholder, and become a\n\ncreditor, to share in competition with other creditors in the\n\nassets of the corporation when bankrupt\"); see also Matthews Bros.,\n\n268 F. at 828 (clarifying that Keith applies even though the\n\nparties acted in good faith and the corporation was solvent when\n\nthe stock redemption agreement was executed).\n\n               Keith       and    Matthews    Bros.     long    predated     both    the\n\nBankruptcy Code and the enactment of ERISA.                     Nevertheless, lower\n\ncourts have taken the position that such categorical \"no-fault\"\n\n\n                                             -13-\n\fsubordination remains appropriate under section 510(c) with respect\n\nto claims emanating from stock redemption agreements.   See, e.g.,\n\nIn re Main St. Brewing Co., 210 B.R. 662, 665-66 (Bankr. D. Mass.\n\n1997); In re New Era Packaging, Inc., 186 B.R. 329, 335-36 (Bankr.\n\nD. Mass. 1995); In re SPM Mfg. Corp., 163 B.R. 411, 416 (Bankr. D.\n\nMass. 1994).   The primary support for the continued application of\n\nthese hoary precedents comes from statements made during floor\n\ndebates incident to passage of the 1978 bankruptcy bill, whose\n\nsponsors noted, in joint statements, that existing case law would\n\nhelp to establish the principles of equitable subordination.    See\n\n124 Cong. Rec. 32398 (1978) (statement of Rep. Edwards), reprinted\n\nin 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6436, 6452; 124 Cong. Rec. 33998 (1978)\n\n(statement of Sen. DeConcini), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6505,\n\n6521; see also SPM Mfg., 163 B.R. at 414 (quoting joint floor\n\nstatement for proposition that, \"under existing case law, a claim\n\nis generally subordinated . . . [if] the claim itself is of a\n\nstatus susceptible to subordination, such as a penalty\").      Those\n\ncourts believed that stock redemption claims, like penalties, were\n\nsusceptible of subordination based on their essential nature.    So\n\ntoo the bankruptcy court in the instant case, which accepted this\n\nreasoning in subordinating the appellant's claim.   Merrimac I, 303\n\nB.R. at 720-23.\n\n          The district court was more cautious. It recognized that\n\nwe had not reaffirmed our turn-of-the-century precedents since the\n\n\n                                -14-\n\fpassage of section 510(c), but ultimately concluded that the\n\ncategorical   rule    of    Keith     and   Matthews     Bros.   would     survive.\n\nMerrimac II, 317 B.R. at 221.          The court based this conclusion on\n\nour 1986 affirmance, without opinion, in Liebowitz v. Columbia\n\nPacking Co., 56 B.R. 222 (D. Mass. 1985), aff'd, 802 F.2d 439 (1st\n\nCir. 1986) (table).        See Merrimac II, 317 B.R. at 221.\n\n          Liebowitz, however, is a very slender reed.                Our opinion\n\nis unpublished and unpublished opinions have no precedential force.\n\nSee United States v. Meade, 110 F.3d 190, 202 n.23 (1st Cir. 1997);\n\nsee also 1st Cir. R. 32.3(a)(2). Thus, our affirmance in Liebowitz\n\nis of no consequence.        More importantly, two Supreme Court cases\n\ndecided subsequent to Liebowitz dispel any notion that a bankruptcy\n\ncourt must categorically impose equitable subordination merely\n\nbecause a claim arises out of a note taken in connection with a\n\nredemption of corporate stock.\n\n          The first of these cases is Noland.              There, the Internal\n\nRevenue   Service     (IRS)    filed        a   post-petition      claim    for     a\n\nnoncompensatory      tax    penalty    against     a    bankrupt    corporation.\n\nNoland, 517 U.S. at 536.       Such a claim ordinarily would be entitled\n\nto first priority in bankruptcy as an administrative expense.                     See\n\n11 U.S.C. §§ 503(b)(1)(C), 507(a)(1).                  Although the bankruptcy\n\ncourt found no misconduct on the part of the IRS, it ordered the\n\npenalty claim equitably subordinated under section 510(c) to avoid\n\nthe perceived unfairness of allowing the IRS to take precedence\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\fover secured and unsecured creditors who had given value to the\n\nbusiness.     The Sixth Circuit affirmed, looking to the legislative\n\nhistory of the Bankruptcy Code and holding that a tax penalty claim\n\ncould be subordinated, even in the absence of inequitable conduct\n\non the claimant's part.       In re First Truck Lines, Inc., 48 F.3d\n\n210, 214-18 (6th Cir. 1995).\n\n              The Supreme Court reversed.        It made clear that the\n\nmatter   of    equitable   subordination   had   to   be   approached   at   a\n\njudicial rather than legislative level.          Noland, 517 U.S. at 543.\n\nThus,    section   510(c)'s   reference    to   \"principles   of   equitable\n\nsubordination\" would permit a court sitting in equity to \"make\n\nexceptions to a general rule when justified by particular facts.\"\n\nId. at 540.        Such case-by-case adjudication is at the core of\n\njudicial competence.\n\n              The Court made equally clear, however, that courts were\n\nnot authorized to subordinate entire classes of claims based \"not\n\non individual equities but on the supposedly general unfairness\" of\n\npreferring that class of claims over another.         Id. at 540-41.    Such\n\ncategorical judgments are legislative in nature; they \"are not\n\ndictated or illuminated by principles of equity and do not fall\n\nwithin the judicial power of equitable subordination.\"             Id. at 541\n\n(quoting In re Burden, 917 F.2d 115, 122 (3d Cir. 1990) (Alito, J.,\n\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part)).          The Court emphasized\n\nthat \"Congress could have, but did not, deny . . . tax penalties\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\fthe first priority given to other administrative expenses,\" and\n\nruled that \"bankruptcy courts may not take it upon themselves to\n\nmake that categorical determination under the guise of equitable\n\nsubordination.\"       Id. at 543.\n\n            In    delineating     the    scope   of   the   bankruptcy    court's\n\nauthority to subordinate claims under section 510(c), the Noland\n\nCourt specifically rejected any contrary intimations found in the\n\nlegislative       history.      In    language   that   leaves   no     room       for\n\ninterpretation,       the     Court     specifically    stated    that,       as    a\n\nfundamental matter, the legislative history of section 510(c)\n\n\"cannot     be    read   to    convert    statutory     leeway   for     judicial\n\ndevelopment of a rule on particularized exceptions into delegated\n\nauthority    to    revise     statutory    categorization.\"       Id.    at    542.\n\nFinally, despite its earlier endorsement of Mobile Steel as the\n\nbenchmark of equitable subordination, the Court expressly declined\n\nto rule that equitable subordination was unavailable merely because\n\nthe IRS was not guilty of misconduct.            See id. at 543 (leaving open\n\nthe question of whether \"a bankruptcy court must always find\n\ncreditor misconduct before a claim may be equitably subordinated\".\n\n            In the same year, the Court decided United States v.\n\nReorganized CF & I Fabricators of Utah, Inc., 518 U.S. 213 (1996).\n\nThere, the IRS had filed a proof of claim under 26 U.S.C. §\n\n4971(a), a statute that imposed a 10% tax on the \"accumulated\n\nfunding deficiency\" of certain corporate pension plans.                   Id. at\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\f216.    The IRS sought to classify its claim as one for excise taxes\n\nin order to receive priority under what is now 11 U.S.C. §\n\n507(a)(8)(E).      The bankruptcy court held that the claim did not\n\nqualify as such.          Reorganized CF & I, 518 U.S. at 216-17.                  The\n\nclaim     was    thus     classified   as     an    unsecured       claim     in   the\n\ncorporation's Chapter 11 reorganization plan, but the bankruptcy\n\ncourt   nevertheless       subordinated     it     to    the    claims   of   general\n\nunsecured creditors based on its status as a penalty.                    Id. at 227.\n\n            The Supreme Court again reversed.                  The Court noted that\n\nthe case was different than Noland in that \"Noland passed on the\n\nsubordination from a higher priority class to the residual category\n\n. . . whereas here the subordination was imposed upon a disfavored\n\nsubgroup within the residual category.\"                 Id. at 229.      Still, the\n\nCourt   read     Noland    as   standing    for    the    proposition       that   the\n\n\"categorical reordering of priorities that takes place at the\n\nlegislative level of consideration is beyond the scope of judicial\n\nauthority\" with respect to equitable subordination under section\n\n510(c).    Id.\n\n            These two cases make it transparently clear that the\n\nbankruptcy court erred in subordinating both the secured and\n\nunsecured portions of the appellant's claim.                   The appellant has a\n\nnon-priority claim based on the Note, but — just as in CF & I — the\n\nbankruptcy court's decision to subordinate the claim was not\n\n\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\fpremised on the specific facts of the case but, rather, on the\n\ntaxonomic status of the claim.          See Merrimac I, 303 B.R. at 722.\n\n            The    debtor   attempts     to     resist   this    conclusion   by\n\ncontending that stock redemption claims, as a class, are subject to\n\nno-fault equitable subordination under Keith and Matthews Bros. It\n\ncites SPM Manufacturing as a \"leading\" bankruptcy court decision\n\nholding that this rule survives the passage of the Bankruptcy Code.\n\nWe reject this contention, as it fails to take into account the\n\nNoland Court's unambiguous repudiation of the legislative history\n\nupon which the SPM Manufacturing court relied.4\n\n            To be sure, the debtor tries to distinguish Noland on the\n\nground that \"it focuses exclusively on whether a bankruptcy court\n\ncan   categorically      subordinate     .    .   .    claims   that   Congress\n\nspecifically chose to treat as priority claims.\" Appellee's Br. at\n\n20.   In its view, Noland \"does not take away a bankruptcy court's\n\nability to [equitably] subordinate . . . types of claims to which\n\nCongress has not assigned a specific priority.\" Id. Conspicuously\n\nabsent    from    this   line   of   argument     is   any   acknowledgment   of\n\nReorganized CF & I, which clearly and directly rejected the very\n\ndistinction that the debtor now strives to draw.                See Reorganized\n\nCF & I, 518 U.S. at 229.        Taken together, the principles enunciated\n\n\n\n      4\n      The debtor's reliance on other pre-Noland cases is equally\nmisplaced. Indeed, one of those cases, In re Burden, 917 F.2d 115\n(3d Cir. 1990), was specifically rejected in Noland. See 517 U.S.\nat 538-40.\n\n                                      -19-\n\fin Noland and Reorganized CF & I vividly demonstrate why the\n\nbankruptcy court erred in equitably subordinating the appellant's\n\nclaim based on nothing more than its classification as a stock\n\nredemption claim.\n\n            We do not lightly discard our prior precedents.               Stare\n\ndecisis must yield, however, when a \"preexisting panel opinion is\n\nundermined by subsequently announced controlling authority, such as\n\na decision of the Supreme Court.\"           Eulitt v. Me., Dep't of Educ.,\n\n386 F.3d 344, 349 (1st Cir. 2004).          Here, the decisions in Noland\n\nand Reorganized CF & I, read together, constitute such supervening\n\nauthority. We therefore abrogate the categorical rule of Keith and\n\nMatthews Bros. and hold that claims founded on stock redemption\n\nnotes are not to be automatically subordinated solely on the basis\n\nof their intrinsic nature.\n\n            We do not, however, entirely reject the reasoning of\n\nKeith and Matthews Bros.        Indeed, we believe the core principle of\n\nthese    decisions   —   that    equity     holders   should   not   be   able\n\nartificially to evade the debt-over-equity paradigm — is generally\n\nsound.    But what Noland and Reorganized CF&I tell us is that even\n\nif claims arising out of stock redemption notes generally should be\n\nregarded as suspect, and thus subject to subordination, a court\n\nsitting in equity must nonetheless consider whether subordinating\n\na particular claim would be fair based on the totality of the\n\ncircumstances in the individual case.          Cf. Noland, 517 U.S. at 540\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\f(holding that although penalty claims cannot be categorically\n\nsubordinated, they may be subordinated on a case-by-case basis).\n\n          We add a coda.     Our prior cases adopting the first prong\n\nof Mobile Steel, see, e.g., 604 Columbus Ave. Realty Trust, 968\n\nF.2d at 1353, did not deal with the type of situations described in\n\nKeith and Matthews Bros..          This fact, combined with the Noland\n\nCourt's specific reservation of the question, 517 U.S. at 543,\n\nleaves   it   far   from   clear    whether   the   inequitable   conduct\n\nrequirement would apply in such circumstances.         As we have said,\n\nhowever, that is a question for another day.\n\n                           B.   The Equities.\n\n          Our holding that stock redemption claims, as a class, may\n\nnot automatically be subjected to equitable subordination does not\n\nend our odyssey.     We therefore turn to the case-specific inquiry\n\nthat the bankruptcy court failed to undertake:        do the equities of\n\nthis case support the equitable subordination of the appellant's\n\nstock redemption note claim?          In undertaking this assessment, we\n\nbegin with an explanation of the statutory mechanism underpinning\n\nthe creation and use of ESOPs.        An ESOP is an oddity among ERISA\n\nplans.   It serves three discrete purposes:          it functions as an\n\nemployee retirement benefit plan, as a device for increasing a\n\ncorporation's capitalization, and as a method of fostering loyalty.\n\nSee Lalonde v. Textron, Inc., 369 F.3d 1, 4 n.7 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that its focus is on investing exclusively\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\fin company stock, an ESOP is considered a \"stock bonus plan\" and,\n\nas such, must meet various regulatory benchmarks prescribed by\n\nCongress and by the Secretary of the Treasury.                    29 U.S.C. §\n\n1107(d)(6)(A).     The benchmarks include a mandate that an ESOP must\n\nsatisfy the cash distribution requirement of section 409(h) of the\n\nInternal Revenue Code.          See 26 U.S.C. § 401(a)(23).       That section\n\nprovides that beneficiaries of such a plan may demand their share\n\nof employer securities upon retirement, id. § 409(h)(1)(A), and \"if\n\nthe employer securities are not readily tradable on an established\n\nmarket,\"   a    retiring    employee      may   \"require   that   the    employer\n\nrepurchase     [the]   employer     securities     under   a   fair     valuation\n\nformula,\" id. § 409(h)(1)(B).\n\n           This latter choice is the put option, and its exercise is\n\nlimited to a relatively brief interval following separation from\n\nservice (by retirement or otherwise).             See id. § 409(h)(4).       When\n\nan employer is subject to the put option (i.e., when, and only\n\nwhen, its stock is not readily tradable), the employer may elect to\n\npay the repurchase price over a period not to exceed five years.\n\nId. § 409(h)(5)(A).        Once that election is made, the employer must\n\npost adequate security.          Id. § 409(h)(5)(B).\n\n           Having limned the origins of the Note, we look next to\n\nthe equities of subordinating the appellant's claim.              Any case-by-\n\ncase analysis of the equities of subordinating a particular claim\n\nthat   arises    out   of   a    stock    redemption   must    begin     with   an\n\n\n                                         -22-\n\fexamination of whether the underlying rationale for the Keith rule\n\napplies.      In a pre-Noland case, the Seventh Circuit described that\n\nrationale as follows:\n\n              [Stock redemption] claims are, in substance,\n              based on equity interests. When [the holders\n              of   those    claims]    invested   in    [the\n              corporation], they positioned themselves to\n              benefit if the company performed well, but\n              they also accepted the risk that the company\n              might perform poorly.    Thus [they] accepted\n              risks and benefits that . . . unsecured\n              creditors did not, and as such their equity\n              interests were legally subordinate to possible\n              claims of unsecured creditors.\n\nMatter of Envirodyne Indus., Inc., 79 F.3d 579, 583 (7th Cir.\n\n1996).      This rationale does not apply to the appellant's claim for\n\nseveral reasons.\n\n              First, the stock redemption transaction in this case\n\noccurred within the ERISA framework.                That matters because a\n\nparticipant in an ERISA plan does not assume the same levels of\n\nrisk   as    a    typical   equity    investor.     Indeed,    one   of   ERISA's\n\nprincipal        purposes   is   to   minimize    risks   to   a   participant's\n\nretirement benefits.         See 29 U.S.C. § 1001(b); see also Nachman\n\nCorp. v. Pension Benefit Guar. Corp., 446 U.S. 359, 375 (1980)\n\n(stating that ERISA seeks to ensure that \"if a worker has been\n\npromised a defined pension benefit upon retirement — and if he has\n\nfulfilled whatever conditions are required to obtain a vested\n\nbenefit — he will actually receive it\").                  Thus, although the\n\nemployee's position entails market risk during the period of\n\n\n                                        -23-\n\femployment (the ESOP holds the stock in trust for its participants,\n\nand so the employee is, functionally, a stockholder), ERISA seeks\n\nto eliminate that risk once retirement occurs.                       The ordinary\n\nrepurchase by a company of its stock carries with it the implied\n\ncondition     that     payment   is   contingent    on   the    fulfillment        of\n\nobligations to other creditors. Cf. Robinson v. Wangemann, 75 F.2d\n\n756, 757-58 (5th Cir. 1935) (implying the existence of such a\n\ncondition).      The mandates of ERISA, however — particularly its\n\nrequirement that the holders of ESOP-spawned stock redemption notes\n\nbe   given    adequate    security    —   argue    persuasively       against     the\n\nimplication of any such condition where an ERISA-qualified ESOP is\n\ninvolved.\n\n              We add, moreover, that this Note is not (and should not\n\nbe    treated    as)    an   ordinary     stock    redemption        note     because\n\nclassifying it as such would elevate form over substance.                     ERISA's\n\nstatutory scheme, taken as a whole, ensures that even though an\n\nESOP is denominated as a \"stock ownership plan,\" it offers retirees\n\na    choice   between    continued      stock   ownership      and    a     pecuniary\n\nretirement benefit. It gives that choice to the employee by giving\n\nhim, in the first instance, an unqualified right to demand stock.\n\nIf there is a ready market for the stock, the employee can convert\n\nit into cash quite easily.        If, however, the employer's shares are\n\nnot readily tradeable, ERISA makes certain that the ESOP provides\n\nhim an equivalent mechanism for converting the stock into cash.\n\n\n                                        -24-\n\f            So it was here.        When the appellant's ESOP benefits came\n\ndue,   he   elected   not     to   take    stock   ownership    in   the   debtor,\n\npreferring instead to convert shares that were not readily tradable\n\ninto cash.    The debtor honored that election.             It chose, however,\n\nto defer a portion of its payment obligations.              By structuring the\n\ntransaction to play out over time, the debtor placed the appellant\n\nin his present predicament as a noteholder.\n\n            This chronology helps to explain why the appellant's\n\nclaim for payment due on the Note should not be viewed in the same\n\nlight as claims arising from stock redemption notes that have a\n\nmore conventional genesis.          The appellant's election made manifest\n\nhis intention to refrain from becoming an equity investor (with all\n\nthe risks attendant thereto).          Under these circumstances, there is\n\na strong policy argument that the Note should be viewed for what it\n\nis:    a    note   received    in   partial      payment   of   retirement   plan\n\nbenefits.\n\n            To sum up, it is readily evident that the Note on which\n\nthe appellant's claim is based did not arise from a conventional\n\nstock redemption.       Thus, the underlying rationale for no-fault\n\nequitable subordination is so severely undercut as to be worthless.\n\nHere, moreover, the lower courts gave no other reason, cognizable\n\nin equity, for subordinating the appellant's claim.\n\n            In other circumstances, we might remand for further\n\nproceedings; after all, an individualized assessment of what a\n\n\n                                          -25-\n\fcreditor did or failed to do in relation to his claim ordinarily\n\nentails questions of fact.         This case, however, is one in which the\n\nnature of the appellant's conduct is undisputed.                    Under such\n\ncircumstances, a remand would serve no useful purpose. There is no\n\nevidence of any misconduct attributable to the appellant nor does\n\nanything      about     his   behavior   offer    the   slightest   reason   for\n\nequitable subordination.           We hold, therefore, that there is no\n\nequitable basis for subordinating the appellant's claim under 11\n\nU.S.C. § 510(c)(1).5           This holding necessarily results in the\n\nreversal of the bankruptcy court's transfer of the Attachment based\n\non section 510(c)(2), as a lien can only be transferred under that\n\nsection when the underlying claim has been equitably subordinated.\n\nSee id. 510(c)(2).\n\nIII.       CONCLUSION\n\n               We need go no further.            Consistent with the Supreme\n\nCourt's recent case law, we hold that bankruptcy courts may not\n\ncategorically subordinate classes of claims based on generalized\n\npolicy considerations. Instead, they must exercise their equitable\n\ndiscretion to decide whether or not to subordinate particular\n\nclaims on a case-by-case basis.            Given the facts of this case, we\n\nhold as a matter of law that it was improper for the bankruptcy\n\ncourt, in the absence of misconduct on the part of the note holder\n\n\n\n       5\n      We do not answer the broader question, left open in Noland,\nof whether the lack of creditor misconduct is itself dispositive.\n\n                                         -26-\n\for   any     other     special      circumstance,     to      impose    equitable\n\nsubordination    on    a   claim    that    arises   from   a   promissory      note\n\nreceived in connection with the deferred payment of retirement\n\nbenefits under an ERISA-qualified ESOP. Accordingly, the decisions\n\nbelow must be reversed.\n\n\n\n             We reverse the order of the district court equitably\n\nsubordinating        the   appellant's       claim    and     transferring       the\n\nAttachment, remand the case to the district court, and direct that\n\ncourt   to   remand    the   case    to    the   bankruptcy     court   with    such\n\ninstructions as may be necessary to carry out our holding.

After reviewing recent Supreme Court precedents, we hold, as a general matter, that bankruptcy courts may not use their powers of equitable subordination to downgrade stock redemption claims on a categorical basis; instead, they must evaluate the propriety of equitable subordination case by case. Taking this general approach, we hold, more specifically, that the stock redemption note at issue here &#8212; a note delivered in partial liquidation of the retirement benefits of a retiring employee under an employee stock ownership plan &#8212; may not be equitably subordinated because the debtor has not made a particularized showing of special circumstances (such as misconduct on the part of the note holder). Consequently, we reverse the contrary rulings of the courts below, vacate the order appealed from, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The material facts are not in dispute. The debtor, Merrimac Paper Company, Inc., is a Delaware corporation that maintains its principal place of business in Massachusetts. The appellant, Ralph Harrison, worked for the debtor in an executive capacity from 1963 to 1999. When the debtor adopted an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) in 1985, the appellant became a participant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ESOP was qualified under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1107(d)(6); <i>see also</i> 26 U.S.C. &#167; 4975(e)(7). Pursuant to its terms, the debtor established a trust and proceeded to make variable annual contributions to it (in amounts designated from time to time by its board of directors). The trust invested the funds on behalf of participating employees, primarily in the debtor's stock. The trust maintained an individual account for each participant, specifying his or her share of the investments held in trust. Over time, the ESOP (and through it, the debtor's employees as a class) came to own the majority of the debtor's issued and outstanding common stock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ESOP provided that upon a participating employee's separation from service, the vested portion of that employee's individual account would be distributed to him or her in the form of the debtor's stock. Because the stock was not publicly traded, a retiring employee had the option either to retain the stock received or, at any time within fifteen months of the distribution date, to compel the debtor to redeem it at fair market value (a step known as the \"put option\"). Upon an employee's exercise of the put option, the debtor could elect to pay for the redeemed stock in substantially equal annual payments over a period not to exceed five years. If the debtor chose to make installment payments, it was required to pay interest on the deferred balance and to furnish adequate security.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the appellant's retirement in 1999, his ESOP account held approximately 6% of the debtor's common stock. He indicated an intention to exercise the put option. Following an appraisal, the appellant's shares were valued at $1,116,200.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 19, 2000, the appellant formally exercised the put option. In simultaneous transactions, he constructively received the shares and sold them back to the debtor, which gave him a promissory note for $916,300 (the Note). This amount equaled the appraised value of the shares less a cash advance paid earlier to the appellant. The Note bore interest at a rate of 8.5% per annum and called for the principal balance to be amortized in three equal annual installments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant received the first installment payment on January 4, 2001. The debtor thereafter encountered financial difficulties and failed to make the next annual payment. On September 6, 2002, the appellant accelerated the Note and brought suit in a Massachusetts state court for breach of contract based on the failure to pay. A few days later, the appellant attached the debtor's real estate (the Attachment) to secure payment of the balance owed on the Note.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's state court complaint did not mention ERISA. He remedied this omission in January of 2003, when he instituted a second suit in the federal district court. His federal court complaint named the debtor, the ESOP, and the ESOP's trustees as defendants and averred, inter alia, that these defendants had denied him ERISA benefits (specifically, the unpaid balance due on the Note) and, in the bargain, had failed to fulfill their fiduciary duties under ERISA. The debtor countered by removing the state court action to the federal court on the ground that it constituted part and parcel of the same case or controversy as the newly filed federal action. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1367, 1441.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two months later, the debtor filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1101-1174. The docketing of the bankruptcy petition automatically stayed the appellant's two pending actions. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 362(a)(1). The appellant filed a timely claim in the bankruptcy proceedings and noted on the claim form that he sought \"ERISA benefits.\" He attached to the claim copies of both the Note and the state court complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 20, 2003, the debtor commenced an adversary proceeding against the appellant in an effort to subordinate his claim. <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167; 510(b), (c)(1). It also sought to have the Attachment transferred to the bankruptcy estate for the benefit of creditors generally. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 510(c)(2). The debtor's ensuing motion for summary judgment characterized the appellant's claim as a \"stock redemption claim\" but did specify that it had its genesis in an ESOP retirement distribution. While its summary judgment motion was pending, the debtor filed its proposed plan of reorganization. That plan contemplated that the claims of general unsecured creditors would have priority over stock redemption claims (whether secured or unsecured), regardless of their origin. As the debtor could only pay a fraction of the value of the general unsecured claims, this meant that the Note would be extinguished and the appellant would receive nothing on it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant opposed both the summary judgment motion and the reorganization plan, arguing among other things that payment of ERISA-protected employee benefits pursuant to an ESOP is qualitatively different than a garden-variety stock redemption and that, even if the court treated his claim as a stock redemption claim notwithstanding its ERISA-connected roots, equitable subordination was not available in the absence of any inequitable conduct on his part. The appellant also launched a counteroffensive; he asked the district court to withdraw the adversary proceeding, challenging the bankruptcy court's jurisdiction on the ground that the adversary proceeding required the resolution of ERISA issues. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 157(d) (stating that a district court shall withdraw such a proceeding if it requires consideration of both bankruptcy law and other federal law). Concomitantly, the appellant asked the bankruptcy court to lift the automatic stay insofar as it pertained to his pending actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This counteroffensive bore no fruit. The district court denied the motion to withdraw the adversary proceeding on July 8, 2003, holding that the proceeding did not involve a substantial question of ERISA law. The bankruptcy court denied without prejudice the appellant's motion to lift the automatic stay. The court explained that, in its view, \"many if not all of the issues\" presented in the original litigation would be rendered moot by its resolution of the matters pending in the bankruptcy court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 7, 2003, the bankruptcy court granted the debtor's summary judgment motion and subordinated the appellant's claim. <i>In re Merrimac Paper Co.,</i> 303 B.R. 710, 722-23 (Bankr.D.Mass.2003) (<i>Merrimac I</i>). The court considered the appellant to have made two claims, namely, a straightforward claim for payment of the Note and an ERISA claim unrelated to the Note. <i>See id.</i> at 718. With respect to the latter claim, the court remarked that it had looked to the complaint in the original federal court action and considered the claim to be for \"damages that arise from [the appellant's] sale of stock to Merrimac.\" <i>Id.</i> at 719.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In evaluating these claims, the bankruptcy court first considered section 510(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, which requires subordination of any and all claims arising from \"rescission of a purchase or sale of a security of the debtor.\" The court found that the claim under the Note arose from the enforcement of a debt, not the sale of a security. <i>Id.</i> at 718-19. Accordingly, the claim could not be subordinated under section 510(b). <i>Id.</i> at 719. Conversely, the court characterized what it described as the \"unrelated\" ERISA claim as one arising out of the sale of stock and, thus, found it to be within the purview of section 510(b). <i>Id.</i> at 719-20. Consequently, that claim was subordinated. <i>Id.</i> at 720.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then turned to the question of equitable subordination. <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167; 510(c) (authorizing a bankruptcy court to subordinate any and all claims for equitable reasons). The court ruled that, under traditional principles of equitable subordination, all claims based on stock redemption notes must be subordinated. <i>Id.</i> at 720-22. Hence, insofar as the appellant's claim was based on the Note, it had to be equitably subordinated. <i>Id.</i> at 722. Consistent with these holdings, the court transferred the appellant's interest in the Attachment to the bankruptcy estate, <i>see</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167; 510(c)(2), and confirmed the debtor's plan of reorganization.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant unsuccessfully appealed the subordination order to the district court. <i>See In re Merrimac Paper Co.,</i> 317 B.R. 215, 223 (D.Mass.2004) (<i>Merrimac II</i>); <i>see also</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 158(c). This timely appeal followed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we serve as a second tier of appellate review, we \"cede no special deference to the district court's initial review.\" <i>In re Bank of New Engl. Corp.,</i> 364 F.3d 355, 361 (1st Cir.2004). Rather, we review directly the bankruptcy court's determination, scrutinizing its findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo. <i>In re Carp,</i> 340 F.3d 15, 21 (1st Cir.2003). The application of the Bankruptcy Code to the facts as found (or, as here, to undisputed facts) presents a mixed question of law and fact, reviewable for clear error \"unless the bankruptcy court's analysis was based on a mistaken view of the legal principles involved.\" <i>Id.</i> at 22; <i>see also In re Indep. Eng'g Co.,</i> 197 F.3d 13, 16 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The threshold question here involves the precise nature of the claims that are subject to review. The debtor argues that we should review only the propriety vel non of equitable subordination of the Note claim, as any ERISA claim distinct from the Note claim was never properly pleaded (or, if properly pleaded, was waived). The appellant disputes this characterization of the record, but insists that, in all events, such issues are superfluous. He submits that were we to reverse the bankruptcy court's ukase equitably subordinating the Note claim, he will obtain complete relief whether or not his ERISA claim was properly pleaded or punctiliously preserved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the appellant. And because we hold that equitable subordination of the Note claim was unwarranted here, <i>see</i> text <i>infra,</i> we need not decide independently the propriety of the bankruptcy court's subordination of what it viewed as the appellant's separate ERISA claim under section 510(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Equitable Subordination.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 510(c) of the Bankruptcy Code provides in pertinent part that a bankruptcy court may, \"under principles of equitable subordination, subordinate for purposes of distribution all or part of an allowed claim to all or part of another allowed claim.\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 510(c)(1). The Code does not elaborate upon the nature of these principles, but the Supreme Court has made clear that in administering this section, the starting point should be the compendium of judge-made principles of equitable subordination that existed prior to 1978 (when Congress enacted the Bankruptcy Code). <i>See United States v. Noland,</i> 517 U.S. 535, 539, 116 S.Ct. 1524, 134 L.Ed.2d 748 (1996). This is not to say that section 510(c) froze pre-1978 law in place. The federal courts have latitude to tweak preexisting equitable principles and to develop new ones. <i>See id.</i> at 540, 116 S.Ct. 1524.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The contours of equitable subordination are well delineated in a Fifth Circuit opinion, <i>In re Mobile Steel Co.,</i> 563 F.2d 692 (5th Cir.1977) (an opinion that the <i>Noland</i> Court deemed \"influential,\" 517 U.S. at 538, 116 S.Ct. 1524). First, equitable subordination demands that the claimant be found to have engaged in inequitable conduct. <i>Mobile Steel,</i> 563 F.2d at 700. Second, the misconduct must have either resulted in injury to creditors or given the claimant an unfair advantage. <i>Id.</i> Third, equitable subordination of the claim must not be in conflict with the provisions of federal bankruptcy law. <i>Id.</i> This court has adopted <i>Mobile Steel</i> as the gold standard for section 510(c) cases. <i>See In re 604 Columbus Ave. Realty Trust,</i> 968 F.2d 1332, 1353 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case at hand, the debtor questions the applicability of the <i>Mobile Steel</i> criteria. It points to an older body of precedent in this circuit holding that stock redemption claims, as a class, are subject to equitable subordination without any showing of inequitable conduct on the claimant's part. <i>See Matthews Bros. v. Pullen,</i> 268 F. 827 (1st Cir.1920); <i>Keith v. Kilmer</i> (<i>In re Nat'l Piano Co.</i>), 261 F. 733 (1st Cir.1919). This line of authority derives from the general precept that stockholders may not receive any of the assets of an insolvent corporation until the corporation's creditors are paid in full. <i>See, e.g., In re Geneva Steel Co.,</i> 281 F.3d 1173, 1181 n. 4 (10th Cir.2002) (\"Under [the absolute priority rule], unsecured creditors stand ahead of investors in the receiving line and their claims must be satisfied before any investment loss is compensated.\"). The driving force behind decisions such as <i>Matthews Bros.</i> and <i>Keith</i> is the desire to prevent stockholders from subverting this precept by structuring hastily engineered stock redemption agreements as a means of substituting debt for equity (and, thus, sharing company assets ratably with creditors). <i>See Keith,</i> 261 F. at 734 (holding that \"a stockholder, contracting with the corporation ... for the benefit of himself,\" may not \"through an executory contract, cease to be a stockholder, and become a creditor, to share in competition with other creditors in the assets of the corporation when bankrupt\"); <i>see also Matthews Bros.,</i> 268 F. at 828 (clarifying that <i>Keith</i> applies even though the parties acted in good faith and the corporation was solvent when the stock redemption agreement was executed).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Keith</i> and <i>Matthews Bros.</i> long predated both the Bankruptcy Code and the enactment of ERISA. Nevertheless, lower courts have taken the position that such categorical \"no-fault\" subordination remains appropriate under section 510(c) with respect to claims emanating from stock redemption agreements. <i>See, e.g., In re Main St. Brewing Co.,</i> 210 B.R. 662, 665-66 (Bankr.D.Mass.1997); <i>In re New Era Packaging, Inc.,</i> 186 B.R. 329, 335-36 (Bankr.D.Mass.1995); <i>In re SPM Mfg. Corp.,</i> 163 B.R. 411, 416 (Bankr.D.Mass.1994). The primary support for the continued application of these hoary precedents comes from statements made during floor debates incident to passage of the 1978 bankruptcy bill, whose sponsors noted, in joint statements, that existing case law would help to establish the principles of equitable subordination. <i>See</i> 124 Cong. Rec. 32398 (1978) (statement of Rep. Edwards), <i>reprinted in</i> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6436, 6452; 124 Cong. Rec. 33998 (1978) (statement of Sen. DeConcini), <i>reprinted in</i> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6505, 6521; <i>see also SPM Mfg.,</i> 163 B.R. at 414 (quoting joint floor statement for proposition that, \"under existing case law, a claim is generally subordinated ... [if] the claim itself is of a status susceptible to subordination, such as a penalty\"). Those courts believed that stock redemption claims, like penalties, were susceptible of subordination based on their essential nature. So too the bankruptcy court in the instant case, which accepted this reasoning in subordinating the appellant's claim. <i>Merrimac I,</i> 303 B.R. at 720-23.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court was more cautious. It recognized that we had not reaffirmed our turn-of-the-century precedents since the passage of section 510(c), but ultimately concluded that the categorical rule of <i>Keith</i> and <i>Matthews Bros.</i> would survive. <i>Merrimac II,</i> 317 B.R. at 221. The court based this conclusion on our 1986 affirmance, without opinion, in <i>Liebowitz v. Columbia Packing Co.,</i> 56 B.R. 222 (D.Mass.1985), <i>aff'd,</i> 802 F.2d 439 (1st Cir.1986) (table). <i>See Merrimac II,</i> 317 B.R. at 221.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Liebowitz,</i> however, is a very slender reed. Our opinion is unpublished and unpublished opinions have no precedential force. <i>See United States v. Meade,</i> 110 F.3d 190, 202 n. 23 (1st Cir.1997); <i>see also</i> 1st Cir. R. 32.3(a)(2). Thus, our affirmance in <i>Liebowitz</i> is of no consequence. More importantly, two Supreme Court cases decided subsequent to <i>Liebowitz</i> dispel any notion that a bankruptcy court must categorically impose equitable subordination merely because a claim arises out of a note taken in connection with a redemption of corporate stock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first of these cases is <i>Noland.</i> There, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed a post-petition claim for a noncompensatory tax penalty against a bankrupt corporation. <i>Noland,</i> 517 U.S. at 536, 116 S.Ct. 1524. Such a claim ordinarily would be entitled to first priority in bankruptcy as an administrative expense. <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 503(b)(1)(C), 507(a)(1). Although the bankruptcy court found no misconduct on the part of the IRS, it ordered the penalty claim equitably subordinated under section 510(c) to avoid the perceived unfairness of allowing the IRS to take precedence over secured and unsecured creditors who had given value to the business. The Sixth Circuit affirmed, looking to the legislative history of the Bankruptcy Code and holding that a tax penalty claim could be subordinated, even in the absence of inequitable conduct on the claimant's part. <i>In re First Truck Lines, Inc.,</i> 48 F.3d 210, 214-18 (6th Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court reversed. It made clear that the matter of equitable subordination had to be approached at a judicial rather than legislative level. <i>Noland,</i> 517 U.S. at 543, 116 S.Ct. 1524. Thus, section 510(c)'s reference to \"principles of equitable subordination\" would permit a court sitting in equity to \"make exceptions to a general rule when justified by particular facts.\" <i>Id.</i> at 540, 116 S.Ct. 1524. Such case-by-case adjudication is at the core of judicial competence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court made equally clear, however, that courts were not authorized to subordinate entire classes of claims based \"not on individual equities but on the supposedly general unfairness\" of preferring that class of claims over another. <i>Id.</i> at 540-41, 116 S.Ct. 1524. Such categorical judgments are legislative in nature; they \"are not dictated or illuminated by principles of equity and do not fall within the judicial power of equitable subordination.\" <i>Id.</i> at 541, 116 S.Ct. 1524 (quoting <i>In re Burden,</i> 917 F.2d 115, 122 (3d Cir.1990) (Alito, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)). The Court emphasized that \"Congress could have, but did not, deny . . . tax penalties the first priority given to other administrative expenses,\" and ruled that \"bankruptcy courts may not take it upon themselves to make that categorical determination under the guise of equitable subordination.\" <i>Id.</i> at 543, 116 S.Ct. 1524.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In delineating the scope of the bankruptcy court's authority to subordinate claims under section 510(c), the <i>Noland</i> Court specifically rejected any contrary intimations found in the legislative history. In language that leaves no room for interpretation, the Court specifically stated that, as a fundamental matter, the legislative history of section 510(c) \"cannot be read to convert statutory leeway for judicial development of a rule on particularized exceptions into delegated authority to revise statutory categorization.\" <i>Id.</i> at 542, 116 S.Ct. 1524. Finally, despite its earlier endorsement of <i>Mobile Steel</i> as the benchmark of equitable subordination, the Court expressly declined to rule that equitable subordination was unavailable merely because the IRS was not guilty of misconduct. <i>See id.</i> at 543 (leaving open the question of whether \"a bankruptcy court must always find creditor misconduct before a claim may be equitably subordinated\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the same year, the Court decided <i>United States v. Reorganized CF &amp; I Fabricators of Utah, Inc.,</i> 518 U.S. 213, 116 S.Ct. 2106, 135 L.Ed.2d 506 (1996). There, the IRS had filed a proof of claim under 26 U.S.C. &#167; 4971(a), a statute that imposed a 10% tax on the \"accumulated funding deficiency\" of certain corporate pension plans. <i>Id.</i> at 216, 116 S.Ct. 2106. The IRS sought to classify its claim as one for excise taxes in order to receive priority under what is now 11 U.S.C. &#167; 507(a)(8)(E). The bankruptcy court held that the claim did not qualify as such. <i>Reorganized CF &amp; I,</i> 518 U.S. at 216-17, 116 S.Ct. 2106. The claim was thus classified as an unsecured claim in the corporation's Chapter 11 reorganization plan, but the bankruptcy court nevertheless subordinated it to the claims of general unsecured creditors based on its status as a penalty. <i>Id.</i> at 227, 116 S.Ct. 2106.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court again reversed. The Court noted that the case was different than <i>Noland</i> in that \"<i>Noland</i> passed on the subordination from a higher priority class to the residual category . . . whereas here the subordination was imposed upon a disfavored subgroup within the residual category.\" <i>Id.</i> at 229, 116 S.Ct. 2106. Still, the Court read <i>Noland</i> as standing for the proposition that the \"categorical reordering of priorities that takes place at the legislative level of consideration is beyond the scope of judicial authority\" with respect to equitable subordination under section 510(c). <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These two cases make it transparently clear that the bankruptcy court erred in subordinating both the secured and unsecured portions of the appellant's claim. The appellant has a non-priority claim based on the Note, but &#8212; just as in <i>CF &amp; I</i> &#8212; the bankruptcy court's decision to subordinate the claim was not premised on the specific facts of the case but, rather, on the taxonomic status of the claim. <i>See Merrimac I,</i> 303 B.R. at 722.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The debtor attempts to resist this conclusion by contending that stock redemption claims, as a class, are subject to no-fault equitable subordination under <i>Keith</i> and <i>Matthews Bros.</i> It cites <i>SPM Manufacturing</i> as a \"leading\" bankruptcy court decision holding that this rule survives the passage of the Bankruptcy Code. We reject this contention, as it fails to take into account the <i>Noland</i> Court's unambiguous repudiation of the legislative history upon which the <i>SPM Manufacturing</i> court relied.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the debtor tries to distinguish <i>Noland</i> on the ground that \"it focuses exclusively on whether a bankruptcy court can categorically subordinate . . . claims that Congress specifically chose to treat as priority claims.\" Appellee's Br. at 20. In its view, <i>Noland</i> \"does not take away a bankruptcy court's ability to [equitably] subordinate . . . types of claims to which Congress has not assigned a specific priority.\" <i>Id.</i> Conspicuously absent from this line of argument is any acknowledgment of <i>Reorganized CF &amp; I,</i> which clearly and directly rejected the very distinction that the debtor now strives to draw. <i>See Reorganized CF &amp; I,</i> 518 U.S. at 229, 116 S.Ct. 2106. Taken together, the principles enunciated in <i>Noland</i> and <i>Reorganized CF &amp; I</i> vividly demonstrate why the bankruptcy court erred in equitably subordinating the appellant's claim based on nothing more than its classification as a stock redemption claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not lightly discard our prior precedents. Stare decisis must yield, however, when a \"preexisting panel opinion is undermined by subsequently announced controlling authority, such as a decision of the Supreme Court.\" <i>Eulitt v. Me., Dep't of Educ.,</i> 386 F.3d 344, 349 (1st Cir.2004). Here, the decisions in <i>Noland</i> and <i>Reorganized CF &amp; I,</i> read together, constitute such supervening authority. We therefore abrogate the categorical rule of <i>Keith</i> and <i>Matthews Bros.</i> and hold that claims founded on stock redemption notes are not to be automatically subordinated solely on the basis of their intrinsic nature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not, however, entirely reject the reasoning of <i>Keith</i> and <i>Matthews Bros.</i> Indeed, we believe the core principle of these decisions &#8212; that equity holders should not be able artificially to evade the debt-over-equity paradigm &#8212; is generally sound. But what <i>Noland</i> and <i>Reorganized CF &amp; I</i> tell us is that even if claims arising out of stock redemption notes <i>generally</i> should be regarded as suspect, and thus subject to subordination, a court sitting in equity must nonetheless consider whether subordinating a <i>particular</i> claim would be fair based on the totality of the circumstances in the individual case. <i>Cf. Noland,</i> 517 U.S. at 540, 116 S.Ct. 1524 (holding that although penalty claims cannot be categorically subordinated, they may be subordinated on a case-by-case basis).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add a coda. Our prior cases adopting the first prong of <i>Mobile Steel, see, e.g., 604 Columbus Ave. Realty Trust,</i> 968 F.2d at 1353, did not deal with the type of situations described in <i>Keith</i> and <i>Matthews Bros.</i> This fact, combined with the <i>Noland</i> Court's specific reservation of the question, 517 U.S. at 543, 116 S.Ct. 1524, leaves it far from clear whether the inequitable conduct requirement would apply in such circumstances. As we have said, however, that is a question for another day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The Equities.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our holding that stock redemption claims, as a class, may not automatically be subjected to equitable subordination does not end our odyssey. We therefore turn to the case-specific inquiry that the bankruptcy court failed to undertake: do the equities of this case support the equitable subordination of the appellant's stock redemption note claim? In undertaking this assessment, we begin with an explanation of the statutory mechanism underpinning the creation and use of ESOPs. An ESOP is an oddity among ERISA plans. It serves three discrete purposes: it functions as an employee retirement benefit plan, as a device for increasing a corporation's capitalization, and as a method of fostering loyalty. <i>See Lalonde v. Textron, Inc.,</i> 369 F.3d 1, 4 n. 7 (1st Cir.2004). Notwithstanding the fact that its focus is on investing exclusively in company stock, an ESOP is considered a \"stock bonus plan\" and, as such, must meet various regulatory benchmarks prescribed by Congress and by the Secretary of the Treasury. 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1107(d)(6)(A). The benchmarks include a mandate that an ESOP must satisfy the cash distribution requirement of section 409(h) of the Internal Revenue Code. <i>See</i> 26 U.S.C. &#167; 401(a)(23). That section provides that beneficiaries of such a plan may demand their share of employer securities upon retirement, <i>id.</i> &#167; 409(h)(1)(A), and \"if the employer securities are not readily tradable on an established market,\" a retiring employee may \"require that the employer repurchase [the] employer securities under a fair valuation formula,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 409(h)(1)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This latter choice is the put option, and its exercise is limited to a relatively brief interval following separation from service (by retirement or otherwise). <i>See id.</i> &#167; 409(h)(4). When an employer is subject to the put option (i.e., when, and only when, its stock is not readily tradable), the employer may elect to pay the repurchase price over a period not to exceed five years. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 409(h)(5)(A). Once that election is made, the employer must post adequate security. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 409(h)(5)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having limned the origins of the Note, we look next to the equities of subordinating the appellant's claim. Any case-by-case analysis of the equities of subordinating a particular claim that arises out of a stock redemption must begin with an examination of whether the underlying rationale for the <i>Keith</i> rule applies. In a pre-<i>Noland</i> case, the Seventh Circuit described that rationale as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Stock redemption] claims are, in substance, based on equity interests. When [the holders of those claims] invested in [the corporation], they positioned themselves to benefit if the company performed well, but they also accepted the risk that the company might perform poorly. Thus [they] accepted risks and benefits that . . . unsecured creditors did not, and as such their equity interests were legally subordinate to possible claims of unsecured creditors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Matter of Envirodyne Indus., Inc.,</i> 79 F.3d 579, 583 (7th Cir.1996). This rationale does not apply to the appellant's claim for several reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the stock redemption transaction in this case occurred within the ERISA framework. That matters because a participant in an ERISA plan does not assume the same levels of risk as a typical equity investor. Indeed, one of ERISA's principal purposes is to minimize risks to a participant's retirement benefits. <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1001(b); <i>see also Nachman Corp. v. Pension Benefit Guar. Corp.,</i> 446 U.S. 359, 375, 100 S.Ct. 1723, 64 L.Ed.2d 354 (1980) (stating that ERISA seeks to ensure that \"if a worker has been promised a defined pension benefit upon retirement &#8212; and if he has fulfilled whatever conditions are required to obtain a vested benefit &#8212; he will actually receive it\"). Thus, although the employee's position entails market risk during the period of employment (the ESOP holds the stock in trust for its participants, and so the employee is, functionally, a stockholder), ERISA seeks to eliminate that risk once retirement occurs. The ordinary repurchase by a company of its stock carries with it the implied condition that payment is contingent on the fulfillment of obligations to other creditors. <i>Cf. Robinson v. Wangemann,</i> 75 F.2d 756, 757-58 (5th Cir.1935) (implying the existence of such a condition). The mandates of ERISA, however &#8212; particularly its requirement that the holders of ESOP-spawned stock redemption notes be given adequate security &#8212; argue persuasively against the implication of any such condition where an ERISA-qualified ESOP is involved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add, moreover, that this Note is not (and should not be treated as) an ordinary stock redemption note because classifying it as such would elevate form over substance. ERISA's statutory scheme, taken as a whole, ensures that even though an ESOP is denominated as a \"stock ownership plan,\" it offers retirees a choice between continued stock ownership and a pecuniary retirement benefit. It gives that choice to the employee by giving him, in the first instance, an unqualified right to demand stock. If there is a ready market for the stock, the employee can convert it into cash quite easily. If, however, the employer's shares are not readily tradeable, ERISA makes certain that the ESOP provides him an equivalent mechanism for converting the stock into cash.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So it was here. When the appellant's ESOP benefits came due, he elected not to take stock ownership in the debtor, preferring instead to convert shares that were not readily tradable into cash. The debtor honored that election. It chose, however, to defer a portion of its payment obligations. By structuring the transaction to play out over time, the debtor placed the appellant in his present predicament as a noteholder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This chronology helps to explain why the appellant's claim for payment due on the Note should not be viewed in the same light as claims arising from stock redemption notes that have a more conventional genesis. The appellant's election made manifest his intention to refrain from becoming an equity investor (with all the risks attendant thereto). Under these circumstances, there is a strong policy argument that the Note should be viewed for what it is: a note received in partial payment of retirement plan benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, it is readily evident that the Note on which the appellant's claim is based did not arise from a conventional stock redemption. Thus, the underlying rationale for no-fault equitable subordination is so severely undercut as to be worthless. Here, moreover, the lower courts gave no other reason, cognizable in equity, for subordinating the appellant's claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In other circumstances, we might remand for further proceedings; after all, an individualized assessment of what a creditor did or failed to do in relation to his claim ordinarily entails questions of fact. This case, however, is one in which the nature of the appellant's conduct is undisputed. Under such circumstances, a remand would serve no useful purpose. There is no evidence of any misconduct attributable to the appellant nor does anything about his behavior offer the slightest reason for equitable subordination. We hold, therefore, that there is no equitable basis for subordinating the appellant's claim under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 510(c)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> This holding necessarily results in the reversal of the bankruptcy court's transfer of the Attachment based on section 510(c)(2), as a lien can only be transferred under that section when the underlying claim has been equitably subordinated. <i>See id.</i> 510(c)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Consistent with the Supreme Court's recent case law, we hold that bankruptcy courts may not categorically subordinate classes of claims based on generalized policy considerations. Instead, they must exercise their equitable discretion to decide whether or not to subordinate particular claims on a case-by-case basis. Given the facts of this case, we hold as a matter of law that it was improper for the bankruptcy court, in the absence of misconduct on the part of the note holder or any other special circumstance, to impose equitable subordination on a claim that arises from a promissory note received in connection with the deferred payment of retirement benefits under an ERISA-qualified ESOP.

After reviewing recent Supreme Court precedents, we hold, as a general matter, that bankruptcy courts may not use their powers of equitable subordination to downgrade stock redemption claims on a categorical basis; instead, they must evaluate the propriety of equitable subordination case by case. Taking this general approach, we hold, more specifically, that the stock redemption note at issue here &#8212; a note delivered in partial liquidation of the retirement benefits of a retiring employee under an employee stock ownership plan &#8212; may not be equitably subordinated because the debtor has not made a particularized showing of special circumstances (such as misconduct on the part of the note holder). Consequently, we reverse the contrary rulings of the courts below, vacate the order appealed from, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The material facts are not in dispute. The debtor, Merrimac Paper Company, Inc., is a Delaware corporation that maintains its principal place of business in Massachusetts. The appellant, Ralph Harrison, worked for the debtor in an executive capacity from 1963 to 1999. When the debtor adopted an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) in 1985, the appellant became a participant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ESOP was qualified under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1107(d)(6); <i>see also</i> 26 U.S.C. &#167; 4975(e)(7). Pursuant to its terms, the debtor established a trust and proceeded to make variable annual contributions to it (in amounts designated from time to time by its board of directors). The trust invested the funds on behalf of participating employees, primarily in the debtor's stock. The trust maintained an individual account for each participant, specifying his or her share of the investments held in trust. Over time, the ESOP (and through it, the debtor's employees as a class) came to own the majority of the debtor's issued and outstanding common stock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ESOP provided that upon a participating employee's separation from service, the vested portion of that employee's individual account would be distributed to him or her in the form of the debtor's stock. Because the stock was not publicly traded, a retiring employee had the option either to retain the stock received or, at any time within fifteen months of the distribution date, to compel the debtor to redeem it at fair market value (a step known as the \"put option\"). Upon an employee's exercise of the put option, the debtor could elect to pay for the redeemed stock in substantially equal annual payments over a period not to exceed five years. If the debtor chose to make installment payments, it was required to pay interest on the deferred balance and to furnish adequate security.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the appellant's retirement in 1999, his ESOP account held approximately 6% of the debtor's common stock. He indicated an intention to exercise the put option. Following an appraisal, the appellant's shares were valued at $1,116,200.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 19, 2000, the appellant formally exercised the put option. In simultaneous transactions, he constructively received the shares and sold them back to the debtor, which gave him a promissory note for $916,300 (the Note). This amount equaled the appraised value of the shares less a cash advance paid earlier to the appellant. The Note bore interest at a rate of 8.5% per annum and called for the principal balance to be amortized in three equal annual installments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant received the first installment payment on January 4, 2001. The debtor thereafter encountered financial difficulties and failed to make the next annual payment. On September 6, 2002, the appellant accelerated the Note and brought suit in a Massachusetts state court for breach of contract based on the failure to pay. A few days later, the appellant attached the debtor's real estate (the Attachment) to secure payment of the balance owed on the Note.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's state court complaint did not mention ERISA. He remedied this omission in January of 2003, when he instituted a second suit in the federal district court. His federal court complaint named the debtor, the ESOP, and the ESOP's trustees as defendants and averred, inter alia, that these defendants had denied him ERISA benefits (specifically, the unpaid balance due on the Note) and, in the bargain, had failed to fulfill their fiduciary duties under ERISA. The debtor countered by removing the state court action to the federal court on the ground that it constituted part and parcel of the same case or controversy as the newly filed federal action. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1367, 1441.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two months later, the debtor filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1101-1174. The docketing of the bankruptcy petition automatically stayed the appellant's two pending actions. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 362(a)(1). The appellant filed a timely claim in the bankruptcy proceedings and noted on the claim form that he sought \"ERISA benefits.\" He attached to the claim copies of both the Note and the state court complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 20, 2003, the debtor commenced an adversary proceeding against the appellant in an effort to subordinate his claim. <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167; 510(b), (c)(1). It also sought to have the Attachment transferred to the bankruptcy estate for the benefit of creditors generally. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 510(c)(2). The debtor's ensuing motion for summary judgment characterized the appellant's claim as a \"stock redemption claim\" but did specify that it had its genesis in an ESOP retirement distribution. While its summary judgment motion was pending, the debtor filed its proposed plan of reorganization. That plan contemplated that the claims of general unsecured creditors would have priority over stock redemption claims (whether secured or unsecured), regardless of their origin. As the debtor could only pay a fraction of the value of the general unsecured claims, this meant that the Note would be extinguished and the appellant would receive nothing on it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant opposed both the summary judgment motion and the reorganization plan, arguing among other things that payment of ERISA-protected employee benefits pursuant to an ESOP is qualitatively different than a garden-variety stock redemption and that, even if the court treated his claim as a stock redemption claim notwithstanding its ERISA-connected roots, equitable subordination was not available in the absence of any inequitable conduct on his part. The appellant also launched a counteroffensive; he asked the district court to withdraw the adversary proceeding, challenging the bankruptcy court's jurisdiction on the ground that the adversary proceeding required the resolution of ERISA issues. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 157(d) (stating that a district court shall withdraw such a proceeding if it requires consideration of both bankruptcy law and other federal law). Concomitantly, the appellant asked the bankruptcy court to lift the automatic stay insofar as it pertained to his pending actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This counteroffensive bore no fruit. The district court denied the motion to withdraw the adversary proceeding on July 8, 2003, holding that the proceeding did not involve a substantial question of ERISA law. The bankruptcy court denied without prejudice the appellant's motion to lift the automatic stay. The court explained that, in its view, \"many if not all of the issues\" presented in the original litigation would be rendered moot by its resolution of the matters pending in the bankruptcy court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 7, 2003, the bankruptcy court granted the debtor's summary judgment motion and subordinated the appellant's claim. <i>In re Merrimac Paper Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">710</span></span>, 722-23 (Bankr.D.Mass.2003) (<i>Merrimac I</i>). The court considered the appellant to have made two claims, namely, a straightforward claim for payment of the Note and an ERISA claim unrelated to the Note. <i>See id.</i> at 718. With respect to the latter claim, the court remarked that it had looked to the complaint in the original federal court action and considered the claim to be for \"damages that arise from [the appellant's] sale of stock to Merrimac.\" <i>Id.</i> at 719.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In evaluating these claims, the bankruptcy court first considered section 510(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, which requires subordination of any and all claims arising from \"rescission of a purchase or sale of a security of the debtor.\" The court found that the claim under the Note arose from the enforcement of a debt, not the sale of a security. <i>Id.</i> at 718-19. Accordingly, the claim could not be subordinated under section 510(b). <i>Id.</i> at 719. Conversely, the court characterized what it described as the \"unrelated\" ERISA claim as one arising out of the sale of stock and, thus, found it to be within the purview of section 510(b). <i>Id.</i> at 719-20. Consequently, that claim was subordinated. <i>Id.</i> at 720.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then turned to the question of equitable subordination. <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167; 510(c) (authorizing a bankruptcy court to subordinate any and all claims for equitable reasons). The court ruled that, under traditional principles of equitable subordination, all claims based on stock redemption notes must be subordinated. <i>Id.</i> at 720-22. Hence, insofar as the appellant's claim was based on the Note, it had to be equitably subordinated. <i>Id.</i> at 722. Consistent with these holdings, the court transferred the appellant's interest in the Attachment to the bankruptcy estate, <i>see</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167; 510(c)(2), and confirmed the debtor's plan of reorganization.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant unsuccessfully appealed the subordination order to the district court. <i>See In re Merrimac Paper Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1834544\"><a href=\"/opinion/1834544/in-re-merrimac-paper-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">317</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">215</span></a></span>, 223 (D.Mass.2004) (<i>Merrimac II</i>); <i>see also</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 158(c).

Rather, we review directly the bankruptcy court's determination, scrutinizing its findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo. <i>In re Carp,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">340</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></span>, 21 (1st Cir.2003). The application of the Bankruptcy Code to the facts as found (or, as here, to undisputed facts) presents a mixed question of law and fact, reviewable for clear error \"unless the bankruptcy court's analysis was based on a mistaken view of the legal principles involved.\" <i>Id.</i> at 22; <i>see also In re Indep.

The debtor argues that we should review only the propriety vel non of equitable subordination of the Note claim, as any ERISA claim distinct from the Note claim was never properly pleaded (or, if properly pleaded, was waived). The appellant disputes this characterization of the record, but insists that, in all events, such issues are superfluous. He submits that were we to reverse the bankruptcy court's ukase equitably subordinating the Note claim, he will obtain complete relief whether or not his ERISA claim was properly pleaded or punctiliously preserved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the appellant. And because we hold that equitable subordination of the Note claim was unwarranted here, <i>see</i> text <i>infra,</i> we need not decide independently the propriety of the bankruptcy court's subordination of what it viewed as the appellant's separate ERISA claim under section 510(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Equitable Subordination.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 510(c) of the Bankruptcy Code provides in pertinent part that a bankruptcy court may, \"under principles of equitable subordination, subordinate for purposes of distribution all or part of an allowed claim to all or part of another allowed claim.\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 510(c)(1). The Code does not elaborate upon the nature of these principles, but the Supreme Court has made clear that in administering this section, the starting point should be the compendium of judge-made principles of equitable subordination that existed prior to 1978 (when Congress enacted the Bankruptcy Code). <i>See United States v. Noland,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118024\"><a href=\"/opinion/118024/united-states-v-noland/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">535</span></a></span>, 539, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118024\"><a href=\"/opinion/118024/united-states-v-noland/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The federal courts have latitude to tweak preexisting equitable principles and to develop new ones. <i>See id.</i> at 540, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118024\"><a href=\"/opinion/118024/united-states-v-noland/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

First, equitable subordination demands that the claimant be found to have engaged in inequitable conduct. <i>Mobile Steel,</i> 563 F.2d at 700. Second, the misconduct must have either resulted in injury to creditors or given the claimant an unfair advantage. <i>Id.</i> Third, equitable subordination of the claim must not be in conflict with the provisions of federal bankruptcy law. <i>Id.</i> This court has adopted <i>Mobile Steel</i> as the gold standard for section 510(c) cases. <i>See In re 604 Columbus Ave. Realty Trust,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"586807\"><a href=\"/opinion/586807/in-re-604-columbus-avenue-realty-trust-debtor-capitol-bank-trust/\"><span class=\"volume\">968</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1332</span></a></span>, 1353 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case at hand, the debtor questions the applicability of the <i>Mobile Steel</i> criteria. It points to an older body of precedent in this circuit holding that stock redemption claims, as a class, are subject to equitable subordination without any showing of inequitable conduct on the claimant's part. <i>See Matthews Bros. v. Pullen,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">268</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">827</span></span> (1st Cir.1920); <i>Keith v.

This line of authority derives from the general precept that stockholders may not receive any of the assets of an insolvent corporation until the corporation's creditors are paid in full. <i>See, e.g., In re Geneva Steel Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"162082\"><a href=\"/opinion/162082/allen-v-geneva-steel-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">281</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1173</span></a></span>, 1181 n. 4 (10th Cir.2002) (\"Under [the absolute priority rule], unsecured creditors stand ahead of investors in the receiving line and their claims must be satisfied before any investment loss is compensated.\"). The driving force behind decisions such as <i>Matthews Bros.</i> and <i>Keith</i> is the desire to prevent stockholders from subverting this precept by structuring hastily engineered stock redemption agreements as a means of substituting debt for equity (and, thus, sharing company assets ratably with creditors). <i>See Keith,</i> 261 F. at 734 (holding that \"a stockholder, contracting with the corporation ... for the benefit of himself,\" may not \"through an executory contract, cease to be a stockholder, and become a creditor, to share in competition with other creditors in the assets of the corporation when bankrupt\"); <i>see also Matthews Bros.,</i> 268 F. at 828 (clarifying that <i>Keith</i> applies even though the parties acted in good faith and the corporation was solvent when the stock redemption agreement was executed).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Keith</i> and <i>Matthews Bros.</i> long predated both the Bankruptcy Code and the enactment of ERISA. Nevertheless, lower courts have taken the position that such categorical \"no-fault\" subordination remains appropriate under section 510(c) with respect to claims emanating from stock redemption agreements. <i>See, e.g., In re Main St. Brewing Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2000426\"><a href=\"/opinion/2000426/in-re-main-street-brewing-co-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">210</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">662</span></a></span>, 665-66 (Bankr.D.Mass.1997); <i>In re New Era Packaging, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1552064\"><a href=\"/opinion/1552064/in-re-new-era-packaging-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">186</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">329</span></a></span>, 335-36 (Bankr.D.Mass.1995); <i>In re SPM Mfg.

The primary support for the continued application of these hoary precedents comes from statements made during floor debates incident to passage of the 1978 bankruptcy bill, whose sponsors noted, in joint statements, that existing case law would help to establish the principles of equitable subordination. <i>See</i> 124 Cong. Rec. 32398 (1978) (statement of Rep. Edwards), <i>reprinted in</i> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6436, 6452; 124 Cong. Rec. 33998 (1978) (statement of Sen. DeConcini), <i>reprinted in</i> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6505, 6521; <i>see also SPM Mfg.,</i> 163 B.R. at 414 (quoting joint floor statement for proposition that, \"under existing case law, a claim is generally subordinated ... [if] the claim itself is of a status susceptible to subordination, such as a penalty\"). Those courts believed that stock redemption claims, like penalties, were susceptible of subordination based on their essential nature. So too the bankruptcy court in the instant case, which accepted this reasoning in subordinating the appellant's claim. <i>Merrimac I,</i> 303 B.R. at 720-23.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court was more cautious. It recognized that we had not reaffirmed our turn-of-the-century precedents since the passage of section 510(c), but ultimately concluded that the categorical rule of <i>Keith</i> and <i>Matthews Bros.</i> would survive. <i>Merrimac II,</i> 317 B.R. at 221. The court based this conclusion on our 1986 affirmance, without opinion, in <i>Liebowitz v. Columbia Packing Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1848107\"><a href=\"/opinion/1848107/liebowitz-v-columbia-packing-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">222</span></a></span> (D.Mass.1985), <i>aff'd,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">802</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">439</span></span> (1st Cir.1986) (table). <i>See Merrimac II,</i> 317 B.R. at 221.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Liebowitz,</i> however, is a very slender reed. Our opinion is unpublished and unpublished opinions have no precedential force. <i>See United States v.

R. 32.3(a)(2). Thus, our affirmance in <i>Liebowitz</i> is of no consequence. More importantly, two Supreme Court cases decided subsequent to <i>Liebowitz</i> dispel any notion that a bankruptcy court must categorically impose equitable subordination merely because a claim arises out of a note taken in connection with a redemption of corporate stock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first of these cases is <i>Noland.</i> There, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed a post-petition claim for a noncompensatory tax penalty against a bankrupt corporation. <i>Noland,</i> 517 U.S. at 536, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118024\"><a href=\"/opinion/118024/united-states-v-noland/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Such a claim ordinarily would be entitled to first priority in bankruptcy as an administrative expense. <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 503(b)(1)(C), 507(a)(1). Although the bankruptcy court found no misconduct on the part of the IRS, it ordered the penalty claim equitably subordinated under section 510(c) to avoid the perceived unfairness of allowing the IRS to take precedence over secured and unsecured creditors who had given value to the business. The Sixth Circuit affirmed, looking to the legislative history of the Bankruptcy Code and holding that a tax penalty claim could be subordinated, even in the absence of inequitable conduct on the claimant's part. <i>In re First Truck Lines, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"689940\"><a href=\"/opinion/689940/in-re-first-truck-lines-inc-debtor-united-states-of-america-v-thomas/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">210</span></a></span>, 214-18 (6th Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court reversed.

In language that leaves no room for interpretation, the Court specifically stated that, as a fundamental matter, the legislative history of section 510(c) \"cannot be read to convert statutory leeway for judicial development of a rule on particularized exceptions into delegated authority to revise statutory categorization.\" <i>Id.</i> at 542, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118024\"><a href=\"/opinion/118024/united-states-v-noland/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1524</span></a></span>. Finally, despite its earlier endorsement of <i>Mobile Steel</i> as the benchmark of equitable subordination, the Court expressly declined to rule that equitable subordination was unavailable merely because the IRS was not guilty of misconduct. <i>See id.</i> at 543 (leaving open the question of whether \"a bankruptcy court must always find creditor misconduct before a claim may be equitably subordinated\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the same year, the Court decided <i>United States v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">506</span></a></span> (1996). There, the IRS had filed a proof of claim under 26 U.S.C. &#167; 4971(a), a statute that imposed a 10% tax on the \"accumulated funding deficiency\" of certain corporate pension plans. <i>Id.</i> at 216, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118050\"><a href=\"/opinion/118050/united-states-v-reorganized-cfi-fabricators-of-utah-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2106</span></a></span>. The IRS sought to classify its claim as one for excise taxes in order to receive priority under what is now 11 U.S.C. &#167; 507(a)(8)(E). The bankruptcy court held that the claim did not qualify as such. <i>Reorganized CF &amp; I,</i> 518 U.S. at 216-17, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118050\"><a href=\"/opinion/118050/united-states-v-reorganized-cfi-fabricators-of-utah-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2106</span></a></span>. The claim was thus classified as an unsecured claim in the corporation's Chapter 11 reorganization plan, but the bankruptcy court nevertheless subordinated it to the claims of general unsecured creditors based on its status as a penalty. <i>Id.</i> at 227, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118050\"><a href=\"/opinion/118050/united-states-v-reorganized-cfi-fabricators-of-utah-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Court noted that the case was different than <i>Noland</i> in that \"<i>Noland</i> passed on the subordination from a higher priority class to the residual category . . . whereas here the subordination was imposed upon a disfavored subgroup within the residual category.\" <i>Id.</i> at 229, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118050\"><a href=\"/opinion/118050/united-states-v-reorganized-cfi-fabricators-of-utah-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2106</span></a></span>. Still, the Court read <i>Noland</i> as standing for the proposition that the \"categorical reordering of priorities that takes place at the legislative level of consideration is beyond the scope of judicial authority\" with respect to equitable subordination under section 510(c). <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These two cases make it transparently clear that the bankruptcy court erred in subordinating both the secured and unsecured portions of the appellant's claim. The appellant has a non-priority claim based on the Note, but &#8212; just as in <i>CF &amp; I</i> &#8212; the bankruptcy court's decision to subordinate the claim was not premised on the specific facts of the case but, rather, on the taxonomic status of the claim. <i>See Merrimac I,</i> 303 B.R. at 722.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The debtor attempts to resist this conclusion by contending that stock redemption claims, as a class, are subject to no-fault equitable subordination under <i>Keith</i> and <i>Matthews Bros.</i> It cites <i>SPM Manufacturing</i> as a \"leading\" bankruptcy court decision holding that this rule survives the passage of the Bankruptcy Code. We reject this contention, as it fails to take into account the <i>Noland</i> Court's unambiguous repudiation of the legislative history upon which the <i>SPM Manufacturing</i> court relied.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the debtor tries to distinguish <i>Noland</i> on the ground that \"it focuses exclusively on whether a bankruptcy court can categorically subordinate . . . claims that Congress specifically chose to treat as priority claims.\" Appellee's Br. at 20. In its view, <i>Noland</i> \"does not take away a bankruptcy court's ability to [equitably] subordinate . . . types of claims to which Congress has not assigned a specific priority.\" <i>Id.</i> Conspicuously absent from this line of argument is any acknowledgment of <i>Reorganized CF &amp; I,</i> which clearly and directly rejected the very distinction that the debtor now strives to draw. <i>See Reorganized CF &amp; I,</i> 518 U.S. at 229, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118050\"><a href=\"/opinion/118050/united-states-v-reorganized-cfi-fabricators-of-utah-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2106</span></a></span>. Taken together, the principles enunciated in <i>Noland</i> and <i>Reorganized CF &amp; I</i> vividly demonstrate why the bankruptcy court erred in equitably subordinating the appellant's claim based on nothing more than its classification as a stock redemption claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not lightly discard our prior precedents. Stare decisis must yield, however, when a \"preexisting panel opinion is undermined by subsequently announced controlling authority, such as a decision of the Supreme Court.\" <i>Eulitt v. Me., Dep't of Educ.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201301\"><a href=\"/opinion/201301/eulitt-v-me-dept-of-edu/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">344</span></a></span>, 349 (1st Cir.2004). Here, the decisions in <i>Noland</i> and <i>Reorganized CF &amp; I,</i> read together, constitute such supervening authority. We therefore abrogate the categorical rule of <i>Keith</i> and <i>Matthews Bros.</i> and hold that claims founded on stock redemption notes are not to be automatically subordinated solely on the basis of their intrinsic nature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not, however, entirely reject the reasoning of <i>Keith</i> and <i>Matthews Bros.</i> Indeed, we believe the core principle of these decisions &#8212; that equity holders should not be able artificially to evade the debt-over-equity paradigm &#8212; is generally sound. But what <i>Noland</i> and <i>Reorganized CF &amp; I</i> tell us is that even if claims arising out of stock redemption notes <i>generally</i> should be regarded as suspect, and thus subject to subordination, a court sitting in equity must nonetheless consider whether subordinating a <i>particular</i> claim would be fair based on the totality of the circumstances in the individual case. <i>Cf. Noland,</i> 517 U.S. at 540, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118024\"><a href=\"/opinion/118024/united-states-v-noland/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1524</span></a></span> (holding that although penalty claims cannot be categorically subordinated, they may be subordinated on a case-by-case basis).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add a coda. Our prior cases adopting the first prong of <i>Mobile Steel, see, e.g., 604 Columbus Ave. Realty Trust,</i> 968 F.2d at 1353, did not deal with the type of situations described in <i>Keith</i> and <i>Matthews Bros.</i> This fact, combined with the <i>Noland</i> Court's specific reservation of the question, 517 U.S. at 543, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118024\"><a href=\"/opinion/118024/united-states-v-noland/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1524</span></a></span>, leaves it far from clear whether the inequitable conduct requirement would apply in such circumstances. As we have said, however, that is a question for another day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The Equities.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our holding that stock redemption claims, as a class, may not automatically be subjected to equitable subordination does not end our odyssey. We therefore turn to the case-specific inquiry that the bankruptcy court failed to undertake: do the equities of this case support the equitable subordination of the appellant's stock redemption note claim? In undertaking this assessment, we begin with an explanation of the statutory mechanism underpinning the creation and use of ESOPs. An ESOP is an oddity among ERISA plans. It serves three discrete purposes: it functions as an employee retirement benefit plan, as a device for increasing a corporation's capitalization, and as a method of fostering loyalty. <i>See Lalonde v. Textron, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200996\"><a href=\"/opinion/200996/lalonde-v-textron-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">369</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 n. 7 (1st Cir.2004). Notwithstanding the fact that its focus is on investing exclusively in company stock, an ESOP is considered a \"stock bonus plan\" and, as such, must meet various regulatory benchmarks prescribed by Congress and by the Secretary of the Treasury. 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1107(d)(6)(A). The benchmarks include a mandate that an ESOP must satisfy the cash distribution requirement of section 409(h) of the Internal Revenue Code. <i>See</i> 26 U.S.C. &#167; 401(a)(23). That section provides that beneficiaries of such a plan may demand their share of employer securities upon retirement, <i>id.</i> &#167; 409(h)(1)(A), and \"if the employer securities are not readily tradable on an established market,\" a retiring employee may \"require that the employer repurchase [the] employer securities under a fair valuation formula,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 409(h)(1)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This latter choice is the put option, and its exercise is limited to a relatively brief interval following separation from service (by retirement or otherwise). <i>See id.</i> &#167; 409(h)(4). When an employer is subject to the put option (i.e., when, and only when, its stock is not readily tradable), the employer may elect to pay the repurchase price over a period not to exceed five years. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 409(h)(5)(A). Once that election is made, the employer must post adequate security. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 409(h)(5)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having limned the origins of the Note, we look next to the equities of subordinating the appellant's claim. Any case-by-case analysis of the equities of subordinating a particular claim that arises out of a stock redemption must begin with an examination of whether the underlying rationale for the <i>Keith</i> rule applies. In a pre-<i>Noland</i> case, the Seventh Circuit described that rationale as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Stock redemption] claims are, in substance, based on equity interests. When [the holders of those claims] invested in [the corporation], they positioned themselves to benefit if the company performed well, but they also accepted the risk that the company might perform poorly. Thus [they] accepted risks and benefits that . . . unsecured creditors did not, and as such their equity interests were legally subordinate to possible claims of unsecured creditors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Matter of Envirodyne Indus., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"714992\"><a href=\"/opinion/714992/in-the-matter-of-envirodyne-industries-inc-debtor-appellee-appeals-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></a></span>, 583 (7th Cir.1996). This rationale does not apply to the appellant's claim for several reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the stock redemption transaction in this case occurred within the ERISA framework. That matters because a participant in an ERISA plan does not assume the same levels of risk as a typical equity investor. Indeed, one of ERISA's principal purposes is to minimize risks to a participant's retirement benefits. <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1001(b); <i>see also Nachman Corp. v. Pension Benefit Guar. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110257\"><a href=\"/opinion/110257/nachman-corp-v-pension-benefit-guaranty-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">359</span></a></span>, 375, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110257\"><a href=\"/opinion/110257/nachman-corp-v-pension-benefit-guaranty-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1723</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110257\"><a href=\"/opinion/110257/nachman-corp-v-pension-benefit-guaranty-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">64</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">354</span></a></span> (1980) (stating that ERISA seeks to ensure that \"if a worker has been promised a defined pension benefit upon retirement &#8212; and if he has fulfilled whatever conditions are required to obtain a vested benefit &#8212; he will actually receive it\"). Thus, although the employee's position entails market risk during the period of employment (the ESOP holds the stock in trust for its participants, and so the employee is, functionally, a stockholder), ERISA seeks to eliminate that risk once retirement occurs. The ordinary repurchase by a company of its stock carries with it the implied condition that payment is contingent on the fulfillment of obligations to other creditors. <i>Cf. Robinson v. Wangemann,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1564226\"><a href=\"/opinion/1564226/robinson-v-wangemann/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">756</span></a></span>, 757-58 (5th Cir.1935) (implying the existence of such a condition). The mandates of ERISA, however &#8212; particularly its requirement that the holders of ESOP-spawned stock redemption notes be given adequate security &#8212; argue persuasively against the implication of any such condition where an ERISA-qualified ESOP is involved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add, moreover, that this Note is not (and should not be treated as) an ordinary stock redemption note because classifying it as such would elevate form over substance. ERISA's statutory scheme, taken as a whole, ensures that even though an ESOP is denominated as a \"stock ownership plan,\" it offers retirees a choice between continued stock ownership and a pecuniary retirement benefit. It gives that choice to the employee by giving him, in the first instance, an unqualified right to demand stock. If there is a ready market for the stock, the employee can convert it into cash quite easily. If, however, the employer's shares are not readily tradeable, ERISA makes certain that the ESOP provides him an equivalent mechanism for converting the stock into cash.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So it was here. When the appellant's ESOP benefits came due, he elected not to take stock ownership in the debtor, preferring instead to convert shares that were not readily tradable into cash. The debtor honored that election. It chose, however, to defer a portion of its payment obligations. By structuring the transaction to play out over time, the debtor placed the appellant in his present predicament as a noteholder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This chronology helps to explain why the appellant's claim for payment due on the Note should not be viewed in the same light as claims arising from stock redemption notes that have a more conventional genesis. The appellant's election made manifest his intention to refrain from becoming an equity investor (with all the risks attendant thereto). Under these circumstances, there is a strong policy argument that the Note should be viewed for what it is: a note received in partial payment of retirement plan benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, it is readily evident that the Note on which the appellant's claim is based did not arise from a conventional stock redemption. Thus, the underlying rationale for no-fault equitable subordination is so severely undercut as to be worthless. Here, moreover, the lower courts gave no other reason, cognizable in equity, for subordinating the appellant's claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In other circumstances, we might remand for further proceedings; after all, an individualized assessment of what a creditor did or failed to do in relation to his claim ordinarily entails questions of fact. This case, however, is one in which the nature of the appellant's conduct is undisputed. Under such circumstances, a remand would serve no useful purpose. There is no evidence of any misconduct attributable to the appellant nor does anything about his behavior offer the slightest reason for equitable subordination. We hold, therefore, that there is no equitable basis for subordinating the appellant's claim under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 510(c)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> This holding necessarily results in the reversal of the bankruptcy court's transfer of the Attachment based on section 510(c)(2), as a lien can only be transferred under that section when the underlying claim has been equitably subordinated. <i>See id.</i> 510(c)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Consistent with the Supreme Court's recent case law, we hold that bankruptcy courts may not categorically subordinate classes of claims based on generalized policy considerations. Instead, they must exercise their equitable discretion to decide whether or not to subordinate particular claims on a case-by-case basis. Given the facts of this case, we hold as a matter of law that it was improper for the bankruptcy court, in the absence of misconduct on the part of the note holder or any other special circumstance, to impose equitable subordination on a claim that arises from a promissory note received in connection with the deferred payment of retirement benefits under an ERISA-qualified ESOP. Accordingly, the decisions below must be reversed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>We reverse the order of the district court equitably subordinating the appellant's claim and transferring the Attachment, remand the case to the district court, and direct that court to remand the case to the bankruptcy court with such instructions as may be necessary to carry out our holding.
