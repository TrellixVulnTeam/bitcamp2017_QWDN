Hahn and Hahn & Matkov on brief for petitioner.\n     Corey L. Farrell, Office of Immigration Litigation, Peter D.\nKeisler, Assistant Attorney General, and Terri J. Scadron,\nAssistant Director, on motion for summary affirmance.\n\n\n\n                           November 5, 2008\n\f            Per Curiam. At issue in this immigration case is whether\n\na Rhode Island conviction for simple assault is a \"crime of\n\nviolence\" under 18 U.S.C. § 16 and is thus an \"aggravated felony\"\n\nunder 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(F). In an unrelated case, we recently\n\nanswered this question in the affirmative.         See Lopes v. Keisler,\n\n505 F.3d 58 (1st Cir. 2007).        Finding Lopes dispositive, we grant\n\nrespondent's motion for summary affirmance and deny the petition\n\nfor review.\n\n            Petitioner has been found removable based on his 2005\n\nconviction for misdemeanor assault under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-5-3.\n\nThat enactment, entitled \"Simple assault or battery,\" provides that\n\n\"every person who shall make an assault or battery or both shall be\n\nimprisoned not exceeding one year or fined.\"           Id. § 11-5-3(a).     As\n\nreported in the criminal complaint and docket sheet, petitioner\n\npled guilty to the charge of assaulting a police officer (and to a\n\nsecond, related charge) and received a one-year suspended sentence.\n\nAccording to respondent, that conviction for simple assault is a\n\ncrime of violence and thus an aggravated felony, which renders him\n\nineligible for discretionary relief.\n\n            Three statutory provisions are implicated.            \"Any alien\n\nwho   is   convicted   of   an   aggravated   felony   at   any   time   after\n\nadmission is deportable.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). The term\n\n\"aggravated felony\" includes \"a crime of violence (as defined in\n\nsection 16 of Title 18 ...) for which the term of imprisonment [is]\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fat least one year.\"    Id. § 1101(a)(43)(F).   And the term \"crime of\n\nviolence\" means\n\n                (a) an offense that has as an element the\n           use, attempted use, or threatened use of\n           physical force against the person or property\n           of another, or\n                (b) any other offense that is a felony\n           and   that,   by  its   nature,   involves   a\n           substantial risk that physical force against\n           the person or property of another may be used\n           in the course of committing the offense.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 16.       Because petitioner's assault conviction is a\n\nmisdemeanor (under both state and federal law), § 16(b) is not at\n\nissue here.   Accordingly, the question is whether use of physical\n\nforce is an \"element\" of Rhode Island simple assault--i.e., \"a\n\nconstituent part of the offense which must be proved by the\n\nprosecution in every case to sustain a conviction.\"         Singh v.\n\nAshcroft, 386 F.3d 1228, 1231 (9th Cir. 2004) (internal quotation\n\nmarks and emphasis deleted).\n\n           As explained in State v. Jeremiah, 546 A.2d 183, 186\n\n(R.I. 1988), the \"standard definition of criminal assault\" in Rhode\n\nIsland is set forth in State v. Baker, 38 A. 653 (R.I. 1897), as\n\nfollows:\n\n           An assault, as ordinarily defined, is any\n           unlawful attempt or offer with force or\n           violence to do a corporal hurt to another,\n           whether from malice or wantonness.         The\n           offense may consist also in putting another in\n           fear of violence.\n\nId. at 654 (emphasis added); accord, e.g., State v. Coningford, 901\n\nA.2d 623, 630 (R.I. 2006); State v. McLaughlin, 621 A.2d 170, 177\n\n                                 -3-\n\f(R.I.       1993).1    Relying   on   the   emphasized   portions   of   this\n\ndefinition, we concluded in Lopes that under Rhode Island law\n\n\"there can be no assault without the presence of physical force.\"\n\n505 F.3d at 63.       We thus held that a conviction for simple assault\n\nunder § 11-5-3 \"satisfies the statutory definition of a crime of\n\nviolence because it has as an element the 'attempted use, or\n\nthreatened use of physical force against the person or property of\n\nanother.'\" Id.        (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 16(a)).2\n\n               Petitioner's attempts to challenge or distinguish the\n\nreasoning in Lopes fall short.          His main argument is that simple\n\nassault in Rhode Island can include \"reckless\" conduct--which,\n\nunder the case law applying Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U.S. 1 (2004),\n\nis a mens rea that does not satisfy the \"use of physical force\"\n\nrequirement in 18 U.S.C. § 16.        See, e.g., United States v. Zuniga-\n\nSoto, 527 F.3d 1110, 1123-24 (10th Cir. 2008).               We rejected a\n\n\n\n        1\n        Battery is a separate offense. It \"refers to an act that\nwas intended to cause, and does cause, an offensive contact with or\nunconsented touching of or trauma upon the body of another, thereby\ngenerally resulting in the consummation of the assault.\"\nConingford, 901 A.2d at 630 (internal quotation marks omitted);\naccord, e.g., State v. Davis, 384 A.2d 1061, 1064 (R.I. 1978)\n(\"battery ... is the intentional and unlawful application of the\nslightest force to the person of another\").\n        2\n        The alien in Lopes was convicted under both § 11-5-3 and\nthe state's Domestic Violence Prevention Act, R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-\n29-5. The latter is not a separate offense, but rather imposes\nenhanced penalties for assault (and related crimes) when committed\nagainst family or household members. That § 12-29-5 was involved\nin Lopes does not affect the analysis of whether simple assault\nconstitutes a crime of violence.\n\n                                      -4-\n\fLeocal-based      argument   in     Lopes,       albeit       without        addressing\n\nrecklessness.      See 505 F.3d at 63.            In any event, petitioner's\n\nexpansive definition of assault proves mistaken.                   He relies solely\n\non the 1897 Baker decision and two references contained therein to\n\nrecklessness.     See 38 A. at 654.       Yet the court did not there hold,\n\nand has not since held, that reckless as opposed to intentional\n\nconduct could suffice for an assault conviction; to the contrary,\n\nit noted that \"[t]here must be an intent to commit an assault, or\n\nelse there can be no assault.\"               Id. at 653 (quoting jury charge\n\nwith approval).         Moreover, petitioner's view is at odds with\n\ngeneral descriptions of the common law.                      See, e.g., Popal v.\n\nGonzales, 416 F.3d 249, 255 n.5 (3d Cir. 2005) (\"The common law ...\n\nrequired 'willfulness,' i.e., intent, in order to find a defendant\n\nguilty   of    simple   assault.\");      2     Wayne    R.    LaFave,    Substantive\n\nCriminal Law, § 16.3, at 566 & 569 (2d ed. 2003 & '08 Supp.)\n\n(explaining     that    recklessness      does    not    suffice        to   establish\n\nassault).\n\n              To be sure, some statutory \"assault\" provisions contain\n\na recklessness element. See, e.g., Fernandez-Ruiz v. Gonzales, 466\n\nF.3d 1121, 1125 (9th Cir. 2006) (en banc).               Yet these are actually\n\n\"battery-type statutes.\"         See 2 LaFave, supra, § 16.2(c), at 557\n\n(\"In the modern codes, a substantial majority of the battery-type\n\nstatutes    expressly    state    that    the    crime       may   be   committed   by\n\nrecklessness--that is, where there is subjective awareness of the\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fhigh risk of physical injury.\") (footnotes omitted).            And just as\n\nin Lopes, see 505 F.3d at 62, it is clear that petitioner here was\n\nconvicted of assault rather than battery.3\n\n           Petitioner   also   alleges   that   the   assault    definition\n\napplied by Lopes was drawn from cases involving offenses more\n\nserious than simple assault.      See, e.g., McLaughlin, 621 A.2d at\n\n177 (misdemeanor manslaughter); Baker, 38 A. at 653 (assault with\n\na dangerous weapon).     Yet nothing more than simple assault was\n\ninvolved in State v. Tabele, 621 A.2d 185 (R.I. 1993), which\n\nenunciated a similar definition.         In a related vein, petitioner\n\ninsists that Congress never intended that the term \"crime of\n\nviolence\" would encompass such a relatively insignificant offense.\n\nYet the legislative history contains a specific reference to simple\n\nassault suggesting otherwise.      See, e.g., Popal, 416 F.3d at 254\n\nn.5.\n\n           The motion for summary affirmance is granted, and the\n\npetition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n         For example, petitioner never objected to the BIA's\nobservation that \"[w]hile [§ 11-5-3(a)] proscribes the commission\nof both simple assault and battery, the parties appear to agree\nthat [petitioner] was only convicted of simple assault.\"      As a\nresult, petitioner's reliance on cases such as Chrzanoski v.\nAshcroft, 327 F.3d 188 (2d Cir. 2003), and United States v. Bayes,\n210 F.3d 64 (1st Cir. 2000), is misplaced.        The offense in\nChrzanoski, for example, although denominated as \"third degree\nassault,\" required a showing of physical injury and thus was in\nfact a form of battery.\n\n                                  -6-\n\f",

Yet the court did not there hold,\n\nand has not since held, that reckless as opposed to intentional\n\nconduct could suffice for an assault conviction; to the contrary,\n\nit noted that \"[t]here must be an intent to commit an assault, or\n\nelse there can be no assault.\"               Id. at 653 (quoting jury charge\n\nwith approval).         Moreover, petitioner's view is at odds with\n\ngeneral descriptions of the common law.                      See, e.g., Popal v.\n\nGonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791142\"><a href=\"/opinion/791142/nazir-ahmad-popal-v-alberto-gonzales-attorney-general-of-the-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">249</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 255 n.5 (3d Cir. 2005) (\"The common law ...\n\nrequired 'willfulness,' i.e., intent, in order to find a defendant\n\nguilty   of    simple   assault.\");      2     Wayne    R.    LaFave,    Substantive\n\nCriminal Law, § 16.3, at 566 & 569 (2d ed. 2003 & '08 Supp.)\n\n(explaining     that    recklessness      does    not    suffice        to   establish\n\nassault).\n\n              To be sure, some statutory \"assault\" provisions contain\n\na recklessness element. See, e.g., Fernandez-Ruiz v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1121</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1125 (9th Cir. 2006) (en banc).               Yet these are actually\n\n\"battery-type statutes.\"         See 2 LaFave, supra, § 16.2(c), at 557\n\n(\"In the modern codes, a substantial majority of the battery-type\n\nstatutes    expressly    state    that    the    crime       may   be   committed   by\n\nrecklessness--that is, where there is subjective awareness of the\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fhigh risk of physical injury.\") (footnotes omitted).            And just as\n\nin Lopes, see 505 F.3d at 62, it is clear that petitioner here was\n\nconvicted of assault rather than battery.3\n\n           Petitioner   also   alleges   that   the   assault    definition\n\napplied by Lopes was drawn from cases involving offenses more\n\nserious than simple assault.      See, e.g., McLaughlin, 621 A.2d at\n\n177 (misdemeanor manslaughter); Baker, 38 A. at 653 (assault with\n\na dangerous weapon).     Yet nothing more than simple assault was\n\ninvolved in State v. Tabele, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">621</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">185</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (R.I. 1993), which\n\nenunciated a similar definition.         In a related vein, petitioner\n\ninsists that Congress never intended that the term \"crime of\n\nviolence\" would encompass such a relatively insignificant offense.\n\nYet the legislative history contains a specific reference to simple\n\nassault suggesting otherwise.      See, e.g., Popal, 416 F.3d at 254\n\nn.5.\n\n           The motion for summary affirmance is granted, and the\n\npetition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n         For example, petitioner never objected to the BIA's\nobservation that \"[w]hile [§ 11-5-3(a)] proscribes the commission\nof both simple assault and battery, the parties appear to agree\nthat [petitioner] was only convicted of simple assault.\"      As a\nresult, petitioner's reliance on cases such as Chrzanoski v.\nAshcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781724\"><a href=\"/opinion/781724/jaroslaw-chrzanoski-1-v-john-ashcroft-us-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">327</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">188</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d Cir. 2003), and United States v.

The offense in\nChrzanoski, for example, although denominated as \"third degree\nassault,\" required a showing of physical injury and thus was in\nfact a form of battery.\n\n                                  -6-\n\f</pre>",
