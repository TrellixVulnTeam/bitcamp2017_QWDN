R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                       For the First Circuit\n\n\nNo. 04-2078\n\n                             UNITED STATES,\n\n                                Appellee,\n\n                                     v.\n\n                            STEVEN A.

Barbadoro,          U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                    Torruella, Lynch and Lipez,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Steven A. Swan on brief pro se.\n     Thomas P. Colantuono, United States Attorney, and William E.\nMorse, Assistant U.S. Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                              July 6, 2006\n\f            Per Curiam. After carefully considering the briefs and\n\nrecord on appeal, we affirm the judgment below.\n\n            The   appellant   argues   that    the   government   failed   to\n\nproduce sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable jury to conclude\n\nthat he acted willfully.        A willful violation is a voluntary,\n\nintentional relinquishment of a known legal duty.          Cheek v. United\n\nStates, 498 U.S. 192 (1991).       An error arising from a bona fide\n\nmisunderstanding of the Tax Code is not willful, but an error\n\narising    from   a   constitutional   or     philosophical   objection    is\n\nwillful.   Cheek, 498 U.S. at 205-206.        The appellant argues that he\n\nsincerely believed that the Tax Code was unconstitutional. This is\n\njust the sort of argument that Cheek precludes.           United States v.\n\nBonneau, 970 F.2d 929 (1st Cir. 1992).          In any event, he makes no\n\nshowing that a reasonable jury could not have found that he knew\n\nhis tax obligations and intentionally renounced them.                United\n\nStates v. Campbell, 268 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n            The appellant also argues that the court should have\n\ndismissed the charges on the ground of selective prosecution.              He\n\nshows no error.       To prevail on a selective prosecution claim, he\n\nwould have to show, inter alia, that he was singled out for\n\nprosecution for impermissible reasons.           United States v. Graham,\n\n146 F.3d 6 (1st Cir. 1998).     Minimally, his criminal investigation\n\n\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fbegan before the speech that he alleged triggered his prosecution.\n\nUnited States v. Serafino, 281 F.3d 327 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n           Finally,       the   appellant    fails   to    show   that     his   tax\n\nliabilities   violate      the    Sixteenth    Amendment.         The    amendment\n\neliminated apportionment. Quijano v. United States, 93 F.3d 26 (1st\n\nCir. 1996).   The appellant points to nothing in its plain language\n\nor other law that supports his position.             Edwards v. Cuba R. Co.,\n\n268 U.S. 628 (1925).\n\n           The     appellant’s     remaining    arguments     are       either   not\n\nproperly before us or insufficiently developed.                In the light of\n\nthis   decision,    the    appellant’s      remaining     pending   motions      are\n\ndenied.\n\n           Affirmed. 1st Cir. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f",
