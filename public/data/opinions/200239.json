José Antonio Fusté, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n              Coffin and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Nicolas Nogueras on brief for appellants.\n     Roberto J. Sánchez Ramos, Solicitor General, Vanessa Lugo\nFlores, Deputy Solicitor General, and Jaime Mercado-Almodóvar,\nAssistant Solicitor General, on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n                        December 10, 2002\n\f             SELYA, Circuit Judge.         This appeal arises out of an\n\nunsuccessful suit by plaintiff-appellant Bethzaida Cintrón-Lorenzo\n\n(Cintrón)     against    her   former      employer,     defendant-appellee\n\nDepartamento de Asuntos del Consumidor (DACO).1 Before us, Cintrón\n\nchallenges both the district court's order dismissing her case for\n\nwant of diligent prosecution and its sequential order denying her\n\nmotion for reconsideration.        For the reasons elucidated below, we\n\nreject her appeal.\n\n             The subsidiary facts are fairly straightforward (although\n\nthe record is ragged and the briefs confuse certain of the dates).\n\nDACO hired    Cintrón as an attorney in or around 1997.             The working\n\nrelationship did not go smoothly.           As a result, Cintrón filed a\n\nmultifaceted claim of discrimination with the Equal Employment\n\nOpportunity Commission (EEOC) during the year 2000.                    In that\n\ndocument    she   charged   DACO   with    violating   the   Americans    with\n\nDisabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213, by refusing to\n\naccommodate       her   physical    disability,    and       with    political\n\ndiscrimination based upon her support of the Popular Democratic\n\nParty.     In due course, the EEOC issued a right-to-sue letter.\n\n\n     1\n      Cintrón's parents and niece also appear as plaintiffs and\nappellants. Because their claims are purely derivative, we treat\nthe case as if Cintrón was the sole plaintiff and appellant. By\nthe same token, Cintrón sued not only DACO (an agency of the Puerto\nRican government) but also several public officials, including\nAngel E. Rotger-Sabat, José A. Alicea-Rivera, José M. Cintrón-\nGarcía, Zenaida García-Villegas, Gladys E. Méndez-Hernández,\nGerardo R. Picó-Del Rosario, and Elvia M. Camayd-Vélez. We refer\nto the defendants, collectively, as DACO.\n\n                                     -2-\n\f          On August 15, 2000, Cintrón, armed with the right-to-sue\n\nletter, filed a pro se complaint in the federal district court.\n\nShe again claimed that DACO had violated both the ADA and her right\n\nto free political association under the First Amendment.          For good\n\nmeasure, she also alleged, inter alia, violations of the Fifth and\n\nFourteenth Amendments; 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1985; various sections\n\nof the Puerto Rico Constitution; and a potpourri of local laws.        In\n\nan amended complaint, filed as a matter of right, see Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 15(a), she added a Rehabilitation Act claim under 29 U.S.C. §\n\n794.\n\n          On   November   29,   2000,   the   district   court,    citing\n\nCintrón's failure to seek the issuance and service of summonses,\n\nordered her to show cause why her case should not be dismissed for\n\nlack of diligent prosecution.    See Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m) (requiring\n\nservice within 120 days from the filing of a complaint). The\n\ncourt's order was entered on the docket on December 4, 2000, and,\n\nshortly thereafter, Cintrón served the defendants.       She also filed\n\na written rejoinder in which she stated that difficulties in trying\n\nto obtain legal representation had led to the delay. She indicated\n\nthat she would need an additional forty-five to sixty days to\n\nretain counsel.   The court did not respond but, by not pressing the\n\nmatter, effectively granted her the desired grace period.\n\n          On February 16, 2001, Cintrón requested a further sixty-\n\nday extension in order to procure legal representation. Four days\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\flater, DACO served the plaintiff with a motion to dismiss the\n\naction for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state\n\na claim.2   On March 15, 2001, DACO gave notice that it had served\n\nthe plaintiff with a supplementary motion to dismiss.          Cintrón did\n\nnot respond to either of these filings.\n\n            In April of 2001, the further sixty-day extension sought\n\nin   Cintrón's   February   16   motion   expired   without   an   entry   of\n\nappearance on her behalf.        She remained mute.     On June 4, 2001,\n\nDACO filed yet a third motion to dismiss, but Cintrón again\n\nneglected to reply.\n\n            On June 21, 2001, the district court advised Cintrón that\n\nit would give her until July 2, 2001 to retain counsel and/or\n\nanswer the pending motions.      In that order, the court noted that it\n\nhad, in effect, given Cintrón extra time; and that the extensions\n\nshe had sought had \"long elapsed.\"          The court explicitly warned\n\nCintrón that \"[t]his [the grace period lasting through July 2,\n\n2001] is the last extension before considering dismissing the case\n\nfor lack of diligent prosecution.\"          The court's admonition went\n\nunheeded: Cintrón did nothing, and, on July 16, 2001, the district\n\ncourt, true to its word, dismissed the case under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n41(b) for lack of prosecution.\n\n\n      2\n      Alternatively, DACO sought a stay of proceedings pending the\nSupreme Court's decision in a case then under consideration. That\ncase has since been decided. See Board of Trustees of Univ. of\nAla. v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356 (2001).       The stay request is,\ntherefore, moot.\n\n                                    -4-\n\f                 On    July   27,   2001,   an    attorney    filed       an    entry    of\n\nappearance            on   Cintrón's   behalf,     along     with     a    motion       for\n\nreconsideration.3             The court summarily denied the motion.                 This\n\nappeal followed.\n\n                 We turn first to the district court's dismissal of the\n\ncase for want of diligent prosecution. Cintrón's basic argument is\n\nthat       she    was      suffering   from       many   afflictions           (physical,\n\npsychological, and emotional) during the spring of 2001.                            These\n\nculminated in the performance of a biopsy on June 8, followed by a\n\ncancer diagnosis two weeks later.                 The problem, however, is that\n\nshe failed to bring any of these travails to the attention of the\n\ndistrict court in a timeous fashion.                Instead, Cintrón dawdled for\n\nupwards of seven months; her only meaningful response during that\n\nperiod was a filing, early on, that attributed her dilatoriness to\n\n\n\n       3\n      Cintrón's counsel styled this motion as a motion for relief\nfrom judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) and contended that the\ndistrict court should set aside its earlier order based upon\nexcusable neglect. That creates an immediate problem for Cintrón,\nas a Rule 60(b) motion does not toll the running of the appeal\nperiod on the original judgment (and, therefore, an appeal from the\ndenial of such a motion does not bring the merits of the underlying\njudgment up for review). See Karak v. Bursaw Oil Corp., 288 F.3d\n15, 18-19 (1st Cir. 2002); Rodriguez-Antuna v. Chase Manhattan Bank\nCorp., 871 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1989). Here, however, Cintrón's\nmotion was filed within ten days of the entry of the district\ncourt's original judgment. Since we are not bound by a party's\nchoice of label, we elect, favorably to Cintrón, to consider the\nmotion as a motion to alter or amend the judgment under Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 59(e). See Lopez v. Corporación Azucarera de P.R., 938\nF.2d 1510, 1513-14 (1st Cir. 1991); Silk v. Sandoval, 435 F.2d\n1266, 1267-68 (1st Cir. 1971). This enables us to reach the merits\nof the original order of dismissal.\n\n                                            -5-\n\fdifficulty in securing the services of outside counsel.                In that\n\nfiling, she asked for an additional sixty days within which to\n\nretain counsel.          But that period — like the initial forty-five-to-\n\nsixty-day period that she had specified — came and went without the\n\nachievement of any noticeable progress.               During and after that\n\ninterval, she neither secured counsel, nor answered the several\n\npending motions, nor apprised the court of a need for more time,\n\nnor revealed that her efforts were hampered by medical problems.\n\n                  Against this backdrop, the order of dismissal cannot be\n\nfaulted.4          A district court, as part of its inherent power to\n\nmanage its own docket, may dismiss a case sua sponte for any of the\n\nreasons prescribed in Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b).              E.g., Link v. Wabash\n\nR.R.       Co.,    370   U.S.   626,   629-31   (1962).    Lack   of   diligent\n\nprosecution is such a reason.               Id. at 630-31.     We review the\n\ndistrict court's dismissal of a case for want of prosecution only\n\nfor abuse of discretion.          Id. at 633; Tower Ventures, Inc. v. City\n\nof Westfield, 296 F.3d 43, 46 (1st Cir. 2002).             In undertaking that\n\nreview, we consider all pertinent circumstances and balance the\n\nauthority of the court to prevent undue delay against the policy of\n\n\n\n       4\n      We analyze this issue in terms of Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b) and\nthe district court's inherent case-management powers.            In\nundertaking this task, we note that the plaintiff has not developed\nany argument based upon the district court's local rule governing\ndismissals for lack of prosecution, D.P.R.R. 313.1, and, thus, we\ndo not consider that rule. See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d\n1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (explaining that issues not squarely raised\non appeal are deemed abandoned).\n\n                                         -6-\n\fthe law favoring the disposition of cases on the merits.                          See HMG\n\nProp. Investors, Inc. v. Parque Indus. Rio Canas, Inc., 847 F.2d\n\n908, 917 (1st Cir. 1988); Richman v. Gen. Motors Corp., 437 F.2d\n\n196, 199 (1st Cir. 1971).           We remain mindful, however, that courts\n\n— especially trial courts — \"must be given considerable leeway in\n\nexercising     their      admitted    authority          to    punish    laggardly    or\n\nnoncompliant litigants.\"            Batiz Chamorro v. P.R. Cars, Inc., 304\n\nF.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n             Here, the court exhibited extraordinary patience. First,\n\nit warned Cintrón, as early as December of 2000, that she was\n\nrisking dismissal for lack of prosecution.                     Second, when Cintrón\n\nrequested up to sixty days to put her case back on track, the court\n\ngave her that indulgence.           Third, when she sought a further sixty-\n\nday period within which to regroup, the court again indulged her\n\n(and, indeed, effectively gave her twice that amount of time).\n\nEven at that juncture, the court did not dismiss the action\n\noutright, but, rather, issued another warning and allowed Cintrón\n\na further opportunity to make amends.                         Cintrón rewarded this\n\nmagnanimity by stonewalling: she never communicated with the court\n\nin an effort either to explain her personal situation or to shed\n\nlight   on    what        efforts    she     was     making       to    obtain     legal\n\nrepresentation.        In the end, the court was faced with Cintrón's\n\nprotracted — and largely unexplained — noncompliance with time\n\nlimits imposed       by    standing    rules       and    specific      orders.      This\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\fprotracted noncompliance, in the teeth of explicit warnings, amply\n\njustified a termination of the action.     See Top Entertainment Inc.\n\nv. Ortega, 285 F.3d 115, 118-19 (1st Cir. 2002); Figueroa Ruiz v.\n\nAlegria, 896 F.2d 645, 648 (1st Cir. 1990); cf. Tower Ventures, 296\n\nF.3d at 46 (explaining that \"disobedience of court orders, in and\n\nof itself, constitutes extreme misconduct (and, thus, warrants\n\ndismissal)\").\n\n          We think it is particularly noteworthy that Cintrón\n\nrequested successive extensions of time within which to retain\n\ncounsel, thus impliedly promising compliance by the end of that\n\naggregate period.    As we have said, \"[w]hen a litigant seeks an\n\nextension of time and proposes a compliance date, the court is\n\nentitled to expect that the litigant will meet its self-imposed\n\ndeadline.\"   Tower Ventures, 296 F.3d at 47.       Cintrón's failure to\n\nachieve the time line that she herself had suggested weighs heavily\n\nagainst   her.      See   id.   (holding   that,   absent   \"excusatory\n\ncircumstances,\" a litigant's failure to adhere to such a deadline\n\n\"warrants an inference of deliberate manipulation\").\n\n          Cintrón's argument that pro se plaintiffs deserve greater\n\nleniency strikes us as disingenuous.       There are, of course, some\n\nsettings in which such leniency is appropriate.       See, e.g., Haines\n\nv. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520-21 (1972) (per curiam); Instituto de\n\nEducacion Universal Corp. v. United States Dep't of Educ., 209 F.3d\n\n18, 23-24 (1st Cir. 2000).      Here, however, the district court's\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fintentions were plain; it issued two explicit warnings. Equally as\n\nimportant, Cintrón herself is an attorney (albeit not a member of\n\nthe   federal   bar)   who   should    have    been       well   aware   of   the\n\nconsequences of a dogged failure to comply with court orders.                  At\n\nthe very least, Cintrón could — and should — have notified the\n\ncourt both of her inability to comply and of the reasons for that\n\nnoncompliance.     Having been warned twice that noncompliance could\n\nresult in dismissal, she maintained a stoic silence at her peril.\n\n           We turn next to Cintrón's motion for reconsideration.\n\nHowever that motion is characterized, see supra note 3, we review\n\nthe district court's disposition of it for abuse of discretion.\n\nSee   Teamsters,   Chauffeurs,   Warehousemen         &    Helpers   Union     v.\n\nSuperline Transp. Co., 953 F.2d 17, 19 (1st Cir. 1992) (explicating\n\nstandard of review referable to Rule 60(b) motions); Appeal of Sun\n\nPipe Line Co., 831 F.2d 22, 24-25 (1st Cir. 1987) (explicating\n\nstandard of review referable to Rule 59(e) motions). We discern no\n\nabuse of the trial court's discretion here.\n\n           For convenience, we use the Rule 60(b) standard (although\n\nthe outcome would be the same under the jurisprudence of Rule\n\n59(e)). We have made it transparently clear that relief under Rule\n\n60(b) \"is extraordinary in nature.\" Karak v. Bursaw Oil Corp., 288\n\nF.3d 15, 19 (1st Cir. 2002).     Accordingly, \"motions invoking that\n\nrule should be granted sparingly.\"            Id.     In considering such a\n\nmotion, we recognize the district court's \"intimate, first-hand\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fknowledge of the case,\" and, thus, defer broadly to that court's\n\ninformed discretion.             Id.\n\n                Cintrón claims that her failure to prosecute was the\n\nresult of excusable neglect (and, therefore, should have been\n\nforgiven).        She identifies her personal problems and her inability\n\nto retain counsel as exceptional circumstances justifying relief\n\nfrom judgment.          We reject this proffer.          The determination of what\n\nconstitutes excusable neglect in a given case requires that the\n\ncourt      take      into    account    the   totality       of    the    circumstances\n\nsurrounding the movant's omissions.                    Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v.\n\nBrunswick Assocs. Ltd. P'ship, 507 U.S. 380, 395 (1993); Dávila-\n\nÁlvarez v. Escuela de Medicina, 257 F.3d 58, 64 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n                At a bare minimum, a party who seeks relief from judgment\n\non   the    basis       of   excusable    neglect       must      offer   a   convincing\n\nexplanation as to why the neglect was excusable.                      Graphic Comm'ns\n\nInt'l Union v. Quebecor Printing Prov., Inc., 270 F.3d 1, 5 (1st\n\nCir. 2001); Hosp. del Maestro v. NLRB, 263 F.3d 173, 175 (1st Cir.\n\n2001) (per curiam).              Cintrón has not carried this burden:                 the\n\nlength     of     the   delay     was   inordinate      in     this   case;    Cintrón's\n\ncondition varied over time; and even if her ailments interfered to\n\nsome extent with her ability to secure counsel — a matter on which\n\nwe   take       no   view    —   she    offers    no    credible      excuse    for   not\n\ncommunicating her plight to the district court in a timely fashion.\n\nWhen a litigant (especially a litigant who is trained as a lawyer)\n\n\n                                           -10-\n\felects to file a suit pro se, her duty of attending to the case is\n\nnot    automatically   excused   by    personal    tragedy      or    emotional\n\nupheaval.\n\n             The plaintiff's failure to communicate with the court\n\nbrings this point into sharp focus.         As we explained two decades\n\nago, a party's \"first obligation is to make every effort to comply\n\nwith   the   court's   order.    The    second    is   to    seek    consent   if\n\ncompliance is, in fact, impossible.       And the third is to seek court\n\napproval for noncompliance based on a truly valid reason.\" Damiani\n\nv. R.I. Hosp., 704 F.2d 12, 17 (1st Cir. 1983).             Cintrón blatantly\n\nviolated this code of conduct:        among other things, she failed not\n\nonly to inform the district court of her alleged impairments but\n\nalso to seek judicial approval for her repeated noncompliance with\n\nprocedural rules, court orders, and a series of deadlines.                 Even\n\ntaking her description of her afflictions at face value, nothing\n\nabout them excuses this persistent failure to communicate.               Giving\n\ndue weight to all of the circumstances surrounding Cintrón's\n\nextensive neglect, we would be hard pressed to find it excusable.\n\nA fortiori, we cannot find that the district court's denial of her\n\nmotion for relief from judgment was an abuse of discretion.\n\n             That ends this aspect of the matter.

For the reasons elucidated below, we reject her appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The subsidiary facts are fairly straightforward (although the record is ragged and the briefs confuse certain of the dates). DACO hired Cintr&#243;n as an attorney in or around 1997. The working relationship did not go smoothly. As a result, Cintr&#243;n filed a multifaceted claim of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) during the year 2000. In that document she charged DACO with violating the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 12101-12213, by refusing to accommodate her physical disability, and with political discrimination based upon her support of the Popular Democratic Party. In due course, the EEOC issued a right-to-sue letter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 15, 2000, Cintr&#243;n, armed with the right-to-sue letter, filed a pro se complaint in the federal district court. She again claimed that DACO had violated both the ADA and her right to free political association under the First Amendment. For good measure, she also alleged, inter alia, violations of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments; 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1983 and 1985; various sections of the Puerto Rico Constitution; and a potpourri of local laws. In an amended complaint, filed as a matter of right, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a), she added a Rehabilitation Act claim under 29 U.S.C. &#167; 794.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 29, 2000, the district court, citing Cintr&#243;n's failure to seek the issuance and service of summonses, ordered her to show cause why her case should not be dismissed for lack of diligent prosecution. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(m) (requiring service within 120 days from the filing of a complaint). The court's order was entered on the docket on December 4, 2000, and, shortly thereafter, Cintr&#243;n served the defendants. She also filed a written rejoinder in which she stated that difficulties in trying to obtain legal representation had led to the delay. She indicated that she would need an additional forty-five to sixty days to retain counsel. The court did not respond but, by not pressing the matter, effectively granted her the desired grace period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 16, 2001, Cintr&#243;n requested a further sixty-day extension in order to procure legal representation. Four days later, DACO served the plaintiff with a motion to dismiss the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> On March 15, 2001, DACO gave notice that it had served the plaintiff with a supplementary motion to dismiss. Cintr&#243;n did not respond to either of these filings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April of 2001, the further sixty-day extension sought in Cintr&#243;n's February 16 motion expired without an entry of appearance on her behalf. She remained mute. On June 4, 2001, DACO filed yet a third motion to dismiss, but Cintr&#243;n again neglected to reply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 21, 2001, the district court advised Cintr&#243;n that it would give her until July 2, 2001 to retain counsel and/or answer the pending motions. In that order, the court noted that it had, in effect, given Cintr&#243;n extra time; and that the extensions she had sought had \"long elapsed.\" The court explicitly warned Cintr&#243;n that \"[t]his [the grace period lasting through July 2, 2001] is the last extension before considering dismissing the case for lack of diligent prosecution.\" The court's admonition went unheeded: Cintr&#243;n did nothing, and, on July 16, 2001, the district court, true to its word, dismissed the case under Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b) for lack of prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 27, 2001, an attorney filed an entry of appearance on Cintr&#243;n's behalf, along with a motion for reconsideration.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The court summarily denied the motion. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn first to the district court's dismissal of the case for want of diligent prosecution. Cintr&#243;n's basic argument is that she was suffering from many afflictions (physical, psychological, and emotional) during the spring of 2001. These culminated in the performance of a biopsy on June 8, followed by a cancer diagnosis two weeks later. The problem, however, is that she failed to bring any of these travails to the attention of the district court in a timeous fashion. Instead, Cintr&#243;n dawdled for upwards of seven months; her only meaningful response during that period was a filing, early on, that attributed her dilatoriness to difficulty in securing the services of outside counsel. In that filing, she asked for an additional sixty days within which to retain counsel. But that period &#8212; like the initial forty-five-to-sixty-day period that she had specified &#8212; came and went without the achievement of any noticeable progress. During and after that interval, she neither secured counsel, nor answered the several pending motions, nor apprised the court of a need for more time, nor revealed that her efforts were hampered by medical problems.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, the order of dismissal cannot be faulted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> A district court, as part of its inherent power to manage its own docket, may dismiss a case sua sponte for any of the reasons prescribed in Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b). <i>E.g., Link v. Wabash R.R. Co.,</i> 370 U.S. 626, 629-31, 82 S.Ct. 1386, 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1962). Lack of diligent prosecution is such a reason. <i>Id.</i> at 630-31, 82 S.Ct. 1386. We review the district court's dismissal of a case for want of prosecution only for abuse of discretion. <i>Id.</i> at 633, 82 S.Ct. 1386; <i>Tower Ventures, Inc. v. City of Westfield,</i> 296 F.3d 43, 46 (1st Cir.2002). In undertaking that review, we consider all pertinent circumstances and balance the authority of the court to prevent undue delay against the policy of the law favoring the disposition of cases on the merits. <i>See HMG Prop. Investors, Inc. v. Parque Indus. Rio Canas, Inc.,</i> 847 F.2d 908, 917 (1st Cir.1988); <i>Richman v. Gen. Motors Corp.,</i> 437 F.2d 196, 199 (1st Cir.1971). We remain mindful, however, that courts &#8212; especially trial courts&#8212;\"must be given considerable leeway in exercising their admitted authority to punish laggardly or noncompliant litigants.\" <i>Batiz Chamorro v. P.R. Cars, Inc.,</i> 304 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the court exhibited extraordinary patience. First, it warned Cintr&#243;n, as early as December of 2000, that she was risking dismissal for lack of prosecution. Second, when Cintr&#243;n requested up to sixty days to put her case back on track, the court gave her that indulgence. Third, when she sought a further sixty-day period within which to regroup, the court again indulged her (and, indeed, effectively gave her twice that amount of time). Even at that juncture, the court did not dismiss the action outright, but, rather, issued another warning and allowed Cintr&#243;n a further opportunity to make amends. Cintr&#243;n rewarded this magnanimity by stonewalling: she never communicated with the court in an effort either to explain her personal situation or to shed light on what efforts she was making to obtain legal representation. In the end, the court was faced with Cintr&#243;n's protracted &#8212; and largely unexplained &#8212; noncompliance with time limits imposed by standing rules and specific orders. This protracted noncompliance, in the teeth of explicit warnings, amply justified a termination of the action. <i>See Top Entertainment Inc. v. Ortega,</i> 285 F.3d 115, 118-19 (1st Cir.2002); <i>Figueroa Ruiz v. Alegria,</i> 896 F.2d 645, 648 (1st Cir.1990); <i>cf. Tower Ventures,</i> 296 F.3d at 46 (explaining that \"disobedience of court orders, in and of itself, constitutes extreme misconduct (and, thus, warrants dismissal)\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it is particularly noteworthy that Cintr&#243;n requested successive extensions of time within which to retain counsel, thus impliedly promising compliance by the end of that aggregate period. As we have said, \"[w]hen a litigant seeks an extension of time and proposes a compliance date, the court is entitled to expect that the litigant will meet its self-imposed deadline.\" <i>Tower Ventures,</i> 296 F.3d at 47. Cintr&#243;n's failure to achieve the time line that she herself had suggested weighs heavily against her. <i>See id.</i> (holding that, absent \"excusatory circumstances,\" a litigant's failure to adhere to such a deadline \"warrants an inference of deliberate manipulation\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cintr&#243;n's argument that pro se plaintiffs deserve greater leniency strikes us as disingenuous. There are, of course, some settings in which such leniency is appropriate. <i>See, e.g., Haines v. Kerner,</i> 404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972) (per curiam); <i>Instituto de Educacion Universal Corp. v. United States Dep't of Educ.,</i> 209 F.3d 18, 23-24 (1st Cir.2000). Here, however, the district court's intentions were plain; it issued two explicit warnings. Equally as important, Cintr&#243;n herself is an attorney (albeit not a member of the federal bar) who should have been well aware of the consequences of a dogged failure to comply with court orders. At the very least, Cintr&#243;n could &#8212; and should &#8212; have notified the court both of her inability to comply and of the reasons for that noncompliance. Having been warned twice that noncompliance could result in dismissal, she maintained a stoic silence at her peril.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn next to Cintr&#243;n's motion for reconsideration. However that motion is characterized, <i>see supra</i> note 3, we review the district court's disposition of it for abuse of discretion. <i>See Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen &amp; Helpers Union v. Superline Transp. Co.,</i> 953 F.2d 17, 19 (1st Cir.1992) (explicating standard of review referable to Rule 60(b) motions); <i>Appeal of Sun Pipe Line Co.,</i> 831 F.2d 22, 24-25 (1st Cir.1987) (explicating standard of review referable to Rule 59(e) motions). We discern no abuse of the trial court's discretion here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For convenience, we use the Rule 60(b) standard (although the outcome would be the same under the jurisprudence of Rule 59(e)). We have made it transparently clear that relief under Rule 60(b) \"is extraordinary in nature.\" <i>Karak v. Bursaw Oil Corp.,</i> 288 F.3d 15, 19 (1st Cir.2002). Accordingly, \"motions invoking that rule should be granted sparingly.\" <i>Id.</i> In considering such a motion, we recognize the district court's \"intimate, first-hand knowledge of the case,\" and, thus, defer broadly to that court's informed discretion. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cintr&#243;n claims that her failure to prosecute was the result of excusable neglect (and, therefore, should have been forgiven). She identifies her personal problems and her inability to retain counsel as exceptional circumstances justifying relief from judgment. We reject this proffer. The determination of what constitutes excusable neglect in a given case requires that the court take into account the totality of the circumstances surrounding the movant's omissions. <i>Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. Brunswick Assocs. Ltd. P'ship,</i> 507 U.S. 380, 395, 113 S.Ct. 1489, 123 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993); <i>D&#225;vila-&#193;lvarez v. Escuela de Medicina,</i> 257 F.3d 58, 64 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a bare minimum, a party who seeks relief from judgment on the basis of excusable neglect must offer a convincing explanation as to why the neglect was excusable. <i>Graphic Comm'ns Int'l Union v. Quebecor Printing Prov., Inc.,</i> 270 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2001); <i>Hosp. del Maestro v. NLRB,</i> 263 F.3d 173, 175 (1st Cir.2001) (per curiam). Cintr&#243;n has not carried this burden: the length of the delay was inordinate in this case; Cintr&#243;n's condition varied over time; and even if her ailments interfered to some extent with her ability to secure counsel &#8212; a matter on which we take no view &#8212; she offers no credible excuse for not communicating her plight to the district court in a timely fashion. When a litigant (especially a litigant who is trained as a lawyer) elects to file a suit pro se, her duty of attending to the case is not automatically excused by personal tragedy or emotional upheaval.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff's failure to communicate with the court brings this point into sharp focus. As we explained two decades ago, a party's \"first obligation is to make every effort to comply with the court's order. The second is to seek consent if compliance is, in fact, impossible. And the third is to seek court approval for noncompliance based on a truly valid reason.\" <i>Damiani v. R.I. Hosp.,</i> 704 F.2d 12, 17 (1st Cir.1983). Cintr&#243;n blatantly violated this code of conduct: among other things, she failed not only to inform the district court of her alleged impairments but also to seek judicial approval for her repeated noncompliance with procedural rules, court orders, and a series of deadlines. Even taking her description of her afflictions at face value, nothing about them excuses this persistent failure to communicate. Giving due weight to all of the circumstances surrounding Cintr&#243;n's extensive neglect, we would be hard pressed to find it excusable. A fortiori, we cannot find that the district court's denial of her motion for relief from judgment was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this aspect of the matter. Although Cintr&#243;n's case evokes sympathy, we often have remarked that hard cases have a propensity to make bad law. <i>E.g., Burnham v. Guardian Life Ins. Co.,</i> 873 F.2d 486, 487 (1st Cir.1989). Bearing in mind that the district court \"is best positioned to determine whether the justification proffered in support of a Rule 60(b) motion should serve to override the opposing party's rights and the law's institutional interest in finality,\" <i>Karak,</i> 288 F.3d at 19, we conclude that the circumstances to which Cintr&#243;n alludes, taken as a whole, are not sufficiently excusatory to demand the extraordinary relief that she requests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. \"In our adversary system of justice, each litigant remains under an abiding duty to take the legal steps that are necessary to protect his or her own interests.\" <i>Cotto v. United States,</i> 993 F.2d 274, 278 (1st Cir.1993). Given Cintr&#243;n's patent disregard of this duty, extending over many months, we hold that the district court acted within its discretion both in dismissing Cintr&#243;n's case for lack of prosecution and in denying her motion for reconsideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Cintr&#243;n's parents and niece also appear as plaintiffs and appellants. Because their claims are purely derivative, we treat the case as if Cintr&#243;n was the sole plaintiff and appellant. By the same token, Cintr&#243;n sued not only DACO (an agency of the Puerto Rican government) but also several public officials, including Angel E. Rotger-Sabat, Jos&#233; A. Alicea-Rivera, Jos&#233; M. Cintr&#243;n-Garc&#237;a, Zenaida Garc&#237;a-Villegas, Gladys E. M&#233;ndez-Hern&#225;ndez, Gerardo R. Pic&#243;-Del Rosario, and Elvia M. Camayd-V&#233;lez. We refer to the defendants, collectively, as DACO</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Alternatively, DACO sought a stay of proceedings pending the Supreme Court's decision in a case then under consideration. That case has since been decided<i>See Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett,</i> 531 U.S. 356, 121 S.Ct. 955, 148 L.Ed.2d 866 (2001). The stay request is, therefore, moot.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Cintr&#243;n's counsel styled this motion as a motion for relief from judgment under Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b) and contended that the district court should set aside its earlier order based upon excusable neglect. That creates an immediate problem for Cintr&#243;n, as a Rule 60(b) motion does not toll the running of the appeal period on the original judgment (and, therefore, an appeal from the denial of such a motion does not bring the merits of the underlying judgment up for review)<i>See Karak v. Bursaw Oil Corp.,</i> 288 F.3d 15, 18-19 (1st Cir.2002); <i>Rodriguez-Antuna v. Chase Manhattan Bank Corp.,</i> 871 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1989). Here, however, Cintr&#243;n's motion was filed within ten days of the entry of the district court's original judgment. Since we are not bound by a party's choice of label, we elect, favorably to Cintr&#243;n, to consider the motion as a motion to alter or amend the judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e). <i>See Lopez v. Corporaci&#243;n Azucarera de P.R.,</i> 938 F.2d 1510, 1513-14 (1st Cir.1991); <i>Silk v. Sandoval,</i> 435 F.2d 1266, 1267-68 (1st Cir.1971).

R.Civ.P. 41(b) and the district court's inherent case-management powers. In undertaking this task, we note that the plaintiff has not developed any argument based upon the district court's local rule governing dismissals for lack of prosecution, D.P.R.R. 313.1, and, thus, we do not consider that rule<i>See United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (explaining that issues not squarely raised on appeal are deemed abandoned).</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

For the reasons elucidated below, we reject her appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The subsidiary facts are fairly straightforward (although the record is ragged and the briefs confuse certain of the dates). DACO hired Cintr&#243;n as an attorney in or around 1997. The working relationship did not go smoothly. As a result, Cintr&#243;n filed a multifaceted claim of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) during the year 2000. In that document she charged DACO with violating the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 12101-12213, by refusing to accommodate her physical disability, and with political discrimination based upon her support of the Popular Democratic Party. In due course, the EEOC issued a right-to-sue letter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 15, 2000, Cintr&#243;n, armed with the right-to-sue letter, filed a pro se complaint in the federal district court. She again claimed that DACO had violated both the ADA and her right to free political association under the First Amendment. For good measure, she also alleged, inter alia, violations of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments; 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1983 and 1985; various sections of the Puerto Rico Constitution; and a potpourri of local laws. In an amended complaint, filed as a matter of right, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a), she added a Rehabilitation Act claim under 29 U.S.C. &#167; 794.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 29, 2000, the district court, citing Cintr&#243;n's failure to seek the issuance and service of summonses, ordered her to show cause why her case should not be dismissed for lack of diligent prosecution. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(m) (requiring service within 120 days from the filing of a complaint). The court's order was entered on the docket on December 4, 2000, and, shortly thereafter, Cintr&#243;n served the defendants. She also filed a written rejoinder in which she stated that difficulties in trying to obtain legal representation had led to the delay. She indicated that she would need an additional forty-five to sixty days to retain counsel. The court did not respond but, by not pressing the matter, effectively granted her the desired grace period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 16, 2001, Cintr&#243;n requested a further sixty-day extension in order to procure legal representation. Four days later, DACO served the plaintiff with a motion to dismiss the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> On March 15, 2001, DACO gave notice that it had served the plaintiff with a supplementary motion to dismiss. Cintr&#243;n did not respond to either of these filings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April of 2001, the further sixty-day extension sought in Cintr&#243;n's February 16 motion expired without an entry of appearance on her behalf. She remained mute. On June 4, 2001, DACO filed yet a third motion to dismiss, but Cintr&#243;n again neglected to reply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 21, 2001, the district court advised Cintr&#243;n that it would give her until July 2, 2001 to retain counsel and/or answer the pending motions. In that order, the court noted that it had, in effect, given Cintr&#243;n extra time; and that the extensions she had sought had \"long elapsed.\" The court explicitly warned Cintr&#243;n that \"[t]his [the grace period lasting through July 2, 2001] is the last extension before considering dismissing the case for lack of diligent prosecution.\" The court's admonition went unheeded: Cintr&#243;n did nothing, and, on July 16, 2001, the district court, true to its word, dismissed the case under Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b) for lack of prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 27, 2001, an attorney filed an entry of appearance on Cintr&#243;n's behalf, along with a motion for reconsideration.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The court summarily denied the motion. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn first to the district court's dismissal of the case for want of diligent prosecution. Cintr&#243;n's basic argument is that she was suffering from many afflictions (physical, psychological, and emotional) during the spring of 2001. These culminated in the performance of a biopsy on June 8, followed by a cancer diagnosis two weeks later. The problem, however, is that she failed to bring any of these travails to the attention of the district court in a timeous fashion. Instead, Cintr&#243;n dawdled for upwards of seven months; her only meaningful response during that period was a filing, early on, that attributed her dilatoriness to difficulty in securing the services of outside counsel. In that filing, she asked for an additional sixty days within which to retain counsel. But that period &#8212; like the initial forty-five-to-sixty-day period that she had specified &#8212; came and went without the achievement of any noticeable progress. During and after that interval, she neither secured counsel, nor answered the several pending motions, nor apprised the court of a need for more time, nor revealed that her efforts were hampered by medical problems.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, the order of dismissal cannot be faulted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> A district court, as part of its inherent power to manage its own docket, may dismiss a case sua sponte for any of the reasons prescribed in Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b). <i>E.g., Link v.

In undertaking that review, we consider all pertinent circumstances and balance the authority of the court to prevent undue delay against the policy of the law favoring the disposition of cases on the merits. <i>See HMG Prop. Investors, Inc. v. Parque Indus. Rio Canas, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"506586\"><a href=\"/opinion/506586/hmg-property-investors-inc-v-parque-industrial-rio-canas-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">847</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">908</span></a></span>, 917 (1st Cir.1988); <i>Richman v.

We remain mindful, however, that courts &#8212; especially trial courts&#8212;\"must be given considerable leeway in exercising their admitted authority to punish laggardly or noncompliant litigants.\" <i>Batiz Chamorro v. P.R. Cars, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200101\"><a href=\"/opinion/200101/batiz-chamorro-v-puerto-rico-cars/\"><span class=\"volume\">304</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the court exhibited extraordinary patience. First, it warned Cintr&#243;n, as early as December of 2000, that she was risking dismissal for lack of prosecution. Second, when Cintr&#243;n requested up to sixty days to put her case back on track, the court gave her that indulgence. Third, when she sought a further sixty-day period within which to regroup, the court again indulged her (and, indeed, effectively gave her twice that amount of time). Even at that juncture, the court did not dismiss the action outright, but, rather, issued another warning and allowed Cintr&#243;n a further opportunity to make amends. Cintr&#243;n rewarded this magnanimity by stonewalling: she never communicated with the court in an effort either to explain her personal situation or to shed light on what efforts she was making to obtain legal representation. In the end, the court was faced with Cintr&#243;n's protracted &#8212; and largely unexplained &#8212; noncompliance with time limits imposed by standing rules and specific orders. This protracted noncompliance, in the teeth of explicit warnings, amply justified a termination of the action. <i>See Top Entertainment Inc. v. Ortega,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199912\"><a href=\"/opinion/199912/top-entertainment-co-v-ortega/\"><span class=\"volume\">285</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span></a></span>, 118-19 (1st Cir.2002); <i>Figueroa Ruiz v. Alegria,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536977\"><a href=\"/opinion/536977/rafael-figueroa-ruiz-v-jose-e-alegria/\"><span class=\"volume\">896</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">645</span></a></span>, 648 (1st Cir.1990); <i>cf. Tower Ventures,</i> 296 F.3d at 46 (explaining that \"disobedience of court orders, in and of itself, constitutes extreme misconduct (and, thus, warrants dismissal)\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it is particularly noteworthy that Cintr&#243;n requested successive extensions of time within which to retain counsel, thus impliedly promising compliance by the end of that aggregate period. As we have said, \"[w]hen a litigant seeks an extension of time and proposes a compliance date, the court is entitled to expect that the litigant will meet its self-imposed deadline.\" <i>Tower Ventures,</i> 296 F.3d at 47. Cintr&#243;n's failure to achieve the time line that she herself had suggested weighs heavily against her. <i>See id.</i> (holding that, absent \"excusatory circumstances,\" a litigant's failure to adhere to such a deadline \"warrants an inference of deliberate manipulation\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cintr&#243;n's argument that pro se plaintiffs deserve greater leniency strikes us as disingenuous. There are, of course, some settings in which such leniency is appropriate. <i>See, e.g., Haines v. Kerner,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108432\"><a href=\"/opinion/108432/haines-v-kerner/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">519</span></a></span>, 520-21, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108432\"><a href=\"/opinion/108432/haines-v-kerner/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Here, however, the district court's intentions were plain; it issued two explicit warnings. Equally as important, Cintr&#243;n herself is an attorney (albeit not a member of the federal bar) who should have been well aware of the consequences of a dogged failure to comply with court orders. At the very least, Cintr&#243;n could &#8212; and should &#8212; have notified the court both of her inability to comply and of the reasons for that noncompliance. Having been warned twice that noncompliance could result in dismissal, she maintained a stoic silence at her peril.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn next to Cintr&#243;n's motion for reconsideration. However that motion is characterized, <i>see supra</i> note 3, we review the district court's disposition of it for abuse of discretion. <i>See Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen &amp; Helpers Union v. Superline Transp.

We have made it transparently clear that relief under Rule 60(b) \"is extraordinary in nature.\" <i>Karak v.

Accordingly, \"motions invoking that rule should be granted sparingly.\" <i>Id.</i> In considering such a motion, we recognize the district court's \"intimate, first-hand knowledge of the case,\" and, thus, defer broadly to that court's informed discretion. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cintr&#243;n claims that her failure to prosecute was the result of excusable neglect (and, therefore, should have been forgiven). She identifies her personal problems and her inability to retain counsel as exceptional circumstances justifying relief from judgment. We reject this proffer. The determination of what constitutes excusable neglect in a given case requires that the court take into account the totality of the circumstances surrounding the movant's omissions. <i>Pioneer Inv.

Quebecor Printing Prov., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199646\"><a href=\"/opinion/199646/graphic-communicatio-v-quebecor-printing/\"><span class=\"volume\">270</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.2001); <i>Hosp. del Maestro v.

Cintr&#243;n has not carried this burden: the length of the delay was inordinate in this case; Cintr&#243;n's condition varied over time; and even if her ailments interfered to some extent with her ability to secure counsel &#8212; a matter on which we take no view &#8212; she offers no credible excuse for not communicating her plight to the district court in a timely fashion. When a litigant (especially a litigant who is trained as a lawyer) elects to file a suit pro se, her duty of attending to the case is not automatically excused by personal tragedy or emotional upheaval.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff's failure to communicate with the court brings this point into sharp focus. As we explained two decades ago, a party's \"first obligation is to make every effort to comply with the court's order. The second is to seek consent if compliance is, in fact, impossible. And the third is to seek court approval for noncompliance based on a truly valid reason.\" <i>Damiani v. R.I. Hosp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"416550\"><a href=\"/opinion/416550/louis-m-damiani-md-v-rhode-island-hospital/\"><span class=\"volume\">704</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1983). Cintr&#243;n blatantly violated this code of conduct: among other things, she failed not only to inform the district court of her alleged impairments but also to seek judicial approval for her repeated noncompliance with procedural rules, court orders, and a series of deadlines. Even taking her description of her afflictions at face value, nothing about them excuses this persistent failure to communicate. Giving due weight to all of the circumstances surrounding Cintr&#243;n's extensive neglect, we would be hard pressed to find it excusable. A fortiori, we cannot find that the district court's denial of her motion for relief from judgment was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this aspect of the matter. Although Cintr&#243;n's case evokes sympathy, we often have remarked that hard cases have a propensity to make bad law. <i>E.g., Burnham v. Guardian Life Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522153\"><a href=\"/opinion/522153/joan-c-burnham-etc-v-the-guardian-life-insurance-company-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">873</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">486</span></a></span>, 487 (1st Cir.1989). Bearing in mind that the district court \"is best positioned to determine whether the justification proffered in support of a Rule 60(b) motion should serve to override the opposing party's rights and the law's institutional interest in finality,\" <i>Karak,</i> 288 F.3d at 19, we conclude that the circumstances to which Cintr&#243;n alludes, taken as a whole, are not sufficiently excusatory to demand the extraordinary relief that she requests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. \"In our adversary system of justice, each litigant remains under an abiding duty to take the legal steps that are necessary to protect his or her own interests.\" <i>Cotto v.

Given Cintr&#243;n's patent disregard of this duty, extending over many months, we hold that the district court acted within its discretion both in dismissing Cintr&#243;n's case for lack of prosecution and in denying her motion for reconsideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Cintr&#243;n's parents and niece also appear as plaintiffs and appellants.

We refer to the defendants, collectively, as DACO</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Alternatively, DACO sought a stay of proceedings pending the Supreme Court's decision in a case then under consideration. That case has since been decided<i>See Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118407\"><a href=\"/opinion/118407/board-of-trustees-of-univ-of-ala-v-garrett/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118407\"><a href=\"/opinion/118407/board-of-trustees-of-univ-of-ala-v-garrett/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">866</span></a></span> (2001). The stay request is, therefore, moot.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Cintr&#243;n's counsel styled this motion as a motion for relief from judgment under Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b) and contended that the district court should set aside its earlier order based upon excusable neglect. That creates an immediate problem for Cintr&#243;n, as a Rule 60(b) motion does not toll the running of the appeal period on the original judgment (and, therefore, an appeal from the denial of such a motion does not bring the merits of the underlying judgment up for review)<i>See Karak v. Bursaw Oil Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199935\"><a href=\"/opinion/199935/karak-v-bursaw-oil-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">288</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 18-19 (1st Cir.2002); <i>Rodriguez-Antuna v. Chase Manhattan Bank Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"520401\"><a href=\"/opinion/520401/migda-rodriguez-antuna-v-chase-manhattan-bank-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">871</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 2 (1st Cir. 1989). Here, however, Cintr&#243;n's motion was filed within ten days of the entry of the district court's original judgment. Since we are not bound by a party's choice of label, we elect, favorably to Cintr&#243;n, to consider the motion as a motion to alter or amend the judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e). <i>See Lopez v. Corporaci&#243;n Azucarera de P.R.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564961\"><a href=\"/opinion/564961/victor-lopez-v-corporacion-azucarera-de-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1510</span></a></span>, 1513-14 (1st Cir.1991); <i>Silk v. Sandoval,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"293893\"><a href=\"/opinion/293893/beatrice-silk-v-hilary-sandoval/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1266</span></a></span>, 1267-68 (1st Cir.1971). This enables us to reach the merits of the original order of dismissal.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> We analyze this issue in terms of Fed. R.Civ.P. 41(b) and the district court's inherent case-management powers. In undertaking this task, we note that the plaintiff has not developed any argument based upon the district court's local rule governing dismissals for lack of prosecution, D.P.R.R. 313.1, and, thus, we do not consider that rule<i>See United States v. Zannino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (explaining that issues not squarely raised on appeal are deemed abandoned).</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
