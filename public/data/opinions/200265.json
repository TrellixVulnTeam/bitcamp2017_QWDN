Marco Robles appeals from the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals's (\"BIA\") denial of his petitions for asylum\n\nand   withholding   of   removal.     He   also   challenges   the   BIA's\n\ndetermination that he was not denied due process of law at his\n\nimmigration hearing.     We affirm.\n\n                         I.    Background Facts\n\n           Robles is a Guatemalan of Mayan Indian descent.              In\n\nSeptember 1989, his uncle, who was the mayor of his small town, and\n\nhis three cousins were killed and their bodies were mutilated by\n\nunknown assailants.      Robles had worked closely with them on an\n\nagricultural education project, which was not opposed by the\n\ngovernment.   Robles is unsure if the killings were because of his\n\nuncle's position as mayor, or if his relatives were targeted\n\nbecause of their agricultural teachings.\n\n           Shortly after the murders, Robles was approached at a\n\npublic gathering and told, \"You are next.\"        Approximately eighteen\n\nmonths after the murders, Robles moved to Guatemala City, where he\n\nlived for six months.         He entered the United States on foot,\n\nwithout inspection, in January 1992.       Robles claimed that he fled\n\nGuatemala because he was \"just trying to preserve [his] life.\"\n\n           Robles filed for asylum in January 1996.       At an Order to\n\nShow Cause hearing in front of an Immigration Judge (\"IJ\"), Robles\n\nwas represented by Elizabeth Skelton, a Canadian attorney not\n\nadmitted to practice in the United States and not familiar with\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fimmigration law.     At his hearing, Robles testified that he felt\n\nfear   and   insecurity    in   his   homeland,     that   no   one    has   been\n\napprehended for the murders of his relatives, and that his family\n\nbelieves that he will not be safe if he returns.                 The IJ found\n\nRobles's testimony internally consistent and credible but concluded\n\nthat he was not eligible for asylum.           The IJ therefore concluded\n\nthat Robles was deportable as charged, and later denied Robles's\n\napplication for asylum and withholding relief. The BIA adopted the\n\nIJ's decision and dismissed Robles's appeal; it also rejected\n\nRobles's claim that his due process rights were violated by the\n\npresence of an unaccredited representative at his hearing.                   This\n\npetition for review followed.\n\n                          II.   Standard of Review\n\n             The decision of the BIA denying Robles asylum is subject\n\nto a deferential standard of review.\n\n             The BIA's determination that [petitioner] was\n             not eligible for asylum must be upheld if\n             \"supported by reasonable, substantial, and\n             probative evidence on the record considered as\n             a whole.\"    It can be reversed only if the\n             evidence presented by [petitioner] was such\n             that a reasonable factfinder would have to\n             conclude   that   the    requisite   fear   of\n             persecution existed.\n\nINS    v.   Elías-Zacarías,     502   U.S.   478,   481    (1992)     (citations\n\nomitted).\n\n             Robles's claim that the immigration judge violated his\n\ndue process rights by allowing his friend to represent him is\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\freviewed de novo.      See Morales v. INS, 208 F.3d 323, 327 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).\n\n                               III.   Discussion\n\n           After a review of the record, we determine that the BIA\n\nhad substantial evidence to deny Robles's claim for political\n\nasylum.    An applicant for asylum must demonstrate that he is\n\nstatutorily eligible for relief, and that he warrants it as a\n\nmatter of discretion.         An alien is eligible for asylum if he can\n\nshow that he either has suffered past persecution or has a well-\n\nfounded fear of future persecution on account of race, religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\nopinion.    Elías-Zacarías,        502   U.S.    at    481.     To   qualify   as\n\npersecution, a person's experience must rise above unpleasantness,\n\nharassment, and even basic suffering. Nelson v. INS, 223 F.3d 258,\n\n263 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n           Robles experienced tragic events in Guatemala: four of\n\nhis relatives were murdered and he was subjected to a vague threat.\n\nHowever,   the   BIA    was     reasonable      in    finding   that   this    is\n\ninsufficient evidence of past or future persecution to warrant\n\nasylum.1   Robles is unsure of the identity or motivation of those\n\nwho killed his relatives and threatened him.              He cannot show that\n\n\n\n1\n   Since Robles is unable to meet the standard for asylum, he is\nalso unable to meet the standard for withholding of deportation,\nwhich requires a higher showing. Velásquez v. Ashcroft, 305 F.3d\n62, 64 n.2 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n                                      -4-\n\fthey were targeted on account of their membership in a statutorily\n\nprotected group.       See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A).          Even after being\n\nthreatened, Robles continued to live in Guatemala without incident,\n\nspending nearly a year in the small town he grew up in and six\n\nmonths in Guatemala City.        Cf. Velásquez, 305 F.3d at 66 (noting\n\nthat petitioners' continued residence in Guatemala following the\n\nkilling of their family members and a threat against them supported\n\nthe BIA’s    finding     that   petitioners     were    not    targeted   on   any\n\nindividual basis).       Robles’s immediate family continues to reside\n\npeacefully in his hometown, and his father continues to work in\n\nagriculture.    Cf. id. (\"'The fact that close relatives continue to\n\nlive peacefully in the alien's homeland undercuts the alien's claim\n\nthat persecution awaits his return.'\") (quoting Aguilar-Solís v.\n\nINS, 168 F.3d 565, 573 (1st Cir. 1999)).               There was no evidence\n\npresented that Robles's life would be in danger if he returned.\n\nFinally, documentary evidence shows that a peace accord was signed\n\nin 1996, ending a thirty-six year civil war between guerilla groups\n\nand the government, and that the overall human rights situation in\n\nGuatemala has improved since Robles's departure.\n\n            We also hold that Robles was not denied due process at\n\nhis immigration hearing.          He was afforded the opportunity to\n\npresent   his   case    and   testified    on   his    own    behalf.     Skelton\n\nconducted a detailed direct examination.                Skelton also invited\n\nRobles to describe his decision to leave Guatemala and the current\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fsituation in that country.   After the testimony, Skelton directed\n\nthe IJ's attention to documentary evidence which she believed\n\nsupported Robles's asylum claim.      Robles was then cross-examined,\n\nand the IJ asked him questions.         Robles testified through an\n\ninterpreter and was permitted to answer all questions without\n\ncomment or interruption.     If Robles failed to present detailed\n\nevidence at his immigration hearing, it was not because he was not\n\ngiven sufficient opportunity.   Robles has also failed to show how\n\nhis case would have been decided differently if someone other than\n\nSkelton had represented him at the hearing.     See Michelson v. INS,\n\n897 F.2d 465, 468 (10th Cir. 1990).        He has not proffered any\n\nadditional testimonial or documentary evidence that would have been\n\npresented to the IJ had Skelton not participated in the hearing.\n\n          For the reasons stated above, the decision of the Board\n\nof Immigration Appeals is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f",
