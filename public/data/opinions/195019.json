Appellants,  Mario Torres-Melendez and Jose\n               \n\nBonilla-Martinez, were charged with having been involved in a\n\nlarge  scale  drug  conspiracy  which  ran  from  1985  until\n\nappellants and others were indicted in 1990.  Torres-Melendez\n\npled  guilty to conspiracy to import  cocaine in violation of\n\n21  U.S.C.   846 and was  sentenced to a term of imprisonment\n\nof 292 months.  Bonilla-Martinez  pled guilty to one count of\n\nconspiracy  to possess  with  intent  to distribute  cocaine,\n\nmarijuana and heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C.    841(a) and\n\n846.   He  was  sentenced  to  87  months  imprisonment,  the\n\nsentence to  be served  concurrently with  a sentence  of 264\n\nmonths imprisonment  imposed upon him in another  case.  Both\n\nappellants appeal their sentences.\n\nBonilla-Martinez\n                \n\n     Bonilla-Martinez' sole argument  on appeal  is that  the\n\nsentencing  court erred when it enhanced his criminal history\n\n2 points, pursuant to U.S.S.G.   4A1.1(b), because of a prior\n\nsentence  of imprisonment of  at least sixty  days.  Bonilla-\n\nMartinez contends that  since the criminal conduct  for which\n\nhe  was sentenced  in  that  prior  case occurred  after  the\n\ncriminal conduct  for which  he was  indicted in  the instant\n\ncase,  the  sentence  in  the  first case  is  not  a  \"prior\n\nsentence\" under the guidelines. \n\n     According to  the application notes, a  \"prior sentence\"\n\nunder   4A1.1  \"means a sentence imposed  prior to sentencing\n\non  the instant  offense, other than  a sentence  for conduct\n\nthat is  part of  the instant offense.   See    4A1.2(a).   A\n                                                             \n\nsentence  imposed after  the defendant's commencement  of the\n                                                             \n\ninstant  offense,  but  prior to  sentencing  on  the instant\n                                                             \n\noffense, is a prior sentence if it was for conduct other than\n                                                             \n\nconduct that  was part of  the instant offense.\"   U.S.S.G.  \n                                               \n\n4A1.2, comment. (n.1) (emphasis added); see U.S.S.G.   4A1.1,\n                                           \n\ncomment. (n.1) (term \"prior sentence\" defined at   4A1.2(a)).\n\nAppellant does not contend that the conduct in the prior case\n\nwas part of the instant offense.  \n\n     Appellant's  contention  that  his  prior  sentence  for\n\nconduct  unrelated to  the  present  offense  should  not  be\n\ncounted  simply  because  that  offense  occurred  after  the\n\npresent  offense  is  belied  by the  plain  language  of the\n\napplication  notes and  has been  rejected  by every  circuit\n\ncourt which has  considered this  issue.   See, e.g.,  United\n                                                             \n\nStates v. Tabaka, 982 F.2d 100, 101-02 (3d Cir. 1992); United\n                                                             \n\nStates v. Beddow, 957 F.2d 1330, 1337 (6th Cir. 1992); United\n                                                             \n\nStates v.  Hoy, 932 F.2d  1343, 1345 (9th Cir.  1991); United\n              \n\nStates  v.

We too find no merit in\n\nappellant's contention.\n\n                             -3-\n\nTorres-Melendez\n               \n\n     Torres-Melendez raises three claims.  First, he contends\n\nthat  the court  erred when it  increased his  offense level,\n\npursuant  to U.S.S.G.    3B1.3,  because he  \"used a  special\n\nskill,   in  a  manner  that  significantly  facilitated  the\n\ncommission . . .  of the offense.\"   Second,  he asserts that\n\nthe court erred in its determination of  his criminal history\n\ncategory.   Third, he contends that his counsel at sentencing\n\nwas constitutionally ineffective.  Since neither of the first\n\ntwo issues were raised below,  we review them only for \"plain\n\nerror.\"   \"Under this standard, we review only 'blockbusters:\n\nthose  errors  so  shocking that  they  seriously  affect the\n\nfundamental fairness and basic  integrity of the  proceedings\n\nconducted  below.'\"  United States v. Olivo-Infante, 938 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n1406, 1412 (1st Cir. 1991) (quoting United States v. Griffin,\n                                                            \n\n818  F.2d 97,  100  (1st  Cir.), cert.  denied  484 U.S.  844\n                                              \n\n(1987)).\n\n     The presentence report, adopted by the sentencing court,\n\nfound  that Torres-Melendez  had \"utilized his  knowledge and\n\nexpertise  in   welding  to   facilitate  the  smuggling   of\n\ncontrolled  substances  into  U.S. Territory.\"    The  report\n\nindicates  that he  had welded  compartments onto  industrial\n\nlawn  mowers into  which  cocaine was  secreted, that  he had\n\nmodified an automobile gas tank  to hold cocaine, that he had\n\nopened and then resealed the  cylinder of a steamroller  into\n\n                             -4-\n\nwhich cocaine  was packed,  and that he  had constructed  two\n\nsteel  tanks  used  to  transport  molasses  which  concealed\n\ncocaine.   These acts  clearly facilitated the  commission of\n\nthe offense  for which  appellant was  sentenced.   Appellant\n\ncontends,  however, that welding is not  a \"special skill\" as\n\ncontemplated by the guidelines. \n\n     The guidelines explain a \"special skill\" as \"a skill not\n\npossessed  by members  of  the  general  public  and  usually\n\nrequiring  substantial  education,   training  or  licensing.\n\nExamples would include pilots, lawyers, doctors, accountants,\n\nchemists,  and  demolition  experts.\"    U.S.S.G.      3B1.3,\n\ncomment. (n.1);  see also United States v.  Connell, 960 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n191, 197-98 (1st  Cir. 1992).  Welding of  the sort performed\n\nby appellant  during the  course of the  conspiracy is  not a\n\nskill   \"possessed  by  members  of  the  general  public.\"  \n\nAppellant  contends, however,  that welding  is  not a  skill\n\nrequiring  \"substantial  education, training  or  licensing.\"\n\nEven if we were to  agree, the guidelines indicate that these\n\ncharacteristics  are not always required for a finding that a\n\ndefendant possesses a \"special skill.\"   See United States v.\n                                                          \n\nSpencer,  Nos. 93-1041/1042, 1993  U.S. App. LEXIS  21651, at\n       \n\n*14 (2d  Cir. Aug. 25,  1993) (\"Because the comment  adds the\n\nword 'usually,' we find no basis for limiting the increase to\n\nonly those with formal educations or  professional skills.\");\n\nUnited States v.  Hummer, 916 F.2d 186, 191  (4th Cir. 1990),\n                        \n\n                             -5-\n\ncert. denied, 111 S.Ct. 1608 (1991) (use of term \"'usually' .\n            \n\n.  . implies  that substantial  training is  not a  mandatory\n\nprerequisite to making a special skills adjustment\").  Hence,\n\nwe cannot  say, as  a matter of  law, that  welding is  not a\n\n\"special skill\" as contemplated by section 3B1.3.\n\n     As far as  the application of the guideline to appellant\n\nis  concerned, we do  not ordinarily consider  a challenge to\n\nthe application of a particular guideline when that challenge\n\nhas not been raised in the court below.  See United States v.\n                                                          \n\nPilgrim Market Corp., 944 F.2d 14,  21 (1st Cir. 1991).   The\n                   \n\nrationale   behind  this  rule  is,  in  part,  that,  absent\n\nobjection, \"the district  court had a  right to believe  that\n\ndefendant agreed that  the facts [in the  presentence report]\n\nwere true and accurate.\"   Id., (quoting United States v. Fox\n                                                             \n\n889  F.2d   357,  359   (1st  Cir.   1989).    Further,   the\n\ndetermination   of  whether   appellant's  particular   skill\n\njustifies  an  increase  under section  3B1.3  is  \"likely to\n\ninvolve  drawing  sophisticated  inferences  from  a  web  of\n\ninterconnecting  facts.\" Connell, 960 F.2d at 198.  \"[W]hen a\n                                \n\ndefendant fails to raise the  issue below, we have no factual\n\nrecord   by  which   to  review   the   application  of   the\n\nguidelines.\"1  United States v.  Saucedo, 950 F.2d 1508, 1518\n                                        \n\n(10th Cir. 1991).   In these circumstances, we  find no plain\n\n                    \n\n1.  The  factual record we  do have indicates  that, although\nappellant  had   little  formal   education,  \"through   work\nexperience he became an . . . excellent welder.\" \n\n                             -6-\n\nerror  in the court's  increase of appellant's  offense level\n\nfor possession  of a \"special  skill.\"  Cf. United  States v.\n                                                          \n\nLopez, 923  F.2d 47, 50  (5th Cir.), cert. denied,  111 S.Ct.\n                                                 \n\n2032  (1991) (\"[q]uestions of  fact capable of  resolution by\n\nthe  district court upon  proper objection at  sentencing can\n\nnever constitute  plain error\");  Saucedo, 950  F.2d at  1508\n                                         \n\n(same).\n\n     Torres-Melendez also  contends that  the court  erred in\n\nassigning him a criminal  history category of III.   Category\n\nIII  includes defendants who have accumulated between 4 and 6\n\ncriminal  history points.  Appellant concedes that 2 criminal\n\nhistory  points were  properly assigned  to  him pursuant  to\n\nU.S.S.G.    4A1.1(d) because he committed the instant offense\n\nwhile on probation.  However, he asserts that  the assignment\n\nof 3 criminal points pursuant to   4A1.1(a) was in error.  He\n\nclaims that only 1 point should have been added and therefore\n\nthat his criminal history category is properly II.  \n\n     According  to  his  presentence  report,  appellant  was\n\nsentenced   to  a  three   year  term  of   imprisonment  for\n\ninvoluntary manslaughter/vehicular  homicide in  June 1983.  \n\nAfter three months, this sentence was modified to probation. \n\nThe  proper  number of  points  to  be added  to  appellant's\n\ncriminal history category  depends on  whether appellant  was\n\nincarcerated between June and September 1983, a fact not made\n\nclear  by  the   presentence  report.    If   appellant  were\n\n                             -7-\n\nincarcerated, 2 points should have been added to his criminal\n\nhistory category.   See U.S.S.G.   4A1.1(b)  (\"[a]dd 2 points\n                       \n\nfor  each prior  sentence of imprisonment  of at  least sixty\n\ndays\");  id.    4A1.2,  comment.  n. 2  (\"[t]o  qualify as  a\n           \n\nsentence  of imprisonment,  the defendant must  have actually\n\nserved a  period of  imprisonment on  such sentence\"). If  he\n\nwere  not, however, his criminal history category should have\n\nbeen increased  only 1 point.   See id.   4A1.1(c)  (\"[a]dd 1\n                                      \n\npoint for  each prior sentence  not counted in (a)  or (b)\").\n\nIn any  event,  the government  concedes  that the  3  points\n\nassigned by the  presentence report was in  error.2  However,\n\nit contends  that the  error  was harmless  because 2  points\n\nshould  have been added  to appellant's criminal  history and\n\nthis change would not affect his criminal history category.\n\n     Once again, the  failure to raise the objection below is\n\nfatal to appellant's  claim.  Absent an  adequately developed\n\nfactual  record,  we  are without  any  means  of determining\n\nwhether the court's  admitted error in assigning  appellant 3\n\ncriminal history  points  was  anything  more  than  harmless\n\nerror. Thus, we are unable  to say that assigning appellant a\n\n                    \n\n2.  The  record   contains  two  different   copies  of   the\npresentence report, one  of which assigns 3  criminal history\npoints for  the 1983 sentence,  the other 2.   Both appellant\nand  the government assume that the court assigned 3 criminal\nhistory  points.   Neither  makes  any mention  of  the other\nversion of the  presentence report.  For  purposes of review,\nwe too assume that the court added 3 points.\n\n                             -8-\n\ncriminal history  category  of III  was  plain error.3    See\n                                                             \n\nsupra.  \n     \n\n     Finally,  Torres-Melendez   asserts  that   he  received\n\nineffective  assistance of counsel at sentencing.  Since this\n\nclaim  was  not  raised  below,  this  court  has  neither  a\n\ndeveloped  factual  record  sufficient  to sustain  appellate\n\nreview nor the  evaluation of the sentencing court  as to the\n\nmerits of the  claim.  In such circumstances,  this court has\n\nrepeatedly  indicated that the  proper vehicle for  raising a\n\nclaim of  ineffective  counsel is  through  the filing  of  a\n\npetition  under 28  U.S.C.     2255.   See  United States  v.\n                                                         \n\nSanchez, 917 F.2d 607, 612  (1st Cir. 1990), cert. denied 111\n                                                         \n\nS.Ct. 1625 (1991) (citing cases).\n\n     Affirmed.\n             \n\n                    \n\n3.    Appellant's sentence  of 292  months  falls within  the\nrange of 262-327 months to  which he would be subject if  his\ncriminal history category  were II.  Appellant  has presented\nno  evidence, and  the record  reveals none,  that  the court\nwould  have  imposed a  lesser  sentence  if the  range  were\ndifferent.\n\n                             -9-\n",

Appellants,  Mario Torres-Melendez and Jose\n               \n\nBonilla-Martinez, were charged with having been involved in a\n\nlarge  scale  drug  conspiracy  which  ran  from  1985  until\n\nappellants and others were indicted in 1990.  Torres-Melendez\n\npled  guilty to conspiracy to import  cocaine in violation of\n\n21  U.S.C.   846 and was  sentenced to a term of imprisonment\n\nof 292 months.  Bonilla-Martinez  pled guilty to one count of\n\nconspiracy  to possess  with  intent  to distribute  cocaine,\n\nmarijuana and heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C.    841(a) and\n\n846.   He  was  sentenced  to  87  months  imprisonment,  the\n\nsentence to  be served  concurrently with  a sentence  of 264\n\nmonths imprisonment  imposed upon him in another  case.  Both\n\nappellants appeal their sentences.\n\nBonilla-Martinez\n                \n\n     Bonilla-Martinez' sole argument  on appeal  is that  the\n\nsentencing  court erred when it enhanced his criminal history\n\n2 points, pursuant to U.S.S.G.   4A1.1(b), because of a prior\n\nsentence  of imprisonment of  at least sixty  days.  Bonilla-\n\nMartinez contends that  since the criminal conduct  for which\n\nhe  was sentenced  in  that  prior  case occurred  after  the\n\ncriminal conduct  for which  he was  indicted in  the instant\n\ncase,  the  sentence  in  the  first case  is  not  a  \"prior\n\nsentence\" under the guidelines. \n\n     According to  the application notes, a  \"prior sentence\"\n\nunder   4A1.1  \"means a sentence imposed  prior to sentencing\n\non  the instant  offense, other than  a sentence  for conduct\n\nthat is  part of  the instant offense.   See    4A1.2(a).

(n.1) (term \"prior sentence\" defined at   4A1.2(a)).\n\nAppellant does not contend that the conduct in the prior case\n\nwas part of the instant offense.  \n\n     Appellant's  contention  that  his  prior  sentence  for\n\nconduct  unrelated to  the  present  offense  should  not  be\n\ncounted  simply  because  that  offense  occurred  after  the\n\npresent  offense  is  belied  by the  plain  language  of the\n\napplication  notes and  has been  rejected  by every  circuit\n\ncourt which has  considered this  issue.

Category\n\nIII  includes defendants who have accumulated between 4 and 6\n\ncriminal  history points.  Appellant concedes that 2 criminal\n\nhistory  points were  properly assigned  to  him pursuant  to\n\nU.S.S.G.    4A1.1(d) because he committed the instant offense\n\nwhile on probation.  However, he asserts that  the assignment\n\nof 3 criminal points pursuant to   4A1.1(a) was in error.  He\n\nclaims that only 1 point should have been added and therefore\n\nthat his criminal history category is properly II.  \n\n     According  to  his  presentence  report,  appellant  was\n\nsentenced   to  a  three   year  term  of   imprisonment  for\n\ninvoluntary manslaughter/vehicular  homicide in  June 1983.  \n\nAfter three months, this sentence was modified to probation. \n\nThe  proper  number of  points  to  be added  to  appellant's\n\ncriminal history category  depends on  whether appellant  was\n\nincarcerated between June and September 1983, a fact not made\n\nclear  by  the   presentence  report.    If   appellant  were\n\n                             -7-\n\nincarcerated, 2 points should have been added to his criminal\n\nhistory category.   See U.S.S.G.   4A1.1(b)  (\"[a]dd 2 points\n                       \n\nfor  each prior  sentence of imprisonment  of at  least sixty\n\ndays\");  id.    4A1.2,  comment.  n. 2  (\"[t]o  qualify as  a\n           \n\nsentence  of imprisonment,  the defendant must  have actually\n\nserved a  period of  imprisonment on  such sentence\"). If  he\n\nwere  not, however, his criminal history category should have\n\nbeen increased  only 1 point.   See id.   4A1.1(c)  (\"[a]dd 1\n                                      \n\npoint for  each prior sentence  not counted in (a)  or (b)\").\n\nIn any  event,  the government  concedes  that the  3  points\n\nassigned by the  presentence report was in  error.2  However,\n\nit contends  that the  error  was harmless  because 2  points\n\nshould  have been added  to appellant's criminal  history and\n\nthis change would not affect his criminal history category.\n\n     Once again, the  failure to raise the objection below is\n\nfatal to appellant's  claim.  Absent an  adequately developed\n\nfactual  record,  we  are without  any  means  of determining\n\nwhether the court's  admitted error in assigning  appellant 3\n\ncriminal history  points  was  anything  more  than  harmless\n\nerror. Thus, we are unable  to say that assigning appellant a\n\n                    \n\n2.  The  record   contains  two  different   copies  of   the\npresentence report, one  of which assigns 3  criminal history\npoints for  the 1983 sentence,  the other 2.   Both appellant\nand  the government assume that the court assigned 3 criminal\nhistory  points.   Neither  makes  any mention  of  the other\nversion of the  presentence report.  For  purposes of review,\nwe too assume that the court added 3 points.\n\n                             -8-\n\ncriminal history  category  of III  was  plain error.3    See\n                                                             \n\nsupra.  \n     \n\n     Finally,  Torres-Melendez   asserts  that   he  received\n\nineffective  assistance of counsel at sentencing.  Since this\n\nclaim  was  not  raised  below,  this  court  has  neither  a\n\ndeveloped  factual  record  sufficient  to sustain  appellate\n\nreview nor the  evaluation of the sentencing court  as to the\n\nmerits of the  claim.  In such circumstances,  this court has\n\nrepeatedly  indicated that the  proper vehicle for  raising a\n\nclaim of  ineffective  counsel is  through  the filing  of  a\n\npetition  under 28  U.S.C.     2255.   See  United States  v.\n                                                         \n\nSanchez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"550638\"><a href=\"/opinion/550638/united-states-v-edwin-sanchez-united-states-of-america-v-gregorio/\"><span class=\"volume\">917</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">607</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 612  (1st Cir. 1990), cert. denied </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span>\n                                                         \n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.
