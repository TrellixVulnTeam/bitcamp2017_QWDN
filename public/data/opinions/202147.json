This appeal concerns a dispute\n\nunder the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act (\"PMPA\").             15 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 2801 et seq.        The PMPA \"was enacted by Congress in 1978 to\n\nprotect    gasoline    franchisees    from   arbitrary   or   discriminatory\n\ntermination or nonrenewal of their franchises.\"          Esso Standard Oil\n\nCo. v. Dep't of Consumer Affairs, 793 F.2d 431, 432 (1st Cir.\n\n1986).     \"Congress noted that the disparity of bargaining power\n\nexisting between franchisors and franchisees sometimes resulted in\n\nfranchise agreements that amounted to contracts of adhesion.\"              Id.\n\n            Plaintiff    Esso     Standard   Oil   Company    (Puerto    Rico)\n\n(\"Esso\") had a franchise agreement with defendant José H. Monroig-\n\nZayas (\"Monroig\").      Esso and Monroig could not agree to the terms\n\nof a renewal agreement, and Esso sought a declaratory judgment from\n\nthe district court that it had satisfied the requirements of the\n\nPMPA.     In turn, Monroig asked for a preliminary injunction under\n\nthe PMPA to maintain the franchise relationship.               The district\n\ncourt denied Monroig's request for a preliminary injunction, and\n\nMonroig appeals.      We affirm.\n\n                                I.   Background\n\n            Beginning in January 1996, Monroig ran an Esso gas\n\nstation    as   a   franchisee.      Under   a   three-year   contract    from\n\nJanuary 1, 2001 to January 1, 2004, Monroig paid monthly rent of\n\n$3,831.    On July 11, 2003, Esso sent Monroig a contract for a new\n\nthree-year lease that would begin on January 1, 2004.            Under this\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fcontract, the rent increased by about five percent for each of the\n\nfirst two years (to $4,035 and $4,235) and did not further increase\n\nthe third year.         Other modifications included the removal of a\n\nradiator repair shop from the premises and a prohibition against\n\nassignment or sublease of the premises. Monroig disputed the terms\n\nof the renewal.       On September 30, 2003, Esso sent Monroig a notice\n\nof nonrenewal based on the parties' failure to agree to the terms\n\nof the renewal.\n\n               For the purpose of continuing negotiations, Esso granted\n\nfive   short-term      extensions    to    the        prior   contract.      The   last\n\nextension expired on June 30, 2004, and since the parties had not\n\ncome to an agreement, Esso stopped delivering gasoline the next\n\nday.\n\n                         II.   Notice Under the PMPA\n\n               Under the PMPA, the franchisor must provide adequate\n\nnotice    to    the   franchisee    of    the    nonrenewal      of   the    franchise\n\nagreement.      The general rule is that notice must be given at least\n\n90 days before the nonrenewal takes effect.                    15 U.S.C. § 2804(a)\n\n(2).     An exception to this general rule allows the franchisor to\n\nprovide notice on the earliest, reasonably practicable date where\n\nthe circumstances make a 90-day notice unreasonable.                        Id. § 2804\n\n(b)(1).         The   district     court        did     not   address     the   notice\n\nrequirements, stating that Monroig did not \"allege that . . . the\n\nnotice was somehow defective.\"             Because our review of the record\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\findicates that Monroig did indeed press this point below, we now\n\naddress the issue.\n\n          Other    aspects    of   the    PMPA    must   be   considered    in\n\nconjunction with the notice requirements.                The PMPA offers a\n\npreliminary   injunction     standard     to    franchisees   that   is    more\n\nforgiving than the common law standard, see id. § 2805(b)(2), but\n\nin order to take advantage of this more forgiving standard, the\n\nfranchisee's request must be timely, see id. § 2805(b)(4).                 The\n\ntimeliness of the franchisee's request for a preliminary injunction\n\ndepends on the notice it received.             If a franchisee receives at\n\nleast 90 days notice, then it has 90 days from the date of its\n\nreceipt of the notice to file a preliminary injunction motion. Id.\n\n§ 2805(b)(4)(A).     If a franchisee receives less than a 90-day\n\nnotice, then it has 30 days from the date of the nonrenewal to file\n\na preliminary injunction motion.         Id. § 2805(b)(4)(C).\n\n          The existing franchise agreement between Esso and Monroig\n\nwas due to expire on January 1, 2004, and Esso sent Monroig a\n\nnotice of nonrenewal 90 days before this date.                 Absent other\n\ncircumstances, this notice would clearly have been sufficient under\n\n§ 2804(a)(2).   Esso argues that it complied with the PMPA and that\n\nMonroig was required to seek a preliminary injunction by January 1,\n\n2004.   Monroig argues that the notice was essentially revoked by\n\nEsso because the parties continued to negotiate for six more\n\nmonths, until June 30, 2004.       Further, Monroig contends that the\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fstatute    should    not   be   construed   to    require    him    to   seek   a\n\npreliminary injunction while in the midst of negotiating a renewal.\n\n            We think that the circumstances of this case justify the\n\napplication of the alternative notice requirements of § 2804(b)(1).\n\nIn the absence of any extensions to the original contract, Esso had\n\ncomplied with the PMPA's notice requirements.              This notice is not\n\nrevoked by the parties' mutual agreement to extend the original\n\ncontract for the purpose of continuing negotiations.               Monroig knew\n\nvery well that the failure to come to an agreement on the terms of\n\nthe renewal meant an end to the franchise relationship.                  Monroig\n\ndid not know, however, the definitive date of the nonrenewal until\n\nthe contract negotiations permanently ceased.               The PMPA requires\n\nthe franchisor to include in its notice \"the date on which . . .\n\nnonrenewal takes effect.\"          Id. § 2804(c)(3)(B).            Under these\n\ncircumstances, we find that Esso gave notice to Monroig of the\n\ndefinitive    date    of   nonrenewal      on    the   earliest,    reasonably\n\npracticable date.      See id. § 2804(b)(1).\n\n            We believe that this outcome supports the policy concerns\n\nunderlying the PMPA.        A franchisor who initially satisfies the\n\nnotice requirements of § 2804(a)(2) and then continues negotiations\n\nwith a franchisee is not penalized for its efforts to reach a\n\ncompromise agreement. In addition, a franchisee is not required to\n\nfile   a   preliminary     injunction   motion     while    negotiations     are\n\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fongoing, which would not be conducive to fostering an agreement\n\nbetween the parties.     See id. § 2805(b)(4)(C).\n\n               III.    Preliminary Injunction Standard\n\n          We   now    address   the   proper   standard   for   determining\n\nwhether the preliminary injunction should be granted.            Esso urges\n\nthe common-law standard, see Bl(a)ck Tea Soc'y v. City of Boston,\n\n378 F.3d 8, 11 (1st Cir. 2004), and Monroig urges the standard\n\noutlined in the PMPA, see 15 U.S.C. § 2805(b)(2).                 The PMPA\n\nauthorizes a standard for granting preliminary injunctions that is\n\nmore forgiving than the common law standard, but in order to\n\nbenefit from this standard, the franchisee must be timely in its\n\nrequest for a preliminary injunction.          See id. § 2805(b)(4).    The\n\nPMPA does not specify what a district court should do if the\n\nfranchisee is tardy in its request.             To determine the proper\n\nstandard, we must determine whether Monroig was timely and, if not,\n\nwhat the proper course of action should be.\n\n          A.   Timeliness\n\n          Given our discussion of the notice requirements, above,\n\nwe have no problem finding that Monroig did not timely seek a\n\npreliminary injunction. Pursuant to our determination that Esso\n\ngave notice to Monroig on the earliest, reasonably practicable date\n\nunder § 2804(b)(1), Monroig had 30 days from the nonrenewal to\n\ntimely request a preliminary injunction.            Id. § 2805(b)(4)(C).\n\nMonroig requested a preliminary injunction on September 9, 2004,\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fwhich was more than 30 days after the nonrenewal date of June 30,\n\n2004.\n\n            B.    Standard for an Untimely Request\n\n            The    PMPA    does     not   provide   much    guidance    to   courts\n\nconsidering an untimely request for a preliminary injunction.                   The\n\nPMPA merely states that \"the court need not exercise its equity\n\npowers    to     compel    continuation     or    renewal    of   the   franchise\n\nrelationship if such action was [not timely] commenced.\"                        Id.\n\n§ 2805(b)(4).      No circuit court has yet addressed this issue.              The\n\ndistrict court below noted that other district courts have taken\n\nthree different approaches when the franchisee is tardy in seeking\n\nequitable relief: (1) \"outright dismissal of the franchisee's claim\n\nfor equitable relief\"; (2) reliance \"in part upon the franchisee's\n\nfailure to timely commence an action in denying equitable relief\";\n\nand (3) \"adjudge the request under the common law standard.\"                   See\n\nEsso Std. Oil Co. (P.R.) v. Monroig Zayas, 352 F. Supp. 2d 165, 171\n\n(D.P.R. 2005).       The district court found the third option \"to be\n\nthe better reasoned approach\" and applied the common-law standard.\n\nId.     We agree with the district court that this is the proper\n\napproach.\n\n            In     the    absence    of   the    more   forgiving      preliminary\n\ninjunction standard described in the PMPA, courts would apply the\n\ncommon-law standard, which does not include any specific time\n\nlimitations.      Congress created the PMPA to rectify \"the disparity\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fof bargaining power existing between franchisors and franchisees.\"\n\nDep't of Consumer Affairs, 793 F.2d at 432.                  By creating a more\n\nforgiving preliminary injunction standard in the PMPA, Congress\n\ngave more power to franchisees.                We do not think that Congress\n\nintended to give with one hand and take away with the other.\n\nApplying    the    common-law       standard        to   untimely   requests    for\n\ninjunctions therefore comports well with the underlying purpose of\n\nthe PMPA.\n\n                       IV.       Preliminary Injunction\n\n            We now apply the common-law standard.                   We weigh four\n\nfactors in determining whether a preliminary injunction should be\n\ngranted:\n\n            (1) the likelihood of success on the merits;\n            (2) the potential for irreparable harm [to the\n            movant] if the injunction is denied; (3) the\n            balance of relevant impositions, i.e., the\n            hardship to the nonmovant if enjoined as\n            contrasted with the hardship to the movant if\n            no injunction issues; and (4) the effect (if\n            any) of the court's ruling on the public\n            interest.\n\nBl(a)ck    Tea    Soc'y,   378    F.3d   at    11    (internal   quotation     marks\n\nomitted).    The party seeking the preliminary injunction bears the\n\nburden of establishing that these four factors weigh in its favor.\n\nNieves-Márquez v. Puerto Rico, 353 F.3d 108, 120 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n\"The sine qua non of this four-part inquiry is likelihood of\n\nsuccess on the merits: if the moving party cannot demonstrate that\n\nhe is likely to succeed in his quest, the remaining factors become\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fmatters of idle curiosity.\"            New Comm Wireless Servs., Inc. v.\n\nSprintCom, Inc., 287 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2002).             The district court\n\ndenied the preliminary injunction, and we review for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.     Id.\n\n            The district court addressed only the first factor,\n\nfinding that Monroig had not shown a substantial likelihood of\n\nsuccess    on   the    merits.    We   agree   with   the    district   court's\n\ndetermination and find it unnecessary to address the remaining\n\nfactors.    To this end, we now address the likelihood of success on\n\nthe merits.\n\n            The PMPA lists several grounds under which a franchisor\n\ncan choose not to renew a franchise agreement.              One such ground is\n\nthe \"failure of the franchisor and the franchisee to agree to\n\nchanges or additions to the provisions of the franchise.\"                    15\n\nU.S.C. § 2802(b)(3)(A). In negotiating any changes or additions to\n\nthe franchise agreement, the franchisor must have acted (1) \"in\n\ngood faith and in the normal course of business\" and (2) not for\n\nthe   purpose     of    \"preventing     the    renewal   of    the   franchise\n\nrelationship.\"        Id.   Monroig's only argument is that Esso acted in\n\nbad faith during the negotiations.1\n\n            The requirement that a franchisor act \"in good faith and\n\nin the normal course of business\" is not a stringent one.               The test\n\n\n1\n    Monroig's passing reference in his brief to the second\nrequirement is not sufficiently developed to preserve the argument\nfor appeal.\n\n                                       -9-\n\fis whether the \"franchisor had acted in subjective good faith in\n\nrequesting the changes, and not whether the demanded changes were\n\nthe result of reasonable business judgments.\"    Dep't of Consumer\n\nAffairs, 793 F.2d at 432 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nCongress sought to \"provide adequate protection of franchisees from\n\narbitrary or discriminatory termination or nonrenewal, yet avoid\n\njudicial scrutiny of the business judgement itself.\"   Id.   We have\n\nfound that the \"good faith requirement requires merely that a\n\nfranchisor not act with evil motive or discriminate selectively\n\nagainst franchisees.\"    Id. (internal quotation marks and brackets\n\nomitted).\n\n            Monroig has not borne his burden to show that Esso did\n\nnot act in good faith.     Monroig speculates that Esso might have\n\nviolated Puerto Rico regulations that limit the amount of rent that\n\nmay be charged to gasoline filling stations.       Monroig further\n\nfaults Esso's failure to show that it had complied with these\n\nregulations. However, it is Monroig who bears the burden of proof.\n\nHe could have discovered the necessary information to ascertain\n\nwhether Esso complied with the regulations but did not do so.    He\n\ncannot now use such speculation to establish a lack of good faith.2\n\n\n\n\n2\n   We do not make any statement as to whether compliance with the\nPuerto Rico regulations is relevant to whether Esso acted in good\nfaith.\n\n                                -10-\n\f              Monroig also points to an apparent clerical error by Esso\n\nthat was revealed during the preliminary injunction hearing.                He\n\ncharacterizes this error as manipulation of data and argues that it\n\nis evidence of bad faith.          Given that the error was in Monroig's\n\nfavor and resulted in a lower rent than what he should have been\n\ncharged, we do not find this error relevant.              Monroig also faults\n\nEsso for not producing the testimony of the person who discovered\n\nthe error, but as the district court noted, Monroig made no attempt\n\nto call this person as a witness.\n\n              Finally, Monroig urges that Esso's bargaining tactics\n\nshowed an absence of good faith.           He notes that at one point in the\n\nnegotiations \"Esso took its interest in a rent increase off the\n\ntable\"   only    to   bring   it    up    again   \"four   months   later   when\n\nsignificant progress had been made in the negotiations and an\n\nagreement was imminent.\"           Such bargaining does not rise to the\n\nlevel of an \"evil motive\" and not even remotely indicative of bad\n\nfaith.   In    contrast, the rent increases proposed by Esso were five\n\npercent for each of the first two years and zero percent for the\n\nfinal year.      In light of the fact that courts have upheld rent\n\nincreases of 100 to 300 percent, see Dep't of Consumer Affairs, 793\n\nF.2d at 432, Esso's modest request suggests that it negotiated in\n\ngood faith.\n\n              Monroig also argues that the district court committed\n\nerror in applying the common-law standard without giving notice to\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\fthe parties of its intent to do so.   Having only argued the PMPA\n\nstandard, Monroig claims he was denied the opportunity to fully\n\nargue his case before the district court.   We find this assertion\n\nmeritless for three reasons. First, under either standard, Monroig\n\nwas required to show some level of success on the merits.3   Thus,\n\nhis arguments going to the merits would have been the same under\n\neither standard. Second, even if we had applied the PMPA standard,\n\nwe would still have denied the injunction, because Monroig has\n\nutterly failed to present any evidence of bad faith on the part of\n\nEsso. Finally, Monroig had the opportunity to argue the common-law\n\nstandard on appeal, and he has not explained how he was prevented\n\nfrom presenting any relevant evidence before the district court.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n3\n     Under the PMPA standard, Monroig was required to show\n\"sufficiently serious questions going to the merits,\" 15 U.S.C.\n§ 2805(b)(2), while under the common law standard, he was required\nto show his likelihood of success on the merits.\n\n                              -12-\n\f",

On July 11, 2003, Esso sent Monroig a contract for a new three-year lease that would begin on January 1, 2004. Under this contract, the rent increased by about five percent for each of the first two years (to $4,035 and $4,235) and did not further increase the third year.

Notice Under the PMPA</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the PMPA, the franchisor must provide adequate notice to the franchisee of the nonrenewal of the franchise agreement. The general rule is that notice must be given at least 90 days before the nonrenewal takes effect. 15 U.S.C. &#167; 2804(a)(2). An exception to this general rule allows the franchisor to provide notice on the earliest, reasonably practicable date where the circumstances make a 90-day notice unreasonable. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2804(b)(1). The district court did not address the notice requirements, stating that Monroig did not \"allege that ... the notice was somehow defective.\" Because our review of the record indicates that Monroig did indeed press this point below, we now address the issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other aspects of the PMPA must be considered in conjunction with the notice requirements. The PMPA offers a preliminary injunction standard to franchisees that is more forgiving than the common law standard, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 2805(b)(2), but in order to take advantage of this more forgiving standard, the franchisee's request must be timely, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 2805(b)(4). The timeliness of the franchisee's request for a preliminary injunction depends on the notice it received. If a franchisee receives at least 90 days notice, then it has 90 days from the <i>date of its receipt of the notice</i> to file a preliminary injunction motion. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2805(b)(4)(A). If a franchisee receives less than a 90-day notice, then it has 30 days from the <i>date of the nonrenewal</i> to file a preliminary injunction motion. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2805(b)(4)(C).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The existing franchise agreement between Esso and Monroig was due to expire on January 1, 2004, and Esso sent Monroig a notice of nonrenewal 90 days before this date. Absent other circumstances, this notice would clearly have been sufficient under &#167; 2804(a)(2). Esso argues that it complied with the PMPA and that Monroig was required to seek a preliminary injunction by January 1, 2004. Monroig argues that the notice was essentially revoked by Esso because the parties continued to negotiate for six more months, until June 30, 2004. Further, Monroig contends that the statute should not be construed to require him to seek a preliminary injunction while in the midst of negotiating a renewal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that the circumstances of this case justify the application of the alternative notice requirements of &#167; 2804(b)(1). In the absence of any extensions to the original contract, Esso had complied with the PMPA's notice requirements. This notice is not revoked by the parties' mutual agreement to extend the original contract for the purpose of continuing negotiations. Monroig knew very well that the failure to come to an agreement on the terms of the renewal meant an end to the franchise relationship. Monroig did not know, however, the definitive date of the nonrenewal until the contract negotiations permanently ceased. The PMPA requires the franchisor to include in its notice \"the date on which ... nonrenewal takes effect.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2804(c)(3)(B). Under these circumstances, we find that Esso gave notice to Monroig of the definitive date of nonrenewal on the earliest, reasonably practicable date. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 2804(b)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe that this outcome supports the policy concerns underlying the PMPA. A franchisor who initially satisfies the notice requirements of &#167; 2804(a)(2) and then continues negotiations with a franchisee is not penalized for its efforts to reach a compromise agreement. In addition, a franchisee is not required to file a preliminary injunction motion while negotiations are ongoing, which would not be conducive to fostering an agreement between the parties. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 2805(b)(4)(C).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. Preliminary Injunction Standard</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now address the proper standard for determining whether the preliminary injunction should be granted. Esso urges the common-law standard, <i>see Bl(a)ck Tea Soc'y v. City of Boston,</i> 378 F.3d 8, 11 (1st Cir.2004), and Monroig urges the standard outlined in the PMPA, <i>see</i> 15 U.S.C. &#167; 2805(b)(2). The PMPA authorizes a standard for granting preliminary injunctions that is more forgiving than the common law standard, but in order to benefit from this standard, the franchisee must be timely in its request for a preliminary injunction. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 2805(b)(4). The PMPA does not specify what a district court should do if the franchisee is tardy in its request. To determine the proper standard, we must determine whether Monroig was timely and, if not, what the proper course of action should be.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Timeliness</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given our discussion of the notice requirements, above, we have no problem finding that Monroig did not timely seek a preliminary injunction. Pursuant to our determination that Esso gave notice to Monroig on the earliest, reasonably practicable date under &#167; 2804(b)(1), Monroig had 30 days from the nonrenewal to timely request a preliminary injunction. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2805(b)(4)(C). Monroig requested a preliminary injunction on September 9, 2004, which was more than 30 days after the nonrenewal date of June 30, 2004.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Standard for an Untimely Request</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PMPA does not provide much guidance to courts considering an untimely request for a preliminary injunction. The PMPA merely states that \"the court need not exercise its equity powers to compel continuation or renewal of the franchise relationship if such action was [not timely] commenced.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2805(b)(4). No circuit court has yet addressed this issue. The district court below noted that other district courts have taken three different approaches when the franchisee is tardy in seeking equitable relief: (1) \"outright dismissal of the franchisee's claim for equitable relief\"; (2) reliance \"in part upon the franchisee's failure to timely commence an action in denying equitable relief\"; and (3) \"adjudge the request under the common law standard.\" <i>See Esso Std. Oil Co. (P.R.) v. Monroig Zayas,</i> 352 F.Supp.2d 165, 171 (D.P.R.2005). The district court found the third option \"to be the better reasoned approach\" and applied the common-law standard. <i>Id.</i> We agree with the district court that this is the proper approach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the absence of the more forgiving preliminary injunction standard described in the PMPA, courts would apply the common-law standard, which does not include any specific time limitations. Congress created the PMPA to rectify \"the disparity of bargaining power existing between franchisors and franchisees.\" <i>Dep't of Consumer Affairs,</i> 793 F.2d at 432. By creating a more forgiving preliminary injunction standard in the PMPA, Congress gave more power to franchisees. We do not think that Congress intended to give with one hand and take away with the other. Applying the common-law standard to untimely requests for injunctions therefore comports well with the underlying purpose of the PMPA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Preliminary Injunction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now apply the common-law standard. We weigh four factors in determining whether a preliminary injunction should be granted:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) the likelihood of success on the merits; (2) the potential for irreparable harm [to the movant] if the injunction is denied; (3) the balance of relevant impositions, i.e., the hardship to the nonmovant if enjoined as contrasted with the hardship to the movant if no injunction issues; and (4) the effect (if any) of the court's ruling on the public interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Bl(a)ck Tea Soc'y,</i> 378 F.3d at 11 (internal quotation marks omitted). The party seeking the preliminary injunction bears the burden of establishing that these four factors weigh in its favor. <i>Nieves-M&#225;rquez v. Puerto Rico,</i> 353 F.3d 108, 120 (1st Cir.2003). \"The sine qua non of this four-part inquiry is likelihood of success on the merits: if the moving party cannot demonstrate that he is likely to succeed in his quest, the remaining factors become matters of idle curiosity.\" <i>New Comm Wireless Servs., Inc. v. SprintCom, Inc.,</i> 287 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.2002). The district court denied the preliminary injunction, and we review for abuse of discretion. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court addressed only the first factor, finding that Monroig had not shown a substantial likelihood of success on the merits. We agree with the district court's determination and find it unnecessary to address the remaining factors. To this end, we now address the likelihood of success on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PMPA lists several grounds under which a franchisor can choose not to renew a franchise agreement. One such ground is the \"failure of the franchisor and the franchisee to agree to changes or additions to the provisions of the franchise.\" 15 U.S.C. &#167; 2802(b)(3)(A). In negotiating any changes or additions to the franchise agreement, the franchisor must have acted (1) \"in good faith and in the normal course of business\" and (2) not for the purpose of \"preventing the renewal of the franchise relationship.\" <i>Id.</i> Monroig's only argument is that Esso acted in bad faith during the negotiations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The requirement that a franchisor act \"in good faith and in the normal course of business\" is not a stringent one. The test is whether the \"franchisor had acted in subjective good faith in requesting the changes, and not whether the demanded changes were the result of reasonable business judgments.\" <i>Dep't of Consumer Affairs,</i> 793 F.2d at 432 (internal quotation marks omitted). Congress sought to \"provide adequate protection of franchisees from arbitrary or discriminatory termination or nonrenewal, yet avoid judicial scrutiny of the business judgement itself.\" <i>Id.</i> We have found that the \"good faith requirement requires merely that a franchisor not act with evil motive or discriminate selectively against franchisees.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Monroig has not borne his burden to show that Esso did not act in good faith. Monroig speculates that Esso might have violated Puerto Rico regulations that limit the amount of rent that may be charged to gasoline filling stations. Monroig further faults Esso's failure to show that it had complied with these regulations. However, it is Monroig who bears the burden of proof. He could have discovered the necessary information to ascertain whether Esso complied with the regulations but did not do so. He cannot now use such speculation to establish a lack of good faith.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Monroig also points to an apparent clerical error by Esso that was revealed during the preliminary injunction hearing. He characterizes this error as manipulation of data and argues that it is evidence of bad faith. Given that the error was in Monroig's favor and resulted in a lower rent than what he should have been charged, we do not find this error relevant. Monroig also faults Esso for not producing the testimony of the person who discovered the error, but as the district court noted, Monroig made no attempt to call this person as a witness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Monroig urges that Esso's bargaining tactics showed an absence of good faith. He notes that at one point in the negotiations \"Esso took its interest in a rent increase off the table\" only to bring it up again \"four months later when significant progress had been made in the negotiations and an agreement was imminent.\" Such bargaining does not rise to the level of an \"evil motive\" and not even remotely indicative of bad faith. In contrast, the rent increases proposed by Esso were five percent for each of the first two years and zero percent for the final year. In light of the fact that courts have upheld rent increases of 100 to 300 percent, <i>see Dep't of Consumer Affairs,</i> 793 F.2d at 432, Esso's modest request suggests that it negotiated in good faith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Monroig also argues that the district court committed error in applying the common-law standard without giving notice to the parties of its intent to do so. Having only argued the PMPA standard, Monroig claims he was denied the opportunity to fully argue his case before the district court. We find this assertion meritless for three reasons. First, under either standard, Monroig was required to show some level of success on the merits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Thus, his arguments going to the merits would have been the same under either standard. Second, even if we had applied the PMPA standard, we would still have denied the injunction, because Monroig has utterly failed to present any evidence of bad faith on the part of Esso. Finally, Monroig had the opportunity to argue the common-law standard on appeal, and he has not explained how he was prevented from presenting any relevant evidence before the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Monroig's passing reference in his brief to the second requirement is not sufficiently developed to preserve the argument for appeal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We do not make any statement as to whether compliance with the Puerto Rico regulations is relevant to whether Esso acted in good faith</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Under the PMPA standard, Monroig was required to show \"sufficiently serious questions going to the merits,\" 15 U.S.C. &#167; 2805(b)(2), while under the common law standard, he was required to show his likelihood of success on the merits</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Preliminary Injunction Standard</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now address the proper standard for determining whether the preliminary injunction should be granted. Esso urges the common-law standard, <i>see Bl(a)ck Tea Soc'y v. City of Boston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201165\"><a href=\"/opinion/201165/black-tea-society-v-city-of-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">378</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 11 (1st Cir.2004), and Monroig urges the standard outlined in the PMPA, <i>see</i> 15 U.S.C. &#167; 2805(b)(2). The PMPA authorizes a standard for granting preliminary injunctions that is more forgiving than the common law standard, but in order to benefit from this standard, the franchisee must be timely in its request for a preliminary injunction. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 2805(b)(4). The PMPA does not specify what a district court should do if the franchisee is tardy in its request. To determine the proper standard, we must determine whether Monroig was timely and, if not, what the proper course of action should be.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Timeliness</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given our discussion of the notice requirements, above, we have no problem finding that Monroig did not timely seek a preliminary injunction. Pursuant to our determination that Esso gave notice to Monroig on the earliest, reasonably practicable date under &#167; 2804(b)(1), Monroig had 30 days from the nonrenewal to timely request a preliminary injunction. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2805(b)(4)(C). Monroig requested a preliminary injunction on September 9, 2004, which was more than 30 days after the nonrenewal date of June 30, 2004.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Standard for an Untimely Request</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PMPA does not provide much guidance to courts considering an untimely request for a preliminary injunction. The PMPA merely states that \"the court need not exercise its equity powers to compel continuation or renewal of the franchise relationship if such action was [not timely] commenced.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2805(b)(4). No circuit court has yet addressed this issue. The district court below noted that other district courts have taken three different approaches when the franchisee is tardy in seeking equitable relief: (1) \"outright dismissal of the franchisee's claim for equitable relief\"; (2) reliance \"in part upon the franchisee's failure to timely commence an action in denying equitable relief\"; and (3) \"adjudge the request under the common law standard.\" <i>See Esso Std. Oil Co. (P.R.) v. Monroig Zayas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2300255\"><a href=\"/opinion/2300255/esso-standard-oil-co-v-zayas/\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">165</span></a></span>, 171 (D.P.R.2005). The district court found the third option \"to be the better reasoned approach\" and applied the common-law standard. <i>Id.</i> We agree with the district court that this is the proper approach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the absence of the more forgiving preliminary injunction standard described in the PMPA, courts would apply the common-law standard, which does not include any specific time limitations. Congress created the PMPA to rectify \"the disparity of bargaining power existing between franchisors and franchisees.\" <i>Dep't of Consumer Affairs,</i> 793 F.2d at 432. By creating a more forgiving preliminary injunction standard in the PMPA, Congress gave more power to franchisees. We do not think that Congress intended to give with one hand and take away with the other. Applying the common-law standard to untimely requests for injunctions therefore comports well with the underlying purpose of the PMPA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Preliminary Injunction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now apply the common-law standard. We weigh four factors in determining whether a preliminary injunction should be granted:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) the likelihood of success on the merits; (2) the potential for irreparable harm [to the movant] if the injunction is denied; (3) the balance of relevant impositions, i.e., the hardship to the nonmovant if enjoined as contrasted with the hardship to the movant if no injunction issues; and (4) the effect (if any) of the court's ruling on the public interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Bl(a)ck Tea Soc'y,</i> 378 F.3d at 11 (internal quotation marks omitted). The party seeking the preliminary injunction bears the burden of establishing that these four factors weigh in its favor. <i>Nieves-M&#225;rquez v. Puerto Rico,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">353</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">108</span></span>, 120 (1st Cir.2003). \"The sine qua non of this four-part inquiry is likelihood of success on the merits: if the moving party cannot demonstrate that he is likely to succeed in his quest, the remaining factors become matters of idle curiosity.\" <i>New Comm Wireless Servs., Inc. v. SprintCom, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199913\"><a href=\"/opinion/199913/new-comm-wireless-v-sprint/\"><span class=\"volume\">287</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 9 (1st Cir.2002). The district court denied the preliminary injunction, and we review for abuse of discretion. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court addressed only the first factor, finding that Monroig had not shown a substantial likelihood of success on the merits. We agree with the district court's determination and find it unnecessary to address the remaining factors. To this end, we now address the likelihood of success on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PMPA lists several grounds under which a franchisor can choose not to renew a franchise agreement. One such ground is the \"failure of the franchisor and the franchisee to agree to changes or additions to the provisions of the franchise.\" 15 U.S.C. &#167; 2802(b)(3)(A). In negotiating any changes or additions to the franchise agreement, the franchisor must have acted (1) \"in good faith and in the normal course of business\" and (2) not for the purpose of \"preventing the renewal of the franchise relationship.\" <i>Id.</i> Monroig's only argument is that Esso acted in bad faith during the negotiations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The requirement that a franchisor act \"in good faith and in the normal course of business\" is not a stringent one. The test is whether the \"franchisor had acted in subjective good faith in requesting the changes, and not whether the demanded changes were the result of reasonable business judgments.\" <i>Dep't of Consumer Affairs,</i> 793 F.2d at 432 (internal quotation marks omitted). Congress sought to \"provide adequate protection of franchisees from arbitrary or discriminatory termination or nonrenewal, yet avoid judicial scrutiny of the business judgement itself.\" <i>Id.</i> We have found that the \"good faith requirement requires merely that a franchisor not act with evil motive or discriminate selectively against franchisees.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Monroig has not borne his burden to show that Esso did not act in good faith. Monroig speculates that Esso might have violated Puerto Rico regulations that limit the amount of rent that may be charged to gasoline filling stations. Monroig further faults Esso's failure to show that it had complied with these regulations. However, it is Monroig who bears the burden of proof. He could have discovered the necessary information to ascertain whether Esso complied with the regulations but did not do so. He cannot now use such speculation to establish a lack of good faith.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Monroig also points to an apparent clerical error by Esso that was revealed during the preliminary injunction hearing. He characterizes this error as manipulation of data and argues that it is evidence of bad faith. Given that the error was in Monroig's favor and resulted in a lower rent than what he should have been charged, we do not find this error relevant. Monroig also faults Esso for not producing the testimony of the person who discovered the error, but as the district court noted, Monroig made no attempt to call this person as a witness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Monroig urges that Esso's bargaining tactics showed an absence of good faith. He notes that at one point in the negotiations \"Esso took its interest in a rent increase off the table\" only to bring it up again \"four months later when significant progress had been made in the negotiations and an agreement was imminent.\" Such bargaining does not rise to the level of an \"evil motive\" and not even remotely indicative of bad faith. In contrast, the rent increases proposed by Esso were five percent for each of the first two years and zero percent for the final year. In light of the fact that courts have upheld rent increases of 100 to 300 percent, <i>see Dep't of Consumer Affairs,</i> 793 F.2d at 432, Esso's modest request suggests that it negotiated in good faith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Monroig also argues that the district court committed error in applying the common-law standard without giving notice to the parties of its intent to do so. Having only argued the PMPA standard, Monroig claims he was denied the opportunity to fully argue his case before the district court. We find this assertion meritless for three reasons. First, under either standard, Monroig was required to show some level of success on the merits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Thus, his arguments going to the merits would have been the same under either standard. Second, even if we had applied the PMPA standard, we would still have denied the injunction, because Monroig has utterly failed to present any evidence of bad faith on the part of Esso. Finally, Monroig had the opportunity to argue the common-law standard on appeal, and he has not explained how he was prevented from presenting any relevant evidence before the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Monroig's passing reference in his brief to the second requirement is not sufficiently developed to preserve the argument for appeal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We do not make any statement as to whether compliance with the Puerto Rico regulations is relevant to whether Esso acted in good faith</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Under the PMPA standard, Monroig was required to show \"sufficiently serious questions going to the merits,\" 15 U.S.C. &#167; 2805(b)(2), while under the common law standard, he was required to show his likelihood of success on the merits</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
