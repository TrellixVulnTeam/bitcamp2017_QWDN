Pro se petitioner Joseph Pope appeals a district\n\ncourt order that denied his claims for habeas relief.                                 See 28\n\nU.S.C. ยง 2254.           The court thereafter issued a certificate of\n\nappealability         with    respect        to     the    petitioner's       ineffective\n\nassistance       of   trial       and   appellate          counsel    claims.         Having\n\nthoroughly reviewed the record and the parties' briefs on appeal,\n\nwe    agree   that     petitioner       is    not     entitled       to    habeas    relief,\n\nsubstantially for the reasons stated by the district court.                              The\n\nrecord shows that defense counsel's advice that petitioner should\n\nnot testify was a reasonable strategic choice, and petitioner has\n\nfailed to overcome the presumption of correctness that attaches to\n\nthe    finding    that       he   validly         waived    his   right      to     testify.1\n\nPetitioner has failed to show that the Supreme Judicial Court's\n\ndecision rejecting his claim that his trial counsel rendered\n\nineffective assistance by failing to object to the trial court's\n\ninstructions concerning the petitioner's right to remain silent was\n\ncontrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established\n\nfederal law as determined by the Supreme Court.                           The petitioner's\n\nremaining claims fail, either because they are meritless or because\n\nthey are procedurally defaulted and petitioner has failed to make\n\nthe showing required to excuse his default.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n        Petitioner implies that his waiver cannot be valid absent\na colloquy with the trial judge.
