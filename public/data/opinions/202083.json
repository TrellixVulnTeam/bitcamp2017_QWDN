On September 27, 2000, a grand\n\njury   sitting    in    Boston,    Massachusetts        returned     an   indictment\n\ncharging Gary P. DeCicco (\"appellant\") with four counts of mail\n\nfraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1341, in connection with claims\n\nfor insurance proceeds submitted in the wake of two 1995 fires\n\n(Counts 1-4), and two counts of use of fire to commit a felony, in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 844(h)(1) & (2) (Counts 5-6).                      Although\n\nDeCicco was eventually acquitted on the use-of-fire counts, he was\n\nconvicted on the four mail fraud counts.                    He now appeals this\n\nconviction.      After careful consideration, we affirm.\n\n                                  I.   Background\n\n                                         A.\n\n           In August 1989, DeCicco bought a building located at 17\n\nRear Heard Street in Chelsea, Massachusetts for $60,000.                     Earlier\n\nthat year, before buying the building, he had applied to the City\n\nof Chelsea (\"Chelsea\") for a permit to use the building as a\n\nwarehouse for two moving companies that he owned.                    The building,\n\nhowever, was surrounded by residential buildings and had only a\n\nnarrow driveway providing access.                  Chelsea therefore denied the\n\nappellant's application.\n\n           DeCicco       nonetheless        went    ahead   with    the   purchase.\n\nAlthough the building price was only $60,000, he obtained a loan of\n\n$104,000 from Somerset Bank, secured by a mortgage on the property.\n\nNotwithstanding        the   denial    of    the    occupancy      permit,    DeCicco\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\finitially tried to use the building as a warehouse.                  He was,\n\nhowever, prevented from doing so by Chelsea.           As a result, he ended\n\nup with a significant mortgage on a building he could not use for\n\nthe purpose he desired.      By August 1991, he was in arrears on the\n\nmortgage, and Somerset Bank informed him that it was intending to\n\ninitiate foreclosure proceedings.          Moreover, the appellant had two\n\nother obligations to Somerset Bank by this time: a $400,000 loan\n\nused to build a new warehouse in Revere, Massachusetts (\"Revere\"),\n\nand a short-term, $80,000 commercial loan.               The appellant was\n\nfalling behind on the Revere loan as well.\n\n          In October 1991, DeCicco obtained insurance on the Rear\n\nHeard   Street    building    from    the    Lincoln     Insurance   Company\n\n(\"Lincoln\").     However, he misrepresented that the premises were\n\noccupied, and after this fact was discovered upon inspection,\n\nLincoln, on March 3, 1992, sent a cancellation notice by certified\n\nmail to the appellant.       The notice advised the appellant that his\n\ninsurance policy would be cancelled effective March 13, 1992 at\n\n12:01 a.m.\n\n          Just twenty-nine hours before the insurance was to lapse,\n\na fire occurred at the Rear Heard Street building.            Investigators\n\ndetermined that the fire was intentionally set using a liquid\n\naccelerant at the base of the support pillars in a manner designed\n\nto bring the building down. The Fire Department responded quickly,\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fhowever, and such little damage occurred that the appellant did not\n\nfile a claim.\n\n              Following the cancellation of the Lincoln policy, the\n\nRear Heard Street building went for three years without insurance.\n\nAt some point during this period, the appellant retained Richard\n\nStewart (\"Stewart\"), an accountant, to help him prepare income tax\n\nreturns for the years 1992, 1993, and 1994.               In December 1994,\n\nStewart informed the appellant that, based on the information\n\navailable to him and the draft returns he had prepared, the\n\nappellant owed $1,246,298 in federal and state taxes and penalties\n\nfor   1992,    1993,   and   1994.   The    draft   returns   reflected   some\n\ndeductions for expenses, but they did not reflect deductions for\n\nsuch business expenses as payroll. Based on Stewart's training and\n\nexperience, he estimated that the appellant's tax liability might\n\nhave been reduced by as much as ninety percent if the appellant had\n\ndocumentation for these expenses.\n\n              Aside from his significant personal income tax liability,\n\nDeCicco also continued to have other financial issues during this\n\nperiod. He owed a total of $65,673.56 to Revere in property taxes.\n\nHe was also in significant arrears on property taxes for the Rear\n\nHeard Street building in Chelsea.          By July 1995, the amount he owed\n\nto Chelsea had ballooned to approximately $12,000.               Finally, he\n\nstill owed almost $95,000 to Somerset Bank in connection with the\n\nloan used to purchase the Rear Heard Street building, which was\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fessentially vacant, and which he was expressly forbidden to use in\n\nconnection with his moving companies.\n\n           In May 1995, facing all of these financial pressures,\n\nDeCicco once again attempted to obtain insurance on the Rear Heard\n\nStreet building. On May 17, 1995, the Scottsdale Insurance Company\n\n(\"Scottsdale\") issued the appellant an insurance policy providing\n\ncoverage of up to $125,000 for the building.\n\n           Less than two months later, on July 9, 1995, the building\n\nwas intentionally set on fire for a second time, with at least four\n\nseparate fires started on the second floor of the warehouse.             The\n\nFire   Department    again   responded   quickly,   and    the   fires   were\n\nextinguished.    However, twelve days later, on July 21, 1995, a\n\nthird fire was intentionally set in the building in the early\n\nmorning hours.      This was a multiple-alarm fire, requiring Chelsea\n\nto call for aid from Revere, Everett, and Boston to fight the fire.\n\nIt took approximately four hours to extinguish the blaze.            In the\n\nend, the building was completely destroyed.         The fire also damaged\n\na neighboring garage; melted the siding on a nearby building; and\n\ndestroyed the kitchen, bathroom, and pantry on the third floor of\n\nanother building.\n\n           Given the extensive damage, Chelsea ordered the appellant\n\nto demolish what was left of the building.           The appellant asked\n\nKevin Mahoney (\"Mahoney\") to perform the work.            Mahoney discussed\n\nthe matter with his cousin, Randy Adamson, and then agreed to\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fdemolish the building for $13,800, a price that the appellant\n\naccepted.       Mahoney and Adamson, using helpers and equipment,\n\ndemolished the building and removed the rubble in approximately six\n\ndays.    The appellant paid Mahoney with an initial check of $4,000\n\nand then later paid the remaining $9,800.\n\n              DeCicco then sought the assistance of a public claims\n\nadjustor, Terence Lynn (\"Lynn\"), to assist in filing his claim with\n\nScottsdale, to recover pursuant to the insurance policy for the\n\ndestruction of the building.          However, almost immediately a number\n\nof points of contention arose between the appellant and Scottsdale.\n\nIn early September 1995, in a communication between Lynn and\n\nScottsdale     regarding       the   appellant's       claim,   an    issue     arose\n\nregarding whether the building was vacant at the time of the fire.\n\nThis    was   important,       because   according      to   the     terms     of   the\n\nScottsdale policy, recovery for a fire loss could be reduced by\n\nfifteen percent if the building was vacant when the fire occurred.\n\nOn September 19, 1995, as this issue regarding vacancy was pending,\n\nthe appellant's insurance broker, Justin Kaan, faxed to Lynn a\n\ndocument signed by the appellant and purporting to set forth\n\ncertain items that were in the warehouse at the time of the fire,\n\nincluding     dollies,     a    piano,   a     desk,    chairs,      and   a   couch.\n\nScottsdale's fire investigator, however, saw no evidence of dollies\n\nor a piano when he examined the remains of the building after the\n\nfire.\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\f           There were other controversies as well. On September 20,\n\n1995, Lynn sent a letter to Scottsdale's representative, John\n\nBottini (\"Bottini\").   Lynn wrote that \"I have enclosed a copy of\n\nthe wrecking bill in the amount of $23,681, which was performed as\n\na result of an emergency raze or repair order issued by the\n\nmunicipality shortly after the occurrence of the loss.\"         The\n\nenclosed demolition bill purported to bear the signature of Arthur\n\nAdamson.   However, according to Mahoney, who actually did the\n\ndemolition work with Randy Adamson, DeCicco only paid $13,800, the\n\nagreed-upon price for the work.     Furthermore, both Randy Adamson\n\nand his mother stated that the signature on the demolition bill\n\nsubmitted to Bottini was not that of Arthur Adamson (who died in\n\n1997), nor was the bill on his letterhead.\n\n           On October 17, 1995, Lynn mailed to Bottini another\n\nletter in which he again mentioned the $23,681 demolition bill.\n\nIncluded with this letter was the partial sworn statement in proof\n\nof loss referenced in Count 1 of the indictment and a request for\n\nan advance payment of $25,000.    In an attempt to get Scottsdale to\n\nissue this advance payment, Lynn's letter stated, among other\n\nthings: \"We both know that Massachusetts is a so-called broad\n\nevidence rule state.   The disagreements as to value and loss are\n\nstill subject to indemnification of the insured whose indebtedness\n\nto the mortgagee as of this date of loss was $97,016.29 and who has\n\nincurred a wrecking bill of $23,681.\"         Scottsdale thereafter\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fforwarded Lynn a $25,000 check -- the Count 2 mailing -- which Lynn\n\nsent to Somerset Bank, which was named as a loss payee because of\n\nits mortgage on the property.\n\n            On    January    2,    1996,    Lynn      sent   a   letter    to   Bottini\n\nenclosing a proposed sworn statement in proof of loss seeking to\n\nachieve a final settlement of the losses and again noting, among\n\nother things, that \"the incurred cost of wrecking the structure was\n\n$23,681 . . . .\"            Lynn also claimed in this letter that the\n\nappellant had made extensive renovations to the building, including\n\ninstallation of a hot air heating system, an electrical system, a\n\ntwo-piece bath, a new roof, skylights, and a $10,000 power lift.\n\nHowever, the appellant had told Bottini shortly after the fire that\n\nthe warehouse had had neither heat nor electricity.                       Furthermore,\n\nScottsdale's fire investigator saw no evidence of a power lift and\n\nnoted that neither the heating system nor the electrical system had\n\nbeen operational at the time of the fire.                        Bottini was never\n\nprovided   with    any   documentation           to   support    DeCicco's      claimed\n\nimprovements.      He rejected the proposed proof of loss.\n\n            Bottini and Lynn eventually negotiated a settlement, and\n\non February 7, 1996, Lynn sent Bottini a letter -- the Count 3\n\nmailing    --    containing    a    sworn    proof      of   loss   reflecting     the\n\nsettlement figures of $95,283 for the building and $23,681 for the\n\ndemolition, for a total of $118,964.                  Bottini states that had he\n\nknown that the actual cost of the demolition was less than $23,681,\n\n\n                                           -8-\n\fhe would not have agreed to the final settlement amount, and had\n\nScottsdale been aware that the actual amount incurred was less, it\n\nwould not have paid that amount.          Bottini, however, acknowledged\n\nthat $23,681 was a fair figure for the demolition, given the\n\nbuilding's size.\n\n            On February 27, 1996, Scottsdale sent a check to Lynn in\n\nthe amount of $91,964 -- the Count 4 mailing -- the settlement\n\namount   minus   two   $1,000   deductibles   and   the   $25,000   advance\n\npayment. That check listed as payees DeCicco, Lynn, Somerset Bank,\n\nand Chelsea.1    DeCicco took the check to a bank and deposited it.\n\nAlthough it appeared that the check had been endorsed by each of\n\nthe payees, the endorsements of both Joseph Bianco on behalf of\n\nSomerset Bank and Alicia Silverberg on behalf of Chelsea were\n\nforged; indeed, no one named Alicia Silverberg had ever worked for\n\nthe Chelsea City Treasurer's Office.        Somerset Bank did ultimately\n\nreceive insurance proceeds in the form of a Bank of Boston check\n\nfrom the appellant in the amount of $92,500, which satisfied the\n\nmortgage on the Rear Heard Street building in full.                 Bianco\n\nunderstood that this payment represented the Scottsdale insurance\n\nproceeds.    Chelsea, however, never received payment for the real\n\nestate taxes.\n\n\n\n\n1\n   At the time of the fire, Chelsea was owed between $12,000 and\n$16,000 in real estate taxes. It had priority of payment from the\ninsurance proceeds.\n\n                                    -9-\n\f                                           B.\n\n            On September 27, 2000, the grand jury sitting in Boston\n\nreturned its indictment, charging the appellant with four counts of\n\nmail fraud, and two counts of use of fire to commit a felony.                  With\n\nrespect to the four mail fraud counts, the indictment alleged in\n\none paragraph (paragraph 5) that DeCicco caused the destruction of\n\nthe   warehouse   by    fire.        It   alleged   in   a   separate   paragraph\n\n(paragraph 4) that \"following the damage by fire . . . [DeCicco]\n\nwould and did cause the submission . . . of false and fraudulent\n\nclaims for building loss insurance proceeds.\"                   The language of\n\nparagraph 4 does not make the alleged falsity of DeCicco's claims\n\nconditional upon any other acts on his part, nor does it specify\n\nthat the claims were false for a certain reason.                  Paragraph 4 is\n\ntherefore   broad      enough   to    support    not     just   the   theory   that\n\nDeCicco's claims were fraudulent because he caused the fire, but\n\nalso the theory that his claims were fraudulent for independent\n\nreasons, regardless of how the fire may have started.                   The other\n\ntwo counts, regarding use of fire to commit a felony, charged the\n\nappellant with violations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 844(h)(1) & (2) based on\n\nthe fires that occurred at the Rear Heard Street building on\n\nJuly 9, 1995 and July 21, 1995.\n\n            On April 14, 2003, prior to trial, the district court\n\ngranted the appellant's motion to exclude evidence, pursuant to\n\nFed. R. Evid. 403 and 404(b), regarding (1) the March 1992 fire\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\fthat occurred at the same property involved in the indicted counts,\n\nand (2) testimony of Stewart, DeCicco's accountant, regarding\n\nDeCicco's income tax liabilities.      The government appealed from\n\nthis ruling, and this Court reversed the district court's exclusion\n\nof the evidence.   See United States v. DeCicco, 370 F.3d 206 (1st\n\nCir. 2004) (\"DeCicco I\").\n\n          The case proceeded to trial on November 8, 2004.   One of\n\nthe government's key witnesses was the accountant Stewart, who\n\ntestified not only about the amount of DeCicco's tax liability --\n\nthe issue before this Court on the prior appeal -- but also about\n\nthe fact that Stewart had sought additional documentation from\n\nDeCicco to support claimed deductions which would have reduced\n\nDeCicco's tax liability.     DeCicco objected to this additional\n\ntestimony by Stewart.   The district court, however, ruled that the\n\ntestimony was admissible.\n\n          At the conclusion of the government's evidence, DeCicco\n\nmade a motion, pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 29, that there was\n\ninsufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find him guilty\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, particularly as to the use-of-fire\n\ncounts.   The district court granted the appellant's motion for a\n\nrequired finding of not guilty as to one of the counts charging the\n\nappellant with use of fire to commit a felony but denied the motion\n\nas to the mail fraud counts and the other count charging use of\n\nfire to commit a felony.\n\n\n                                -11-\n\f           When the appellant put on his case, he called several\n\nwitnesses, including Terence Lynn, the public claims adjustor, and\n\nLawrence   Maddeford,   who   lived   next   to   the   Rear   Heard   Street\n\nbuilding. Maddeford observed that kids would hang out at the\n\nbuilding all the time, breaking through the boarded-up windows to\n\ngain access.     Despite Maddeford registering numerous complaints\n\nwith the police, the building essentially became a clubhouse for\n\nthe kids for several years. After the fire destroyed the building,\n\nthat was the end of the clubhouse.\n\n           At the conclusion of DeCicco's case, he renewed his Rule\n\n29 motion.     The district court entertained argument on the issue\n\nagain, noting that although it had denied the motion with respect\n\nto Count Six (the remaining use-of-fire count), it would \"like the\n\ngovernment's argument, in view of the fact there appears to be a\n\nwitness [Maddeford] -- seems to me a very credible witness -- who\n\nraised a great doubt as to whether or not these what you call\n\nvagrants or kids constituted a nuisance did, in fact, cause the\n\nfire.\"   After argument, the district court granted the appellant's\n\nmotion for a required finding of not guilty as to the other count\n\ncharging use of fire to commit a felony.          The court also issued an\n\norder to the parties that they were not to argue to the jury during\n\nclosing arguments that the appellant was, or was not, responsible\n\nfor the fires.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\f             On November 17, 2004, the jury found the appellant guilty\n\non all four remaining mail fraud counts.           The district court\n\nsentenced DeCicco to two years of probation, a $7,500 fine, and\n\nrestitution of $9,881. It is this conviction that he appeals here.\n\n       II.   Constructive amendment and material variance claims\n\n             DeCicco's first claim is that there was a constructive\n\namendment of his indictment, or alternatively, that there was a\n\nmaterial variance between the indictment and proof that affected\n\nhis substantial rights.       In United States v. Fisher, 3 F.3d 456\n\n(1st    Cir.    1993),   we   described   the   difference   between   a\n\n\"constructive amendment\" and a \"material variance\":\n\n             A constructive amendment occurs when the\n             charging terms of the indictment are altered,\n             either literally or in effect, by prosecution\n             or court after the grand jury has last passed\n             upon them.     A variance occurs when the\n             charging terms remain unchanged but when the\n             facts proved at trial are different from those\n             alleged in the indictment.

Arcadipane, 41 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1994)\n\n(variance requires reversal of a conviction \"if it is both material\n\nand prejudicial\").\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\f                             A.   Standard of review\n\n           In   assessing         DeCicco's   \"constructive         amendment\"   and\n\n\"material variance\" claims, we must first determine the appropriate\n\nstandard of review. The appellant claims that because these issues\n\nwere preserved through his objections at trial, de novo review is\n\nappropriate.      The    government      argues       in   opposition    that    the\n\nappellant made no such objections; as a result, we should review\n\nfor \"plain error.\"      See United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 731\n\n(1993).2\n\n           In the district court, DeCicco twice moved for judgments\n\nof acquittal, arguing that there was insufficient evidence that he\n\nwas responsible for the fires to permit the use-of-fire counts to\n\ngo to the jury and that \"the other counts are conditioned upon a\n\nfinding of guilt on Counts 5 and 6 [the use-of-fire counts] in\n\nterms of using the fire to actually commit the . . . mail fraud\n\ncounts . . . .\"         At two different points -- both after the\n\nconclusion of the government's case and after the conclusion of the\n\nappellant's     case    --    the    district     court      made    apparent    its\n\ndisagreement with such a proposition, based on its assessment that\n\nDeCicco could be guilty of mail fraud, even if he were not\n\nresponsible for the fires, if he simply took advantage of the fires\n\nby   submitting    an    inflated      bill     for    the    demolition    costs.\n\n\n\n2\n   The appellant does concede that if de novo review does not\napply, \"plain error\" is the proper standard of review.\n\n                                       -14-\n\fNevertheless, DeCicco argues here that these motions sufficed to\n\npreserve    his    objection     that   the     district      court   would    be\n\nconstructively amending the indictment if it allowed him to be\n\ntried for a scheme to defraud other than the one charged in the\n\nindictment, namely, a scheme to cause the destruction of the Rear\n\nHeard Street building by fire in order to fraudulently claim\n\ninsurance proceeds for the loss of the building.                He also states\n\nthat these motions were sufficient to preserve his objection that\n\nthe district court was effecting a material variance between\n\nindictment and proof that affected his substantial rights.\n\n            We fail to see, however, how the motions cited by DeCicco\n\ncan be deemed \"constructive amendment\" or \"material variance\"\n\nobjections.       Despite his attempt to spin them that way, the\n\narguments   he    made   in   support   of    his   motions    were   merely   an\n\narticulation of his view that no charges would survive if the\n\ndistrict court granted the motions, particularly with regard to the\n\nuse-of-fire counts.       Moreover, after the district court clearly\n\nstated its belief -- twice -- that the indictment comprehended the\n\ntheory that the appellant had taken advantage of the fires by\n\nsubmitting false insurance claims, the appellant interposed no\n\nobjection or argument that this would constitute a \"constructive\n\namendment\" of the indictment or a \"material variance\" between\n\nindictment and proof.         Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 51(b), a party may\n\npreserve a claim of error by informing the court -- when the court\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fruling or order is made or sought -- of the party's objection to\n\nthe court's action and the grounds for that objection.         Here,\n\nhowever, the appellant took no such action.3\n\n            In light of these facts, we believe that DeCicco did not\n\npreserve his objections and that the \"plain error\" test should\n\napply in this instance.     Under this standard, there must have been\n\nan error, the error must have been \"plain,\" and the error must have\n\naffected the substantial rights of the appellant.     See Olano, 507\n\nU.S. at 732.      If all three elements are satisfied, we have the\n\nauthority to order correction of the error, but we are not required\n\nto do so.    Id. at 735.   We exercise this discretion only where the\n\nplain error \"seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public\n\nreputation of judicial proceedings.\" Id. at 736 (internal citation\n\nand quotation marks omitted).\n\n                      B.   Constructive amendment\n\n            The appellant makes two separate \"constructive amendment\"\n\nclaims.     First, he reads the indictment to include one theory and\n\none theory only: that he had devised a scheme to submit insurance\n\n\n3\n   In his reply brief, the appellant admits as much. He concedes\nthat his trial counsel did not use the term \"constructive\namendment.\" He also notes that when he responded \"Okay\" after the\ndistrict court had handed down its ruling that there could still be\na mail fraud even absent the use-of-fire counts, he was simply\nacknowledging the court's position, not acquiescing in its\ncorrectness. This may be true, but however he characterizes his\nresponse, it was not sufficient to preserve his claim of error\nunder the standard in Fed. R. Crim. P. 51(b). In the end, as we\nshall discuss, even had counsel preserved the objection, there was\nno error.\n\n                                  -16-\n\fclaims to Scottsdale which were false and fraudulent because he\n\ncaused the fires (i.e., as the one who started the fires, he was\n\nnot entitled to any recovery).       However, he notes that after the\n\ndistrict court ruled that the government had presented insufficient\n\nevidence that DeCicco was responsible for the fires, the government\n\nshifted its theory in its closing arguments to discuss how the\n\nappellant had devised a scheme to submit insurance claims to\n\nScottsdale which were false and fraudulent for reasons entirely\n\nindependent of whether he caused the fires. When the government\n\nmade this shift, he argues, it impermissibly broadened the possible\n\nbases for conviction beyond those set forth in the indictment\n\nreturned by the grand jury.         This shift in theory, from one in\n\nwhich DeCicco's responsibility for the fires was an essential\n\ncomponent   of   the   fraudulent   scheme   to   one   in   which   it   was\n\nunnecessary, constituted a constructive amendment of the indictment\n\nin violation of the Fifth Amendment Grand Jury clause.          This shift\n\nbroadened the scheme charged in the indictment because it permitted\n\nhis conviction to rest on claims for insurance proceeds which were\n\nfraudulent for any reason, not just because DeCicco was responsible\n\nfor the fires.\n\n            The appellant, however, misreads the indictment. He is\n\nincorrect in maintaining that the indictment did not encompass\n\nclaims for insurance proceeds that were fraudulent for reasons\n\nother than that he had caused the fires.          The indictment alleged,\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fin two separate and distinct paragraphs, two separate and distinct\n\nways in which the appellant perpetrated mail fraud: (1) by causing\n\nthe submission to Scottsdale of false and fraudulent claims for\n\nbuilding loss insurance proceeds, and (2) by actually causing the\n\ndamage to and destruction of the Rear Heard Street building by\n\nfire. In other words, the indictment contained two completely\n\nseparate theories.        In the first theory, DeCicco committed mail\n\nfraud    because   he    submitted    false    and    fraudulent      claims   for\n\ninsurance proceeds after the fire, however it may have started. In\n\nthe   second   theory,    the   appellant     committed       mail   fraud   for   a\n\ndifferent reason.        The claims that he submitted were false and\n\nfraudulent because he caused the fire (and therefore was not\n\nentitled to any recovery).\n\n            Accordingly, the mail fraud counts of the indictment were\n\nnot dependent on the theory that the appellant had caused the\n\nfires.    Instead, they were so fashioned as to comprehend that one\n\ncould take advantage of a fire and commit mail fraud even without\n\nhaving    caused   the     fire.     In   other      words,    the    appellant's\n\nmisrepresentations -- for example, in the fraudulent demolition\n\nbill or in the phony list of property in the warehouse at the time\n\nof the fire or in the letter sent by Lynn to Bottini listing\n\nimprovements made to the property by DeCicco -- could be used to\n\nshow he committed mail fraud, regardless of whether he started the\n\nfires.    As such, when the government made the shift complained of\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\fby the appellant, the government was not exceeding the scope of the\n\nindictment but was merely operating with its confines.\n\n          Both parties point to the Supreme Court's decision in\n\nUnited States v. Miller, 471 U.S. 130 (1985), to support their\n\nrespective positions. We think Miller clearly shows that there was\n\nno \"constructive amendment\" in this case. In Miller, the defendant\n\nwas convicted of two counts of mail fraud, in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1341.       The indictment in the case alleged a scheme to\n\ndefraud with two distinct components; specifically, the indictment\n\nalleged both that the defendant had defrauded his insurer by\n\nconsenting to a burglary in advance and by then lying to the\n\ninsurer regarding the amount of copper wire which was stolen during\n\nthat burglary.       The trial evidence, however, went only to the\n\nallegation that the defendant had lied regarding his copper-wire\n\nclaim.   The       government    moved    to   strike    the   portion   of   the\n\nindictment    that    alleged    the   defendant's      pre-knowledge    of   the\n\nburglary, but, when the defendant opposed that motion, the entire\n\nindictment went to the jury.           The defendant was convicted, and on\n\nappeal, complained that both prongs of his indictment were not\n\nsatisfied.\n\n          The Supreme Court affirmed Miller's conviction, finding\n\nthat the pre-knowledge of the burglary in Miller's indictment\n\nconstituted    a    segregable    component     of   the   charged   scheme    to\n\ndefraud, and that the evidence presented regarding the inflated\n\n\n                                       -19-\n\fcopper-wire claim was sufficient to support a conviction.                            The\n\nCourt    noted     that    nothing    new     was    added    to    the   grand   jury's\n\nindictment and that \"Miller was tried on an indictment that clearly\n\nset   out    the    offense    for    which    he    was     ultimately     convicted.\"\n\nMiller, 471 U.S. at 140.\n\n              In the present case, the indictment similarly contains\n\ntwo distinct and segregable components.                    As we have demonstrated\n\nabove,      and    contrary    to     the    appellant's       assertion     that    the\n\nindictment        in   this    case     \"did       not    specify     any    separable,\n\nindependently fraudulent scheme on which conviction based on a\n\nnarrower scheme than that charged in the indictment might validly\n\nrest,\" the indictment at issue here alleged two separate and\n\ndistinct ways in which the appellant perpetrated mail fraud,\n\nneither of which was dependent on the other.                          And just as in\n\nMiller, where the removal of the allegation of complicity in the\n\nburglary resulted in a permissible narrowing of the indictment,\n\nleaving intact the theory that the defendant had submitted inflated\n\ninsurance claims, so too could the deletion of the allegation of\n\ncomplicity in the fires here result in a permissible narrowing of\n\nthe   indictment,         leaving    intact    the       separate   theory    that   the\n\nappellant had submitted claims that were false and fraudulent for\n\nreasons unrelated to whether he had started the fires.\n\n              DeCicco's second \"constructive amendment\" claim is as\n\nfollows: The indictment charged him with submitting false and\n\n\n                                            -20-\n\ffraudulent claims for building loss insurance proceeds, but the\n\ncenterpiece of the government's argument to the jury urging it to\n\nconvict DeCicco of mail fraud was not a false and fraudulent claim\n\nfor building loss insurance proceeds at all -- it was a claim for\n\nreimbursement        for     demolition        expenses       which    the     government\n\ncontended was falsely inflated.                DeCicco supports his argument by\n\npointing   to    how       the    Scottsdale        insurance    settlement        had   two\n\nindependent components: one amount for the loss of the building,\n\nand   another    amount      for      the    demolition      costs.      The       two   were\n\ncompletely separate.             He similarly notes how the Scottsdale policy\n\nexpressly differentiates between building loss and debris removal.\n\nIn his eyes, the government's reliance on the demolition bill\n\ncreated the strong possibility that he was convicted of an offense\n\nother   than    that   charged         by    the    grand    jury.    This,    therefore,\n\nconstituted a constructive amendment of the indictment.\n\n           We, however, do not find this argument convincing.                            The\n\nindictment      is   not     tied     to     any    particular       provision      of    the\n\nsettlement agreement or the Scottsdale policy.                         As a result, we\n\nbelieve that the grand jury, when issuing its indictment, was\n\nspeaking generically about \"building loss\" and was not using the\n\nspecific   definition            of   that    phrase    as    provided       for    in    the\n\nsettlement agreement or the Scottsdale policy.                        We also think it\n\ninconceivable that the grand jury in this instance would issue an\n\nindictment limited only to \"building loss\" proceeds, as that term\n\n\n                                             -21-\n\fwas used in the settlement agreement or the Scottsdale policy, when\n\nthere was ample evidence that the appellant had also submitted\n\nfalse and fraudulent claims relating to \"demolition\" or \"debris\n\nremoval\" expenses, as those terms were used in the settlement\n\nagreement and the Scottsdale policy.\n\n            We find, therefore, that there was no \"constructive\n\namendment\" of the indictment in this instance.               Since there was no\n\nerror,   appellant      cannot    possibly      satisfy     the    \"plain    error\"\n\nstandard.\n\n                           C.    Material variance\n\n            Even   if    there    was    no    constructive       amendment,     the\n\nappellant argues that there was, at a minimum, a material variance\n\nbetween indictment and proof.           In this iteration of his argument,\n\nappellant concedes that the charging terms of the indictment are\n\nnot in dispute.     However, he claims that the facts proved at trial\n\nwere different from those alleged in the indictment.                 In his view,\n\nthe indictment alleged facts relating to one theory -- namely, that\n\nhis insurance claims were false and fraudulent because he had\n\ncaused the fires to occur.         The facts presented at trial, however,\n\nrelated to another theory -- that his insurance claims were false\n\nand fraudulent because he had submitted false documentation in\n\nsupport of his claims.          This was a variance, and it was one that\n\naffected    his    \"substantial     rights\"      in   two    ways:    1)    he   had\n\ninsufficient notice to be able to prepare an effective defense to\n\n\n                                        -22-\n\fthe new theory which the government argued to the jury; and 2) he\n\nwas prejudiced by the continuing use of evidence which had been\n\nadmitted solely because it was relevant to the use-of-fire counts.4\n\n            This claim, however, fails at its foundation.                   Once\n\nagain, the appellant misconstrues the indictment.                As we related\n\nabove,    the    indictment   clearly   comprehended       the    theory   that\n\nDeCicco's insurance claims were false and fraudulent for reasons\n\nunrelated to whether he had caused the fires.          In particular, they\n\nwere     false   and   fraudulent   because   he     had   submitted       false\n\ndocumentation in support of his claims.            The sworn statements in\n\nproof of loss and the insurance settlement checks discussed in the\n\nindictment clearly related to this theory.            Moreover, the facts\n\nthat were presented at trial related to this theory.              For example,\n\nfacts were presented that he had provided a false demolition bill,\n\nthat he had provided a phony list of property in the warehouse at\n\nthe time of the fire, and that he had falsely listed improvements\n\nmade to     the property in the letter sent to Bottini.                    These\n\nfalsities all led to the fraudulent sworn statements in proof of\n\n\n4\n   As the government correctly points out, this second argument is\nnot an argument that the appellant purportedly was prejudiced by a\nvariance, but rather an argument that he was prejudiced by the\nadmission of certain evidence. However, prejudice resulting from\nthe admission of certain evidence is not what was meant by\ncompromising \"substantial rights\" in the \"material variance\"\ncontext. See United States v. Tormos-Vega, 959 F.2d 1103, 1115\n(1st Cir. 1992) (\"Substantial rights\" refers to the rights of a\ndefendant to \"have sufficient knowledge of the charge against him\nin order to prepare an effective defense and avoid surprise at\ntrial, and to prevent a second prosecution for the same offense.\").\n\n                                    -23-\n\floss referenced in the indictment and were what prompted the\n\ninsurance settlement checks sent by Scottsdale that were also\n\nreferenced in the indictment. Thus, the facts proved at trial were\n\nnot different from those alleged in the indictment, and there was\n\nno variance.    Since there was no variance, we do not reach the\n\nquestion of whether such an alleged variance was material or\n\nwhether the appellant's substantial rights were affected.\n\n     III.    Potential violation of the district court's order\n\n            The appellant next argues that the government committed\n\nreversible misconduct in its closing arguments to the jury. Before\n\nthe closing arguments commenced, the district court instructed the\n\nparties that they were not to argue to the jury that DeCicco was,\n\nor was not, responsible for the fires.    The appellant here argues\n\nthat the government violated this order when it explicitly argued\n\nto the jury that DeCicco had a motive to want the building gone.\n\nSuch an argument, contends the appellant, the jury could only have\n\ninterpreted as suggesting DeCicco's responsibility for the fires.\n\nAppellant, in particular, points to the following statements by the\n\ngovernment during closing arguments:\n\n            Now finally, there was this argument that the\n            defendant got nothing out of this. I suggest\n            to you, just use your common sense.     You've\n            got a building that's useless. You've got a\n            building that people are chasing you after.\n            You've   got  a   building   where  your   tax\n            liabilities for the property are ballooning as\n            time goes on. And you owe the bank a lot of\n            money. . . .\n\n\n                                -24-\n\f            This defendant had every incentive to want\n            that building gone, to be rid of that\n            building. And by getting [Scottsdale] to get\n            him off the hook and basically pay the entire\n            mortgage, everything that was due and owing to\n            the bank on that, as well as everything he had\n            to pay to Kevin Mahoney and Randy Adamson to\n            take the building down, you can't say that the\n            defendant got nothing.     He got the entire\n            benefit of that. He got completely free and\n            clear of that horrible investment that he made\n            for whatever reason back in 1989.\n\nTrial Tr. 5-93-94 (emphasis added).            This argument, the appellant\n\nargues,   was    highly   prejudicial      and    warrants     reversal   of   his\n\nconviction.\n\n            On this issue, the appropriate standard of review is\n\nclear.    Because DeCicco did not object to the government's closing\n\narguments, we review for plain error.             See Olano, 507 U.S. at 732.\n\n            After reviewing the record, we do not believe that the\n\ngovernment violated the district court's order when it stated that\n\nthe appellant \"had every incentive to want that building gone, to\n\nbe rid of that building.\"         For several reasons, we think that in\n\nmaking    such   a   statement,    the    government    was     addressing     the\n\nappellant's desire to have the building gone in an economic sense\n\n(as in \"gone from his portfolio\").               We also think this is how a\n\njury would have understood such a statement.\n\n            First, and most importantly, we look at the context in\n\nwhich these words were uttered.            At the time the government made\n\nthe statement at issue here, it was discussing the nature of\n\nappellant's      investments,     tax   liabilities,     and    mortgages.     The\n\n                                        -25-\n\fgovernment was not discussing any allegations that the appellant\n\nwas responsible for the fires.          The context of the government's\n\nstatement leads us to believe that the government desired only to\n\ndiscuss how the appellant sought to maximize his recovery from\n\nScottsdale and rid himself entirely of a horrible investment\n\nthrough the submission of false claims.                 See Whitman v. Am.\n\nTrucking Ass'ns, 531 U.S. 457, 466 (2001) (\"Words that can have\n\nmore   than    one   meaning   are   given   content,    however,   by   their\n\nsurroundings.\"); California v. Brown, 479 U.S. 538, 543 (1987)\n\n(discussing the relevance of the noscitur a sociis canon -- which\n\nliterally means \"it is known from its associates\" and instructs\n\nthat \"the meaning of an unclear word or phrase should be determined\n\nby the words immediately surrounding it\" -- in assessing the\n\nvalidity of a jury instruction); Neal v. Clark, 95 U.S. 704, 708-09\n\n(1878) (\"copulatio verborum indicat acceptationem in eodem sensu --\n\nthe coupling of words together shows that they are to be understood\n\nin the same sense.      And where the meaning of any particular word is\n\ndoubtful or obscure, . . . the intention of the party who has made\n\nuse of it may frequently be ascertained and carried unto effect by\n\nlooking at the adjoining words.\" (citing Broom's Legal Maxims, p.\n\n450)).\n\n              We also read the government's statement as a response to\n\nthe appellant's earlier comment that he had gained nothing from the\n\nalleged fraud.       Appellant's counsel had stated:\n\n\n                                     -26-\n\f          I just want to point out to you again what\n          I've said all along.    When you're out there\n          deliberating, remember, Gary got nothing out\n          of this.    It cost Gary money out of his\n          pocket. Gary lost an asset, a building, that\n          although it was tough to get to, was described\n          as the triple-thick walls, huge beams, a good,\n          solid building he had and he lost. Gary had\n          no reason -- there was no rhyme, no reason for\n          Gary to do anything.\n\nTrial Tr. 5-89.    The government's statement was an attempt to\n\naddress this argument.    In stating that the appellant \"had every\n\nincentive to want that building gone, to be rid of that building,\"\n\nthe government was attempting to counter the appellant's argument\n\nand show that the appellant did indeed reap a benefit from the\n\nalleged mail fraud.      The complained-of statement addressed the\n\nappellant's motive in committing the fraud -- namely his desire to\n\nhave a troublesome financial investment removed from his portfolio\n\nby having Scottsdale pay off his mortgage and the entire cost of\n\ndemolition.\n\n          We therefore find that the government did not violate the\n\ndistrict court's order to refrain from discussing the appellant's\n\nresponsibility for the fires.    Once again, the appellant fails to\n\nshow the error required under the \"plain error\" test.\n\n                  IV.   The accountant's testimony\n\n          DeCicco's final argument is that the district court erred\n\nin admitting the testimony of his accountant Stewart regarding his\n\n(DeCicco's) missing expense documentation. We review the admission\n\nof evidence under Fed. R. Evid. 404(b) for abuse of discretion.\n\n                                -27-\n\fUnited States v. Smith, 292 F.3d 90, 98 (1st Cir. 2002).                      \"[A]n\n\nabuse   of    discretion      occurs    when   a    relevant     factor    deserving\n\nsignificant weight is overlooked, or when an improper factor is\n\naccorded significant weight, or when the court considers the\n\nappropriate     mix     of   factors,   but    commits      a   palpable   error    of\n\njudgment in calibrating the decisional scales.\"                    United States v.\n\nGilbert, 229 F.3d 15, 21 (1st Cir. 2000) (citing United States v.\n\nRoberts, 978 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir. 1992) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted)).\n\n              In DeCicco I, we held that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion in excluding the testimony of DeCicco's accountant,\n\nRichard      Stewart,    regarding      DeCicco's        outstanding     income    tax\n\nliabilities, concluding that it was relevant to DeCicco's motive to\n\ncommit arson and mail fraud and, hence, admissible under Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 404(b).        We also found that the evidence was not excludable\n\nunder Fed. R. Evid. 403, because \"when offered for the limited\n\npurpose of showing motive, and viewed in the context of the\n\ngovernment's charges, any danger of unfair prejudice in this case\n\nis minimal.\"      DeCicco, 370 F.3d at 214.\n\n              When    Stewart's   testimony        was   offered    at   trial,    the\n\ngovernment informed the district court that it intended to elicit\n\nfrom Stewart not just the amount of tax liability which he had\n\ncalculated -- the issue before this Court in DeCicco I -- but also\n\nthat Stewart had sought additional documentation from DeCicco to\n\n\n                                        -28-\n\fsupport claimed deductions which would have reduced DeCicco's tax\n\nliability to about ten percent of what Stewart had calculated. The\n\nappellant objected to this additional testimony by Stewart.    The\n\ndistrict court, however, ruled that the testimony was admissible\n\nbecause this Court said that it was.\n\n          Appellant contests this ruling, noting that although this\n\nCourt has ruled that Stewart's testimony regarding DeCicco's tax\n\nliabilities was admissible under Fed. R. Evid. 404(b), the question\n\nof Stewart's testimony regarding DeCicco's failure to provide him\n\nwith documentation supporting expenses he claimed as deductions was\n\nnot before the Court.   Contrary to the district court's position,\n\nappellant argues that this Court's decision in DeCicco I did not\n\nrequire it to admit this portion of Stewart's testimony.\n\n          We believe that the district court made the correct\n\ndecision in admitting the evidence.     Federal Rule of Evidence\n\n404(b) provides that:\n\n          Evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts is\n          not admissible to prove the character of a\n          person in order to show action in conformity\n          therewith. It may, however, be admissible for\n          other purposes, such as proof of motive,\n          opportunity,   intent,   preparation,   plan,\n          knowledge, identity or absence of mistake\n          . . . .\n\nFed. R. Evid. 404(b).   Therefore, as we noted in DeCicco I, \"mere\n\npropensity evidence is never admissible solely to show a character\n\ninclined towards unlawful behavior.     The same evidence may be\n\nadmissible, however, even if it may be construed as propensity\n\n                               -29-\n\fevidence, if it is used to show any of the other elements set out\n\nin the rule.\"   DeCicco, 370 F.3d at 210-11 (citations omitted).\n\n          We use a two-part test to evaluate the admissibility of\n\nevidence under Rule 404(b).      First, we must determine whether the\n\nevidence in question has any \"special relevance\" exclusive of\n\ndefendant's   character    or   propensity.   See   United   States   v.\n\nSebaggala, 256 F.3d 59, 67 (1st Cir. 2001) (the proffered evidence\n\n\"must not merely show a defendant's reprehensible character or\n\npredisposition toward knavery . . . .\").       Second, even if some\n\n\"special relevance\" is found, the evidence must nonetheless be\n\nexcluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the\n\ndanger of unfair prejudice. \"Rule 404(b) incorporates sub silentio\n\nthe prophylaxis of Federal Rule of Evidence 403.\"      Id.\n\n          Regarding the first prong of the test, the appellant\n\nargues that \"Stewart's testimony regarding DeCicco's failure to\n\nprovide him with the documentation necessary to reduce his tax\n\nliability by 90% was not relevant to the question of DeCicco's\n\nmotive to commit arson or mail fraud, nor did the government ever\n\narticulate a basis for its admissibility under Rule 404(b).\"          He\n\nstates that this was evidence which the jury would have used purely\n\nfor propensity purposes.    In his eyes, the jury would draw only two\n\nconclusions from this evidence: (1) that DeCicco had misrepresented\n\nhis business expenses to Stewart in hopes of limiting his tax\n\nliability, and (2) that his businesses must have been conducted\n\n\n                                  -30-\n\fdishonestly if he could not produce even something so routine as\n\npayroll records.   Thus, the jury would have reasoned that because\n\nDeCicco had attempted to defraud the federal and state taxing\n\nauthorities and because he must have been conducting his businesses\n\nin a dishonest manner, as evidenced by the lack of even the most\n\nroutine recordkeeping, he was more likely to have perpetrated a\n\nfraud on Scottsdale.     As such, he argues, this evidence was pure\n\npropensity evidence and should not have been admitted under the\n\nfirst prong of Rule 404(b).\n\n          We, however, believe that Stewart's testimony relating to\n\nthe missing expense documentation contained a \"special relevance\"\n\nexclusive of DeCicco's character and propensity.         In particular,\n\nsuch testimony was relevant to DeCicco's motive for committing the\n\ncharged mail fraud offenses.\n\n          In DeCicco I, we came to a similar conclusion when we\n\nstated   that   Stewart's   testimony    relating   to   DeCicco's   tax\n\nliabilities could be used \"in order to show for what purpose the\n\nfraudulently obtained insurance proceeds were intended\" -- i.e., to\n\nshow that the money obtained from Scottsdale would be used to\n\ndefray DeCicco's tax liabilities.       DeCicco, 370 F.3d at 214.    In\n\nthis appeal, we find that Stewart's testimony relating to the\n\nmissing expense documentation also related to DeCicco's motive, but\n\nin a different way.    In his opening, DeCicco had argued that he had\n\nto have been making a lot of money to generate such large tax\n\n\n                                 -31-\n\fliabilities and therefore had no motive to commit the charged\n\nfraud.        Stewart's   testimony   relating   to    the   missing   expense\n\ndocumentation helped provide a response to this contention. It was\n\nused     to   show   that   the   appellant's    net    income   was   likely\n\nsignificantly less than the available documentation suggested and\n\nthat the appellant likely did not have money on hand to pay what he\n\nowed.    Thus, Stewart's testimony helped the government demonstrate\n\nthat DeCicco did indeed have a motive to fraudulently obtain\n\ninsurance proceeds from Scottsdale -- i.e., the alleged mail fraud\n\nprovided him with the funds he needed to pay his debts.5\n\n              The appellant also argues that Stewart's testimony should\n\nbe excluded under Fed. R. Evid. 403, which is incorporated into the\n\nsecond prong of the Rule 404(b) test, because any probative value\n\nwhich Stewart's testimony had was substantially outweighed by the\n\neffect of unfair prejudice.       However, this argument fails as well,\n\nbecause, as we stated in DeCicco I, \"we are of the view that, when\n\n\n5\n   In other words, Stewart's testimony about DeCicco's missing\nexpense documentation was used to show that DeCicco was not as\nwealthy as he claimed. The fact that DeCicco could not produce\ndocumentation to support some of his claimed expenses could lead\none to believe that perhaps DeCicco had expenses that were \"off the\nbooks.\" For example, perhaps he paid certain employees with cash\nin order to avoid payroll taxes. If this was the case and DeCicco\ndid in fact have a number of additional expenses beyond those that\nwere covered in his documentation, his net income would have been\nless than he had claimed it was. And if his net income was less\nthan he claimed it was, he would have had difficulty paying off his\ndebts.   Thus, DeCicco did indeed have a motive to commit mail\nfraud. Such a fraud would have provided him with extra funds to\npay off his income taxes, his property taxes, and his mortgages and\ncommercial loans.\n\n                                      -32-\n\foffered for the limited purpose of showing motive, and viewed in\n\nthe context of the government's charges, any danger of unfair\n\nprejudice in this case is minimal.\"     DeCicco, 370 F.3d at 214.   We\n\ncontinue to hold this belief, and it is fatal to DeCicco's claim\n\nhere.   Accordingly, we find that the district court did not abuse\n\nits discretion in admitting Stewart's testimony about DeCicco's\n\nmissing expense documentation.\n\n                          V.   Conclusion\n\n           For the reasons stated above, we affirm the judgment of\n\nthe district court.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -33-\n\f",

DeCicco (\"appellant\") with four counts of mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341, in connection with claims for insurance proceeds submitted in the wake of two 1995 fires (Counts 1-4), and two counts of use of fire to commit a felony, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 844(h)(1) &amp; (2) (Counts 5-6). Although DeCicco was eventually acquitted on the use-of-fire counts, he was convicted on the four mail fraud counts. He now appeals this conviction. After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1989, DeCicco bought a building located at 17 Rear Heard Street in Chelsea, Massachusetts for $60,000. Earlier that year, before buying the building, he had applied to the City of Chelsea (\"Chelsea\") for a permit to use the building as a warehouse for two moving companies that he owned. The building, however, was surrounded by residential buildings and had only a narrow driveway providing access. Chelsea therefore denied the appellant's application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DeCicco nonetheless went ahead with the purchase. Although the building price was only $60,000, he obtained a loan of $104,000 from Somerset Bank, secured by a mortgage on the property. Notwithstanding the denial of the occupancy permit, DeCicco initially tried to use the building as a warehouse. He was, however, prevented from doing so by Chelsea. As a result, he ended up with a significant mortgage on a building he could not use for the purpose he desired. By August 1991, he was in arrears on the mortgage, and Somerset Bank informed him that it was intending to initiate foreclosure proceedings. Moreover, the appellant had two other obligations to Somerset Bank by this time: a $400,000 loan used to build a new warehouse in Revere, Massachusetts (\"Revere\"), and a short-term, $80,000 commercial loan. The appellant was falling behind on the Revere loan as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1991, DeCicco obtained insurance on the Rear Heard Street building from the Lincoln Insurance Company (\"Lincoln\"). However, he misrepresented that the premises were occupied, and after this fact was discovered upon inspection, Lincoln, on March 3, 1992, sent a cancellation notice by certified mail to the appellant. The notice advised the appellant that his insurance policy would be cancelled effective March 13, 1992 at 12:01 a.m.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Just twenty-nine hours before the insurance was to lapse, a fire occurred at the Rear Heard Street building. Investigators determined that the fire was intentionally set using a liquid accelerant at the base of the support pillars in a manner designed to bring the building down. The Fire Department responded quickly, however, and such little damage occurred that the appellant did not file a claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the cancellation of the Lincoln policy, the Rear Heard Street building went for three years without insurance. At some point during this period, the appellant retained Richard Stewart (\"Stewart\"), an accountant, to help him prepare income tax returns for the years 1992, 1993, and 1994. In December 1994, Stewart informed the appellant that, based on the information available to him and the draft returns he had prepared, the appellant owed $1,246,298 in federal and state taxes and penalties for 1992, 1993, and 1994. The draft returns reflected some deductions for expenses, but they did not reflect deductions for such business expenses as payroll. Based on Stewart's training and experience, he estimated that the appellant's tax liability might have been reduced by as much as ninety percent if the appellant had documentation for these expenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aside from his significant personal income tax liability, DeCicco also continued to have other financial issues during this period. He owed a total of $65,673.56 to Revere in property taxes. He was also in significant arrears on property taxes for the Rear Heard Street building in Chelsea. By July 1995, the amount he owed to Chelsea had ballooned to approximately $12,000. Finally, he still owed almost $95,000 to Somerset Bank in connection with the loan used to purchase the Rear Heard Street building, which was essentially vacant, and which he was expressly forbidden to use in connection with his moving companies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 1995, facing all of these financial pressures, DeCicco once again attempted to obtain insurance on the Rear Heard Street building. On May 17, 1995, the Scottsdale Insurance Company (\"Scottsdale\") issued the appellant an insurance policy providing coverage of up to $125,000 for the building.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Less than two months later, on July 9, 1995, the building was intentionally set on fire for a second time, with at least four separate fires started on the second floor of the warehouse. The Fire Department again responded quickly, and the fires were extinguished. However, twelve days later, on July 21, 1995, a third fire was intentionally set in the building in the early morning hours. This was a multiple-alarm fire, requiring Chelsea to call for aid from Revere, Everett, and Boston to fight the fire. It took approximately four hours to extinguish the blaze. In the end, the building was completely destroyed. The fire also damaged a neighboring garage; melted the siding on a nearby building; and destroyed the kitchen, bathroom, and pantry on the third floor of another building.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the extensive damage, Chelsea ordered the appellant to demolish what was left of the building. The appellant asked Kevin Mahoney (\"Mahoney\") to perform the work. Mahoney discussed the matter with his cousin, Randy Adamson, and then agreed to demolish the building for $13,800, a price that the appellant accepted. Mahoney and Adamson, using helpers and equipment, demolished the building and removed the rubble in approximately six days. The appellant paid Mahoney with an initial check of $4,000 and then later paid the remaining $9,800.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DeCicco then sought the assistance of a public claims adjustor, Terence Lynn (\"Lynn\"), to assist in filing his claim with Scottsdale, to recover pursuant to the insurance policy for the destruction of the building. However, almost immediately a number of points of contention arose between the appellant and Scottsdale. In early September 1995, in a communication between Lynn and Scottsdale regarding the appellant's claim, an issue arose regarding whether the building was vacant at the time of the fire. This was important, because according to the terms of the Scottsdale policy, recovery for a fire loss could be reduced by fifteen percent if the building was vacant when the fire occurred. On September 19, 1995, as this issue regarding vacancy was pending, the appellant's insurance broker, Justin Kaan, faxed to Lynn a document signed by the appellant and purporting to set forth certain items that were in the warehouse at the time of the fire, including dollies, a piano, a desk, chairs, and a couch. Scottsdale's fire investigator, however, saw no evidence of dollies or a piano when he examined the remains of the building after the fire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There were other controversies as well. On September 20, 1995, Lynn sent a letter to Scottsdale's representative, John Bottini (\"Bottini\"). Lynn wrote that \"I have enclosed a copy of the wrecking bill in the amount of $23,681, which was performed as a result of an emergency raze or repair order issued by the municipality shortly after the occurrence of the loss.\" The enclosed demolition bill purported to bear the signature of Arthur Adamson. However, according to Mahoney, who actually did the demolition work with Randy Adamson, DeCicco only paid $13,800, the agreed-upon price for the work. Furthermore, both Randy Adamson and his mother stated that the signature on the demolition bill submitted to Bottini was not that of Arthur Adamson (who died in 1997), nor was the bill on his letterhead.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 17, 1995, Lynn mailed to Bottini another letter in which he again mentioned the $23,681 demolition bill. Included with this letter was the partial sworn statement in proof of loss referenced in Count 1 of the indictment and a request for an advance payment of $25,000. In an attempt to get Scottsdale to issue this advance payment, Lynn's letter stated, among other things: \"We both know that Massachusetts is a so-called broad evidence rule state. The disagreements as to value and loss are still subject to indemnification of the insured whose indebtedness to the mortgagee as of this date of loss was $97,016.29 and who has incurred a wrecking bill of $23,681.\" Scottsdale thereafter forwarded Lynn a $25,000 check &#8212; the Count 2 mailing &#8212; which Lynn sent to Somerset Bank, which was named as a loss payee because of its mortgage on the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 2, 1996, Lynn sent a letter to Bottini enclosing a proposed sworn statement in proof of loss seeking to achieve a final settlement of the losses and again noting, among other things, that \"the incurred cost of wrecking the structure was $23,681. . . .\" Lynn also claimed in this letter that the appellant had made extensive renovations to the building, including installation of a hot air heating system, an electrical system, a two-piece bath, a new roof, skylights, and a $10,000 power lift. However, the appellant had told Bottini shortly after the fire that the warehouse had had neither heat nor electricity. Furthermore, Scottsdale's fire investigator saw no evidence of a power lift and noted that neither the heating system nor the electrical system had been operational at the time of the fire. Bottini was never provided with any documentation to support DeCicco's claimed improvements. He rejected the proposed proof of loss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bottini and Lynn eventually negotiated a settlement, and on February 7, 1996, Lynn sent Bottini a letter &#8212; the Count 3 mailing &#8212; containing a sworn proof of loss reflecting the settlement figures of $95,283 for the building and $23,681 for the demolition, for a total of $118,964. Bottini states that had he known that the actual cost of the demolition was less than $23,681, he would not have agreed to the final settlement amount, and had Scottsdale been aware that the actual amount incurred was less, it would not have paid that amount. Bottini, however, acknowledged that $23,681 was a fair figure for the demolition, given the building's size.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 27, 1996, Scottsdale sent a check to Lynn in the amount of $91,964 &#8212; the Count 4 mailing &#8212; the settlement amount minus two $1,000 deductibles and the $25,000 advance payment. That check listed as payees DeCicco, Lynn, Somerset Bank, and Chelsea.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> DeCicco took the check to a bank and deposited it. Although it appeared that the check had been endorsed by each of the payees, the endorsements of both Joseph Bianco on behalf of Somerset Bank and Alicia Silverberg on behalf of Chelsea were forged; indeed, no one named Alicia Silverberg had ever worked for the Chelsea City Treasurer's Office. Somerset Bank did ultimately receive insurance proceeds in the form of a Bank of Boston check from the appellant in the amount of $92,500, which satisfied the mortgage on the Rear Heard Street building in full. Bianco understood that this payment represented the Scottsdale insurance proceeds. Chelsea, however, never received payment for the real estate taxes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 27, 2000, the grand jury sitting in Boston returned its indictment, charging the appellant with four counts of mail fraud, and two counts of use of fire to commit a felony. With respect to the four mail fraud counts, the indictment alleged in one paragraph (paragraph 5) that DeCicco caused the destruction of the warehouse by fire. It alleged in a separate paragraph (paragraph 4) that \"following the damage by fire . . . [DeCicco] would and did cause the submission . . . of false and fraudulent claims for building loss insurance proceeds.\" The language of paragraph 4 does not make the alleged falsity of DeCicco's claims conditional upon any other acts on his part, nor does it specify that the claims were false for a certain reason. Paragraph 4 is therefore broad enough to support not just the theory that DeCicco's claims were fraudulent because he caused the fire, but also the theory that his claims were fraudulent for independent reasons, regardless of how the fire may have started. The other two counts, regarding use of fire to commit a felony, charged the appellant with violations of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 844(h)(1) &amp; (2) based on the fires that occurred at the Rear Heard Street building on July 9, 1995 and July 21, 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 14, 2003, prior to trial, the district court granted the appellant's motion to exclude evidence, pursuant to Fed. R.Evid. 403 and 404(b), regarding (1) the March 1992 fire that occurred at the same property involved in the indicted counts, and (2) testimony of Stewart, DeCicco's accountant, regarding DeCicco's income tax liabilities. The government appealed from this ruling, and this Court reversed the district court's exclusion of the evidence. <i>See United States v. DeCicco,</i> 370 F.3d 206 (1st Cir.2004) (\"<i>DeCicco I</i>\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case proceeded to trial on November 8, 2004. One of the government's key witnesses was the accountant Stewart, who testified not only about the amount of DeCicco's tax liability &#8212; the issue before this Court on the prior appeal &#8212; but also about the fact that Stewart had sought additional documentation from DeCicco to support claimed deductions which would have reduced DeCicco's tax liability. DeCicco objected to this additional testimony by Stewart. The district court, however, ruled that the testimony was admissible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the conclusion of the government's evidence, DeCicco made a motion, pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 29, that there was insufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, particularly as to the use-of-fire counts. The district court granted the appellant's motion for a required finding of not guilty as to one of the counts charging the appellant with use of fire to commit a felony but denied the motion as to the mail fraud counts and the other count charging use of fire to commit a felony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the appellant put on his case, he called several witnesses, including Terence Lynn, the public claims adjustor, and Lawrence Maddeford, who lived next to the Rear Heard Street building. Maddeford observed that kids would hang out at the building all the time, breaking through the boarded-up windows to gain access. Despite Maddeford registering numerous complaints with the police, the building essentially became a clubhouse for the kids for several years. After the fire destroyed the building, that was the end of the clubhouse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the conclusion of DeCicco's case, he renewed his Rule 29 motion. The district court entertained argument on the issue again, noting that although it had denied the motion with respect to Count Six (the remaining use-of-fire count), it would \"like the government's argument, in view of the fact there appears to be a witness [Maddeford] &#8212; seems to me a very credible witness &#8212; who raised a great doubt as to whether or not these what you call vagrants or kids constituted a nuisance did, in fact, cause the fire.\" After argument, the district court granted the appellant's motion for a required finding of not guilty as to the other count charging use of fire to commit a felony. The court also issued an order to the parties that they were not to argue to the jury during closing arguments that the appellant was, or was not, responsible for the fires.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 17, 2004, the jury found the appellant guilty on all four remaining mail fraud counts. The district court sentenced DeCicco to two years of probation, a $7,500 fine, and restitution of $9,881. It is this conviction that he appeals here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>II. Constructive amendment and material variance claims</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DeCicco's first claim is that there was a constructive amendment of his indictment, or alternatively, that there was a material variance between the indictment and proof that affected his substantial rights. In <i>United States v. Fisher,</i> 3 F.3d 456 (1st Cir.1993), we described the difference between a \"constructive amendment\" and a \"material variance\":</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A constructive amendment occurs when the charging terms of the indictment are altered, either literally or in effect, by prosecution or court after the grand jury has last passed upon them. A variance occurs when the charging terms remain unchanged but when the facts proved at trial are different from those alleged in the indictment. A constructive amendment is considered prejudicial per se and grounds for reversal of a conviction. Variance is grounds for reversal only if it affected the defendant's \"substantial rights\" &#8212; i.e., the rights to have sufficient knowledge of the charge against him in order to prepare an effective defense and avoid surprise at trial, and to prevent a second prosecution for the same offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 462-63 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); <i>see also United States v. Arcadipane,</i> 41 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.1994) (variance requires reversal of a conviction \"if it is both material and prejudicial\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Standard of review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In assessing DeCicco's \"constructive amendment\" and \"material variance\" claims, we must first determine the appropriate standard of review. The appellant claims that because these issues were preserved through his objections at trial, <i>de novo</i> review is appropriate. The government argues in opposition that the appellant made no such objections; as a result, we should review for \"plain error.\" <i>See United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 731, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the district court, DeCicco twice moved for judgments of acquittal, arguing that there was insufficient evidence that he was responsible for the fires to permit the use-of-fire counts to go to the jury and that \"the other counts are conditioned upon a finding of guilt on Counts 5 and 6 [the use-of-fire counts] in terms of using the fire to actually commit the . . . mail fraud counts. . . .\" At two different points &#8212; both after the conclusion of the government's case and after the conclusion of the appellant's case &#8212; the district court made apparent its disagreement with such a proposition, based on its assessment that DeCicco could be guilty of mail fraud, even if he were not responsible for the fires, if he simply took advantage of the fires by submitting an inflated bill for the demolition costs. Nevertheless, DeCicco argues here that these motions sufficed to preserve his objection that the district court would be constructively amending the indictment if it allowed him to be tried for a scheme to defraud other than the one charged in the indictment, namely, a scheme to cause the destruction of the Rear Heard Street building by fire in order to fraudulently claim insurance proceeds for the loss of the building. He also states that these motions were sufficient to preserve his objection that the district court was effecting a material variance between indictment and proof that affected his substantial rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We fail to see, however, how the motions cited by DeCicco can be deemed \"constructive amendment\" or \"material variance\" objections. Despite his attempt to spin them that way, the arguments he made in support of his motions were merely an articulation of his view that no charges would survive if the district court granted the motions, particularly with regard to the use-of-fire counts. Moreover, after the district court clearly stated its belief &#8212; twice &#8212; that the indictment comprehended the theory that the appellant had taken advantage of the fires by submitting false insurance claims, the appellant interposed no objection or argument that this would constitute a \"constructive amendment\" of the indictment or a \"material variance\" between indictment and proof. Under Fed.R.Crim.P. 51(b), a party may preserve a claim of error by informing the court &#8212; when the court ruling or order is made or sought &#8212; of the party's objection to the court's action and the grounds for that objection. Here, however, the appellant took no such action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of these facts, we believe that DeCicco did not preserve his objections and that the \"plain error\" test should apply in this instance. Under this standard, there must have been an error, the error must have been \"plain,\" and the error must have affected the substantial rights of the appellant. <i>See Olano,</i> 507 U.S. at 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770. If all three elements are satisfied, we have the authority to order correction of the error, but we are not required to do so. <i>Id.</i> at 735, 113 S.Ct. 1770. We exercise this discretion only where the plain error \"seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>Id.</i> at 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Constructive amendment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant makes two separate \"constructive amendment\" claims. First, he reads the indictment to include one theory and one theory only: that he had devised a scheme to submit insurance claims to Scottsdale which were false and fraudulent <i>because he caused the fires</i> (i.e., as the one who started the fires, he was not entitled to any recovery). However, he notes that after the district court ruled that the government had presented insufficient evidence that DeCicco was responsible for the fires, the government shifted its theory in its closing arguments to discuss how the appellant had devised a scheme to submit insurance claims to Scottsdale which were false and fraudulent <i>for reasons entirely independent of whether he caused the fires.</i> When the government made this shift, he argues, it impermissibly broadened the possible bases for conviction beyond those set forth in the indictment returned by the grand jury. This shift in theory, from one in which DeCicco's responsibility for the fires was an essential component of the fraudulent scheme to one in which it was unnecessary, constituted a constructive amendment of the indictment in violation of the Fifth Amendment Grand Jury clause. This shift broadened the scheme charged in the indictment because it permitted his conviction to rest on claims for insurance proceeds which were fraudulent for <i>any</i> reason, not just because DeCicco was responsible for the fires.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant, however, misreads the indictment. He is incorrect in maintaining that the indictment did not encompass claims for insurance proceeds that were fraudulent for reasons other than that he had caused the fires. The indictment alleged, in two separate and distinct paragraphs, two separate and distinct ways in which the appellant perpetrated mail fraud: (1) by causing the submission to Scottsdale of false and fraudulent claims for building loss insurance proceeds, and (2) by actually causing the damage to and destruction of the Rear Heard Street building by fire. In other words, the indictment contained two completely separate theories. In the first theory, DeCicco committed mail fraud because he submitted false and fraudulent claims for insurance proceeds after the fire, however it may have started. In the second theory, the appellant committed mail fraud for a different reason. The claims that he submitted were false and fraudulent because <i>he caused the fire</i> (and therefore was not entitled to any recovery).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the mail fraud counts of the indictment were not dependent on the theory that the appellant had caused the fires. Instead, they were so fashioned as to comprehend that one could take advantage of a fire and commit mail fraud even without having caused the fire. In other words, the appellant's misrepresentations &#8212; for example, in the fraudulent demolition bill or in the phony list of property in the warehouse at the time of the fire or in the letter sent by Lynn to Bottini listing improvements made to the property by DeCicco &#8212; could be used to show he committed mail fraud, regardless of whether he started the fires. As such, when the government made the shift complained of by the appellant, the government was not exceeding the scope of the indictment but was merely operating with its confines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both parties point to the Supreme Court's decision in <i>United States v. Miller,</i> 471 U.S. 130, 105 S.Ct. 1811, 85 L.Ed.2d 99 (1985), to support their respective positions. We think <i>Miller</i> clearly shows that there was no \"constructive amendment\" in this case. In <i>Miller,</i> the defendant was convicted of two counts of mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341. The indictment in the case alleged a scheme to defraud with two distinct components; specifically, the indictment alleged <i>both</i> that the defendant had defrauded his insurer by consenting to a burglary in advance <i>and</i> by then lying to the insurer regarding the amount of copper wire which was stolen during that burglary. The trial evidence, however, went only to the allegation that the defendant had lied regarding his copper-wire claim. The government moved to strike the portion of the indictment that alleged the defendant's pre-knowledge of the burglary, but, when the defendant opposed that motion, the entire indictment went to the jury. The defendant was convicted, and on appeal, complained that both prongs of his indictment were not satisfied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court affirmed Miller's conviction, finding that the pre-knowledge of the burglary in Miller's indictment constituted a segregable component of the charged scheme to defraud, and that the evidence presented regarding the inflated copper-wire claim was sufficient to support a conviction. The Court noted that nothing new was added to the grand jury's indictment and that \"Miller was tried on an indictment that clearly set out the offense for which he was ultimately convicted.\" <i>Miller,</i> 471 U.S. at 140, 105 S.Ct. 1811.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the present case, the indictment similarly contains two distinct and segregable components. As we have demonstrated above, and contrary to the appellant's assertion that the indictment in this case \"did not specify any separable, independently fraudulent scheme on which conviction based on a narrower scheme than that charged in the indictment might validly rest,\" the indictment at issue here alleged two separate and distinct ways in which the appellant perpetrated mail fraud, neither of which was dependent on the other. And just as in <i>Miller,</i> where the removal of the allegation of complicity in the burglary resulted in a permissible narrowing of the indictment, leaving intact the theory that the defendant had submitted inflated insurance claims, so too could the deletion of the allegation of complicity in the fires here result in a permissible narrowing of the indictment, leaving intact the separate theory that the appellant had submitted claims that were false and fraudulent for reasons unrelated to whether he had started the fires.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DeCicco's second \"constructive amendment\" claim is as follows: The indictment charged him with submitting false and fraudulent claims for <i>building loss</i> insurance proceeds, but the centerpiece of the government's argument to the jury urging it to convict DeCicco of mail fraud was not a false and fraudulent claim for <i>building loss</i> insurance proceeds at all &#8212; it was a claim for reimbursement for <i>demolition</i> expenses which the government contended was falsely inflated. DeCicco supports his argument by pointing to how the Scottsdale insurance settlement had two independent components: one amount for the loss of the building, and another amount for the demolition costs. The two were completely separate. He similarly notes how the Scottsdale policy expressly differentiates between building loss and debris removal. In his eyes, the government's reliance on the demolition bill created the strong possibility that he was convicted of an offense other than that charged by the grand jury. This, therefore, constituted a constructive amendment of the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We, however, do not find this argument convincing. The indictment is not tied to any particular provision of the settlement agreement or the Scottsdale policy. As a result, we believe that the grand jury, when issuing its indictment, was speaking generically about \"building loss\" and was not using the specific definition of that phrase as provided for in the settlement agreement or the Scottsdale policy. We also think it inconceivable that the grand jury in this instance would issue an indictment limited only to \"building loss\" proceeds, as that term was used in the settlement agreement or the Scottsdale policy, when there was ample evidence that the appellant had also submitted false and fraudulent claims relating to \"demolition\" or \"debris removal\" expenses, as <i>those</i> terms were used in the settlement agreement and the Scottsdale policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find, therefore, that there was no \"constructive amendment\" of the indictment in this instance. Since there was no error, appellant cannot possibly satisfy the \"plain error\" standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Material variance</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if there was no constructive amendment, the appellant argues that there was, at a minimum, a material variance between indictment and proof. In this iteration of his argument, appellant concedes that the charging terms of the indictment are not in dispute. However, he claims that the facts proved at trial were different from those alleged in the indictment. In his view, the indictment alleged facts relating to one theory &#8212; namely, that his insurance claims were false and fraudulent because he had caused the fires to occur. The facts presented at trial, however, related to another theory &#8212; that his insurance claims were false and fraudulent because he had submitted false documentation in support of his claims. This was a variance, and it was one that affected his \"substantial rights\" in two ways: 1) he had insufficient notice to be able to prepare an effective defense to the new theory which the government argued to the jury; and 2) he was prejudiced by the continuing use of evidence which had been admitted solely because it was relevant to the use-of-fire counts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This claim, however, fails at its foundation. Once again, the appellant misconstrues the indictment. As we related above, the indictment clearly comprehended the theory that DeCicco's insurance claims were false and fraudulent for reasons unrelated to whether he had caused the fires. In particular, they were false and fraudulent because he had submitted false documentation in support of his claims. The sworn statements in proof of loss and the insurance settlement checks discussed in the indictment clearly related to this theory. Moreover, the facts that were presented at trial related to this theory. For example, facts were presented that he had provided a false demolition bill, that he had provided a phony list of property in the warehouse at the time of the fire, and that he had falsely listed improvements made to the property in the letter sent to Bottini. These falsities all led to the fraudulent sworn statements in proof of loss referenced in the indictment and were what prompted the insurance settlement checks sent by Scottsdale that were also referenced in the indictment. Thus, the facts proved at trial were not different from those alleged in the indictment, and there was no variance. Since there was no variance, we do not reach the question of whether such an alleged variance was material or whether the appellant's substantial rights were affected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p>III. Potential violation of the district court's order</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant next argues that the government committed reversible misconduct in its closing arguments to the jury. Before the closing arguments commenced, the district court instructed the parties that they were not to argue to the jury that DeCicco was, or was not, responsible for the fires. The appellant here argues that the government violated this order when it explicitly argued to the jury that DeCicco had a motive to want the building <i>gone.</i> Such an argument, contends the appellant, the jury could only have interpreted as suggesting DeCicco's responsibility for the fires. Appellant, in particular, points to the following statements by the government during closing arguments:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now finally, there was this argument that the defendant got nothing out of this. I suggest to you, just use your common sense. You've got a building that's useless. You've got a building that people are chasing you after. You've got a building where your tax liabilities for the property are ballooning as time goes on. And you owe the bank a lot of money. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>This defendant had every incentive to want that building gone, to be rid of that building.</i> And by getting [Scottsdale] to get him off the hook and basically pay the entire mortgage, everything that was due and owing to the bank on that, as well as everything he had to pay to Kevin Mahoney and Randy Adamson to take the building down, you can't say that the defendant got nothing. He got the entire benefit of that. He got completely free and clear of that horrible investment that he made for whatever reason back in 1989.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial Tr. 5-93-94 (emphasis added). This argument, the appellant argues, was highly prejudicial and warrants reversal of his conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this issue, the appropriate standard of review is clear. Because DeCicco did not object to the government's closing arguments, we review for plain error. <i>See Olano,</i> 507 U.S. at 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reviewing the record, we do not believe that the government violated the district court's order when it stated that the appellant \"had every incentive to want that building gone, to be rid of that building.\" For several reasons, we think that in making such a statement, the government was addressing the appellant's desire to have the building gone in an economic sense (as in \"gone from his portfolio\"). We also think this is how a jury would have understood such a statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, and most importantly, we look at the context in which these words were uttered. At the time the government made the statement at issue here, it was discussing the nature of appellant's investments, tax liabilities, and mortgages. The government was not discussing any allegations that the appellant was responsible for the fires. The context of the government's statement leads us to believe that the government desired only to discuss how the appellant sought to maximize his recovery from Scottsdale and rid himself entirely of a horrible investment through the submission of false claims. <i>See Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass'ns,</i> 531 U.S. 457, 466, 121 S.Ct. 903, 149 L.Ed.2d 1 (2001) (\"Words that can have more than one meaning are given content, however, by their surroundings.\"); <i>California v. Brown,</i> 479 U.S. 538, 543, 107 S.Ct. 837, 93 L.Ed.2d 934 (1987) (discussing the relevance of the <i>noscitur a sociis</i> canon &#8212; which literally means \"it is known from its associates\" and instructs that \"the meaning of an unclear word or phrase should be determined by the words immediately surrounding it\" &#8212; in assessing the validity of a jury instruction); <i>Neal v. Clark,</i> 95 U.S. 704, 708-09, 24 L.Ed. 586 (1878) (\"<i>copulatio verborum indicat acceptationem in eodem sensu</i>&#8212; the coupling of words together shows that they are to be understood in the same sense. And where the meaning of any particular word is doubtful or obscure, . . . the intention of the party who has made use of it may frequently be ascertained and carried unto effect by looking at the adjoining words.\" (citing Broom's Legal Maxims, p. 450)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also read the government's statement as a response to the appellant's earlier comment that he had gained nothing from the alleged fraud. Appellant's counsel had stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I just want to point out to you again what I've said all along.

Gary lost an asset, a building, that although it was tough to get to, was described as the triple-thick walls, huge beams, a good, solid building he had and he lost.

The government's statement was an attempt to address this argument. In stating that the appellant \"had every incentive to want that building gone, to be rid of that building,\" the government was attempting to counter the appellant's argument and show that the appellant did indeed reap a benefit from the alleged mail fraud. The complained-of statement addressed the appellant's motive in committing the fraud &#8212; namely his desire to have a troublesome financial investment removed from his portfolio by having Scottsdale pay off his mortgage and the entire cost of demolition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore find that the government did not violate the district court's order to refrain from discussing the appellant's responsibility for the fires. Once again, the appellant fails to show the error required under the \"plain error\" test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. The accountant's testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DeCicco's final argument is that the district court erred in admitting the testimony of his accountant Stewart regarding his (DeCicco's) missing expense documentation. We review the admission of evidence under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b) for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Smith,</i> 292 F.3d 90, 98 (1st Cir.2002). \"[A]n abuse of discretion occurs when a relevant factor deserving significant weight is overlooked, or when an improper factor is accorded significant weight, or when the court considers the appropriate mix of factors, but commits a palpable error of judgment in calibrating the decisional scales.\" <i>United States v. Gilbert,</i> 229 F.3d 15, 21 (1st Cir. 2000) (citing <i>United States v. Roberts,</i> 978 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir.1992) (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>DeCicco I,</i> we held that the district court abused its discretion in excluding the testimony of DeCicco's accountant, Richard Stewart, regarding DeCicco's outstanding income tax liabilities, concluding that it was relevant to DeCicco's motive to commit arson and mail fraud and, hence, admissible under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). We also found that the evidence was not excludable under Fed.R.Evid. 403, because \"when offered for the limited purpose of showing motive, and viewed in the context of the government's charges, any danger of unfair prejudice in this case is minimal.\" <i>DeCicco,</i> 370 F.3d at 214.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Stewart's testimony was offered at trial, the government informed the district court that it intended to elicit from Stewart not just the amount of tax liability which he had calculated &#8212; the issue before this Court in <i>DeCicco I</i>&#8212; but also that Stewart had sought additional documentation from DeCicco to support claimed deductions which would have reduced DeCicco's tax liability to about ten percent of what Stewart had calculated. The appellant objected to this additional testimony by Stewart. The district court, however, ruled that the testimony was admissible because this Court said that it was.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant contests this ruling, noting that although this Court has ruled that Stewart's testimony regarding DeCicco's tax liabilities was admissible under Fed. R.Evid. 404(b), the question of Stewart's testimony regarding DeCicco's failure to provide him with documentation supporting expenses he claimed as deductions was not before the Court. Contrary to the district court's position, appellant argues that this Court's decision in <i>DeCicco I</i> did not require it to admit this portion of Stewart's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe that the district court made the correct decision in admitting the evidence. Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) provides that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity or absence of mistake. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). Therefore, as we noted in <i>DeCicco I,</i> \"mere propensity evidence is never admissible solely to show a character inclined towards unlawful behavior. The same evidence may be admissible, however, even if it may be construed as propensity evidence, if it is used to show any of the other elements set out in the rule.\" <i>DeCicco,</i> 370 F.3d at 210-11 (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We use a two-part test to evaluate the admissibility of evidence under Rule 404(b). First, we must determine whether the evidence in question has any \"special relevance\" exclusive of defendant's character or propensity. <i>See United States v. Sebaggala,</i> 256 F.3d 59, 67 (1st Cir.2001) (the proffered evidence \"must not merely show a defendant's reprehensible character or predisposition toward knavery. . . .\"). Second, even if some \"special relevance\" is found, the evidence must nonetheless be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. \"Rule 404(b) incorporates <i>sub silentio</i> the prophylaxis of Federal Rule of Evidence 403.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regarding the first prong of the test, the appellant argues that \"Stewart's testimony regarding DeCicco's failure to provide him with the documentation necessary to reduce his tax liability by 90% was not relevant to the question of DeCicco's motive to commit arson or mail fraud, nor did the government ever articulate a basis for its admissibility under Rule 404(b).\" He states that this was evidence which the jury would have used purely for propensity purposes. In his eyes, the jury would draw only two conclusions from this evidence: (1) that DeCicco had misrepresented his business expenses to Stewart in hopes of limiting his tax liability, and (2) that his businesses must have been conducted dishonestly if he could not produce even something so routine as payroll records. Thus, the jury would have reasoned that because DeCicco had attempted to defraud the federal and state taxing authorities and because he must have been conducting his businesses in a dishonest manner, as evidenced by the lack of even the most routine recordkeeping, he was more likely to have perpetrated a fraud on Scottsdale. As such, he argues, this evidence was pure propensity evidence and should not have been admitted under the first prong of Rule 404(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We, however, believe that Stewart's testimony relating to the missing expense documentation contained a \"special relevance\" exclusive of DeCicco's character and propensity. In particular, such testimony was relevant to DeCicco's motive for committing the charged mail fraud offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>DeCicco I,</i> we came to a similar conclusion when we stated that Stewart's testimony relating to DeCicco's tax liabilities could be used \"in order to show for what purpose the fraudulently obtained insurance proceeds were intended\" &#8212; i.e., to show that the money obtained from Scottsdale would be used to defray DeCicco's tax liabilities. <i>DeCicco,</i> 370 F.3d at 214. In this appeal, we find that Stewart's testimony relating to the missing expense documentation also related to DeCicco's motive, but in a different way. In his opening, DeCicco had argued that he had to have been making a lot of money to generate such large tax liabilities and therefore had no motive to commit the charged fraud. Stewart's testimony relating to the missing expense documentation helped provide a response to this contention. It was used to show that the appellant's net income was likely significantly less than the available documentation suggested and that the appellant likely did not have money on hand to pay what he owed. Thus, Stewart's testimony helped the government demonstrate that DeCicco did indeed have a motive to fraudulently obtain insurance proceeds from Scottsdale &#8212; i.e., the alleged mail fraud provided him with the funds he needed to pay his debts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant also argues that Stewart's testimony should be excluded under Fed.R.Evid. 403, which is incorporated into the second prong of the Rule 404(b) test, because any probative value which Stewart's testimony had was substantially outweighed by the effect of unfair prejudice. However, this argument fails as well, because, as we stated in <i>DeCicco I,</i> \"we are of the view that, when offered for the limited purpose of showing motive, and viewed in the context of the government's charges, any danger of unfair prejudice in this case is minimal.\" <i>DeCicco,</i> 370 F.3d at 214. We continue to hold this belief, and it is fatal to DeCicco's claim here. Accordingly, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Stewart's testimony about DeCicco's missing expense documentation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> At the time of the fire, Chelsea was owed between $12,000 and $16,000 in real estate taxes. It had priority of payment from the insurance proceeds</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The appellant does concede that if<i>de novo</i> review does not apply, \"plain error\" is the proper standard of review.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> In his reply brief, the appellant admits as much. He concedes that his trial counsel did not use the term \"constructive amendment.\" He also notes that when he responded \"Okay\" after the district court had handed down its ruling that there could still be a mail fraud even absent the use-of-fire counts, he was simply acknowledging the court's position, not acquiescing in its correctness. This may be true, but however he characterizes his response, it was not sufficient to preserve his claim of error under the standard in Fed. R.Crim.P. 51(b). In the end, as we shall discuss, even had counsel preserved the objection, there was no error</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> As the government correctly points out, this second argument is not an argument that the appellant purportedly was prejudiced by a variance, but rather an argument that he was prejudiced by the admission of certain evidence. However, prejudice resulting from the admission of certain evidence is not what was meant by compromising \"substantial rights\" in the \"material variance\" context<i>See United States v. Tormos-Vega,</i> 959 F.2d 1103, 1115 (1st Cir.1992) (\"Substantial rights\" refers to the rights of a defendant to \"have sufficient knowledge of the charge against him in order to prepare an effective defense and avoid surprise at trial, and to prevent a second prosecution for the same offense.\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> In other words, Stewart's testimony about DeCicco's missing expense documentation was used to show that DeCicco was not as wealthy as he claimed. The fact that DeCicco could not produce documentation to support some of his claimed expenses could lead one to believe that perhaps DeCicco had expenses that were \"off the books.\" For example, perhaps he paid certain employees with cash in order to avoid payroll taxes. If this was the case and DeCicco did in fact have a number of additional expenses beyond those that were covered in his documentation, his net income would have been less than he had claimed it was. And if his net income was less than he claimed it was, he would have had difficulty paying off his debts. Thus, DeCicco did indeed have a motive to commit mail fraud. Such a fraud would have provided him with extra funds to pay off his income taxes, his property taxes, and his mortgages and commercial loans</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

DeCicco (\"appellant\") with four counts of mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341, in connection with claims for insurance proceeds submitted in the wake of two 1995 fires (Counts 1-4), and two counts of use of fire to commit a felony, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 844(h)(1) &amp; (2) (Counts 5-6). Although DeCicco was eventually acquitted on the use-of-fire counts, he was convicted on the four mail fraud counts. He now appeals this conviction. After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1989, DeCicco bought a building located at 17 Rear Heard Street in Chelsea, Massachusetts for $60,000. Earlier that year, before buying the building, he had applied to the City of Chelsea (\"Chelsea\") for a permit to use the building as a warehouse for two moving companies that he owned. The building, however, was surrounded by residential buildings and had only a narrow driveway providing access. Chelsea therefore denied the appellant's application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DeCicco nonetheless went ahead with the purchase. Although the building price was only $60,000, he obtained a loan of $104,000 from Somerset Bank, secured by a mortgage on the property. Notwithstanding the denial of the occupancy permit, DeCicco initially tried to use the building as a warehouse. He was, however, prevented from doing so by Chelsea. As a result, he ended up with a significant mortgage on a building he could not use for the purpose he desired. By August 1991, he was in arrears on the mortgage, and Somerset Bank informed him that it was intending to initiate foreclosure proceedings. Moreover, the appellant had two other obligations to Somerset Bank by this time: a $400,000 loan used to build a new warehouse in Revere, Massachusetts (\"Revere\"), and a short-term, $80,000 commercial loan. The appellant was falling behind on the Revere loan as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1991, DeCicco obtained insurance on the Rear Heard Street building from the Lincoln Insurance Company (\"Lincoln\"). However, he misrepresented that the premises were occupied, and after this fact was discovered upon inspection, Lincoln, on March 3, 1992, sent a cancellation notice by certified mail to the appellant. The notice advised the appellant that his insurance policy would be cancelled effective March 13, 1992 at 12:01 a.m.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Just twenty-nine hours before the insurance was to lapse, a fire occurred at the Rear Heard Street building. Investigators determined that the fire was intentionally set using a liquid accelerant at the base of the support pillars in a manner designed to bring the building down. The Fire Department responded quickly, however, and such little damage occurred that the appellant did not file a claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the cancellation of the Lincoln policy, the Rear Heard Street building went for three years without insurance. At some point during this period, the appellant retained Richard Stewart (\"Stewart\"), an accountant, to help him prepare income tax returns for the years 1992, 1993, and 1994. In December 1994, Stewart informed the appellant that, based on the information available to him and the draft returns he had prepared, the appellant owed $1,246,298 in federal and state taxes and penalties for 1992, 1993, and 1994. The draft returns reflected some deductions for expenses, but they did not reflect deductions for such business expenses as payroll. Based on Stewart's training and experience, he estimated that the appellant's tax liability might have been reduced by as much as ninety percent if the appellant had documentation for these expenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aside from his significant personal income tax liability, DeCicco also continued to have other financial issues during this period. He owed a total of $65,673.56 to Revere in property taxes. He was also in significant arrears on property taxes for the Rear Heard Street building in Chelsea. By July 1995, the amount he owed to Chelsea had ballooned to approximately $12,000. Finally, he still owed almost $95,000 to Somerset Bank in connection with the loan used to purchase the Rear Heard Street building, which was essentially vacant, and which he was expressly forbidden to use in connection with his moving companies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 1995, facing all of these financial pressures, DeCicco once again attempted to obtain insurance on the Rear Heard Street building. On May 17, 1995, the Scottsdale Insurance Company (\"Scottsdale\") issued the appellant an insurance policy providing coverage of up to $125,000 for the building.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Less than two months later, on July 9, 1995, the building was intentionally set on fire for a second time, with at least four separate fires started on the second floor of the warehouse. The Fire Department again responded quickly, and the fires were extinguished. However, twelve days later, on July 21, 1995, a third fire was intentionally set in the building in the early morning hours. This was a multiple-alarm fire, requiring Chelsea to call for aid from Revere, Everett, and Boston to fight the fire. It took approximately four hours to extinguish the blaze. In the end, the building was completely destroyed. The fire also damaged a neighboring garage; melted the siding on a nearby building; and destroyed the kitchen, bathroom, and pantry on the third floor of another building.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the extensive damage, Chelsea ordered the appellant to demolish what was left of the building. The appellant asked Kevin Mahoney (\"Mahoney\") to perform the work. Mahoney discussed the matter with his cousin, Randy Adamson, and then agreed to demolish the building for $13,800, a price that the appellant accepted. Mahoney and Adamson, using helpers and equipment, demolished the building and removed the rubble in approximately six days. The appellant paid Mahoney with an initial check of $4,000 and then later paid the remaining $9,800.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DeCicco then sought the assistance of a public claims adjustor, Terence Lynn (\"Lynn\"), to assist in filing his claim with Scottsdale, to recover pursuant to the insurance policy for the destruction of the building. However, almost immediately a number of points of contention arose between the appellant and Scottsdale. In early September 1995, in a communication between Lynn and Scottsdale regarding the appellant's claim, an issue arose regarding whether the building was vacant at the time of the fire. This was important, because according to the terms of the Scottsdale policy, recovery for a fire loss could be reduced by fifteen percent if the building was vacant when the fire occurred. On September 19, 1995, as this issue regarding vacancy was pending, the appellant's insurance broker, Justin Kaan, faxed to Lynn a document signed by the appellant and purporting to set forth certain items that were in the warehouse at the time of the fire, including dollies, a piano, a desk, chairs, and a couch. Scottsdale's fire investigator, however, saw no evidence of dollies or a piano when he examined the remains of the building after the fire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There were other controversies as well. On September 20, 1995, Lynn sent a letter to Scottsdale's representative, John Bottini (\"Bottini\"). Lynn wrote that \"I have enclosed a copy of the wrecking bill in the amount of $23,681, which was performed as a result of an emergency raze or repair order issued by the municipality shortly after the occurrence of the loss.\" The enclosed demolition bill purported to bear the signature of Arthur Adamson. However, according to Mahoney, who actually did the demolition work with Randy Adamson, DeCicco only paid $13,800, the agreed-upon price for the work. Furthermore, both Randy Adamson and his mother stated that the signature on the demolition bill submitted to Bottini was not that of Arthur Adamson (who died in 1997), nor was the bill on his letterhead.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 17, 1995, Lynn mailed to Bottini another letter in which he again mentioned the $23,681 demolition bill. Included with this letter was the partial sworn statement in proof of loss referenced in Count 1 of the indictment and a request for an advance payment of $25,000. In an attempt to get Scottsdale to issue this advance payment, Lynn's letter stated, among other things: \"We both know that Massachusetts is a so-called broad evidence rule state. The disagreements as to value and loss are still subject to indemnification of the insured whose indebtedness to the mortgagee as of this date of loss was $97,016.29 and who has incurred a wrecking bill of $23,681.\" Scottsdale thereafter forwarded Lynn a $25,000 check &#8212; the Count 2 mailing &#8212; which Lynn sent to Somerset Bank, which was named as a loss payee because of its mortgage on the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 2, 1996, Lynn sent a letter to Bottini enclosing a proposed sworn statement in proof of loss seeking to achieve a final settlement of the losses and again noting, among other things, that \"the incurred cost of wrecking the structure was $23,681. . . .\" Lynn also claimed in this letter that the appellant had made extensive renovations to the building, including installation of a hot air heating system, an electrical system, a two-piece bath, a new roof, skylights, and a $10,000 power lift. However, the appellant had told Bottini shortly after the fire that the warehouse had had neither heat nor electricity. Furthermore, Scottsdale's fire investigator saw no evidence of a power lift and noted that neither the heating system nor the electrical system had been operational at the time of the fire. Bottini was never provided with any documentation to support DeCicco's claimed improvements. He rejected the proposed proof of loss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bottini and Lynn eventually negotiated a settlement, and on February 7, 1996, Lynn sent Bottini a letter &#8212; the Count 3 mailing &#8212; containing a sworn proof of loss reflecting the settlement figures of $95,283 for the building and $23,681 for the demolition, for a total of $118,964. Bottini states that had he known that the actual cost of the demolition was less than $23,681, he would not have agreed to the final settlement amount, and had Scottsdale been aware that the actual amount incurred was less, it would not have paid that amount. Bottini, however, acknowledged that $23,681 was a fair figure for the demolition, given the building's size.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 27, 1996, Scottsdale sent a check to Lynn in the amount of $91,964 &#8212; the Count 4 mailing &#8212; the settlement amount minus two $1,000 deductibles and the $25,000 advance payment. That check listed as payees DeCicco, Lynn, Somerset Bank, and Chelsea.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> DeCicco took the check to a bank and deposited it. Although it appeared that the check had been endorsed by each of the payees, the endorsements of both Joseph Bianco on behalf of Somerset Bank and Alicia Silverberg on behalf of Chelsea were forged; indeed, no one named Alicia Silverberg had ever worked for the Chelsea City Treasurer's Office. Somerset Bank did ultimately receive insurance proceeds in the form of a Bank of Boston check from the appellant in the amount of $92,500, which satisfied the mortgage on the Rear Heard Street building in full. Bianco understood that this payment represented the Scottsdale insurance proceeds. Chelsea, however, never received payment for the real estate taxes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 27, 2000, the grand jury sitting in Boston returned its indictment, charging the appellant with four counts of mail fraud, and two counts of use of fire to commit a felony. With respect to the four mail fraud counts, the indictment alleged in one paragraph (paragraph 5) that DeCicco caused the destruction of the warehouse by fire. It alleged in a separate paragraph (paragraph 4) that \"following the damage by fire . . . [DeCicco] would and did cause the submission . . . of false and fraudulent claims for building loss insurance proceeds.\" The language of paragraph 4 does not make the alleged falsity of DeCicco's claims conditional upon any other acts on his part, nor does it specify that the claims were false for a certain reason. Paragraph 4 is therefore broad enough to support not just the theory that DeCicco's claims were fraudulent because he caused the fire, but also the theory that his claims were fraudulent for independent reasons, regardless of how the fire may have started. The other two counts, regarding use of fire to commit a felony, charged the appellant with violations of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 844(h)(1) &amp; (2) based on the fires that occurred at the Rear Heard Street building on July 9, 1995 and July 21, 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 14, 2003, prior to trial, the district court granted the appellant's motion to exclude evidence, pursuant to Fed. R.Evid. 403 and 404(b), regarding (1) the March 1992 fire that occurred at the same property involved in the indicted counts, and (2) testimony of Stewart, DeCicco's accountant, regarding DeCicco's income tax liabilities. The government appealed from this ruling, and this Court reversed the district court's exclusion of the evidence. <i>See United States v. DeCicco,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201051\"><a href=\"/opinion/201051/united-states-v-decicco/\"><span class=\"volume\">370</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">206</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2004) (\"<i>DeCicco I</i>\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case proceeded to trial on November 8, 2004. One of the government's key witnesses was the accountant Stewart, who testified not only about the amount of DeCicco's tax liability &#8212; the issue before this Court on the prior appeal &#8212; but also about the fact that Stewart had sought additional documentation from DeCicco to support claimed deductions which would have reduced DeCicco's tax liability. DeCicco objected to this additional testimony by Stewart. The district court, however, ruled that the testimony was admissible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the conclusion of the government's evidence, DeCicco made a motion, pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 29, that there was insufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, particularly as to the use-of-fire counts. The district court granted the appellant's motion for a required finding of not guilty as to one of the counts charging the appellant with use of fire to commit a felony but denied the motion as to the mail fraud counts and the other count charging use of fire to commit a felony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the appellant put on his case, he called several witnesses, including Terence Lynn, the public claims adjustor, and Lawrence Maddeford, who lived next to the Rear Heard Street building. Maddeford observed that kids would hang out at the building all the time, breaking through the boarded-up windows to gain access. Despite Maddeford registering numerous complaints with the police, the building essentially became a clubhouse for the kids for several years. After the fire destroyed the building, that was the end of the clubhouse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the conclusion of DeCicco's case, he renewed his Rule 29 motion. The district court entertained argument on the issue again, noting that although it had denied the motion with respect to Count Six (the remaining use-of-fire count), it would \"like the government's argument, in view of the fact there appears to be a witness [Maddeford] &#8212; seems to me a very credible witness &#8212; who raised a great doubt as to whether or not these what you call vagrants or kids constituted a nuisance did, in fact, cause the fire.\" After argument, the district court granted the appellant's motion for a required finding of not guilty as to the other count charging use of fire to commit a felony. The court also issued an order to the parties that they were not to argue to the jury during closing arguments that the appellant was, or was not, responsible for the fires.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 17, 2004, the jury found the appellant guilty on all four remaining mail fraud counts. The district court sentenced DeCicco to two years of probation, a $7,500 fine, and restitution of $9,881. It is this conviction that he appeals here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>II. Constructive amendment and material variance claims</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DeCicco's first claim is that there was a constructive amendment of his indictment, or alternatively, that there was a material variance between the indictment and proof that affected his substantial rights. In <i>United States v. Fisher,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194868\"><a href=\"/opinion/194868/united-states-v-fisher/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">456</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1993), we described the difference between a \"constructive amendment\" and a \"material variance\":</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A constructive amendment occurs when the charging terms of the indictment are altered, either literally or in effect, by prosecution or court after the grand jury has last passed upon them. A variance occurs when the charging terms remain unchanged but when the facts proved at trial are different from those alleged in the indictment. A constructive amendment is considered prejudicial per se and grounds for reversal of a conviction. Variance is grounds for reversal only if it affected the defendant's \"substantial rights\" &#8212; i.e., the rights to have sufficient knowledge of the charge against him in order to prepare an effective defense and avoid surprise at trial, and to prevent a second prosecution for the same offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 462-63 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); <i>see also United States v.

Standard of review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In assessing DeCicco's \"constructive amendment\" and \"material variance\" claims, we must first determine the appropriate standard of review. The appellant claims that because these issues were preserved through his objections at trial, <i>de novo</i> review is appropriate. The government argues in opposition that the appellant made no such objections; as a result, we should review for \"plain error.\" <i>See United States v. Olano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span>, 731, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Nevertheless, DeCicco argues here that these motions sufficed to preserve his objection that the district court would be constructively amending the indictment if it allowed him to be tried for a scheme to defraud other than the one charged in the indictment, namely, a scheme to cause the destruction of the Rear Heard Street building by fire in order to fraudulently claim insurance proceeds for the loss of the building. He also states that these motions were sufficient to preserve his objection that the district court was effecting a material variance between indictment and proof that affected his substantial rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We fail to see, however, how the motions cited by DeCicco can be deemed \"constructive amendment\" or \"material variance\" objections. Despite his attempt to spin them that way, the arguments he made in support of his motions were merely an articulation of his view that no charges would survive if the district court granted the motions, particularly with regard to the use-of-fire counts. Moreover, after the district court clearly stated its belief &#8212; twice &#8212; that the indictment comprehended the theory that the appellant had taken advantage of the fires by submitting false insurance claims, the appellant interposed no objection or argument that this would constitute a \"constructive amendment\" of the indictment or a \"material variance\" between indictment and proof. Under Fed.R.Crim.P. 51(b), a party may preserve a claim of error by informing the court &#8212; when the court ruling or order is made or sought &#8212; of the party's objection to the court's action and the grounds for that objection. Here, however, the appellant took no such action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of these facts, we believe that DeCicco did not preserve his objections and that the \"plain error\" test should apply in this instance. Under this standard, there must have been an error, the error must have been \"plain,\" and the error must have affected the substantial rights of the appellant. <i>See Olano,</i> 507 U.S. at 732, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Constructive amendment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant makes two separate \"constructive amendment\" claims. First, he reads the indictment to include one theory and one theory only: that he had devised a scheme to submit insurance claims to Scottsdale which were false and fraudulent <i>because he caused the fires</i> (i.e., as the one who started the fires, he was not entitled to any recovery). However, he notes that after the district court ruled that the government had presented insufficient evidence that DeCicco was responsible for the fires, the government shifted its theory in its closing arguments to discuss how the appellant had devised a scheme to submit insurance claims to Scottsdale which were false and fraudulent <i>for reasons entirely independent of whether he caused the fires.</i> When the government made this shift, he argues, it impermissibly broadened the possible bases for conviction beyond those set forth in the indictment returned by the grand jury. This shift in theory, from one in which DeCicco's responsibility for the fires was an essential component of the fraudulent scheme to one in which it was unnecessary, constituted a constructive amendment of the indictment in violation of the Fifth Amendment Grand Jury clause. This shift broadened the scheme charged in the indictment because it permitted his conviction to rest on claims for insurance proceeds which were fraudulent for <i>any</i> reason, not just because DeCicco was responsible for the fires.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant, however, misreads the indictment. He is incorrect in maintaining that the indictment did not encompass claims for insurance proceeds that were fraudulent for reasons other than that he had caused the fires. The indictment alleged, in two separate and distinct paragraphs, two separate and distinct ways in which the appellant perpetrated mail fraud: (1) by causing the submission to Scottsdale of false and fraudulent claims for building loss insurance proceeds, and (2) by actually causing the damage to and destruction of the Rear Heard Street building by fire. In other words, the indictment contained two completely separate theories. In the first theory, DeCicco committed mail fraud because he submitted false and fraudulent claims for insurance proceeds after the fire, however it may have started. In the second theory, the appellant committed mail fraud for a different reason. The claims that he submitted were false and fraudulent because <i>he caused the fire</i> (and therefore was not entitled to any recovery).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the mail fraud counts of the indictment were not dependent on the theory that the appellant had caused the fires. Instead, they were so fashioned as to comprehend that one could take advantage of a fire and commit mail fraud even without having caused the fire. In other words, the appellant's misrepresentations &#8212; for example, in the fraudulent demolition bill or in the phony list of property in the warehouse at the time of the fire or in the letter sent by Lynn to Bottini listing improvements made to the property by DeCicco &#8212; could be used to show he committed mail fraud, regardless of whether he started the fires. As such, when the government made the shift complained of by the appellant, the government was not exceeding the scope of the indictment but was merely operating with its confines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both parties point to the Supreme Court's decision in <i>United States v. Miller,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111404\"><a href=\"/opinion/111404/united-states-v-miller/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">130</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111404\"><a href=\"/opinion/111404/united-states-v-miller/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">99</span></a></span> (1985), to support their respective positions. We think <i>Miller</i> clearly shows that there was no \"constructive amendment\" in this case. In <i>Miller,</i> the defendant was convicted of two counts of mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341. The indictment in the case alleged a scheme to defraud with two distinct components; specifically, the indictment alleged <i>both</i> that the defendant had defrauded his insurer by consenting to a burglary in advance <i>and</i> by then lying to the insurer regarding the amount of copper wire which was stolen during that burglary. The trial evidence, however, went only to the allegation that the defendant had lied regarding his copper-wire claim. The government moved to strike the portion of the indictment that alleged the defendant's pre-knowledge of the burglary, but, when the defendant opposed that motion, the entire indictment went to the jury. The defendant was convicted, and on appeal, complained that both prongs of his indictment were not satisfied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court affirmed Miller's conviction, finding that the pre-knowledge of the burglary in Miller's indictment constituted a segregable component of the charged scheme to defraud, and that the evidence presented regarding the inflated copper-wire claim was sufficient to support a conviction. The Court noted that nothing new was added to the grand jury's indictment and that \"Miller was tried on an indictment that clearly set out the offense for which he was ultimately convicted.\" <i>Miller,</i> 471 U.S. at 140, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111404\"><a href=\"/opinion/111404/united-states-v-miller/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1811</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the present case, the indictment similarly contains two distinct and segregable components. As we have demonstrated above, and contrary to the appellant's assertion that the indictment in this case \"did not specify any separable, independently fraudulent scheme on which conviction based on a narrower scheme than that charged in the indictment might validly rest,\" the indictment at issue here alleged two separate and distinct ways in which the appellant perpetrated mail fraud, neither of which was dependent on the other. And just as in <i>Miller,</i> where the removal of the allegation of complicity in the burglary resulted in a permissible narrowing of the indictment, leaving intact the theory that the defendant had submitted inflated insurance claims, so too could the deletion of the allegation of complicity in the fires here result in a permissible narrowing of the indictment, leaving intact the separate theory that the appellant had submitted claims that were false and fraudulent for reasons unrelated to whether he had started the fires.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DeCicco's second \"constructive amendment\" claim is as follows: The indictment charged him with submitting false and fraudulent claims for <i>building loss</i> insurance proceeds, but the centerpiece of the government's argument to the jury urging it to convict DeCicco of mail fraud was not a false and fraudulent claim for <i>building loss</i> insurance proceeds at all &#8212; it was a claim for reimbursement for <i>demolition</i> expenses which the government contended was falsely inflated. DeCicco supports his argument by pointing to how the Scottsdale insurance settlement had two independent components: one amount for the loss of the building, and another amount for the demolition costs. The two were completely separate. He similarly notes how the Scottsdale policy expressly differentiates between building loss and debris removal. In his eyes, the government's reliance on the demolition bill created the strong possibility that he was convicted of an offense other than that charged by the grand jury. This, therefore, constituted a constructive amendment of the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We, however, do not find this argument convincing. The indictment is not tied to any particular provision of the settlement agreement or the Scottsdale policy. As a result, we believe that the grand jury, when issuing its indictment, was speaking generically about \"building loss\" and was not using the specific definition of that phrase as provided for in the settlement agreement or the Scottsdale policy. We also think it inconceivable that the grand jury in this instance would issue an indictment limited only to \"building loss\" proceeds, as that term was used in the settlement agreement or the Scottsdale policy, when there was ample evidence that the appellant had also submitted false and fraudulent claims relating to \"demolition\" or \"debris removal\" expenses, as <i>those</i> terms were used in the settlement agreement and the Scottsdale policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find, therefore, that there was no \"constructive amendment\" of the indictment in this instance. Since there was no error, appellant cannot possibly satisfy the \"plain error\" standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Material variance</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if there was no constructive amendment, the appellant argues that there was, at a minimum, a material variance between indictment and proof. In this iteration of his argument, appellant concedes that the charging terms of the indictment are not in dispute. However, he claims that the facts proved at trial were different from those alleged in the indictment. In his view, the indictment alleged facts relating to one theory &#8212; namely, that his insurance claims were false and fraudulent because he had caused the fires to occur. The facts presented at trial, however, related to another theory &#8212; that his insurance claims were false and fraudulent because he had submitted false documentation in support of his claims. This was a variance, and it was one that affected his \"substantial rights\" in two ways: 1) he had insufficient notice to be able to prepare an effective defense to the new theory which the government argued to the jury; and 2) he was prejudiced by the continuing use of evidence which had been admitted solely because it was relevant to the use-of-fire counts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This claim, however, fails at its foundation. Once again, the appellant misconstrues the indictment. As we related above, the indictment clearly comprehended the theory that DeCicco's insurance claims were false and fraudulent for reasons unrelated to whether he had caused the fires. In particular, they were false and fraudulent because he had submitted false documentation in support of his claims. The sworn statements in proof of loss and the insurance settlement checks discussed in the indictment clearly related to this theory. Moreover, the facts that were presented at trial related to this theory. For example, facts were presented that he had provided a false demolition bill, that he had provided a phony list of property in the warehouse at the time of the fire, and that he had falsely listed improvements made to the property in the letter sent to Bottini. These falsities all led to the fraudulent sworn statements in proof of loss referenced in the indictment and were what prompted the insurance settlement checks sent by Scottsdale that were also referenced in the indictment. Thus, the facts proved at trial were not different from those alleged in the indictment, and there was no variance. Since there was no variance, we do not reach the question of whether such an alleged variance was material or whether the appellant's substantial rights were affected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p>III. Potential violation of the district court's order</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant next argues that the government committed reversible misconduct in its closing arguments to the jury. Before the closing arguments commenced, the district court instructed the parties that they were not to argue to the jury that DeCicco was, or was not, responsible for the fires. The appellant here argues that the government violated this order when it explicitly argued to the jury that DeCicco had a motive to want the building <i>gone.</i> Such an argument, contends the appellant, the jury could only have interpreted as suggesting DeCicco's responsibility for the fires. Appellant, in particular, points to the following statements by the government during closing arguments:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now finally, there was this argument that the defendant got nothing out of this. I suggest to you, just use your common sense. You've got a building that's useless. You've got a building that people are chasing you after. You've got a building where your tax liabilities for the property are ballooning as time goes on. And you owe the bank a lot of money. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>This defendant had every incentive to want that building gone, to be rid of that building.</i> And by getting [Scottsdale] to get him off the hook and basically pay the entire mortgage, everything that was due and owing to the bank on that, as well as everything he had to pay to Kevin Mahoney and Randy Adamson to take the building down, you can't say that the defendant got nothing. He got the entire benefit of that. He got completely free and clear of that horrible investment that he made for whatever reason back in 1989.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial Tr. 5-93-94 (emphasis added). This argument, the appellant argues, was highly prejudicial and warrants reversal of his conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this issue, the appropriate standard of review is clear. Because DeCicco did not object to the government's closing arguments, we review for plain error. <i>See Olano,</i> 507 U.S. at 732, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1770</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reviewing the record, we do not believe that the government violated the district court's order when it stated that the appellant \"had every incentive to want that building gone, to be rid of that building.\" For several reasons, we think that in making such a statement, the government was addressing the appellant's desire to have the building gone in an economic sense (as in \"gone from his portfolio\"). We also think this is how a jury would have understood such a statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, and most importantly, we look at the context in which these words were uttered. At the time the government made the statement at issue here, it was discussing the nature of appellant's investments, tax liabilities, and mortgages. The government was not discussing any allegations that the appellant was responsible for the fires. The context of the government's statement leads us to believe that the government desired only to discuss how the appellant sought to maximize his recovery from Scottsdale and rid himself entirely of a horrible investment through the submission of false claims. <i>See Whitman v.

Appellant's counsel had stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I just want to point out to you again what I've said all along. When you're out there deliberating, remember, Gary got nothing out of this. It cost Gary money out of his pocket. Gary lost an asset, a building, that although it was tough to get to, was described as the triple-thick walls, huge beams, a good, solid building he had and he lost.

The government's statement was an attempt to address this argument. In stating that the appellant \"had every incentive to want that building gone, to be rid of that building,\" the government was attempting to counter the appellant's argument and show that the appellant did indeed reap a benefit from the alleged mail fraud. The complained-of statement addressed the appellant's motive in committing the fraud &#8212; namely his desire to have a troublesome financial investment removed from his portfolio by having Scottsdale pay off his mortgage and the entire cost of demolition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore find that the government did not violate the district court's order to refrain from discussing the appellant's responsibility for the fires.

We review the admission of evidence under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b) for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v.

We also found that the evidence was not excludable under Fed.R.Evid. 403, because \"when offered for the limited purpose of showing motive, and viewed in the context of the government's charges, any danger of unfair prejudice in this case is minimal.\" <i>DeCicco,</i> 370 F.3d at 214.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Stewart's testimony was offered at trial, the government informed the district court that it intended to elicit from Stewart not just the amount of tax liability which he had calculated &#8212; the issue before this Court in <i>DeCicco I</i>&#8212; but also that Stewart had sought additional documentation from DeCicco to support claimed deductions which would have reduced DeCicco's tax liability to about ten percent of what Stewart had calculated. The appellant objected to this additional testimony by Stewart. The district court, however, ruled that the testimony was admissible because this Court said that it was.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant contests this ruling, noting that although this Court has ruled that Stewart's testimony regarding DeCicco's tax liabilities was admissible under Fed. R.Evid. 404(b), the question of Stewart's testimony regarding DeCicco's failure to provide him with documentation supporting expenses he claimed as deductions was not before the Court. Contrary to the district court's position, appellant argues that this Court's decision in <i>DeCicco I</i> did not require it to admit this portion of Stewart's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe that the district court made the correct decision in admitting the evidence. Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) provides that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity or absence of mistake. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). Therefore, as we noted in <i>DeCicco I,</i> \"mere propensity evidence is never admissible solely to show a character inclined towards unlawful behavior. The same evidence may be admissible, however, even if it may be construed as propensity evidence, if it is used to show any of the other elements set out in the rule.\" <i>DeCicco,</i> 370 F.3d at 210-11 (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We use a two-part test to evaluate the admissibility of evidence under Rule 404(b). First, we must determine whether the evidence in question has any \"special relevance\" exclusive of defendant's character or propensity. <i>See United States v. Sebaggala,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199496\"><a href=\"/opinion/199496/united-states-v-sebaggala/\"><span class=\"volume\">256</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span>, 67 (1st Cir.2001) (the proffered evidence \"must not merely show a defendant's reprehensible character or predisposition toward knavery. . . .\"). Second, even if some \"special relevance\" is found, the evidence must nonetheless be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. \"Rule 404(b) incorporates <i>sub silentio</i> the prophylaxis of Federal Rule of Evidence 403.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regarding the first prong of the test, the appellant argues that \"Stewart's testimony regarding DeCicco's failure to provide him with the documentation necessary to reduce his tax liability by 90% was not relevant to the question of DeCicco's motive to commit arson or mail fraud, nor did the government ever articulate a basis for its admissibility under Rule 404(b).\" He states that this was evidence which the jury would have used purely for propensity purposes. In his eyes, the jury would draw only two conclusions from this evidence: (1) that DeCicco had misrepresented his business expenses to Stewart in hopes of limiting his tax liability, and (2) that his businesses must have been conducted dishonestly if he could not produce even something so routine as payroll records. Thus, the jury would have reasoned that because DeCicco had attempted to defraud the federal and state taxing authorities and because he must have been conducting his businesses in a dishonest manner, as evidenced by the lack of even the most routine recordkeeping, he was more likely to have perpetrated a fraud on Scottsdale. As such, he argues, this evidence was pure propensity evidence and should not have been admitted under the first prong of Rule 404(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We, however, believe that Stewart's testimony relating to the missing expense documentation contained a \"special relevance\" exclusive of DeCicco's character and propensity. In particular, such testimony was relevant to DeCicco's motive for committing the charged mail fraud offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>DeCicco I,</i> we came to a similar conclusion when we stated that Stewart's testimony relating to DeCicco's tax liabilities could be used \"in order to show for what purpose the fraudulently obtained insurance proceeds were intended\" &#8212; i.e., to show that the money obtained from Scottsdale would be used to defray DeCicco's tax liabilities. <i>DeCicco,</i> 370 F.3d at 214. In this appeal, we find that Stewart's testimony relating to the missing expense documentation also related to DeCicco's motive, but in a different way. In his opening, DeCicco had argued that he had to have been making a lot of money to generate such large tax liabilities and therefore had no motive to commit the charged fraud. Stewart's testimony relating to the missing expense documentation helped provide a response to this contention. It was used to show that the appellant's net income was likely significantly less than the available documentation suggested and that the appellant likely did not have money on hand to pay what he owed. Thus, Stewart's testimony helped the government demonstrate that DeCicco did indeed have a motive to fraudulently obtain insurance proceeds from Scottsdale &#8212; i.e., the alleged mail fraud provided him with the funds he needed to pay his debts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant also argues that Stewart's testimony should be excluded under Fed.R.Evid. 403, which is incorporated into the second prong of the Rule 404(b) test, because any probative value which Stewart's testimony had was substantially outweighed by the effect of unfair prejudice. However, this argument fails as well, because, as we stated in <i>DeCicco I,</i> \"we are of the view that, when offered for the limited purpose of showing motive, and viewed in the context of the government's charges, any danger of unfair prejudice in this case is minimal.\" <i>DeCicco,</i> 370 F.3d at 214. We continue to hold this belief, and it is fatal to DeCicco's claim here. Accordingly, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Stewart's testimony about DeCicco's missing expense documentation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> At the time of the fire, Chelsea was owed between $12,000 and $16,000 in real estate taxes. It had priority of payment from the insurance proceeds</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The appellant does concede that if<i>de novo</i> review does not apply, \"plain error\" is the proper standard of review.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> In his reply brief, the appellant admits as much. He concedes that his trial counsel did not use the term \"constructive amendment.\" He also notes that when he responded \"Okay\" after the district court had handed down its ruling that there could still be a mail fraud even absent the use-of-fire counts, he was simply acknowledging the court's position, not acquiescing in its correctness. This may be true, but however he characterizes his response, it was not sufficient to preserve his claim of error under the standard in Fed. R.Crim.P. 51(b). In the end, as we shall discuss, even had counsel preserved the objection, there was no error</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> As the government correctly points out, this second argument is not an argument that the appellant purportedly was prejudiced by a variance, but rather an argument that he was prejudiced by the admission of certain evidence. However, prejudice resulting from the admission of certain evidence is not what was meant by compromising \"substantial rights\" in the \"material variance\" context<i>See United States v. Tormos-Vega,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580292\"><a href=\"/opinion/580292/united-states-v-jose-tormos-vega-united-states-of-america-v-juan-luis/\"><span class=\"volume\">959</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1103</span></a></span>, 1115 (1st Cir.1992) (\"Substantial rights\" refers to the rights of a defendant to \"have sufficient knowledge of the charge against him in order to prepare an effective defense and avoid surprise at trial, and to prevent a second prosecution for the same offense.\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> In other words, Stewart's testimony about DeCicco's missing expense documentation was used to show that DeCicco was not as wealthy as he claimed. The fact that DeCicco could not produce documentation to support some of his claimed expenses could lead one to believe that perhaps DeCicco had expenses that were \"off the books.\" For example, perhaps he paid certain employees with cash in order to avoid payroll taxes. If this was the case and DeCicco did in fact have a number of additional expenses beyond those that were covered in his documentation, his net income would have been less than he had claimed it was. And if his net income was less than he claimed it was, he would have had difficulty paying off his debts. Thus, DeCicco did indeed have a motive to commit mail fraud. Such a fraud would have provided him with extra funds to pay off his income taxes, his property taxes, and his mortgages and commercial loans</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
