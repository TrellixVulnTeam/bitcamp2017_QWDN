After pleading guilty to crimes\n\nthat carry a statutorily imposed minimum sentence, John Andrew\n\nAhlers and Peter Jordan Ahlers asked the district court to consider\n\ndeparting below that minimum based on grounds unrelated to their\n\nsubstantial assistance to the authorities.           The district court\n\nruled that it lacked the authority, under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e), to\n\nhonor this request.       Armed with nothing but the sharp point of\n\nstatutory language, the Ahlers brothers present us with the direct\n\nquestion of whether a government motion for a downward departure to\n\nreflect a defendant's substantial assistance removes the constraint\nof   a   statutory     minimum   sentence    and   opens   the    door   for\n\nconsideration     of   departure   grounds   unrelated     to    substantial\nassistance.   We hold that a substantial assistance motion does not\nhave so liberating an effect.      Accordingly, we affirm the district\n\ncourt's assessment of the limits that Congress placed upon its\nsentencing authority under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e).\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           During the 1990s, a drug kingpin, Robert Shimek, directed\na large-scale illicit enterprise reaching from Canada to New\nOrleans.   Typically, Shimek's henchmen would deposit illegal drugs\n\n- marijuana, ecstacy, hashish, LSD, and the like - at remote\n\nlocations in Canada (usually near Vermont or Maine); runners would\n\nsmuggle the contraband in backpacks across the border and return\n\nwith the proceeds of previously consummated drug sales; their\n\naccomplices in the United States would repackage the drugs for\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fdistribution; and other participants would market them at music\n\nconcerts and elsewhere.\n\n          For a period of roughly six months, the Ahlers brothers\nworked the channels of this underground empire, driving Shimek to\n\nvarious concerts, acting as couriers, and selling drugs.                In\n\nOctober of 1997, their swift chariot spun off the fast track:           a\nFlorida state trooper apprehended them driving a vehicle that\n\ncontained two large nitrous oxide tanks, sheets of LSD, marijuana,\n\nand sundry drug paraphernalia.       They were found guilty of state\n\ndrug-trafficking charges and sentenced to serve 60 days in jail\n\n(with additional time suspended). They maintain, with considerable\n\nsupport in the record, that upon their release they ended their\n\nintercourse with Shimek, kept to the straight and narrow, and\npursued exemplary lifestyles.\n\n          Notwithstanding this about-face, the past came back to\n\nhaunt them.   On June 21, 2000, a federal grand jury handed up a\nthree-count   indictment   arising   out   of   their   participation   in\n\nShimek's network.   Count 1 alleged that the brothers conspired to\n\ndistribute, and to possess with intent to distribute, various\n\ncontrolled substances.      Count 2 alleged that they conspired to\n\nimport various controlled substances into the United States. Count\n\n3 alleged that they possessed various controlled substances with\n\nintent to distribute.      See 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)-(b), 846, 952(a)-\n\n(b), 960(a)-(b), 963. On February 7, 2001, both men pleaded guilty\n\nto count 1 of the indictment.\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\f             After    tabulating      all       the   drugs   associated   with    the\n\noffense of conviction and converting them to their marijuana\n\nequivalent, see USSG §2D1.1, the probation department compiled a\npresentence investigation report (PSI Report) that attributed a\n\ntotal of 267 kilograms of marijuana equivalent to the defendants.\n\nCrediting    each     of   them   with      a    three-level    downward   dip     for\nacceptance of responsibility, USSG §3E1.1, the PSI Report proposed\n\nan adjusted offense level of 23.                      This produced a guideline\n\nsentencing range (GSR) of 51-63 months for John Ahlers (who was\n\nranked in criminal history category II) and 57-71 months for Peter\n\nAhlers (who was ranked in criminal history category III). Finally,\n\nthe PSI Report noted that, by statute, the offense of conviction\n\ncalled for a mandatory minimum sentence of 60 months.                           See 21\n\nU.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B).\n\n             At the disposition hearing, the government asked the\n\ncourt   to   depart    downward       to    reflect     the   Ahlers'   substantial\nassistance in the investigation of others.                       See 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3553(e); USSG §5K1.1. At the same time, the Ahlers cross-moved for\n\nadditional     departures         based         on    extraordinary     presentence\n\nrehabilitation.       See United States v. Craven, 239 F.3d 91, 99 (1st\n\nCir. 2001) (discussing such departures); United States v. Sklar,\n\n920 F.2d 107, 115-17 (1st Cir. 1990) (similar); see generally USSG\n\n§5K2.0.      Pursuant      to   the   plea      agreement,     the   district    court\n\ndismissed counts 2 and 3 of the indictment.                   It then granted each\n\ndefendant a 21-month downward departure for substantial assistance,\n\nbut stopped there.         The court took the position that it did not\n\n                                           -5-\n\fhave any authority to further depreciate the statutory minimum\n\nsentence       based    on    a   ground     (like     extraordinary     presentence\n\nrehabilitation)          unrelated      to       the     defendants'     substantial\nassistance.\n\n               Each defendant appeals from his 39-month incarcerative\n\nsentence,      challenging        the   \"lack     of    authority\"     holding.     We\nconsolidated the appeals for briefing and argument.\n\nII.    ANALYSIS\n\n               As said, the sole issue on appeal concerns the court's\n\npower to depart below the statutory minimum sentence on a ground\nunrelated to substantial assistance.                   Appellate jurisdiction from\n\na denial of a departure request attaches when the sentencing court\nbases its action on a perception that it lacks the legal authority\nto grant the request.             See United States v. Pierro, 32 F.3d 611,\n\n619 (1st Cir. 1994); United States v. Mariano, 983 F.2d 1150, 1153-\n54 (1st Cir. 1993).           Because the court below premised its refusal\nto    depart    on     such   a    perceived     lack     of   authority,   we    have\n\njurisdiction to hear and determine these appeals.                      Moreover, the\nappeals     hinge      on     a   quintessentially         legal     judgment,    thus\nengendering plenary review.             Mariano, 983 F.2d at 1154.\n\n               Whether there is anything of substance to be decided is\nanother matter. Citing United States v. Chestna, 962 F.2d 103 (1st\n\nCir. 1992) (per curiam), the government hypothesizes that the issue\n\nraised in these appeals is barred by the doctrine of stare decisis.\n\nWe start by testing that hypothesis.\n\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\f             In Chestna, the government moved pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3553(e) and USSG §5K1.1 for a downward departure reflecting the\n\ndefendant's       substantial    assistance.1        962     F.2d   at   104.     The\ndefendant simultaneously moved for a downward departure based on\n\nher unique family responsibilities.              Id. at 104-05.      She contended\n\nthat the government's motion for a substantial assistance departure\nopened the door for consideration of other factors in determining\n\nthe degree of the departure.             Id. at 105.   We upheld the district\n\ncourt's rejection of her claim.                 Id. at 106 (stating that any\n\nadditional     factor    not    specifically        listed    in    section     5K1.1\n\n\"necessarily would relate to the substance of the initiating\n\nmotion, i.e., a defendant's substantial assistance,\" in order to\n\naffect the extent of the departure).\n             Contrary to the government's importunings, our decision\n\nin Chestna does not conclusively refute the Ahlers' argument.                     In\n\nthat case, the defendant posited that a sentencing court could take\ninto account a factor unrelated to substantial assistance - family\n\ncircumstances - when determining the extent of such a departure.\nThe Ahlers, however, did not ask the lower court to consider an\n\nextraneous factor (in their case, rehabilitation) as a basis for\n\nenlarging     a    substantial       assistance     departure,      but,      rather,\n\nproffered    that    factor     as   a   separate    and   distinct      ground   for\n\n\n\n     1\n      In 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e), quoted infra, Congress ordained that\na substantial assistance departure could trump a statutorily\nimposed mandatory minimum sentence. USSG §5K1.1 is the principal\nguideline adopted by the Sentencing Commission to aid district\ncourts in fashioning substantial assistance departures.\n\n                                          -7-\n\fdeparture.    This is an issue that we did not reach in Chestna.              See\n\nid. at 107.      We reach it here.\n\n            As     framed,    the   Ahlers'    argument    relies    on   their\ninterpretation of 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e).           That statute reads:\n\n            Limited authority to impose a sentence below a\n            statutory   minimum.-Upon   motion  from   the\n            Government, the court shall have the authority\n            to impose a sentence below a level established\n            by statute as minimum sentence so as to\n            reflect a defendant's substantial assistance\n            in the investigation or prosecution of another\n            person who has committed an offense.      Such\n            sentence shall be imposed in accordance with\n            the guidelines and policy statements issued by\n            the Sentencing Commission pursuant to section\n            994 of title 28, United States Code.\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(e).\n             The Ahlers asseverate that when a sentencing court grants\n\na government motion for a substantial assistance departure, the\nfirst textual sentence of this provision renders nugatory any\nstatutory minimum penal sentence, and that the second textual\n\nsentence restores the court's full powers under the sentencing\nguidelines to depart on other grounds (as if no mandatory minimum\nexisted).     In the Ahlers' view, this means that the granting of a\ngovernment motion pursuant to section 3553(e) invariably authorizes\n\nthe sentencing court to impose a sentence below an otherwise\napplicable       statutory    mandatory     minimum   based   not    merely    on\n\nsubstantial assistance but also on any other ground recognized\nunder the guidelines.          Thus, their thesis runs, the sentencing\ncourt   should      have     entertained    departure     requests   based     on\n\nextraordinary presentence rehabilitation.\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\f            The force of this argument depends on the meaning of the\n\nwords that Congress wrote.     To determine that meaning, we start\n\nwith the language of the statute.       United States v. Charles George\n\nTrucking Co., 823 F.2d 685, 688 (1st Cir. 1987).        \"In searching a\n\nstatute's text for a pellucid expression of congressional intent,\n\nwe . . . make a commonsense concession that meaning can only be\nascribed to    statutory   language   if   that   language   is   taken   in\n\ncontext.\"    Riva v. Commonwealth of Mass., 61 F.3d 1003, 1007 (1st\n\nCir. 1995).     We presume that Congress intended all words and\n\nprovisions contained within a statute to have meaning and effect,\n\nand we will not readily adopt any construction that renders any\n\nsuch words or phrases meaningless, redundant, or superfluous.\n\nLopez-Soto v. Hawayek, 175 F.3d 170, 173 (1st Cir. 1999).\n            Based on the foregoing, it is apparent that our move from\n\nthe general to the specific necessitates establishing the context\n\nfrom which the particular statute speaks.         Riva, 61 F.3d at 1007.\n\nThrough the enactment of 18 U.S.C. § 3553, Congress directed the\n\nfederal courts as to how they should carry out their sentencing\nresponsibilities in criminal cases.        Subsections (a) through (d)\n\nestablish the criteria and procedures to which a court must look in\n\nimposing sentence.    Subsections (e) and (f) deal with a court's\n\npower to afford relief from statutorily imposed minimum sentences.\n\nComparing the form and function of these latter two subsections\n\nshould provide a panoramic view of the exceptions that Congress\n\nwished to create to the otherwise mandatory imposition of statutory\n\nminimum sentences.\n\n                                  -9-\n\f           This approach requires that we compare the language of\n\nsection 3553(e) (the provision at issue in this case) with the\n\nlanguage of section 3553(f) (the only other proviso in section 3553\ndealing   with   mandatory   minimum    sentences).   Doing   so,   the\n\nconclusion is inescapable that the language Congress used in these\n\ntwo sections differs radically - and that difference hardly can be\ndismissed as a mere fortuity.\n\n           18 U.S.C. § 3553(f) - the so-called \"safety valve\"\n\nprovision - reads as follows:\n\n           Limitation on applicability of statutory\n           minimums in certain cases.-Notwithstanding any\n           other provision of law, in the case of an\n           offense under [specified sections of the\n           criminal code not relevant here], the court\n           shall impose a sentence pursuant to guidelines\n           promulgated by the United States Sentencing\n           Commission under Section 994 of title 28\n           without regard to any statutory minimum\n           sentence, if the court finds at sentencing,\n           after the Government has been afforded the\n           opportunity to make a recommendation, that -\n           (1) the defendant does not have more than 1\n           criminal history point, as determined under\n           the sentencing guidelines;\n           (2) the defendant did not use violence or\n           credible threats of violence or possess a\n           firearm or other dangerous weapon (or induce\n           another participant to do so) in connection\n           with the offense;\n           (3) the offense did not result in death or\n           serious bodily injury to any person;\n           (4) the defendant was not an organizer,\n           leader, manager, or supervisor of others in\n           the   offense,   as   determined   under   the\n           sentencing guidelines and was not engaged in a\n           continuing criminal enterprise, as defined in\n           section 408 of the Controlled Substances Act;\n           and\n           (5) not later than the time of the sentencing\n           hearing, the defendant has truthfully provided\n           to the Government all information and evidence\n           the defendant has concerning the offense or\n\n                                 -10-\n\f              offenses that were part of the same course of\n              conduct or of a common scheme or plan, but the\n              fact that the defendant has no relevant or\n              useful other information to provide or that\n              the Government is already aware of the\n              information shall not preclude a determination\n              by the court that the defendant has complied\n              with this requirement.\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(f).2       In United States v. Ortiz-Santiago, 211 F.3d\n\n146 (1st Cir. 2000), we elaborated on the form and function of this\n\nprovision. We recognized that Congress enacted the safety valve to\n\nmitigate the harsh effects of mandatory minimum sentences on\n\ncertain first-time offenders who played relatively minor roles in\n\ndrug-trafficking schemes.        Id. at 150.\n\n              The clear and precise language that Congress used to\nachieve this objective is striking.        Congress unequivocally stated\n\nthat as long as a certain set of conditions were met, courts should\n\n\"[dis]regard . . . any statutory minimum sentence\" and sentence in\naccordance with the sentencing guidelines, \"[n]otwithstanding any\n\nother provision of law . . . .\"            18 U.S.C. § 3553(f).          Thus,\n\nsection   3553(f)     demonstrates      Congress's     ability      to   deploy\n\nunambiguous     statutory    language   when   it    intends   to    authorize\n\nsentencing judges to ignore the limitations imposed by statutory\n\nminimum sentences and treat a \"mandatory minimum\" case like any\n\nother.\n\n              Section 3553(e) speaks in much more circumspect terms.\n\nThe   first    textual   sentence   presumes    the    applicability      of   a\n\n\n\n      2\n      It is undisputed that neither of the defendants in this case\nqualifies for the safety valve.\n\n                                    -11-\n\fstatutorily established minimum penal sentence, ascribes the force\n\nof   law   to    that   sentence,     and     grants   a    sentencing   court\n\ndiscretionary     authority   to     impose    a   lesser    sentence    -   but\nconditions that authority upon the filing of a government motion.\n\nSignificantly, that textual sentence limits the authority to depart\n\nto the extent necessary \"so as to reflect a defendant's substantial\nassistance . . . .\"       18 U.S.C. § 3553(e).             The second textual\n\nsentence of section 3553(e) - the sentence upon which the Ahlers\n\nchiefly rely - modifies its subject (\"sentence\") with the adjective\n\n\"such,\" thus referring back to the penal sentence contemplated in\n\nthe first textual sentence.         Unlike section 3553(f) - under which\n\nthe mandatory minimum is to be disregarded once certain conditions\n\nare met - section 3553(e) retains the mandatory minimum as a\nreference point for a specific, carefully circumscribed type of\n\ndeparture.3     See United States v. Aponte, 36 F.3d 1050, 1051 (11th\n\nCir. 1994).      The sharp divergence between these regimes leads\ninexorably to the conclusion that Congress had different plans in\n\nmind for the operation and effect of the two provisions.\n\n\n     3\n      In this sense, section 3553(e) provides the only authority\nfor a court to sentence below a statutory minimum.       After all,\nthere is no statutory minimum applicable to a defendant who reaches\nthe safe harbor of the safety valve provision. See Ortiz-Santiago,\n211 F.3d at 150.      This demonstrates a fundamental difference\nbetween subsections (e) and (f): 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e) recognizes\nand respects the sentence \"established by statute as [a] minimum\nsentence\" and does not explicitly confer upon sentencing courts a\npower to disregard it (instead granting limited authority to\nsentence below it).     In marked contrast, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f)\ndirects courts to sentence \"without regard to any statutory minimum\nsentence,\" thus completely removing the erstwhile mandatory minimum\nfrom the sentencing calculus.\n\n                                     -12-\n\f               The   Ahlers   ignore   this    difference,    modeling     their\n\nrendition of section 3553(e) after the actual operation of section\n\n3553(f).       But they offer no explanation as to why two provisions\nwith such different architecture and such different goals should be\n\ndeemed to march in lockstep.             It is accepted lore that when\n\nCongress uses certain words in one part of a statute, but omits\nthem in another, an inquiring court should presume that this\n\ndifferential draftsmanship was deliberate. Lopez-Soto, 175 F.3d at\n\n173.       So it is here.\n\n               We think that the unique language in which Congress\n\ncouched section 3553(e) manifests an obvious purpose:                   once the\n\ngovernment      moves   for   a   sentence    below   the   statutory    minimum\n\npursuant to section 3553(e), the court has discretion to sentence\nbelow that minimum in a manner that reflects the nature and extent\n\nof the substantial assistance provided by the defendant - no more,\n\nno less.       This construction is supported most clearly in the text\nby the placement of the limiting phrase \"so as to reflect a\n\ndefendant's substantial assistance,\" which is attached to the main\n\nclause that grants the court its authority to impose a sentence\n\nbelow the statutory minimum. From this placement, the only logical\n\nconclusion is that the authority granted is limited thereby.4\n\n\n       4\n      The Ahlers' reading of this sentence - that it completely\nfrees a court from the restraints of a statutory minimum penal\nsentence once the court grants a government motion for a\nsubstantial assistance departure - treats relief from a statutory\nminimum as a quid pro quo when the government is satisfied with the\nassistance. The Ahlers would have us interpret the sentence as if\nit read: \"Upon motion of the government reflecting a defendant's\nsubstantial assistance . . . , the court shall have the authority\n\n                                       -13-\n\fThus,   the    statute   opens   the     door   for   a   departure     below   the\n\notherwise applicable mandatory minimum - but only those reasons\n\nrelated to the nature and extent of the defendant's substantial\nassistance can figure into the ensuing sentencing calculus.\n\n              The case law, for the most part, is fully in accord with\n\nthis construction.        See, e.g., United States v. Rabins, 63 F.3d\n\n721, 727 (8th Cir. 1995); United States v. Thomas, 11 F.3d 732,\n\n736-37 (7th Cir. 1993); United States v. Campbell, 995 F.2d 173,\n\n175 (10th Cir. 1993); United States v. Valente, 961 F.2d 133, 134-\n\n35 (9th Cir. 1992); United States v. Snelling, 961 F.2d 93, 97 (6th\n\nCir. 1991). The Ahlers dismiss these decisions out of hand, noting\n\nthat most of the courts in question have not been confronted with\n\nthe precise statutory construction argument that is proffered here.\nWe are convinced, however, that those courts have reached the\n\ncorrect conclusion and that the Ahlers' argument, though ingenious,\n\ndoes not call that conclusion into serious question.\n              The Ahlers counter-attack on four fronts.           First, citing\n\nUnited States v. Calle, 796 F. Supp. 853, 860-61 (D. Md. 1992),\n\nthey    insist   that    our   reading    of    section   3553(e)      drains   the\n\nstatute's second textual sentence of all meaning.                 To avoid that\n\nresult, they read that sentence to restore what they call the\n\ndistrict      court's    \"full   guideline      powers\"     and   to    authorize\n\n\n\n\nto impose a sentence below a level established by statute.\" This\nreading contradicts Congress's placement of the limiting phrase\njust discussed.\n\n                                       -14-\n\fdepartures based on any and all of the sentencing guidelines and\n\npolicy statements.\n\n            This construct overlooks the obvious: all federal courts\nare full guidelines courts by virtue of section 3553(b), and the\n\nsentencing     guidelines     fully    incorporate     statutorily   imposed\n\nmandatory minimum sentences through the mechanism of USSG §5G1.1.5\nThus, the determination of a guideline sentence occurs in a single\n\ncoherent process of which USSG §5G1.1 is a part.             Viewed in that\n\nlight, section 3553(e)'s second textual sentence restricts the\n\ncourt's reference to those guidelines and policy statements that\n\nbear directly upon the desirability and extent of a substantial\n\nassistance departure.        In our opinion, that is why Congress used\n\nthe adjective \"such\" to modify the subject (\"sentence\") of the\nsecond textual sentence.        That usage plainly refers back to the\n\npenal sentence mentioned in the previous text, that is, a sentence\n\nfashioned    \"so   as   to     reflect       the   defendant's   substantial\nassistance.\"    The Calle court's contrary reading of the statute is\n\nunconvincing.\n\n            Next, the Ahlers point out that some parts of section\n\n3553 refer to specific subsections of 28 U.S.C. § 994, whereas\n\n     5\n      This guideline \"describes how the statutorily authorized\nmaximum sentence, or a statutorily required minimum sentence, may\naffect the determination of a sentence under the guidelines.\" USSG\n§5G1.1, cmt. Pertinently, it provides that \"[w]here a statutorily\nrequired minimum sentence is greater than the maximum of the\napplicable guideline range, the statutorily required minimum\nsentence shall be the guideline sentence.\" Id. §5G1.1(b). When\nthe applicable GSR encompasses both a statutorily required minimum\nsentence and a statutory maximum, a court can impose any sentence\nbetween those two benchmarks. Id. §5G1.1(c).\n\n                                      -15-\n\fsection 3553(e) does not. From this circumstance, they reason that\n\nif Congress had intended the second sentence of section 3553(e) to\n\ndirect courts only to those guideline provisions pertaining to a\ndefendant's   substantial    assistance,   it   would   have    inserted   a\n\nspecific reference to 28 U.S.C. § 994(n) (the provision directing\n\nthe Sentencing Commission to promulgate guidelines and policy\nstatements pertaining to substantial assistance).             This argument\n\nreads too much into our interpretation of section 3553(e).\n\n          In Mariano, we explained that although a sentencing\n\ncourt's   assessment    of   the   substantiality   of    a     defendant's\n\nassistance should give special weight to the factors enumerated in\n\nUSSG §5K1.1,6 the \"list is representative rather than exclusive.\"\n\n983 F.2d at 1156.      Thus, while a sentencing court is not free to\n\"consider any datum it pleases\" when passing upon a motion for a\n\nsubstantial assistance departure, the court may consider mitigating\n\nfactors, whether or not specified in section 5K1.1, \"to the extent\nthat they can fairly be said to touch upon the degree, efficacy,\n\ntimeliness, and circumstances of a defendant's cooperation.\"            Id.\n\nCongress's decision not to cite to specific subsections of 28\n\nU.S.C. § 994 dovetails perfectly with this analysis:                 it is\n\n     6\n      Section 5K1.1 is a guideline provision that traces its roots\ndirectly to 28 U.S.C. § 994(n). See Mariano, 983 F.2d at 1154-55.\nThe factors that it enumerates are the court's evaluation of the\nsignificance and usefulness of the defendant's assistance (giving\nparticular deference to the government's evaluation of that\nassistance); the reliability of any information or testimony given\nby the defendant; the timeliness, nature, and extent of the\nassistance; and any danger to which the defendant or members of his\nfamily was exposed as a result of the assistance.              USSG\n§5K1.1(a)(1)-(5).\n\n                                   -16-\n\freasonable to assume, and adequately plausible for our purposes,\n\nthat   Congress    deliberately       refrained   from      citing    specific\n\nsubsections of 28 U.S.C. § 994 so as not to narrow this universe of\nmitigating factors. Put another way, once the government has moved\n\nfor a departure pursuant to section 3553(e), a sentencing court,\n\nfollowing Congress's direction, should review all the guidelines\nand policy statements promulgated by the Sentencing Commission\n\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 994 in order to determine an appropriate sentence\n\nthat reflects the nature and extent of the defendant's substantial\n\nassistance.\n\n           The Ahlers also suggest that allowing consideration of\n\nfactors   unrelated   to     substantial     assistance     will    heighten   a\n\ndefendant's incentive to cooperate with the authorities and thus\npromote the core purpose of section 3553(e).              This suggestion is\n\nmisdirected.      Congress's intent was not to create the widest\n\npossible incentives for cooperation, but, rather, to balance a\ndefendant's     incentives     with    the   benefits     accruing     to   the\n\ngovernment.     See Mariano, 983 F.2d at 1155.              To achieve this\n\nbalance, Congress chose to enact statutory minimum sentences and\n\nallow only one way out:      cooperation with law enforcement.          See 140\n\nCong. Rec. S12004 (daily ed. Aug. 18, 1994) (statement of Sen.\n\nHatch).       Reworking    this   balance     would   not    only    undermine\n\nlegislative intent but also threaten the integrity of the system of\n\nmandatory minimum sentencing so prized by Congress.\n\n           The Ahlers have a fallback position:               they strive to\n\nconvince us that the relevant statutory language, if not clearly\n\n                                      -17-\n\ffavorable to them, is at least ambiguous and thus subject to a\n\ngenerous construction under the rule of lenity.           We are not\n\npersuaded.\n          In a criminal case, the rule of lenity requires a court\n\nto resolve true statutory uncertainty in the accused's favor.\n\nBifulco v. United States, 447 U.S. 381, 387 (1980); United States\n\nv. Nippon Paper Indus. Co., 109 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1997).     But the\n\nsine qua non for the rule's application is genuine ambiguity, and\n\na statute is not ambiguous simply because litigants (or even an\n\noccasional court) question its interpretation.      Nippon Paper, 109\n\nF.3d at 8.     It is only when no reasonably clear meaning can be\n\ngleaned from the text of a statute, leaving courts to guess at what\n\nCongress intended, that the rule of lenity comes into play.      Id.\n\n          In this case, the statute at issue - 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e)\n\n- has a clear and plausible meaning.     There is no principled way in\n\nwhich it can be labeled ambiguous.         Consequently, the rule of\nlenity does not apply.\n\n             That ends the matter.   Our reading of section 3553(e) is\na commonsense interpretation that comports with the language,\n\nstructure, and evident purpose of the law.      It is consistent with\n\nthe conclusions of other appellate courts that have considered the\n\nissue, e.g., Rabins, 63 F.3d at 727; Campbell, 995 F.2d at 175, and\n\nnone of the Ahlers' objections cast doubt upon it.       We therefore\n\nhold that section 3553(e) authorizes a court, once the government\n\nmoves pursuant thereto, to sentence a defendant below a statutorily\n\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\fimposed minimum but only to an extent that reflects the court's\n\nassessment of the defendant's substantial assistance.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n            We need go no further. Even though we admire the Ahlers'\n\nrepentance and efforts at reform, we cannot reward that change of\n\ncourse in the way that the Ahlers suggest.   Because the court below\n\ncorrectly apprehended that it lacked legal authority to grant the\n\nAhlers' motions for additional downward departures, we affirm its\n\nsentencing determinations.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -19-\n\f",

The district court ruled that it lacked the authority, under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(e), to honor this request. Armed with nothing but the sharp point of statutory language, the Ahlers brothers present us with the direct question of whether a government motion for a downward departure to reflect a defendant's substantial assistance removes the constraint of a statutory minimum sentence and opens the door for consideration of departure grounds unrelated to substantial assistance. We hold that a substantial assistance motion does not have so liberating an effect. Accordingly, we affirm the district court's assessment of the limits that Congress placed upon its sentencing authority under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the 1990s, a drug kingpin, Robert Shimek, directed a large-scale illicit enterprise reaching from Canada to New Orleans. Typically, Shimek's henchmen would deposit illegal drugs&#8212;marijuana, ecstacy, hashish, LSD, and the like&#8212;at remote locations in Canada (usually near Vermont or Maine); runners would smuggle the contraband in backpacks across the border and return with the proceeds of previously consummated drug sales; their accomplices in the United States would repackage the drugs for distribution; and other participants would market them at music concerts and elsewhere.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For a period of roughly six months, the Ahlers brothers worked the channels of this underground empire, driving Shimek to various concerts, acting as couriers, and selling drugs. In October of 1997, their swift chariot spun off the fast track: a Florida state trooper apprehended them driving a vehicle that contained two large nitrous oxide tanks, sheets of LSD, marijuana, and sundry drug paraphernalia. They were found guilty of state drug-trafficking charges and sentenced to serve 60 days in jail (with additional time suspended). They maintain, with considerable support in the record, that upon their release they ended their intercourse with Shimek, kept to the straight and narrow, and pursued exemplary lifestyles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding this about-face, the past came back to haunt them. On June 21, 2000, a federal grand jury handed up a three-count indictment arising out of their participation in Shimek's network. Count 1 alleged that the brothers conspired to distribute, and to possess with intent to distribute, various controlled substances. Count 2 alleged that they conspired to import various controlled substances into the United States. Count 3 alleged that they possessed various controlled substances with intent to distribute. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)-(b), 846, 952(a)-(b), 960(a)-(b), 963. On February 7, 2001, both men pleaded guilty to count 1 of the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After tabulating all the drugs associated with the offense of conviction and converting them to their marijuana equivalent, <i>see</i> USSG &#167; 2D1.1, the probation department compiled a presentence investigation report (PSI Report) that attributed a total of 267 kilograms of marijuana equivalent to the defendants. Crediting each of them with a three-level downward dip for acceptance of responsibility, USSG &#167; 3E1.1, the PSI Report proposed an adjusted offense level of 23. This produced a guideline sentencing range (GSR) of 51-63 months for John Ahlers (who was ranked in criminal history category II) and 57-71 months for Peter Ahlers (who was ranked in criminal history category III). Finally, the PSI Report noted that, by statute, the offense of conviction called for a mandatory minimum sentence of 60 months. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the disposition hearing, the government asked the court to depart downward to reflect the Ahlers' substantial assistance in the investigation of others. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(e); USSG &#167; 5K1.1. At the same time, the Ahlers cross-moved for additional departures based on extraordinary presentence rehabilitation. <i>See United States v. Craven,</i> 239 F.3d 91, 99 (1st Cir.2001) (discussing such departures); <i>United States v. Sklar,</i> 920 F.2d 107, 115-17 (1st Cir.1990) (similar); <i>see generally</i> USSG &#167; 5K2.0. Pursuant to the plea agreement, the district court dismissed counts 2 and 3 of the indictment. It then granted each defendant a 21-month downward departure for substantial assistance, but stopped there. The court took the position that it did not have any authority to further depreciate the statutory minimum sentence based on a ground (like extraordinary presentence rehabilitation) unrelated to the defendants' substantial assistance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each defendant appeals from his 39-month incarcerative sentence, challenging the \"lack of authority\" holding. We consolidated the appeals for briefing and argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As said, the sole issue on appeal concerns the court's power to depart below the statutory minimum sentence on a ground unrelated to substantial assistance. Appellate jurisdiction from a denial of a departure request attaches when the sentencing court bases its action on a perception that it lacks the legal authority to grant the request. <i>See United States v. Pierro,</i> 32 F.3d 611, 619 (1st Cir.1994); <i>United States v. Mariano,</i> 983 F.2d 1150, 1153-54 (1st Cir.1993). Because the court below premised its refusal to depart on such a perceived lack of authority, we have jurisdiction to hear and determine these appeals. Moreover, the appeals hinge on a quintessentially legal judgment, thus engendering plenary review. <i>Mariano,</i> 983 F.2d at 1154.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether there is anything of substance to be decided is another matter. Citing <i>United States v. Chestna,</i> 962 F.2d 103 (1st Cir.1992) (per curiam), the government hypothesizes that the issue raised in these appeals is barred by the doctrine of <i>stare decisis.</i> We start by testing that hypothesis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Chestna,</i> the government moved pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(e) and USSG &#167; 5K1.1 for a downward departure reflecting the defendant's substantial assistance.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> 962 F.2d at 104. The defendant simultaneously moved for a downward departure based on her unique family responsibilities. <i>Id.</i> at 104-05. She contended that the government's motion for a substantial assistance departure opened the door for consideration of other factors in determining the degree of the departure. <i>Id.</i> at 105. We upheld the district court's rejection of her claim. <i>Id.</i> at 106 (stating that any additional factor not specifically listed in section 5K1.1 \"necessarily would relate to the substance of the initiating motion, i.e., a defendant's substantial assistance,\" in order to affect the extent of the departure).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to the government's importunings, our decision in <i>Chestna</i> does not conclusively refute the Ahlers' argument. In that case, the defendant posited that a sentencing court could take into account a factor unrelated to substantial assistance &#8212; family circumstances &#8212; when determining the extent of such a departure. The Ahlers, however, did not ask the lower court to consider an extraneous factor (in their case, rehabilitation) as a basis for enlarging a substantial assistance departure, but, rather, proffered that factor as a separate and distinct ground for departure. This is an issue that we did not reach in <i>Chestna. See id.</i> at 107. We reach it here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As framed, the Ahlers' argument relies on their interpretation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(e). That statute reads:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Limited authority to impose a sentence below a statutory minimum. &#8212; Upon motion from the Government, the court shall have the authority to impose a sentence below a level established by statute as minimum sentence so as to reflect a defendant's substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense. Such sentence shall be imposed in accordance with the guidelines and policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to section 994 of title 28, United States Code.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Ahlers asseverate that when a sentencing court grants a government motion for a substantial assistance departure, the first textual sentence of this provision renders nugatory any statutory minimum penal sentence, and that the second textual sentence restores the court's full powers under the sentencing guidelines to depart on other grounds (as if no mandatory minimum existed). In the Ahlers' view, this means that the granting of a government motion pursuant to section 3553(e) invariably authorizes the sentencing court to impose a sentence below an otherwise applicable statutory mandatory minimum based not merely on substantial assistance but also on any other ground recognized under the guidelines. Thus, their thesis runs, the sentencing court should have entertained departure requests based on extraordinary presentence rehabilitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The force of this argument depends on the meaning of the words that Congress wrote. To determine that meaning, we start with the language of the statute. <i>United States v.

Commonwealth of Mass.,</i> 61 F.3d 1003, 1007 (1st Cir.1995). We presume that Congress intended all words and provisions contained within a statute to have meaning and effect, and we will not readily adopt any construction that renders any such words or phrases meaningless, redundant, or superfluous. <i>Lopez-Soto v. Hawayek,</i> 175 F.3d 170, 173 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the foregoing, it is apparent that our move from the general to the specific necessitates establishing the context from which the particular statute speaks. <i>Riva,</i> 61 F.3d at 1007. Through the enactment of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553, Congress directed the federal courts as to how they should carry out their sentencing responsibilities in criminal cases. Subsections (a) through (d) establish the criteria and procedures to which a court must look in imposing sentence. Subsections (e) and (f) deal with a court's power to afford relief from statutorily imposed minimum sentences. Comparing the form and function of these latter two subsections should provide a panoramic view of the exceptions that Congress wished to create to the otherwise mandatory imposition of statutory minimum sentences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This approach requires that we compare the language of section 3553(e) (the provision at issue in this case) with the language of section 3553(f) (the only other proviso in section 3553 dealing with mandatory minimum sentences). Doing so, the conclusion is inescapable that the language Congress used in these two sections differs radically &#8212; and that difference hardly can be dismissed as a mere fortuity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f) &#8212; the so-called \"safety valve\" provision &#8212; reads as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Limitation on applicability of statutory minimums in certain cases.

Ortiz-Santiago,</i> 211 F.3d 146 (1st Cir. 2000), we elaborated on the form and function of this provision. We recognized that Congress enacted the safety valve to mitigate the harsh effects of mandatory minimum sentences on certain first-time offenders who played relatively minor roles in drug-trafficking schemes. <i>Id.</i> at 150.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The clear and precise language that Congress used to achieve this objective is striking. Congress unequivocally stated that as long as a certain set of conditions were met, courts should \"[dis]regard ... any statutory minimum sentence\" and sentence in accordance with the sentencing guidelines, \"[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law....\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f). Thus, section 3553(f) demonstrates Congress's ability to deploy unambiguous statutory language when it intends to authorize sentencing judges to ignore the limitations imposed by statutory minimum sentences and treat a \"mandatory minimum\" case like any other.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 3553(e) speaks in much more circumspect terms. The first textual sentence presumes the applicability of a statutorily established minimum penal sentence, ascribes the force of law to that sentence, and grants a sentencing court discretionary authority to impose a lesser sentence &#8212; but conditions that authority upon the filing of a government motion. Significantly, that textual sentence limits the authority to depart to the extent necessary \"so as to reflect a defendant's substantial assistance....\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(e). The second textual sentence of section 3553(e) &#8212; the sentence upon which the Ahlers chiefly rely &#8212; modifies its subject (\"sentence\") with the adjective \"such,\" thus referring back to the penal sentence contemplated in the first textual sentence. Unlike section 3553(f) &#8212; under which the mandatory minimum is to be <i>disregarded</i> once certain conditions are met&#8212;section 3553(e) retains the mandatory minimum as a reference point for a specific, carefully circumscribed type of departure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>See United States v. Aponte,</i> 36 F.3d 1050, 1051 (11th Cir.1994). The sharp divergence between these regimes leads inexorably to the conclusion that Congress had different plans in mind for the operation and effect of the two provisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Ahlers ignore this difference, modeling their rendition of section 3553(e) after the actual operation of section 3553(f). But they offer no explanation as to why two provisions with such different architecture and such different goals should be deemed to march in lockstep. It is accepted lore that when Congress uses certain words in one part of a statute, but omits them in another, an inquiring court should presume that this differential draftsmanship was deliberate. <i>Lopez-Soto,</i> 175 F.3d at 173. So it is here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that the unique language in which Congress couched section 3553(e) manifests an obvious purpose: once the government moves for a sentence below the statutory minimum pursuant to section 3553(e), the court has discretion to sentence below that minimum in a manner that reflects the nature and extent of the substantial assistance provided by the defendant &#8212; no more, no less. This construction is supported most clearly in the text by the placement of the limiting phrase \"so as to reflect a defendant's substantial assistance,\" which is attached to the main clause that grants the court its authority to impose a sentence below the statutory minimum. From this placement, the only logical conclusion is that the authority granted is limited thereby.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Thus, the statute opens the door for a departure below the otherwise applicable mandatory minimum &#8212; but only those reasons related to the nature and extent of the defendant's substantial assistance can figure into the ensuing sentencing calculus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case law, for the most part, is fully in accord with this construction. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Rabins,</i> 63 F.3d 721, 727 (8th Cir.1995); <i>United States v. Thomas,</i> 11 F.3d 732, 736-37 (7th Cir.1993); <i>United States v. Campbell,</i> 995 F.2d 173, 175 (10th Cir.1993); <i>United States v. Valente,</i> 961 F.2d 133, 134-35 (9th Cir.1992); <i>United States v. Snelling,</i> 961 F.2d 93, 97 (6th Cir.1991). The Ahlers dismiss these decisions out of hand, noting that most of the courts in question have not been confronted with the precise statutory construction argument that is proffered here. We are convinced, however, that those courts have reached the correct conclusion and that the Ahlers' argument, though ingenious, does not call that conclusion into serious question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Ahlers counter-attack on four fronts. First, citing <i>United States v. Calle,</i> 796 F.Supp. 853, 860-61 (D.Md. 1992), they insist that our reading of section 3553(e) drains the statute's second textual sentence of all meaning. To avoid that result, they read that sentence to restore what they call the district court's \"full guideline powers\" and to authorize departures based on any and all of the sentencing guidelines and policy statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This construct overlooks the obvious: all federal courts are full guidelines courts by virtue of section 3553(b), and the sentencing guidelines fully incorporate statutorily imposed mandatory minimum sentences through the mechanism of USSG &#167; 5G1.1.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Thus, the determination of a guideline sentence occurs in a single coherent process of which USSG &#167; 5G1.1 is a part. Viewed in that light, section 3553(e)'s second textual sentence restricts the court's reference to those guidelines and policy statements that bear directly upon the desirability and extent of a substantial assistance departure. In our opinion, that is why Congress used the adjective \"such\" to modify the subject (\"sentence\") of the second textual sentence. That usage plainly refers back to the penal sentence mentioned in the previous text, that is, a sentence fashioned \"so as to reflect the defendant's substantial assistance.\" The <i>Calle</i> court's contrary reading of the statute is unconvincing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, the Ahlers point out that some parts of section 3553 refer to specific subsections of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994, whereas section 3553(e) does not. From this circumstance, they reason that if Congress had intended the second sentence of section 3553(e) to direct courts only to those guideline provisions pertaining to a defendant's substantial assistance, it would have inserted a specific reference to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994(n) (the provision directing the Sentencing Commission to promulgate guidelines and policy statements pertaining to substantial assistance). This argument reads too much into our interpretation of section 3553(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Mariano,</i> we explained that although a sentencing court's assessment of the substantiality of a defendant's assistance should give special weight to the factors enumerated in USSG &#167; 5K1.1,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> the \"list is representative rather than exclusive.\" 983 F.2d at 1156. Thus, while a sentencing court is not free to \"consider any datum it pleases\" when passing upon a motion for a substantial assistance departure, the court may consider mitigating factors, whether or not specified in section 5K1.1, \"to the extent that they can fairly be said to touch upon the degree, efficacy, timeliness, and circumstances of a defendant's cooperation.\" <i>Id.</i> Congress's decision not to cite to specific subsections of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994 dovetails perfectly with this analysis: it is reasonable to assume, and adequately plausible for our purposes, that Congress deliberately refrained from citing specific subsections of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994 so as not to narrow this universe of mitigating factors. Put another way, once the government has moved for a departure pursuant to section 3553(e), a sentencing court, following Congress's direction, should review all the guidelines and policy statements promulgated by the Sentencing Commission under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994 in order to determine an appropriate sentence that reflects the nature and extent of the defendant's substantial assistance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Ahlers also suggest that allowing consideration of factors unrelated to substantial assistance will heighten a defendant's incentive to cooperate with the authorities and thus promote the core purpose of section 3553(e). This suggestion is misdirected. Congress's intent was not to create the widest possible incentives for cooperation, but, rather, to balance a defendant's incentives with the benefits accruing to the government. <i>See Mariano,</i> 983 F.2d at 1155. To achieve this balance, Congress chose to enact statutory minimum sentences and allow only one way out: cooperation with law enforcement. <i>See</i> 140 Cong. Rec. S12004 (daily ed. Aug. 18, 1994) (statement of Sen. Hatch). Reworking this balance would not only undermine legislative intent but also threaten the integrity of the system of mandatory minimum sentencing so prized by Congress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Ahlers have a fallback position: they strive to convince us that the relevant statutory language, if not clearly favorable to them, is at least ambiguous and thus subject to a generous construction under the rule of lenity. We are not persuaded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a criminal case, the rule of lenity requires a court to resolve true statutory uncertainty in the accused's favor. <i>Bifulco v. United States,</i> 447 U.S. 381, 387, 100 S.Ct. 2247, 65 L.Ed.2d 205 (1980); <i>United States v. Nippon Paper Indus. Co.,</i> 109 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.1997). But the sine qua non for the rule's application is genuine ambiguity, and a statute is not ambiguous simply because litigants (or even an occasional court) question its interpretation. <i>Nippon Paper,</i> 109 F.3d at 8. It is only when no reasonably clear meaning can be gleaned from the text of a statute, leaving courts to guess at what Congress intended, that the rule of lenity comes into play. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the statute at issue &#8212; 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(e) &#8212; has a clear and plausible meaning. There is no principled way in which it can be labeled ambiguous. Consequently, the rule of lenity does not apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends the matter. Our reading of section 3553(e) is a commonsense interpretation that comports with the language, structure, and evident purpose of the law. It is consistent with the conclusions of other appellate courts that have considered the issue, <i>e.g., Rabins,</i> 63 F.3d at 727; <i>Campbell,</i> 995 F.2d at 175, and none of the Ahlers' objections cast doubt upon it. We therefore hold that section 3553(e) authorizes a court, once the government moves pursuant thereto, to sentence a defendant below a statutorily imposed minimum but only to an extent that reflects the court's assessment of the defendant's substantial assistance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Even though we admire the Ahlers' repentance and efforts at reform, we cannot reward that change of course in the way that the Ahlers suggest. Because the court below correctly apprehended that it lacked legal authority to grant the Ahlers' motions for additional downward departures, we affirm its sentencing determinations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s-s_ref\">**</a>\n        <p> Of the Third Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(e), quoted<i>infra,</i> Congress ordained that a substantial assistance departure could trump a statutorily imposed mandatory minimum sentence.

After all, there is no statutory minimum applicable to a defendant who reaches the safe harbor of the safety valve provision<i>See Ortiz-Santiago,</i> 211 F.3d at 150. This demonstrates a fundamental difference between subsections (e) and (f): 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(e) recognizes and respects the sentence \"established by statute as [a] minimum sentence\" and does not explicitly confer upon sentencing courts a power to disregard it (instead granting limited authority to sentence below it). In marked contrast, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f) directs courts to sentence \"without regard to any statutory minimum sentence,\" thus completely removing the erstwhile mandatory minimum from the sentencing calculus.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The Ahlers' reading of this sentence &#8212; that it completely frees a court from the restraints of a statutory minimum penal sentence once the court grants a government motion for a substantial assistance departure &#8212; treats relief from a statutory minimum as a quid pro quo when the government is satisfied with the assistance. The Ahlers would have us interpret the sentence as if it read: \"Upon motion of the government reflecting a defendant's substantial assistance ..., the court shall have the authority to impose a sentence below a level established by statute.\" This reading contradicts Congress's placement of the limiting phrase just discussed</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> This guideline \"describes how the statutorily authorized maximum sentence, or a statutorily required minimum sentence, may affect the determination of a sentence under the guidelines.\" USSG &#167; 5G1.1, cmt.

The district court ruled that it lacked the authority, under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(e), to honor this request. Armed with nothing but the sharp point of statutory language, the Ahlers brothers present us with the direct question of whether a government motion for a downward departure to reflect a defendant's substantial assistance removes the constraint of a statutory minimum sentence and opens the door for consideration of departure grounds unrelated to substantial assistance. We hold that a substantial assistance motion does not have so liberating an effect. Accordingly, we affirm the district court's assessment of the limits that Congress placed upon its sentencing authority under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the 1990s, a drug kingpin, Robert Shimek, directed a large-scale illicit enterprise reaching from Canada to New Orleans. Typically, Shimek's henchmen would deposit illegal drugs&#8212;marijuana, ecstacy, hashish, LSD, and the like&#8212;at remote locations in Canada (usually near Vermont or Maine); runners would smuggle the contraband in backpacks across the border and return with the proceeds of previously consummated drug sales; their accomplices in the United States would repackage the drugs for distribution; and other participants would market them at music concerts and elsewhere.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For a period of roughly six months, the Ahlers brothers worked the channels of this underground empire, driving Shimek to various concerts, acting as couriers, and selling drugs. In October of 1997, their swift chariot spun off the fast track: a Florida state trooper apprehended them driving a vehicle that contained two large nitrous oxide tanks, sheets of LSD, marijuana, and sundry drug paraphernalia. They were found guilty of state drug-trafficking charges and sentenced to serve 60 days in jail (with additional time suspended). They maintain, with considerable support in the record, that upon their release they ended their intercourse with Shimek, kept to the straight and narrow, and pursued exemplary lifestyles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding this about-face, the past came back to haunt them. On June 21, 2000, a federal grand jury handed up a three-count indictment arising out of their participation in Shimek's network. Count 1 alleged that the brothers conspired to distribute, and to possess with intent to distribute, various controlled substances. Count 2 alleged that they conspired to import various controlled substances into the United States.

Crediting each of them with a three-level downward dip for acceptance of responsibility, USSG &#167; 3E1.1, the PSI Report proposed an adjusted offense level of 23. This produced a guideline sentencing range (GSR) of 51-63 months for John Ahlers (who was ranked in criminal history category II) and 57-71 months for Peter Ahlers (who was ranked in criminal history category III). Finally, the PSI Report noted that, by statute, the offense of conviction called for a mandatory minimum sentence of 60 months. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the disposition hearing, the government asked the court to depart downward to reflect the Ahlers' substantial assistance in the investigation of others. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(e); USSG &#167; 5K1.1.

Appellate jurisdiction from a denial of a departure request attaches when the sentencing court bases its action on a perception that it lacks the legal authority to grant the request. <i>See United States v.

Because the court below premised its refusal to depart on such a perceived lack of authority, we have jurisdiction to hear and determine these appeals. Moreover, the appeals hinge on a quintessentially legal judgment, thus engendering plenary review. <i>Mariano,</i> 983 F.2d at 1154.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether there is anything of substance to be decided is another matter.

The defendant simultaneously moved for a downward departure based on her unique family responsibilities. <i>Id.</i> at 104-05. She contended that the government's motion for a substantial assistance departure opened the door for consideration of other factors in determining the degree of the departure. <i>Id.</i> at 105. We upheld the district court's rejection of her claim. <i>Id.</i> at 106 (stating that any additional factor not specifically listed in section 5K1.1 \"necessarily would relate to the substance of the initiating motion, i.e., a defendant's substantial assistance,\" in order to affect the extent of the departure).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to the government's importunings, our decision in <i>Chestna</i> does not conclusively refute the Ahlers' argument. In that case, the defendant posited that a sentencing court could take into account a factor unrelated to substantial assistance &#8212; family circumstances &#8212; when determining the extent of such a departure. The Ahlers, however, did not ask the lower court to consider an extraneous factor (in their case, rehabilitation) as a basis for enlarging a substantial assistance departure, but, rather, proffered that factor as a separate and distinct ground for departure. This is an issue that we did not reach in <i>Chestna. See id.</i> at 107.

In the Ahlers' view, this means that the granting of a government motion pursuant to section 3553(e) invariably authorizes the sentencing court to impose a sentence below an otherwise applicable statutory mandatory minimum based not merely on substantial assistance but also on any other ground recognized under the guidelines. Thus, their thesis runs, the sentencing court should have entertained departure requests based on extraordinary presentence rehabilitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The force of this argument depends on the meaning of the words that Congress wrote.

We presume that Congress intended all words and provisions contained within a statute to have meaning and effect, and we will not readily adopt any construction that renders any such words or phrases meaningless, redundant, or superfluous. <i>Lopez-Soto v.

Through the enactment of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553, Congress directed the federal courts as to how they should carry out their sentencing responsibilities in criminal cases. Subsections (a) through (d) establish the criteria and procedures to which a court must look in imposing sentence. Subsections (e) and (f) deal with a court's power to afford relief from statutorily imposed minimum sentences. Comparing the form and function of these latter two subsections should provide a panoramic view of the exceptions that Congress wished to create to the otherwise mandatory imposition of statutory minimum sentences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This approach requires that we compare the language of section 3553(e) (the provision at issue in this case) with the language of section 3553(f) (the only other proviso in section 3553 dealing with mandatory minimum sentences). Doing so, the conclusion is inescapable that the language Congress used in these two sections differs radically &#8212; and that difference hardly can be dismissed as a mere fortuity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f) &#8212; the so-called \"safety valve\" provision &#8212; reads as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Limitation on applicability of statutory minimums in certain cases.

We recognized that Congress enacted the safety valve to mitigate the harsh effects of mandatory minimum sentences on certain first-time offenders who played relatively minor roles in drug-trafficking schemes. <i>Id.</i> at 150.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The clear and precise language that Congress used to achieve this objective is striking. Congress unequivocally stated that as long as a certain set of conditions were met, courts should \"[dis]regard ... any statutory minimum sentence\" and sentence in accordance with the sentencing guidelines, \"[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law....\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f). Thus, section 3553(f) demonstrates Congress's ability to deploy unambiguous statutory language when it intends to authorize sentencing judges to ignore the limitations imposed by statutory minimum sentences and treat a \"mandatory minimum\" case like any other.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 3553(e) speaks in much more circumspect terms. The first textual sentence presumes the applicability of a statutorily established minimum penal sentence, ascribes the force of law to that sentence, and grants a sentencing court discretionary authority to impose a lesser sentence &#8212; but conditions that authority upon the filing of a government motion. Significantly, that textual sentence limits the authority to depart to the extent necessary \"so as to reflect a defendant's substantial assistance....\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(e). The second textual sentence of section 3553(e) &#8212; the sentence upon which the Ahlers chiefly rely &#8212; modifies its subject (\"sentence\") with the adjective \"such,\" thus referring back to the penal sentence contemplated in the first textual sentence. Unlike section 3553(f) &#8212; under which the mandatory minimum is to be <i>disregarded</i> once certain conditions are met&#8212;section 3553(e) retains the mandatory minimum as a reference point for a specific, carefully circumscribed type of departure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>See United States v.

The sharp divergence between these regimes leads inexorably to the conclusion that Congress had different plans in mind for the operation and effect of the two provisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Ahlers ignore this difference, modeling their rendition of section 3553(e) after the actual operation of section 3553(f). But they offer no explanation as to why two provisions with such different architecture and such different goals should be deemed to march in lockstep. It is accepted lore that when Congress uses certain words in one part of a statute, but omits them in another, an inquiring court should presume that this differential draftsmanship was deliberate. <i>Lopez-Soto,</i> 175 F.3d at 173. So it is here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that the unique language in which Congress couched section 3553(e) manifests an obvious purpose: once the government moves for a sentence below the statutory minimum pursuant to section 3553(e), the court has discretion to sentence below that minimum in a manner that reflects the nature and extent of the substantial assistance provided by the defendant &#8212; no more, no less. This construction is supported most clearly in the text by the placement of the limiting phrase \"so as to reflect a defendant's substantial assistance,\" which is attached to the main clause that grants the court its authority to impose a sentence below the statutory minimum. From this placement, the only logical conclusion is that the authority granted is limited thereby.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Thus, the statute opens the door for a departure below the otherwise applicable mandatory minimum &#8212; but only those reasons related to the nature and extent of the defendant's substantial assistance can figure into the ensuing sentencing calculus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case law, for the most part, is fully in accord with this construction. <i>See, e.g., United States v.

The Ahlers dismiss these decisions out of hand, noting that most of the courts in question have not been confronted with the precise statutory construction argument that is proffered here. We are convinced, however, that those courts have reached the correct conclusion and that the Ahlers' argument, though ingenious, does not call that conclusion into serious question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Ahlers counter-attack on four fronts. First, citing <i>United States v. Calle,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1559351\"><a href=\"/opinion/1559351/united-states-v-calle/\"><span class=\"volume\">796</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">853</span></a></span>, 860-61 (D.Md. 1992), they insist that our reading of section 3553(e) drains the statute's second textual sentence of all meaning. To avoid that result, they read that sentence to restore what they call the district court's \"full guideline powers\" and to authorize departures based on any and all of the sentencing guidelines and policy statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This construct overlooks the obvious: all federal courts are full guidelines courts by virtue of section 3553(b), and the sentencing guidelines fully incorporate statutorily imposed mandatory minimum sentences through the mechanism of USSG &#167; 5G1.1.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Thus, the determination of a guideline sentence occurs in a single coherent process of which USSG &#167; 5G1.1 is a part. Viewed in that light, section 3553(e)'s second textual sentence restricts the court's reference to those guidelines and policy statements that bear directly upon the desirability and extent of a substantial assistance departure. In our opinion, that is why Congress used the adjective \"such\" to modify the subject (\"sentence\") of the second textual sentence. That usage plainly refers back to the penal sentence mentioned in the previous text, that is, a sentence fashioned \"so as to reflect the defendant's substantial assistance.\" The <i>Calle</i> court's contrary reading of the statute is unconvincing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, the Ahlers point out that some parts of section 3553 refer to specific subsections of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994, whereas section 3553(e) does not. From this circumstance, they reason that if Congress had intended the second sentence of section 3553(e) to direct courts only to those guideline provisions pertaining to a defendant's substantial assistance, it would have inserted a specific reference to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994(n) (the provision directing the Sentencing Commission to promulgate guidelines and policy statements pertaining to substantial assistance). This argument reads too much into our interpretation of section 3553(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Mariano,</i> we explained that although a sentencing court's assessment of the substantiality of a defendant's assistance should give special weight to the factors enumerated in USSG &#167; 5K1.1,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> the \"list is representative rather than exclusive.\" 983 F.2d at 1156. Thus, while a sentencing court is not free to \"consider any datum it pleases\" when passing upon a motion for a substantial assistance departure, the court may consider mitigating factors, whether or not specified in section 5K1.1, \"to the extent that they can fairly be said to touch upon the degree, efficacy, timeliness, and circumstances of a defendant's cooperation.\" <i>Id.</i> Congress's decision not to cite to specific subsections of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994 dovetails perfectly with this analysis: it is reasonable to assume, and adequately plausible for our purposes, that Congress deliberately refrained from citing specific subsections of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994 so as not to narrow this universe of mitigating factors. Put another way, once the government has moved for a departure pursuant to section 3553(e), a sentencing court, following Congress's direction, should review all the guidelines and policy statements promulgated by the Sentencing Commission under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994 in order to determine an appropriate sentence that reflects the nature and extent of the defendant's substantial assistance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Ahlers also suggest that allowing consideration of factors unrelated to substantial assistance will heighten a defendant's incentive to cooperate with the authorities and thus promote the core purpose of section 3553(e). This suggestion is misdirected. Congress's intent was not to create the widest possible incentives for cooperation, but, rather, to balance a defendant's incentives with the benefits accruing to the government. <i>See Mariano,</i> 983 F.2d at 1155. To achieve this balance, Congress chose to enact statutory minimum sentences and allow only one way out: cooperation with law enforcement. <i>See</i> 140 Cong. Rec. S12004 (daily ed. Aug. 18, 1994) (statement of Sen. Hatch). Reworking this balance would not only undermine legislative intent but also threaten the integrity of the system of mandatory minimum sentencing so prized by Congress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Ahlers have a fallback position: they strive to convince us that the relevant statutory language, if not clearly favorable to them, is at least ambiguous and thus subject to a generous construction under the rule of lenity.

United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110305\"><a href=\"/opinion/110305/bifulco-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">381</span></a></span>, 387, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110305\"><a href=\"/opinion/110305/bifulco-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

But the sine qua non for the rule's application is genuine ambiguity, and a statute is not ambiguous simply because litigants (or even an occasional court) question its interpretation. <i>Nippon Paper,</i> 109 F.3d at 8. It is only when no reasonably clear meaning can be gleaned from the text of a statute, leaving courts to guess at what Congress intended, that the rule of lenity comes into play. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the statute at issue &#8212; 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(e) &#8212; has a clear and plausible meaning. There is no principled way in which it can be labeled ambiguous. Consequently, the rule of lenity does not apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends the matter. Our reading of section 3553(e) is a commonsense interpretation that comports with the language, structure, and evident purpose of the law. It is consistent with the conclusions of other appellate courts that have considered the issue, <i>e.g., Rabins,</i> 63 F.3d at 727; <i>Campbell,</i> 995 F.2d at 175, and none of the Ahlers' objections cast doubt upon it. We therefore hold that section 3553(e) authorizes a court, once the government moves pursuant thereto, to sentence a defendant below a statutorily imposed minimum but only to an extent that reflects the court's assessment of the defendant's substantial assistance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Even though we admire the Ahlers' repentance and efforts at reform, we cannot reward that change of course in the way that the Ahlers suggest. Because the court below correctly apprehended that it lacked legal authority to grant the Ahlers' motions for additional downward departures, we affirm its sentencing determinations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s-s_ref\">**</a>\n        <p> Of the Third Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(e), quoted<i>infra,</i> Congress ordained that a substantial assistance departure could trump a statutorily imposed mandatory minimum sentence. USSG &#167; 5K1.1 is the principal guideline adopted by the Sentencing Commission to aid district courts in fashioning substantial assistance departures.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> It is undisputed that neither of the defendants in this case qualifies for the safety valve</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> In this sense, section 3553(e) provides the only authority for a court to sentence below a statutory minimum. After all, there is no statutory minimum applicable to a defendant who reaches the safe harbor of the safety valve provision<i>See Ortiz-Santiago,</i> 211 F.3d at 150. This demonstrates a fundamental difference between subsections (e) and (f): 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(e) recognizes and respects the sentence \"established by statute as [a] minimum sentence\" and does not explicitly confer upon sentencing courts a power to disregard it (instead granting limited authority to sentence below it). In marked contrast, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f) directs courts to sentence \"without regard to any statutory minimum sentence,\" thus completely removing the erstwhile mandatory minimum from the sentencing calculus.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The Ahlers' reading of this sentence &#8212; that it completely frees a court from the restraints of a statutory minimum penal sentence once the court grants a government motion for a substantial assistance departure &#8212; treats relief from a statutory minimum as a quid pro quo when the government is satisfied with the assistance. The Ahlers would have us interpret the sentence as if it read: \"Upon motion of the government reflecting a defendant's substantial assistance ..., the court shall have the authority to impose a sentence below a level established by statute.\" This reading contradicts Congress's placement of the limiting phrase just discussed</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> This guideline \"describes how the statutorily authorized maximum sentence, or a statutorily required minimum sentence, may affect the determination of a sentence under the guidelines.\" USSG &#167; 5G1.1, cmt. Pertinently, it provides that \"[w]here a statutorily required minimum sentence is greater than the maximum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily required minimum sentence shall be the guideline sentence.\"<i>Id.</i> &#167; 5G1.1(b). When the applicable GSR encompasses both a statutorily required minimum sentence and a statutory maximum, a court can impose any sentence between those two benchmarks. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 5G1.1(c).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Section 5K1.1 is a guideline provision that traces its roots directly to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994(n)<i>See Mariano,</i> 983 F.2d at 1154-55. The factors that it enumerates are the court's evaluation of the significance and usefulness of the defendant's assistance (giving particular deference to the government's evaluation of that assistance); the reliability of any information or testimony given by the defendant; the timeliness, nature, and extent of the assistance; and any danger to which the defendant or members of his family was exposed as a result of the assistance.
