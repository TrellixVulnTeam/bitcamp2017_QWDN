Holder, Jr. has been substituted for former Attorney General\nMichael B. Mukasey as the respondent.\n\f            PER CURIAM. Malik Zafar Mahmood, a native and citizen of\n\nPakistan, petitions for review of a decision of the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals (BIA) affirming an order of removal against\n\nhim.   Mahmood challenges the BIA's denial of his application for\n\nwithholding of removal, contending that (1) he has demonstrated\n\npast persecution, entitling him to a rebuttable presumption of\n\nfuture persecution, and (2) even if he has not established past\n\npersecution, he has established a clear probability of future\n\npersecution upon his return to Pakistan.    We deny the petition.\n\n                                 I.\n\n            Sometime in August 1999, Mahmood entered the United\n\nStates in Los Angeles, California, using a British passport that\n\nwas not in his name.    Over four years later, on January 29, 2004,\n\nfederal authorities initiated removal proceedings against him.\n\nMahmood conceded removability, but filed applications for asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, relief under the Convention Against Torture\n\n(CAT) and, in the alternative, voluntary departure.\n\n            At a May 17, 2006 hearing before an immigration judge\n\n(IJ), Mahmood testified that when living in his native Pakistan, he\n\nexperienced persecution as a member of the region's Shia Muslim\n\nminority.    In August 1998, while traveling to the mosque with a\n\ngroup of fellow Shias to observe a religious holiday in his home\n\nvillage, Mahmood was shot in the leg by members of the Sunni Muslim\n\nmajority.   After the shooting, he stayed in the hospital for three\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fto four months, during which time he and his mother received\n\nthreats that if he reported the shooting to the police, Sunnis\n\nwould attack his mother.    Mahmood did not report the shooting.\n\nAfter his release from the hospital, Mahmood stayed with his uncle\n\nin another region of Pakistan and with friends.    Mahmood did not\n\nreceive any threats during his stay with his uncle, although his\n\nmother continued to receive threats that Mahmood would be killed if\n\nhe returned to his home village.\n\n          Mahmood described several other incidents of harassment.\n\nHe testified that in 1992 or 1993, members of the Sunni Muslim\n\nmajority confiscated his father's family business, an ice factory.\n\nHe further testified that at various times, sometimes several times\n\nin a month, Sunni police came to his house to search for weapons\n\nbased on false reports by Sunni residents; however, the police\n\nnever arrested or detained Mahmood or charged him with a crime.   In\n\nhis application for asylum, Mahmood stated that one of his brothers\n\nhad been arrested and tortured by Sunni police, and left Pakistan\n\nbecause of this mistreatment.\n\n          Mahmood testified that at the time of the hearing before\n\nthe IJ, Mahmood's mother and two of his sisters, also Shia Muslims,\n\nstill lived in Pakistan.     A brother, also Shia, had lived in\n\nPakistan until shortly before the hearing. Mahmood did not present\n\nany documentary evidence in support of his applications, but\n\ninstead relied solely on his oral testimony.\n\n\n                                -3-\n\f           At the close of the hearing, the IJ issued an oral\n\ndecision denying Mahmood's applications for asylum, withholding of\n\nremoval,     CAT   protection   and,     in    the    alternative,       voluntary\n\ndeparture.     The IJ determined that the asylum claim was time-\n\nbarred, concluded that Mahmood had not proven entitlement to\n\nwithholding of removal or protection under the CAT, and denied\n\nvoluntary departure as a matter of discretion.                  On January 23,\n\n2008, the BIA affirmed the IJ's decision in a written opinion.\n\nThis timely petition for review followed.\n\n                                       II.\n\n           Mahmood     challenges      only     the     BIA's   denial     of   his\n\napplication    for   withholding    of       removal,    contending      that   the\n\nevidence establishes that he suffered past persecution and there is\n\na clear probability he would suffer future persecution upon his\n\nreturn to Pakistan.      Because Mahmood's petition does not assert\n\nchallenges to the BIA's disposition of his claims for asylum, CAT\n\nprotection, or voluntary departure, we do not address those claims.\n\n           We review the BIA's factual determinations under the\n\n\"substantial evidence\" standard.         Nikijuluw v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d\n\n115, 120 (1st Cir. 2005).          Under this deferential standard, we\n\naccept the BIA's findings if they are \"supported by reasonable,\n\nsubstantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a\n\nwhole.\"    Id. (quotation marks and citation omitted).                   The BIA's\n\nconclusion must stand unless \"any reasonable adjudicator would be\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fcompelled to conclude to the contrary.\" Boukhtouchen v. Gonzales,\n\n498 F.3d 78, 80 (1st Cir. 2007) (quotation marks and citation\n\nomitted). Where the BIA deferred to or adopted the IJ's reasoning,\n\nwe review those portions of the IJ's decision as part of the BIA's\n\nfinal decision. Hernandez-Barrera v. Ashcroft, 373 F.3d 9, 20 (1st\n\nCir. 2004).\n\n           To qualify for withholding of removal, an alien must\n\ndemonstrate that his \"life or freedom would be threatened in [the\n\nremoval]   country        because      of     the    alien's        race,     religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\nopinion.\" 8 U.S.C. ยง 1231(b)(3)(A).                   An alien is entitled to\n\nwithholding of removal if he shows \"a clear probability that, upon\n\nrepatriation, he will be persecuted on account of a protected\n\nground,\"   that     is,   that   he    will       \"more   likely     than     not\"   face\n\npersecution upon return to his homeland. Rotinsulu v. Mukasey, 515\n\nF.3d 68, 71 (1st Cir. 2008).               Alternatively, an alien may qualify\n\nfor withholding of removal based on a showing that he suffered past\n\npersecution    on    account     of    a     protected         ground,    triggering   a\n\nrebuttable presumption that the alien has a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture   persecution.        Id.      at    71-72.        In    order    to   amount   to\n\npersecution,      mistreatment        \"must        rise    above        unpleasantness,\n\nharassment, and even basic suffering.\"                    Nelson v. INS, 232 F.3d\n\n258, 263 (1st Cir. 2000). Furthermore, persecution \"always implies\n\nsome connection to government action or inaction,\" Nikijuluw, 427\n\n\n                                            -5-\n\fF.3d at 120-121 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted);\n\npersecution must be \"the direct result of government action,\n\ngovernment-supported          action,      or     government's     unwillingness      or\n\ninability to control private conduct.\"                 Id. at 121.\n\n           Substantial evidence supports the BIA's conclusion that\n\nMahmood    did    not       satisfy       his     burden    of   establishing     past\n\npersecution.           As   to     the    1998    shooting,      Mahmood    failed    to\n\ndemonstrate      the    requisite        connection    to    government     action    or\n\ninaction. Mahmood did not show that the police or other government\n\nauthorities supported his attackers, and, because he did not report\n\nthe 1998 shooting to the police, he cannot show that the police\n\nwere unable or unwilling to control his attackers.                         See Raza v.\n\nGonzales, 484 F.3d 125, 129 (1st Cir. 2007).                     Mahmood's remaining\n\nclaims of harassment, including the confiscation of his father's\n\nice factory in the early 1990s, threats made to himself and his\n\nmother, and police searches of his home based on false reports that\n\nhe possessed weapons, do not compel a finding of past persecution.\n\nBecause Mahmood failed to establish past persecution, he is not\n\nentitled to a rebuttable presumption of future persecution.\n\n           Substantial           evidence        likewise     supports     the    BIA's\n\ndetermination that Mahmood did not establish a clear probability of\n\nfuture persecution.          Mahmood's general descriptions of sectarian\n\ndisputes    between         Shia    and     Sunni     Muslims     in   Pakistan      are\n\ninsufficient to establish a likelihood of future persecution.                        See\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\fid. (holding that evidence of sporadic Sunni-Shiite violence in\n\nPakistan did not compel finding that petitioner would likely face\n\npersecution   upon   removal).   Moreover,   Mahmood's   mother,   two\n\nsisters, and, until shortly before the hearing, his brother, all of\n\nwhom are Shia Muslims, continued to live in Pakistan undisturbed.\n\nThese facts undermine Mahmood's claim that he would more likely\n\nthan not face persecution upon his return.1    See Aguilar-Solis v.\n\nINS, 168 F.3d 565, 573 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"Without some explanation,\n\nthe fact that close relatives continue to live peacefully in the\n\nalien's homeland undercuts the alien's claim that persecution\n\nawaits his return.\").\n\n          The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Mahmood testified that women are not targeted for sectarian\nviolence in Pakistan.     Nevertheless, the fact that Mahmood's\nbrother continued to live peacefully in Pakistan suggests that\nMahmood could do the same.\n\n                                 -7-\n\f",

As   to     the    1998    shooting,      Mahmood    failed    to\n\ndemonstrate      the    requisite        connection    to    government     action    or\n\ninaction. Mahmood did not show that the police or other government\n\nauthorities supported his attackers, and, because he did not report\n\nthe 1998 shooting to the police, he cannot show that the police\n\nwere unable or unwilling to control his attackers.

Mahmood's remaining\n\nclaims of harassment, including the confiscation of his father's\n\nice factory in the early 1990s, threats made to himself and his\n\nmother, and police searches of his home based on false reports that\n\nhe possessed weapons, do not compel a finding of past persecution.\n\nBecause Mahmood failed to establish past persecution, he is not\n\nentitled to a rebuttable presumption of future persecution.\n\n           Substantial           evidence        likewise     supports     the    BIA's\n\ndetermination that Mahmood did not establish a clear probability of\n\nfuture persecution.          Mahmood's general descriptions of sectarian\n\ndisputes    between         Shia    and     Sunni     Muslims     in   Pakistan      are\n\ninsufficient to establish a likelihood of future persecution.                        See\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\fid. (holding that evidence of sporadic Sunni-Shiite violence in\n\nPakistan did not compel finding that petitioner would likely face\n\npersecution   upon   removal).   Moreover,   Mahmood's   mother,   two\n\nsisters, and, until shortly before the hearing, his brother, all of\n\nwhom are Shia Muslims, continued to live in Pakistan undisturbed.\n\nThese facts undermine Mahmood's claim that he would more likely\n\nthan not face persecution upon his return.1    See Aguilar-Solis v.\n\nINS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198342\"><a href=\"/opinion/198342/aguilar-solis-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 573 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"Without some explanation,\n\nthe fact that close relatives continue to live peacefully in the\n\nalien's homeland undercuts the alien's claim that persecution\n\nawaits his return.\").\n\n          The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Mahmood testified that women are not targeted for sectarian\nviolence in Pakistan.
