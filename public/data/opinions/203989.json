Michael A. Ponsor, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                 Boudin, Selya and Dyk,* Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Tani E.

This appeal involves two claims of\n\ninstructional error and a belated claim of error concerning the\n\nprocedure to be followed by a trial court under the 2003 amendments\n\nto Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 51.          Concluding, as we do, that\n\nno substantive or procedural error tainted the challenged jury\n\ninstructions, we affirm.\n\nI.    BACKGROUND\n\n            We rehearse here only those facts necessary to place this\n\nappeal in context.\n\n            Plaintiff-appellant Emilio DeCaro worked for defendant-\n\nappellee Hasbro, Inc., at its plant in Longmeadow, Massachusetts,\n\nfor over two decades, most recently as a \"first pressman.\"          In that\n\ncapacity, the plaintiff operated large-scale printing presses used\n\nto embellish thousands of sheets of cardboard and paper hourly.\n\n            In 2001, the plaintiff informed Hasbro that his doctors\n\nhad    diagnosed    him   as     afflicted     with   multiple   sclerosis.\n\nNotwithstanding this diagnosis, he valiantly continued to work. By\n\n2005, however, his condition had deteriorated and he began a\n\nregimen of chemotherapy.       He left work and, in July of that year,\n\napplied for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits.\n\n            The    plaintiff's     SSDI      application   has   particular\n\npertinence here.      In it, he made a series of factual averments\n\ntouching upon his physical condition, some in his own hand and\n\nothers in the form of answers provided orally to a government\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fscrivener who typed his responses into the application.                 These\n\naverments (the accuracy of which was disputed at trial) included\n\nclaims that the plaintiff was unable to work and descriptions of\n\nhis particular physical impairments.\n\n               The plaintiff attempted to return to work on November 29,\n\n2005.     A company nurse dashed his hopes; after observing the\n\nplaintiff's physical appearance, she forbade him from resuming his\n\nposition without a doctor's note.          On November 30, the plaintiff's\n\nphysician wrote a letter opining that the plaintiff should eschew\n\nemployment until the following February.\n\n               On February 2, 2006, the plaintiff again tried to reclaim\n\nhis     job.       The   company   demurred,    citing     the   lack   of   a\n\ncontemporaneous medical clearance.             This sort of pas de deux\n\noccurred at least twice more during the next four months; the short\n\nof it is that Hasbro did not allow the plaintiff to return to work.\n\n               Disappointed by Hasbro's unwillingness to restore him to\n\nits work force, the plaintiff brought suit against the company in\n\na Massachusetts state court.        In his complaint, filed on June 9,\n\n2006, he asserted a gallimaufry of discrimination and breach of\n\ncontract claims, all arising under state law.            This asseverational\n\narray included claimed violations of Massachusetts's principal\n\nanti-discrimination statute (Massachusetts General Laws ch. 151B).\n\n               Hasbro removed the case to the United States District\n\nCourt for the District of Massachusetts on the basis of diversity\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fof citizenship and the existence of a controversy in the requisite\n\namount.   See 28 U.S.C. §§ 1332(a)(1), 1441.       Following a period of\n\npretrial discovery, the district court granted summary judgment in\n\nHasbro's favor on the breach of contract claim.1       An eight-day jury\n\ntrial ensued on the state-law discrimination claims.\n\n            As the trial wound down, the district court convened a\n\ncharge conference, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 51(b), to discuss how the\n\njury was to be instructed.      A court reporter attended the charge\n\nconference and memorialized what transpired.         The court commented\n\nupon the parties' proposed instructions and indicated generally\n\nwhich instructions it would give and which it would eschew.\n\n            Among   other   things,    Hasbro   proposed   an   instruction\n\nconcerning both the effect of the statements contained in the\n\nplaintiff's application for SSDI benefits and his receipt of those\n\nbenefits.    Its proposed instruction read in relevant part:\n\n            On his application for those benefits Mr.\n            DeCaro represented that he was disabled and\n            unable to work. Mr. DeCaro is bound by his\n            statements on his application for disability\n            and you must presume the truth.\n\nThe court noted that it would give an SSDI instruction, but not one\n\nthat was stated \"with as much intensity\" as Hasbro's suggested\n\ninstruction.    Instead, the court planned to \"say that the jury is\n\nentitled to take into consideration the statements made by Mr.\n\n\n\n     1\n      That ruling is not challenged on appeal and, thus, we do not\ndwell on it.\n\n                                      -4-\n\fDeCaro in his application for [SSDI] benefits\" and may find that\n\nthose statements \"are evidence that in fact he viewed himself as\n\nunable to perform the essential functions of his job.\"\n\n            Switching to a different subject, the plaintiff noted\n\nconflicting characterizations of the evidence about what Hasbro\n\nknew anent his disability and whether and when he had requested\n\nsome sort of accommodation to permit him to work notwithstanding\n\nthat disability.       Accordingly, he proposed an instruction relating\n\nto   an   employer's    duty   under   Massachusetts   law   to   provide   a\n\nreasonable accommodation, even in the absence of any request that\n\nit do so.   The court stated that it had read the relevant case law,\n\nsee, e.g., Leach v. Comm'r of Mass. Rehab. Comm'n, 827 N.E.2d 745,\n\n749 (Mass. App. Ct. 2005), and had concluded that Massachusetts law\n\ndoes not impose such an affirmative duty on the employer in the\n\ncircumstances at hand.\n\n            The attorneys for the parties delivered their summations\n\nthe next day.    Immediately thereafter, the court charged the jury\n\nand simultaneously gave a written copy of the charge to each party.\n\n            With respect to the receipt of SSDI benefits and the\n\nstatements made in the plaintiff's application for those benefits,\n\nthe court instructed:\n\n                   Defendant has pointed to the fact that,\n            while plaintiff was out on voluntary medical\n            leave, plaintiff applied for, and has been\n            continuously   receiving,   social    security\n            disability benefits since November 2005.\n            Plaintiff's application for those benefits\n\n                                       -5-\n\fincluded representations about the physical\nrequirements of the first pressman position\nand statements about his physical limitations\nat the time of his application.\n\n       You should examine the statements made\nby plaintiff in the application for social\nsecurity disability benefits and consider\nwhether these statements constitute admissions\nby him that he was in fact unable to perform\nthe essential functions of his job, with or\nwithout a reasonable accommodation, at the\ntime   he  completed   his   social   security\ndisability application.    A plaintiff is not\npermitted to say one thing in applying for\ndisability   benefits   and   another   thing,\nentirely the opposite, in seeking damages for\ndiscrimination.\n\n       In making this examination you should\nconsider all the facts and circumstances\nsurrounding the submission of the application.\nTo the extent that you find that statements\nmade in plaintiff's application for social\nsecurity disability benefits were made by\nplaintiff, you may decide that they reflected\nthe truth when made, and you may consider them\nas evidence related to Mr. DeCaro's ability to\nperform the essential functions of the first\npressman    position,    with    or    without\naccommodation, on the dates he attempted to\nreturn to work.\n\n        At the same time, keep in mind that the\nstandard for determining eligibility for\nsocial    security   disability   benefits   is\ndifferent from the standard you must apply in\ndetermining whether plaintiff was able, with\nor   without   reasonable   accommodation,   to\nperform the essential functions of his job.\nThe fact that Mr. DeCaro received social\nsecurity disability benefits is not in itself\nnecessarily fatal to a claim that he was able\nto perform the essential functions of his job.\nHowever, the receipt of benefits and the\nstatements made by plaintiff in applying for\nthem are items of evidence you may consider in\nmaking this determination.\n\n                     -6-\n\f          With     respect   to   the    initiation   of   a       reasonable\n\naccommodation, the court instructed:\n\n                 When a plaintiff in a disability\n          discrimination case contends that he was\n          entitled to a reasonable accommodation in\n          order to perform the essential functions of\n          his job, he must present evidence to persuade\n          the jury that he actually initiated a request\n          for the accommodation and engaged in an\n          interactive process with the employer to work\n          out the possible accommodation.    As part of\n          this process the employer may request medical\n          records and make inquires of the employee\n          about his medical condition. If you find on\n          the facts of this case that plaintiff never\n          requested a specific accommodation, then you\n          cannot    find   that    defendant   violated\n          plaintiff's rights by failing to offer him\n          one.\n\n          After completing its charge but before allowing the jury\n\nto retire, the court brought counsel to sidebar.           There — out of\n\nthe jury's earshot — it inquired about objections.             See Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 51(b)(2).     The plaintiff's attorney objected to the SSDI\n\ninstruction on two grounds, asserting that the instruction (i)\n\n\"simply overstates the law in Massachusetts\" and (ii) should have\n\ntold the jurors that the receipt of SSDI benefits was \"not fatal at\n\nall\" to the claims being tried.         The lawyer also objected to the\n\naccommodation instruction insofar as it obligated the plaintiff, as\n\na   condition    precedent   to   recovery,   to   request     a     specific\n\naccommodation.    The district court overruled these objections and\n\nsent the jury to the jury room to deliberate.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\f            To assist the jurors in their task, the court gave them\n\na written copy of its charge.          It also prepared a special verdict\n\nform.   See Fed. R. Civ. P. 49(a).           The form, a replica of which is\n\nattached    hereto    as   Appendix    A,    posed   a   series   of    questions.\n\nNeither party interposed any objection to either the use or the\n\nwording of the special verdict form.            The parties thus waived the\n\nright to object to these matters on appeal.              See Clausen v. Sea-3,\n\nInc., 21 F.3d 1181, 1196 (1st Cir. 1994); La Amiga del Pueblo, Inc.\n\nv. Robles, 937 F.2d 689, 692 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n            In due course, the jury concluded its deliberations. The\n\nfirst question on the special verdict form has four sub-parts, and\n\nthe jurors answered all four sub-parts in the negative.                     These\n\nanswers    memorialized     their     conclusion     that,   on   the    dates   in\n\nquestion, the plaintiff was not qualified to perform the essential\n\nfunctions    of   the   first   pressman      position    with    or   without   an\n\naccommodation.       Because those answers were dispositive, the jury —\n\nin accordance with directions contained in the special verdict form\n\n— found in favor of Hasbro and refrained from answering any other\n\nquestions set out in the form.\n\n            This timely appeal ensued. We have jurisdiction under 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1291.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fII.   ANALYSIS\n\n            We divide our analysis into two segments.                  The first\n\ndeals with the objections made at sidebar.               The second deals with\n\na newly emergent claim of procedural error.\n\n                           A.    The Sidebar Objections.\n\n            The plaintiff's briefs assign error to the overruling of\n\nhis objections to the SSDI and accommodation instructions.                    The\n\ndefendant counters, as a threshold matter, that the plaintiff's\n\nclaims of instructional error have been waived.                In its view, the\n\nplaintiff failed to comply at sidebar with either Rule 51(c)(1),\n\nwhich requires that an objection \"stat[e] distinctly the matter\n\nobjected    to   and       the    grounds   for   the    objection,\"    or    Rule\n\n51(d)(1)(B), which requires that an objection to a failure to\n\ninstruct be accompanied by a statement of the desired instruction.\n\n            The strictures of Rule 51 are not to be taken lightly.\n\nBaron v. Suffolk County Sheriff's Dep't, 402 F.3d 225, 235 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).      Accordingly, there is a high price to be paid for\n\nnoncompliance.         A    substantial     failure     to   comply   with   those\n\nrequirements normally results in forfeiture of the objection to\n\nwhich the failure relates.            Surprenant v. Rivas, 424 F.3d 5, 15\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).       Forfeited objections are reviewed only for plain\n\nerror.     Toscano v. Chandris, S.A., 934 F.2d 383, 385 (1st Cir.\n\n1991); Fed. R. Civ. P. 51(d)(2).\n\n\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\f           We begin with the plaintiff's objections to the SSDI\n\ninstruction.         The objections, quoted above, are not models of\n\nclarity and, although such objections have to be evaluated in light\n\nof the colloquy that transpired at the charge conference the day\n\nbefore, see Gray v. Genlyte Group, Inc., 289 F.3d 128, 133-34 & n.1\n\n(1st Cir. 2002); Wilson v. Mar. Overseas Corp., 150 F.3d 1, 7 (1st\n\nCir. 1998), saying that something \"simply overstates the law\" or\n\nthat the jury should be admonished that receipt of SSDI benefits is\n\n\"not   fatal    at     all\"   does   not    go   very   far    toward      preserving\n\nparticular legal points. This is especially so where, as here, the\n\njudge did not say that receipt of the SSDI benefits was fatal.                     The\n\npurpose of a sidebar objection is to inform the judge exactly what\n\nhe got wrong and what he should do to remedy the incipient harm.\n\n           In this case, the problem is compounded.                  The plaintiff\n\noffers an array of grounds on appeal, and the extent to which each\n\nground might have been apparent from the pretrial discussion\n\nvaries.\n\n           In    the    end,    however,     the   degree     to   which    the   SSDI\n\nobjections are or are not preserved does not alter the outcome of\n\nthe appeal.     Consequently, we will assume for argument's sake that\n\nthe objections to the SSDI instruction were preserved.\n\n           No such reservation is required for the plaintiff's\n\nasseveration that the jury should have been instructed on an\n\nemployer's      duty    to     initiate     consideration      of    a     reasonable\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\faccommodation.     That objection presented a fairly clear choice\n\nbetween giving such an instruction or withholding it, and the\n\nobjection echoed an instruction proposed by plaintiff's counsel and\n\ndiscussed in some detail at the charge conference.                 That the\n\nobjection    itself   was    terse    did   not,   in   the    idiosyncratic\n\ncircumstances of this case, deprive it of force.              After all, the\n\nroot purpose of Rule 51 is to ensure that the district court is\n\ngiven actual notice of the nature and grounds of a party's claim\n\nthat the court's instructions are deficient; style points are not\n\nawarded for the form of an objection.         See Wilson, 150 F.3d at 7.\n\n            We turn, then, to the merits of the objections, starting\n\nwith a few words about the standard of review.\n\n            Preserved claims of instructional error are reviewed\n\nunder a split standard.      We review de novo questions as to whether\n\njury instructions capture the essence of the applicable law, while\n\nreviewing for abuse of discretion questions as to whether the\n\ncourt's choice of phraseology in crafting its jury instructions is\n\nunfairly prejudicial.       See United States v. Nascimento, 491 F.3d\n\n25, 33-34 (1st Cir. 2007); Elliott v. S.D. Warren Co., 134 F.3d 1,\n\n7 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n            1.   The SSDI Instruction.      The plaintiff challenges the\n\nSSDI instruction as inconsistent with the Supreme Court's decision\n\nin Cleveland v. Policy Management Systems Corp., 526 U.S. 795\n\n\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\f(1999).2   He argues that the effect of the instruction was to\n\nestablish a forbidden presumption that the receipt of SSDI benefits\n\nprecludes a finding that an employee is able to perform the\n\nessential functions of his job, with or without an accommodation.\n\n           In order to put this claim of error into perspective, it\n\nis useful to step back and examine Cleveland.          There, a district\n\ncourt granted summary judgment in favor of an employer in a suit\n\nbrought under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 12101 et seq.     The district court reasoned that the plaintiff's\n\napplication for and receipt of SSDI benefits estopped her as a\n\nmatter of law from claiming that she was capable of performing the\n\nessential functions of her job.          The Fifth Circuit affirmed but\n\nsoftened the reasoning; it held that the receipt of SSDI benefits\n\ncreates a rebuttable presumption that the employee cannot perform\n\nthe essential functions of her job. Cleveland v. Policy Mgmt. Sys.\n\nCorp., 120 F.3d 513, 518 (5th Cir. 1997).         Because the plaintiff\n\nhad   failed   to   proffer   evidence    sufficient   to   overcome   that\n\npresumption, her appeal failed.      Id.\n\n           The Supreme Court saw the matter differently.                The\n\nJustices reversed, finding the SSDI scheme and the ADA scheme\n\nseparate and distinct.    526 U.S. at 801-05.     Consequently, receipt\n\nof benefits under the former scheme does not create any presumption\n\n\n      2\n      The reasoning of the Cleveland Court has been adopted by the\nSupreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. See Russell v. Cooley\nDickinson Hosp., Inc., 772 N.E.2d 1054, 1062 (Mass. 2002).\n\n                                  -12-\n\f(conclusive or rebuttable) with respect to a parallel ADA claim.\n\nId. at 805.    Withal, the Court was careful to note that an employee\n\nmay not simply ignore seeming contradictions between statements\n\nmade in an application for SSDI benefits and elements of an ADA\n\nclaim.   Id. at 807.         Rather, the employee must explain such seeming\n\ncontradictions.        Id.\n\n             Seen in this light, we believe that the district court's\n\nSSDI instruction comports with the thrust of the Cleveland Court's\n\nholding.     Pertinently, the court told the jury that the mere \"fact\n\nthat   Mr.    DeCaro    received     [SSDI]   benefits   is   not   in   itself\n\nnecessarily fatal to his claim.\"           The court further told the jury\n\nto \"consider\" whether the statements made by the plaintiff in\n\napplying for SSDI benefits constituted \"admissions\" as to his\n\ninability to perform the essential functions of his job.                    In\n\nresolving that point, the jurors were urged to \"consider all the\n\nfacts and circumstances.\"           Finally, the court warned the jury to\n\n\"keep in mind that the standard for determining eligibility for\n\n[SSDI] benefits is different from the standard you must apply in\n\ndetermining whether plaintiff was able, with or without reasonable\n\naccommodation, to perform the essential functions of his job.\"\n\nThese are correct statements of the law, consistent both with\n\nCleveland and with Massachusetts law.              See Russell v. Cooley\n\nDickinson Hosp., Inc., 772 N.E.2d 1054, 1062 (Mass. 2002).\n\n\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\f                Relatedly, the plaintiff argues that the court erred in\n\nfailing either to use the phrase \"not fatal at all\" or to emphasize\n\nthat       a   change   in   conditions    from   one    date   to   another   could\n\nconstitute         an    acceptable       means   of     harmonizing     seemingly\n\ncontradictory statements.             The first of these points is flatly\n\nincorrect: instructing the jury that the plaintiff's statements and\n\nthe consequent receipt of benefits were \"not fatal at all\" would\n\nhave usurped the jury's province.3                The point of the Cleveland\n\ndecision is that such statements may or may not be inimical to an\n\nemployment         discrimination      claim.           Everything     depends   on\n\ninterpretation: how the jurors view the statements and the receipt\n\nof benefits in the context of the overall situation.\n\n                The second part of this objection deals with matters of\n\nemphasis and choice of phraseology.                 While it might have been\n\nappropriate for the district court to make an express reference to\n\nthe effect of a \"change in conditions,\" that reference was not\n\nrequired.         In instructing a jury, a trial court is not obliged\n\neither to embellish legally correct statements or to cover every\n\nfactual permutation.4          Febres v. Challenger Carib. Corp., 214 F.3d\n\n\n       3\n       While the court's use of the phrase \"not in itself\nnecessarily fatal\" may have been an awkward locution, that wording\nis reminiscent of similar language in both Cleveland, 526 U.S. at\n797 (using the phrase \"does not necessarily estop\"), and Russell,\n772 N.E.2d at 1062 (similar).\n       4\n       Let us be perfectly clear: we do not suggest that the\ninstruction given by the district court would necessarily be\nsufficient in all circumstances. Consequently, we do not foreclose\n\n                                          -14-\n\f57, 62-63 (1st Cir. 2000); see United States v. DeStefano, 59 F.3d\n\n1, 2-3 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n             By the same token, we believe that the court's admonition\n\nthat \"[a] plaintiff is not permitted to say one thing in applying\n\nfor disability benefits and another thing, entirely the opposite,\n\nin seeking damages for discrimination,\" was within the realm of its\n\ndiscretion.     That admonition leaves ample room for an explanation\n\nas to why two seemingly contradictory statements are not in fact\n\ninconsistent.\n\n             The plaintiff makes a last-ditch argument to the SSDI\n\ninstruction.    Citing Rosebud Sioux Tribe v. A & P Steel, Inc., 733\n\nF.2d 509 (8th Cir. 1984), he suggests that a party can successfully\n\nappeal   a   legally   correct   jury   instruction   that   places   undue\n\nemphasis on an aspect of the law that favors the other party.           See\n\nid. at 519.    In the abstract, that may well be a correct statement\n\nof a legal principle — but the principle has no application here.\n\n             A trial judge has broad discretion in deciding how best\n\nto communicate complicated legal rules to a lay jury.          See, e.g.,\n\nFebres, 214 F.3d at 62-63.       That discretion was not exceeded — or\n\neven severely tested — in this case.        Both the length of the SSDI\n\ninstruction and its points of emphasis were warranted by the\n\nsubtlety of the issue.\n\n\nthe possibility that, in a future case, a different or more\ndetailed instruction might be required, depending on the facts and\nthe issues.\n\n                                   -15-\n\f          To     say    more   about    the     SSDI     instruction      would    be\n\nsupererogatory.        That instruction is legally correct and, in the\n\nfinal analysis, its phrasing is within the encincture of the\n\ndistrict court's discretion. See United States v. McGill, 953 F.2d\n\n10, 12 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"So long as the charge sufficiently conveys\n\nthe [party's] theory, it need not parrot the exact language that\n\nthe [party] prefers.\").\n\n          2. The Accommodation Instruction. The plaintiff's other\n\nclaim of instructional error need not detain us.                 He complains of\n\nthe jury instructions regarding an employer's duty to offer a\n\nreasonable    accommodation     to     an     employee    who    suffers    from    a\n\ndisability.       Specifically,        he     asserts    that,    under     certain\n\ncircumstances, an employer may be obliged to initiate a discussion\n\nabout the feasability of such an accommodation.                   See Leach, 827\n\nN.E.2d at 749.    This case, he says, called for such an instruction.\n\n          This claim of error is moot. Under the circumstances, an\n\nemployer's duty to accommodate does not arise unless (at a bare\n\nminimum) the employee is able to perform the essential functions of\n\nhis job with an accommodation.         See Cleveland, 526 U.S. at 805-06;\n\nRussell, 772 N.E.2d at 1062.\n\n          Here, the jury ended its deliberations once it determined\n\nthat the plaintiff was not able to perform the essential functions\n\nof the first pressman position, with or without an accommodation,\n\non any of the four dates in question.              See App'x A.      The special\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\fverdict form directed the jurors that \"[i]f you have answered 'No'\n\nas to all four dates, stop. . . .               You will have completed your\n\ndeliberations.\"         Id.     That became the law of the case.         See\n\nClausen, 21 F.3d at 1196.            Therefore, the jury never had occasion\n\nto reach the logically subsequent question of the employer's duty\n\nto accommodate. It follows inexorably that any error regarding the\n\ncourt's instructions on that issue — and we do not suggest that any\n\nerror occurred here — was harmless.             Consequently, we have no need\n\nto address the issue.          See Faigin v. Kelly, 184 F.3d 67, 87 (1st\n\nCir. 1999).\n\n                        B.    The Procedural Objection.\n\n           There is one more bridge to cross. At oral argument, the\n\nplaintiff launched an offensive in the form of a complaint that the\n\ndistrict court failed to follow the procedure delineated in Federal\n\nRule of Civil Procedure 51. This late-blooming claim of procedural\n\nerror posits a mistake of law that, under ordinary circumstances,\n\nwould engender de novo review.            Here, however, the circumstances\n\nare out of the ordinary: the argument is doubly defeated.\n\n           In     the        first     place,    the   plaintiff   did   not\n\ncontemporaneously object when the district court implemented the\n\nchallenged procedure (that is, when it charged the jury without\n\nhaving first presented the parties with the full text of the\n\ncharge).   Thus, the claim of error is not properly before us.           See\n\nUnited States v. Slade, 980 F.2d 27, 30 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"It is a\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\fbedrock rule that when a party has not presented an argument to the\n\ndistrict court, she may not unveil it in the court of appeals.\").\n\nIn the second place, the plaintiff did not proffer this claim of\n\nerror in his opening brief on appeal.             It is common ground that\n\ncontentions not advanced in an appellant's opening brief are deemed\n\nwaived. See Sandstrom v. ChemLawn Corp., 904 F.2d 83, 86 (1st Cir.\n\n1990).\n\n             Even were this contention properly preserved, it would be\n\nfutile.      The plaintiff points out that a recent amendment to Rule\n\n51 requires the court to \"inform the parties of its proposed\n\ninstructions and proposed action on the requests before instructing\n\nthe   jury    and   before   final   jury    arguments,\"   Fed.   R.   Civ.   P.\n\n51(b)(1).       The plaintiff argues that this language in effect\n\ndirects a trial court to provide counsel with a verbatim copy of\n\nits intended jury instructions at the charge conference.               He then\n\nnotes that the court below first informed him of the exact language\n\nof the SSDI instruction when he listened, along with the jury and\n\nopposing counsel, to the charge being delivered in open court.\n\nThis omission, he declares, violated Rule 51(b)(1).\n\n             This is an overly crabbed reading of the rule.            Rule 51,\n\nin its current form, reflects amendments made in 2003.5                  These\n\nrevisions were designed to \"capture many of the interpretations\n\n\n      5\n       To be sure, Rule 51 was further amended in 2007, but the\n2007 revisions were of a purely stylistic nature. Fed. R. Civ. P.\n51 advisory committee's note (2007 amendments).\n\n                                      -18-\n\fthat have emerged in practice.\"              Fed. R. Civ. P. 51 advisory\n\ncommittee's note (2003 amendments).                There is no indication,\n\nhowever, that the drafters envisioned a change in practice as to\n\nhow the charge conference should be conducted; to the contrary, the\n\nrevised version of the rule contains language strongly resembling\n\nthat found in the earlier pre-amendment version.              Compare Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 51(b)(1) (2009) (\"The court must inform the parties of its\n\nproposed instructions . . . before instructing the jury and before\n\nfinal jury arguments . . . .\"), with Fed. R. Civ. P. 51 (2002)\n\n(\"The court shall inform counsel of its proposed action upon the\n\nrequests [for instructions] prior to . . . arguments to the\n\njury.\").\n\n             This family resemblance is critically important because,\n\nunder the earlier version, a number of courts of appeals had held\n\nthat   the    rule   did   not   require    the   delivery   of   written   jury\n\ninstructions to the parties before the court actually delivered the\n\ncharge.      See, e.g., Jones v. S. Pac. R.R., 962 F.2d 447, 451 (5th\n\nCir. 1996); Emerick v. U.S. Suzuki Motor Corp., 750 F.2d 19, 22-23\n\n(3d Cir. 1984); Beimert v. Burlington N., Inc., 726 F.2d 412, 414\n\n(8th Cir. 1984); Puggioni v. Luckenbach S.S. Co., 286 F.2d 340, 344\n\n(2d Cir. 1961).       The relatively minor changes in the text of the\n\nrule do not justify deviating from this uniform result.\n\n             The plaintiff argues that the drafters of the 2003\n\nrevisions      intended    to    equate    \"proposed   action\"    with   \"draft\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\finstructions.\"   We disagree.   The advisory committee's note states\n\nflatly that \"[i]t is enough that counsel know of the intended\n\ninstructions before making final arguments addressed to the issue.\"\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 51 advisory committee's note (2003 amendments).\n\nThat is exactly what the lower court did here.\n\n            In any event, we previously have stated that the post-\n\n2003 version of the rule, Fed. R. Civ. P. 51(b)(1), does not\n\nrequire the trial judge to supply the parties with a written copy\n\nof the instructions before charging the jury.      Cipes v. Mikasa,\n\nInc., 439 F.3d 52, 55 n.1 (1st Cir. 2006).   Sufficiently informing\n\nthe parties of the court's proposed instructions is all that the\n\nrule requires; no particular convention need be employed. See id.;\n\nsee also Fed. R. Civ. P. 51 advisory committee's note (2003\n\namendments) (\"It is enough that counsel know of the intended\n\ninstructions . . . .\").     Indeed, some judges, acting within the\n\nambit of their discretion, prefer to instruct juries orally,\n\nwithout ever preparing written instructions.\n\n            We conclude, without serious question, that a district\n\ncourt is under no obligation to give the parties the full text of\n\nits intended instructions at any time before the jury is charged.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n            We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe affirm the judgment of the district court.\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\f                                Appendix A\n\n\n\nEMILIO DECARO,                               )\n                Plaintiff                    )\n                                             ) C.A. 06-30107-MAP\n                v.                           )\n                                             )\nHASBRO, INC.,                                )\n               Defendant                     )\n\n\n                           SPECIAL VERDICT FORM\n\n\n          We     the   jury   unanimously    respond    to   the   following\nquestions.\n\n          1.

Concluding, as we do, that no substantive or procedural error tainted the challenged jury instructions, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>We rehearse here only those facts necessary to place this appeal in context.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff-appellant Emilio DeCaro worked for defendant-appellee Hasbro, Inc., at its plant in Longmeadow, Massachusetts, for over two decades, most recently as a \"first pressman.\" In that capacity, the plaintiff operated large-scale printing presses used to embellish thousands of sheets of cardboard and paper hourly.</p>\n<p>In 2001, the plaintiff informed Hasbro that his doctors had diagnosed him as afflicted with multiple sclerosis. Notwithstanding this diagnosis, he valiantly continued to work. By 2005, however, his condition had deteriorated and he began a regimen of chemotherapy. He left work and, in July of that year, applied for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff's SSDI application has particular pertinence here. In it, he made a series of factual averments touching upon his physical condition, some in his own hand and others in the form of answers provided orally to a government scrivener who typed his responses into the application. These averments (the accuracy of which was disputed at trial) included claims that the plaintiff was unable to work and descriptions of his particular physical impairments.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*58</span> The plaintiff attempted to return to work on November 29, 2005. A company nurse dashed his hopes; after observing the plaintiff's physical appearance, she forbade him from resuming his position without a doctor's note. On November 30, the plaintiff's physician wrote a letter opining that the plaintiff should eschew employment until the following February.</p>\n<p>On February 2, 2006, the plaintiff again tried to reclaim his job. The company demurred, citing the lack of a contemporaneous medical clearance. This sort of pas de deux occurred at least twice more during the next four months; the short of it is that Hasbro did not allow the plaintiff to return to work.</p>\n<p>Disappointed by Hasbro's unwillingness to restore him to its work force, the plaintiff brought suit against the company in a Massachusetts state court. In his complaint, filed on June 9, 2006, he asserted a gallimaufry of discrimination and breach of contract claims, all arising under state law. This asseverational array included claimed violations of Massachusetts's principal anti-discrimination statute (Massachusetts General Laws ch. 151B).</p>\n<p>Hasbro removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts on the basis of diversity of citizenship and the existence of a controversy in the requisite amount. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. §§ 1332(a)(1), 1441. Following a period of pretrial discovery, the district court granted summary judgment in Hasbro's favor on the breach of contract claim.<sup>[1]</sup> An eight-day jury trial ensued on the state-law discrimination claims.</p>\n<p>As the trial wound down, the district court convened a charge conference, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 51(b), to discuss how the jury was to be instructed. A court reporter attended the charge conference and memorialized what transpired. The court commented upon the parties' proposed instructions and indicated generally which instructions it would give and which it would eschew.</p>\n<p>Among other things, Hasbro proposed an instruction concerning both the effect of the statements contained in the plaintiff's application for SSDI benefits and his receipt of those benefits. Its proposed instruction read in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote>On his application for those benefits Mr. DeCaro represented that he was disabled and unable to work. Mr. DeCaro is bound by his statements on his application for disability and you must presume the truth.</blockquote>\n<p>The court noted that it would give an SSDI instruction, but not one that was stated \"with as much intensity\" as Hasbro's suggested instruction. Instead, the court planned to \"say that the jury is entitled to take into consideration the statements made by Mr. DeCaro in his application for [SSDI] benefits\" and may find that those statements \"are evidence that in fact he viewed himself as unable to perform the essential functions of his job.\"</p>\n<p>Switching to a different subject, the plaintiff noted conflicting characterizations of the evidence about what Hasbro knew anent his disability and whether and when he had requested some sort of accommodation to permit him to work notwithstanding that disability. Accordingly, he proposed an instruction relating to an employer's duty under Massachusetts law to provide a reasonable accommodation, even in the absence of any request that it do so. The court stated that it had read the relevant case law, <i>see, e.g., Leach v. Comm'r of Mass. Rehab. Comm'n,</i> 63 Mass.App.Ct. 563, 827 N.E.2d 745, 749 (2005), and had concluded that Massachusetts law does not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*59</span> impose such an affirmative duty on the employer in the circumstances at hand.</p>\n<p>The attorneys for the parties delivered their summations the next day. Immediately thereafter, the court charged the jury and simultaneously gave a written copy of the charge to each party.</p>\n<p>With respect to the receipt of SSDI benefits and the statements made in the plaintiff's application for those benefits, the court instructed:</p>\n<blockquote>Defendant has pointed to the fact that, while plaintiff was out on voluntary medical leave, plaintiff applied for, and has been continuously receiving, social security disability benefits since November 2005. Plaintiff's application for those benefits included representations about the physical requirements of the first pressman position and statements about his physical limitations at the time of his application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>You should examine the statements made by plaintiff in the application for social security disability benefits and consider whether these statements constitute admissions by him that he was in fact unable to perform the essential functions of his job, with or without a reasonable accommodation, at the time he completed his social security disability application. A plaintiff is not permitted to say one thing in applying for disability benefits and another thing, entirely the opposite, in seeking damages for discrimination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>In making this examination you should consider all the facts and circumstances surrounding the submission of the application. To the extent that you find that statements made in plaintiff's application for social security disability benefits were made by plaintiff, you may decide that they reflected the truth when made, and you may consider them as evidence related to Mr. DeCaro's ability to perform the essential functions of the first pressman position, with or without accommodation, on the dates he attempted to return to work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>At the same time, keep in mind that the standard for determining eligibility for social security disability benefits is different from the standard you must apply in determining whether plaintiff was able, with or without reasonable accommodation, to perform the essential functions of his job. The fact that Mr. DeCaro received social security disability benefits is not in itself necessarily fatal to a claim that he was able to perform the essential functions of his job. However, the receipt of benefits and the statements made by plaintiff in applying for them are items of evidence you may consider in making this determination.</blockquote>\n<p>With respect to the initiation of a reasonable accommodation, the court instructed:</p>\n<blockquote>When a plaintiff in a disability discrimination case contends that he was entitled to a reasonable accommodation in order to perform the essential functions of his job, he must present evidence to persuade the jury that he actually initiated a request for the accommodation and engaged in an interactive process with the employer to work out the possible accommodation. As part of this process the employer may request medical records and make inquires of the employee about his medical condition. If you find on the facts of this case that plaintiff never requested a specific accommodation, then you cannot find that defendant violated plaintiff's rights by failing to offer him one.</blockquote>\n<p>After completing its charge but before allowing the jury to retire, the court brought counsel to sidebar. There  out of the jury's earshot  it inquired about objections. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*60</span> <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 51(b)(2). The plaintiff's attorney objected to the SSDI instruction on two grounds, asserting that the instruction (i) \"simply overstates the law in Massachusetts\" and (ii) should have told the jurors that the receipt of SSDI benefits was \"not fatal at all\" to the claims being tried. The lawyer also objected to the accommodation instruction insofar as it obligated the plaintiff, as a condition precedent to recovery, to request a specific accommodation. The district court overruled these objections and sent the jury to the jury room to deliberate.</p>\n<p>To assist the jurors in their task, the court gave them a written copy of its charge. It also prepared a special verdict form. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 49(a). The form, a replica of which is attached hereto as Appendix A, posed a series of questions. Neither party interposed any objection to either the use or the wording of the special verdict form. The parties thus waived the right to object to these matters on appeal. <i>See </i><i>Clausen v. Sea-3, Inc.,</i> 21 F.3d 1181, 1196 (1st Cir.1994); <i>La Amiga del Pueblo, Inc. v. Robles,</i> 937 F.2d 689, 692 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p>In due course, the jury concluded its deliberations. The first question on the special verdict form has four sub-parts, and the jurors answered all four sub-parts in the negative. These answers memorialized their conclusion that, on the dates in question, the plaintiff was not qualified to perform the essential functions of the first pressman position with or without an accommodation. Because those answers were dispositive, the jury-in accordance with directions contained in the special verdict form-found in favor of Hasbro and refrained from answering any other questions set out in the form.</p>\n<p>This timely appeal ensued. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>We divide our analysis into two segments. The first deals with the objections made at sidebar. The second deals with a newly emergent claim of procedural error.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>The Sidebar Objections.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The plaintiff's briefs assign error to the overruling of his objections to the SSDI and accommodation instructions. The defendant counters, as a threshold matter, that the plaintiff's claims of instructional error have been waived. In its view, the plaintiff failed to comply at sidebar with either Rule 51(c)(1), which requires that an objection \"stat[e] distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds for the objection,\" or Rule 51(d)(1)(B), which requires that an objection to a failure to instruct be accompanied by a statement of the desired instruction.</p>\n<p>The strictures of Rule 51 are not to be taken lightly. <i>Baron v. Suffolk County Sheriff's Dep't,</i> 402 F.3d 225, 235 (1st Cir. 2005). Accordingly, there is a high price to be paid for noncompliance. A substantial failure to comply with those requirements normally results in forfeiture of the objection to which the failure relates. <i>Surprenant v. Rivas,</i> 424 F.3d 5, 15 (1st Cir.2005). Forfeited objections are reviewed only for plain error. <i>Toscano v. Chandris, S.A.,</i> 934 F.2d 383, 385 (1st Cir. 1991); Fed.R.Civ.P. 51(d)(2).</p>\n<p>We begin with the plaintiff's objections to the SSDI instruction. The objections, quoted above, are not models of clarity and, although such objections have to be evaluated in light of the colloquy that transpired at the charge conference the day before, <i>see </i><i>Gray v. Genlyte Group, Inc.,</i> 289 F.3d 128, 133-34 &amp; n. 1 (1st Cir.2002); <i>Wilson v. Mar. Overseas Corp.,</i> 150 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.1998), saying that something \"simply overstates the law\" or that the jury should be admonished that receipt of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*61</span> SSDI benefits is \"not fatal at all\" does not go very far toward preserving particular legal points. This is especially so where, as here, the judge did not say that receipt of the SSDI benefits was fatal. The purpose of a sidebar objection is to inform the judge exactly what he got wrong and what he should do to remedy the incipient harm.</p>\n<p>In this case, the problem is compounded. The plaintiff offers an array of grounds on appeal, and the extent to which each ground might have been apparent from the pretrial discussion varies.</p>\n<p>In the end, however, the degree to which the SSDI objections are or are not preserved does not alter the outcome of the appeal. Consequently, we will assume for argument's sake that the objections to the SSDI instruction were preserved.</p>\n<p>No such reservation is required for the plaintiff's asseveration that the jury should have been instructed on an employer's duty to initiate consideration of a reasonable accommodation. That objection presented a fairly clear choice between giving such an instruction or withholding it, and the objection echoed an instruction proposed by plaintiff's counsel and discussed in some detail at the charge conference. That the objection itself was terse did not, in the idiosyncratic circumstances of this case, deprive it of force. After all, the root purpose of Rule 51 is to ensure that the district court is given actual notice of the nature and grounds of a party's claim that the court's instructions are deficient; style points are not awarded for the form of an objection. <i>See </i><i>Wilson,</i> 150 F.3d at 7.</p>\n<p>We turn, then, to the merits of the objections, starting with a few words about the standard of review.</p>\n<p>Preserved claims of instructional error are reviewed under a split standard. We review de novo questions as to whether jury instructions capture the essence of the applicable law, while reviewing for abuse of discretion questions as to whether the court's choice of phraseology in crafting its jury instructions is unfairly prejudicial. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Nascimento,</i> 491 F.3d 25, 33-34 (1st Cir.2007); <i>Elliott v. S.D. Warren Co.,</i> 134 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p>1. <i>The SSDI Instruction.</i> The plaintiff challenges the SSDI instruction as inconsistent with the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Cleveland v. Policy Management Systems Corp.,</i> 526 U.S. 795, 119 S.Ct. 1597, 143 L.Ed.2d 966 (1999).<sup>[2]</sup> He argues that the effect of the instruction was to establish a forbidden presumption that the receipt of SSDI benefits precludes a finding that an employee is able to perform the essential functions of his job, with or without an accommodation.</p>\n<p>In order to put this claim of error into perspective, it is useful to step back and examine <i>Cleveland.</i> There, a district court granted summary judgment in favor of an employer in a suit brought under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 <i>et seq.</i> The district court reasoned that the plaintiff's application for and receipt of SSDI benefits estopped her as a matter of law from claiming that she was capable of performing the essential functions of her job. The Fifth Circuit affirmed but softened the reasoning; it held that the receipt of SSDI benefits creates a rebuttable presumption that the employee cannot perform the essential functions of her job. <i>Cleveland v. Policy Mgmt. Sys. Corp.,</i> 120 F.3d 513, 518 (5th Cir. 1997). Because the plaintiff had failed to proffer evidence sufficient to overcome that presumption, her appeal failed. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*62</span> The Supreme Court saw the matter differently. The Justices reversed, finding the SSDI scheme and the ADA scheme separate and distinct. 526 U.S. at 801-05, 119 S.Ct. 1597. Consequently, receipt of benefits under the former scheme does not create any presumption (conclusive or rebuttable) with respect to a parallel ADA claim. <i>Id.</i> at 805, 119 S.Ct. 1597. Withal, the Court was careful to note that an employee may not simply ignore seeming contradictions between <i>statements</i> made in an application for SSDI benefits and elements of an ADA claim. <i>Id.</i> at 807, 119 S.Ct. 1597. Rather, the employee must explain such seeming contradictions. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Seen in this light, we believe that the district court's SSDI instruction comports with the thrust of the <i>Cleveland</i> Court's holding. Pertinently, the court told the jury that the mere \"fact that Mr. DeCaro received [SSDI] benefits is not in itself necessarily fatal to his claim.\" The court further told the jury to \"consider\" whether the statements made by the plaintiff in applying for SSDI benefits constituted \"admissions\" as to his inability to perform the essential functions of his job. In resolving that point, the jurors were urged to \"consider all the facts and circumstances.\" Finally, the court warned the jury to \"keep in mind that the standard for determining eligibility for [SSDI] benefits is different from the standard you must apply in determining whether plaintiff was able, with or without reasonable accommodation, to perform the essential functions of his job.\" These are correct statements of the law, consistent both with <i>Cleveland</i> and with Massachusetts law. <i>See </i><i>Russell v. Cooley Dickinson Hosp., Inc.,</i> 437 Mass. 443, 772 N.E.2d 1054, 1062 (2002).</p>\n<p>Relatedly, the plaintiff argues that the court erred in failing either to use the phrase \"not fatal at all\" or to emphasize that a change in conditions from one date to another could constitute an acceptable means of harmonizing seemingly contradictory statements. The first of these points is flatly incorrect: instructing the jury that the plaintiff's statements and the consequent receipt of benefits were \"not fatal at all\" would have usurped the jury's province.<sup>[3]</sup> The point of the <i>Cleveland</i> decision is that such statements may or may not be inimical to an employment discrimination claim. Everything depends on interpretation: how the jurors view the statements and the receipt of benefits in the context of the overall situation.</p>\n<p>The second part of this objection deals with matters of emphasis and choice of phraseology. While it might have been appropriate for the district court to make an express reference to the effect of a \"change in conditions,\" that reference was not required. In instructing a jury, a trial court is not obliged either to embellish legally correct statements or to cover every factual permutation.<sup>[4]</sup><i>Febres v. Challenger Carib. Corp.,</i> 214 F.3d 57, 62-63 (1st Cir.2000); <i>see </i><i>United States v. DeStefano,</i> 59 F.3d 1, 2-3 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n<p>By the same token, we believe that the court's admonition that \"[a] plaintiff is not permitted to say one thing in applying for disability benefits and another thing, entirely the opposite, in seeking damages for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*63</span> discrimination,\" was within the realm of its discretion. That admonition leaves ample room for an explanation as to why two seemingly contradictory statements are not in fact inconsistent.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff makes a last-ditch argument to the SSDI instruction. Citing <i>Rosebud Sioux Tribe v. A &amp; P Steel, Inc.,</i> 733 F.2d 509 (8th Cir.1984), he suggests that a party can successfully appeal a legally correct jury instruction that places undue emphasis on an aspect of the law that favors the other party. <i>See id.</i> at 519. In the abstract, that may well be a correct statement of a legal principle  but the principle has no application here.</p>\n<p>A trial judge has broad discretion in deciding how best to communicate complicated legal rules to a lay jury. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Febres,</i> 214 F.3d at 62-63. That discretion was not exceeded  or even severely tested  in this case. Both the length of the SSDI instruction and its points of emphasis were warranted by the subtlety of the issue.</p>\n<p>To say more about the SSDI instruction would be supererogatory. That instruction is legally correct and, in the final analysis, its phrasing is within the encincture of the district court's discretion. <i>See </i><i>United States v. McGill,</i> 953 F.2d 10, 12 (1st Cir.1992) (\"So long as the charge sufficiently conveys the [party's] theory, it need not parrot the exact language that the [party] prefers.\").</p>\n<p>2. <i>The Accommodation Instruction.</i> The plaintiff's other claim of instructional error need not detain us. He complains of the jury instructions regarding an employer's duty to offer a reasonable accommodation to an employee who suffers from a disability. Specifically, he asserts that, under certain circumstances, an employer may be obliged to initiate a discussion about the feasibility of such an accommodation. <i>See Leach,</i> 827 N.E.2d at 749. This case, he says, called for such an instruction.</p>\n<p>This claim of error is moot. Under the circumstances, an employer's duty to accommodate does not arise unless (at a bare minimum) the employee is able to perform the essential functions of his job with an accommodation. <i>See </i><i>Cleveland,</i> 526 U.S. at 805-06, 119 S.Ct. 1597; <i>Russell,</i> 772 N.E.2d at 1062.</p>\n<p>Here, the jury ended its deliberations once it determined that the plaintiff was not able to perform the essential functions of the first pressman position, with or without an accommodation, on any of the four dates in question. <i>See</i> App'x A. The special verdict form directed the jurors that \"[i]f you have answered `No' as to all four dates, stop.... You will have completed your deliberations.\" <i>Id.</i> That became the law of the case. <i>See </i><i>Clausen,</i> 21 F.3d at 1196. Therefore, the jury never had occasion to reach the logically subsequent question of the employer's duty to accommodate. It follows inexorably that any error regarding the court's instructions on that issue  and we do not suggest that any error occurred here  was harmless. Consequently, we have no need to address the issue. <i>See </i><i>Faigin v. Kelly,</i> 184 F.3d 67, 87 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>The Procedural Objection.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>There is one more bridge to cross. At oral argument, the plaintiff launched an offensive in the form of a complaint that the district court failed to follow the procedure delineated in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 51. This late-blooming claim of procedural error posits a mistake of law that, under ordinary circumstances, would engender de novo review. Here, however, the circumstances are out of the ordinary: the argument is doubly defeated.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*64</span> In the first place, the plaintiff did not contemporaneously object when the district court implemented the challenged procedure (that is, when it charged the jury without having first presented the parties with the full text of the charge). Thus, the claim of error is not properly before us. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Slade,</i> 980 F.2d 27, 30 (1st Cir.1992) (\"It is a bedrock rule that when a party has not presented an argument to the district court, she may not unveil it in the court of appeals.\"). In the second place, the plaintiff did not proffer this claim of error in his opening brief on appeal. It is common ground that contentions not advanced in an appellant's opening brief are deemed waived. <i>See </i><i>Sandstrom v. ChemLawn Corp.,</i> 904 F.2d 83, 86 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n<p>Even were this contention properly preserved, it would be futile. The plaintiff points out that a recent amendment to Rule 51 requires the court to \"inform the parties of its proposed instructions and proposed action on the requests before instructing the jury and before final jury arguments,\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 51(b)(1). The plaintiff argues that this language in effect directs a trial court to provide counsel with a verbatim copy of its intended jury instructions <i>at the charge conference.</i> He then notes that the court below first informed him of the exact language of the SSDI instruction when he listened, along with the jury and opposing counsel, to the charge being delivered in open court. This omission, he declares, violated Rule 51(b)(1).</p>\n<p>This is an overly crabbed reading of the rule. Rule 51, in its current form, reflects amendments made in 2003.<sup>[5]</sup> These revisions were designed to \"capture many of the interpretations that have emerged in practice.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 51 advisory committee's note (2003 amendments). There is no indication, however, that the drafters envisioned a change in practice as to how the charge conference should be conducted; to the contrary, the revised version of the rule contains language strongly resembling that found in the earlier pre-amendment version. <i>Compare</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 51(b)(1) (2009) (\"The court must inform the parties of its proposed instructions ... before instructing the jury and before final jury arguments ....\"), <i>with</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 51 (2002) (\"The court shall inform counsel of its proposed action upon the requests [for instructions] prior to ... arguments to the jury.\").</p>\n<p>This family resemblance is critically important because, under the earlier version, a number of courts of appeals had held that the rule did not require the delivery of written jury instructions to the parties before the court actually delivered the charge. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Jones v. S. Pac. R.R.,</i> 962 F.2d 447, 451 (5th Cir.1992); <i>Emerick v. U.S. Suzuki Motor Corp.,</i> 750 F.2d 19, 22-23 (3d Cir.1984); <i>Beimert v. Burlington N., Inc.,</i> 726 F.2d 412, 414 (8th Cir. 1984); <i>Puggioni v. Luckenbach S.S. Co.,</i> 286 F.2d 340, 344 (2d Cir.1961). The relatively minor changes in the text of the rule do not justify deviating from this uniform result.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff argues that the drafters of the 2003 revisions intended to equate \"proposed action\" with \"draft instructions.\" We disagree. The advisory committee's note states flatly that \"[i]t is enough that counsel know of the intended instructions before making final arguments addressed to the issue.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 51 advisory committee's note (2003 amendments). That is exactly what the lower court did here.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*65</span> In any event, we previously have stated that the post-2003 version of the rule, Fed.R.Civ.P. 51(b)(1), does not require the trial judge to supply the parties with a written copy of the instructions before charging the jury. <i>Cipes v. Mikasa, Inc.,</i> 439 F.3d 52, 55 n. 1 (1st Cir.2006). Sufficiently informing the parties of the court's proposed instructions is all that the rule requires; no particular convention need be employed. <i>See id.; see also</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 51 advisory committee's note (2003 amendments) (\"It is enough that counsel know of the intended instructions....\"). Indeed, some judges, acting within the ambit of their discretion, prefer to instruct juries orally, without ever preparing written instructions.</p>\n<p>We conclude, without serious question, that a district court is under no obligation to give the parties the full text of its intended instructions at any time before the jury is charged.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.

Concluding, as we do, that no substantive or procedural error tainted the challenged jury instructions, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>We rehearse here only those facts necessary to place this appeal in context.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff-appellant Emilio DeCaro worked for defendant-appellee Hasbro, Inc., at its plant in Longmeadow, Massachusetts, for over two decades, most recently as a \"first pressman.\" In that capacity, the plaintiff operated large-scale printing presses used to embellish thousands of sheets of cardboard and paper hourly.</p>\n<p>In 2001, the plaintiff informed Hasbro that his doctors had diagnosed him as afflicted with multiple sclerosis. Notwithstanding this diagnosis, he valiantly continued to work. By 2005, however, his condition had deteriorated and he began a regimen of chemotherapy. He left work and, in July of that year, applied for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff's SSDI application has particular pertinence here. In it, he made a series of factual averments touching upon his physical condition, some in his own hand and others in the form of answers provided orally to a government scrivener who typed his responses into the application. These averments (the accuracy of which was disputed at trial) included claims that the plaintiff was unable to work and descriptions of his particular physical impairments.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*58</span> The plaintiff attempted to return to work on November 29, 2005. A company nurse dashed his hopes; after observing the plaintiff's physical appearance, she forbade him from resuming his position without a doctor's note. On November 30, the plaintiff's physician wrote a letter opining that the plaintiff should eschew employment until the following February.</p>\n<p>On February 2, 2006, the plaintiff again tried to reclaim his job. The company demurred, citing the lack of a contemporaneous medical clearance. This sort of pas de deux occurred at least twice more during the next four months; the short of it is that Hasbro did not allow the plaintiff to return to work.</p>\n<p>Disappointed by Hasbro's unwillingness to restore him to its work force, the plaintiff brought suit against the company in a Massachusetts state court. In his complaint, filed on June 9, 2006, he asserted a gallimaufry of discrimination and breach of contract claims, all arising under state law. This asseverational array included claimed violations of Massachusetts's principal anti-discrimination statute (Massachusetts General Laws ch. 151B).</p>\n<p>Hasbro removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts on the basis of diversity of citizenship and the existence of a controversy in the requisite amount. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. §§ 1332(a)(1), 1441. Following a period of pretrial discovery, the district court granted summary judgment in Hasbro's favor on the breach of contract claim.<sup>[1]</sup> An eight-day jury trial ensued on the state-law discrimination claims.</p>\n<p>As the trial wound down, the district court convened a charge conference, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 51(b), to discuss how the jury was to be instructed. A court reporter attended the charge conference and memorialized what transpired. The court commented upon the parties' proposed instructions and indicated generally which instructions it would give and which it would eschew.</p>\n<p>Among other things, Hasbro proposed an instruction concerning both the effect of the statements contained in the plaintiff's application for SSDI benefits and his receipt of those benefits. Its proposed instruction read in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote>On his application for those benefits Mr. DeCaro represented that he was disabled and unable to work. Mr. DeCaro is bound by his statements on his application for disability and you must presume the truth.</blockquote>\n<p>The court noted that it would give an SSDI instruction, but not one that was stated \"with as much intensity\" as Hasbro's suggested instruction. Instead, the court planned to \"say that the jury is entitled to take into consideration the statements made by Mr. DeCaro in his application for [SSDI] benefits\" and may find that those statements \"are evidence that in fact he viewed himself as unable to perform the essential functions of his job.\"</p>\n<p>Switching to a different subject, the plaintiff noted conflicting characterizations of the evidence about what Hasbro knew anent his disability and whether and when he had requested some sort of accommodation to permit him to work notwithstanding that disability. Accordingly, he proposed an instruction relating to an employer's duty under Massachusetts law to provide a reasonable accommodation, even in the absence of any request that it do so. The court stated that it had read the relevant case law, <i>see, e.g., Leach v. Comm'r of Mass. Rehab. Comm'n,</i> 63 Mass.App.Ct. 563, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">827</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">745</span></span>, 749 (2005), and had concluded that Massachusetts law does not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*59</span> impose such an affirmative duty on the employer in the circumstances at hand.</p>\n<p>The attorneys for the parties delivered their summations the next day. Immediately thereafter, the court charged the jury and simultaneously gave a written copy of the charge to each party.</p>\n<p>With respect to the receipt of SSDI benefits and the statements made in the plaintiff's application for those benefits, the court instructed:</p>\n<blockquote>Defendant has pointed to the fact that, while plaintiff was out on voluntary medical leave, plaintiff applied for, and has been continuously receiving, social security disability benefits since November 2005. Plaintiff's application for those benefits included representations about the physical requirements of the first pressman position and statements about his physical limitations at the time of his application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>You should examine the statements made by plaintiff in the application for social security disability benefits and consider whether these statements constitute admissions by him that he was in fact unable to perform the essential functions of his job, with or without a reasonable accommodation, at the time he completed his social security disability application. A plaintiff is not permitted to say one thing in applying for disability benefits and another thing, entirely the opposite, in seeking damages for discrimination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>In making this examination you should consider all the facts and circumstances surrounding the submission of the application. To the extent that you find that statements made in plaintiff's application for social security disability benefits were made by plaintiff, you may decide that they reflected the truth when made, and you may consider them as evidence related to Mr. DeCaro's ability to perform the essential functions of the first pressman position, with or without accommodation, on the dates he attempted to return to work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>At the same time, keep in mind that the standard for determining eligibility for social security disability benefits is different from the standard you must apply in determining whether plaintiff was able, with or without reasonable accommodation, to perform the essential functions of his job. The fact that Mr. DeCaro received social security disability benefits is not in itself necessarily fatal to a claim that he was able to perform the essential functions of his job. However, the receipt of benefits and the statements made by plaintiff in applying for them are items of evidence you may consider in making this determination.</blockquote>\n<p>With respect to the initiation of a reasonable accommodation, the court instructed:</p>\n<blockquote>When a plaintiff in a disability discrimination case contends that he was entitled to a reasonable accommodation in order to perform the essential functions of his job, he must present evidence to persuade the jury that he actually initiated a request for the accommodation and engaged in an interactive process with the employer to work out the possible accommodation. As part of this process the employer may request medical records and make inquires of the employee about his medical condition. If you find on the facts of this case that plaintiff never requested a specific accommodation, then you cannot find that defendant violated plaintiff's rights by failing to offer him one.</blockquote>\n<p>After completing its charge but before allowing the jury to retire, the court brought counsel to sidebar. There  out of the jury's earshot  it inquired about objections. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*60</span> <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 51(b)(2). The plaintiff's attorney objected to the SSDI instruction on two grounds, asserting that the instruction (i) \"simply overstates the law in Massachusetts\" and (ii) should have told the jurors that the receipt of SSDI benefits was \"not fatal at all\" to the claims being tried. The lawyer also objected to the accommodation instruction insofar as it obligated the plaintiff, as a condition precedent to recovery, to request a specific accommodation. The district court overruled these objections and sent the jury to the jury room to deliberate.</p>\n<p>To assist the jurors in their task, the court gave them a written copy of its charge. It also prepared a special verdict form. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 49(a). The form, a replica of which is attached hereto as Appendix A, posed a series of questions. Neither party interposed any objection to either the use or the wording of the special verdict form. The parties thus waived the right to object to these matters on appeal. <i>See </i><i>Clausen v. Sea-3, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"668217\"><a href=\"/opinion/668217/eric-clausen-v-sea-3-inc-storage-tank-development-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1181</span></a></span>, 1196 (1st Cir.1994); <i>La Amiga del Pueblo, Inc. v.

The first question on the special verdict form has four sub-parts, and the jurors answered all four sub-parts in the negative. These answers memorialized their conclusion that, on the dates in question, the plaintiff was not qualified to perform the essential functions of the first pressman position with or without an accommodation. Because those answers were dispositive, the jury-in accordance with directions contained in the special verdict form-found in favor of Hasbro and refrained from answering any other questions set out in the form.</p>\n<p>This timely appeal ensued. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>We divide our analysis into two segments. The first deals with the objections made at sidebar. The second deals with a newly emergent claim of procedural error.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>The Sidebar Objections.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The plaintiff's briefs assign error to the overruling of his objections to the SSDI and accommodation instructions. The defendant counters, as a threshold matter, that the plaintiff's claims of instructional error have been waived. In its view, the plaintiff failed to comply at sidebar with either Rule 51(c)(1), which requires that an objection \"stat[e] distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds for the objection,\" or Rule 51(d)(1)(B), which requires that an objection to a failure to instruct be accompanied by a statement of the desired instruction.</p>\n<p>The strictures of Rule 51 are not to be taken lightly. <i>Baron v. Suffolk County Sheriff's Dep't,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201506\"><a href=\"/opinion/201506/baron-v-suffolk-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">225</span></a></span>, 235 (1st Cir. 2005). Accordingly, there is a high price to be paid for noncompliance. A substantial failure to comply with those requirements normally results in forfeiture of the objection to which the failure relates. <i>Surprenant v. Rivas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201815\"><a href=\"/opinion/201815/surprenant-v-rivas/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 15 (1st Cir.2005). Forfeited objections are reviewed only for plain error. <i>Toscano v. Chandris, S.A.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"562036\"><a href=\"/opinion/562036/frank-toscano-v-chandris-sa/\"><span class=\"volume\">934</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">383</span></a></span>, 385 (1st Cir. 1991); Fed.R.Civ.P. 51(d)(2).</p>\n<p>We begin with the plaintiff's objections to the SSDI instruction. The objections, quoted above, are not models of clarity and, although such objections have to be evaluated in light of the colloquy that transpired at the charge conference the day before, <i>see </i><i>Gray v. Genlyte Group, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199969\"><a href=\"/opinion/199969/gray-v-genlyte-group-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">289</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">128</span></a></span>, 133-34 &amp; n. 1 (1st Cir.2002); <i>Wilson v. Mar. Overseas Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"756417\"><a href=\"/opinion/756417/eric-wilson-v-maritime-overseas-corporation-and-cambridge-tankers-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir.1998), saying that something \"simply overstates the law\" or that the jury should be admonished that receipt of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*61</span> SSDI benefits is \"not fatal at all\" does not go very far toward preserving particular legal points. This is especially so where, as here, the judge did not say that receipt of the SSDI benefits was fatal. The purpose of a sidebar objection is to inform the judge exactly what he got wrong and what he should do to remedy the incipient harm.</p>\n<p>In this case, the problem is compounded. The plaintiff offers an array of grounds on appeal, and the extent to which each ground might have been apparent from the pretrial discussion varies.</p>\n<p>In the end, however, the degree to which the SSDI objections are or are not preserved does not alter the outcome of the appeal. Consequently, we will assume for argument's sake that the objections to the SSDI instruction were preserved.</p>\n<p>No such reservation is required for the plaintiff's asseveration that the jury should have been instructed on an employer's duty to initiate consideration of a reasonable accommodation. That objection presented a fairly clear choice between giving such an instruction or withholding it, and the objection echoed an instruction proposed by plaintiff's counsel and discussed in some detail at the charge conference. That the objection itself was terse did not, in the idiosyncratic circumstances of this case, deprive it of force. After all, the root purpose of Rule 51 is to ensure that the district court is given actual notice of the nature and grounds of a party's claim that the court's instructions are deficient; style points are not awarded for the form of an objection. <i>See </i><i>Wilson,</i> 150 F.3d at 7.</p>\n<p>We turn, then, to the merits of the objections, starting with a few words about the standard of review.</p>\n<p>Preserved claims of instructional error are reviewed under a split standard. We review de novo questions as to whether jury instructions capture the essence of the applicable law, while reviewing for abuse of discretion questions as to whether the court's choice of phraseology in crafting its jury instructions is unfairly prejudicial. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Nascimento,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202833\"><a href=\"/opinion/202833/united-states-v-nascimento/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 33-34 (1st Cir.2007); <i>Elliott v.

Policy Management Systems Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118294\"><a href=\"/opinion/118294/cleveland-v-policy-management-systems-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">795</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118294\"><a href=\"/opinion/118294/cleveland-v-policy-management-systems-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">966</span></a></span> (1999).<sup>[2]</sup> He argues that the effect of the instruction was to establish a forbidden presumption that the receipt of SSDI benefits precludes a finding that an employee is able to perform the essential functions of his job, with or without an accommodation.</p>\n<p>In order to put this claim of error into perspective, it is useful to step back and examine <i>Cleveland.</i> There, a district court granted summary judgment in favor of an employer in a suit brought under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 <i>et seq.</i> The district court reasoned that the plaintiff's application for and receipt of SSDI benefits estopped her as a matter of law from claiming that she was capable of performing the essential functions of her job. The Fifth Circuit affirmed but softened the reasoning; it held that the receipt of SSDI benefits creates a rebuttable presumption that the employee cannot perform the essential functions of her job. <i>Cleveland v. Policy Mgmt. Sys. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">513</span></span>, 518 (5th Cir. 1997). Because the plaintiff had failed to proffer evidence sufficient to overcome that presumption, her appeal failed. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*62</span> The Supreme Court saw the matter differently. The Justices reversed, finding the SSDI scheme and the ADA scheme separate and distinct. 526 U.S. at 801-05, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118294\"><a href=\"/opinion/118294/cleveland-v-policy-management-systems-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1597</span></a></span>. Consequently, receipt of benefits under the former scheme does not create any presumption (conclusive or rebuttable) with respect to a parallel ADA claim. <i>Id.</i> at 805, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118294\"><a href=\"/opinion/118294/cleveland-v-policy-management-systems-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1597</span></a></span>. Withal, the Court was careful to note that an employee may not simply ignore seeming contradictions between <i>statements</i> made in an application for SSDI benefits and elements of an ADA claim. <i>Id.</i> at 807, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118294\"><a href=\"/opinion/118294/cleveland-v-policy-management-systems-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1597</span></a></span>. Rather, the employee must explain such seeming contradictions. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Seen in this light, we believe that the district court's SSDI instruction comports with the thrust of the <i>Cleveland</i> Court's holding. Pertinently, the court told the jury that the mere \"fact that Mr. DeCaro received [SSDI] benefits is not in itself necessarily fatal to his claim.\" The court further told the jury to \"consider\" whether the statements made by the plaintiff in applying for SSDI benefits constituted \"admissions\" as to his inability to perform the essential functions of his job. In resolving that point, the jurors were urged to \"consider all the facts and circumstances.\" Finally, the court warned the jury to \"keep in mind that the standard for determining eligibility for [SSDI] benefits is different from the standard you must apply in determining whether plaintiff was able, with or without reasonable accommodation, to perform the essential functions of his job.\" These are correct statements of the law, consistent both with <i>Cleveland</i> and with Massachusetts law. <i>See </i><i>Russell v. Cooley Dickinson Hosp., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">437</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">772</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1054</span></span>, 1062 (2002).</p>\n<p>Relatedly, the plaintiff argues that the court erred in failing either to use the phrase \"not fatal at all\" or to emphasize that a change in conditions from one date to another could constitute an acceptable means of harmonizing seemingly contradictory statements. The first of these points is flatly incorrect: instructing the jury that the plaintiff's statements and the consequent receipt of benefits were \"not fatal at all\" would have usurped the jury's province.<sup>[3]</sup> The point of the <i>Cleveland</i> decision is that such statements may or may not be inimical to an employment discrimination claim. Everything depends on interpretation: how the jurors view the statements and the receipt of benefits in the context of the overall situation.</p>\n<p>The second part of this objection deals with matters of emphasis and choice of phraseology. While it might have been appropriate for the district court to make an express reference to the effect of a \"change in conditions,\" that reference was not required. In instructing a jury, a trial court is not obliged either to embellish legally correct statements or to cover every factual permutation.<sup>[4]</sup><i>Febres v. Challenger Carib. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198959\"><a href=\"/opinion/198959/febres-morales-v-caribbean/\"><span class=\"volume\">214</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span>, 62-63 (1st Cir.2000); <i>see </i><i>United States v. DeStefano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196179\"><a href=\"/opinion/196179/united-states-v-destefano/\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 2-3 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n<p>By the same token, we believe that the court's admonition that \"[a] plaintiff is not permitted to say one thing in applying for disability benefits and another thing, entirely the opposite, in seeking damages for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*63</span> discrimination,\" was within the realm of its discretion. That admonition leaves ample room for an explanation as to why two seemingly contradictory statements are not in fact inconsistent.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff makes a last-ditch argument to the SSDI instruction. Citing <i>Rosebud Sioux Tribe v. A &amp; P Steel, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"435064\"><a href=\"/opinion/435064/rosebud-sioux-tribe-v-a-p-steel-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">733</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">509</span></a></span> (8th Cir.1984), he suggests that a party can successfully appeal a legally correct jury instruction that places undue emphasis on an aspect of the law that favors the other party. <i>See id.</i> at 519. In the abstract, that may well be a correct statement of a legal principle  but the principle has no application here.</p>\n<p>A trial judge has broad discretion in deciding how best to communicate complicated legal rules to a lay jury. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Febres,</i> 214 F.3d at 62-63. That discretion was not exceeded  or even severely tested  in this case. Both the length of the SSDI instruction and its points of emphasis were warranted by the subtlety of the issue.</p>\n<p>To say more about the SSDI instruction would be supererogatory. That instruction is legally correct and, in the final analysis, its phrasing is within the encincture of the district court's discretion. <i>See </i><i>United States v. McGill,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"575209\"><a href=\"/opinion/575209/united-states-v-robert-l-mcgill/\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, 12 (1st Cir.1992) (\"So long as the charge sufficiently conveys the [party's] theory, it need not parrot the exact language that the [party] prefers.\").</p>\n<p>2. <i>The Accommodation Instruction.</i> The plaintiff's other claim of instructional error need not detain us. He complains of the jury instructions regarding an employer's duty to offer a reasonable accommodation to an employee who suffers from a disability. Specifically, he asserts that, under certain circumstances, an employer may be obliged to initiate a discussion about the feasibility of such an accommodation. <i>See Leach,</i> 827 N.E.2d at 749. This case, he says, called for such an instruction.</p>\n<p>This claim of error is moot. Under the circumstances, an employer's duty to accommodate does not arise unless (at a bare minimum) the employee is able to perform the essential functions of his job with an accommodation. <i>See </i><i>Cleveland,</i> 526 U.S. at 805-06, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118294\"><a href=\"/opinion/118294/cleveland-v-policy-management-systems-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1597</span></a></span>; <i>Russell,</i> 772 N.E.2d at 1062.</p>\n<p>Here, the jury ended its deliberations once it determined that the plaintiff was not able to perform the essential functions of the first pressman position, with or without an accommodation, on any of the four dates in question. <i>See</i> App'x A. The special verdict form directed the jurors that \"[i]f you have answered `No' as to all four dates, stop.... You will have completed your deliberations.\" <i>Id.</i> That became the law of the case. <i>See </i><i>Clausen,</i> 21 F.3d at 1196. Therefore, the jury never had occasion to reach the logically subsequent question of the employer's duty to accommodate. It follows inexorably that any error regarding the court's instructions on that issue  and we do not suggest that any error occurred here  was harmless. Consequently, we have no need to address the issue. <i>See </i><i>Faigin v. Kelly,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198558\"><a href=\"/opinion/198558/faigin-v-kelly-carucci/\"><span class=\"volume\">184</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></a></span>, 87 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>The Procedural Objection.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>There is one more bridge to cross. At oral argument, the plaintiff launched an offensive in the form of a complaint that the district court failed to follow the procedure delineated in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 51. This late-blooming claim of procedural error posits a mistake of law that, under ordinary circumstances, would engender de novo review. Here, however, the circumstances are out of the ordinary: the argument is doubly defeated.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*64</span> In the first place, the plaintiff did not contemporaneously object when the district court implemented the challenged procedure (that is, when it charged the jury without having first presented the parties with the full text of the charge). Thus, the claim of error is not properly before us. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Slade,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"595481\"><a href=\"/opinion/595481/united-states-v-frances-slade/\"><span class=\"volume\">980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 30 (1st Cir.1992) (\"It is a bedrock rule that when a party has not presented an argument to the district court, she may not unveil it in the court of appeals.\"). In the second place, the plaintiff did not proffer this claim of error in his opening brief on appeal. It is common ground that contentions not advanced in an appellant's opening brief are deemed waived. <i>See </i><i>Sandstrom v. ChemLawn Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"542293\"><a href=\"/opinion/542293/richard-l-sandstrom-etc-v-chemlawn-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">904</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, 86 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n<p>Even were this contention properly preserved, it would be futile. The plaintiff points out that a recent amendment to Rule 51 requires the court to \"inform the parties of its proposed instructions and proposed action on the requests before instructing the jury and before final jury arguments,\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 51(b)(1). The plaintiff argues that this language in effect directs a trial court to provide counsel with a verbatim copy of its intended jury instructions <i>at the charge conference.</i> He then notes that the court below first informed him of the exact language of the SSDI instruction when he listened, along with the jury and opposing counsel, to the charge being delivered in open court. This omission, he declares, violated Rule 51(b)(1).</p>\n<p>This is an overly crabbed reading of the rule. Rule 51, in its current form, reflects amendments made in 2003.<sup>[5]</sup> These revisions were designed to \"capture many of the interpretations that have emerged in practice.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 51 advisory committee's note (2003 amendments). There is no indication, however, that the drafters envisioned a change in practice as to how the charge conference should be conducted; to the contrary, the revised version of the rule contains language strongly resembling that found in the earlier pre-amendment version. <i>Compare</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 51(b)(1) (2009) (\"The court must inform the parties of its proposed instructions ... before instructing the jury and before final jury arguments ....\"), <i>with</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 51 (2002) (\"The court shall inform counsel of its proposed action upon the requests [for instructions] prior to ... arguments to the jury.\").</p>\n<p>This family resemblance is critically important because, under the earlier version, a number of courts of appeals had held that the rule did not require the delivery of written jury instructions to the parties before the court actually delivered the charge. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Jones v.

The relatively minor changes in the text of the rule do not justify deviating from this uniform result.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff argues that the drafters of the 2003 revisions intended to equate \"proposed action\" with \"draft instructions.\" We disagree. The advisory committee's note states flatly that \"[i]t is enough that counsel know of the intended instructions before making final arguments addressed to the issue.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 51 advisory committee's note (2003 amendments). That is exactly what the lower court did here.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*65</span> In any event, we previously have stated that the post-2003 version of the rule, Fed.R.Civ.P. 51(b)(1), does not require the trial judge to supply the parties with a written copy of the instructions before charging the jury. <i>Cipes v. Mikasa, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202086\"><a href=\"/opinion/202086/cipes-v-mikasa-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">439</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span>, 55 n. 1 (1st Cir.2006). Sufficiently informing the parties of the court's proposed instructions is all that the rule requires; no particular convention need be employed. <i>See id.; see also</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 51 advisory committee's note (2003 amendments) (\"It is enough that counsel know of the intended instructions....\"). Indeed, some judges, acting within the ambit of their discretion, prefer to instruct juries orally, without ever preparing written instructions.</p>\n<p>We conclude, without serious question, that a district court is under no obligation to give the parties the full text of its intended instructions at any time before the jury is charged.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Appendix A</i></h2>\nEMILIO DECARO, Plaintiff\nv.\nHASBRO, INC., Defendant\nC.A. 06-30107-MAP\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>SPECIAL VERDICT FORM</i></h2>\n<p>We the jury unanimously respond to the following questions.</p>\n<p>1. Has Plaintiff proved by a preponderance of the evidence that he was able to perform the essential functions of the First Pressman position, with or without reasonable accommodation, on one of more of the following dates:</p>\nNovember 29, 2005              _______   _______\n                               Yes       No\nFebruary 2, 2006               _______   _______\n                               Yes       No\nMay 15, 2006                   _______   _______\n                               Yes       No\nJune 6, 2006                   _______   _______\n                               Yes       No\n<p><i>Note:</i> If you answered \"No\" as to all four dates, stop. The foreperson should sign the verdict slip. You will have completed your deliberations.</p>\n<p>2. Has Plaintiff proved by a preponderance of the evidence that discrimination by Defendant based on Plaintiff's handicap was a determinative cause of Defendant's decision not to permit Plaintiff to return to work, or not to offer Plaintiff a reasonable, requested accommodation, on one or more of the following dates:</p>\nNovember 29, 2005              _______   _______\n                               Yes       No\nFebruary 2, 2006               _______   _______\n                               Yes       No\nMay 15, 2006                   _______   _______\n                               Yes       No\nJune 6, 2006                   _______   _______\n                               Yes       No\n<p><i>Note:</i> If you answered \"No\" as to all four dates, stop. The foreperson should sign the verdict slip. You will have completed your deliberations. If you have answered \"Yes\" as to one or more of the same dates in both Questions 1 and 2, then proceed to the next question.</p>\n<p>3. What is the amount of damages that will fairly and reasonably compensate Plaintiff for his lost past wages and emotional distress caused by Defendant's discriminatory conduct?</p>\n________________________________________ (in words)\n$_________. _______ (in figures)\n_______________    _________\nForeperson         Date\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  That ruling is not challenged on appeal and, thus, we do not dwell on it.</p>\n<p>[2]  The reasoning of the <i>Cleveland</i> Court has been adopted by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. <i>See </i><i>Russell v. Cooley Dickinson Hosp., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">437</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">772</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1054</span></span>, 1062 (2002).</p>\n<p>[3]  While the court's use of the phrase \"not in itself necessarily fatal\" may have been an awkward locution, that wording is reminiscent of similar language in both <i>Cleveland,</i> 526 U.S. at 797, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118294\"><a href=\"/opinion/118294/cleveland-v-policy-management-systems-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1597</span></a></span> (using the phrase \"does not necessarily estop\"), and <i>Russell,</i> 772 N.E.2d at 1062 (similar).</p>\n<p>[4]  Let us be perfectly clear: we do not suggest that the instruction given by the district court would necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances. Consequently, we do not foreclose the possibility that, in a future case, a different or more detailed instruction might be required, depending on the facts and the issues.</p>\n<p>[5]  To be sure, Rule 51 was further amended in 2007, but the 2007 revisions were of a purely stylistic nature.
