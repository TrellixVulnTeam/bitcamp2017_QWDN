Paul J. Barbadoro,          U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                    Torruella, Lynch and Lipez,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Jennifer A.

Howard, Assistant U.S. Attorney, and Thomas           P.\nColantuono, United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           October 27, 2006\n\f             Per     Curiam.         Defendant-appellant               José    Hernandez\n\n(\"Hernandez\")        appeals      from    his        188-month        within-guidelines\n\nsentence. As grounds for appeal, he argues that the district court\n\ndid not adequately explain the reasons for the sentence in terms of\n\nthe factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) and that the sentence\n\nimposed     was     unreasonably     high       in     light     of    those    factors,\n\nparticularly        given   his    cooperation          with     the    government   in\n\nprosecuting and investigating other crimes.1                   Notably, he does not\n\nargue that he was entitled to a downward departure below the\n\nstatutory minimum of 180 months2 under U.S.S.G. § 5K1.1 or 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3553(e).         Thus, what is at issue here is the eight-month\n\ndifference between the statutory minimum and the sentence imposed.\n\n             As we have previously stated in the wake of United States\n\nv. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005), \"Reasonableness entails a range of\n\npotential sentences, as opposed to a single precise result.\"\n\nUnited     States    v.   Dixon,    449   F.3d       194,   204   (1st     Cir.   2006).\n\nConsequently, \"appellate review of a district court's post-Booker\n\nsentencing decision focuses on whether the court has 'adequately\n\nexplained its reasons for varying or declining to vary from the\n\n\n     1\n      At the end of his brief, Hernandez makes the further claim\nthat \"he was denied his constitutional rights to due process as\nguaranteed by the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the\nConstitution of the United States.\"    That conclusory statement,\nwithout further development, is insufficient to preserve any due\nprocess claim for our consideration. United States v. Zannino, 895\nF.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n     2\n         See 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(a)(1), 924(e).\n\n                                          -2-\n\fguidelines and whether the result is within reasonable limits.'\"\n\nDixon, 449 F.3d at 204 (quoting United States v. Scherrer, 444 F.3d\n\n91, 93 (1st Cir. 2006) (en banc)).        Conversely, \"in attacking a in-\n\nguideline-range sentence as excessive, a defendant . . . usually\n\nha[s] to adduce fairly powerful mitigating reasons and persuade us\n\nthat the district judge was unreasonable in balancing pros and cons\n\ndespite the latitude implicit in saying that a sentence must be\n\n'reasonable.'\" United States v. Navedo-Concepción, 450 F.3d 54, 59\n\n(1st Cir. 2006); see also United States v. Smith, 445 F.3d 1, 4\n\n(1st Cir. 2006).\n\n           The explanation provided by the district court here\n\neasily passes muster. In sentencing Hernandez to the bottom of the\n\napplicable guideline range, rather than eight months less, the\n\ndistrict court expressly considered each of the mitigating factors\n\nproffered by Hernandez--his cooperation with state and federal law\n\nenforcement officials in their investigation and prosecution of\n\nother crimes, his young age when he committed the prior offenses on\n\nwhich his armed career criminal conviction was based, and his\n\naddiction to cocaine--but concluded that they were outweighed by\n\nother relevant factors. In particular, the court found the within-\n\nguidelines sentence to be appropriate based on the nature of his\n\noffense,   which   involved   not   merely    possessing   a   firearm   but\n\nbrandishing it to terrorize others and holding it to someone's\n\nchest to steal cocaine, and the seriousness of his criminal record,\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fwhich included two other violent felonies and a serious drug-\n\ntrafficking offense.\n\n              The court's reasons for rejecting Hernandez's arguments\n\nfor a more lenient sentence are apparent from the sentencing\n\ntranscript. As to Hernandez's cooperation, the court stated that\n\nHernandez \"ha[d] already received a substantial benefit from that\n\ncooperation,\" referring to the government's dismissal of two other\n\ncounts and a pending supervised release violation, which would have\n\nincreased his sentence by at least 84 months.3              The court took\n\ninto account not only Hernandez's cooperation in a successful\n\nmurder prosecution, which was the quid pro quo for the dismissal of\n\nthe remaining counts, but also his further attempts to cooperate in\n\ninvestigating other crimes.       The court declined to give him credit\n\nfor those other attempts both because the government did not deem\n\nthem helpful and because they admittedly involved further criminal\n\nactivity on his part.\n\n              As to Hernandez's plea for leniency on account of his\n\nyoung age when he committed his prior offenses, the court found\n\nthat argument \"disingenuous\" since there was no long gap between\n\nhis   prior    offenses   and   the   offense   of   conviction,   which   was\n\ncommitted while he was still on supervised release for his most\n\n\n\n      3\n      One of the dismissed counts--for possession and brandishing\nof a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking offense--carried\na mandatory minimum consecutive sentence of seven years. 18 U.S.C.\n§ 924(c)(1)(D)(ii).\n\n                                      -4-\n\frecent prior offense.       Indeed, the court noted that \"[t]he only\n\nexplanation for him not committing other offenses [in the interim]\n\nis that he's been in prison during all that time.\"\n\n              Finally, although the court recognized Hernandez's drug\n\naddiction and need for treatment, it concluded that those factors\n\ndid not warrant a below-guidelines sentence.              In reaching that\n\nconclusion, the court was influenced by the fact that Hernandez had\n\nfalsely denied his addiction to avoid being placed in a substance\n\nabuse treatment program while on supervised release for a prior\n\noffense. The court did, however, address Hernandez's need for drug\n\ntreatment by recommending that he be permitted to participate in\n\nthe intensive drug education and treatment program while imprisoned\n\nand requiring that he participate in a drug treatment program while\n\non supervised release.\n\n              We see nothing implausible about those explanations,\n\nwhich   are    fully   supported   by    undisputed   facts,   and   find   the\n\nresulting sentence to be well within the realm of reasonableness.\n\nAccordingly, we affirm.      See 1st Cir. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\f",
