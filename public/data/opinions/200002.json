This case, which unfolded\n\nagainst a backdrop of small town intrigue that would have excited\n\nthe imagination of Grace Metalious,1 raises interesting questions\nabout bifurcation, a common practice in police civil rights cases,\n\nand the extent to which the parties to a case may be bound on\n\nappeal by their strategic choices at trial.\n\n             After   a   drunk    driving   arrest    and   a   station   house\n\naltercation, plaintiff-appellant Richard Wilson sued the Towns of\n\nMendon and Hopedale, their respective chiefs of police, and five\n\nMendon and Hopedale police officers.           Prior to trial, Magistrate\nJudge Swartwood, presiding with the parties’ consent, bifurcated\n\nWilson’s claims against the individual defendants from his claims\nagainst the Towns.        As the trial date approached, the roster of\ndefendants shrank. Ultimately, a jury entered verdicts in favor of\n\ndefendant-appellee James Crosby, a Mendon police officer, and\nStephen Sweet, a Hopedale police officer, on claims that they had\nused excessive force in subduing Wilson.2            The jury also found for\n\ndefendant-appellee Dennis Grady, the Mendon Chief of Police, on\nclaims of negligent training and supervision.                   Following the\nverdict,     Magistrate   Judge    Swartwood   entered      judgment   for   all\n\ndefendants including the Town of Mendon.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n         Peyton Place (Doubleday, 1956).\n     2\n      Wilson appeals from the final judgment entered in favor of\nthe Town of Mendon, Crosby and Chief Grady. He has not appealed\nthe verdict favorable to Sweet.\n\n                                      -2-\n\f             Wilson    raises     four      issues    on   appeal.       He       claims\n\nreversible error in: (1) the Magistrate Judge’s refusal to submit\n\na special verdict question to the jury regarding a non-defendant\nofficer’s alleged use of excessive force; (2) the court’s refusal\n\nto permit expert testimony on the same subject;                   (3) the court’s\n\nrefusal to instruct the jury on theories of joint venture and\nfailure to        intervene;    and   (4)    the     court’s   refusal    to      strike\n\ndisparaging comments made during closing argument about one of\n\nWilson’s lawyers.       While we are of the view that the trial court\n\nwas mistaken about the law in one respect, we discern no prejudice,\n\nand we therefore affirm the verdict.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n             A.    Relevant Facts\n\n             We recite the facts in the light most favorable to the\n\nverdict.     Ferragamo v. Chubb Life Ins. Co., 94 F.3d 26, 27 n.1 (1st\n\nCir. 1996).       On May 18, 1996, officer James Crosby, while on patrol\n\non   North    Street    in     Mendon,   Massachusetts,        observed       a    green\n\nconvertible stray across the double yellow median line and then\ndrift back to the shoulder of the road, narrowly missing a parked\n\nvehicle.     Crosby activated his auxiliary lights and signaled the\n\ncar to stop. On approaching the driver’s side of the car, Crosby\ndetected a mild odor of alcohol.                Crosby observed a passenger,\nNancy Wilson, lying face down with her head wedged between the\n\nconvertible’s front bucket seats.              When Crosby asked the driver,\nRichard Wilson, whether his female passenger was all right, he\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\freplied, \"she’s f’in cocked.\"        Crosby summoned officer Kristen\n\nCarchedi to the scene to attend to Nancy Wilson.          Officer Sherri\n\nTagliaferri also responded to the call, and assisted Carchedi and\nCrosby in taking Nancy Wilson into protective custody.3\n\n             At Crosby’s request, Richard Wilson produced a valid\n\ndriver’s     license   but   was   unable   to   locate   the   vehicle’s\nregistration papers.     Suspecting that Wilson might be intoxicated,\n\nCrosby directed him to perform several field sobriety tests.          The\n\nresults were sufficiently suggestive to cause Crosby to place\n\nWilson under arrest for operating under the influence.4         Upon being\n\nplaced in the rear compartment of Crosby’s cruiser, Wilson began\n\nscreaming epithets and slamming his body against the back of the\n\nseat.\n             At the station, while Crosby was completing booking\n\nformalities, Wilson again became belligerent.       Crosby escorted him\n\nto a cell.      Once inside, Wilson began to kick at the cell door.\nCrosby ordered Wilson to stop. When Wilson persisted in kicking at\n\nthe door, Crosby ordered him to step out of the cell.5             Wilson\nrefused to comply.      Officer Tagliaferri then attempted to flush\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      Nancy Wilson was taken by ambulance to the station after she\nbegan to vomit. She was released to her father’s custody before\nthe altercation at the station began.\n     4\n      Wilson had difficulty performing a heel-to-toe test, and\nspoke in a thick-tongued and studied manner while reciting the\nalphabet.\n     5\n         Crosby’s intent was to manacle Wilson’s legs.\n\n                                   -4-\n\fWilson from the cell by spraying him with pepper gas.6            Unable to\n\nfind her target, Tagliaferri gave the gas cannister to Crosby, who\n\nafter several attempts, succeeded in squirting the gas in Wilson’s\nface.       Wilson responded with a tirade of threats and obscenities.\n\nAlarmed by the ferocity of Wilson’s outburst, Crosby asked that\n\nreinforcements be summoned from the neighboring Town of Hopedale.7\n\n               Wilson in the meantime succeeded in kicking open the door\n\nof the cell.         He then rushed into the vestibule of the cellblock\n\nwith Crosby and Tagliaferri in hot pursuit.                 Crosby leapt on\n\nWilson’s back while Tagliaferri grabbed Wilson’s feet.            Wilson and\n\nthe officers tumbled to the floor where the scrimmage continued.\n\nCarchedi, who was not present when the struggle began, suddenly\n\nappeared, and from a crouching position let loose a spray of pepper\ngas,       hitting   Wilson   and   Crosby   in   the   face.8   Crosby   and\n\nTagliaferri eventually succeeded in manacling Wilson's legs.\n\n               At some point during the struggle, Wilson suffered a cut\nto his chin, prompting Crosby to request that an ambulance be\n\n\n\n\n       6\n      Pepper gas, or oleoresin capsicum, is an aerosol spray made\nfrom an oily extract of the capsicum pepper plant. When inhaled,\nit induces coughing, a gagging sensation, and an inability to\nvocalize.   It is a less powerful version of the irritant gases\nmarketed under the trade name Mace, and its use is authorized under\nstandard police protocols in less threatening instances than those\nin which the use of Mace is sanctioned.\n       7\n      Crosby and the two female officers, Carchedi and Tagliaferri,\nwere the total Mendon complement then on duty.\n       8\n      For conceptual clarity, we will refer to a first spraying\nincident, the one involving Crosby and Tagliaferri, and a second\nspraying incident involving Carchedi.\n\n                                       -5-\n\fcalled.9 While waiting for the ambulance, Crosby handcuffed Wilson\n\nto a restraining rail, after which Wilson spat at him.    Once the\n\nambulance arrived, Crosby unshackled Wilson from the rail, and\nplaced him prone on the floor.    Officer Sweet, who was assisting\n\nCrosby, restrained Wilson by placing his foot on Wilson’s back.\n\nWilson was taken, still manacled, by stretcher to the ambulance.\nCrosby accompanied Wilson to the hospital.    During the ambulance\n\n\n\n     9\n      Wilson’s testimony at trial portrayed Crosby in a less\nflattering light.     According to Wilson, he began voluntarily\nwalking towards the cell after Crosby refused him permission to\nmake a telephone call to his uncle, a police detective in a\nneighboring town. Enraged, Crosby shoved Wilson against a wall,\nknocked him to the ground, and dragged him into the cell with his\nhands cuffed behind his back.     Once in the cell, Crosby kneed\nWilson in the ribs and punched him several times. Wilson admitted\nto shouting obscenities and kicking at the cell door in response to\nCrosby’s taunts, but claimed to have regained his composure when\nCrosby, without warning, opened the cell door and sprayed several\njets of pepper gas, striking Wilson in the face on the third\nattempt. Crosby threw Wilson against the wall before leaving the\ncell. Wilson succeeded in kicking the cell door open to escape\nfrom the fumes. He then ran into the vestibule searching for Nancy\nWilson. Crosby jumped him from behind, while Tagliaferri tackled\nhis legs.    Wilson testified that after he was wrestled to the\nfloor, Carchedi ordered Crosby to lift his [Wilson’s] head so that\nshe could spray him in \"the f’in face.\" Crosby wrenched Wilson’s\nhead back while Carchedi sprayed both men in the face.       Wilson\nstated that he could not recall how he had sustained the laceration\nto his chin, but was certain that it had not happened during the\nstruggle in the vestibule.     Wilson testified that after later\nviewing a video surveillance tape of the incident with one of his\nattorneys, he had come to the realization that his chin had been\ncut when he was kicked in the head by officer Sweet after being\nunshackled from the restraining bar.       Significant aspects of\nWilson’s trial testimony were inconsistent with his deposition\ntestimony and the allegations made in the complaint. Appellees\nclaim that Wilson altered or enlarged his earlier testimony after\nhe realized that it was contradicted by the surveillance tape.\nAlthough rejected by the jury, we recite the gist of Wilson’s trial\ntestimony for its relevance to the issues of the propriety of Chief\nGrady’s counsel’s closing argument and the omitted instruction on\nCrosby’s failure to protect Wilson from Carchedi.\n\n                                 -6-\n\fride, Wilson screamed threats and obscenities and spat at Crosby.\n\nWilson was treated at the hospital for the cut to his chin.10\n\n          B.   Procedural History\n\n          On April 29, 1997, Wilson served notice on the Mendon\n\nBoard of Selectmen of his negligence claims against the officers\n\nand his intent to seek damages from the Town.11 Wilson gave similar\n\nnotice to the Hopedale Board of Selectmen on November 5, 1997.   On\n\nMay 12, 1998, Wilson filed a complaint against the Towns of Mendon\n\nand Hopedale and Mendon officers Crosby, Sergeant Philip Dunlavey,\n\nand Chief Grady.   The complaint also named as defendants Hopedale\nofficers Sweet, Todd Boldy and Mark Boldy, as well as Eugene\n\n\n\n\n     10\n      The hospital record noted no injury to Wilson other than the\nchin laceration.\n     11\n      The Massachusetts Tort Claims Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 258,\n§ 4 (ch. 258), provides in pertinent part that:\n\n     A civil action shall not be instituted against a public\n     employer on a claim for damages under this chapter unless\n     the claimant shall have first presented his claim in\n     writing to the executive officer of such public employer\n     within two years after the date upon which the cause of\n     action arose.\n\n     Presentment is a statutory condition precedent to the bringing\nof a lawsuit against a municipality under the Act. Vasys v. Metro.\nDist. Comm’n, 387 Mass. 51, 55 (1982). The Act is a limited waiver\nof the immunity of the Commonwealth and its political subdivisions\nfrom suit. The practical effect of ch. 258 is to substitute the\ngovernmental employer for the employee as the defendant and to\nrelease the employee from personal liability. The Act immunizes a\nmunicipal employee from liability for acts of ordinary and gross\nnegligence, but not for acts of an intentional nature. Mass. Gen.\nLaws ch. 258, § 10(c).\n\n                                -7-\n\fCostanza, the Hopedale police chief.12             Carchedi and Tagliaferri\n\nwere not named as defendants.\n\n          The complaint, in twenty counts, accused the defendant\nofficers of federal and state civil rights violations.                The chiefs\n\nof police were alleged to have failed to properly train and\n\nsupervise their officers.         Wilson also brought negligent training\nclaims against the Towns, as well as numerous common law claims\n\nagainst the defendant officers, including claims for assault and\n\nbattery, conversion, malicious prosecution, false arrest, false\n\nimprisonment,       abuse   of     process,     negligent    and     intentional\n\ninfliction of emotional distress, invasion of privacy, defamation,\n\nnegligence, and civil conspiracy.\n\n          On    September        21,   1999,    Magistrate   Judge    Swartwood\nbifurcated    the    claims   against     the    named   officers     and   their\n\nsupervisors from the municipal liability claims.               On December 6,\n\n1999, trial commenced on the excessive force claims involving\nCrosby and Sweet, and on the negligent supervision and training\n\nclaims involving Chief Grady.\n\n             During the trial, the court disallowed expert testimony\n\nand denied a request for a special verdict question regarding\n\nCarchedi’s alleged use of excessive force.            The court also refused\n\nto instruct the jury that Crosby could be found liable as a joint\n\n\n     12\n      Summary judgment was granted to the Boldys on October 27,\n1999. Wilson states in his brief that he voluntarily dismissed his\nclaims against the Town of Hopedale prior to trial, although this\nis not borne out by the trial transcript or the relevant docket\nentries. In any event, Wilson does not contend that the verdict\nfor Sweet is not conclusive of his claims against Hopedale.\n\n                                       -8-\n\fventurer with Carchedi or for having failed to intervene to protect\n\nWilson from Carchedi. Wilson duly objected. On December 17, 1999,\n\nthe jury returned a verdict in favor of Crosby, Sweet, and Chief\nGrady.     On December 21, 1999, judgment was entered for the Town of\n\nMendon.     This appeal followed.\n\nII.   DISCUSSION\n\n             A.   Principles of Liability\n\n             A person may recover damages from a state or local\n\nofficial who, while acting under color of state law, commits a\n\nconstitutional tort.      42 U.S.C. § 1983;13 see also Bivens v. Six\n\nUnknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 389\n(1971) (imposing similar liability on federal officers).          The\nexcessive use of force by a police officer against an arrestee is\n\nsuch a tort. See Graham v. O’Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 395-396 & n.10\n\n(1989).     An officer may be held liable not only for his personal\nuse of excessive force, but also for his failure to intervene in\n\nappropriate circumstances to protect an arrestee from the excessive\nuse of force by his fellow officers. Gaudreault v. Municipality of\n\nSalem, 923 F.2d 203, 207 n.3 (1st Cir. 1990).         Liability will\nattach to the municipal employer where its failure to properly\n\n      13\n           42 U.S.C. § 1983 provides that:\n\n      Every person who under color of any statute, ordinance,\n      regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory\n      or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be\n      subjected, any citizen of the United States or other\n      person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation\n      of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the\n      Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party\n      injured in an action at law. . . .\n\n                                    -9-\n\ftrain its officers \"amounts to deliberate indifference to the\n\nrights of persons with whom the police come into contact,\" and\n\nwhere a specific deficiency in training is the \"moving force\"\nbehind a constitutional injury. City of Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S.\n\n378, 388-389, 391 (1989). A supervisory officer may be held liable\n\nfor the behavior of his subordinate officers where his \"action or\ninaction [is] affirmative[ly] link[ed] . . . to that behavior in\n\nthe     sense       that    it     could     be    characterized     as   <supervisory\n\nencouragement, condonation or acquiescence’ or <gross negligence\n\namounting to deliberate indifference.’\"                    Lipsett v. University of\n\nP.R.,    864    F.2d       881,    902     (1st    Cir.   1988)   (internal   citation\n\nomitted). If, however, the officer has inflicted no constitutional\nharm, neither the municipality nor the supervisor can be held\nliable.    City of Los Angeles v. Heller, 475 U.S. 796, 799 (1986)\n\n(per curiam).\n\n               B.    Officer Carchedi\n\n               Wilson’s principal argument on appeal is directed to the\nrefusal of the trial court to permit the jury to consider theories\nof    excessive       force       liability       involving   Carchedi    directly   or\nindirectly.          That Carchedi had sprayed Wilson (and Crosby) with\n\npepper gas during the scuffle in the cellblock was not late-\n\nbreaking news.         Wilson’s April 29, 1997 presentment letter to the\n\nTown of Mendon asserted that Carchedi had \"maced\" him in the face,\n\ncausing him to fall \"face-first to the floor,\" allegations that\n\n\n\n\n                                             -10-\n\fwere repeated in the complaint.14        Carchedi (and Tagliaferri) were,\n\nhowever, portrayed in the presentment letter and complaint as brave\n\nofficers   who   had   come   \"forward    with   the   truth,\"   only    to    be\n\"ridiculed, harassed, ostracized, and silenced\" for their temerity.\n\nNeither Carchedi nor Tagliaferri was named as a defendant in the\n\ncomplaint.\n           As    previously   noted,     Magistrate    Judge   Swartwood      had\n\nbifurcated the individual claims against the defendant officers\n\nfrom Wilson’s claims against the municipal defendants.                  In this\n\nregard, the court was treading a familiar path.           Without a finding\n\nof a constitutional violation on the part of a municipal employee,\n\nthere cannot be a finding of section 1983 damages liability on the\n\npart of the municipality.        Heller, 475 U.S. at 798-99.            Thus, a\ndefendant’s verdict in a bifurcated trial forecloses any further\n\naction against the municipality, resulting in less expense for the\n\nlitigants, and a lighter burden on the court.15          On the other hand,\na verdict against the municipal employee will almost always result\n\nin satisfaction of the judgment by the municipality because of the\n\nindemnification provisions typically found in bargaining agreements\n\nbetween municipalities and their employee unions.\n\n\n\n     14\n      The inconsistency with Wilson’s testimony at trial, where he\nclaimed to have been \"maced\" by Carchedi while lying prone on the\nfloor, was amply exploited by the defense.\n     15\n      In phasing the trial of the case, the court will ordinarily\nphase discovery as well.    Reopening discovery on a plaintiff’s\nmunicipal liability claims remains an option in the unlikely event\nthat the municipality chooses not to satisfy an adverse phase one\njudgment.\n\n                                   -11-\n\f           There is, however, nothing to prevent a plaintiff from\n\nforegoing the naming of an individual officer as a defendant and\n\nproceeding directly to trial against the municipality.            Something\nof the sort happened in Beck v. City of Pittsburgh, 89 F.3d 966,\n\n967 (3d Cir. 1996), where, after bifurcation, the plaintiff’s phase\n\none case   against   the   defendant   officer   ended   in   a   mistrial.\nPlaintiff then dismissed the case against the officer, and was\n\npermitted to proceed against the city on the claim that it had\n\ntolerated a custom and policy of condoning the use of excessive\n\nforce by its officers, among them the original defendant.16\n\n           The added expense aside, the reasons that plaintiffs\n\nalmost never choose to proceed against the municipality directly\n\nare self-evident. The predicate burden of proving a constitutional\nharm on the part of a municipal employee remains an element of the\n\ncase regardless of the route chosen and is much easier to flesh out\n\n\n     16\n       The cases cited by Wilson for the proposition that a section\n1983 action may be prosecuted against a municipality in the absence\nof a named tortfeasor stand for a somewhat different principle, the\nright of a plaintiff to proceed against a \"John Doe\" defendant\nwhose identity can only be established through discovery. This\nprinciple of fairness recognizes that a plaintiff in the heat of a\nconfrontation with police may not know or have the opportunity to\nlearn the identity of the alleged wrongdoer. Once that identity is\ndiscovered, a plaintiff is permitted under the liberal regime of\nRule 15 to substitute the true defendant for the fictitious \"John\nDoe.\" See, e.g., Carmona v. Toledo, 215 F.3d 124, 136 (1st Cir.\n2000) (reversing a district court for refusing to permit such an\namendment); cf. Figueroa v. Rivera, 147 F.3d 77, 83 (1st Cir. 1998)\n(A district court \"is not obligated to <wait indefinitely for [the\nplaintiff] to take steps to identify and serve . . . unknown\ndefendants.’\") (quoting Glaros v. Perse, 628 F.2d 679, 685 (1st\nCir. 1980)). As its caption implies, Bivens was such a \"missing\npersons\" case. See Carol M. Rice, Meet John Doe: It Is Time for\nFederal Civil Procedure to Recognize John Doe Parties, 57 U. Pitt.\nL. Rev. 883, 886-887, 895-897 (1996).\n\n                                 -12-\n\fwhen the tortfeasor is a party amenable to the full powers of\n\ndiscovery.     The burden of placing that harm in the context of a\n\ncausative municipal custom and policy is significantly more onerous\nthan the task of simply proving that an actionable wrong occurred.\n\nAnd finally, an abstract entity like a municipality may present a\n\nmuch less compelling face to a jury than a flesh and blood\ndefendant.\n\n             The counter-argument advanced by appellees rests on the\n\nproposition that a court may \"not permit the adjudication or\n\ndetermination of the rights or liabilities of a person unless that\n\nperson is actually or constructively before it.\"       See, e.g., Brown\n\nv. American Nat. Bank, 197 F.2d 911, 914 (10th Cir. 1952) (\"It is\n\na familiar rule of frequent enunciation that judgment may not be\nentered     with   binding   effect   against   one   not   actually   or\n\nconstructively before the court.\"). From this truism, appellees\n\nextract the falsity that because Wilson failed to name Carchedi as\na defendant, he \"cannot now complain that the court refused to\n\npermit the jury to make a factual determination regarding her\n\nconduct.\"    The reason that this second assertion is wrong is that\n\nWilson was not seeking an adjudication of Carchedi’s rights, nor a\n\njudgment binding on her personally.       Wilson rather was seeking a\n\nfactual finding regarding the implications of Carchedi’s conduct\n\nfor the possible liability of the Town of Mendon as her employer.17\n\n     17\n      This is not meant to be dismissive of appellees’ argument.\nThere is, at first blush, a visceral unease at the idea that a\nperson’s conduct can be the subject of a jury’s condemnation in a\ncase to which the person is not a party. But it is permitted under\nour law. Unindicted co-conspirators are frequently the subject of\n\n                                  -13-\n\fThe issue remains, however, whether Wilson, under the circumstances\n\nof this case, should have been permitted to seek a finding against\n\nCarchedi as a fulcrum to use against the Town of Mendon in a\nsubsequent trial.\n\n          C. The Trial and Its Prequel\n\n          To understand how the issue of Carchedi’s liability came\n\nto be framed as it is on appeal, it is necessary to visit the\n\nrulings on the subject made by the Magistrate Judge as the trial\n\nprogressed, and then to explore the background against which the\n\ncase was tried.\n          The trial began in a state of confusion as to exactly who\n\nand what were to be tried:\n          THE COURT: Now, Mr. Hrones [Wilson’s counsel],\n          my understanding is the individuals that are\n          left in this case are: James Crosby, Dennis\n          Grady, Philip Dunlavey, the Boldys are out,\n          Steven Sweet, and Eugene Costanza?\nHrones replied that the Town of Mendon remained in the case on the\nch. 258 negligence claims, but confessed uncertainty regarding the\n\nindividual defendants.   Hrones stated that his co-counsel, Ms.\nLipede, who had yet to arrive, would make the ultimate decision.\nThe court then asked:\n\n          THE COURT: Have you -- let me put it this way:\n          Have you eliminated any of the causes of\n          action?\n          MR. HRONES: Yes. . . . Do you want to know\n          what’s in the case?\n\n\nadverse jury findings, as are employees whose employers are sued\ndirectly on a theory of respondeat superior for their alleged\ntorts.\n\n                               -14-\n\f         THE COURT: Yeah. Can you give me a list, do\n         you think?\n         MR. HRONES: I don’t know.\n\n         . . .\n\n         MR. HRONES: I’ll tell you what’s in.              The\n         Federal 1983 Claim is in.\n\n         MR. KESTEN [Chief Grady’s counsel]: For what?\n         Mr. HRONES: For everything. I mean, what do\n         you mean for what?     I mean, it’s just in\n         there.    I mean, for illegal arrest, for\n         excessive   use  of   force,  for   malicious\n         prosecution. Those are all in there. We also\n         have the separate common law offense of\n         malicious prosecution. That’s still in there.\n\n         .    .   .\n\n         THE COURT: [H]ere’s how we’re going to do it.\n         I’m not going to press you right now. What\n         you’re going to do is you make an opening and\n         you make an opening on whatever you feel is in\n         the case, okay, and then, obviously, there’s\n         going to be motions to dismiss those which are\n         not in the case or which you don’t even\n         mention.\n\n         Lipede then appeared and stated that the claims against\n\nChief Costanza and Sergeant Dunlavey would not be dropped.              She\n\nalso stated that Wilson had decided to dismiss the invasion of\n\nprivacy and defamation counts, but intended to proceed on all of\n\nhis other common law claims.         Accordingly, Chief Costanza and\n\nSergeant Dunlavey were introduced to the venire as defendants.18\nThen, after   a   lunch   break,   Hrones   announced   that   Wilson   was\n\n\n\n    18\n      Chief Costanza was alleged to have been negligent in his\ntraining and supervision of Sweet. Sergeant Dunlavey was alleged\nto have knowingly approved a false incident report submitted by\nCrosby.\n\n                                   -15-\n\fdismissing all claims against Costanza and Dunlavey, along with\n\nmost of the common law claims against the remaining defendants.19\n\n          At the conclusion of her opening statement, Lipede framed\nthe issues for the jury as follows:\n\n          Ladies and gentlemen, I would ask that you\n          keep an open eye -- an open mind when you\n          review the evidence.    After you review the\n          evidence of the videotape, along with Mr.\n          Wilson’s testimony and even after you hear the\n          testimony of the defendants, you will find\n          that defendant James Crosby, who used pepper\n          spray unnecessarily, should be liable to\n          Richard Wilson for the use of excessive force;\n          you will also find that Steven Sweet from the\n          Town of Hopedale is liable to Richard Wilson\n          for the use of excessive force; and you will\n          find that defendant Dennis Grady, who is the\n          chief of the Mendon Police Department, is\n          liable for failing to properly train defendant\n          James Crosby; and you will also find that the\n          town of Hopedale was negligent in failing to\n          train its officer Steven Sweet for negligence.\n          Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.\n\nWhile Lipede alluded to the second pepper spray incident involving\n\nCarchedi in her narrative of the facts, she did not suggest to the\njury that Wilson was pressing any claim against Carchedi directly,\n\nor by extension, against Crosby based on anything Carchedi had\ndone.\n\n          On the third day of trial, however, Hrones attempted to\n\nelicit an opinion from Melvin Tucker, a use-of-force expert called\n\nby Wilson, as to whether Carchedi’s use of pepper spray during the\n\n\n     19\n      Wilson specifically reserved a conversion claim against\nCrosby and the ch. 258 negligence claims against the Town of\nMendon. Claims under the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act were later\ndisposed of by a stipulation that the jury’s finding on the section\n1983 claims would be conclusive as to the state law claims. The\nconversion claim was dropped on the seventh day of trial.\n\n                               -16-\n\fscuffle in the vestibule was justified.20        The question drew an\n\nimmediate objection, precipitating a lengthy discussion at sidebar.\n\nCrosby’s lawyer (Pfaff) argued that Carchedi\n          is not a defendant in this case, and you are\n          not going to nail the Town on a [section 1983]\n          claim or you are not going to try to get the\n          jury to nail Crosby because Carchedi did\n          something wrong.    Secondly, your theory of\n          negligence in this case does not stem from\n          anything that Kristen Carchedi did, and your\n          258 letter . . . does not indicate at all that\n          Kristen Carchedi was negligent . . . . So you\n          are precluded from getting that claim.\n\n          After    further   discussion,   the   court   sustained   the\n\nobjection.21   The reasons for the judge’s ruling were not initially\n\nclear, but it soon became apparent that he agreed with Pfaff’s\nargument that the failure to assert a claim against Carchedi in the\n\nch. 258 presentment letter also precluded the prosecution of a\n\nclaim against her under section 1983.      The ruling clearly confused\nthe prerequisites of an action under ch. 258 with those of federal\n\nsection 1983.     Section 1983, unlike ch. 258, has no presentment\n\nrequirement.    A section 1983 complaint need only comply with the\n\n     20\n      The answer would have been that it was not. Both Tucker and\nChief Grady’s use-of-force expert, Lt. Daniel Wicks, had reached\nidentical conclusions about Carchedi’s conduct.\n     21\n      The judge stated that he was not excluding testimony about\nthe facts surrounding Carchedi’s use of pepper spray, but only\nopinion testimony about the appropriateness of her actions (and\npotential liability).\n\n     THE COURT: I didn’t say you can’t ask questions. I’m not\n     going to let him give an opinion on it. That’s all. The\n     people talked about Carchedi throughout this whole - -\n     . . . .     I haven’t stopped anyone from asking what\n     happened, what went on. They saw what went on.\n\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\fliberal \"notice pleading\" standards of the Federal Rules.22              See\n\nLeatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence & Coordination\n\nUnit, 507 U.S. 163, 168 (1993); cf. Judge v. City of Lowell, 160\nF.3d 67, 75 & n.10 (1st Cir. 1998).          The allegation in Wilson's\n\ncomplaint,    that   Carchedi   had   \"maced\"   him   in   the   face,   was\n\nsufficient to satisfy this liberal pleading standard.23\n\n             The issue resurfaced in an identical context on the\n\nseventh day of trial, when during the cross-examination of Chief\n\nGrady's use-of-force expert, Lt. Daniel Wicks, Hrones again raised\n\nthe issue of the appropriateness of Carchedi's use of pepper spray.\n\nThis drew an immediate objection.        At sidebar, Kesten      pressed the\n\nnotice issue:\n\n             MR. KESTEN: Judge, we went through this. We\n             went through the presentment letter.     Mr.\n\n     22\n      The seeds of confusion were sown by Pfaff, who insisted that\nthe law governing ch. 258 applied with equal force to section 1983.\nThe principal case cited by Pfaff at side bar was Tambolleo v. Town\nof West Boylston, 34 Mass. App. Ct. 526 (1993), which can be read\nto restrict the scope of a ch. 258 complaint to the precise claims\nidentified in the presentment letter.          But see Martin v.\nCommonwealth, 53 Mass. App. Ct. 526, 529 (2002)(\"[C]lose scrutiny\n[of the cases] discloses that the 'strict compliance' precept is\nconcerned more with whether presentment has been made to the proper\nexecutive officer (proper party noticed) in a timely fashion\n(timeliness) than with the content of the presentment (adequacy of\ncontent).\"). Pfaff then segued from Tambolleo into the section\n1983 claim by arguing that \"to get liability against the Town . .\n. the underlying act done by the individual has got to be liable\nunder 1983. You don't have Kristen Carchedi as a defendant. It's\nthe law.\" At the conclusion of the conference, the judge stated\nthat \"[b]ased on the law primarily as recited by Mr. Pfaff, I am\ngoing to sustain the objection.\" On inquiry from Hrones, the judge\nmade clear that he was sustaining the objection as to both the ch.\n258 negligence claims and the section 1983 excessive force claim.\n     23\n      We may, of course, uphold a correct ruling even if the\nreasons given for it are wrong.    Hope Furnace Assocs., Inc. v.\nFDIC, 71 F.3d 39, 42 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n                                  -18-\n\f           Pfaff gave [you] the cases.   They had every\n           opportunity to put the Town on notice. . . .\n           The law is clear on this. They never said for\n           a moment that Officer Carchedi [had done\n           something wrong] until Mr. Hrones actually\n           called me this summer and said he might amend\n           the complaint, and I said, Go ahead and try\n           it. He didn't do it.\nTo this, Hrones responded:\n\n           MR. HRONES: Let's not confuse two points.\n           We're dealing with 1983, and so I am going to\n           put presentment aside. . . . I don't know why\n           people are hung up on the fact that [Carchedi]\n           was not charged as a defendant.     You simply\n           don't have to do that, your Honor. You can\n           [choose] whoever you want to charge.24\n           . . .\n\n           THE COURT: I've made a ruling on this before,\n           and I'm going to be consistent. I'm going to\n           sustain the objection.\n           At a charging conference the following day, Pfaff asked\n\nthe court for an instruction \"that the jury is not to consider the\nactions of Miss Carchedi for any purposes of liability against any\n\nof the defendants. . . . [A]s I have pointed out before, Carchedi\n\nhas not been named as a defendant here for 1983 purposes, and I\n\nthink Mr. Hrones is still trying to push that point.\"           The court\n\ndeclined to give the requested instruction, but cautioned Hrones\n\nagainst   making   any   argument   about   Carchedi   \"with   respect   to\n\nrecovery in this case.\"     When Hrones objected to the restriction,\n\narguing that Crosby and Carchedi might be found by the jury to have\n\nacted as co-venturers during the second spraying incident, the\n\n\n     24\n      Perhaps to clarify this point, Hrones announced at the next\nday's charging conference that Wilson was waiving his ch. 258\nclaims against the Town of Mendon.\n\n                                    -19-\n\fcourt responded, \"That is my ruling. That's been my ruling.      I've\n\nbeen consistent all the way through on that issue.\"25\n\n          Finally, on the ninth and closing day of trial, the issue\narose as to the extent counsel would be permitted to refer to\n\nCarchedi in closing argument. When the court indicated that it was\n\ninclined to exclude all mention of her, both sides objected,\nreminding the judge that the jury had heard a substantial amount of\n\ntestimony about Carchedi and had seen repeated showings of the\n\nvideotape.     The court relented, stating:\n\n          I'm not going to go through each one of the\n          alleged excessive force [incidents] because\n          it's not for me to find exactly what occurred.\n          It's for the jury to determine what exactly\n          occurred. So consistent with that, my ruling\n          is[,] is that obviously anything that's on the\n          tape is in evidence and can be commented on.\n          There will be no argument to the jury that\n          actions by Officers Tagliaferri and Carchedi\n          were in any way, in any way part of the\n          liability of any of the defendants left in\n          this case. And that's how I'm going to do it.\n\n             What makes this case unusual is that Carchedi was not,\n\ncontrary to expectation, named as a defendant by Wilson.          The\n\nreason Carchedi was not named becomes apparent only on a close\nreading of the trial transcript and the pleadings filed in a\n\nrelated and previously tried case.\n\n             Without delving into unnecessary detail, Richard Wilson's\n\nencounter with Crosby and Carchedi on the night of May 18, 1996,\n\nplayed itself out against a backdrop of parochial police politics.\n\n     25\n      The court then made clear over Hrones' objection that the\nsame reasoning applied to any attempt to argue liability based on\nTagliaferri's conduct.   Wilson has not pursued this ruling on\nappeal.\n\n                                  -20-\n\fThe Mendon Police Department, small as it was, was riven by a\n\nfactional    struggle   over   appointments   to   its   few   full-time\n\npositions.     As it happened, at the time of Wilson's arrest,\nCarchedi and Crosby were pitted against one another as finalists\n\nfor one of those positions.     The selectmen eventually awarded the\n\nappointment to Crosby.     Tagliaferri, who had unsuccessfully vied\nfor another open position, filed a complaint, later joined by\n\nCarchedi, with the EEOC and the MCAD alleging disparate treatment\n\nin the Town's consideration of their candidacies.         In August of\n\n1997, the two women officers, together with Tagliaferri's step-\n\nfather, Martin Auty, a Mendon selectman and police lieutenant,\n\nbrought a lawsuit (the Auty case) against the Town, the police\n\nunion, and most of their departmental colleagues (Chief Grady and\nCrosby among them) alleging, inter alia, espionage, defamation,\n\ngender discrimination, retaliation and invasion of privacy.26 Among\nthe allegations in the complaint was a claim that Carchedi and\nTagliaferri had been unfairly disciplined for suggesting that the\n\nvideotape of the altercation with Wilson had been tampered with as\n\npart of a cover-up.\n\n            In April of 1997, Wilson's criminal case came to trial.\n\nCarchedi and Tagliaferri testified favorably for Wilson, leading to\n\nhis acquittal on all charges.      After Wilson brought the instant\n\n\n\n\n     26\n      The defendants were also alleged to have circulated false\nrumors that Auty was involved in an illicit affair with Carchedi\nand had, as a result, used his position as a selectman to advocate\nher appointment to a permanent position.\n\n                                  -21-\n\fcomplaint, the Auty case went to trial before Magistrate Judge\n\nSwartwood.     The trial went badly for the plaintiffs.\n\n          Two weeks before the jury was seated, Chief Grady, Crosby\nand the Town of Mendon were permitted to amend their answer to the\n\ncomplaint by asserting a counterclaim alleging, inter alia, a civil\n\nconspiracy on the part of Auty, Carchedi and Tagliaferri.               In\nessence, the defendants maintained that the three plaintiffs had\n\nconspired to perjure themselves at Wilson's criminal trial by\n\ntestifying that Wilson had not appeared intoxicated at the time of\n\nhis arrest and that Crosby had used unnecessary force during the\n\nconfrontation in the cellblock.27        The defendants claimed that the\n\ngoal of the conspiracy was to assist Wilson in his civil case as a\n\nmeans of punishing the Town for its failure to give Carchedi a\npermanent position and to retaliate against Crosby for having taken\n\nthe appointment in her stead.\n\n             On March 16, 1999, after a twenty-five day trial, the\njury ruled against plaintiffs on all claims and found for the Town\n\nof Mendon and Crosby on the civil conspiracy counterclaim.             The\njury awarded $25,000 in damages to the Town of Mendon and $5,000 in\n\ndamages   to    Crosby,   which   were    apportioned   among   the   three\n\nplaintiffs.28\n\n\n\n     27\n      Auty, who was not at the station on the night of the\nincident, was alleged to have falsely testified that he had\ninspected the door to Wilson's cell the following day without\nobserving any damage.\n     28\n      The jury also awarded Chief Grady $5,000 in damages against\nAuty on an invasion of privacy claim.\n\n                                   -22-\n\f           Given the jury's finding in the Auty case, Carchedi (and\n\nTagliaferri) were, to put it mildly, \"damaged goods,\" a fact of\n\nwhich all involved in the instant trial, including Magistrate Judge\nSwartwood, were keenly aware.         On the first day of trial, prior to\n\nthe empanelment, the subject of the prior jury verdict arose\n\nobliquely during a discussion of the viability of Wilson's claim of\nmalicious prosecution.\n\n           MR. KESTEN: He has a malicious prosecution\n           claim.   To do that he needs to show he was\n           acquitted. There's a first larger question.\n           If he wants to press it, if he wants to, the\n           defense is that he wasn't acquitted because\n           the prosecution wasn't malicious. He was\n           acquitted because there was a conspiracy from\n           these people to lie for him . . . which was\n           proven. It goes in for that. That's issue\n           preclusion [sic]. That's been proven that the\n           three officers, J. Martin Auty, Kristen\n           [Carchedi], and Sherri Tagliaferri, conspired\n           to lie in the Wilson case.      That was the\n           finding of the jury.\nAfter some      further    discussion,      the   court   ruled    that   \"if   the\n\nmalicious prosecution claim is around and the defendants say that\n\nthe reason why he was acquitted [was] because everybody was in the\n\ntank with him, then I'm going to allow them to explore that.\"                    In\nresponse   to    this     ruling   Hrones    announced,     prior    to   opening\n\nstatements, that the claims of malicious prosecution and false\n\narrest were being dropped.\n\n           Under    the     circumstances,        the   decision    not   to    name\n\nCarchedi as a defendant, or to call her as a witness at trial,\n\ndespite the goading of the defendants to do so, was a predictable\n\nchoice given the near certainty that her presence would have opened\n\nthe door to evidence of the jury's finding in the Auty case.\n\n                                     -23-\n\fWilson's alternate strategy was to concentrate his fire on Crosby\n\nand   Chief    Grady,   a   choice    that   the    defendants   had    clearly\n\nanticipated, and one to which Wilson, after some initial first-day\nconfusion, clearly committed himself.              Only after the trial was\n\nwell underway did Wilson seek to reinject Carchedi into the case.\n\n              We find Wilson's mid-trial switch in strategy troubling\nand ultimately unfair.       What Wilson, through counsel, was seeking\n\nto accomplish was to wield Carchedi as a blunt instrument against\n\nthe Town of Mendon without having the jury exposed to the taint of\n\nthe verdict against her in the Auty case.           Hence, Wilson decided to\n\nomit Carchedi from the case as a defendant and to drop all claims\n\nthat would have permitted the defendants to present evidence, as\n\nthey were prepared to do, that Wilson's criminal acquittal had been\nobtained through Carchedi's perjured testimony.\n\n              As a practical matter, the contours of a trial are often\n\ndefined by the litigating positions taken by the parties' lawyers.\nAt times counsel will, for tactical advantage, seek to try the case\n\non the broadest grounds possible.         Or there may be, as was the case\n\nhere,   sound    reasons    for   drawing    the   issues   to   be    tried   as\n\ncircumspectly as possible.           For Wilson, Carchedi was potentially\n\nthe quintessential elephant in the jury box.                She was no great\n\nbargain for the defendants either, given the finding of their own\n\nexpert that her use of force had been inappropriate.                  Both sides\n\nwent into the trial with every reason to exile Carchedi to the\n\nperiphery of the litigation.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -24-\n\f          In recognition of the realities of the give-and-take of\n\ntrial, appellate courts are reluctant to second-guess the tactical\n\ndecisions of trial counsel for fear of opening a floodgate of\nbuyer's remorse. Thus, it is the rule that a litigant will be held\n\nto the strategic choices made by counsel in all but the most\n\negregious instances. See, e.g., United States v. LaVallee, 448 F.2d\n\n671, 679 (2d Cir. 1971); Leblanc v. I.N.S., 715 F,2d 685, 694 (1st\n\nCir. 1983); see also United States v. One Lot of $25,721.00 in\n\nCurrency, 938 F.2d 1417, 1422 (1st Cir. 1991). Here, the Magistrate\n\nJudge invited Wilson's co-counsel in her opening statement to state\n\nthe specific claims that would be tried. She did so, conspicuously\n\nomitting any claim against Carchedi.   Wilson thus having committed\n\nhimself to that course, we cannot fault the Magistrate Judge for\nenforcing the bargain, even though we may disagree with his stated\n\nreasons for having done so.\n\n          In sum, in principle we agree with Wilson's argument that\nthe failure to name Carchedi was not fatal to his section 1983 case\n\nagainst the Town of Mendon; however, in the circumstances of this\n\ncase, Wilson - having chosen a strategy intended to keep the full\n\ntruth about Carchedi and his own criminal trial from the jury -\n\ncannot now complain of being hoisted on a petard of his own\n\ncontrivance.\n\n          D. Expert Testimony\n\n          Having found no error in the trial court's rejection of\nWilson's request that the jury be asked to make a factual finding\n\nas to whether Carchedi had used excessive force during the second\n\n                                -25-\n\fspraying incident, we conclude that the claim that the court erred\n\nin excluding expert testimony on the subject fails as a matter of\n\ncourse.\n\n           E. Rejected Instructions Concerning Crosby\n\n           Wilson objected to the judge's refusal to instruct on two\n\nalternate theories of liability implicating Crosby, both of which\n\ninvolved Carchedi: (1) that Crosby could be found liable for having\n\nfailed to protect Wilson from Carchedi during the second spraying\n\nincident; or (2) that Crosby could be found liable as a joint\n\ntortfeasor with Carchedi.\n           \"[A]   trial   court's    refusal      to    give   a   particular\n\ninstruction constitutes reversible error only if the requested\ninstruction was (1) correct as a matter of substantive law, (2) not\nsubstantially incorporated into the charge as rendered, and (3)\n\nintegral to an important point in the case.\"               Elliott v. S.D.\n\nWarren Co., 134 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1998) (quoting United States v.\nDeStefano, 59 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1995)).              \"A [litigant] is not\n\nentitled   to   any   specific   words     of   instruction,   but   only   to\ninstructions that properly convey the applicable law of the case.\"\nKinan v. City of Brockton, 876 F.2d 1029, 1037 (1st Cir. 1989)\n\n(quoting Kibbe v. City of Springfield, 777 F.2d 801, 810 (1st Cir.\n1985)).\n           It is settled in this Circuit that an officer may be\n\nliable for failing to intervene in appropriate circumstances to\nprotect a detainee from the excessive use of force by a fellow\n\nofficer.   Gadreault, 923 F.2d at 207 n.3.          However, in Gadreault,\n\n                                    -26-\n\fthis Court found no liability where an attack \"was over in a matter\n\nof   seconds,\"   because   the   defendant   officers   \"did   not   have   a\n\nrealistic opportunity to intercede.\" Davis v. Rennie, 264 F.3d 86,\n98 n.10 (1st Cir. 2001) (discussing Gadreault).          The struggle in\n\nthe cellblock vestibule lasted only a few seconds.             Carchedi was\n\nnot initially involved as a combatant.        She appeared on the scene\nwhile Crosby and Tagliaferri were thrashing about in the effort to\n\nsubdue Wilson.    In these circumstances, even if the jury were to\n\ncredit Wilson's testimony that Carchedi had ordered Crosby to hold\n\nup Wilson's head (the better to spray him), it could not reasonably\n\nfind that Crosby had had an opportunity to reflect on the wisdom of\n\nobeying Carchedi's command.29\n           The request for a \"joint tortfeasor\" instruction fails\nfor a similar reason, although as a preliminary matter, we do not\n\nagree with appellees' argument that \"<joint tortfeasor' liability\n\n\n      29\n       In analogous cases alleging due process violations arising\nout of prison riots, the Supreme Court has contrasted circumstances\nlike those involved in high-speed pursuits in which officers are\nforced to make split-second judgments, where the degree of fault\nmust be extremely high before liability attaches, with those in\nwhich officers have sufficient opportunity to reflect on their\ncourse of action, as in cases involving inmate welfare, where the\ndegree of fault required is correspondingly lower.        County of\nSacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 852-853 (1998) (citing Whitley\nv. Albers, 475 U.S. 312, 320 (1986)). Applying this analysis to\npolice pursuit cases, the Court noted, \"[l]ike prison officials\nfacing a riot, the police on an occasion calling for fast action\nhave obligations that tend to tug against each other. . . . They\nare supposed to act decisively and to show restraint at the same\nmoment, and their decisions have to be made <in haste, under\npressure, and frequently without the luxury of a second chance.'\"\nLewis, 523 U.S. at 853 (citation and internal quotations omitted).\nIn the former type of case, the Court held that liability cannot be\npremised on \"mid-level fault.\" Id. This same general principle\ninforms our analysis in failure to intervene cases.\n\n                                   -27-\n\fdoes not appear to exist under [section] 1983.\"    As we pointed out\n\nin Martinez v. Colon, 54 F.3d 980, 985 n.4 (1st Cir. 1995):\n\n          A constitutional duty to intervene may . . .\n          arise if onlooker officers are instrumental in\n          assisting the actual attacker to place the\n          victim in a vulnerable position. . . .      In\n          such a scenario, the onlooker officers and the\n          aggressor   officer   are  essentially   joint\n          tortfeasors and, therefore, may incur shared\n          constitutional responsibility. See generally\n          Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 187 . . . (1961)\n          (advising courts to read section 1983 against\n          the backdrop of historical tort liability).\n\nHere, however, as in Martinez, there is no evidence to support the\n\nexistence of a joint enterprise between Crosby and Carchedi.\n\nCarchedi, as noted, intervened only after the fray had begun.\n\nWhile there is no requirement that a plaintiff seeking to establish\n\njoint venture liability prove the existence of an anticipatory\ncompact, aiding and abetting liability does require proof that a\n\ndefendant \"associated himself with the venture, participated in it\n\nas something he wished to bring about, and sought by his actions to\nmake it succeed.\"    United States v. Garcia-Rosa, 876 F.2d 209, 217\n\n(1st Cir. 1989).    Mere presence, which is the most that can be said\n\nabout Crosby, does not establish a joint venture. United States v.\n\nHensel, 699 F.2d 18, 36 (1st Cir. 1983).\n\n          The issue for the jury was whether Crosby had used\n\nexcessive force against Wilson at any time during his detention.\n\nThe court properly instructed the jury in this regard:\n\n          Mr. Wilson alleges that Officer Crosby used\n          excessive force against him by spraying him\n          with pepper spray, by pushing him, by forcing\n          him to the floor or into the cell and by\n          kicking or kneeing him. . . . You have viewed\n          the videotape and have listened to the\n\n                                 -28-\n\f            evidence, and it is for you to determine the\n            circumstances of any physical contact between\n            Officer Crosby and Mr. Wilson . . . .\n            (emphasis added).\n\nConsistent   with   this   instruction   the   court    put   two   special\n\nquestions regarding Crosby to the jury.        The first asked whether\nCrosby's use of pepper spray constituted an excessive use of force;\n\nthe second asked whether Crosby had used excessive force against\n\nWilson \"at any other time.\" (Emphasis added).          We see no error.\n\nIII.    DEFENSE COUNSEL'S ARGUMENT\n\n            Finally, Wilson objects to the following comments made by\n\nChief Grady's counsel (Kesten), during closing argument:30\n            Mr. Wilson has been reviewing that tape over\n            and over again beginning with Attorney Strand\n            over there, and they made up a story. . . .\n            And their claim is -- and you heard that after\n            viewing this video and meeting with Attorney\n            Strand, a letter was written by Attorney\n            Strand [in] which they came up with the\n            phantom prey.    They came up with lots of\n            stories. None of it happened.31\n\n\n       30\n      Appellees argue that Wilson waived this ground of appeal by\nfailing to object at the time the offending comment was made. We\nare loath to impose a rule that would require counsel to abandon\nprofessionalism and decorum by routinely interrupting the other\nside's closing argument to avoid the risk of waiving an objection\nentirely.   Absent the most egregious circumstances, attorneys\nshould, and generally do, wait until the conclusion of an\nopponent's argument to voice such objections. See, e.g., Computer\nSyst. Eng'g v. Qantel Corp., 740 F.2d 59, 69 (1st Cir. 1984)\n(finding counsel's objections to improper closing argument untimely\nwhere the attorney had the opportunity but failed to raise\nobjections outside the presence of the jury, at the time of\nargument, and at a sidebar conference immediately following the\nargument).\n       31\n      Wilson's rendition of the transcript substitutes \"phantom\nspray\" for \"phantom prey,\" an allusion to Carchedi's involvement in\nthe second pepper spraying incident. It is clear from the context\nof the remark, however, that the reference was to Sweet as a\n\n                                 -29-\n\f          While the insinuation that Wilson had concocted \"stories\"\n\nwith the connivance of his lawyer should not have been made, the\n\npoint that Wilson had no independent recollection of how he had\ncome to suffer a laceration to his chin was invited by his own\n\ntestimony.\n\n          Q.      Isn't it a fact, sir, that you came\n                  to the conclusion that Officer Sweet\n                  had kicked your head only when Mr.\n                  Strand told you that that had\n                  happened?\n\n             A.      We viewed the videotape, yes.\n\n             Q.      Is that a no, sir, or yes?\n\n             A.      Yes.   When we viewed the videotape.\n\n             . . .\n\n             Q.      Page 158, Line 3, at that same\n                     deposition, sir, were you asked the\n                     following question and did you give\n                     the following response:\n                     \"QUESTION: Was it the first time you\n                     watched the videotape with your\n                     lawyer that you understood in your\n                     mind that it was a Hopedale officer\n                     that had cut your chin?\n\n                     \"ANSWER: When Bob point[ed] it out,\n                     yes.\"\n\n             A.      Yes.\n\n             Q.      And Bob is Mr. Strand, Correct?\n\n             A.      Yes, sir.   I already said that, yes.\n\n             Wilson's credibility was the pivotal issue at trial, and\n\nhis memory of events was a fair subject for comment.         There was no\n\n\n\n\"phantom\" defendant, \"the Admiral Stockdale of this case,\" who,\naccording to Kesten, should never have been named in the lawsuit.\n\n                                      -30-\n\fbasis, however, for the insinuation that attorney Strand had\n\nincited Wilson to perjury. But in context the comment was fleeting\n\nand, given the trial theatrics in which counsel for both sides\nengaged, would likely have been recognized by the jury as yet\n\nanother   display   of    barristerial      excess.       Moreover,   we    are\n\nconfident, that if there was any prejudice, it was cured by the\ncourt's admonition       to   the   jury,   both   in   its   preliminary   and\n\nconcluding instructions, that the lawyers' statements and arguments\n\nwere not to be considered as evidence.                  See Brandt v. Wand\n\nPartners, 242 F.3d 6, 23 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n          Because we find no reversible error, the judgment of the\n\ndistrict court is affirmed.         No costs are awarded.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -31-\n\f",

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Relevant Facts</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recite the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict. <i>Ferragamo v. Chubb Life Ins. Co.,</i> 94 F.3d 26, 27 n. 1 (1st Cir.1996). On May 18, 1996, officer James Crosby, while on patrol on North Street in Mendon, Massachusetts, observed a green convertible stray across the double yellow median line and then drift back to the shoulder of the road, narrowly missing a parked vehicle. Crosby activated his auxiliary lights and signaled the car to stop. On approaching the driver's side of the car, Crosby detected a mild odor of alcohol. Crosby observed a passenger, Nancy Wilson, lying face down with her head wedged between the convertible's front bucket seats. When Crosby asked the driver, Richard Wilson, whether his female passenger was all right, he replied, \"she's f'in cocked.\" Crosby summoned officer Kristen Carchedi to the scene to attend to Nancy Wilson. Officer Sherri Tagliaferri also responded to the call, and assisted Carchedi and Crosby in taking Nancy Wilson into protective custody.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At Crosby's request, Richard Wilson produced a valid driver's license but was unable to locate the vehicle's registration papers. Suspecting that Wilson might be intoxicated, Crosby directed him to perform several field sobriety tests. The results were sufficiently suggestive to cause Crosby to place Wilson under arrest for operating under the influence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Upon being placed in the rear compartment of Crosby's cruiser, Wilson began screaming epithets and slamming his body against the back of the seat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the station, while Crosby was completing booking formalities, Wilson again became belligerent. Crosby escorted him to a cell. Once inside, Wilson began to kick at the cell door. Crosby ordered Wilson to stop. When Wilson persisted in kicking at the door, Crosby ordered him to step out of the cell.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Wilson refused to comply. Officer Tagliaferri then attempted to flush Wilson from the cell by spraying him with pepper gas.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Unable to find her target, Tagliaferri gave the gas cannister to Crosby, who after several attempts, succeeded in squirting the gas in Wilson's face. Wilson responded with a tirade of threats and obscenities. Alarmed by the ferocity of Wilson's outburst, Crosby asked that reinforcements be summoned from the neighboring Town of Hopedale.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wilson in the meantime succeeded in kicking open the door of the cell. He then rushed into the vestibule of the cellblock with Crosby and Tagliaferri in hot pursuit. Crosby leapt on Wilson's back while Tagliaferri grabbed Wilson's feet. Wilson and the officers tumbled to the floor where the scrimmage continued. Carchedi, who was not present when the struggle began, suddenly appeared, and from a crouching position let loose a spray of pepper gas, hitting Wilson and Crosby in the face.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Crosby and Tagliaferri eventually succeeded in manacling Wilson's legs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At some point during the struggle, Wilson suffered a cut to his chin, prompting Crosby to request that an ambulance be called.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> While waiting for the ambulance, Crosby handcuffed Wilson to a restraining rail, after which Wilson spat at him. Once the ambulance arrived, Crosby unshackled Wilson from the rail, and placed him prone on the floor. Officer Sweet, who was assisting Crosby, restrained Wilson by placing his foot on Wilson's back. Wilson was taken, still manacled, by stretcher to the ambulance. Crosby accompanied Wilson to the hospital. During the ambulance ride, Wilson screamed threats and obscenities and spat at Crosby. Wilson was treated at the hospital for the cut to his chin.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Procedural History</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 29, 1997, Wilson served notice on the Mendon Board of Selectmen of his negligence claims against the officers and his intent to seek damages from the Town.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Wilson gave similar notice to the Hopedale Board of Selectmen on November 5, 1997. On May 12, 1998, Wilson filed a complaint against the Towns of Mendon and Hopedale and Mendon officers Crosby, Sergeant Philip Dunlavey, and Chief Grady. The complaint also named as defendants Hopedale officers Sweet, Todd Boldy and Mark Boldy, as well as Eugene Costanza, the Hopedale police chief.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Carchedi and Tagliaferri were not named as defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint, in twenty counts, accused the defendant officers of federal and state civil rights violations. The chiefs of police were alleged to have failed to properly train and supervise their officers. Wilson also brought negligent training claims against the Towns, as well as numerous common law claims against the defendant officers, including claims for assault and battery, conversion, malicious prosecution, false arrest, false imprisonment, abuse of process, negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress, invasion of privacy, defamation, negligence, and civil conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 21, 1999, Magistrate Judge Swartwood bifurcated the claims against the named officers and their supervisors from the municipal liability claims. On December 6, 1999, trial commenced on the excessive force claims involving Crosby and Sweet, and on the negligent supervision and training claims involving Chief Grady.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the trial, the court disallowed expert testimony and denied a request for a special verdict question regarding Carchedi's alleged use of excessive force. The court also refused to instruct the jury that Crosby could be found liable as a joint venturer with Carchedi or for having failed to intervene to protect Wilson from Carchedi. Wilson duly objected. On December 17, 1999, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Crosby, Sweet, and Chief Grady. On December 21, 1999, judgment was entered for the Town of Mendon. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Principles of Liability</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A person may recover damages from a state or local official who, while acting under color of state law, commits a constitutional tort. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> <i>see also Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics,</i> 403 U.S. 388, 389, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971) (imposing similar liability on federal officers). The excessive use of force by a police officer against an arrestee is such a tort. <i>See Graham v. Connor,</i> 490 U.S. 386, 395-396 &amp; n. 10, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989). An officer may be held liable not only for his personal use of excessive force, but also for his failure to intervene in appropriate circumstances to protect an arrestee from the excessive use of force by his fellow officers. <i>Gaudreault v. Municipality of Salem,</i> 923 F.2d 203, 207 n. 3 (1st Cir.1990). Liability will attach to the municipal employer where its failure to properly train its officers \"amounts to deliberate indifference to the rights of persons with whom the police come into contact,\" and where a specific deficiency in training is the \"moving force\" behind a constitutional injury. <i>City of Canton v. Harris,</i> 489 U.S. 378, 388-389, 391, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 103 L.Ed.2d 412 (1989). A supervisory officer may be held liable for the behavior of his subordinate officers where his \"action or inaction [is] affirmative[ly] link[ed] ... to that behavior in the sense that it could be characterized as `supervisory encouragement, condonation or acquiescence' <i>or</i> `gross negligence amounting to deliberate indifference.'\" <i>Lipsett v. University of P.R.,</i> 864 F.2d 881, 902 (1st Cir.1988) (internal citation omitted). If, however, the officer has inflicted no constitutional harm, neither the municipality nor the supervisor can be held liable. <i>City of Los Angeles v. Heller,</i> 475 U.S. 796, 799, 106 S.Ct. 1571, 89 L.Ed.2d 806 (1986) (per curiam).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Officer Carchedi</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wilson's principal argument on appeal is directed to the refusal of the trial court to permit the jury to consider theories of excessive force liability involving Carchedi directly or indirectly. That Carchedi had sprayed Wilson (and Crosby) with pepper gas during the scuffle in the cellblock was not late-breaking news. Wilson's April 29, 1997 presentment letter to the Town of Mendon asserted that Carchedi had \"maced\" him in the face, causing him to fall \"face-first to the floor,\" allegations that were repeated in the complaint.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> Carchedi (and Tagliaferri) were, however, portrayed in the presentment letter and complaint as brave officers who had come \"forward with the truth,\" only to be \"ridiculed, harassed, ostracized, and silenced\" for their temerity. Neither Carchedi nor Tagliaferri was named as a defendant in the complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As previously noted, Magistrate Judge Swartwood had bifurcated the individual claims against the defendant officers from Wilson's claims against the municipal defendants. In this regard, the court was treading a familiar path. Without a finding of a constitutional violation on the part of a municipal employee, there cannot be a finding of section 1983 damages liability on the part of the municipality. <i>Heller,</i> 475 U.S. at 798-99, 106 S.Ct. 1571. Thus, a defendant's verdict in a bifurcated trial forecloses any further action against the municipality, resulting in less expense for the litigants, and a lighter burden on the court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> On the other hand, a verdict against the municipal employee will almost always result in satisfaction of the judgment by the municipality because of the indemnification provisions typically found in bargaining agreements between municipalities and their employee unions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is, however, nothing to prevent a plaintiff from foregoing the naming of an individual officer as a defendant and proceeding directly to trial against the municipality. Something of the sort happened in <i>Beck v. City of Pittsburgh,</i> 89 F.3d 966, 967 (3d Cir.1996), where, after bifurcation, the plaintiff's phase one case against the defendant officer ended in a mistrial. Plaintiff then dismissed the case against the officer, and was permitted to proceed against the city on the claim that it had tolerated a custom and policy of condoning the use of excessive force by its officers, among them the original defendant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The added expense aside, the reasons that plaintiffs almost never choose to proceed against the municipality directly are self-evident. The predicate burden of proving a constitutional harm on the part of a municipal employee remains an element of the case regardless of the route chosen and is much easier to flesh out when the tortfeasor is a party amenable to the full powers of discovery. The burden of placing that harm in the context of a causative municipal custom and policy is significantly more onerous than the task of simply proving that an actionable wrong occurred. And finally, an abstract entity like a municipality may present a much less compelling face to a jury than a flesh and blood defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The counter-argument advanced by appellees rests on the proposition that a court may \"not permit the adjudication or determination of the rights or liabilities of a person unless that person is actually or constructively before it.\" <i>See, e.g., Brown v. American Nat. Bank,</i> 197 F.2d 911, 914 (10th Cir.1952) (\"It is a familiar rule of frequent enunciation that judgment may not be entered with binding effect against one not actually or constructively before the court.\"). From this truism, appellees extract the falsity that because Wilson failed to name Carchedi as a defendant, he \"cannot now complain that the court refused to permit the jury to make a factual determination regarding her conduct.\" The reason that this second assertion is wrong is that Wilson was not seeking an adjudication of Carchedi's rights, nor a judgment binding on her personally. Wilson rather was seeking a factual finding regarding the implications of Carchedi's conduct for the possible liability of the Town of Mendon as her employer.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> The issue remains, however, whether Wilson, under the circumstances of this case, should have been permitted to seek a finding against Carchedi as a fulcrum to use against the Town of Mendon in a subsequent trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>The Trial and Its Prequel</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To understand how the issue of Carchedi's liability came to be framed as it is on appeal, it is necessary to visit the rulings on the subject made by the Magistrate Judge as the trial progressed, and then to explore the background against which the case was tried.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial began in a state of confusion as to exactly who and what were to be tried:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT: Now, Mr. Hrones [Wilson's counsel], my understanding is the individuals that are left in this case are: James Crosby, Dennis Grady, Philip Dunlavey, the Boldys are out, Steven Sweet, and Eugene Costanza?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hrones replied that the Town of Mendon remained in the case on the ch. 258 negligence claims, but confessed uncertainty regarding the individual defendants. Hrones stated that his co-counsel, Ms. Lipede, who had yet to arrive, would make the ultimate decision. The court then asked: THE COURT: Have you &#8212; let me put it this way: Have you eliminated any of the causes of action?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR.

I mean, what do you mean for what? I mean, it's just in there. I mean, for illegal arrest, for excessive use of force, for malicious prosecution. Those are all in there. We also have the separate common law offense of malicious prosecution. That's still in there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT: [H]ere's how we're going to do it. I'm not going to press you right now. What you're going to do is you make an opening and you make an opening on whatever you feel is in the case, okay, and then, obviously, there's going to be motions to dismiss those which are not in the case or which you don't even mention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lipede then appeared and stated that the claims against Chief Costanza and Sergeant Dunlavey would not be dropped. She also stated that Wilson had decided to dismiss the invasion of privacy and defamation counts, but intended to proceed on all of his other common law claims. Accordingly, Chief Costanza and Sergeant Dunlavey were introduced to the venire as defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> Then, after a lunch break, Hrones announced that Wilson was dismissing all claims against Costanza and Dunlavey, along with most of the common law claims against the remaining defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the conclusion of her opening statement, Lipede framed the issues for the jury as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ladies and gentlemen, I would ask that you keep an open eye &#8212; an open mind when you review the evidence. After you review the evidence of the video-tape, along with Mr. Wilson's testimony and even after you hear the testimony of the defendants, you will find that defendant James Crosby, who used pepper spray unnecessarily, should be liable to Richard Wilson for the use of excessive force; you will also find that Steven Sweet from the Town of Hopedale is liable to Richard Wilson for the use of excessive force; and you will find that defendant Dennis Grady, who is the chief of the Mendon Police Department, is liable for failing to properly train defendant James Crosby; and you will also find that the town of Hopedale was negligent in failing to train its officer Steven Sweet for negligence. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Lipede alluded to the second pepper spray incident involving Carchedi in her narrative of the facts, she did not suggest to the jury that Wilson was pressing any claim against Carchedi directly, or by extension, against Crosby based on anything Carchedi had done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the third day of trial, however, Hrones attempted to elicit an opinion from Melvin Tucker, a use-of-force expert called by Wilson, as to whether Carchedi's use of pepper spray during the scuffle in the vestibule was justified.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> The question drew an immediate objection, precipitating a lengthy discussion at sidebar. Crosby's lawyer (Pfaff) argued that Carchedi</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">is not a defendant in this case, and you are not going to nail the Town on a [section 1983] claim or you are not going to try to get the jury to nail Crosby because Carchedi did something wrong. Secondly, your theory of negligence in this case does not stem from anything that Kristen Carchedi did, and your 258 letter ... does not indicate at all that Kristen Carchedi was negligent.... So you are precluded from getting that claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After further discussion, the court sustained the objection.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> The reasons for the judge's ruling were not initially clear, but it soon became apparent that he agreed with Pfaff's argument that the failure to assert a claim against Carchedi in the ch. 258 presentment letter also precluded the prosecution of a claim against her under section 1983. The ruling clearly confused the prerequisites of an action under ch. 258 with those of federal section 1983. Section 1983, unlike ch. 258, has no presentment requirement. A section 1983 complaint need only comply with the liberal \"notice pleading\" standards of the Federal Rules.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a> <i>See Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence &amp; Coordination Unit,</i> 507 U.S. 163, 168, 113 S.Ct. 1160, 122 L.Ed.2d 517 (1993); <i>cf. Judge v. City of Lowell,</i> 160 F.3d 67, 75 &amp; n. 10 (1st Cir.1998). The allegation in Wilson's complaint, that Carchedi had \"maced\" him in the face, was sufficient to satisfy this liberal pleading standard.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue resurfaced in an identical context on the seventh day of trial, when during the cross-examination of Chief Grady's use-of-force expert, Lt. Daniel Wicks, Hrones again raised the issue of the appropriateness of Carchedi's use of pepper spray. This drew an immediate objection. At sidebar, Kesten pressed the notice issue:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR. KESTEN: Judge, we went through this. We went through the presentment letter. Mr. Pfaff gave [you] the cases. They had every opportunity to put the Town on notice.... The law is clear on this. They never said for a moment that Officer Carchedi [had done something wrong] until Mr. Hrones actually called me this summer and said he might amend the complaint, and I said, Go ahead and try it. He didn't do it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">To this, Hrones responded:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR. HRONES: Let's not confuse two points. We're dealing with 1983, and so I am going to put presentment aside.... I don't know why people are hung up on the fact that [Carchedi] was not charged as a defendant. You simply don't have to do that, your Honor. You can [choose] whoever you want to charge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT: I've made a ruling on this before, and I'm going to be consistent. I'm going to sustain the objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a charging conference the following day, Pfaff asked the court for an instruction \"that the jury is not to consider the actions of Miss Carchedi for any purposes of liability against any of the defendants.... [A]s I have pointed out before, Carchedi has not been named as a defendant here for 1983 purposes, and I think Mr. Hrones is still trying to push that point.\" The court declined to give the requested instruction, but cautioned Hrones against making any argument about Carchedi \"with respect to recovery in this case.\" When Hrones objected to the restriction, arguing that Crosby and Carchedi might be found by the jury to have acted as co-venturers during the second spraying incident, the court responded, \"That is my ruling. That's been my ruling. I've been consistent all the way through on that issue.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, on the ninth and closing day of trial, the issue arose as to the extent counsel would be permitted to refer to Carchedi in closing argument. When the court indicated that it was inclined to exclude all mention of her, both sides objected, reminding the judge that the jury had heard a substantial amount of testimony about Carchedi and had seen repeated showings of the videotape. The court relented, stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I'm not going to go through each one of the alleged excessive force [incidents] because it's not for me to find exactly what occurred. It's for the jury to determine what exactly occurred. So consistent with that, my ruling is[,] is that obviously anything that's on the tape is in evidence and can be commented on. There will be no argument to the jury that actions by Officers Tagliaferri and Carchedi were in any way, in any way part of the liability of any of the defendants left in this case. And that's how I'm going to do it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What makes this case unusual is that Carchedi was not, contrary to expectation, named as a defendant by Wilson. The reason Carchedi was not named becomes apparent only on a close reading of the trial transcript and the pleadings filed in a related and previously tried case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without delving into unnecessary detail, Richard Wilson's encounter with Crosby and Carchedi on the night of May 18, 1996, played itself out against a backdrop of parochial police politics. The Mendon Police Department, small as it was, was riven by a factional struggle over appointments to its few full-time positions. As it happened, at the time of Wilson's arrest, Carchedi and Crosby were pitted against one another as finalists for one of those positions. The selectmen eventually awarded the appointment to Crosby. Tagliaferri, who had unsuccessfully vied for another open position, filed a complaint, later joined by Carchedi, with the EEOC and the MCAD alleging disparate treatment in the Town's consideration of their candidacies. In August of 1997, the two women officers, together with Tagliaferri's step-father, Martin Auty, a Mendon selectman and police lieutenant, brought a lawsuit (the Auty case) against the Town, the police union, and most of their departmental colleagues (Chief Grady and Crosby among them) alleging, <i>inter alia,</i> espionage, defamation, gender discrimination, retaliation and invasion of privacy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a> Among the allegations in the complaint was a claim that Carchedi and Tagliaferri had been unfairly disciplined for suggesting that the videotape of the altercation with Wilson had been tampered with as part of a cover-up.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April of 1997, Wilson's criminal case came to trial. Carchedi and Tagliaferri testified favorably for Wilson, leading to his acquittal on all charges. After Wilson brought the instant complaint, the Auty case went to trial before Magistrate Judge Swartwood. The trial went badly for the plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two weeks before the jury was seated, Chief Grady, Crosby and the Town of Mendon were permitted to amend their answer to the complaint by asserting a counterclaim alleging, <i>inter alia,</i> a civil conspiracy on the part of Auty, Carchedi and Tagliaferri. In essence, the defendants maintained that the three plaintiffs had conspired to perjure themselves at Wilson's criminal trial by testifying that Wilson had not appeared intoxicated at the time of his arrest and that Crosby had used unnecessary force during the confrontation in the cellblock.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a> The defendants claimed that the goal of the conspiracy was to assist Wilson in his civil case as a means of punishing the Town for its failure to give Carchedi a permanent position and to retaliate against Crosby for having taken the appointment in her stead.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 16, 1999, after a twenty-five day trial, the jury ruled against plaintiffs on all claims and found for the Town of Mendon and Crosby on the civil conspiracy counterclaim. The jury awarded $25,000 in damages to the Town of Mendon and $5,000 in damages to Crosby, which were apportioned among the three plaintiffs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the jury's finding in the Auty case, Carchedi (and Tagliaferri) were, to put it mildly, \"damaged goods,\" a fact of which all involved in the instant trial, including Magistrate Judge Swartwood, were keenly aware. On the first day of trial, prior to the empanelment, the subject of the prior jury verdict arose obliquely during a discussion of the viability of Wilson's claim of malicious prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR. KESTEN: He has a malicious prosecution claim. To do that he needs to show he was acquitted. There's a first larger question. If he wants to press it, if he wants to, the defense is that he wasn't acquitted because the prosecution wasn't malicious. He was acquitted because there was a conspiracy from these people to lie for him ... which was proven. It goes in for that. That's issue preclusion [sic]. That's been proven that the three officers, J. Martin Auty, Kristen [Carchedi], and Sherri Tagliaferri, conspired to lie in the Wilson case. That was the finding of the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After some further discussion, the court ruled that \"if the malicious prosecution claim is around and the defendants say that the reason why he was acquitted [was] because everybody was in the tank with him, then I'm going to allow them to explore that.\" In response to this ruling Hrones announced, prior to opening statements, that the claims of malicious prosecution and false arrest were being dropped.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the circumstances, the decision not to name Carchedi as a defendant, or to call her as a witness at trial, despite the goading of the defendants to do so, was a predictable choice given the near certainty that her presence would have opened the door to evidence of the jury's finding in the Auty case. Wilson's alternate strategy was to concentrate his fire on Crosby and Chief Grady, a choice that the defendants had clearly anticipated, and one to which Wilson, after some initial first-day confusion, clearly committed himself. Only after the trial was well underway did Wilson seek to reinject Carchedi into the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find Wilson's mid-trial switch in strategy troubling and ultimately unfair. What Wilson, through counsel, was seeking to accomplish was to wield Carchedi as a blunt instrument against the Town of Mendon without having the jury exposed to the taint of the verdict against her in the Auty case. Hence, Wilson decided to omit Carchedi from the case as a defendant and to drop all claims that would have permitted the defendants to present evidence, as they were prepared to do, that Wilson's criminal acquittal had been obtained through Carchedi's perjured testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a practical matter, the contours of a trial are often defined by the litigating positions taken by the parties' lawyers. At times counsel will, for tactical advantage, seek to try the case on the broadest grounds possible. Or there may be, as was the case here, sound reasons for drawing the issues to be tried as circumspectly as possible. For Wilson, Carchedi was potentially the quintessential elephant in the jury box. She was no great bargain for the defendants either, given the finding of their own expert that her use of force had been inappropriate. Both sides went into the trial with every reason to exile Carchedi to the periphery of the litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In recognition of the realities of the give-and-take of trial, appellate courts are reluctant to second-guess the tactical decisions of trial counsel for fear of opening a floodgate of buyer's remorse. Thus, it is the rule that a litigant will be held to the strategic choices made by counsel in all but the most egregious instances. <i>See, e.g., United States v. LaVallee,</i> 448 F.2d 671, 679 (2d Cir.1971); <i>Leblanc v. I.N.S.,</i> 715 F.2d 685, 694 (1st Cir.1983); <i>see also United States v. One Lot of $25,721.00 in Currency,</i> 938 F.2d 1417, 1422 (1st Cir. 1991). Here, the Magistrate Judge invited Wilson's co-counsel in her opening statement to state the specific claims that would be tried. She did so, conspicuously omitting any claim against Carchedi. Wilson thus having committed himself to that course, we cannot fault the Magistrate Judge for enforcing the bargain, even though we may disagree with his stated reasons for having done so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, in principle we agree with Wilson's argument that the failure to name Carchedi was not fatal to his section 1983 case against the Town of Mendon; however, in the circumstances of this case, Wilson &#8212; having chosen a strategy intended to keep the full truth about Carchedi and his own criminal trial from the jury &#8212; cannot now complain of being hoisted on a petard of his own contrivance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. <i>Expert Testimony</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having found no error in the trial court's rejection of Wilson's request that the jury be asked to make a factual finding as to whether Carchedi had used excessive force during the second spraying incident, we conclude that the claim that the court erred in excluding expert testimony on the subject fails as a matter of course.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. <i>Rejected Instructions Concerning Crosby</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wilson objected to the judge's refusal to instruct on two alternate theories of liability implicating Crosby, both of which involved Carchedi: (1) that Crosby could be found liable for having failed to protect Wilson from Carchedi during the second spraying incident; or (2) that Crosby could be found liable as a joint tortfeasor with Carchedi.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[A] trial court's refusal to give a particular instruction constitutes reversible error only if the requested instruction was (1) correct as a matter of substantive law, (2) not substantially incorporated into the charge as rendered, and (3) integral to an important point in the case.\" <i>Elliott v.

However, in <i>Gaudreault,</i> this Court found no liability where an attack \"was over in a matter of seconds,\" because the defendant officers \"did not have a realistic opportunity to intercede.\" <i>Davis v. Rennie,</i> 264 F.3d 86, 98 n. 10 (1st Cir.2001) (discussing <i>Gaudreault</i>). The struggle in the cellblock vestibule lasted only a few seconds. Carchedi was not initially involved as a combatant. She appeared on the scene while Crosby and Tagliaferri were thrashing about in the effort to subdue Wilson. In these circumstances, even if the jury were to credit Wilson's testimony that Carchedi had ordered Crosby to hold up Wilson's head (the better to spray him), it could not reasonably find that Crosby had an opportunity to reflect on the wisdom of obeying Carchedi's command.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The request for a \"joint tortfeasor\" instruction fails for a similar reason, although as a preliminary matter, we do not agree with appellees' argument that \"`joint tortfeasor' liability does not appear to exist under [section] 1983.\" As we pointed out in <i>Martinez v. Colon,</i> 54 F.3d 980, 985 n. 4 (1st Cir.1995):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A constitutional duty to intervene may... arise if onlooker officers are instrumental in assisting the actual attacker to place the victim in a vulnerable position.... In such a scenario, the onlooker officers and the aggressor officer are essentially joint tortfeasors and, therefore, may incur shared constitutional responsibility. <i>See generally Monroe v. Pape,</i> 365 U.S. 167, 187, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961) (advising courts to read section 1983 against the backdrop of historical tort liability).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, as in <i>Martinez,</i> there is no evidence to support the existence of a joint enterprise between Crosby and Carchedi. Carchedi, as noted, intervened only after the fray had begun. While there is no requirement that a plaintiff seeking to establish joint venture liability prove the existence of an anticipatory compact, aiding and abetting liability does require proof that a defendant \"associated himself with the venture, participated in it as something he wished to bring about, and sought by his actions to make it succeed.\" <i>United States v. Garcia-Rosa,</i> 876 F.2d 209, 217 (1st Cir.1989). Mere presence, which is the most that can be said about Crosby, does not establish a joint venture. <i>United States v. Hensel,</i> 699 F.2d 18, 36 (1st Cir. 1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue for the jury was whether Crosby had used excessive force against Wilson at any time during his detention. The court properly instructed the jury in this regard:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Wilson alleges that Officer Crosby used excessive force against him by spraying him with pepper spray, by pushing him, by forcing him to the floor or into the cell and by kicking or kneeing him.... You have viewed the videotape and have listened to the evidence, and it is for you to determine the circumstances of <i>any</i> physical contact between Officer Crosby and Mr. Wilson.... (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consistent with this instruction the court put two special questions regarding Crosby to the jury. The first asked whether Crosby's use of pepper spray constituted an excessive use of force; the second asked whether Crosby had used excessive force against Wilson \"<i>at any other time.</i>\" (Emphasis added). We see no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. DEFENSE COUNSEL'S ARGUMENT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Wilson objects to the following comments made by Chief Grady's counsel (Kesten), during closing argument:<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Wilson has been reviewing that tape over and over again beginning with Attorney Strand over there, and they made up a story....

There was no basis, however, for the insinuation that attorney Strand had incited Wilson to perjury. But in context the comment was fleeting and, given the trial theatrics in which counsel for both sides engaged, would likely have been recognized by the jury as yet another display of barristerial excess. Moreover, we are confident, that if there was any prejudice, it was cured by the court's admonition to the jury, both in its preliminary and concluding instructions, that the lawyers' statements and arguments were not to be considered as evidence. <i>See Brandt v.

According to Wilson, he began voluntarily walking towards the cell after Crosby refused him permission to make a telephone call to his uncle, a police detective in a neighboring town. Enraged, Crosby shoved Wilson against a wall, knocked him to the ground, and dragged him into the cell with his hands cuffed behind his back. Once in the cell, Crosby kneed Wilson in the ribs and punched him several times. Wilson admitted to shouting obscenities and kicking at the cell door in response to Crosby's taunts, but claimed to have regained his composure when Crosby, without warning, opened the cell door and sprayed several jets of pepper gas, striking Wilson in the face on the third attempt. Crosby threw Wilson against the wall before leaving the cell. Wilson succeeded in kicking the cell door open to escape from the fumes. He then ran into the vestibule searching for Nancy Wilson. Crosby jumped him from behind, while Tagliaferri tackled his legs. Wilson testified that after he was wrestled to the floor, Carchedi ordered Crosby to lift his [Wilson's] head so that she could spray him in \"the f'in face.\" Crosby wrenched Wilson's head back while Carchedi sprayed both men in the face. Wilson stated that he could not recall how he had sustained the laceration to his chin, but was certain that it had not happened during the struggle in the vestibule. Wilson testified that after later viewing a video surveillance tape of the incident with one of his attorneys, he had come to the realization that his chin had been cut when he was kicked in the head by officer Sweet after being unshackled from the restraining bar. Significant aspects of Wilson's trial testimony were inconsistent with his deposition testimony and the allegations made in the complaint. Appellees claim that Wilson altered or enlarged his earlier testimony after he realized that it was contradicted by the surveillance tape. Although rejected by the jury, we recite the gist of Wilson's trial testimony for its relevance to the issues of the propriety of Chief Grady's counsel's closing argument and the omitted instruction on Crosby's failure to protect Wilson from Carchedi</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> The hospital record noted no injury to Wilson other than the chin laceration</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> The Massachusetts Tort Claims Act, Mass.

Once that identity is discovered, a plaintiff is permitted under the liberal regime of Rule 15 to substitute the true defendant for the fictitious \"John Doe.\"<i>See, e.g., Carmona v.

The principal case cited by Pfaff at side bar was<i>Tambolleo v. Town of West Boylston,</i> 34 Mass. App.Ct. 526, 613 N.E.2d 127 (1993), which can be read to restrict the scope of a ch. 258 complaint to the precise claims identified in the presentment letter. <i>But see Martin v.

Pfaff then segued from <i>Tambolleo</i> into the section 1983 claim by arguing that \"to get liability against the Town ... the underlying act done by the individual has got to be liable under 1983. You don't have Kristen Carchedi as a defendant. It's the law.\" At the conclusion of the conference, the judge stated that \"[b]ased on the law primarily as recited by Mr. Pfaff, I am going to sustain the objection.\" On inquiry from Hrones, the judge made clear that he was sustaining the objection as to both the ch. 258 negligence claims and the section 1983 excessive force claim.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn23\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23_ref\">23</a>\n        <p> We may, of course, uphold a correct ruling even if the reasons given for it are wrong<i>Hope Furnace Assocs., Inc. v.

Applying this analysis to police pursuit cases, the Court noted, \"[l]ike prison officials facing a riot, the police on an occasion calling for fast action have obligations that tend to tug against each other....

Prior to trial, Magistrate Judge Swartwood, presiding with the parties' consent, bifurcated Wilson's claims against the individual defendants from his claims against the Towns. As the trial date approached, the roster of defendants shrank. Ultimately, a jury entered verdicts in favor of defendant-appellee James Crosby, a Mendon police officer, and Stephen Sweet, a Hopedale police officer, on claims that they had used excessive force in subduing Wilson.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The jury also found for defendant-appellee Dennis Grady, the Mendon Chief of Police, on claims of negligent training and supervision.

On May 18, 1996, officer James Crosby, while on patrol on North Street in Mendon, Massachusetts, observed a green convertible stray across the double yellow median line and then drift back to the shoulder of the road, narrowly missing a parked vehicle. Crosby activated his auxiliary lights and signaled the car to stop. On approaching the driver's side of the car, Crosby detected a mild odor of alcohol. Crosby observed a passenger, Nancy Wilson, lying face down with her head wedged between the convertible's front bucket seats. When Crosby asked the driver, Richard Wilson, whether his female passenger was all right, he replied, \"she's f'in cocked.\" Crosby summoned officer Kristen Carchedi to the scene to attend to Nancy Wilson. Officer Sherri Tagliaferri also responded to the call, and assisted Carchedi and Crosby in taking Nancy Wilson into protective custody.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At Crosby's request, Richard Wilson produced a valid driver's license but was unable to locate the vehicle's registration papers. Suspecting that Wilson might be intoxicated, Crosby directed him to perform several field sobriety tests. The results were sufficiently suggestive to cause Crosby to place Wilson under arrest for operating under the influence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Upon being placed in the rear compartment of Crosby's cruiser, Wilson began screaming epithets and slamming his body against the back of the seat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the station, while Crosby was completing booking formalities, Wilson again became belligerent. Crosby escorted him to a cell. Once inside, Wilson began to kick at the cell door. Crosby ordered Wilson to stop. When Wilson persisted in kicking at the door, Crosby ordered him to step out of the cell.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Wilson refused to comply. Officer Tagliaferri then attempted to flush Wilson from the cell by spraying him with pepper gas.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Unable to find her target, Tagliaferri gave the gas cannister to Crosby, who after several attempts, succeeded in squirting the gas in Wilson's face. Wilson responded with a tirade of threats and obscenities. Alarmed by the ferocity of Wilson's outburst, Crosby asked that reinforcements be summoned from the neighboring Town of Hopedale.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wilson in the meantime succeeded in kicking open the door of the cell. He then rushed into the vestibule of the cellblock with Crosby and Tagliaferri in hot pursuit. Crosby leapt on Wilson's back while Tagliaferri grabbed Wilson's feet. Wilson and the officers tumbled to the floor where the scrimmage continued. Carchedi, who was not present when the struggle began, suddenly appeared, and from a crouching position let loose a spray of pepper gas, hitting Wilson and Crosby in the face.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Crosby and Tagliaferri eventually succeeded in manacling Wilson's legs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At some point during the struggle, Wilson suffered a cut to his chin, prompting Crosby to request that an ambulance be called.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> While waiting for the ambulance, Crosby handcuffed Wilson to a restraining rail, after which Wilson spat at him. Once the ambulance arrived, Crosby unshackled Wilson from the rail, and placed him prone on the floor. Officer Sweet, who was assisting Crosby, restrained Wilson by placing his foot on Wilson's back. Wilson was taken, still manacled, by stretcher to the ambulance. Crosby accompanied Wilson to the hospital. During the ambulance ride, Wilson screamed threats and obscenities and spat at Crosby. Wilson was treated at the hospital for the cut to his chin.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Procedural History</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 29, 1997, Wilson served notice on the Mendon Board of Selectmen of his negligence claims against the officers and his intent to seek damages from the Town.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Wilson gave similar notice to the Hopedale Board of Selectmen on November 5, 1997. On May 12, 1998, Wilson filed a complaint against the Towns of Mendon and Hopedale and Mendon officers Crosby, Sergeant Philip Dunlavey, and Chief Grady. The complaint also named as defendants Hopedale officers Sweet, Todd Boldy and Mark Boldy, as well as Eugene Costanza, the Hopedale police chief.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Carchedi and Tagliaferri were not named as defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint, in twenty counts, accused the defendant officers of federal and state civil rights violations. The chiefs of police were alleged to have failed to properly train and supervise their officers. Wilson also brought negligent training claims against the Towns, as well as numerous common law claims against the defendant officers, including claims for assault and battery, conversion, malicious prosecution, false arrest, false imprisonment, abuse of process, negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress, invasion of privacy, defamation, negligence, and civil conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 21, 1999, Magistrate Judge Swartwood bifurcated the claims against the named officers and their supervisors from the municipal liability claims.

The court also refused to instruct the jury that Crosby could be found liable as a joint venturer with Carchedi or for having failed to intervene to protect Wilson from Carchedi. Wilson duly objected. On December 17, 1999, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Crosby, Sweet, and Chief Grady. On December 21, 1999, judgment was entered for the Town of Mendon.

An officer may be held liable not only for his personal use of excessive force, but also for his failure to intervene in appropriate circumstances to protect an arrestee from the excessive use of force by his fellow officers. <i>Gaudreault v. Municipality of Salem,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"554019\"><a href=\"/opinion/554019/robert-a-gaudreault-v-municipality-of-salem-massachusetts/\"><span class=\"volume\">923</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span></a></span>, 207 n. 3 (1st Cir.1990). Liability will attach to the municipal employer where its failure to properly train its officers \"amounts to deliberate indifference to the rights of persons with whom the police come into contact,\" and where a specific deficiency in training is the \"moving force\" behind a constitutional injury. <i>City of Canton v.

A supervisory officer may be held liable for the behavior of his subordinate officers where his \"action or inaction [is] affirmative[ly] link[ed] ... to that behavior in the sense that it could be characterized as `supervisory encouragement, condonation or acquiescence' <i>or</i> `gross negligence amounting to deliberate indifference.'\" <i>Lipsett v.

That Carchedi had sprayed Wilson (and Crosby) with pepper gas during the scuffle in the cellblock was not late-breaking news. Wilson's April 29, 1997 presentment letter to the Town of Mendon asserted that Carchedi had \"maced\" him in the face, causing him to fall \"face-first to the floor,\" allegations that were repeated in the complaint.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> Carchedi (and Tagliaferri) were, however, portrayed in the presentment letter and complaint as brave officers who had come \"forward with the truth,\" only to be \"ridiculed, harassed, ostracized, and silenced\" for their temerity. Neither Carchedi nor Tagliaferri was named as a defendant in the complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As previously noted, Magistrate Judge Swartwood had bifurcated the individual claims against the defendant officers from Wilson's claims against the municipal defendants. In this regard, the court was treading a familiar path. Without a finding of a constitutional violation on the part of a municipal employee, there cannot be a finding of section 1983 damages liability on the part of the municipality. <i>Heller,</i> 475 U.S. at 798-99, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111630\"><a href=\"/opinion/111630/los-angeles-v-heller/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1571</span></a></span>. Thus, a defendant's verdict in a bifurcated trial forecloses any further action against the municipality, resulting in less expense for the litigants, and a lighter burden on the court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> On the other hand, a verdict against the municipal employee will almost always result in satisfaction of the judgment by the municipality because of the indemnification provisions typically found in bargaining agreements between municipalities and their employee unions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is, however, nothing to prevent a plaintiff from foregoing the naming of an individual officer as a defendant and proceeding directly to trial against the municipality. Something of the sort happened in <i>Beck v. City of Pittsburgh,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"722376\"><a href=\"/opinion/722376/robert-beck-v-city-of-pittsburgh/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">966</span></a></span>, 967 (3d Cir.1996), where, after bifurcation, the plaintiff's phase one case against the defendant officer ended in a mistrial. Plaintiff then dismissed the case against the officer, and was permitted to proceed against the city on the claim that it had tolerated a custom and policy of condoning the use of excessive force by its officers, among them the original defendant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The added expense aside, the reasons that plaintiffs almost never choose to proceed against the municipality directly are self-evident. The predicate burden of proving a constitutional harm on the part of a municipal employee remains an element of the case regardless of the route chosen and is much easier to flesh out when the tortfeasor is a party amenable to the full powers of discovery. The burden of placing that harm in the context of a causative municipal custom and policy is significantly more onerous than the task of simply proving that an actionable wrong occurred. And finally, an abstract entity like a municipality may present a much less compelling face to a jury than a flesh and blood defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The counter-argument advanced by appellees rests on the proposition that a court may \"not permit the adjudication or determination of the rights or liabilities of a person unless that person is actually or constructively before it.\" <i>See, e.g., Brown v. American Nat. Bank,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"229833\"><a href=\"/opinion/229833/brown-v-american-nat-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">911</span></a></span>, 914 (10th Cir.1952) (\"It is a familiar rule of frequent enunciation that judgment may not be entered with binding effect against one not actually or constructively before the court.\"). From this truism, appellees extract the falsity that because Wilson failed to name Carchedi as a defendant, he \"cannot now complain that the court refused to permit the jury to make a factual determination regarding her conduct.\" The reason that this second assertion is wrong is that Wilson was not seeking an adjudication of Carchedi's rights, nor a judgment binding on her personally. Wilson rather was seeking a factual finding regarding the implications of Carchedi's conduct for the possible liability of the Town of Mendon as her employer.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> The issue remains, however, whether Wilson, under the circumstances of this case, should have been permitted to seek a finding against Carchedi as a fulcrum to use against the Town of Mendon in a subsequent trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>The Trial and Its Prequel</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To understand how the issue of Carchedi's liability came to be framed as it is on appeal, it is necessary to visit the rulings on the subject made by the Magistrate Judge as the trial progressed, and then to explore the background against which the case was tried.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial began in a state of confusion as to exactly who and what were to be tried:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT: Now, Mr. Hrones [Wilson's counsel], my understanding is the individuals that are left in this case are: James Crosby, Dennis Grady, Philip Dunlavey, the Boldys are out, Steven Sweet, and Eugene Costanza?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hrones replied that the Town of Mendon remained in the case on the ch. 258 negligence claims, but confessed uncertainty regarding the individual defendants.

Accordingly, Chief Costanza and Sergeant Dunlavey were introduced to the venire as defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> Then, after a lunch break, Hrones announced that Wilson was dismissing all claims against Costanza and Dunlavey, along with most of the common law claims against the remaining defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the conclusion of her opening statement, Lipede framed the issues for the jury as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ladies and gentlemen, I would ask that you keep an open eye &#8212; an open mind when you review the evidence. After you review the evidence of the video-tape, along with Mr. Wilson's testimony and even after you hear the testimony of the defendants, you will find that defendant James Crosby, who used pepper spray unnecessarily, should be liable to Richard Wilson for the use of excessive force; you will also find that Steven Sweet from the Town of Hopedale is liable to Richard Wilson for the use of excessive force; and you will find that defendant Dennis Grady, who is the chief of the Mendon Police Department, is liable for failing to properly train defendant James Crosby; and you will also find that the town of Hopedale was negligent in failing to train its officer Steven Sweet for negligence. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Lipede alluded to the second pepper spray incident involving Carchedi in her narrative of the facts, she did not suggest to the jury that Wilson was pressing any claim against Carchedi directly, or by extension, against Crosby based on anything Carchedi had done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the third day of trial, however, Hrones attempted to elicit an opinion from Melvin Tucker, a use-of-force expert called by Wilson, as to whether Carchedi's use of pepper spray during the scuffle in the vestibule was justified.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> The question drew an immediate objection, precipitating a lengthy discussion at sidebar. Crosby's lawyer (Pfaff) argued that Carchedi</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">is not a defendant in this case, and you are not going to nail the Town on a [section 1983] claim or you are not going to try to get the jury to nail Crosby because Carchedi did something wrong. Secondly, your theory of negligence in this case does not stem from anything that Kristen Carchedi did, and your 258 letter ... does not indicate at all that Kristen Carchedi was negligent.... So you are precluded from getting that claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After further discussion, the court sustained the objection.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> The reasons for the judge's ruling were not initially clear, but it soon became apparent that he agreed with Pfaff's argument that the failure to assert a claim against Carchedi in the ch. 258 presentment letter also precluded the prosecution of a claim against her under section 1983. The ruling clearly confused the prerequisites of an action under ch. 258 with those of federal section 1983. Section 1983, unlike ch. 258, has no presentment requirement. A section 1983 complaint need only comply with the liberal \"notice pleading\" standards of the Federal Rules.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a> <i>See Leatherman v.

The allegation in Wilson's complaint, that Carchedi had \"maced\" him in the face, was sufficient to satisfy this liberal pleading standard.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue resurfaced in an identical context on the seventh day of trial, when during the cross-examination of Chief Grady's use-of-force expert, Lt. Daniel Wicks, Hrones again raised the issue of the appropriateness of Carchedi's use of pepper spray. This drew an immediate objection. At sidebar, Kesten pressed the notice issue:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR. KESTEN: Judge, we went through this. We went through the presentment letter. Mr. Pfaff gave [you] the cases. They had every opportunity to put the Town on notice.... The law is clear on this. They never said for a moment that Officer Carchedi [had done something wrong] until Mr. Hrones actually called me this summer and said he might amend the complaint, and I said, Go ahead and try it. He didn't do it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">To this, Hrones responded:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR.

You can [choose] whoever you want to charge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT: I've made a ruling on this before, and I'm going to be consistent. I'm going to sustain the objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a charging conference the following day, Pfaff asked the court for an instruction \"that the jury is not to consider the actions of Miss Carchedi for any purposes of liability against any of the defendants.... [A]s I have pointed out before, Carchedi has not been named as a defendant here for 1983 purposes, and I think Mr. Hrones is still trying to push that point.\" The court declined to give the requested instruction, but cautioned Hrones against making any argument about Carchedi \"with respect to recovery in this case.\" When Hrones objected to the restriction, arguing that Crosby and Carchedi might be found by the jury to have acted as co-venturers during the second spraying incident, the court responded, \"That is my ruling. That's been my ruling. I've been consistent all the way through on that issue.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, on the ninth and closing day of trial, the issue arose as to the extent counsel would be permitted to refer to Carchedi in closing argument. When the court indicated that it was inclined to exclude all mention of her, both sides objected, reminding the judge that the jury had heard a substantial amount of testimony about Carchedi and had seen repeated showings of the videotape. The court relented, stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I'm not going to go through each one of the alleged excessive force [incidents] because it's not for me to find exactly what occurred. It's for the jury to determine what exactly occurred. So consistent with that, my ruling is[,] is that obviously anything that's on the tape is in evidence and can be commented on. There will be no argument to the jury that actions by Officers Tagliaferri and Carchedi were in any way, in any way part of the liability of any of the defendants left in this case. And that's how I'm going to do it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What makes this case unusual is that Carchedi was not, contrary to expectation, named as a defendant by Wilson. The reason Carchedi was not named becomes apparent only on a close reading of the trial transcript and the pleadings filed in a related and previously tried case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without delving into unnecessary detail, Richard Wilson's encounter with Crosby and Carchedi on the night of May 18, 1996, played itself out against a backdrop of parochial police politics. The Mendon Police Department, small as it was, was riven by a factional struggle over appointments to its few full-time positions. As it happened, at the time of Wilson's arrest, Carchedi and Crosby were pitted against one another as finalists for one of those positions. The selectmen eventually awarded the appointment to Crosby. Tagliaferri, who had unsuccessfully vied for another open position, filed a complaint, later joined by Carchedi, with the EEOC and the MCAD alleging disparate treatment in the Town's consideration of their candidacies. In August of 1997, the two women officers, together with Tagliaferri's step-father, Martin Auty, a Mendon selectman and police lieutenant, brought a lawsuit (the Auty case) against the Town, the police union, and most of their departmental colleagues (Chief Grady and Crosby among them) alleging, <i>inter alia,</i> espionage, defamation, gender discrimination, retaliation and invasion of privacy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a> Among the allegations in the complaint was a claim that Carchedi and Tagliaferri had been unfairly disciplined for suggesting that the videotape of the altercation with Wilson had been tampered with as part of a cover-up.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April of 1997, Wilson's criminal case came to trial. Carchedi and Tagliaferri testified favorably for Wilson, leading to his acquittal on all charges. After Wilson brought the instant complaint, the Auty case went to trial before Magistrate Judge Swartwood. The trial went badly for the plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two weeks before the jury was seated, Chief Grady, Crosby and the Town of Mendon were permitted to amend their answer to the complaint by asserting a counterclaim alleging, <i>inter alia,</i> a civil conspiracy on the part of Auty, Carchedi and Tagliaferri. In essence, the defendants maintained that the three plaintiffs had conspired to perjure themselves at Wilson's criminal trial by testifying that Wilson had not appeared intoxicated at the time of his arrest and that Crosby had used unnecessary force during the confrontation in the cellblock.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a> The defendants claimed that the goal of the conspiracy was to assist Wilson in his civil case as a means of punishing the Town for its failure to give Carchedi a permanent position and to retaliate against Crosby for having taken the appointment in her stead.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 16, 1999, after a twenty-five day trial, the jury ruled against plaintiffs on all claims and found for the Town of Mendon and Crosby on the civil conspiracy counterclaim. The jury awarded $25,000 in damages to the Town of Mendon and $5,000 in damages to Crosby, which were apportioned among the three plaintiffs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the jury's finding in the Auty case, Carchedi (and Tagliaferri) were, to put it mildly, \"damaged goods,\" a fact of which all involved in the instant trial, including Magistrate Judge Swartwood, were keenly aware. On the first day of trial, prior to the empanelment, the subject of the prior jury verdict arose obliquely during a discussion of the viability of Wilson's claim of malicious prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR. KESTEN: He has a malicious prosecution claim. To do that he needs to show he was acquitted. There's a first larger question. If he wants to press it, if he wants to, the defense is that he wasn't acquitted because the prosecution wasn't malicious. He was acquitted because there was a conspiracy from these people to lie for him ... which was proven. It goes in for that. That's issue preclusion [sic]. That's been proven that the three officers, J. Martin Auty, Kristen [Carchedi], and Sherri Tagliaferri, conspired to lie in the Wilson case. That was the finding of the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After some further discussion, the court ruled that \"if the malicious prosecution claim is around and the defendants say that the reason why he was acquitted [was] because everybody was in the tank with him, then I'm going to allow them to explore that.\" In response to this ruling Hrones announced, prior to opening statements, that the claims of malicious prosecution and false arrest were being dropped.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the circumstances, the decision not to name Carchedi as a defendant, or to call her as a witness at trial, despite the goading of the defendants to do so, was a predictable choice given the near certainty that her presence would have opened the door to evidence of the jury's finding in the Auty case. Wilson's alternate strategy was to concentrate his fire on Crosby and Chief Grady, a choice that the defendants had clearly anticipated, and one to which Wilson, after some initial first-day confusion, clearly committed himself. Only after the trial was well underway did Wilson seek to reinject Carchedi into the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find Wilson's mid-trial switch in strategy troubling and ultimately unfair. What Wilson, through counsel, was seeking to accomplish was to wield Carchedi as a blunt instrument against the Town of Mendon without having the jury exposed to the taint of the verdict against her in the Auty case. Hence, Wilson decided to omit Carchedi from the case as a defendant and to drop all claims that would have permitted the defendants to present evidence, as they were prepared to do, that Wilson's criminal acquittal had been obtained through Carchedi's perjured testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a practical matter, the contours of a trial are often defined by the litigating positions taken by the parties' lawyers. At times counsel will, for tactical advantage, seek to try the case on the broadest grounds possible. Or there may be, as was the case here, sound reasons for drawing the issues to be tried as circumspectly as possible. For Wilson, Carchedi was potentially the quintessential elephant in the jury box. She was no great bargain for the defendants either, given the finding of their own expert that her use of force had been inappropriate. Both sides went into the trial with every reason to exile Carchedi to the periphery of the litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In recognition of the realities of the give-and-take of trial, appellate courts are reluctant to second-guess the tactical decisions of trial counsel for fear of opening a floodgate of buyer's remorse. Thus, it is the rule that a litigant will be held to the strategic choices made by counsel in all but the most egregious instances. <i>See, e.g., United States v.

The struggle in the cellblock vestibule lasted only a few seconds. Carchedi was not initially involved as a combatant. She appeared on the scene while Crosby and Tagliaferri were thrashing about in the effort to subdue Wilson. In these circumstances, even if the jury were to credit Wilson's testimony that Carchedi had ordered Crosby to hold up Wilson's head (the better to spray him), it could not reasonably find that Crosby had an opportunity to reflect on the wisdom of obeying Carchedi's command.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The request for a \"joint tortfeasor\" instruction fails for a similar reason, although as a preliminary matter, we do not agree with appellees' argument that \"`joint tortfeasor' liability does not appear to exist under [section] 1983.\" As we pointed out in <i>Martinez v.

There was no basis, however, for the insinuation that attorney Strand had incited Wilson to perjury. But in context the comment was fleeting and, given the trial theatrics in which counsel for both sides engaged, would likely have been recognized by the jury as yet another display of barristerial excess. Moreover, we are confident, that if there was any prejudice, it was cured by the court's admonition to the jury, both in its preliminary and concluding instructions, that the lawyers' statements and arguments were not to be considered as evidence. <i>See Brandt v.

According to Wilson, he began voluntarily walking towards the cell after Crosby refused him permission to make a telephone call to his uncle, a police detective in a neighboring town. Enraged, Crosby shoved Wilson against a wall, knocked him to the ground, and dragged him into the cell with his hands cuffed behind his back. Once in the cell, Crosby kneed Wilson in the ribs and punched him several times. Wilson admitted to shouting obscenities and kicking at the cell door in response to Crosby's taunts, but claimed to have regained his composure when Crosby, without warning, opened the cell door and sprayed several jets of pepper gas, striking Wilson in the face on the third attempt. Crosby threw Wilson against the wall before leaving the cell. Wilson succeeded in kicking the cell door open to escape from the fumes. He then ran into the vestibule searching for Nancy Wilson. Crosby jumped him from behind, while Tagliaferri tackled his legs. Wilson testified that after he was wrestled to the floor, Carchedi ordered Crosby to lift his [Wilson's] head so that she could spray him in \"the f'in face.\" Crosby wrenched Wilson's head back while Carchedi sprayed both men in the face. Wilson stated that he could not recall how he had sustained the laceration to his chin, but was certain that it had not happened during the struggle in the vestibule. Wilson testified that after later viewing a video surveillance tape of the incident with one of his attorneys, he had come to the realization that his chin had been cut when he was kicked in the head by officer Sweet after being unshackled from the restraining bar. Significant aspects of Wilson's trial testimony were inconsistent with his deposition testimony and the allegations made in the complaint. Appellees claim that Wilson altered or enlarged his earlier testimony after he realized that it was contradicted by the surveillance tape. Although rejected by the jury, we recite the gist of Wilson's trial testimony for its relevance to the issues of the propriety of Chief Grady's counsel's closing argument and the omitted instruction on Crosby's failure to protect Wilson from Carchedi</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> The hospital record noted no injury to Wilson other than the chin laceration</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> The Massachusetts Tort Claims Act, Mass.

Unindicted co-conspirators are frequently the subject of adverse jury findings, as are employees whose employers are sued directly on a theory of respondeat superior for their alleged torts</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> Chief Costanza was alleged to have been negligent in his training and supervision of Sweet.

The principal case cited by Pfaff at side bar was<i>Tambolleo v. Town of West Boylston,</i> 34 Mass.

Pfaff then segued from <i>Tambolleo</i> into the section 1983 claim by arguing that \"to get liability against the Town ... the underlying act done by the individual has got to be liable under 1983. You don't have Kristen Carchedi as a defendant. It's the law.\" At the conclusion of the conference, the judge stated that \"[b]ased on the law primarily as recited by Mr. Pfaff, I am going to sustain the objection.\" On inquiry from Hrones, the judge made clear that he was sustaining the objection as to both the ch. 258 negligence claims and the section 1983 excessive force claim.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn23\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23_ref\">23</a>\n        <p> We may, of course, uphold a correct ruling even if the reasons given for it are wrong<i>Hope Furnace Assocs., Inc. v.

Applying this analysis to police pursuit cases, the Court noted, \"[l]ike prison officials facing a riot, the police on an occasion calling for fast action have obligations that tend to tug against each other.... They are supposed to act decisively and to show restraint at the same moment, and their decisions have to be made `in haste, under pressure, and frequently without the luxury of a second chance.'\" <i>Lewis,</i> 523 U.S. at 853, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118214\"><a href=\"/opinion/118214/countyof-sacramento-v-lewis/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
