Mark L. Wolf, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                         Lynch, Chief Judge,\n               Torruella and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Kenneth W. Salinger, Assistant Attorney General, and Peter\nSacks, Assistant Attorney General, with whom Martha Coakley,\nAttorney   General   of   Massachusetts,    was   on   brief   for\nappellant/cross-appellee.\n     Christopher P. Silva with whom Thomas H. Wintner, Gail E.\nCornwall, and Edwards Angell Palmer & Dodge, LLP were on brief for\nappellee/cross-appellant.\n\n\n\n                           July 31, 2009\n\f           LYNCH, Chief Judge. By nearly a two-to-one margin in the\n\nyear 2000, Massachusetts voters passed Article 120, which amended\n\nthe state constitution to disqualify currently incarcerated felons\n\nfrom voting in certain elections.         Shortly thereafter, the state\n\nlegislature extended this disqualification by statute, Chapter 150,\n\nto prevent inmates from voting in all Massachusetts elections.\n\n           In 2001, several incarcerated felons in state custody,\n\nchallenged these provisions (collectively \"Article 120\") by suing\n\nthe Secretary of the Commonwealth in federal court.                 This appeal\n\nconcerns   two   of    their   claims:    (1)    that      the   Commonwealth's\n\ndisenfranchisement     provisions   violated         the   Voting   Rights   Act\n\n(\"VRA\") § 2, 42 U.S.C. § 1973, because the percentage of imprisoned\n\nfelons who are Hispanic or African-American is higher than the\n\npercentages of those groups in the population of the state; and (2)\n\nthat the provisions violated the Ex Post Facto Clause, U.S. Const.\n\nart. I, § 10, as to those inmates who were not disqualified from\n\nvoting before the these provisions took effect.              As to their claim\n\nunder the VRA, the plaintiffs make no allegation of any intentional\n\ndiscrimination or of any history by Massachusetts of intentional\n\ndiscrimination against minority voters.          All they have claimed is\n\nthat past practices in the Massachusetts criminal justice system\n\nproduced   inmate     populations   which,      in    combination     with   the\n\ndisqualification of inmates imprisoned for felonies, have resulted\n\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fin disproportionate disqualification of minorities from voting.\n\nTheirs is a claim of disparate impact.\n\n            After allowing initial discovery, the district court in\n\n2007 denied the Commonwealth's motion for entry of judgment on the\n\npleadings on plaintiffs' VRA claim but granted the Commonwealth's\n\nmotion for summary judgment on the Ex Post Facto Clause argument.\n\n            We think it clear from the language, history, and context\n\nof the VRA that Congress never intended § 2 to prohibit the states\n\nfrom disenfranchising currently incarcerated felons. We do not say\n\nthat direct vote denial claims of other types may not be brought\n\nunder § 2, only that no VRA claim is stated against a state law\n\nwhich disenfranchises incarcerated felons.           We reverse and order\n\nthe dismissal of the VRA § 2 claim.         We affirm the grant of summary\n\njudgment on the Ex Post Facto claim.\n\n                                   I.\n\nA.          Enactment of the Massachusetts            Incarcerated    Felon\n            Disenfranchisement Provisions\n\n            Before Article 120 was enacted, prisoners were able to\n\nvote by absentee ballot.        In 1997, there was an unsuccessful\n\nproposal for legislation to disenfranchise currently incarcerated\n\npersons for certain felonies: murder, rape, other sex-related\n\noffenses,   and   controlled   substances      offenses.    Massachusetts\n\nprisoners   responded   by   forming    a    political   action   committee\n\n(\"PAC\"), aimed at influencing criminal justice issues, including\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fsentencing, prison reform, and \"Draconian laws on punishment.\"\n\nPACs, inter alia, raise money for and endorse candidates.\n\n            State elected officials reacted swiftly.               On August 12,\n\n1997,   then-Acting   Governor    Cellucci        proposed    a   constitutional\n\namendment that would disenfranchise all incarcerated individuals\n\n(not just felons), saying:\n\n                 Criminals behind bars have no business\n            deciding who should govern the law-abiding\n            citizens of the Commonwealth. This proposed\n            amendment will ensure that criminals pay their\n            debt to society before they regain their right\n            to participate in the political process.\n\nThe   legislature   did   not   act   on    this    proposal.       Rather,   the\n\nlegislature approved a different proposed amendment that would\n\ndisenfranchise only those currently incarcerated for felonies.\n\nLawmakers received the legal opinions of House and Senate Counsel\n\nthat such an alternative amendment would be constitutional under\n\nthe U.S. Constitution.\n\n            Article 120, the proposed amendment to Article 3 of the\n\nAmendments to the state constitution, was presented to the voters\n\nalong with an Information for Voters Guide. That Guide constitutes\n\nrelevant    legislative   history.          The    Guide     included   150-word\n\narguments written by proponents and opponents of each ballot\n\nquestion.    The statement from the         proponents stated, \"A yes vote\n\nprevents criminals serving time for a felony conviction from voting\n\nin Massachusetts's elections while in jail.\"                      The proponents\n\nargued:\n\n                                      -4-\n\f            When someone in Massachusetts is sentenced to\n            jail for committing a felony, we deprive them\n            of their liberty and right to exercise control\n            over their own lives, yet current law allows\n            these same criminals to continue to exercise\n            control over our lives by voting from prison.\n            This amendment will change the law that gives\n            jailed criminals the right to vote.\n\n            Massachusetts is one of only three states in\n            our nation where felons serving time may vote\n            while in jail. Voting yes on this important\n            question will make the Commonwealth the 48th\n            state to prohibit the practice of allowing\n            convicted criminals to vote from jail. This\n            change discriminates against no one except\n            jailed criminals.\n\n            The Guide also contained the opponents' argument:\n\n            The Constitution of Massachusetts is clear on\n            this point: Citizens retain their right to\n            vote even while incarcerated. The founders of\n            Massachusetts intended this right, and our\n            Supreme Judicial Court affirmed in in 1977.\n            In the history of the Commonwealth, we have\n            never amended our Constitution in order to\n            narrow fundamental rights. There is no reason\n            to do so now.\n\n            No one has alleged that prisoner voting has\n            harmed our democracy or social fabric. Very\n            few prisoners vote, and no one claims that\n            prisoner voting has negatively influenced any\n            election. Stripping incarcerated felons of\n            their right to vote serves no public safety\n            function. It will not deter crime, repair the\n            harm done by crime, nor help to rehabilitate\n            prisoners.\n\n            The voters approved the amendment with 60.3% voting \"yes\"\n\nto 33.9% voting \"no,\" and 5.8% of voters not casting a vote on the\n\nquestion.   The amendment took effect on December 6, 2000.   Article\n\n3 now reads:\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f            Every citizen of eighteen years of age and\n            upwards,    excepting    persons    who    are\n            incarcerated in a correctional facility due to\n            a felony conviction, and excepting persons\n            under guardianship and persons temporarily or\n            permanently disqualified by law because of\n            corrupt practices in respect to elections who\n            shall have resided within the town or district\n            in which he may claim a right to vote, six\n            calendar months next preceding any election of\n            governor, lieutenant governor, senators or\n            representatives, shall have a right to vote in\n            such   election    of   governor,   lieutenant\n            governor, senators and representatives; and no\n            other person shall be entitled to vote in such\n            election.\n\nMass. Const. amend. art. 3 (emphasis added).\n\n            The Massachusetts legislature then enacted Chapter 150 of\n\nthe Acts of 2001, which effectuated Article 120 by broadening the\n\nban on felon voting to cover all Massachusetts elections and by\n\nchanging the statutory requirements for obtaining absentee ballots.\n\nChapter 150 took effect November 27, 2001.               Unlike many other\n\nstates, Massachusetts does not disqualify convicted felons from\n\nvoting once they are released from prison.\n\nB.          Procedural History of the Litigation\n\n            Plaintiffs   Paul   Simmons,   an    African-American,    Pedro\n\nValentin,    a   Hispanic-American,      and    Dennis    J.   Beldotti,   a\n\nCaucasian-American, are Massachusetts residents currently in the\n\ncustody of the Massachusetts Department of Correction for felonies\n\nthey committed on or before December 5, 2000.              Plaintiffs were\n\neligible to be Massachusetts voters before that date, but the\n\nrecord does not reveal whether they were registered to vote.\n\n                                   -6-\n\f            Plaintiffs' pro se complaint was amended twice by court-\n\nappointed counsel.             Their final amended complaint alleged that\n\nArticle    120     violates        §    2    of     the    VRA    because    it   has     a\n\n\"disproportionately            adverse      effect    on    the     voting   rights     of\n\nAfrican-Americans and Hispanic Americans compared to its effect on\n\nthe voting rights of other citizens.\"                     This effect \"is caused by,\n\namong     other        things,    the       facts    that       African-Americans       and\n\nHispanic-Americans          are    over-represented          in    the   population      of\n\nMassachusetts          incarcerated         felons,       and     that   there    exists\n\nconsiderable racial and ethnic bias, both direct and subtle, in the\n\nMassachusetts court system.\"1                Article 120, plaintiffs contended,\n\n\"interact[s] with social and historical conditions to cause an\n\ninequality        in     the     opportunities        enjoyed       by   minority       and\n\nnon-minority voters to elect their preferred representatives.\"\n\n            In describing plaintiffs' complaint, which alleges a\n\n\"vote denial\" claim, we distinguish vote denial cases from vote\n\ndilution2 claims under § 2 of the VRA.                      The Supreme Court first\n\n\n     1\n         By \"over-represented\" the complaint referred to the\nrepresentation of African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans in the\nprison population compared with their representation in the\nMassachusetts population at large, but gave no statistics.\n     2\n        Vote dilution claims comprise the vast majority of § 2\nclaims. See E. Katz et al., Documenting Discrimination in Voting:\nJudicial Findings Under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act Since\n1982, 39 U. Mich. J.L. Reform 643, 650 (2005), available at\nhttp://sitemaker.umich.edu/votingrights/files/finalreport.pdf; D.P.\nTokaji, The New Vote Denial: Where Election Reform Meets the Voting\nRights Act, 57 S.C. L. Rev. 689, 709 (2006) (\"[I]t is clear that\nthe overwhelming majority of Section 2 lawsuits since 1982 have\n\n                                             -7-\n\farticulated the distinction in explaining that \"[t]he right to vote\n\ncan be affected by a dilution of voting power as well as by an\n\nabsolute prohibition on casting a ballot.\"          Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S.\n\n630, 640 (1993) (quoting Allen v. State Bd. of Elections, 393 U.S.\n\n544, 569 (1969)). Thus in voting rights parlance, \"'[v]ote denial'\n\nrefers to practices that prevent people from voting or having their\n\nvotes counted.\"       D.P. Tokaji, The New Vote Denial: Where Election\n\nReform Meets the Voting Rights Act, 57 S.C. L. Rev. 689, 691\n\n(2006).    Vote denial cases challenge practices such as literacy\n\ntests, poll taxes, white primaries, and English-only ballots.              Id.\n\nBy contrast, vote dilution challenges involve \"practices that\n\ndiminish      minorities'   political   influence,\"     such    as   at-large\n\nelections and redistricting plans that either weaken or keep\n\nminorities' voting strength weak.          Id.; see also P.S. Karlan, The\n\nImpact of the Voting Rights Act on African Americans, in Voting\n\nRights and Redistricting 121, 122 (M.E. Rush ed., 1998).\n\n              To be clear, plaintiffs did not allege and have disavowed\n\nmaking a § 2 vote dilution claim, such as that the votes of\n\nAfrican-Americans and Hispanics who are not imprisoned for felonies\n\nhave been diluted by Article 120.          This case also does not involve\n\nany   claim    that   generalized   rules    or   practices    governing   the\n\nadministration of elections have resulted in a disproportionate\n\n\ninvolved claims of vote dilution and not vote denial.\"); see\ngenerally, Bartlett v. Strickland, 129 S. Ct. 1231, 1240-41 (2009)\n(plurality opinion).\n\n                                     -8-\n\fdenial of votes of minorities.          Further, plaintiffs have not\n\nasserted that the state has otherwise created barriers to the\n\nelection of minority group members or other participation of\n\nminorities in the political process.           Finally, the plaintiffs'\n\ncomplaint made no allegation that the Commonwealth acted with\n\nracially discriminatory intent or purpose in enacting Article 120,\n\nand plaintiffs have specifically disavowed any such claim. This is\n\na claim based purely on the allegation that Article 120 has a\n\ndisparate   impact   on   minorities    by   disqualifying   from   voting\n\nimprisoned felons.\n\n            In support of their pleadings, the complaint referred to\n\nand appended a 1994 Final Report by the Commission to Study Racial\n\nand Ethnic Bias in the Courts to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial\n\nCourt (\"SJC\").3   Plaintiffs alleged the legislators were aware of\n\nor should have been aware of the conclusions in that 1994 Report.\n\nThat 1994 Report, however, was not referenced in or part of the\n\nVoters Guide, and there is no claim the voters were aware of it.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n        The specific findings in the 1994 Commission Report, as\nstated in the pleadings, included that \"racial minorities were\nunderrepresented in jury pools selected from communities with\nlarge racial and ethnic populations; that Massachusetts courts are\nan unfriendly environment for people whose primary language is not\nEnglish . . . ; and that minorities are underrepresented in [the]\nMassachusetts bar and bench.\" The 1994 Report itself goes on to\nsay, as to sentencing, that it lacked the necessary data to \"test\n[the] hypothesis\" that \"[r]acial and ethnic bias may influence\nsentencing decisions.\" The report did not conclude that any race\nbias resulted in minority defendants being sentenced as felons.\n\n                                  -9-\n\f           Plaintiffs further alleged that Article 120 is punitive\n\nin purpose and effect and therefore violates the Ex Post Facto\n\nClause as to those inmates who committed their offenses before the\n\ndisenfranchisement measures took effect.\n\n           The relief sought was a declaration that Article 120 was\n\nunconstitutional under the Ex Post Facto Clause and illegal under\n\n§ 2 of the VRA, injunctive relief, and costs and attorneys' fees.\n\n           Plaintiffs   unsuccessfully        moved     for   a   preliminary\n\ninjunction; defendant opposed, filing affidavits which described\n\nthe   legislative   history   of   Article    120     and   the   ratification\n\nprocess. The parties conducted written discovery.4 Defendant then\n\nmoved for summary judgment as to the Ex Post Facto and equal\n\nprotection claims and for judgment on the pleadings as to the VRA\n\n§ 2 claim on January 12, 2007.               The plaintiffs opposed the\n\nCommonwealth's motions and also cross-moved for summary judgment as\n\nto the Ex Post Facto and equal protection claims.\n\n           On August 30, 2007, the district court granted the\n\nCommonwealth's motion for summary judgment on the Ex Post Facto\n\nClause claim and the equal protection claim and denied plaintiffs'\n\n\n\n      4\n        Plaintiffs served interrogatories and document requests on\ndefendant William Galvin, Secretary of the Commonwealth, seeking\ndata as to the effect of Article 120 on minorities. For example,\nplaintiffs requested through interrogatories information on all\nindividuals who have been arrested in Massachusetts since 1985 by\nname, date of birth, Social Security Number, race, ethnicity, skin\ncolor, and/or alleged offense. Defendant replied saying defendant\ndid not maintain such records and had no responsive information.\n\n                                   -10-\n\fcross-motion.      The court denied the Commonwealth's motion on the\n\nVRA claim.    On January 16, 2008, the district court certified its\n\norder on the VRA claim for interlocutory appeal.                  Plaintiffs\n\npetitioned    to   cross-appeal    on   the   Ex   Post   Facto   and   equal\n\nprotection claims.     This court granted leave to appeal all three\n\nclaims under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b).         Plaintiffs have abandoned the\n\nEqual Protection Clause claim and contest only the Ex Post Facto\n\nClause ruling, and the Commonwealth appeals the denial of its\n\nmotion for judgment on the pleadings as to the VRA § 2 claims.\n\nC.          Standard of Review\n\n            Our review of the court's ruling on both claims is de\n\nnovo, and we take the facts in the light most favorable to the\n\nplaintiffs.     Estate of Bennett v. Wainwright, 548 F.3d 155, 163,\n\n165 (1st Cir. 2008) (considering dismissals under Rule 12(c) and\n\nRule 56).     We treat the denial of a motion for judgment on the\n\npleadings     \"much   like   a   Rule   12(b)(6)    motion   to   dismiss.\"\n\nPérez-Acevedo v. Rivero-Cubano, 520 F.3d 26, 29 (1st Cir. 2008).5\n\n\"[T]o survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion (and, by extension, a Rule\n\n\n\n     5\n        Despite the nomenclature of the defendant's motion on the\nVRA § 2 claim as a motion for judgment on the pleadings, in fact\nboth sides brought additional undisputed materials to the court's\nattention. \"In reviewing a motion [for judgment on the pleadings]\nunder Rule 12(c) . . . we may consider 'documents the authenticity\nof which are not disputed by the parties; . . . documents central\nto plaintiffs' claim; [and] documents sufficiently referred to in\nthe complaint.'\"   Curran v.

(quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 1965\n\n(2007)).     Nonetheless, questions of statutory interpretation are\n\nquestions of law ripe for resolution at the pleadings stage.              Gen.\n\nMotors Corp. v.

Two states disenfranchise felons for life.\n\n              The question of state felon disenfranchisement laws and\n\nthe VRA § 2 has been addressed by five circuits.                    Four circuits,\n\nincluding two en banc, have rejected § 2 challenges to broader\n\ndisqualifications; one panel in the Ninth Circuit had allowed such\n\na   §   2    challenge   to   go    forward,       although    it   was   ultimately\n\nunsuccessful.        The Second Circuit, consistent with our holding\n\nhere,       has   rejected    a    §    2    challenge   to     a   state   statute\n\ndisenfranchising prisoners, as well as parolees. Hayden v. Pataki,\n\n449 F.3d 305 (2d Cir. 2006) (en banc).               Faced with a state lifetime\n\nfelon disenfranchisement law, the Eleventh Circuit concluded in an\n\nen banc decision that all felon disenfranchisement claims are\n\nexcluded from the scope of § 2 of the VRA.                     Johnson v. Gov. of\n\nFla., 405 F.3d 1214 (11th Cir. 2005) (en banc).                 Two circuits have\n\nrejected      similar    claims        on    the   pleadings    without     directly\n\nconsidering whether felon disenfranchisement statutes are immune\n\nfrom attack under § 2.             Howard v. Gilmore, No. 99-2285, 2000 WL\n\n203984, at *1 (4th Cir. Feb. 23, 2000) (per curiam); Wesley v.\n\nCollins, 791 F.2d 1255, 1259-61 (6th Cir. 1986) (treating claim as\n\na dilution claim).            Our conclusion accords with that of the\n\nmajority of the circuits.\n\n              A Ninth Circuit panel decision has concluded that some\n\ndisenfranchisement statutes, not as narrow as this one, may be\n\n\n                                            -13-\n\fchallenged under § 2.

Gregoire, No. CV-96-076-RHW, 2006 WL\n\n1889273 (E.D. Wash. July 7, 2006).\n\nA.        Constitutional Background to the VRA § 2 Claim\n\n          Under the U.S. Constitution, the states generally set the\n\neligibility criteria for voters. \"[T]he Constitution 'does not\n\nconfer the right of suffrage upon any one.'\"            Rodriguez v. Popular\n\nDemocratic   Party,   457    U.S.    1,    9   (1982)   (quoting   Minor   v.\n\nHappersett, 88 U.S. (21 Wall.) 162, 178 (1875)); see also U.S.\n\nConst. art. I, § 4; id. amend. XIV, § 2; Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98,\n\n104 (2000) (per curiam) (\"The individual citizen has no federal\n\nconstitutional right to vote for electors for the President of the\n\nUnited States unless and until the state legislature chooses a\n\nstatewide election as the means to implement its power to appoint\n\nmembers of the electoral college.\").\n\n          The criteria for eligibility to vote are defined by the\n\nstates, subject to certain federal restrictions, such as the\n\nfederal constitutional prohibition on exclusion from the franchise\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\fon the basis of race, sex, or payment of a poll tax.            \"No function\n\nis more essential to the separate and independent existence of the\n\nStates and their governments than the power to determine within the\n\nlimits of the Constitution the qualifications of their own voters\n\nfor state, county, and municipal offices.\" Oregon v. Mitchell, 400\n\nU.S. 112, 125 (1970).\n\n            The power of the states to disqualify from voting those\n\nconvicted   of   crimes   is   explicitly    set   forth   in   §    2   of   the\n\nFourteenth Amendment.     The Supreme Court has held, \"the exclusion\n\nof felons from the vote has an affirmative sanction in § 2 of the\n\nFourteenth Amendment.\"         Richardson v. Ramirez, 418 U.S. 24, 55\n\n(1974). Section 2 concerns the abridgement of the right to vote at\n\nany election for \"President and Vice President of the United\n\nStates, Representatives in Congress, the Executive and Judicial\n\nofficers of a State, or members of the Legislature.\"                U.S. Const.\n\namend. XIV, § 2.     The Amendment specifically excludes (from its\n\nnon-abridgement language) and thus provides for the denial by\n\nstates of the right to vote to persons \"for participation in\n\nrebellion, or other crime.\"        Id.     The Fourteenth Amendment also\n\ngrants Congress the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation,\n\nthe provisions of that article.      Id. § 5.      Thus, the state's denial\n\nof the right to vote to felons has a constitutional grounding.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\f            Broad      felon    disenfranchisement        provisions     are\n\npresumptively constitutional.          See Richardson, 418 U.S. at 54-55.7\n\nThere,   the   Court    rejected   a    non-race-based    equal   protection\n\nchallenge      to   the    felon    disenfranchisement       provision    of\n\nCalifornia's constitution.         The Supreme Court has continued to\n\nadhere to Richardson.          See Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 634\n\n(1996) (describing principle that states may disenfranchise a\n\nconvicted felon as \"unexceptionable\").\n\n            Richardson, to be clear, does not hold that a state felon\n\ndisenfranchisement law may never raise equal protection concerns.\n\nIf a state enacts a law which disenfranchises felons \"with the\n\nintent of disenfranchising blacks,\" that state has run afoul of\n\n§ 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment.              Hunter v. Underwood, 471 U.S.\n\n222, 229 (1985) (holding Alabama's petty crime and misdemeanor\n\ndisenfranchisement        provisions      unconstitutional    under    Equal\n\nProtection Clause based on evidence of discriminatory intent); see\n\nalso City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 477\n\nn.25 (1985) (\"[In Hunter], we did not suggest that felons could\n\nnot be deprived of the vote through a statute motivated by some\n\npurpose other than racial discrimination.\").              Here, plaintiffs\n\nmake no allegation of intentional discrimination, and on appeal\n\n\n     7\n        The SJC has also recognized that under Richardson states\nmay disenfranchise felons. Dane v. Bd. of Registrars of Voters,\n371 N.E.2d 1358, 1364 (Mass. 1978) (\"Disfranchisement of convicted\ncriminals by State law was held by the . . . Supreme Court in\nRichardson . . . not to violate the equal protection clause.\").\n\n                                       -16-\n\fthey allege no constitutional violation other than the Ex Post\n\nFacto claim.    By definition, then, plaintiffs do not assert that\n\nwhatever discrimination existed in the state's criminal justice\n\nsystem   rose   to   the   level   of   an   independent   constitutional\n\nviolation which caused the vote denial.\n\n          A state's interest in preventing \"persons who . . . were\n\nnot eligible to vote because they had been convicted of felonies\"\n\nfrom inflating its voter rolls was accepted only last year by the\n\nSupreme Court as a \"neutral and nondiscriminatory reason\" for a\n\nvoter identification law. Crawford v. Marion County Election Bd.,\n\n128 S. Ct. 1610, 1619-20 (2008).\n\n          The legitimacy of the reasons for this state interest in\n\ndisqualifying imprisoned felons from voting is apparent.           Judge\n\nHenry Friendly some time ago described some of the pragmatic\n\npurposes underlying disenfranchisement laws:\n\n          [I]t can scarcely be deemed unreasonable for a\n          state to decide that perpetrators of serious\n          crimes shall not take part in electing the\n          legislators who make the laws, the executives\n          who enforce these, the prosecutors who must\n          try them for further violations, or the judges\n          who are to consider their cases.\n\nGreen v. Bd. of Elections, 380 F.2d 445, 451 (2d Cir. 1967).8\n\n\n     8\n       There are philosophical reasons as well, such as that those\nwho violate the laws so seriously have removed themselves from the\nLockean notion of the social contract:\n          The early exclusion of felons from the\n          franchise by many states could well have\n          rested on Locke's concept, so influential at\n          the time, that by entering into society every\n\n                                   -17-\n\f            Here, the Commonwealth enacted this prohibition after\n\nprisoners attempted to organize to change the laws under which\n\nthey were convicted, sentenced, and imprisoned.         The state has a\n\nstrong interest in setting its own qualifications for voters, a\n\nstrong interest in the integrity of its system of enforcing and\n\nadministering its criminal laws, and a strong interest in how its\n\ncorrectional    systems   are   maintained   and     run.    Preiser    v.\n\nRodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 491-92 (1973) (\"It is difficult to\n\nimagine an activity in which a State has a stronger interest . . .\n\nthan the administration of its prisons.\"); cf. Hayden, 449 F.3d at\n\n327.   The Massachusetts provision, it is important to note, is\n\nnarrowly tailored.     Because the disqualification is confined to\n\ncurrently imprisoned felons, the state interests it serves are\n\nclearly at their strongest.\n\n            Further, Article 120 of the Massachusetts constitution\n\ndoes not raise issues about a history of laws in Massachusetts,\n\nincluding     felon   disenfranchisement     laws,    that   were      used\n\ndeliberately to impede voting by minorities. Such historical\n\n\n          man \"authorizes the society, or which is all\n          one, the legislature thereof, to make laws for\n          him as the public good of the society shall\n          require, to the execution whereof his own\n          assistance (as to his own decrees) is due.\" A\n          man who breaks the laws he has authorized his\n          agent to make for his own governance could\n          fairly have been thought to have abandoned the\n          right to participate in further administering\n          the compact.\nGreen, 380 F.2d at 451.\n\n                                  -18-\n\fconcerns about practices in other states have been the subject of\n\nacademic    commentary.     See,    e.g.,    G.   Brooks,   Comment,     Felon\n\nDisenfranchisement: Law, History, Policy and Politics, 32 Fordham\n\nUrb. L.J. 851, 858-59 (2005) (concluding that the VRA does not\n\nreach state felon disenfranchisement laws).            Plaintiffs have made\n\nno claim that Massachusetts has historically ever used any tests\n\nor devices to discourage minority voting or minority candidates.\n\nNor is there any claim that Massachusetts has defined Article 120\n\ndisenfranchisement     in   terms    of     felonies    that    have     higher\n\nconviction rates for minorities than for whites.            Cf. Hunter, 471\n\nU.S. at 229.\n\nB.          Text, Context and Legislative History of § 2\n\n            It is against the backdrop of the Constitution's express\n\napproval of felon disenfranchisement provisions, which were not\n\nmotivated    by   intentional   race   discrimination,         that    Congress\n\nenacted the VRA in 1965.\n\n            Section 2 of the VRA, 42 U.S.C. § 1973, as amended in\n\n1982, now provides:\n\n            (a) No voting qualification or prerequisite\n            to voting or standard, practice, or procedure\n            shall be imposed or applied by any State or\n            political subdivision in a manner which\n            results in a denial or abridgement of the\n            right of any citizen of the United States to\n            vote on account of race or color . . . .\n\n            (b)   A  violation   of   subsection  (a)   is\n            established if, based on the totality of\n            circumstances, it is shown that the political\n            processes leading to nomination or election in\n\n                            -19-\n\f           the State or political subdivision are not\n           equally open to participation by members of a\n           class of citizens protected by subsection (a)\n           in that its members have less opportunity than\n           other members of the electorate to participate\n           in the political process and to elect\n           representatives of their choice.\n\nWhile the language of the original § 2 tracked the language of the\n\nFifteenth Amendment, prohibiting practices that deny or abridge\n\nthe right to vote on account of race, the 1982 amendment to § 2\n\ninserted   the    phrase   \"results    in   a    denial   or   abridgment.\"\n\n§ 1973(b) (emphasis added).        The amendment of § 2 also made clear\n\nthat an abridgement or denial could be identified \"as provided in\n\nsubsection (b),\" which was added by the 1982 amendments.\n\n           To start, it is clear that under the plain terms of the\n\nstatute, not every \"voter qualification\" is actionable under § 2.\n\nFor § 2 to apply, the burden is on the plaintiffs to make other\n\nshowings, including that the qualification \"results in a denial or\n\nabridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to\n\nvote on account of race or color.\"          § 1973(a); see also Metts v.\n\nMurphy, 363 F.3d 8, 12 (1st Cir. 2004) (en banc) (per curiam).\n\n           Plaintiffs' theory of how they meet this burden under § 2\n\nis that from the very enactment of § 2 in 1965, the broad language\n\nof § 2 has created a cause of action on these facts.           Article 120,\n\nthey   contend,   is   obviously   a   voter    disqualification   and   the\n\ndisqualification results in a denial of the right to vote \"on\n\naccount of race\" because the percentages of incarcerated felons\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\fwho are black or Hispanic are higher than those two groups in the\n\npopulation as a whole.\n\n            Plaintiffs argue the language of § 2(a) is so clear it\n\nstands alone and that rules of statutory construction prohibit\n\nconsideration of the history or context of § 2.9 Plaintiffs' claim\n\nassumes that felon disenfranchisement laws are not different from\n\nand should be treated like any other voting qualification under\n\n§ 2.      That assumption is a fatal flaw in their case.                     Felon\n\ndisenfranchisement        statutes    are    not     like   all    other   voting\n\nqualifications. Congress has treated such laws differently. They\n\nare    deeply    rooted   in   our   history,   in    our   laws,   and    in   our\n\nConstitution.        We conclude Congress did not intend § 2 to provide\n\na cause of action against Article 120.\n\n            As a matter of textual analysis, it is neither plain nor\n\nclear that plaintiffs' claim fits within the text of § 2(a).                    For\n\nexample,        it   is   logical     to     understand      the     state      law\n\n\n\n      9\n        In addition, plaintiffs contend § 2(a) must be read to be\nindependent of § 2(b), which was added by the 1982 amendments. And\neven if § 2(b) is read as informing and restricting the meaning of\n§ 2(a), plaintiffs submit, they have nonetheless stated a claim\nunder the clear language of § 2(a).\n        Plaintiffs alternatively argue that, to the extent § 2(b)\nmay be considered, it only establishes a totality of the\ncircumstances test for proving a violation of § 2(a) and in no way\nlimits the scope of § 2(a). Plaintiffs argue that, to the extent\n§ 4 and § 5 (which ban certain practices) are relevant, those later\nsections demonstrate only that Congress meant § 2(a) to be read\nbroadly. If legislative history is consulted, they argue that the\nlegislative history of § 2 establishes that their claim falls\nwithin Congress's intent in enacting § 2.\n\n                                      -21-\n\fdisenfranchisement of incarcerated felons as not \"resulting\" in a\n\ndenial     \"on   account    of     race     or   color\"   but    on   account   of\n\nimprisonment for a felony, and thus not within the text of § 2 at\n\nall.10     We agree with the Second Circuit that the language of\n\n§   2(a)    is    both     broad    and      ambiguous    and    that    judicial\n\ninterpretation of a claim concerning felon disenfranchisement\n\nunder the VRA may not be limited to the text of § 2(a) alone.                   See\n\nHayden, 449 F.3d at 315 (citing Watt v. Alaska, 451 U.S. 259, 266\n\n(1981); Boston Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States, 278 U.S. 41,\n\n48(1928)).\n\n            Under any set of rules of construction, our inquiry into\n\n§ 2(a) neither starts nor ends with an examination of that text.\n\n\"[S]tatutory interpretation turns on 'the language itself, the\n\nspecific context in which that language is used, and the broader\n\ncontext of the statute as a whole.'\"              Nken v.

The direction to look at context,\n\n\n     10\n         There are questions as to whether a claim of disparate\nimpact is sufficient to state a § 2 vote denial case.

Whether a claim of mere disproportionality alone\nsupports a \"resulting\" claim is not clear under § 2 and is a\ndifficult question we need not reach.\n\n                                          -22-\n\fstructure, history, and constitutional concerns is particularly\n\ntrue of the VRA, a complex statute with an extensive legislative\n\nhistory and caselaw.

The purposes and congressional history of\n\nthe 1982 amendments, as well as congressional action after 1982,\n\nfurther confirm our understanding that § 2 does not encompass this\n\nclaim.\n\n          1.          The Original VRA of 1965\n\n          The original VRA was enacted against the background of\n\nexplicit constitutional and congressional11 approval of state felon\n\ndisenfranchisement laws and expressed no intention to invalidate\n\nsuch laws, but rather an intention to leave such laws untouched.\n\n          Prior to the enactment of the VRA, enforcement of the\n\nFifteenth Amendment guarantee that the \"right of citizens of the\n\nUnited States to vote shall not be denied or abridged . . . on\n\naccount of race, color, or previous condition of servitude,\" U.S.\n\nConst. amend.

Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301, 308\n\n(1966).    Plaintiffs' claim here concededly does not involve any\n\nsuch intent.     The language of the original § 2 \"tracked . . . the\n\ntext of the Fifteenth Amendment,\"             Bartlett, 129 S.

The VRA's original object was plainly\n\nto combat specific forms of racial discrimination.12                Beyond § 2,\n\nthe remainder of the VRA set up a scheme of stringent remedies to\n\naddress    the   most     flagrant    practices.        \"[T]he    Act   directly\n\npre-empted the most powerful tools of black disenfranchisement in\n\nthe   covered    areas.

In\n\nfact, Congress explicitly considered the effect of the VRA on\n\nstate felon disenfranchisement laws, and did so under § 4, rather\n\nthan under § 2.13    Section 4 of the VRA bans any \"test or device\"\n\nthat impermissibly limits the franchise.               42 U.S.C. § 1973b(c).\n\nCongress, in enacting § 4(c) proscribed several categories of\n\nhistorically    discriminatory     tests     or    devices,    including      some\n\nliteracy tests, educational achievement or knowledge tests, and\n\ngood moral character qualifications.          But Congress was careful to\n\ncarve out from its proscription of tests for good moral character\n\nany and all state felon disenfranchisement laws.                H.R. Rep. No.\n\n89-439 (1965), reprinted in 1965 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2437, 2547-57.                   In\n\nexcluding felon disenfranchisement laws from the scope of § 4,\n\nCongress took the view that it did not consider such laws to be a\n\ndiscriminatory      voter    qualification        or   a   \"tool[]    of   black\n\ndisenfranchisement.\"        Nw.

It\n\nstated that the VRA \"does not proscribe a requirement of a State\n\nor any political subdivision of a State that an applicant for\n\nvoting or registration for voting be free of conviction of a\n\nfelony or mental disability.\"           H.R. Rep. No. 89-439, reprinted in\n\n1965 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2457.\n\n           In    drafting      the      VRA,    Congress    considered      felon\n\ndisenfranchisement statutes, and it viewed them as a potential\n\ntest or device that fell within the purview of § 4 and not § 2.\n\nWe are not free to second guess Congress's categorizations of\n\nfelon disenfranchisement statutes.             Further, Congress made clear\n\nthat it did not purport to outlaw state felon disenfranchisement\n\nstatutes based on their effect.                Rather, under § 4, Congress\n\nenumerated      and   outlawed       tests     or   devices    it    viewed    as\n\ndisqualifications         excluding            minority       voters.       Felon\n\ndisenfranchisement      laws     were    specifically      removed   from     this\n\ncategory by Congress and were considered nondiscriminatory.\n\n           In light of this express history, Congress could not have\n\nintended to create a cause of action under § 2 of the VRA against\n\ndisenfranchisement of incarcerated felons while saying explicitly\n\n\n                                        -27-\n\felsewhere that it did not intend to proscribe any such laws.\n\nOther courts agree with our conclusion.         Hayden, 449 F.3d at 319\n\n(\"[I]t is apparent to us that Congress's effort to highlight the\n\nexclusion of felon disenfranchisement laws from a VRA provision\n\nthat otherwise would likely be read to invalidate such laws is\n\nindicative of its broader intention to exclude such laws from the\n\nreach of the statute.\"); see also Farrakhan, 359 F.3d at 1120-21\n\n(Kozinski, J., dissenting from denial of reh'g en banc).\n\n            This point is buttressed by another aspect of § 4.        As\n\ndrafted in 1965, § 4 applied to covered jurisdictions.14         Congress\n\nwould not have permitted felon disenfranchisement laws in covered\n\njurisdictions where there was a history of discrimination, while\n\nprohibiting them in non-covered jurisdictions like Massachusetts.\n\nTo subject felon disenfranchisement in a non-covered jurisdiction\n\nto a VRA cause of action while prohibiting such a cause of action\n\nfor    a   covered   jurisdiction    would   itself   raise   significant\n\nconstitutional concerns.     See    Nw. Austin, 2009 WL 1738645, at *9.\n\n            If there were any doubt as to Congress's intent not to\n\ncreate a cause of action against laws like Article 120, other\n\n      14\n        Congress continued to revisit the discriminatory tests or\ndevices banned by § 4. Later VRA amendments extended the § 4 ban\non literacy tests nationwide. See Voting Rights Act Amendments of\n1970, Pub. L. No. 91-285, § 201, 84 Stat. 314, 315 (current version\nat 42 U.S.C. § 1973aa) (extending temporary ban to entire nation);\nVoting Rights Act Amendments of 1975, Pub. L.

Congress never\nchanged its view that felon disenfranchisement laws were not within\nthe reach of the VRA.\n\n                                    -28-\n\factions        show    congressional        acceptance      of    even       broader   felon\n\ndisenfranchisement           laws     than    involved      here,       reinforcing        the\n\nconclusion that § 2 was not meant to proscribe laws such as\n\nArticle 120.            In 1971, just six years after passing the VRA,\n\nCongress affirmatively enacted a broader felon disenfranchisement\n\nstatute        covering     both    imprisoned       and    paroled      felons       in   the\n\nDistrict of Columbia, over which it then exercised plenary power.\n\nAct of Dec. 23, 1971, Pub. L. No. 92-220, § 4, 85 Stat. 788, 788;\n\nsee also Hayden, 449 F.3d at 315.                          Congress would not have\n\nprohibited states from imposing such disqualifications when it\n\nimposed them itself on the District.\n\n               Further, between the passage of the VRA in 1965 and the\n\n1982 amendments, Congress considered and rejected proposals to\n\namend        the    VRA15   to    prohibit     certain      types       of    state    felon\n\ndisenfranchisement laws.                  Congress understood that the VRA, as\n\nenacted       in    1965,   did     not    permit    claims      against       state   felon\n\ndisenfranchisement laws and that amendment of the VRA would be\n\nneeded to permit such suits, and it declined to                                 make those\n\namendments.           Two points are important.            First, Congress rejected\n\neach        those   proposed      amendments.       Second,      even    those    rejected\n\namendments          would    have     precluded       suits      raising        claims      of\n\n       15\n         The 1975 Amendments to the VRA added protections for\nlinguistic minorities and permanently banned literacy tests. 1975\nAmendments §§ 203, 207, 89 Stat. at 401-02 (codified as amended at\n42 U.S.C. §§ 1973b(f), 1973l(c)(3)). Nothing in those amendments\nindicated any intent to broaden the VRA to permit suits against\nstate laws disenfranchising incarcerated felons.\n\n                                             -29-\n\fdisenfranchisement        of    a    \"citizen       [who]   is    confined      in     a\n\ncorrectional facility at the time of such . . . election,\" as does\n\nArticle 120 now at issue.           See Ex-Offenders Voting Rights: Hearing\n\non H.R. 9020 Before the Subcomm. on Courts, Civil Liberties, and\n\nthe Administration of Justice of the H. Comm. on the Judiciary,\n\n93d Cong. 4 (1974).\n\n             In 1972, the House Judiciary Committee held hearings on\n\n\"The Problems of the Ex-Offender.\"                  See Corrections, Part VI,\n\nIllinois: The Problems of the Ex-Offender: Hearing Before Subcomm.\n\nNo. 3 of the H.

In\n\nresponse to these hearings, several prominent VRA advocates in\n\nCongress jointly introduced a bill designed \"to amend the [VRA] to\n\nprohibit the States from denying the right to vote in Federal\n\nelections to former criminal offenders who have not been convicted\n\nof any offense related to voting or elections and who are not\n\nconfined in a correctional institution.\"               Hayden, 449 F.3d at 319\n\n(emphasis added) (quoting H.R. 15,049, 92d Cong.

The bill did not result in legislation.\n\nId.\n\n             Similarly,      Congress    held   hearings     in   1973   expressly\n\naddressing but not adopting proposed amendments to the VRA to\n\nallow      challenges   to     felon    disenfranchisement        for    only    that\n\ncategory      of   ex-offenders        who   were     not   imprisoned.16            See\n\n      16\n        The proposed amendment would have authorized \"the Attorney\nGeneral . . . to institute in the name of the United States such\n\n                                        -30-\n\fEx-Offenders Voting Rights: Hearing on H.R. 9020, supra, 93d Cong.\n\n1-38; see also Hayden, 449 F.3d at 319.\n\n            Plaintiffs' claim that § 2 as drafted in 1965 permits a\n\ncause of action against Article 120 fails.\n\n            2.

(1973)).\n     17\n         Under Supreme Court and circuit precedent, we read both §\n2(a) and § 2(b) together and resort to legislative history. The\ntext of § 2(b) is explicit that its purpose is to give content and\ncontext to the terms used in § 2(a).       The Supreme Court has\ninterpreted both sections together. See Bartlett, 129 S. Ct. at\n1241 (\"The 1982 amendments . . . added . . . § 2(b), providing a\ntest for determining whether a § 2 violation has occurred.\");\nChisom, 501 U.S. at 395 (\"The two purposes of the amendment [to\n§ 2] are apparent from its text. Section (a) adopts a results test\n. . . . Section (b) provides guidance about how the results test\nis to be applied.\").\n        This court's precedent also requires we read §§ 2(a) and\n2(b) together and in light of history and context. See Metts, 363\nF.3d at 10 (\"The Delphic language of the [1982] amendment [to § 2]\ncan be understood only against the background of its legislative\nhistory and subsequent Supreme Court interpretation.\").\n\n                                 -31-\n\f          The 1982 amendments did not alter the prior understanding\n\nthat the VRA did not reach the disenfranchisement of currently\n\nincarcerated   felons.         When   \"Congress    adopts     a   new    law\n\nincorporating sections of a prior law, Congress normally can be\n\npresumed to have had knowledge of the [administrative or judicial]\n\ninterpretation given to the incorporated law, at least insofar as\n\nit affects the new statute.\"     Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U.S. 575, 581\n\n(1978).   Nothing in the text, context,18 or history supports\n\nplaintiffs' position.\n\n          The Supreme Court held that \"Congress amended § 2 of the\n\nVRA to make clear that certain practices and procedures that\n\nresult in the denial or abridgement of the right to vote are\n\nforbidden even though the absence of proof of discriminatory\n\nintent protects them from constitutional challenge.\"          Chisom, 501\n\nU.S. at 383-84 (emphasis added); Johnson, 405 F.3d at 1228.             Felon\n\ndisqualification   was   not    among    those   certain    practices    and\n\nprocedures.\n\n\n     18\n           The context of the 1982 amendments confirms our\nunderstanding that § 2 was not amended in isolation from the rest\nof the statute and must be read in conjunction with the other\nsections, including § 4. The 1982 amendments to § 2 arose in the\nwake of Bolden because § 5 of the VRA was scheduled for\nreauthorization in that year by the terms of the 1975 VRA\namendments. S. Issacharoff et al., The Law of Democracy 713-14\n(rev. 2d ed. 2002). Indeed, in the House, most debate focused on\nthe structure of the preclearance and bailout provisions of the\nVRA, while less attention focused on the § 2 amendments. Id. at\n716; see also T.M. Boyd & S.J. Markman, The 1982 Amendments to the\nVoting Rights Act: A Legislative History, 40 Wash. & Lee L.

We\n\nexplain.    Prior to Bolden, in White v. Regester, 412 U.S. 755\n\n(1973), minority plaintiffs had successfully challenged a state\n\ndistricting plan on vote dilution grounds.          There, the Court did\n\nnot require a showing of discriminatory intent.         See id. at 766.\n\nBy contrast, the Bolden plurality held that state action \"that is\n\nracially neutral on its face violates the Fifteenth Amendment only\n\nif motivated by a discriminatory purpose,\" 446 U.S. at 61, and\n\naltered the White evidentiary standard in vote dilution cases to\n\n\n\n\n    19\n          Congress was clear about its intent.        The Senate Report\nstates:\n           This Amendment is designed to make clear that\n           proof of discriminatory intent is not required\n           to establish a violation of Section 2. It\n           thereby restores the legal standards, based on\n           the controlling Supreme Court precedents,\n           which applied in voting discrimination claims\n           prior to the litigation involved in Mobile v.\n           Bolden. The amendment also adds a new\n           subsection to Section 2 which delineates the\n           legal standards under the results test by\n           codifying the leading pre-Bolden vote dilution\n           case, White v. Regester.See S. Rep.

Ct. at 1240-41.\n\n           In 1982, Congress focused on reversing this aspect of\n\nBolden and clarifying the standard for vote dilution claims.\n\nCongress aimed to reinstate the \"results test,\" which had been the\n\nrule developed in the pre-Bolden case law for vote dilution claims\n\nunder    White.    See   Metts,   363   F.3d   at   10   (stating    the   1982\n\namendments made it clear that \"discriminatory intent is not a\n\nnecessary element in a violation and that Congress [instead]\n\nintended a broad range of factors to be taken into account\").                But\n\nthe reinstated, multifactored results test was not meant to extend\n\nto this limited felon disenfranchisement claim any more than the\n\npre-Bolden tests were.         Nothing in the legislative history of\n\n§ 2(b) indicated any intent to expand the VRA to create a cause of\n\naction   against   a   state   felon    disenfranchisement     law    such   as\n\nArticle 120.      To the contrary, in enacting § 2, Congress noted\n\nthat it was impossible to predict the variety of means that would\n\nbe used to infringe on the right to vote and that the voting\n\nrights landscape was marked by innovation in discrimination.                  S.\n\nRep. No. 89-162, at 5 (1965); S. Rep. No. 89-439, at 10.                     But\n\nthese concerns do not go to felon disenfranchisement, which was\n\n\n    20\n        The Bolden plurality also held that the \"language of § 2\n[of the VRA] no more than elaborates upon that of the Fifteenth\nAmendment, and the sparse legislative history of § 2 makes clear\nthat it was intended to have an effect no different from that of\nthe Fifteenth Amendment itself.\" 446 U.S. at 61.\n\n                                   -34-\n\f neither a new innovation nor a predictable future innovation.\n\n Felon disenfranchisement was a well-known and accepted part of the\n\n voting     landscape.         \"The   Senate   Report,   which    details     many\n\n discriminatory techniques used by certain jurisdictions, made no\n\n mention of felon disenfranchisement provisions.\"                     Johnson, 405\n\n F.3d at 1234; see also Tokaji, supra, at 707 (\"The legislative\n\n history of the 1982 amendments thus shows that Congress was almost\n\n exclusively focused on vote dilution claims.\").21\n\n             Further, the language of § 2(b) undercuts plaintiffs'\n\nassertion they have stated a claim under § 2(a).                      The text of\n\nsubsection (b) protects a \"class of citizens\" who by law may and\n\nshould enjoy as full an \"opportunity [as] other members of the\n\nelectorate to participate in the political process.\"                    § 1973(b).\n\nFor   a    host   of   valid    reasons,    incarcerated      prisoners      cannot\n\nparticipate in the political process equally with free citizens\n\noutside the prison walls.             Hayden, 449 F.3d at 342 (Jacobs, J.,\n\nconcurring).       As noted by Hayden, \"There is no question that\n\nincarcerated persons cannot 'fully participate in the political\n\nprocess' -- they cannot petition, protest, campaign, travel, freely\n\nassociate, or raise funds.\"           Id. at 321.\n\n             Further,    the     1982   Congress    amended   §   2    to   assuage\n\nexpressed fears that the courts would interpret a results test as\n\n      21\n         We need not reach the question of whether this amendment\nwas meant to reach other types of § 2 claims than vote dilution\nclaims; even if so, the amendments were not meant to create a cause\nof action against imprisoned felon disenfranchisement laws.\n\n                                        -35-\n\fa requirement for proportional representation in vote dilution\n\ncases, and therefore the statute was amended to expressly disclaim\n\nany right to proportional representation.                 § 1973(b) (\"[N]othing in\n\nthis section establishes a right to have members of a protected\n\nclass    elected       in   numbers      equal    to    their     proportion        in    the\n\npopulation.\");          Tokaji, supra, at 705-06.                 This suggests that\n\nCongress was fundamentally concerned with remedying discrimination\n\nin voting, rather than guaranteeing proportionality in political\n\nrepresentation. See, e.g., S. Issacharoff, Polarized Voting and the\n\nPolitical Process, 90 Mich. L. Rev. 1833 (1992). Plaintiffs' claim,\n\nwhich is based on mere disproportionality in the prison population\n\nfrom felon disenfranchisement, does not implicate these concerns.\n\n            3.              Post-1982 Congressional Actions Assume the\n                            Validity   of   State   and  Federal  Felon\n                            Disenfranchisement Laws\n\n            Congressional           action,      both    after    1982       and    in    the\n\naftermath of Bush v. Gore, also undercuts the plaintiffs' reading\n\nof the amended § 2 to support a claim against imprisoned felon\n\ndisenfranchisement          laws.         These        statutes       show     continuing\n\ncongressional approval of state laws disenfranchising imprisoned\n\nfelons.     The    National      Voter     Registration         Act    of    1993,       which\n\ngenerally restricts states' ability to remove names from the voter\n\nrolls,    explicitly        exempts      state    decisions       to     disenfranchise\n\nindividuals      \"by    reason      of   criminal       conviction.\"           42    U.S.C.\n\n§ 1973gg-6(a)(3)(B).          The Help America Vote Act of 2002 directs\n\n\n\n                                          -36-\n\fstates to remove disenfranchised felons from their lists of those\n\neligible   to    vote     in     federal       elections.           42    U.S.C.\n\n§ 15483(a)(2)(A)(ii)(I).       These two recent statutes are entirely\n\ninconsistent with reading § 2, whatever its breadth, to create a\n\ncause of action against Article 120.\n\n           Further, Congress has continued to consider and reject\n\nnumerous proposals to require states to enfranchise even former\n\nfelons.    Even these efforts have expressly excluded currently\n\nincarcerated    felons.        See,    e.g.,        Civic   Participation      and\n\nRehabilitation Act of 1999: Hearing on H.R. 906 Before the Subcomm.\n\non the Constitution of the H. Comm. on the Judiciary, 106th Cong.\n\n1, 3 (2000) (quoting H.R. 906, 106th Cong. (1999)).22\n\n           Congress     has    excepted      from    the    reach   of   the   VRA\n\nprotections from vote denial for claims against a state which\n\ndisenfranchises incarcerated felons.            We do not need to decide23\n\n     22\n        The Civic Participation and Rehabilitation Act would have\nrestored the voting rights of ex-felons, but not imprisoned felons,\nin federal elections. H.R. 906 was not drafted as an amendment to\nthe VRA, but contained a savings clause clarifying that the measure\noperated in addition the VRA and the National Voter Registration\nAct. Civic Participation and Rehabilitation Act of 1999: Hearing\non H.R. 906, supra, at 4. A number of recent unsuccessful bills\nare consistent with H.R. 906's proposal to restore the rights of\nonly former felons. And even these have been flatly rejected by\nCongress. See, e.g., Democracy Restoration Act of 2008, S. 3640,\n110th Cong. (2008); Democracy Restoration Act of 2008, H.R. 7136,\n110th Cong. (2008); Count Every Vote Act of 2005, S. 450, 109th\nCong. (2005); Ex-Offenders Voting Rights Act of 2005, H.R. 663,\n109th Cong. (2005).\n     23\n         It is doubtful plaintiffs have articulated a viable § 2\ndirect denial theory, in any event. Plaintiffs have explained only\nthat they think this claim falls within a broad reading of § 2,\n\n                                      -37-\n\fwhat is needed to prove a denial (as opposed to a dilution) claim\n\nunder        §   2   which   is   not   a   claim   against   a   state   provision\n\ndisenfranchising imprisoned felons.24\n\n\nprovided one ignores the text of § 4, the legislative history of\nthe Act, and the purpose and context of § 2(b). But they have not\nexplained even what their theory of liability is, what standards a\ncourt would apply, or what the components of a winning claim would\nbe. This is the situation eight years after they filed suit and\nhave had discovery from defendants.\n       The most plaintiffs have suggested is that despite the self-\nevident racial neutrality of depriving all incarcerated felons from\nvoting while imprisoned, there may be some causal connection\nbetween being incarcerated for felonies and their race. But the\nvery 1994 Commission Report on which they rely concludes that no\nsuch connection was shown. More than that, it concluded that if\none wished to see if such a connection could be shown, the data\nsimply did not exist to permit the testing of the hypothesis. When\nplaintiffs asked the defendant officials in discovery for data\nwhich would presumably assist them, the defendants said they did\nnot have and did not keep such data.\n      There is nothing else. Even if one were to look more broadly\nat the Senate factors so often used in vote dilution cases, see S.\nRep. No. 97-417, at 28-29 (1982), reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N.\n177, 206-07, those factors do not aid plaintiffs.\n      Further, given our disposition of the case, we need not reach\nthe concerns raised by Judge Kozinski about the role of evidence of\nstatistical disparities in § 2 challenges. Farrakhan, 359 F.3d at\n1119 (Kozinski, J. dissenting from denial of reh'g en banc); see\nalso Ricci v. DeStefano, No. 07-1428, --- S.Ct. ----, 2009 WL\n1835138, at *19 (June 29, 2009) (reliance on threshold showing of\na raw statistical disparity in test results is not strong evidence\nof disparate impact).\n        24\n        Some have commented on a \"potential tension in the case law\n[because] . . . section 2 [from 1982 onward] had been used almost\nentirely   for   vote   dilution   claims   [while]   [t]he   felon\ndisenfranchisement cases involve an older kind of claim involving\naccess to the ballot itself; such cases involve not vote dilution\nbut vote denial.\" S. Issacharoff et al., The Law of Democracy 140\n(rev. 2d ed. Supp. 2006); see Tokaji, supra, at 709 (\"While Gingles\nand its progeny have generated a well-established standard for vote\ndilution, a satisfactory test for vote denial cases under Section\n2 has yet to emerge. . . .

While our emphasis\n\nis somewhat different, we agree with the Second Circuit in Hayden\n\nthat the seven circumstances it identifies all necessitate the\n\nconclusion that the this claim is not actionable.           449 F.3d at 315-\n\n16.\n\n           Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim under VRA § 2.\n\nWe have no need to reach the serious constitutional questions which\n\nthe Commonwealth argues would be raised were we to adopt plaintiffs'\n\nconstruction of the statute.

There are no material facts in dispute\n\nin the record.\n\n           Plaintiffs argue the Ex Post Facto Clause was violated\n\nbecause \"the only plainly discernible purpose for Article 120 was\n\nto seek to impose an additional measure of punishment upon those who\n\nhad violated the laws of the Commonwealth.\" Plaintiffs point to the\n\na transcript of the debates at the 1998 and 2000 Constitutional\n\nConventions over the bill that ultimately became Article 120.\n\nPlaintiffs also rely on language from Acting Governor Cellucci's\n\nproposed amendment and his statements to the public, an amendment\n\nwhich was not accepted.         These statements include: \"The time has\n\ncome to tell would-be criminals in Massachusetts that committing\n\ncrimes has serious consequences,\" and that \"[p]risons are a place\n\nfor punishment.\"      Even though his initial proposal was never in\n\nfact acted on by the legislature, we consider his comments as part\n\nof the background.\n\n           Analysis of the Ex Post Facto Clause claim involves a\n\ntwo-part inquiry.    The first asks whether the denial of the right\n\nto vote is a civil, regulatory measure within the meaning of the\n\ncaselaw,   or    whether   it     is    punitive.   \"[W]here   unpleasant\n\n\n                                       -40-\n\fconsequences are brought to bear upon an individual for prior\n\nconduct,\" the central question \"is whether the legislative aim was\n\nto   punish   that     individual   for    past   activity,   or    whether   the\n\nrestriction of the individual comes about as a relevant incident to\n\na regulation of a present situation.\" De Veau v. Braisted, 363 U.S.\n\n144,   160    (1960)    (holding    that    state    statutory     bans   against\n\nemployment of convicted felons in certain jobs did not impose\n\npunishment under Ex Post Facto Clause). Only a punitive measure can\n\nviolate the Ex Post Facto Clause. See, e.g., Smith v. Doe, 538 U.S.\n\n84, 92 (2003); see also United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739\n\n(1987) (holding preventative detention under the Bail Reform Act was\n\npermissible because it was regulatory and preventative, rather than\n\npunitive).\n\n              The      Supreme       Court          has stated that felon\n\ndisenfranchisement provisions are considered regulatory rather then\n\npunitive.      In Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86 (1958), the Court\n\nexplained:\n\n              [A] statute has been considered nonpenal if it\n              imposes a disability, not to punish, but to\n              accomplish some other legitimate governmental\n              purpose. . . . The point may be illustrated by\n              the situation of an ordinary felon. A person\n              who commits a bank robbery, for instance,\n              loses his right to liberty and often his right\n              to vote. If, in the exercise of the power to\n              protect banks, both sanctions were imposed for\n              the purpose of punishing bank robbers, the\n              statutes authorizing both disabilities would\n              be penal.    But because the purpose of the\n              latter statute is to designate a reasonable\n              ground of eligibility for voting, this law is\n\n\n                                      -41-\n\f           sustained as a nonpenal exercise of the power\n           to regulate the franchise.\n\nId. at 96-97; see also Lassiter v. N. Hampton County Bd. of\n\nElections, 360 U.S. 45, 51 (1959) (criminal record is an \"obvious\"\n\nfactor that \"a State may take into consideration in determining the\n\nqualifications of voters\").   Article 120 is no exception.\n\n           Even if the Supreme Court had not already described such\n\nregulation of the franchise with respect to incarcerated felons as\n\nnonpenal, we would still find Article 120 to be a civil regulatory\n\nscheme.   In examining Article 120 \"on its face,\" Hudson v. United\n\nStates, 522 U.S. 93, 100 (1997), there is no language indicating the\n\nCommonwealth's provision is penal.     Article 120 is not in the\n\nCommonwealth's criminal code, but rather its civil constitutional\n\nand statutory voter qualification provisions.    See Hendricks, 521\n\nU.S. at 361, (\"[The State's] objective to create a civil proceeding\n\nis evidenced by its placement of the Act within the [State's]\n\nprobate code, instead of the criminal code\" (citations omitted)).\n\nArticle 120 also disenfranchises persons under guardianship, persons\n\ndisqualified because of corrupt elections practices, and all persons\n\nunder eighteen years of age, as well as incarcerated felons.    And\n\nthe disqualification is enforced civilly, not criminally.\n\n           Article 120 does not involve a more general period of\n\ndisenfranchisement because of commission of a felony; rather Article\n\n120 is limited to the period of incarceration.     Article 120 thus\n\ncreates a temporary qualification on the right to vote coincident\n\n\n                               -42-\n\fwith imprisonment, rather than a long-term consequence for the\n\ncommission of a crime.\n\n            Article 120 is a constitutional amendment, which was\n\nlater   effectuated     and   extended    by   statute.      The   voters    of\n\nMassachusetts ratified Article 120 in a statewide election.                 The\n\nVoter Guide read by the voters, which we described earlier, made no\n\nmention of any goal of punishing prisoners. \"The Ex Post Facto\n\nClause does not preclude a State from making reasonable categorical\n\njudgments    that    conviction   of   specified    crimes      should   entail\n\nparticular regulatory consequences.\"           Smith, 538 U.S. at 1153.\n\n            Secondly, even if the legislature intended to deem a\n\nparticular law \"civil,\" courts must further inquire whether \"the\n\nstatutory scheme was so punitive either in purpose or effect as to\n\nnegate that intention.\" United States v. Ward, 448 U.S. 242, 248-49\n\n(1980).     \"'[O]nly the clearest proof' will suffice to override\n\nlegislative intent and transform what has been denominated a civil\n\nremedy into a criminal penalty.\"         Hudson, 522 U.S. at 100 (quoting\n\nWard, 448 U.S. at 249).       Plaintiffs fail to meet this standard.\n\n            We review whether plaintiffs' allegations of punitive\n\npurpose meet the non-exclusive factors test set forth in Kennedy v.\n\nMendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. 144, 168-69 (1963), and followed in\n\nSmith, 538 U.S. at 97.\n\n            The     Mendoza-Martinez     factors   are:   (1)    whether    the\n\nsanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint; (2)\n\n\n\n                                   -43-\n\fwhether it has historically been regarded as punishment; (3) whether\n\nit comes into play only on a finding of scienter; (4) whether its\n\noperation   will   promote   the   traditional    aims     of   punishment   --\n\nretribution and deterrence; (5) whether the behavior to which it\n\napplies is already a crime; (6) whether there is a rational\n\nconnection to a nonpunitive purpose; and (7) whether it appears\n\nexcessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned. Mendoza-\n\nMartinez, 372 U.S. at 168-69. The most relevant factors are whether\n\nfelon disenfranchisement \"has been regarded in our history and\n\ntraditions as a punishment; imposes an affirmative disability or\n\nrestraint; promotes the traditional aims of punishment; has a\n\nrational connection to a nonpunitive purpose; or is excessive with\n\nrespect to this purpose.\"      Smith, 538 U.S. at 97.\n\n            First,   Article   120   does   not   impose    any   affirmative\n\ndisability or restraint, physical or otherwise. See Smith, 538 U.S.\n\nat 100 (\"[I]mprisonment . . . is the paradigmatic affirmative\n\ndisability or restraint.\").        Disenfranchisement during the period\n\nof incarceration imposes no additional term of imprisonment, see\n\nFlemming v. Nestor, 363 U.S. 603, 617 (1960), and is not as enduring\n\nas permanent occupational debarment, which the Court has held is\n\nnonpunitive.   Hudson, 522 U.S. at 104; De Veau, 363 U.S. at 144;\n\nHawker v. New York, 170 U.S. 189 (1898) (revocation of a medical\n\nlicense does not violate Ex Post Facto clause).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -44-\n\f             Second, felon disenfranchisement has historically not\n\nbeen regarded as punitive in the United States, as the Supreme Court\n\nindicated    in   Trop    v.      Dulles.    Indeed,      in   holding       that    felon\n\ndisenfranchisement       has      \"affirmative     sanction\"      in     §    2     of    the\n\nFourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, Richardson, 418 U.S.\n\nat 54, the Supreme Court noted the historical prevalence of state\n\nfelon   disenfranchisement           laws    and     never     characterized             even\n\nCalifornia's broad disqualification of former felons as punitive.\n\nId. at 55.\n\n             As   to   the     third   and   fifth     factors,       Article       120   is\n\neffective regardless of a finding of scienter or the type of crime\n\nso long as it is a felony.              That Article 120 may be \"tied to\n\ncriminal    activity\"        is   \"insufficient      to      render    the    statut[e]\n\npunitive.\"    United States v. Ursery, 518 U.S. 267, 291 (1996).\n\n             The fourth Mendoza-Martinez factor considers whether\n\nfelon disenfranchisement will promote                  the     traditional aims of\n\npunishment, retribution and deterrence, to see whether plaintiffs\n\nhave offered the clearest proof to overcome the statement of\n\nnonpenal purpose.        Plaintiffs rely on some statements made by some\n\nlegislators that could be viewed as retributive, such as that felons\n\n\"don't deserve to vote.\"           To the extent the legislators' comments\n\nare   relevant, they are sporadic and do not clearly evince a\n\nretributive purpose.         More significantly, since Article 120 was put\n\nbefore the voters, the Information for Voters Guide is a better\n\n\n                                        -45-\n\fsource of context.   The Guide contained a balanced debate about the\n\nmerits of allowing currently incarcerated felons to vote in state\n\nelections, noted the problem of prisoners being able to affect the\n\nlaws under which they were confined by voting, and nowhere suggests\n\nan intent to punish prisoners.\n\n          As to the sixth factor, there is an obvious rational\n\nnonpunitive purpose for disenfranchisement:     as the Guide shows,\n\nvoters were concerned about the influence of currently incarcerated\n\nfelons in \"exercis[ing] control over [their] lives by voting from\n\nprison.\" See also Smith, 538 U.S. at 1147 (noting that \"even if the\n\nobjective of the Act is consistent with the purposes of the [state]\n\ncriminal justice system, the State's pursuit of it in a regulatory\n\nscheme does not make the objective punitive.\").     Finally, Article\n\n120 is not excessive in accomplishing this purpose.     Article 120\n\ndoes not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause.\n\n                                 IV.\n\n          The entry of judgment against the plaintiffs' Ex Post\n\nFacto Clause claim is affirmed; the court's denial of the motion to\n\ndismiss the VRA claim is reversed and the case is remanded to the\n\ndistrict court for dismissal of both claims with prejudice.     Each\n\nside shall bear its own costs.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n                     -Dissenting Opinion Follows-\n\n\n                                 -46-\n\f             TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge (Dissenting). Lest we be misled\n\nby the majority's choice of emphasis, this is not a case about the\n\nstate's authority to disenfranchise convicted felons, nor about the\n\npopularity or desirability of that practice.      Were that the issue\n\nbefore us, I too would be in the majority, as the validity of felon\n\ndisenfranchisement laws, as a general matter, has been established.\n\nSee Richardson v. Ramirez, 418 U.S. 24, 56 (1974).     Moreover, were\n\nthat the issue before us, it would not have spawned reams of\n\nconflicting opinions, vigorous dissents and en banc reversals among\n\nour sister circuits.25\n\n             Rather this is a case about interpreting a clearly worded\n\ncongressional statute, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (\"VRA\"),\n\naccording to its terms, when there is no persuasive reason to do\n\notherwise.

Plaintiffs allege that this disparate impact is caused,\n\nin part, by racial and ethnic bias in the Massachusetts court\n\nsystem, and operates to deny these racial minorities the right to\n\nvote, in violation of § 2 of the VRA.             Plaintiffs further allege\n\n\n\n     26\n         Among the non-exhaustive factors listed by the Senate as\nrelevant to assessing the validity of a voter qualification is \"the\nextent to which members of the minority group in the state or\npolitical subdivision bear the effects of discrimination in such\nareas as education, employment and health, which hinder their\nability to participate effectively in the political process.\" S.\nRep. No. 94-417, at 29 (1982), as reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N.\n177, 207. The ultimate inquiry, according to the Senate Report is\n\"whether, in the particular situation, the practice operated to\ndeny the minority plaintiff an equal opportunity to participate and\nto elect candidates of their [sic] choice.\" Id. at 30. The Ninth\nCircuit, applying this test, has explicitly held that evidence of\nracial bias in the criminal justice system is a relevant \"social\nand historical condition\" for purposes of the totality of the\ncircumstances test, reasoning that \"such discrimination would\nclearly hinder the ability of racial minorities to participate\neffectively in the political process as disenfranchisement is\nautomatic.\" Farrakhan, 338 F.3d at 1020; see also Nipper v. Smith,\n39 F.3d 1494, 1513-14 (11th Cir. 1994) (en banc) (holding that the\nexistence of racial bias in the community is relevant to a § 2\nclaim). \"Thus, racial bias in the criminal justice system may very\nwell interact with voter disqualifications to create the kinds of\nbarriers to political participation on account of race that are\nprohibited by Section 2.\" Farrakhan, 338 F.3d at 1020.\n\n                                    -49-\n\fthat when enacting Article 120, Massachusetts legislators were aware\n\nof the data regarding racial bias in the criminal justice system.27\n\n            The    felon   disenfranchisement     provision     at   issue   is\n\nclearly a \"voting qualification.\"           Whether or not this provision\n\nresults in the denial of the right to vote \"on account of race or\n\ncolor\"    under   the   \"totality   of   the   circumstances\"   remains      the\n\nultimate question for the trier of fact.           But \"[e]ven if serious\n\nproblems lie ahead in applying the 'totality of the circumstances\n\nstandard described in [VRA] § 2(b), that task, difficult as it may\n\nprove to be, cannot justify a judicially created limitation on the\n\ncoverage of the broadly worded statute, as enacted and amended by\n\nCongress.\" Chisom, 501 U.S. at 403. Plaintiffs have stated a claim\n\nsufficient to preclude dismissal at this preliminary stage and are\n\nentitled to the opportunity to develop it.\n\n            In order to avoid this obvious result, the majority makes\n\nan expansive and unwarranted holding.           It holds that despite the\n\nbroad language of VRA § 2, covering all \"voting qualifications,\"\n\nCongress actually never intended for felon disenfranchisement laws,\n\neven discriminatory ones, to be challengeable under that provision.\n\n     27\n          Notably, bearing on the question of plausibility of\nplaintiffs' claim, one scholar has found that an analysis of the\nfactors   inducing    states   to   impose   or   eliminate   felon\ndisenfranchisement provisions concluded that \"[s]tates with greater\nnonwhite prison populations have been more likely to ban convicted\nfelons from voting than states with proportionally fewer non-whites\nin the criminal justice system.\" Angela Behrens, et al., Ballot\nManipulation and the \"Menace of Negro Domination\": Racial Threat\nand Felon Disenfranchisement in the United States, 1850-2002, 109\nAm.

See Robinson v. Shell\n\nOil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 340 (1997) (\"Our first step in interpreting\n\na statute is to determine whether the language at issue has a plain\n\nand unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the\n\ncase.\"    (emphasis       added)).      The   plain    language     of    §     2(a)\n\nunambiguously applies to all \"voting qualifications.\"                42 U.S.C. §\n\n1973.    A provision disqualifying incarcerated felons, listed among\n\nthe     provisions    of    the   Massachusetts       Constitution       governing\n\nqualifications       to     vote,      clearly    constitutes        a     \"voting\n\nqualification.\"      Therefore, where it is alleged, as here, that this\n\n\"qualification\" is being applied \"in a manner which results\" in the\n\ndenial of the right to vote on account of race, a cognizable VRA\n\n\n\n                                       -51-\n\fclaim        has    been   stated.    Id.       As   the   text   of   the    statute\n\nunambiguously manifests its meaning, there was no need to go any\n\nfurther       in     order   to   conclude   that    plaintiffs    have      stated   a\n\ncognizable claim under § 2 of the VRA.\n\n                   This is the reasoning upon which the Ninth Circuit\n\ndecision, holding that an identical VRA claim had been stated in\n\nthat Circuit, starts and ends.               See Farrakhan, 338 F.3d at 1016\n\n(\"Plaintiff's claim of vote denial [resulting from Washington's\n\nfelon disenfranchisement law] is cognizable under Section 2 of the\n\nVRA\" because '[f]elon disenfranchisement is a voting qualification,\n\nand Section 2 is clear that any voting qualification that denies\n\ncitizens the right to vote in a discriminatory manner violates the\n\nVRA (emphasis added)).\"28 As Judge Sotomayor similarly explained in\n\nher powerful dissenting opinion in Hayden:\n\n                   It is plain to anyone reading the Voting\n                   Rights Act that it applies to all 'voting\n                   qualifications.' And it is equally plain that\n                   [the felon disenfranchisement provision at\n                   issue] disqualifies a group of people from\n                   voting.     These two propositions should\n                   constitute the entirety of our analysis.\n\n\n\n\n        28\n         The majority attempts to distinguish Farrakhan on the\nground that the Washington provision at issue in that case was \"not\nas narrow as this one.\" I, however, see no meaningful difference\nbetween disenfranchising felons until the completion of their\nsentences as under the Washington statute, or only while\nincarcerated, as in the case before us.        In any event, the\nnarrowness or breadth of a particular felon disenfranchisement\nscheme bears no relevance upon the question of whether challenges\nto these types of laws are cognizable under the VRA.\n\n                                         -52-\n\f449 F.3d at 367-68; see also Johnson, 405 F.3d at 1247 (Barkett, J.,\n\ndissenting)     (\"[Plaintiffs']    contention    that   Florida's    felon\n\ndisenfranchisement law effectively denies their           right to vote\n\nbecause they are black is clearly encompassed by the plain language\n\nof the VRA.\").\n\n            The majority cannot dispute \"the traditional rule that\n\nwhere the plain text of the statute is unmistakably clear on its\n\nface, there is no need to discuss legislative history.\"          Succar v.\n\nAshcroft, 394 F.3d 8, 31 (1st Cir. 2005) (Lynch, J.)

In fact,\n\ncontrary   to   the   majority’s   contention,   even   with   complicated\n\nstatutory schemes like the VRA, courts have not hesitated to rely\n\non the plain language of the text, where the text plainly answers\n\nthe very question before them.

However, any ambiguity\nin § 2(b) is irrelevant to whether a felon disenfranchisement\nprovision is a voting qualification governed by the Act - a\nquestion which the plain language of § 2(a) unambiguously answers\nin the affirmative. See Robinson, 519 U.S. at 340 (identifying the\nrelevant question as \"whether the language at issue has a plain and\nunambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the\ncase.\" (emphasis added)).\n\n                                       -55-\n\findicates congressional intent to exclude felon disenfranchisement\n\nlaws from § 2's purview so as to justify departing from the plain\n\nlanguage of that provision.

While the\n\nlegislative history of § 2 of the VRA is silent on the particular\n\nquestion of felon disenfranchisement, that history does clearly\n\nindicate that Congress intentionally kept § 2(a) as broad as\n\npossible because it found it \"impossible to predict the variety of\n\nmeans that would be used to infringe on the right to vote\" and\n\nwanted to encompass all such measures that states could devise.\n\nJohnson, 405 F.3d at 1243 (Wilson, J., concurring in part and\n\ndissenting in part); see also Katzenbach, 383 U.S. at 335 (noting\n\nthat \"Congress knew that some of the States . . . had resorted to\n\nthe extraordinary stratagem of contriving new rules of various kinds\n\nfor the sole purpose of perpetuating voting discrimination in the\n\nface of adverse federal court decrees\" and that \"Congress had reason\n\nto suppose that these States might try similar maneuvers in the\n\nfuture\");   H.R.   Rep.    89-439,   at   10   (1965),    reprinted      in   1965\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N.   2437    (1965)   (describing       how,   \"even   after    defeat\n\nresisters s[ought] new ways and means of discriminating,\" and, as\n\n\n\n                                     -57-\n\fa result, rejected the case by case approach that \"too often ha[d]\n\ncaused no change in result, only in methods.\").      Thus, Congress\n\nintentionally chose the expansive language \"voting qualifications\n\nor prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure\" for\n\n§ 2 so as to be \"all-inclusive of any kind of practice\" that might\n\nbe used by states to deny citizens that right.   Allen v. State Bd.\n\nof Elections, 393 U.S. 544, 566-67 (1969) (citing testimony from\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Hearings on the VRA).31   As the Supreme\n\nCourt has held, Congress intended the term \"voting qualification\"\n\nin § 2 to have the \"broadest possible scope\" and to reach \"any state\n\nenactment which altered the election of a covered State in even a\n\nminor way.\"   Id., 393 U.S. at 566-67.32\n\n     31\n        Indicative of Congress's intent to give this prophylactic\nstatute the broadest possible scope, it is notable that an earlier\ndraft of § 2(a) used the slightly narrower language \"qualification\nor procedure,\" but during Senate Hearings on the bill, one Senator\nexpressed concern that the word 'procedure' was not broad enough to\ncover all the various practices that might effectively be employed\nto deny citizens their right to vote.      See Allen, 393 U.S. at\n566-67 & n.8 (citing legislative history). In response, the\nAttorney General said he had no objection to expanding the language\nof the section, to be all-inclusive. Id. Congress then expanded\nthe language in the final version of § 2 to include any \"'voting\nqualifications or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or\nprocedure.'\" Id. (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 1973 (1964)).\n     32\n         In fact, in his concurrence in Holder v. Hall, Justice\nThomas acknowledged that § 2 of the VRA was broadly phrased \"with\nan eye to eliminating the possibility of evasion.\" 512 U.S. 874,\n917 (1994) (Thomas, J., Concurring).     Although Justice Thomas\nargued for a more restrictive interpretation of the scope of § 2\nthan the majority of the Supreme Court had recognized, his more\nrestrictive interpretation of the provision was as follows:\n\n           [T]he specific items described in § 2(a) . . .\n           indicate that Congress was concerned in this\n\n                                -58-\n\f             \"Criminal disenfranchisement is an outright barrier to\n\nvoting that, like the poll tax and literacy test, was adopted in\n\nsome states with racially discriminatory intent and has operated\n\nthroughout    our   nation   with   racially   discriminatory   results.\"\n\nShapiro, supra, at 543.33     Thus, these laws were precisely the type\n\nof potentially discriminatory qualification that Congress intended\n\nto subject to scrutiny under the VRA. Yet the majority definitively\n\nconcludes that the VRA of 1965 was not meant to allow such an action\n\nagainst any felon disenfranchisement law.\n\n\n\n\n             section with any procedure, however it might\n             be denominated, that regulates citizens'\n             access to the ballot – that is, any procedure\n             that might erect a barrier to prevent the\n             potential voter from casting his vote.\n\nId. (emphasis added). Surely, felon disenfranchisement laws, which\noutright bar a segment of the population from voting, fall into\nthis expansive category.\n     33\n        See also George Brooks, Comment, Felon Disenfranchisement:\nLaw, History, Policy and Politics, 32 Fordham Urb. L.J. 851, 858\n(2005) (noting that \"[f]elon disenfranchisement was sometimes used\nas a tool by the states to disenfranchise blacks\" and citing\nexamples of states passing laws \"disenfranchising those convicted\nof what were considered to be 'black' crimes, while those convicted\nof 'white' crimes did not lose their right to vote\"); Virginia E.\nHench, The Death of Voting Rights: The Legal Disenfranchisement of\nMinority Voters, 48 Case W. Res. L. Rev. 727, 738 (1998)\n(describing how, during Reconstruction, in an effort to prevent\nAfrican-Americans from voting, several states enacted felon\ndisenfranchisement laws and \"carefully selected disenfranchising\ncrimes in order to disqualify a disproportionate number of black\nvoters\" and noting that \"many of today's laws disenfranchising\nfelons can trace their roots to attempts by Reconstruction\nconstitutional conventions to enact laws that would keep black\nvoters out of the electoral process\").\n\n                                    -59-\n\f             The    majority    makes     much    of   the    fact    that     felon\n\ndisenfranchisement was not specifically mentioned in the legislative\n\nhistory, but \"it would be a strange canon of statutory construction\n\nthat would require Congress to state in committee reports or\n\nelsewhere in its deliberations that which is obvious on the face of\n\na statute.\"    Harrison v. PPG Industries, Inc., 446 U.S. 578, 592\n\n(1980).   It is also illogical to interpret silence as intent to\n\nexclude, given that the very purpose of § 2's broad language was to\n\navoid reciting the various maneuvers that states may devise in the\n\ncourse of their \"unremitting and ingenious defiance.\"                 Katzenbach,\n\n383 U.S. at 309. Rather, the VRA subjects all voting qualifications\n\nto scrutiny.       In any event, if I were to read anything into that\n\nsilence, I would reach the opposite conclusion.                 This is because\n\nfelon disenfranchisement laws, which were undoubtedly among the\n\nmechanisms     being      employed   by     states     throughout     the      post-\n\nreconstruction      era   to   deprive    minorities     of   the    vote,34   were\n\ninevitably within Congress's contemplation when drafting the VRA.\n\nHad Congress had intended to exclude this particular type of\n\nqualification from the reach of the statute, it could have done so\n\nexplicitly.        But    Congress   made    no   provisos     to    carve     felon\n\ndisenfranchisement laws out from the purposely \"all inclusive\"\n\nlanguage of § 2(a).       See Allen, 393 U.S. at 566.         In this historical\n\n\n\n     34\n        See, e.g., Shapiro, supra, at 543; Brooks, supra, at 858;\nHench, supra, at 738.\n\n                                      -60-\n\fcontext, congressional silence suggests, if anything, that no such\n\nexclusion was intended.\n\n           Moreover,       through   the    1982   amendments   to   the   VRA,\n\nCongress expanded the remedial power of the Act even further by\n\nrelieving plaintiffs of the burden of proving discriminatory intent.\n\nOverturning a Supreme Court case that held that the original Act\n\ncontained such a requirement, see Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U.S. 55, 61\n\n(1980), Congress, through the 1982 amendments, made clear that a\n\nviolation of § 2 could be established by proof of discriminatory\n\nresults. See Thornburg, 478 U.S. at 43-44 (emphasis added) (reading\n\nthe 1982 Amendment to the VRA as effectively overturning the Bolden\n\nrequirement of showing purposeful discrimination); S. Rep. No.\n\n97-417, at 27-28, 36-37 (1982), as reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N.\n\n177, 204-06, 214-15 (noting that the purpose of the Amendments was\n\nto repeal Bolden and to focus the judicial inquiry only into whether\n\nthere exists equal access to electoral opportunity).            Congress did\n\nso because it recognized the difficulty of proving deliberate and\n\npurposeful discrimination, and sought to ensure that \"in the context\n\nof all the circumstances in the jurisdiction in question,\" any\n\ndisparate racial impact of facially neutral voting requirements did\n\nnot result from racial discrimination.             S. Rep. No. 97-417 at 27.\n\nThis \"results test\" was intended \"to serve as a prophylactic against\n\nvoting practices -- such as felon disenfranchisement . . . adopted\n\nor   retained   due   to   intentional      discrimination   that    would   be\n\n\n\n                                     -61-\n\fdifficult to prove in court.\"              Daniel P. Tokaji, The New Vote\n\nDenial: Where Election Reform Meets the Voting Rights Act, 57 S.C.\n\nL. Rev. 689, 722 (2006).       And its Report accompanying the enactment\n\nof the 1982 amendments, the Senate endorsed statements made by the\n\nAttorney General during the original VRA hearings that the purpose\n\nof \"Section 2 w[as] [to] ban 'any kind of practice . . . if its\n\npurpose or effect was to deny or abridge the right to vote on\n\naccount of race or color.\"           S. Rep. No. 97-417, at 17 (emphasis\n\nadded).    Given this history, it would be wholly incongruous with\n\nCongress's broad ameliorative intent to conclude, as does the\n\nmajority, that where the particular voter qualification that results\n\nin racial discrimination happens to be a felon disenfranchisement\n\nlaw, in this eventuality only, does the VRA provide no relief and\n\npermit the discriminatory qualification to persist.\n\n            To reach this unlikely result, the majority relies on\n\nassorted evidence of the widespread use and general sanction of\n\nfelon disenfranchisement laws in various contexts. But all that any\n\nof this evidence actually shows is that felon disenfranchisement is\n\nnot   presumptively      invalid,    a    proposition   as   to    which,    after\n\nRichardson, 418 U.S. at 56, there is no doubt.                     None of the\n\nmajority's arguments support its conclusion that Congress intended\n\nto insulate such laws from scrutiny under § 2 of the VRA where they\n\nare alleged to effect a discriminatory result.               Specifically, the\n\nevidence   relied   on    by   the   majority   includes     (1)   §   2    of   the\n\n\n\n                                         -62-\n\fFourteenth Amendment, (2) the legislative history of VRA § 4, and\n\n(3) Congressional endorsement of felon disenfranchisement generally.\n\nI will address each of these sources in turn.\n\n           A.    Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment\n\n           The   majority   suggests     that   felon   disenfranchisement\n\nsomehow differs from other voting qualifications because the \"power\n\nof the states to disqualify from voting those convicted of crimes\n\nis explicitly set forth in § 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\"         But,\n\nlooking at the text of that provision in context, it is by no means\n\na grant of power to states to disenfranchise felons.             See U.S.\n\nConst. amend. XIV, § 2.     Rather, that provision simply states that\n\ndisenfranchised felons, unlike other persons disenfranchised by the\n\nStates, are to be included within the census for purposes of\n\napportioning representatives.35\n\n\n\n\n     35\n          In relevant part, that provision states as follows:\n\n           Representatives shall be apportioned among the\n           several States according to their respective\n           numbers, . . . . But when the right to vote\n           . . . is denied to any of the male inhabitants\n           of such State, being twenty-one years of age,\n           and citizens of the United States, or in any\n           way abridged, except for participation in\n           rebellion, or other crime, the basis of\n           representation therein shall be reduced in the\n           proportion which the number of such male\n           citizens shall bear to the whole number of\n           male citizens twenty-one years of age in such\n           State.\n\nU.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 2.\n\n                                  -63-\n\f           The most that can be gleaned from this language is that\n\nby   addressing   the   eventuality   of   \"abridg[ment]   .   .   .   for\n\nparticipation in . . . crime,\" Congress contemplated that at least\n\nin some circumstances, felon disenfranchisement could exist. Thus,\n\nit merely implies that there is no per se ban on such laws.        But VRA\n\n§ 2 is targeted at precisely those voting qualifications that are\n\nnot the subject of a per se ban.        See S. Rep. No. 97-417, at 16\n\n(explaining that under § 2 as amended in 1982, \"electoral devices\n\n. . . per se would not be subject to attack under section 2.           They\n\nwould only be vulnerable, if, in the totality of circumstances, they\n\nresulted in the denial of equal access to the electoral process\").\n\nAs plaintiffs do not allege that felon disenfranchisement laws are\n\nunlawful per se, but only as applied in Massachusetts, where they\n\n\"result in a denial . . . of the right . . . to vote on account of\n\nrace,\" 42 U.S.C. § 1973, there is absolutely no conflict between §\n\n2 of the Fourteenth Amendment and allowing plaintiffs to challenge\n\ndisenfranchisement laws under the VRA.\n\n           In other words, that § 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment\n\ncontemplates disenfranchisement as a potential qualification is\n\nunremarkable.     As similarly emphasized by the majority, \"[t]he\n\ncriteria for eligibility to vote are defined by the states,\" and\n\nstates have the power to fix all kinds of qualifications for voting,\n\ndisqualifying felons included, but only where the exercise of that\n\npower \"do[es] not contravene any restriction that Congress, acting\n\n\n\n                                 -64-\n\fpursuant to its constitutional powers, has imposed.\"    Lassiter v.\n\nNorthampton County Bd. Of Elections, 360 U.S. 45, 50 (1959).36\n\nHowever, \"[w]hile a State may choose to disenfranchise some, all or\n\nnone of its felons based on legitimate concerns, it may not do so\n\nbased upon distinctions that have the effect, whether intentional\n\nor not, of disenfranchising felons because of their race.\"   Hayden,\n\n449 F.3d at 346 (Parker, J., dissenting) (quoting Baker, 85 F.3d at\n\n937); see also Farrakhan, 338 F.3d at 1016 (noting that although,\n\nas a general matter, \"states may deprive felons of the right to vote\n\nwithout violating the Fourteenth Amendment, . . . when felon\n\ndisenfranchisement results in denial of the right to vote . . . on\n\naccount of race or color, Section 2 affords disenfranchised felons\n\nthe means to seek redress\").\n\n           B.   Legislative History of VRA § 4\n\n           To support its contention that Congress did not intend to\n\ninclude felon disenfranchisement laws within the scope of VRA § 2,\n\nthe majority also relies on statements in the legislative history\n\n\n     36\n         In fact, the majority’s contrary interpretation of § 2 of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment, i.e. that felon disenfranchisement is\nconstitutionally protected and cannot be restricted, would result\nin a direct conflict between constitutional directives in that it\nis well-established that a felon disenfranchisement statute\nintended to discriminate against minorities are prohibited under\n§ 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment. See Hunter v. Underwood, 471 U.S.\n222, 229 (1985) (holding Alabama's disenfranchisement for\ncommission    of    petty   crime    or    misdemeanor    provision\nunconstitutional).    The only reading of § 2 that respects the\nvalidity of Hunter and similar precedent is one that permits states\nto disenfranchise felons only where federal law does not otherwise\npreclude them from doing so.\n\n                                -65-\n\fof § 4, claiming that § 4 \"would not result in the proscription of\n\nthe frequent requirement of States . . . that an applicant for\n\nvoting . . . be free of conviction of a felony.\"             S. Rep. No. 89-162\n\n(1965), as reprinted in 1965 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2508, 2562. This argument\n\nis deeply flawed.     It is error to assume that a statement about one\n\nsection of a statute applies to all other sections thereof.                  See\n\nHayden, 449 F.3d at 352-53 (Parker, J., dissenting) (stating that\n\nlegislative history of one section of an expansive statute such as\n\nVRA is \"typically of no value\" when attempting to understand\n\nanother, entirely different, section).            In fact, the Supreme Court\n\nhas explicitly warned against doing so in the VRA context.                 Hall,\n\n512 U.S. at 883 (\"To be sure, if the structure and purpose of § 2\n\nmirrored that of § 5, then the case for interpreting §§ 2 and 5 to\n\nhave the same application in all cases would be convincing. But the\n\ntwo sections differ in structure, purpose, and application.\"). This\n\nis especially true in the case before us given that the two\n\nprovisions, § 2 and § 4, \"differ             in structure, purpose, and\n\napplication.\"   Id.      Specifically,       §    4   is   a   provision    that\n\ncategorically bans, in covered jurisdictions, the use of certain\n\nfacially   neutral    tests   or   devices       including     literacy    tests,\n\neducational requirements, and \"any requirement that a person as a\n\nprerequisite for voting or registration for voting . . . possess\n\ngood moral character.\"    See 42 U.S.C. § 1973b(a)(1)(A), § 1973b(c).\n\nIn contrast, § 2 applies to \"a broader range of practices than those\n\n\n\n                                   -66-\n\f'tests and devices' defined in Section 4.\"              Johnson, 353 F.3d at\n\n1306 n.27.    While § 4 applies only to \"covered jurisdictions,\" and\n\n\"imposes an outright ban on tests or devices,\" \"§ 2(a), [applies\n\nnationally,     and]   creates   a     'results'   test,     which    requires\n\ninvestigating and weighing numerous factors.\"            Hayden, 449 F.3d at\n\n353 (Parker, J., dissenting) (internal citation omitted); see also\n\nNw. Austin, 557 U.S. at __, 2009 WL 1738645 at *4 (distinguishing\n\n§ 2 of the VRA, which \"operates nationwide . . . [to] forbid[] any\n\n'standard practice or procedure' that 'results in a denial or the\n\nabridgment of the right of any citizen . . . to vote on account of\n\nrace or color'\" from § 4 and the remainder of the VRA which,\n\n\"[r]ather than continuing to depend on case-by-case litigation . . .\n\ndirectly     pre-empted    the       most    powerful     tools      of   black\n\ndisenfranchisement in the covered areas.\" (emphasis added & internal\n\ncitations omitted)).\n\n             Thus, considering congressional statements about § 4 in\n\nthe context of the provision at which they were addressed (§ 4),\n\nthey signify nothing about the scope of what § 2 was intended to\n\ncover.     Given § 4's absolute bar on \"good moral character\" tests,\n\nand the natural susceptibility of \"moral character\" being read as\n\na proxy for criminal history, the statements upon which the majority\n\nrelies merely clarify that the categorical bar on \"good moral\n\ncharacter\" tests in § 4 should not be interpreted as also an\n\noutright ban on felon disenfranchisement.          See Hayden, 449 F.3d at\n\n\n\n                                      -67-\n\f364-65 (Calabresi, J., dissenting) (\"[S]uch legislative statements\n\nsimply make the uncontroversial point that felon disenfranchisement\n\nlaws are not 'good moral character' requirements within the meaning\n\nof § 4(c).\").

Varnum,\n\nLet's Not Jump to Conclusions: Approaching Felon Disenfranchisement\n\nChallenges Under the Voting Rights Act, 14 Mich. J. Race & L. 109,\n\n136 (2008).     Statements regarding § 4 thus provide no indication\n\nthat Congress intended to insulate felon disenfranchisement laws\n\nfrom scrutiny under § 2 where it is alleged that the operation of\n\na particular law results in the denial of the right to vote on\n\naccount of race.         See Johnson, 405 F.3d at 1249 (Barkett, J.,\n\ndissenting)      (noting      that    decision        not   to   add    felon\n\ndisenfranchisement statutes to list of per se violations does not\n\nshow intent to exempt these laws from the VRA); Hayden, 449 F.3d at\n\n365 (Calabresi, J., dissenting) (\"The fact that race-neutral felon\n\ndisenfranchisement is permissible under § 4(c) tells us nothing at\n\nall   about    whether    §   2   allows   racially    discriminatory   felon\n\ndisenfranchisement.\" (emphasis in original)).\n\n              In support of its argument for applying § 4's legislative\n\nhistory to § 2, the majority suggests that, in light of § 4's\n\nlimited applicability to \"covered jurisdictions\" with a history of\n\ndiscrimination, in contrast to § 2's nationwide reach, Congress\n\n\n\n                                      -68-\n\fcould not have \"permitted\" felon disenfranchisement laws in covered\n\njurisdictions, while \"prohibiting\" them in non-covered jurisdictions\n\nlike Massachusetts.      But this argument similarly misses the mark,\n\nprecisely because it mischaracterizes the statute.                  To be sure, the\n\nmajority’s    argument   would   be     persuasive     if   §   2    categorically\n\n\"prohibit[ted]\" felon disenfranchisement laws in Massachusetts and\n\nother \"non-covered\" jurisdictions.            But it does not.           See S. Rep.\n\nNo.   97-417,    at   16.        Nor    does     the    VRA     \"permit\"       felon\n\ndisenfranchisement laws, in \"covered jurisdictions,\" or otherwise.\n\nRather, § 2 uniformly imposes a \"totality of the circumstances\" test\n\nto all \"voting qualifications,\" anywhere in the country, prohibiting\n\nthem only in the event that they result in racial discrimination.\n\nThere is nothing illogical about creating a per se ban on certain\n\npresumptively      discriminatory         qualifications            in      \"covered\n\njurisdictions\" only, as was done in § 4, but also permitting\n\nscrutiny   of all voting qualifications nationally, including felon\n\ndisenfranchisement laws, to ensure that no particular qualification\n\nis discriminatory as applied under the particular circumstances.\n\nAnd that is precisely what Congress did through § 2.\n\n             By exporting the legislative history of § 4 into the § 2\n\ncontext, the majority ignores the very plausible interpretation that\n\nCongress intended § 2 to include felony disenfranchisement laws\n\nprecisely because it chose to exclude them from § 4's list of\n\ncategorically barred regulations.             While Congress did not seek to\n\n\n\n                                       -69-\n\fhave felon disenfranchisement banned in all cases, it nevertheless\n\nintended that they be subjected, just like every other voting\n\nqualification anywhere in the country, to a \"totality of the\n\ncircumstances\"      test   to     assess     whether   they     effectuate     a\n\ndiscriminatory result.          The fact that members of Congress were\n\nsufficiently cognizant of felon disenfranchisement laws to carve\n\nthem out from the scope of § 4, yet made no such statements in\n\nregard to § 2, despite the intentionally broad language of that\n\nprovision, indicates that Congress did not in fact intend a similar\n\nrestriction in the § 2 context.            See Vidal-Reyes, 562 F.3d at 53\n\n(quoting United States v. Councilman, 418 F.3d 67, 73 (1st Cir.\n\n2005)) (\"'[W]here Congress includes particular language in one\n\nsection of a statute but omits it in another section of the same\n\nAct, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and\n\npurposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.'\").37                Thus, as\n\nit stands, the legislative history of § 4 shows that while Congress\n\ndid not intend to enact a blanket ban on felon disenfranchisement\n\nlaws as a prohibited \"moral character\" requirement neither did it\n\nintend    to   exclude   discriminatory     laws   from   the   scope    of   VRA\n\nscrutiny.\n\n\n\n     37\n        While this rule, known as the expressio unius est exclusio\nalterius canon of construction, see Councilman, 418 F.3d at 73-74,\nis useful for evaluating the import of omissions and inclusions in\nstatutory text, I believe its principle is equally persuasive with\nrespect to express omissions and inclusions in the legislative\nhistory of a statute.\n\n                                     -70-\n\f            C.    Historical Legitimacy and Congressional Endorsement\n                  of Felon Disenfranchisement Law\n\n            The remainder of the arguments in the majority opinion\n\nrely on Congress' sanctioning or presupposing the validity of felon\n\ndisenfranchisement in various contexts, such as where (1) it has\n\nrejected proposals to outright bar felon disenfranchisement, either\n\nthrough the VRA or otherwise, and (2) endorsed disenfranchisement\n\nlaws    generally    in   the    aftermath     of    the    VRA.   First    of    all,\n\n\"subsequent legislative history will rarely override a reasonable\n\ninterpretation of a statute that can be gleaned from its language\n\nand legislative history prior to its enactment.\" Solid Waste Agency\n\nof N. Cook County v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng'rs, 531 U.S. 159, 170\n\nn.5 (2001) (quoting Consumer Prod. Safety Comm'n v. GTE Sylvania,\n\nInc., 447 U.S. 102, 118 n.13 (1980)).               But more importantly, these\n\narguments   are     entirely     irrelevant     to    the    question    before    us.\n\nCongressional refusal to pass categorical prohibitions on felon\n\ndisenfranchisement        or    even   its   subsequent       affirmation    of    the\n\npractice generally, is not inconsistent with Congress's clear intent\n\nto subject to scrutiny, through § 2 of the VRA, \"any state enactment\n\nwhich altered the election law of a covered State in even a minor\n\nway.\"    Allen, 393 U.S. at 566-67 (emphasis added).                    Congress may\n\nvery well have decided not to bar felon disenfranchisement wholesale\n\n(as it did by omitting it from § 4) and may even have endorsed the\n\npractice where it was motivated by and served legitimate ends.                     But\n\nit may have nevertheless chosen, in order to make the guarantees of\n\n                                        -71-\n\fthe Fifteenth Amendment meaningful, to restrict the adoption of this\n\n\"qualification\" in those cases where it is applied \"in a manner\n\nwhich results\" in the denial of the right to vote on account of\n\nrace.   This reading of the legislative history, which is consistent\n\nwith the statutory text, is far more compelling than the majority's\n\nanalysis.\n\n            Ultimately,   \"the   plainer   the   language,   the   more\n\nconvincing contrary legislative history must be to overcome the\n\nnatural purport of a statute's language.\"        United States v. U.S.\n\nSteel Corp., 482 F.2d 439, 444 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S.\n\n909 (1973).   I see a clear textual mandate, uncontradicted by any\n\nlegislative history, that felon disenfranchisement laws, like all\n\nvoting qualifications, may be challenged under § 2 of the VRA.      \"If\n\nthe language of law is to have any meaning at all, then surely it\n\nmust prevail over the kind of speculation that is entailed in such\n\nan enterprise as th[is] court[] ha[s] undertaken.\"       United States\n\nex rel. Siller v. Becton Dickinson & Co., 21 F.3d 1339, 1355 (4th\n\nCir. 1994).\n\n            The plain language of the statute being as clear as it\n\nis, and the legislative history and purpose only bolstering that\n\nclarity, I cannot help but speculate that the majority is jumping\n\nthrough hoops to defeat the remedial purpose for which the provision\n\nwas enacted in order to produce a result consistent with its own\n\npreference in policy.     But \"[t]he Fifteenth Amendment empowers\n\n\n\n                                 -72-\n\f'Congress,' not the [c]ourt[s], to determine in the first instance\n\nwhat legislation is needed to enforce it.\"             Nw. Austin, 557 U.S. at\n\n___, 2009 WL 1738645 at *9.          And even if we \"question the wisdom of\n\nCongress's decision to enact a statute that permits challenging\n\nfelon disenfranchisement laws, we are judges, not policy-makers.\"\n\nHayden, 449 F.3d at 348 (Parker, J., dissenting).               \"The duty of a\n\njudge is to follow the law, not to question its plain terms.\" Id.,\n\n449 F.3d at 368 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). \"I do not believe that\n\nCongress wishes us to disregard the plain language of any statute\n\nor to invent exceptions to the statutes it has created.\"                 Id.\n\n              Finally,   I    see    no    constitutional     issues    posed     by\n\ninterpreting the VRA according to its language and consistent with\n\nits purpose, so as to encompass felon disenfranchisement laws.\n\nRather, § 2 of the VRA is firmly within the scope of Congress’s\n\npower to enforce the Reconstruction amendments, which includes the\n\npower to \"enact so-called prophylactic legislation that proscribes\n\nfacially constitutional conduct, in order to prevent and deter\n\nunconstitutional conduct.\"           Nev. Dep't of Human Res. v. Hibbs, 538\n\nU.S.   721,     727-28       (2003).         Finding   challenges       to     felon\n\ndisenfranchisement laws to be cognizable under the VRA, I have no\n\ntrouble   concluding     that       the   plaintiffs   have    stated    a     claim\n\nsufficient to preclude dismissal at this early juncture.                     Thus, I\n\nwould affirm the district court's decision on this issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -73-\n\f                       II.    Ex Post Facto Clause Claim\n\n            The second issue raised on appeal, a question of first\n\nimpression in this circuit, is whether the retroactive application\n\nof a felon disenfranchisement provision violates the Ex Post Facto\n\nClause    when    it   is    applied   to   felons     incarcerated       for    crimes\n\ncommitted prior to the provision's passage into law.                     The Ex Post\n\nFacto    Clause    \"bars     application     of    a   law     'that    changes    the\n\npunishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed\n\nto the crime, when committed[.]'\"              Johnson v. United States, 529\n\nU.S. 694, 699 (2000) (quoting Calder v. Bull, 3 U.S. 386, 390\n\n(1798)); see U.S. Const. art. 1, § 10 (\"No State shall . . . pass\n\nany . . . ex post facto Law.\").                   Plaintiffs, incarcerated in\n\nMassachusetts      for      offenses   committed       prior    to     Article    120's\n\nenactment, contend that Article 120 is unconstitutional as applied\n\nto them because it subjects them to additional punishment not\n\nprovided for by the laws of the Commonwealth when they committed the\n\nacts    underlying     their    convictions.         The   majority      affirms    the\n\ndismissal of plaintiffs' claim on grounds that the deprivation of\n\nthe    right to vote, as accomplished by Article 120, does                         not\n\nconstitute \"punishment,\" and thus, falls outside the protections of\n\nthe Ex Post Facto Clause.         I cannot agree.          While disenfranchising\n\nconvicted felons prospectively might be perfectly constitutional,\n\nI would hold that the disenfranchisement provision here is a\n\npunitive measure, which cannot be retroactively applied.\n\n\n                                        -74-\n\f            \"The deprivation of any rights, civil or political,\n\npreviously enjoyed, may be punishment, the circumstances attending\n\nand the causes of the deprivation determining this fact.\"           Cummings\n\nv. Missouri, 71 U.S. 277, 320 (1866).         As the majority accurately\n\nexplains,   analysis   of   whether    a   particular   enactment   imposes\n\nretroactive punishment so as to implicate the Ex Post Facto Clause\n\nrequires a two-part inquiry.          The first part asks whether the\n\nchallenged law has a civil, regulatory purpose, or whether it is\n\nintended to punish.     See Smith v. Doe, 538 U.S. 84, 92 (2002)\n\n(citing Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346, 361 (1997)).         If a court\n\nfinds that the law was intended to be punitive, then it constitutes\n\n\"punishment\" for purposes of the Ex Post Facto Clause and would\n\nviolate the clause if retroactively applied.        Id.   However, if the\n\nlaw conveys a non-punitive, regulatory purpose, the court moves to\n\nthe second part of the test to ascertain whether the law is \"so\n\npunitive either in purpose or effect as to negate [the state's]\n\nintention to deem it civil.\"     Id. (quoting United States v. Ward,\n\n448 U.S. 242, 248-49 (1980)).         The ultimate question is \"whether\n\n[Article 120] is intended to be, or by its nature necessarily is,\n\ncriminal and punitive, or civil and remedial.\" United States v. One\n\nAssortment of 89 Firearms, 465 U.S. 354, 362 (1984).\n\n            While legislative purpose is not easily discernible given\n\nthe unique procedural history of Article 120's enactment by popular\n\nreferendum, I nevertheless find that a close look at the provision's\n\n\n\n                                  -75-\n\flanguage and history reveals that it was intended by its proponents\n\nto be a primarily punitive measure.        Moreover, even if the primary\n\nintent behind the enactment of Article 120 could not be clearly\n\nidentified,38 I would find this disenfranchisement law to be so\n\npunitive in effect that it nevertheless constitutes a criminal\n\npunishment under the second prong of Smith.\n\n             A.    The Legislative Intent Was Punitive\n\n             We first ask whether Article 120 was intended to be a\n\ncivil or criminal measure.       See Smith, 538 U.S. at 92.    Determining\n\nwhether Article 120 was intended to be civil or criminal \"'is first\n\nof all a question of statutory construction.'\"                Id. (quoting\n\nHendricks, 521 U.S. at 361). As this court has made clear, analysis\n\nof   statutory    construction   \"begin[s]   with   the   language   of   the\n\nstatute.\" Phillips v. Pembroke Real Estate, Inc., 459 F.3d 128, 139\n\n(1st Cir. 2006) (quoting Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U.S. 438,\n\n450 (2002)).      Yet, in holding that Article 120 conveys a regulatory\n\nintent,    the    majority again departs from this well-established\n\nframework.\n\n             The majority disposes of the first prong of Smith by\n\nciting     Trop    v.   Dulles   for   the   proposition      that   \"felon\n\n\n\n      38\n        See Gabriel J. Chin, Are Collateral Sanctions Premised on\nConduct or Conviction?, 30 Fordham Urb. L.J. 1685, 1686 (2003)\n(opining that \"it is not always clear that the primary legislative\nmotivation for a collateral sanction is civil rather than punitive,\nnor is it always a simple matter to discern the primary\nmotivation\").\n\n                                    -76-\n\fdisenfranchisement provisions are considered regulatory rather then\n\npunitive.\"           See 356 U.S. 86, 94 (1958).         But leaving aside the\n\nmerits     of    this     proposition   for     the    moment,   the    fact    that\n\ndisenfranchisement provisions are generally considered regulatory\n\nrather than punitive is not dispositive of what the Massachusetts\n\nvoters     and       legislators   intended    here.     Rather,    the      relevant\n\nquestions are what Article 120's particular language says and if\n\nthere are any inferences that can be drawn from                        its   broader\n\nstructure.       See Smith, 538 U.S. at 92 (instructing that we should\n\nfirst \"consider the statute's text and its structure to determine\n\nthe legislative objective\").             \"[C]onsiderable deference must be\n\naccorded to the intent as the legislature has stated it.\"                     Id.\n\n                In this case, looking at the text of Article 120, there\n\nis no indication on the face of the provision of the legislative\n\nintent behind its enactment. Article 120, which was passed pursuant\n\nto a ballot question placed before Commonwealth voters, lacks any\n\nkind of express \"statement of purpose\" which legislation often\n\nincludes, and none of its language reveals a particular government\n\ninterest        in    felon   disenfranchisement,       either     regulatory       or\n\npunitive.39          Instead, Article 120 merely lays out the substantive\n\n\n\n\n      39\n        For an example of the kind of clear language \"express[ing]\nthe objective of [a] law in the statutory text itself,\" see Smith,\n538 U.S. at 93 (citing the Alaska Legislature's public safety\ninterest in \"protecting the public from sex offenders\" as the basis\nfor its sex offender registration provision).\n\n                                        -77-\n\fvoting requirements, including the newly enacted                     exclusion of\n\nincarcerated felons.\n\n               Beyond the language of the provision, it is possible that\n\nthe \"broader structure\" of the provision may provide some indication\n\nof its purpose.          Id.     The majority relies on the placement of\n\nArticle 120 within the Commonwealth's civil voter qualification\n\nprovisions, rather than in its criminal code, to infer a regulatory\n\npurpose.       But while manner of codification is certainly one factor\n\nrelevant to ascertaining the nature of a provision, the Supreme\n\nCourt    has    held that the \"location and labels of a statutory\n\nprovision do not by themselves transform a civil remedy into a\n\ncriminal one,\" or vice versa. Smith, 538 U.S. at 94; see also Trop,\n\n356 U.S. at 94 (\"How simple would be the tasks of constitutional\n\nadjudication and of law generally if specific problems could be\n\nsolved by inspection of the labels pasted on them! Manifestly the\n\nissue    of    whether   [a    statute]   is   a   penal   law    cannot    be   thus\n\ndetermined.\").      Rather, the Supreme Court instructs that \"a penalty\n\n[] cannot be converted into [a non-penal measure] by so naming it,\"\n\nand we must \"ascribe to [the particular statute] the character\n\ndisclosed by its purpose and operation, regardless of name.\" United\n\nStates v. Constantine, 296 U.S. 287, 294 (1935) (holding that even\n\nthough    labeled    a   \"tax\"    on   conducting    retail      liquor    business,\n\nchallenged statute was nevertheless a \"penalty\" designed to punish\n\nthe violation of state liquor laws).                 Likewise, \"even a clear\n\n\n\n                                        -78-\n\flegislative classification of a statute as 'non-penal' would not\n\nalter the fundamental nature of a plainly penal statute.\" Trop, 356\n\nU.S. at 95 (holding that a statute stripping army deserters of\n\ncitizenship is a \"penal law\" despite its codification amidst the\n\nregulatory provisions of the \"Nationality Act\"); see also One\n\nAssortment of 89 Firearms, 465 U.S. at 364-65 (holding a forfeiture\n\nprovision to be a civil action despite its codification in the\n\nstate's    criminal   code).     It    follows   that   the   Commonwealth's\n\nauthority to regulate voting requirements as part of its civil power\n\ndoes not, in and of itself, establish that Article 120 was intended\n\nas a regulatory measure.\n\n             Moreover, any inference of legislative intent that could\n\nbe drawn from the codification of Article 120 in a civil section of\n\nMassachusetts' constitution is undermined by the fact that the\n\nCommonwealth was required to amend that constitutional provision,\n\nwhich     governs   voting   qualifications      generally,   in   order   to\n\ndisenfranchise felons.       In addition, the subject matter of Article\n\n120 is consistent not only with civil voting requirements, but also\n\nwith criminal rules imposing an additional deprivation upon persons\n\nconvicted of particular crimes and in the custody of the criminal\n\njustice system.       In that sense, Article 120's broader structure\n\nimplies both criminal punishment and civil regulation.              In sum,\n\nneither the language nor the structure of Article 120 betrays a\n\nclear regulatory or punitive intent.\n\n\n\n                                      -79-\n\f            Without a clear indication of intended purpose from\n\nArticle 120 itself, we look to legislative history for evidence of\n\nlegislative intent.40      Rolland v. Romney, 318 F.3d 42, 48 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).    Here, there are two helpful sources of legislative history\n\n-- public statements made by Massachusetts' politicians about a\n\nseries of disenfranchisement proposals that ultimately resulted in\n\nArticle 120,41 and the \"Information for Voters\" Guide (\"the Guide\")\n\nthat was distributed to voters at the law's ratification stage.\n\n            First,   the    public   statements   of   proponents   of   the\n\nlegislation are quite revealing of the punitive motivation behind\n\nArticle 120.    Writing to the Massachusetts Legislature to propose\n\nan earlier version of the instant disenfranchisement law, Governor\n\nCellucci argued that \"the time has come to tell would-be criminals\n\nin Massachusetts that committing crimes has serious consequences.\"42\n\n     40\n         It is surprising that, given its extensive reliance on\nstatements in the legislative history to analyze the clear\nstatutory language of the VRA, the majority only mentions\nlegislative history briefly in its Ex Post Facto Clause analysis,\neven though the language and structure of Article 120 is actually\nambiguous as to whether Article 120 was intended to be punitive or\nregulatory.   While the majority states that it will consider\ncertain comments made by Governor Cellucci, it never analyzes these\nor other comments by Article 120's proponents relevant to the\nlegislative history of the provision.\n     41\n        The legislative process resulting in the passage of Article\n120 is worth noting. A constitutional amendment initiated by a\nlegislator must be approved by two successive joint sessions of the\nMassachusetts legislature and then ratified by Massachusetts\nvoters. Commonwealth Mass. Const. Art. 49, Init., pt. IV, §§ 2-5.\n     42\n         I agree with the majority that, even though earlier\nproposals for felon disenfranchisement laws did not pass, their\nlegislative histories are relevant here. These earlier proposals\n\n                                     -80-\n\fHe   advocated    for   the    proposal   because      it    would    \"ensure   that\n\ncriminals pay their debt to society before they regain their right\n\nto participate in the political process.\"               Governor Cellucci also\n\nargued in favor of disenfranchising incarcerated felons because\n\n\"prisons are a place for punishment.\"               Striking a similar tone,\n\nState Representative Paul Frost argued that prisoners \"don't deserve\n\nto vote\" and that \"this is an issue about justice.\"                    Senator Guy\n\nGlodis advocated for the law by stating that \"philosophically, no\n\ninmates deserve the right to vote.\"              These comments, reflecting\n\nclassic punitive rationales, see, infra, section II.B.4 (discussing\n\ntraditional      theories     of   criminal    punishment),      provide       strong\n\nevidence that Article 120 was motivated by an intent to punish\n\nfelons.\n\n           As     the   majority     recognizes,       the    Guide    for    voters\n\nregarding the ballot question that culminated in the enactment of\n\nArticle 120, is also relevant to deciphering legislative intent.\n\nThe Guide stated that the proposal would change the law that \"allows\n\ncriminals to continue to exercise control over our lives by voting\n\nfrom   prison.\"      The    majority   found    such    language       to    indicate\n\nregulatory intent.          I disagree.       While this language is more\n\nambiguous as to intent than anything else, it suggests to me another\n\n\nare nearly identical to Article 120, so the motivation for them is\nrelevant evidence for the motivation behind Article 120.       See\nKennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. 144, 180 (1963) (using the\nlegislative history of earlier legislation when assessing the\nmotivation of a law \"quite obviously patterned on that of its\npredecessor\").\n\n                                       -81-\n\fretributive statement about what felons \"deserve,\" i.e. to have\n\ntheir right to participate in government revoked.               See id.   The\n\nGuide also stated that \"[a] yes vote will protect democracy's\n\ngreatest gift - the right to vote, by reserving it for the law-\n\nabiding.\"        I believe this language is further evidence of the\n\npunitive principle of \"just desert.\"         In any event, the ambiguous\n\nindications of intent revealed by the Guide do not outweigh the\n\nplainly punitive comments by the measure's proponents.\n\n            Confronted      with   potentially   mixed   manifestations    of\n\nlegislative purpose        -- and I believe such a characterization is\n\ngenerous    to    the   Commonwealth's   position   --   this   court   should\n\ndecipher the law's \"primary function.\"           See Mendoza-Martinez, 372\n\nU.S. at 169 (emphasis added). Whereas Article 120 itself is unclear\n\nas to intent, the Guide is also, at best, ambiguous, and the\n\nstatements made by Massachusetts politicians are strongly indicative\n\nof punitive intent, I find that plaintiffs have made a compelling\n\nargument that the weight of the evidence of intent reveals Article\n\n120 to have been intended primarily as a punitive measure.                This\n\npunitive measure having been applied to plaintiffs retroactively,\n\nI believe that an Ex Post Facto violation could be found without\n\nfurther inquiry.        But in an abundance of caution, I will proceed.\n\n            B.     The Effect of Article 120 Is Punitive\n\n            Under the second prong of the Smith analysis, even if a\n\nclear punitive intent is not discernable for the challenged law, it\n\n\n                                     -82-\n\fwould nevertheless constitute a criminal punishment subject to the\n\nEx Post Facto Clause if the measure's effect is so punitive as to\n\nnegate any intent to deem it civil.      Hendricks, 521 U.S. at 361\n\n(citing Ward, 448 U.S. at 248-49).    The majority correctly explains\n\nthat, in order to gauge the actual effect of the law, this court\n\nreviews the seven factors described in Mendoza-Martinez:\n\n          [(1)] Whether the sanction involves an\n          affirmative disability or restraint, [(2)]\n          whether it has historically been regarded as\n          a punishment, [(3)] whether it comes into play\n          only on a finding of scienter, [(4)] whether\n          its operation will promote the traditional\n          aims of punishment-retribution and deterrence,\n          [(5)] whether the behavior to which it applies\n          is already a crime, [(6)] whether an\n          alternative purpose to which it may rationally\n          be connected is assignable for it, and [(7)]\n          whether it appears excessive in relation to\n          the alternative purpose assigned.\n\nSee Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. at 168-69 (footnotes omitted). These\n\nfactors, which are \"neither exhaustive nor dispositive,\" serve as\n\n\"useful guideposts.\"   Smith, 538 U.S. at 97 (citations omitted).\n\n          I agree with the majority that, where the legislature has\n\nclearly stated a civil regulatory intent in enacting the challenged\n\nsanction, \"'only the clearest proof' will suffice to override\n\nlegislative intent and transform what has been denominated a civil\n\nremedy into a criminal penalty.\"     Hudson v. United States, 52 U.S.\n\n93, 100 (1997) (quoting Ward, 448 U.S. at 249). However, I disagree\n\nthat plaintiffs should be held to that burden, in this case, where\n\nthe legislative intent is ambiguous at best.    The Supreme Court has\n\n\n\n                               -83-\n\fnot resolved this particular question directly.               However, where the\n\nlegislature fails to make its intent clear through express language,\n\nor by implication through a law's broader structure, or even through\n\nlegislative history, there is strong support for the proposition\n\nthat a challenged law should be subjected to neutral evaluation when\n\ndetermining its effect.           See Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. at 169\n\n(holding that, \"[a]bsent conclusive evidence of congressional intent\n\nas   to   the    penal   nature   of   a   statute,   these    factors   must   be\n\nconsidered in relation to the statute on its face\"); Smith, 538 U.S.\n\nat 107 (Souter, J., concurring) (distinguishing between cases where\n\nthe legislative intent is clear and those where it is ambiguous, and\n\nrejecting the \"clearest proof\" burden where it is ambiguous).\n\nAccordingly, I would approach the application of the Mendoza-\n\nMartinez factors, without any starting presumption, to determine\n\nwhether the actual purpose or effect of Article 120 is punitive.\n\nSee Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. at 168-69.                 Applying the most\n\nrelevant of these factors to the inquiry before us, I find that each\n\nof them weighs in favor of recognizing Article 120 to be a penal\n\nmeasure subject to the Ex Post Facto Clause.\n\n                          1.   Scienter & Criminality\n\n                The third and fifth Mendoza-Martinez factors, \"whether\n\nthe challenged sanction comes into place only on a finding of\n\nscienter,\" and relatedly, \"whether the behavior to which it applies\n\nis already a crime,\" weigh heavily in favor of concluding that\n\n\n                                       -84-\n\fArticle 120 is a penal statute.         See id. at 168.     First of all, \"the\n\ndisciplinary sanction here [is] triggered by a criminal conviction\n\nwhich incorporate[s] a finding of criminal intent, and so the\n\ndisciplinary      sanction   came   into    play   'only    on   a   finding   of\n\nscienter,'\"    Porter v. Coughlin, 421 F.3d 141, 147 (2d Cir. 2005)\n\n(quoting Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. at 168).          Similarly, as Article\n\n120 applies only to persons who have already been convicted of a\n\nfelony, \"the behavior to which it applies is [undoubtedly] already\n\na crime,\" as the fifth Mendoza-Martinez factor requires.               Mendoza-\n\nMartinez, 372 U.S. at 168; see also Dep't of Revenue of Montana v.\n\nKurth Ranch, 511 U.S. 767, 781 (1994) (noting that fact that a tax\n\non marijuana was \"conditioned on the commission of a crime\" is\n\n\"'significant of [its] penal and prohibitory intent'\").\n\n                        2.    History\n\n            The    second    Mendoza-Martinez      factor    asks    whether   a\n\nparticular sanction has \"historically been regarded as punishment.\"\n\nId. at 168.    There is substantial evidence to this effect.              First\n\nof   all,   federal    courts   have     frequently    characterized      felon\n\ndisenfranchisement as a punitive measure.              In its decision in\n\nJohnson, the Eleventh Circuit described felon disenfranchisement\n\nlaws as a \"punitive device stemming from criminal law\" and explained\n\nthat \"throughout history, criminal disenfranchisement provisions\n\nhave existed as a punitive device.\"           See 405 F.3d at 1228 & n.5.\n\nSimilarly, the Second Circuit has noted the \"nearly universal use\n\n\n                                     -85-\n\fof felon disenfranchisement as a punitive device.\" Muntaqim v.\n\nCoombe, 366 F.3d 102, 123 (2d Cir. 2004) (vacated en banc on other\n\ngrounds).   \"Congress [has also] recognized the punitive nature of\n\nfelon disenfranchisement laws.\"        See Pamela A. Wilkins, The Mark of\n\nCain: Disenfranchised Felons and the Constitutional No Man's Land,\n\n56 Syracuse L. Rev. 85, 133-34 (2005) (describing how Congressional\n\nacts readmitting former Confederate States to the Union did so on\n\nthe condition that States prohibited disenfranchisement \"except as\n\na punishment for . . . crimes\").             This point is reinforced by\n\nrenowned historian, Alexander Keyssar's review of voting rights in\n\nthis country in which he unequivocally characterizes America's felon\n\ndisenfranchisement laws as an intentionally punitive device.                Id.\n\n(citing Alexander Keyssar, The Right to Vote: The Contested History\n\nof Democracy in the United States 316 (2000)).           And the ALI's Model\n\nPenal Code, a compilation examining the penal law of the United\n\nStates, labels prisoner disenfranchisement \"an integral part of the\n\ncriminal law.\"      Model Penal Code § 306.3 (Proposed Official Draft\n\n1962). This is strong evidence that, regardless of how a particular\n\ndisenfranchisement        provision    is    codified,    the    purpose    of\n\ndisenfranchising felons in American history has been to punish them\n\nfor their crimes.\n\n            There    is    also   substantial    evidence,      presented   by\n\nplaintiffs, of the historical use of felon disenfranchisement as a\n\npenal mechanism throughout the world.         See Hayden, 449 F.3d at 315-\n\n\n\n                                      -86-\n\f16 (describing use of \"civil death\" laws in Medieval continental\n\nEurope, \"attainder\" laws in medieval England, and \"infamy\" laws in\n\nancient Greece and Rome, all of which revoked political rights,\n\nincluding the right to vote, \"as additional punishment for [certain]\n\ncrimes\");    Keyssar,    supra,   at    62-63   (\"Disenfranchisement       for\n\n[infamous] crimes had a long history in English, European, and even\n\nRoman law, and it [is] hardly surprising that the principle of\n\nattaching civil disabilities to the commission of crimes appeared\n\nin American law as well.\").       Although the district court dismissed\n\nthis evidence as not relevant to disenfranchisement provisions in\n\nAmerican history, that approach misreads this factor as used in\n\nMendoza-Martinez.     In fact, in Mendoza-Martinez itself, the Supreme\n\nCourt explicitly relied on the history of citizenship deprivation\n\nin other countries in determining that the challenged law depriving\n\ndraft evaders of citizenship was punitive in effect.          See 372 U.S.\n\nat   168   n.23   (discussing   Roman   and   English   societies'   use    of\n\nforfeiting citizenship as a punishment).           Thus, evidence of the\n\nhistorical use of felony disenfranchisement laws both in this\n\ncountry and others is relevant, and both reveal the prevalent\n\nhistoric use of such laws as a penal mechanism.\n\n      To refute the extensive evidence that disenfranchisement laws\n\nhave been historically regarded as punitive, the majority cites one\n\ncourt decision that did not concern the disenfranchisement of\n\nfelons, Trop.      See 365 U.S. at 96-97.        Trop does contain dicta\n\n\n\n                                    -87-\n\fsuggesting   hypothetically       that    \"the   purpose   of   [a   felon\n\ndisenfranchisement statute] is to designate a reasonable ground of\n\neligibility for voting,\" id., but as dicta, that language is not\n\nbinding upon us.   See Wilkins, supra, at 102 (arguing that \"Trop's\n\ndiscussion of disenfranchisement statutes was dicta and, therefore,\n\ndoes not excuse judges from the hard work necessary to analyze real\n\ndisenfranchisement laws\").       Trop also explains alternatively, that\n\nif \"[disenfranchisement] were imposed for the purpose of punishing\n\n[an offender], the statute[] would be penal.\"         365 U.S. at 96-97.\n\nMoreover, that decision says nothing about how such laws have\n\nhistorically been regarded.      In any event, the problem with relying\n\non Trop's suggestion that felon disenfranchisement could be a\n\n\"reasonable ground of eligibility for voting,\" is that Trop fails\n\nto reveal what legitimate purpose disenfranchisement serves that\n\nwould render it a \"reasonable ground.\" This failure to identify why\n\ndisqualifying felons is      a   \"reasonable ground\" is particularly\n\nproblematic in light of the fact that both cases cited by Trop for\n\nthis proposition, Davis v. Beason and Murphy v. Ramsey, involve\n\nvoting qualifications that are no longer regarded as valid.43          As\n\n     43\n       See Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 634 (1996) (holding that\nthe decision of the Court in Davis v. Beason, 133 U.S. 333 (1890),\nwhich upheld the disenfranchisement of polygamists on grounds that\nthey advocate \"practical resistance to the laws of the Territory\"\nand \"approve the commission of crimes forbidden by it\" is \"no\nlonger good law\" because \"persons advocating a certain practice may\n[not] be denied the right to vote\"). Murphy v. Ramsey, 114 U.S. 15\n(1885), involved a suit similar to Davis in which the Supreme Court\nupheld a voting qualification disqualifying any \"polygamist,\nbigamist, or any person cohabiting with more than one woman . . .\"\n\n                                   -88-\n\fseveral scholars argue, Trop       was     decided at a time when the\n\ngovernment    had   virtually   unrestricted   power   to   regulate   the\n\nfranchise, prior to the Warren's court's curtailment of that power\n\nwhen it recognized the fundamental nature of voting rights.            See\n\nWilkins, supra, at 102-04; Pamela S. Karlan, Convictions and Doubts:\n\nRetribution,     Representation,     and     the   Debate    Over   Felon\n\nDisenfranchisement, 56 Stan. L. Rev. 1147, 1150-54 (2004). As such,\n\nscholars argue that the dicta in Trop regarding the regulatory\n\nnature of felon disenfranchisement laws was premised on an \"outdated\n\nconception of voting rights,\" rendering its continued validity\n\nquestionable.    Wilkins, supra, at 102-04.\n\n             Thus, seeing sparse evidence to the contrary, I am\n\npersuaded that the evidence cited by plaintiffs of the historical\n\nuse of disenfranchisement weighs in favor of deeming the practice\n\nto be a punitive device.\n\n                       3.   Affirmative Disability or Restraint\n\n             In light of this country's struggle for independence in\n\npursuit of participatory democracy and the centrality attributed to\n\n\n\n\nfrom voting in Utah. Id. at 38, 42-43. Though Murphy was not\nexpressly overruled by name, as was Davis in Romer, it is evident,\ngiven the similarity between the Davis and Murphy challenges, that\nneither decision continues to represent valid law. The rejection\nof this line of cases suggests that keeping \"undesirable\" persons,\nincluding felons, from voting is no longer a valid regulatory\npurpose.\n\n                                   -89-\n\fthe right to vote in our legal and political culture,44 I am\n\ncompelled to conclude that the deprivation of the franchise is an\n\n\"affirmative disability or restraint\" of the gravest sort.\n\n             Yet the majority concludes otherwise.          In support of its\n\nholding that felon disenfranchisement does not constitute criminal\n\npunishment, the majority concludes that Article 120 does not impose\n\n\"any affirmative disability or restraint, physical or otherwise.\"\n\nTo the extent the majority suggests that a restraint need be\n\n\"physical\"     in   order   to    resemble   a   punitive   sanction,    such   a\n\nrequirement simply does not exist. Rather, Smith discusses physical\n\nrestraints as only one kind of possible restraint a criminal law\n\nmight impose.       Smith, 538 U.S. at 100.            In fact, our society\n\nregularly punishes wrongdoers without actually imposing physical\n\nrestraints on them, most commonly, with criminal fines. And Supreme\n\nCourt decisions tasked with applying the Mendoza-Martinez factors\n\nto ascertain the penal or regulatory nature of a particular sanction\n\nhave regularly found non-physical sanctions to be affirmative\n\ndisabilities or restraints. See, e.g., Kurth Ranch, 511 U.S. at 774\n\n(holding a tax on illegal drugs to be a punitive measure in part\n\nbecause   it    \"allowed    for    sanctions     by   restraint   of    Debtors'\n\nproperty\").     In fact, Mendoza-Martinez itself held a non-physical\n\n\n\n\n     44\n        See Werme v. Merrill, 84 F.3d 479, 482 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"It\nis apodictic that the right to vote is a right that helps to\npreserve all other rights.\").\n\n                                      -90-\n\fsanction, the deprivation of citizenship, to constitute a sanction\n\n\"essentially penal in character.\"\n\n             The majority also argues that disenfranchisement during\n\nincarceration is not an affirmative disability because it is \"not\n\nas enduring as permanent occupational debarment.\" See Hawker v. New\n\nYork, 170 U.S. 189 (1898) (holding that revocation of medical\n\nlicense does not violate the Ex Post Facto clause).                 But revoking\n\na license to practice a particular profession is also not the\n\ndeprivation of a fundamental right.           In holding the revocation of\n\ncitizenship rights to be punitive in Mendoza-Martinez, the Supreme\n\nCourt emphasized that it is the \"utmost import\" and \"value\" of\n\ncitizenship rights that renders their deprivation among the gravest\n\nof sanctions.     Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. at 160.          Like citizenship\n\nitself,     the right to vote, a fundamental component of citizenship,\n\nis    certainly   comparable    in   its    utmost   value    and    importance.\n\nTashjian v. Republican Party, 479 U.S. 208, 217 (1986) (noting that\n\nthe right to vote is a fundamental right inherent in citizenship).\n\nIt is the importance of the right to vote that renders the gravity\n\nof its deprivation so devastating a \"disability.\"                 See Reynolds v.\n\nSims, 377 U.S. 533, 555 (1964) (\"The right to vote freely for the\n\ncandidate of one's choice is of the essence of a democratic society,\n\nand   any   restrictions   on   that   right    strikes      at    the   heart   of\n\nrepresentative government.\"); Igartúa-De La Rosa v. United States,\n\n417 F.3d 145, 177 (1st Cir. 2005) (Torruella, J., dissenting)\n\n\n\n                                     -91-\n\f(\"There are few countries in the world in which the right to vote\n\nis as exalted as it is in the United States.\"); McLaughlin v. City\n\nof Canton, 947 F. Supp. 954, 971 (S. D. Miss. 1995) (describing\n\ndisenfranchisement as the harshest sanction imposed by a democratic\n\nsociety and noting that when one is \"brought beneath its axe, the\n\ndisenfranchised is severed from the body politic and condemned to\n\nthe lowest form of citizenship, where voiceless at the ballot box\n\nthe disenfranchised, the disinherited must sit idly by while others\n\nelect his civic leaders and while others choose the fiscal and\n\ngovernmental    policies   that   will    govern    him     and   his   family\").\n\nDisenfranchisement, though neither physical nor permanent, deprives\n\nU.S. citizens of a fundamental right, and as such, is undoubtedly\n\nan affirmative disability.\n\n                      4.    Traditional Aims of Punishment\n\n          The    fourth    Mendoza-Martinez        factor    provides     that   a\n\nsanction is more likely punitive if \"its operation will promote the\n\ntraditional    aims of punishment - retribution and deterrence.\"\n\nMendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. at 168; see also Bell v. Wolfish, 441\n\nU.S. 520, 539 (1979) (noting that the Supreme Court has established\n\nthat \"[r]etribution and deterrence are not legitimate nonpunitive\n\ngovernmental objectives\" (emphasis added)).45 Of course, the threat\n\n\n     45\n        See also Wilkins, supra, at 133 & n.316 (noting that in his\nhistory of American suffrage, Alexander Keyssar characterized felon\ndisenfranchisement laws as intentionally punitive, noting that\n\"disenfranchisement, whether permanent or for an extended period,\nserves as retribution for committing a crime and as a deterrent to\n\n                                   -92-\n\fof being deprived of a fundamental right will, to a certain extent,\n\nalways operate to deter a rational person from engaging in unlawful\n\nconduct.46   But as the Supreme Court has recognized, the deterrent\n\neffect of a sanction cannot be wholly dispositive of criminal\n\npunishment as all civil penalties have some deterrent effect.     See\n\nKurth Ranch, 511 U.S. at 777.     It is, however, in its retributive\n\nnature that felon disenfranchisement truly reveals its punitive\n\ncolors.        See   Karlan,    supra,   at    1166   (arguing   that\n\n\"disenfranchisement really can be justified only under a retributive\n\ntheory of criminal punishment\").     In this sense, this factor also\n\nconclusively weighs in favor of the plaintiffs.\n\n             As a form of retribution, \"'[p]unishment is the way in\n\nwhich society expresses its denunciation of wrongdoing.'\"     Gregg v.\n\nGeorgia, 428 U.S. 153, 184 n.30.

Low et. al.,\n\n\nfuture criminal behavior\").\n      46\n         That some of Article 120's proponents considered this\npossibility is evident from statements such as that of Governor\nCelucci in his letter in support of the disenfranchisement\namendment:\n\n             The time has come to tell would be criminals\n             in Massachusetts that committing crimes has\n             serious consequences, not only in terms of\n             prison time, but also in terms of the right to\n             participate in deciding how society should be\n             run.\n\n(Emphasis added). This language suggests that the proposal was\nintended to deter \"would be\" criminals from committing crimes.\n\n                                 -93-\n\fCriminal Law 2 (1982).        \"This . . . conception of punishment . . .\n\nmakes primary the meting out to a responsible wrongdoer of his just\n\ndeserts.\"      H.L.A. Hart, Punishment and Responsibility, 158-59\n\n(1968).     Other scholars have characterized the retributive aim of\n\ncriminal punishment as predicated upon the notion of restoring the\n\nstatus quo after an offender, by his contravention of the law, has\n\nusurped from his victim or from society generally, something to\n\nwhich he is not fairly entitled.          See, e.g., Herbert Morris, Guilt\n\nand Innocence, 33-36 (1976) (characterizing punishment as restoring\n\nthe fair distribution of benefits and burdens that is displaced when\n\na person violates the rules that others have assumed, thereby\n\ngaining an unfair advantage); Jean Hampton, Retributivism and Its\n\nCritics (1992) (characterizing retributive punishment as a message\n\nthat restores the prior status hierarchy between victim and offender\n\nwhich was violated by an offender's degradation of a victim's worth\n\nthrough criminality).\n\n             In the context of the retributive purposes of criminal\n\npunishment,    it   becomes    apparent     how   fundamentally   intertwined\n\ncriminal disenfranchisement laws generally, and Article 120 in\n\nparticular, are with this punitive objective.            The statement from\n\nGovernor     Cellucci's       letter,     referenced    supra,     that   the\n\ndisenfranchisement proposal would \"ensure that criminals pay their\n\ndebt to society\" is the textbook articulation of the retributive\n\ntheory. Similarly, Representative Frost's statement that felons do\n\n\n\n                                     -94-\n\fnot \"deserve to vote\" is fundamentally linked to the retributive\n\nnotion of \"just deserts.\"          And Representative Marini's promise that\n\nthe law would apply to those who did \"despicable things\" is\n\nconsistent with theory of retributive punishment as a means by which\n\nsociety expresses its moral denunciation of unlawful conduct.\n\n             Moreover,      even     the     statements    contained     in     the\n\nInformation       for   Voters    guide,    cited    by   the    Commonwealth    as\n\nevidencing a regulatory non-punitive purpose, in fact, reveal the\n\nopposite when considered in the context of criminal punishment\n\ntheory.     For example, the statement that Article 120 would change\n\nthe law that \"allows criminals to continue to exercise control over\n\nour lives by voting from prison,\" is consistent with Morris' and\n\nHampton's notions of retributive punishment as a means of restoring\n\nthe proper hierarchy between the offender and society, unfairly\n\ntipped in the offender's favor by his desecration of society's\n\nrules.      By    preventing     offenders    from    benefitting    further,    at\n\nsociety's        expense,   through        their     political    participation,\n\ndisenfranchisement helps to restore that lost equilibrium. Finally,\n\nfelon disenfranchisement laws, by \"deny[ing] the civic and human\n\ndignity of persons who have been convicted of doing wrong,\" are\n\nemblematic of the denunciatory function of criminal law.                See Bell,\n\n441 U.S. at 592-93 n.26 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (citing letter\n\nfrom Learned Hand to the University of Chicago Law Review).\n\n\n\n\n                                       -95-\n\f                          5.    Connection to Non-Punitive Purpose\n\n            The   sixth    Mendoza-Martinez      factor     asks    \"whether    an\n\nalternative    purpose     to    which    [the   challenged       sanction]    may\n\nrationally be connected is assignable for it.\"            372 U.S. at 168-69.\n\n            I note, as a threshold matter and as discussed above,\n\nthat there was no legitimate non-punitive purpose expressly assigned\n\nto Article 120, and that the purpose of the statute as revealed by\n\nits legislative history is primarily punitive.            But even if we were\n\nto speculate as to non-punitive rationales potentially assignable\n\nto the provision, I simply cannot agree with the majority that there\n\nis    an      \"obvious         rational      non-punitive         purpose      for\n\ndisenfranchisement.\"       The reality is that \"[c]ourts have been hard\n\npressed to define the state interest served by laws disenfranchising\n\npersons convicted of crimes.\"        Dillenburg v. Kramer, 469 F.2d 1222,\n\n1224-25    (9th   Cir.     1972)    (\"Appellee     does     not    explain     why\n\ndisenfranchisement of those convicted of offenses that can result\n\nin confinement in state prison is 'necessary' to vindicate any\n\nidentified state interest.\"); see also Stephens v. Yeomans, 327 F.\n\nSupp. 1182, 1188 (D.N.J. 1970) (striking down New Jersey felon\n\ndisenfranchisement law because court \"perceive[d] no rational basis\n\nfor the . . . classification\" of felons as a group that could not\n\nvote).\n\n            My reading of the legislative history of Article 120,\n\nmuch of which indicates a punitive motivation, and the lack of a\n\n\n                                      -96-\n\fsufficient rational nexus to any non-punitive purpose, suggest that\n\nany purported regulatory motivations are, in fact, disingenuous.\n\nMoreover,     the    potential   non-punitive    rationales   for   felon\n\ndisenfranchisement are, in many cases, now regarded as illegitimate\n\ngrounds for restricting the vote, and as such, should not be\n\ncredited.     See Trop, 356 U.S. at 96 (holding that a statute is\n\nnon-penal \"if       it   imposes a disability, not to punish but to\n\naccomplish some other legitimate governmental purpose.\" (emphasis\n\nadded)).     That leaves criminal punishment as the only legitimate\n\ndiscernible \"legislative aim\" behind Article 120.       I will consider,\n\nin   turn,   the    various   non-punitive   justifications   potentially\n\nassignable to Article 120 and explain why each cannot be rationally\n\nassignable to it.\n\n             First, the majority suggests that the \"obvious rational\n\nnon-punitive purpose for disenfranchisement\" is the concern about\n\nfelons \"exercis[ing] control over [people's] lives by voting from\n\nprison.\"     But as explained supra, this concern actually boils down\n\nto the punitive sentiment that felons do not \"deserve\" to do so.\n\n             Second, the Commonwealth argues, on appeal, that the\n\npurpose of Article 120, evidenced by its placement alongside other\n\nvalid voter qualifications in the Massachusetts constitution, was\n\nto exempt from the franchise those persons \"deem[ed] unfit to vote,\"\n\nsuch as minors, persons under guardianships, and persons convicted\n\nof corrupt election practices. That argument rests on the principle\n\n\n\n                                    -97-\n\fthat, due to their lack of respect for the criminal law, felons,\n\nlike minors and mentally incompetent persons, \"have raised questions\n\nabout their ability to vote responsibly,\" and therefore, \"cannot be\n\ntrusted\" to do so.      Given the absence of any reference to voter\n\n\"competence\" in the legislative history of Article 120, and the weak\n\nconnection between disenfranchising incarcerated felons and the\n\nalleged interest in responsible voting, I am inclined to dismiss\n\nthis explanation as a pre-textual rationale masking a punitive\n\npurpose.    See Hendricks, 521 U.S. at 371 (Kennedy, J., concurring)\n\n(\"If the object or purpose of the Kansas law had been to provide\n\ntreatment but the treatment provisions were adopted as a sham or\n\nmere pretext, there would have been an indication of the forbidden\n\npurpose to punish.\").       This is because disenfranchising felons is\n\nboth under and over-inclusive of this alleged rationale.                   It is\n\nunder-inclusive because if persons who violate the law have shown\n\nthat they cannot vote responsibly, then not only incarcerated\n\nfelons, but all persons who commit any kind of crime should be\n\ndisenfranchised, whether they are serving a custodial sentence or\n\nnot.      Moreover,   all   citizens   who   for    any   reason    have     shown\n\nthemselves to be irresponsible voters should be disenfranchised as\n\nwell.      It is over-inclusive because some incarcerated felons,\n\ndespite     their   prior   transgressions,        may    have,    through    the\n\nrehabilitative elements of their sentence, developed great respect\n\nfor society's rules.        While it is true that \"[a] statute is not\n\n\n\n                                   -98-\n\fdeemed punitive simply because it lacks a close or perfect fit with\n\nthe non-punitive aims it seeks to advance,\" Smith, 538 U.S. at 102-\n\n03   (emphasis       added),    the   connection     here    seems    especially\n\nattenuated, especially in light of the fundamental right that is at\n\nstake.        This   suggests    that    the    concern     with   felons    being\n\n\"unqualified\" is \"simply a fictional concern advanced to mask a\n\npunitive purpose.\"        United States v. Brown, 381 U.S. 437, 446-47\n\n(White, J., dissenting).\n\n              More importantly, I question whether the Commonwealth can\n\nrely on a felon's purported incapacity to vote responsibly as the\n\n\"non-punitive rationale\" for Article 120 given that neither the\n\nability to vote responsibly nor respect for the existing law remain\n\n\"reasonable ground[s] of eligibility for voting.\" See Trop, 356 U.S.\n\nat   96-97.     Rather,    the   idea    that   a   particular     group    may   be\n\ndisqualified from voting based on a lack of respect for existing\n\ncriminal law now constitutes a form of viewpoint discrimination that\n\nhas been expressly rejected. See, e.g., Romer, 517 U.S. at 634 (see\n\nparenthetical, supra, n.19); Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 354-56\n\n(1972) (rejecting durational residency requirements that rested on\n\nclaims about the desirability of ensuring that citizens understood,\n\nand shared, community values before they were permitted to vote);\n\nsee also Carrington v. Rash, 380 U.S. 89, 94 (1965) (\"'Fencing out'\n\nfrom the franchise a sector of the population because of the way\n\nthey may vote is constitutionally impermissible.\"). Thus, according\n\n\n\n                                        -99-\n\fto one scholar, \"contemporary voting rights doctrine casts a serious\n\nshadow on the central traditional non-penal justification for felon\n\ndisenfranchisement: the claim that ex-offenders              should not be\n\npermitted to vote because they lack the qualities of mind or\n\ncharacter voters ought to possess.\"         Karlan, supra, at 1152.\n\n           Third, a similar analysis applies to the purported non-\n\npunitive \"regulatory\" purpose arbitrarily assigned to Article 120\n\nby the district court.      The district court suggested that prisoners\n\nare somehow unqualified to participate in the \"participatory and\n\ncollegial process\" of \"representative democracy\" because they \"have\n\nlimited access to information and little opportunity to discuss\n\nissues with individuals who are not also being punished for breaking\n\nthe law.\" Not only is this \"inability-to-become-informed\" rationale\n\nentirely absent from the discussions motivating the enactment of\n\nArticle   120,   but   it   is   simply   not   rationally   connected   with\n\ndisenfranchising the entire convicted felon population, many of whom\n\nmay very well have access to newspapers, media, and contact to\n\noutside visitors, as well as the leisure time to become politically\n\ninformed, and thereby, even more knowledgeable voters than law-\n\nabiding persons on the \"outside.\"         But again, and more importantly,\n\nthe Supreme Court has consistently rejected restrictions on the\n\nfranchise in order to further \"knowledgeable or intelligent voting.\"\n\nSee, e.g., Dunn, 405 U.S. at 356.               Thus, \"[i]f neither good\n\ncharacter nor intelligent use of the ballot nor support for existing\n\n\n\n                                    -100-\n\fcriminal laws are generally permissible prerequisites for voting,\n\nthen it would be perverse to rely on criminal convictions as\n\nevidence   that      individuals    lack    qualities    that    voters    are   not\n\nrequired   to     have.\"     Karlan,       supra,   at   1155.     \"The    obvious\n\nalternative     is    to   conclude   that    disenfranchisement      is    indeed\n\npunitive and that if it is to be justified, it must be justified as\n\na legitimate form of punishment, rather than as a species of\n\npolitical regulation.\"        Id.\n\n           Finally, that this \"alternative purpose\" factor of the\n\nMendoza-Martinez analysis weighs in favor of deeming Article 120 a\n\npunitive sanction is bolstered by examining what has been found to\n\nconstitute a \"legitimate non-punitive purpose\" in prior Mendoza-\n\nMartinez cases, and what has not.             That examination reveals that\n\nthose cases holding particular sanctions to constitute non-punitive\n\nregulatory measures have served far clearer and more substantial\n\nsocietal interests than the attenuated justifications provided for\n\nfelon disenfranchisement.           For example, in Hendricks, the state\n\ncivil commitment law held to be non-punitive was intended to protect\n\nthe public from dangerous mentally ill persons \"likely to engage in\n\n'predatory acts of sexual violence.'\"           521 U.S. at 350.      Similarly,\n\nAlaska's sexual offender registration requirement, held                     to   be\n\nnon-punitive in Smith, had the express purpose of \"protecting the\n\npublic from sex offenders\" who \"pose a high risk of reoffending.\"\n\n538 U.S. at 93; see also United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 747\n\n\n\n                                      -101-\n\f(1987) (holding that preventative detention under Bail Reform Act,\n\njustified by the need to prevent \"danger to the community,\" was\n\nregulatory and preventative, rather than punitive).\n\n             On the other hand, the provision being challenged before\n\nus bears a far greater resemblance to the one at issue in Mendoza-\n\nMartinez itself. In Mendoza-Martinez, where \"there was no reference\n\nto the societal good that would be wrought by the legislation,\" the\n\nSupreme Court concluded that \"the obvious inference\" was that\n\n\"Congress was concerned solely with inflicting effective retribution\n\nupon this class of draft evaders and, no doubt, on others similarly\n\nsituated.\"    Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. at 182; see also Trop, 356\n\nU.S. at 97-98 (holding that statute stripping military deserters of\n\ncitizenship rights cannot rationally be treated other than as a\n\npenal law).    Finding no legitimate non-penal interest served by the\n\nlegislation, the Supreme Court in Mendoza-Martinez did not go on to\n\nspeculate as to potential alternative justifications.            But even if\n\nit had, the conceivable legitimate non-penal justification for\n\nstripping an American of his citizenship rights for violating a\n\ncriminal statute prohibiting the evasion of military service, as in\n\nMendoza-Martinez    and   Trop,   is   no   more   substantial    than   the\n\nconceivable justifications for stripping a U.S. citizen of an\n\nessential component of those rights (i.e. voting), for violating\n\nanother criminal statute.         Of course, one could argue that by\n\nabandoning the obligations of citizenship by evading the military\n\n\n\n                                   -102-\n\fobligations attendant thereto, a person shows that he is not\n\n\"competent\" to exercise the benefits and burdens of citizenship,\n\njust like one could argue that a person who breaches the criminal\n\nlaw shows that he is not competent to exercise the responsibility\n\nof aiding in its enactment.        But the Supreme Court has refused to\n\nmake this leap, and neither should we here.          Given the similarities\n\nbetween the respective sanctions47 -- deprivation of citizenship and\n\ndeprivation of voting rights -- the lack of any clear non-punitive\n\ninterest for either sanction, and the similar triggering event for\n\nthe imposition of each, namely, violation of a criminal law, I think\n\nwe are compelled by Mendoza-Martinez to hold Article 120 to be a\n\npenal measure.     Finding Article 120 to be a penal measure, its\n\nconstitutionality is subject to the constraints of the Ex Post Facto\n\nClause, and violates that clause as retroactively applied to the\n\nplaintiffs.\n\n           To be abundantly clear, I see nothing constitutionally\n\nimpermissible about disenfranchising felons as a form of criminal\n\npunishment.      Criminals   who   are   convicted    of   serious   offenses\n\npursuant to a legitimate process are properly deprived by the state\n\n\n     47\n         See Nw. Austin, 557 U.S. at ___, 2009 WL 1738645 at *7\n(describing \"the right to vote\" as \"one of the most fundamental\nrights our citizens\"); Tashjian, 479 U.S. at 217; Wolfish, 441\nU.S. at 589-90 & n.22 (Stevens, J. dissenting) (noting that \"[t]he\nwithdrawal of rights is itself among the most basic punishments\nthat society can exact, for such a withdrawal qualifies the\nsubject's citizenship and violates his dignity\" and citing\ndisenfranchisement as the \"classic example of the coincidence of\npunishment and the total deprivation of rights\").\n\n                                    -103-\n\fof a panoply of fundamental individual and civil rights.        But\n\n\"punishment\" must be labeled what it is, and imposed only in\n\ncompliance with the time-honored constitutional guarantees that\n\nlegitimate the exercise of that practice.      Central among these\n\nguarantees is the prohibition against the enactment of ex post facto\n\nlaws.   As Article 120 inflicts a greater punishment upon convicted\n\nfelons than the law annexed to their crimes when committed, see\n\nCalder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 390 (1798), I would invalidate its\n\nretroactive application.   Thus, I would reverse the decision of the\n\ndistrict court as to the ex post facto claim, and order that\n\njudgment be entered for plaintiffs.\n\n           For the reasons herein stated, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                               -104-\n\f",

Cornwall, and Edwards Angell Palmer &amp; Dodge, LLP were on brief for appellee/cross-appellant.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, Chief Judge, TORRUELLA and BOUDIN, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>LYNCH, Chief Judge.</p>\n<p>By nearly a two-to-one margin in the year 2000, Massachusetts voters passed Article 120, which amended the state constitution to disqualify currently incarcerated felons from voting in certain elections. Shortly thereafter, the state legislature extended this disqualification by statute, Chapter 150, to prevent inmates from voting in all Massachusetts elections.</p>\n<p>In 2001, several incarcerated felons in state custody, challenged these provisions (collectively \"Article 120\") by suing the Secretary of the Commonwealth in federal court. This appeal concerns two of their claims: (1) that the Commonwealth's disenfranchisement provisions violated the Voting Rights Act (\"VRA\") § 2, 42 U.S.C. § 1973, because the percentage of imprisoned felons who are Hispanic or African-American is higher than the percentages of those groups in the population of the state; and (2) that the provisions violated the Ex Post Facto Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, § 10, as to those inmates who were not disqualified from voting before the these provisions took effect. As to their claim under the VRA, the plaintiffs make no allegation of any intentional discrimination or of any history by Massachusetts of intentional discrimination against minority voters. All they have claimed is that past practices in the Massachusetts criminal justice system produced inmate populations which, in combination with the disqualification of inmates imprisoned for felonies, have resulted in disproportionate disqualification of minorities from voting. Theirs is a claim of disparate impact.</p>\n<p>After allowing initial discovery, the district court in 2007 denied the Commonwealth's motion for entry of judgment on the pleadings on plaintiffs' VRA claim but granted the Commonwealth's motion for summary judgment on the Ex Post Facto Clause argument.</p>\n<p>We think it clear from the language, history, and context of the VRA that Congress never intended § 2 to prohibit the states from disenfranchising currently incarcerated felons. We do not say that direct vote denial claims of other types may not be brought under § 2, only that no VRA claim is stated against a state law which disenfranchises incarcerated felons. We reverse and order the dismissal of the VRA § 2 claim. We affirm the grant of summary judgment on the Ex Post Facto claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Enactment of the Massachusetts Incarcerated Felon Disenfranchisement Provisions</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Before Article 120 was enacted, prisoners were able to vote by absentee ballot. In 1997, there was an unsuccessful proposal for legislation to disenfranchise currently <span class=\"star-pagination\">*27</span> incarcerated persons for certain felonies: murder, rape, other sex-related offenses, and controlled substances offenses. Massachusetts prisoners responded by forming a political action committee (\"PAC\"), aimed at influencing criminal justice issues, including sentencing, prison reform, and \"Draconian laws on punishment.\" PACs, inter alia, raise money for and endorse candidates.</p>\n<p>State elected officials reacted swiftly. On August 12, 1997, then-Acting Governor Cellucci proposed a constitutional amendment that would disenfranchise all incarcerated individuals (not just felons), saying:</p>\n<blockquote>Criminals behind bars have no business deciding who should govern the law-abiding citizens of the Commonwealth. This proposed amendment will ensure that criminals pay their debt to society before they regain their right to participate in the political process.</blockquote>\n<p>The legislature did not act on this proposal. Rather, the legislature approved a different proposed amendment that would disenfranchise only those currently incarcerated for felonies. Lawmakers received the legal opinions of House and Senate Counsel that such an alternative amendment would be constitutional under the U.S. Constitution.</p>\n<p>Article 120, the proposed amendment to Article 3 of the Amendments to the state constitution, was presented to the voters along with an Information for Voters Guide. That Guide constitutes relevant legislative history. The Guide included 150-word arguments written by proponents and opponents of each ballot question. The statement from the proponents stated, \"A yes vote prevents criminals serving time for a felony conviction from voting in Massachusetts's elections while in jail.\" The proponents argued:</p>\n<blockquote>When someone in Massachusetts is sentenced to jail for committing a felony, we deprive them of their liberty and right to exercise control over their own lives, yet current law allows these same criminals to continue to exercise control over our lives by voting from prison. This amendment will change the law that gives jailed criminals the right to vote.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Massachusetts is one of only three states in our nation where felons serving time may vote while in jail. Voting yes on this important question will make the Commonwealth the 48th state to prohibit the practice of allowing convicted criminals to vote from jail. This change discriminates against no one except jailed criminals.</blockquote>\n<p>The Guide also contained the opponents' argument:</p>\n<blockquote>The Constitution of Massachusetts is clear on this point: Citizens retain their right to vote even while incarcerated. The founders of Massachusetts intended this right, and our Supreme Judicial Court affirmed in in 1977. In the history of the Commonwealth, we have never amended our Constitution in order to narrow fundamental rights. There is no reason to do so now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>No one has alleged that prisoner voting has harmed our democracy or social fabric. Very few prisoners vote, and no one claims that prisoner voting has negatively influenced any election. Stripping incarcerated felons of their right to vote serves no public safety function. It will not deter crime, repair the harm done by crime, nor help to rehabilitate prisoners.</blockquote>\n<p>The voters approved the amendment with 60.3% voting \"yes\" to 33.9% voting \"no,\" and 5.8% of voters not casting a vote on the question. The amendment took effect on December 6, 2000. Article 3 now reads:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*28</span> Every citizen of eighteen years of age and upwards, <i>excepting persons who are incarcerated in a correctional facility due to a felony conviction,</i> and excepting persons under guardianship and persons temporarily or permanently disqualified by law because of corrupt practices in respect to elections who shall have resided within the town or district in which he may claim a right to vote, six calendar months next preceding any election of governor, lieutenant governor, senators or representatives, shall have a right to vote in such election of governor, lieutenant governor, senators and representatives; and no other person shall be entitled to vote in such election.</blockquote>\n<p>Mass. Const. amend. art. 3 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>The Massachusetts legislature then enacted Chapter 150 of the Acts of 2001, which effectuated Article 120 by broadening the ban on felon voting to cover all Massachusetts elections and by changing the statutory requirements for obtaining absentee ballots. Chapter 150 took effect November 27, 2001. Unlike many other states, Massachusetts does not disqualify convicted felons from voting once they are released from prison.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Procedural History of the Litigation</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs Paul Simmons, an African-American, Pedro Valentin, a Hispanic-American, and Dennis J. Beldotti, a Caucasian-American, are Massachusetts residents currently in the custody of the Massachusetts Department of Correction for felonies they committed on or before December 5, 2000. Plaintiffs were eligible to be Massachusetts voters before that date, but the record does not reveal whether they were registered to vote.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs' pro se complaint was amended twice by court-appointed counsel. Their final amended complaint alleged that Article 120 violates § 2 of the VRA because it has a \"disproportionately adverse effect on the voting rights of African-Americans and Hispanic Americans compared to its effect on the voting rights of other citizens.\" This effect \"is caused by, among other things, the facts that African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans are over-represented in the population of Massachusetts incarcerated felons, and that there exists considerable racial and ethnic bias, both direct and subtle, in the Massachusetts court system.\"<sup>[1]</sup> Article 120, plaintiffs contended, \"interact[s] with social and historical conditions to cause an inequality in the opportunities enjoyed by minority and non-minority voters to elect their preferred representatives.\"</p>\n<p>In describing plaintiffs' complaint, which alleges a \"vote denial\" claim, we distinguish vote denial cases from vote dilution<sup>[2]</sup> claims under § 2 of the VRA. The Supreme <span class=\"star-pagination\">*29</span> Court first articulated the distinction in explaining that \"[t]he right to vote can be affected by a <i>dilution</i> of voting power as well as by an absolute prohibition on casting a ballot.\" <i>Shaw v. Reno,</i> 509 U.S. 630, 640, 113 S.Ct. 2816, 125 L.Ed.2d 511 (1993) (quoting <i>Allen v. State Bd. of Elections,</i> 393 U.S. 544, 569, 89 S.Ct. 817, 22 L.Ed.2d 1 (1969)). Thus in voting rights parlance, \"`[v]ote denial' refers to practices that prevent people from voting or having their votes counted.\" D.P. Tokaji, <i>The New Vote Denial: Where Election Reform Meets the Voting Rights Act,</i> 57 S.C. L.Rev. 689, 691 (2006). Vote denial cases challenge practices such as literacy tests, poll taxes, white primaries, and English-only ballots. <i>Id.</i> By contrast, vote dilution challenges involve \"practices that diminish minorities' political influence,\" such as at-large elections and redistricting plans that either weaken or keep minorities' voting strength weak. <i>Id.; see also</i> P.S. Karlan, <i>The Impact of the Voting Rights Act on African Americans, in Voting Rights and Redistricting</i> 121, 122 (M.E. Rush ed., 1998).</p>\n<p>To be clear, plaintiffs did not allege and have disavowed making a § 2 vote dilution claim, such as that the votes of African-Americans and Hispanics who are not imprisoned for felonies have been diluted by Article 120. This case also does not involve any claim that generalized rules or practices governing the administration of elections have resulted in a disproportionate denial of votes of minorities. Further, plaintiffs have not asserted that the state has otherwise created barriers to the election of minority group members or other participation of minorities in the political process. Finally, the plaintiffs' complaint made no allegation that the Commonwealth acted with racially discriminatory intent or purpose in enacting Article 120, and plaintiffs have specifically disavowed any such claim. This is a claim based purely on the allegation that Article 120 has a disparate impact on minorities by disqualifying from voting imprisoned felons.</p>\n<p>In support of their pleadings, the complaint referred to and appended a 1994 Final Report by the Commission to Study Racial and Ethnic Bias in the Courts to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\").<sup>[3]</sup> Plaintiffs alleged the legislators were aware of or should have been aware of the conclusions in that 1994 Report. That 1994 Report, however, was not referenced in or part of the Voters Guide, and there is no claim the voters were aware of it.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs further alleged that Article 120 is punitive in purpose and effect and therefore violates the Ex Post Facto Clause as to those inmates who committed their offenses before the disenfranchisement measures took effect.</p>\n<p>The relief sought was a declaration that Article 120 was unconstitutional under the Ex Post Facto Clause and illegal under § 2 of the VRA, injunctive relief, and costs and attorneys' fees.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*30</span> Plaintiffs unsuccessfully moved for a preliminary injunction; defendant opposed, filing affidavits which described the legislative history of Article 120 and the ratification process. The parties conducted written discovery.<sup>[4]</sup> Defendant then moved for summary judgment as to the Ex Post Facto and equal protection claims and for judgment on the pleadings as to the VRA § 2 claim on January 12, 2007. The plaintiffs opposed the Commonwealth's motions and also cross-moved for summary judgment as to the Ex Post Facto and equal protection claims.</p>\n<p>On August 30, 2007, the district court granted the Commonwealth's motion for summary judgment on the Ex Post Facto Clause claim and the equal protection claim and denied plaintiffs' cross-motion. The court denied the Commonwealth's motion on the VRA claim. On January 16, 2008, the district court certified its order on the VRA claim for interlocutory appeal. Plaintiffs petitioned to cross-appeal on the Ex Post Facto and equal protection claims. This court granted leave to appeal all three claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b). Plaintiffs have abandoned the Equal Protection Clause claim and contest only the Ex Post Facto Clause ruling, and the Commonwealth appeals the denial of its motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the VRA § 2 claims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Standard of Review</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Our review of the court's ruling on both claims is de novo, and we take the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs. <i>Estate of Bennett v. Wainwright,</i> 548 F.3d 155, 163, 165 (1st Cir.2008) (considering dismissals under Rule 12(c) and Rule 56). We treat the denial of a motion for judgment on the pleadings \"much like a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.\" <i>Pérez-Acevedo v. Rivero-Cubano,</i> 520 F.3d 26, 29 (1st Cir.2008).<sup>[5]</sup> \"[T]o survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion (and, by extension, a Rule 12(c) motion) a complaint must contain factual allegations that `raise a right to relief above the speculative level, on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly,</i> 550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1965, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). Nonetheless, questions of statutory interpretation are questions of law ripe for resolution at the pleadings stage. <i>Gen. Motors Corp. v. Darling's,</i> 444 F.3d 98, 107 (1st Cir.2006) (\"Statutory interpretation typically raises questions of law engendering de novo review.\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>VRA § 2 CLAIM</i></h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs' § 2 challenge is to the Massachusetts law disenfranchising only currently incarcerated felons. Article 120 is among the narrowest of state felon disenfranchisement <span class=\"star-pagination\">*31</span> provisions.<sup>[6]</sup> Only two states permit incarcerated felons to vote, and Massachusetts is one of thirteen jurisdictions that limit disenfranchisement to the period of incarceration. Currently, thirty-five states prevent felons from voting during the period of their parole or probation or both. Eleven states disenfranchise felons beyond the term of their incarceration, probation, and parole. Two states disenfranchise felons for life.</p>\n<p>The question of state felon disenfranchisement laws and the VRA § 2 has been addressed by five circuits. Four circuits, including two en banc, have rejected § 2 challenges to broader disqualifications; one panel in the Ninth Circuit had allowed such a § 2 challenge to go forward, although it was ultimately unsuccessful. The Second Circuit, consistent with our holding here, has rejected a § 2 challenge to a state statute disenfranchising prisoners, as well as parolees. <i>Hayden v. Pataki,</i> 449 F.3d 305 (2d Cir.2006) (en banc). Faced with a state lifetime felon disenfranchisement law, the Eleventh Circuit concluded in an en banc decision that all felon disenfranchisement claims are excluded from the scope of § 2 of the VRA. <i>Johnson v. Gov. of Fla.,</i> 405 F.3d 1214 (11th Cir. 2005) (en banc). Two circuits have rejected similar claims on the pleadings without directly considering whether felon disenfranchisement statutes are immune from attack under § 2. <i>Howard v. Gilmore,</i> No. 99-2285, 2000 WL 203984, at *1 (4th Cir. Feb.23, 2000) (per curiam); <i>Wesley v. Collins,</i> 791 F.2d 1255, 1259-61 (6th Cir.1986) (treating claim as a dilution claim). Our conclusion accords with that of the majority of the circuits.</p>\n<p>A Ninth Circuit panel decision has concluded that some disenfranchisement statutes, not as narrow as this one, may be challenged under § 2. <i>Farrakhan v. Washington,</i> 338 F.3d 1009 (9th Cir.2003) (addressing disenfranchisement of those convicted of an \"infamous crime\" until those former felons comply with civil rights restoration statute). Over a dissent by seven judges, the Ninth Circuit denied the state's petition for rehearing en banc in that case, <i>Farrakhan v. Washington,</i> 359 F.3d 1116, 1116 (9th Cir.2004) (Kozinski, J., dissenting). On remand, judgment was entered for the state. <i>Farrakhan v. Gregoire,</i> No. CV-96-076-RHW, 2006 WL 1889273 (E.D.Wash. July 7, 2006).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Constitutional Background to the VRA § 2 Claim</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Under the U.S. Constitution, the states generally set the eligibility criteria for voters. \"[T]he Constitution `does not confer the right of suffrage upon any one.'\" <i>Rodriguez v. Popular Democratic Party,</i> 457 U.S. 1, 9, 102 S.Ct. 2194, 72 L.Ed.2d 628 (1982) (quoting <i>Minor v. Happersett,</i> 88 U.S. (21 Wall.) 162, 178, 22 L.Ed. 627 (1874)); <i>see also</i> U.S. Const. art. I, § 4; <i>id.</i> amend. XIV, § 2; <i>Bush v. Gore,</i> 531 U.S. 98, 104, 121 S.Ct. 525, 148 L.Ed.2d 388 (2000) (per curiam) (\"The individual citizen has no federal constitutional right to vote for electors for the President of the United States unless and until the state legislature chooses a statewide election as the means to implement its power to appoint members of the electoral college.\").</p>\n<p>The criteria for eligibility to vote are defined by the states, subject to certain federal restrictions, such as the federal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*32</span> constitutional prohibition on exclusion from the franchise on the basis of race, sex, or payment of a poll tax. \"No function is more essential to the separate and independent existence of the States and their governments than the power to determine within the limits of the Constitution the qualifications of their own voters for state, county, and municipal offices.\" <i>Oregon v. Mitchell,</i> 400 U.S. 112, 125, 91 S.Ct. 260, 27 L.Ed.2d 272 (1970).</p>\n<p>The power of the states to disqualify from voting those convicted of crimes is explicitly set forth in § 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court has held, \"the exclusion of felons from the vote has an affirmative sanction in § 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" <i>Richardson v. Ramirez,</i> 418 U.S. 24, 55, 94 S.Ct. 2655, 41 L.Ed.2d 551 (1974). Section 2 concerns the abridgement of the right to vote at any election for \"President and Vice President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the Executive and Judicial officers of a State, or members of the Legislature.\" U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 2. The Amendment specifically excludes (from its non-abridgement language) and thus provides for the denial by states of the right to vote to persons \"for participation in rebellion, or other crime.\" <i>Id.</i> The Fourteenth Amendment also grants Congress the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of that article. <i>Id.</i> § 5. Thus, the state's denial of the right to vote to felons has a constitutional grounding.</p>\n<p>Broad felon disenfranchisement provisions are presumptively constitutional. <i>See </i><i>Richardson,</i> 418 U.S. at 54-55, 94 S.Ct. 2655.<sup>[7]</sup> There, the Court rejected a non-race-based equal protection challenge to the felon disenfranchisement provision of California's constitution. The Supreme Court has continued to adhere to <i>Richardson. See </i><i>Romer v. Evans,</i> 517 U.S. 620, 634, 116 S.Ct. 1620, 134 L.Ed.2d 855 (1996) (describing principle that states may disenfranchise a convicted felon as \"unexceptionable\").</p>\n<p><i>Richardson,</i> to be clear, does not hold that a state felon disenfranchisement law may never raise equal protection concerns. If a state enacts a law which disenfranchises felons \"with the intent of disenfranchising blacks,\" that state has run afoul of § 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment. <i>Hunter v. Underwood,</i> 471 U.S. 222, 229, 105 S.Ct. 1916, 85 L.Ed.2d 222 (1985) (holding Alabama's petty crime and misdemeanor disenfranchisement provisions unconstitutional under Equal Protection Clause based on evidence of discriminatory intent); <i>see also </i><i>City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr.,</i> 473 U.S. 432, 477, 105 S.Ct. 3249, n. 25, 87 L.Ed.2d 313 (1985) (\"[In <i>Hunter</i>], we did not suggest that felons could not be deprived of the vote through a statute motivated by some purpose other than racial discrimination.\"). Here, plaintiffs make no allegation of intentional discrimination, and on appeal they allege no constitutional violation other than the Ex Post Facto claim. By definition, then, plaintiffs do not assert that whatever discrimination existed in the state's criminal justice system rose to the level of an independent constitutional violation which caused the vote denial.</p>\n<p>A state's interest in preventing \"persons who ... were not eligible to vote because they had been convicted of felonies\" from inflating its voter rolls was accepted only last year by the Supreme Court as a \"neutral <span class=\"star-pagination\">*33</span> and nondiscriminatory reason\" for a voter identification law. <i>Crawford v. Marion County Election Bd.,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 1610, 1619-20, 170 L.Ed.2d 574 (2008).</p>\n<p>The legitimacy of the reasons for this state interest in disqualifying imprisoned felons from voting is apparent. Judge Henry Friendly some time ago described some of the pragmatic purposes underlying disenfranchisement laws:</p>\n<blockquote>[I]t can scarcely be deemed unreasonable for a state to decide that perpetrators of serious crimes shall not take part in electing the legislators who make the laws, the executives who enforce these, the prosecutors who must try them for further violations, or the judges who are to consider their cases.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Green v. Bd. of Elections,</i> 380 F.2d 445, 451 (2d Cir.1967).<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>Here, the Commonwealth enacted this prohibition after prisoners attempted to organize to change the laws under which they were convicted, sentenced, and imprisoned. The state has a strong interest in setting its own qualifications for voters, a strong interest in the integrity of its system of enforcing and administering its criminal laws, and a strong interest in how its correctional systems are maintained and run. <i>Preiser v. Rodriguez,</i> 411 U.S. 475, 491-92, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973) (\"It is difficult to imagine an activity in which a State has a stronger interest... than the administration of its prisons.\"); <i>cf. </i><i>Hayden,</i> 449 F.3d at 327. The Massachusetts provision, it is important to note, is narrowly tailored. Because the disqualification is confined to currently imprisoned felons, the state interests it serves are clearly at their strongest.</p>\n<p>Further, Article 120 of the Massachusetts constitution does not raise issues about a history of laws in Massachusetts, including felon disenfranchisement laws, that were used deliberately to impede voting by minorities. Such historical concerns about practices in other states have been the subject of academic commentary. <i>See, e.g.,</i> G. Brooks, Comment, <i>Felon Disenfranchisement: Law, History, Policy and Politics,</i> 32 Fordham Urb. L.J. 851, 858-59 (2005) (concluding that the VRA does not reach state felon disenfranchisement laws). Plaintiffs have made no claim that Massachusetts has historically ever used any tests or devices to discourage minority voting or minority candidates. Nor is there any claim that Massachusetts has defined Article 120 disenfranchisement in terms of felonies that have higher conviction rates for minorities than for whites. <i>Cf. </i><i>Hunter,</i> 471 U.S. at 229, 105 S.Ct. 1916.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Text, Context and Legislative History of § 2</i>\n</h2>\n<p>It is against the backdrop of the Constitution's express approval of felon disenfranchisement provisions, which were not motivated by intentional race discrimination, that Congress enacted the VRA in 1965.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*34</span> Section 2 of the VRA, 42 U.S.C. § 1973, as amended in 1982, now provides:</p>\n<blockquote>(a) No voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or applied by any State or political subdivision in a manner which results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(b) A violation of subsection (a) is established if, based on the totality of circumstances, it is shown that the political processes leading to nomination or election in the State or political subdivision are not equally open to participation by members of a class of citizens protected by subsection (a) in that its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.</blockquote>\n<p>While the language of the original § 2 tracked the language of the Fifteenth Amendment, prohibiting practices that deny or abridge the right to vote on account of race, the 1982 amendment to § 2 inserted the phrase \"<i>results</i> in a denial or abridgment.\" § 1973(b) (emphasis added). The amendment of § 2 also made clear that an abridgement or denial could be identified \"as provided in subsection (b),\" which was added by the 1982 amendments.</p>\n<p>To start, it is clear that under the plain terms of the statute, not every \"voter qualification\" is actionable under § 2. For § 2 to apply, the burden is on the plaintiffs to make other showings, including that the qualification \"results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.\" § 1973(a); <i>see also </i><i>Metts v. Murphy,</i> 363 F.3d 8, 12 (1st Cir.2004) (en banc) (per curiam).</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs' theory of how they meet this burden under § 2 is that from the very enactment of § 2 in 1965, the broad language of § 2 has created a cause of action on these facts. Article 120, they contend, is obviously a voter disqualification and the disqualification results in a denial of the right to vote \"on account of race\" because the percentages of incarcerated felons who are black or Hispanic are higher than those two groups in the population as a whole.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs argue the language of § 2(a) is so clear it stands alone and that rules of statutory construction prohibit consideration of the history or context of § 2.<sup>[9]</sup> Plaintiffs' claim assumes that felon disenfranchisement laws are not different from and should be treated like any other voting qualification under § 2. That assumption is a fatal flaw in their case. Felon disenfranchisement statutes are not like all other voting qualifications. Congress has treated such laws differently. They are deeply rooted in our history, in our laws, and in our Constitution. We conclude Congress did not intend § 2 to provide a cause of action against Article 120.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*35</span> As a matter of textual analysis, it is neither plain nor clear that plaintiffs' claim fits within the text of § 2(a). For example, it is logical to understand the state law disenfranchisement of incarcerated felons as not \"resulting\" in a denial \"on account of race or color\" but on account of imprisonment for a felony, and thus not within the text of § 2 at all.<sup>[10]</sup> We agree with the Second Circuit that the language of § 2(a) is both broad and ambiguous and that judicial interpretation of a claim concerning felon disenfranchisement under the VRA may not be limited to the text of § 2(a) alone. <i>See </i><i>Hayden,</i> 449 F.3d at 315 (citing <i>Watt v. Alaska,</i> 451 U.S. 259, 266, 101 S.Ct. 1673, 68 L.Ed.2d 80 (1981); <i>Boston Sand &amp; Gravel Co. v. United States,</i> 278 U.S. 41, 48, 49 S.Ct. 52, 73 L.Ed. 170(1928)).</p>\n<p>Under any set of rules of construction, our inquiry into § 2(a) neither starts nor ends with an examination of that text. \"[S]tatutory interpretation turns on `the language itself, the specific context in which that language is used, and the broader context of the statute as a whole.'\" <i>Nken v. Holder,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 1749, 1756, 173 L.Ed.2d 550 (2009) (quoting <i>Robinson v. Shell Oil Co.,</i> 519 U.S. 337, 341, 117 S.Ct. 843, 136 L.Ed.2d 808 (1997)).</p>\n<p>Under Supreme Court precedent, we cannot adopt plaintiffs' limited approach. The direction to look at context, structure, history, and constitutional concerns is particularly true of the VRA, a complex statute with an extensive legislative history and caselaw. <i>See </i><i>Nw. Austin Mun. Util. Dist. No. 1 v. Holder,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 2504, 2513-14, 174 L.Ed.2d 140 (2009) (\"[S]pecific precedent, the structure of the Voting Rights Act, and underlying constitutional concerns compel a broader reading of the [VRA's] bailout provision.\"). The Supreme Court itself, in deciding § 2 cases has never resorted to plain text alone to give § 2 meaning. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Chisom v. Roemer,</i> 501 U.S. 380, 397, 111 S.Ct. 2354, 115 L.Ed.2d 348 (1991). It has commonly used legislative history. <i>See </i><i>League of United Latin Am. Citizens v.

St. Vincent's Hosp.,</i> 502 U.S. 215, 221, 112 S.Ct. 570, 116 L.Ed.2d 578 (1991). As \"the meaning of statutory language, plain or not, depends on context,\" <i>id.,</i> we must \"look not only to the particular statutory language, but to the design of the statute as a whole and to its object and policy.\" <i>Dada v. Mukasey,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 2307, 2317, 171 L.Ed.2d 178 (2008) (quoting <i>Gozlon-Peretz v.

The purposes and congressional history of the 1982 amendments, as well as congressional action after 1982, further confirm our understanding that § 2 does not encompass this claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>The Original VRA of 1965</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The original VRA was enacted against the background of explicit constitutional and congressional<sup>[11]</sup> approval of state felon disenfranchisement laws and expressed no intention to invalidate such laws, but rather an intention to leave such laws untouched.</p>\n<p>Prior to the enactment of the VRA, enforcement of the Fifteenth Amendment guarantee that the \"right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged ... on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude,\" U.S. Const. amend. XV, § 1, was unsatisfactory. <i>Nw. Austin,</i> 129 S.Ct. at *2508-09.</p>\n<p>In 1965, Congress enacted the VRA with the intent to \"banish the blight of racial discrimination in voting, which ha[d] infected the electoral process in parts of our country for nearly a century.\" <i>South Carolina v. Katzenbach,</i> 383 U.S. 301, 308, 86 S.Ct. 803, 15 L.Ed.2d 769 (1966). Plaintiffs' claim here concededly does not involve any such intent. The language of the original § 2 \"tracked ... the text of the Fifteenth Amendment,\" <i>Bartlett,</i> 129 S.Ct. at 1240. The Court emphasized this point when it said that the original § 2 did \"no more than elaborate[] upon ... the Fifteenth Amendment,\" <i>id.</i> at 1241 (omission in original) (quoting <i>City of Mobile v. Bolden,</i> 446 U.S. 55, 60-61, 100 S.Ct. 1490, 64 L.Ed.2d 47 (1980) (plurality opinion)) (internal quotation marks omitted). The VRA's original object was plainly to combat specific forms of racial discrimination.<sup>[12]</sup> Beyond § 2, the remainder of the VRA set up a scheme of stringent remedies to address the most flagrant practices. \"[T]he Act directly pre-empted the most powerful tools of black disenfranchisement in the covered areas. All literacy tests and similar voting qualifications were abolished by § 4 of the Act.\" <i>Nw. Austin,</i> 129 S.Ct. at *2509, (citing Voting Rights Act of 1965, §§ 4(a)-(d), 79 Stat. 437, 438-439).</p>\n<p>The legislative history of the VRA shows that Congress was not silent with respect to felon disenfranchisement laws. In fact, Congress explicitly considered the effect of the VRA on state felon disenfranchisement laws, and did so under § 4, rather than under § 2.<sup>[13]</sup> Section 4 of the VRA bans any \"test or device\" that impermissibly limits the franchise. 42 U.S.C. § 1973b(c). Congress, in enacting § 4(c) proscribed several categories of historically discriminatory tests or devices, including some literacy tests, educational achievement or knowledge tests, and good moral character qualifications. But Congress was careful to carve out from its proscription of tests for good moral character any and all state <span class=\"star-pagination\">*37</span> felon disenfranchisement laws. H.R.Rep. No. 89-439 (1965), <i>reprinted in</i> 1965 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2437, 2547-57. In excluding felon disenfranchisement laws from the scope of § 4, Congress took the view that it did not consider such laws to be a discriminatory voter qualification or a \"tool[] of black disenfranchisement.\" <i>Nw. Austin,</i> 129 S.Ct. at *2509.</p>\n<p>The Senate Judiciary Committee Report explicitly stated that this § 4 prohibition on tests and devices \"would not result in the proscription of the frequent requirement of States and political subdivisions that an applicant for voting or registration for voting be free of conviction of a felony or mental disability.\" S.Rep. No. 89-162 (1965), <i>reprinted in</i> 1965 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2508, 2562 (joint views of Senators Dodd, Hart, Long, Kennedy, Bayh, Burdick, Tydings, Dirksen, Hruska, Fong, Scott, and Javits).</p>\n<p>The House Report confirms the Senate's understanding. It stated that the VRA \"does not proscribe a requirement of a State or any political subdivision of a State that an applicant for voting or registration for voting be free of conviction of a felony or mental disability.\" H.R.Rep. No. 89-439, <i>reprinted in</i> 1965 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2457.</p>\n<p>In drafting the VRA, Congress considered felon disenfranchisement statutes, and it viewed them as a potential test or device that fell within the purview of § 4 and not § 2. We are not free to second guess Congress's categorizations of felon disenfranchisement statutes. Further, Congress made clear that it did not purport to outlaw state felon disenfranchisement statutes based on their effect. Rather, under § 4, Congress enumerated and outlawed tests or devices it viewed as disqualifications excluding minority voters. Felon disenfranchisement laws were specifically removed from this category by Congress and were considered nondiscriminatory.</p>\n<p>In light of this express history, Congress could not have intended to create a cause of action under § 2 of the VRA against disenfranchisement of incarcerated felons while saying explicitly elsewhere that it did not intend to proscribe any such laws. Other courts agree with our conclusion. <i>Hayden,</i> 449 F.3d at 319 (\"[I]t is apparent to us that Congress's effort to highlight the exclusion of felon disenfranchisement laws from a VRA provision that otherwise would likely be read to invalidate such laws is indicative of its broader intention to exclude such laws from the reach of the statute.\"); <i>see also </i><i>Farrakhan,</i> 359 F.3d at 1120-21 (Kozinski, J., dissenting from denial of reh'g en banc).</p>\n<p>This point is buttressed by another aspect of § 4. As drafted in 1965, § 4 applied to covered jurisdictions.<sup>[14]</sup> Congress would not have permitted felon disenfranchisement laws in covered jurisdictions where there was a history of discrimination, while prohibiting them in non-covered jurisdictions like Massachusetts. To subject felon disenfranchisement in a non-covered jurisdiction to a VRA cause of action while prohibiting such a cause of action for a covered jurisdiction would itself raise significant <span class=\"star-pagination\">*38</span> constitutional concerns. <i>See Nw. Austin,</i> 129 S.Ct. at *2513.</p>\n<p>If there were any doubt as to Congress's intent not to create a cause of action against laws like Article 120, other actions show congressional acceptance of even broader felon disenfranchisement laws than involved here, reinforcing the conclusion that § 2 was not meant to proscribe laws such as Article 120. In 1971, just six years after passing the VRA, Congress affirmatively enacted a broader felon disenfranchisement statute covering both imprisoned and paroled felons in the District of Columbia, over which it then exercised plenary power. Act of Dec. 23, 1971, Pub.L. No. 92-220, § 4, 85 Stat. 788, 788; <i>see also </i><i>Hayden,</i> 449 F.3d at 315. Congress would not have prohibited states from imposing such disqualifications when it imposed them itself on the District.</p>\n<p>Further, between the passage of the VRA in 1965 and the 1982 amendments, Congress considered and rejected proposals to amend the VRA<sup>[15]</sup> to prohibit certain types of state felon disenfranchisement laws. Congress understood that the VRA, as enacted in 1965, did not permit claims against state felon disenfranchisement laws and that amendment of the VRA would be needed to permit such suits, and it declined to make those amendments. Two points are important. First, Congress rejected each those proposed amendments. Second, even those rejected amendments would have precluded suits raising claims of disenfranchisement of a \"citizen [who] is confined in a correctional facility at the time of such ... election,\" as does Article 120 now at issue. <i>See Ex-Offenders Voting Rights: Hearing on H.R. 9020 Before the Subcomm. on Courts, Civil Liberties, and the Administration of Justice of the H. Comm. on the Judiciary,</i> 93d Cong. 4 (1974).</p>\n<p>In 1972, the House Judiciary Committee held hearings on \"The Problems of the Ex-Offender.\" <i>See Corrections, Part VI, Illinois: The Problems of the Ex-Offender: Hearing Before Subcomm. No. 3 of the H. Comm. on the Judiciary,</i> 92d Cong. (1972). In response to these hearings, several prominent VRA advocates in Congress jointly introduced a bill designed \"to amend the [VRA] to prohibit the States from denying the right to vote in Federal elections to <i>former</i> criminal offenders who have not been convicted of any offense related to voting or elections <i>and who are not confined in a correctional institution.</i>\" <i>Hayden,</i> 449 F.3d at 319 (emphasis added) (quoting H.R. 15,049, 92d Cong. (1972)) (internal quotation marks omitted). The bill did not result in legislation. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Similarly, Congress held hearings in 1973 expressly addressing but not adopting proposed amendments to the VRA to allow challenges to felon disenfranchisement for only that category of ex-offenders who were not imprisoned.<sup>[16]</sup><i>See Ex-Offenders Voting Rights: Hearing on H.R. 9020, supra,</i> 93d Cong. 1-38; <i>see also </i><i>Hayden,</i> 449 F.3d at 319.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*39</span> Plaintiffs' claim that § 2 as drafted in 1965 permits a cause of action against Article 120 fails.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>The 1982 Amendments</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We reject plaintiffs' position that § 2(b), added in 1982, may not be considered in analyzing whether they have a claim under § 2(a).<sup>[17]</sup> Furthermore, we conclude that those amendments, while altering the law as to vote dilution claims and perhaps as to other claims (which we need not decide), undercut plaintiffs' arguments that Congress intended the VRA to reach laws disenfranchising incarcerated felons.</p>\n<p>The 1982 amendments did not alter the prior understanding that the VRA did not reach the disenfranchisement of currently incarcerated felons. When \"Congress adopts a new law incorporating sections of a prior law, Congress normally can be presumed to have had knowledge of the [administrative or judicial] interpretation given to the incorporated law, at least insofar as it affects the new statute.\" <i>Lorillard v. Pons,</i> 434 U.S. 575, 581, 98 S.Ct. 866, 55 L.Ed.2d 40 (1978). Nothing in the text, context,<sup>[18]</sup> or history supports plaintiffs' position.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court held that \"Congress amended § 2 of the VRA to make clear that <i>certain</i> practices and procedures that result in the denial or abridgement of the right to vote are forbidden even though the absence of proof of discriminatory intent protects them from constitutional challenge.\" <i>Chisom,</i> 501 U.S. at 383-84, 111 S.Ct. 2354 (emphasis added); <i>Johnson,</i> 405 F.3d at 1228. Felon disqualification was not among those certain practices and procedures.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs admirably admit that Congress's specific purpose in amending § 2 of the VRA<sup>[19]</sup> was to overrule certain aspects <span class=\"star-pagination\">*40</span> of the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Bolden,</i> which was concerned with vote dilution claims, not direct denial claims. We explain. Prior to <i>Bolden,</i> in <i>White v. Regester,</i> 412 U.S. 755, 93 S.Ct. 2332, 37 L.Ed.2d 314 (1973), minority plaintiffs had successfully challenged a state districting plan on vote dilution grounds. There, the Court did not require a showing of discriminatory intent. <i>See id.</i> at 766. By contrast, the <i>Bolden</i> plurality held that state action \"that is racially neutral on its face violates the Fifteenth Amendment only if motivated by a discriminatory purpose,\" 446 U.S. at 61, 100 S.Ct. 1490, and altered the <i>White</i> evidentiary standard in vote dilution cases to require direct evidence of discriminatory intent.<sup>[20]</sup><i>See </i><i>Bartlett,</i> 129 S.Ct. at 1240-41.</p>\n<p>In 1982, Congress focused on reversing this aspect of <i>Bolden</i> and clarifying the standard for vote dilution claims. Congress aimed to reinstate the \"results test,\" which had been the rule developed in the pre-<i>Bolden</i> case law for vote dilution claims under <i>White. See </i><i>Metts,</i> 363 F.3d at 10 (stating the 1982 amendments made it clear that \"discriminatory intent is not a necessary element in a violation and that Congress [instead] intended a broad range of factors to be taken into account\"). But the reinstated, multifactored results test was not meant to extend to this limited felon disenfranchisement claim any more than the pre-<i>Bolden</i> tests were. Nothing in the legislative history of § 2(b) indicated any intent to expand the VRA to create a cause of action against a state felon disenfranchisement law such as Article 120. To the contrary, in enacting § 2, Congress noted that it was impossible to predict the variety of means that would be used to infringe on the right to vote and that the voting rights landscape was marked by innovation in discrimination. S.Rep. No. 89-162, at 5 (1965); S.Rep. No. 89-439, at 10. But these concerns do not go to felon disenfranchisement, which was neither a new innovation nor a predictable future innovation. Felon disenfranchisement was a well-known and accepted part of the voting landscape. \"The Senate Report, which details many discriminatory techniques used by certain jurisdictions, made no mention of felon disenfranchisement provisions.\" <i>Johnson,</i> 405 F.3d at 1234; <i>see also</i> Tokaji, <i>supra,</i> at 707 (\"The legislative history of the 1982 amendments thus shows that Congress was almost exclusively focused on vote dilution claims.\").<sup>[21]</sup></p>\n<p>Further, the language of § 2(b) undercuts plaintiffs' assertion they have stated a claim under § 2(a). The text of subsection (b) protects a \"class of citizens\" who by law may and should enjoy as full an \"opportunity [as] other members of the electorate to participate in the political process.\" § 1973(b). For a host of valid reasons, incarcerated prisoners cannot participate in the political process equally with free citizens outside the prison walls. <i>Hayden,</i> 449 F.3d at 342 (Jacobs, J., concurring). As noted by <i>Hayden,</i> \"There is no question that incarcerated persons cannot <span class=\"star-pagination\">*41</span> `fully participate in the political process'they cannot petition, protest, campaign, travel, freely associate, or raise funds.\" <i>Id.</i> at 321.</p>\n<p>Further, the 1982 Congress amended § 2 to assuage expressed fears that the courts would interpret a results test as a requirement for proportional representation in vote dilution cases, and therefore the statute was amended to expressly disclaim any right to proportional representation. § 1973(b) (\"[N]othing in this section establishes a right to have members of a protected class elected in numbers equal to their proportion in the population.\"); Tokaji, <i>supra,</i> at 705-06. This suggests that Congress was fundamentally concerned with remedying discrimination in voting, rather than guaranteeing proportionality in political representation. <i>See, e.g.,</i> S. Issacharoff, <i>Polarized Voting and the Political Process,</i> 90 Mich. L.Rev. 1833 (1992). Plaintiffs' claim, which is based on mere disproportionality in the prison population from felon disenfranchisement, does not implicate these concerns.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>Post-1982 Congressional Actions Assume the Validity of State and Federal Felon Disenfranchisement Laws</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Congressional action, both after 1982 and in the aftermath of <i>Bush v. Gore</i><i>,</i> also undercuts the plaintiffs' reading of the amended § 2 to support a claim against imprisoned felon disenfranchisement laws. These statutes show continuing congressional approval of state laws disenfranchising imprisoned felons. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993, which generally restricts states' ability to remove names from the voter rolls, explicitly exempts state decisions to disenfranchise individuals \"by reason of criminal conviction.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1973gg-6(a)(3)(B). The Help America Vote Act of 2002 directs states to remove disenfranchised felons from their lists of those eligible to vote in federal elections. 42 U.S.C. § 15483(a)(2)(A)(ii)(I). These two recent statutes are entirely inconsistent with reading § 2, whatever its breadth, to create a cause of action against Article 120.</p>\n<p>Further, Congress has continued to consider and reject numerous proposals to require states to enfranchise even former felons. Even these efforts have expressly excluded currently incarcerated felons. <i>See, e.g., Civic Participation and Rehabilitation Act of 1999: Hearing on H.R. 906 Before the Subcomm. on the Constitution of the H. Comm. on the Judiciary,</i> 106th Cong. 1, 3 (2000) (quoting H.R. 906, 106th Cong. (1999)).<sup>[22]</sup></p>\n<p>Congress has excepted from the reach of the VRA protections from vote denial for claims against a state which disenfranchises incarcerated felons. We do not need to decide<sup>[23]</sup> what is needed to prove a denial <span class=\"star-pagination\">*42</span> (as opposed to a dilution) claim under § 2 which is not a claim against a state provision disenfranchising imprisoned felons.<sup>[24]</sup></p>\n<p>Given the historic legitimacy of felon disenfranchisement, the constitutional recognition of the authority of states to disenfranchise imprisoned felons, the congressional recognition of that authority and the express congressional statements that the VRA was not meant to proscribe that authority, this is not the case in which to test the standards for other types of purported direct disenfranchisement claims. While our emphasis is somewhat different, we agree with the Second Circuit in <i>Hayden</i> that the seven circumstances it identifies all necessitate the conclusion that the this claim is not actionable. 449 F.3d at 315-16.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim under VRA § 2. We have no need to reach the serious constitutional questions which the Commonwealth argues would be raised were we to adopt plaintiffs' construction of the statute. In <i>Northwest Austin,</i> the Supreme Court emphasized the principle that courts, particularly in VRA cases, should avoid deciding constitutional issues where statutory interpretation obviates the issue, as here. <i>Nw. Austin,</i> 129 S.Ct. at *2508 (\"Our usual practice is to avoid the unnecessary resolution of constitutional questions.\"); <i>see also </i><i>Hayden,</i> 449 F.3d at 328 n. 24; <i>Johnson,</i> 405 F.3d at 1230.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>EX POST FACTO CLAUSE CLAIM</i></h2>\n<p>We turn to plaintiffs' appeal from the district court's grant of summary judgment <span class=\"star-pagination\">*43</span> in favor of the Commonwealth on the Ex Post Facto Clause arguments. There are no material facts in dispute in the record.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs argue the Ex Post Facto Clause was violated because \"the only plainly discernible purpose for Article 120 was to seek to impose an additional measure of punishment upon those who had violated the laws of the Commonwealth.\" Plaintiffs point to the a transcript of the debates at the 1998 and 2000 Constitutional Conventions over the bill that ultimately became Article 120. Plaintiffs also rely on language from Acting Governor Cellucci's proposed amendment and his statements to the public, an amendment which was not accepted. These statements include: \"The time has come to tell would-be criminals in Massachusetts that committing crimes has serious consequences,\" and that \"[p]risons are a place for punishment.\" Even though his initial proposal was never in fact acted on by the legislature, we consider his comments as part of the background.</p>\n<p>Analysis of the Ex Post Facto Clause claim involves a two-part inquiry. The first asks whether the denial of the right to vote is a civil, regulatory measure within the meaning of the caselaw, or whether it is punitive. \"[W]here unpleasant consequences are brought to bear upon an individual for prior conduct,\" the central question \"is whether the legislative aim was to punish that individual for past activity, or whether the restriction of the individual comes about as a relevant incident to a regulation of a present situation.\" <i>De Veau v. Braisted,</i> 363 U.S. 144, 160, 80 S.Ct. 1146, 4 L.Ed.2d 1109 (1960) (holding that state statutory bans against employment of convicted felons in certain jobs did not impose punishment under Ex Post Facto Clause). Only a punitive measure can violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Smith v. Doe,</i> 538 U.S. 84, 92, 123 S.Ct. 1140, 155 L.Ed.2d 164 (2003); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Salerno,</i> 481 U.S. 739, 107 S.Ct. 2095, 95 L.Ed.2d 697 (1987) (holding preventative detention under the Bail Reform Act was permissible because it was regulatory and preventative, rather than punitive).</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has stated that felon disenfranchisement provisions are considered regulatory rather than punitive. In <i>Trop v. Dulles,</i> 356 U.S. 86, 78 S.Ct. 590, 2 L.Ed.2d 630 (1958), the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote>[A] statute has been considered nonpenal if it imposes a disability, not to punish, but to accomplish some other legitimate governmental purpose.... The point may be illustrated by the situation of an ordinary felon. A person who commits a bank robbery, for instance, loses his right to liberty and often his right to vote. If, in the exercise of the power to protect banks, both sanctions were imposed for the purpose of punishing bank robbers, the statutes authorizing both disabilities would be penal. But because the purpose of the latter statute is to designate a reasonable ground of eligibility for voting, this law is sustained as a nonpenal exercise of the power to regulate the franchise.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 96-97, 78 S.Ct. 590; <i>see also </i><i>Lassiter v. Northampton County Bd. of Elections,</i> 360 U.S. 45, 51, 79 S.Ct. 985, 3 L.Ed.2d 1072 (1959) (criminal record is an \"obvious\" factor that \"a State may take into consideration in determining the qualifications of voters\"). Article 120 is no exception.</p>\n<p>Even if the Supreme Court had not already described such regulation of the franchise with respect to incarcerated felons as nonpenal, we would still find Article 120 to be a civil regulatory scheme. In examining Article 120 \"on its face,\" <i>Hudson v. United States,</i> 522 U.S. 93, 100, 118 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*44</span> S.Ct. 488, 139 L.Ed.2d 450 (1997), there is no language indicating the Commonwealth's provision is penal. Article 120 is not in the Commonwealth's criminal code, but rather its civil constitutional and statutory voter qualification provisions. <i>See </i><i>Hendricks,</i> 521 U.S. at 361, 117 S.Ct. 2072, (\"[The State's] objective to create a civil proceeding is evidenced by its placement of the Act within the [State's] probate code, instead of the criminal code\" (citations omitted)). Article 120 also disenfranchises persons under guardianship, persons disqualified because of corrupt elections practices, and all persons under eighteen years of age, as well as incarcerated felons. And the disqualification is enforced civilly, not criminally.</p>\n<p>Article 120 does not involve a more general period of disenfranchisement because of commission of a felony; rather Article 120 is limited to the period of incarceration. Article 120 thus creates a temporary qualification on the right to vote coincident with imprisonment, rather than a long-term consequence for the commission of a crime.</p>\n<p>Article 120 is a constitutional amendment, which was later effectuated and extended by statute. The voters of Massachusetts ratified Article 120 in a statewide election. The Voter Guide read by the voters, which we described earlier, made no mention of any goal of punishing prisoners. \"The Ex Post Facto Clause does not preclude a State from making reasonable categorical judgments that conviction of specified crimes should entail particular regulatory consequences.\" <i>Smith,</i> 123 S.Ct. at 1153.</p>\n<p>Secondly, even if the legislature intended to deem a particular law \"civil,\" courts must further inquire whether \"the statutory scheme was so punitive either in purpose or effect as to negate that intention.\" <i>United States v. Ward,</i> 448 U.S. 242, 248-49, 100 S.Ct. 2636, 65 L.Ed.2d 742 (1980). \"`[O]nly the clearest proof' will suffice to override legislative intent and transform what has been denominated a civil remedy into a criminal penalty.\" <i>Hudson,</i> 522 U.S. at 100, 118 S.Ct. 488 (quoting <i>Ward,</i> 448 U.S. at 249, 100 S.Ct. 2636). Plaintiffs fail to meet this standard.</p>\n<p>We review whether plaintiffs' allegations of punitive purpose meet the non-exclusive factors test set forth in <i>Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez,</i> 372 U.S. 144, 168-69, 83 S.Ct. 554, 9 L.Ed.2d 644 (1963), and followed in <i>Smith,</i> 538 U.S. at 97, 123 S.Ct. 1140.</p>\n<p>The <i>Mendoza-Martinez</i> factors are: (1) whether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint; (2) whether it has historically been regarded as punishment; (3) whether it comes into play only on a finding of scienter; (4) whether its operation will promote the traditional aims of punishmentretribution and deterrence; (5) whether the behavior to which it applies is already a crime; (6) whether there is a rational connection to a nonpunitive purpose; and (7) whether it appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned. <i>Mendoza-Martinez,</i> 372 U.S. at 168-69, 83 S.Ct. 554. The most relevant factors are whether felon disenfranchisement \"has been regarded in our history and traditions as a punishment; imposes an affirmative disability or restraint; promotes the traditional aims of punishment; has a rational connection to a nonpunitive purpose; or is excessive with respect to this purpose.\" <i>Smith,</i> 538 U.S. at 97, 123 S.Ct. 1140.</p>\n<p>First, Article 120 does not impose any affirmative disability or restraint, physical or otherwise. <i>See </i><i>Smith,</i> 538 U.S. at 100, 123 S.Ct. 1140 (\"[I]mprisonment... is the paradigmatic affirmative disability or restraint.\"). Disenfranchisement <span class=\"star-pagination\">*45</span> during the period of incarceration imposes no additional term of imprisonment, <i>see </i><i>Flemming v. Nestor,</i> 363 U.S. 603, 617, 80 S.Ct. 1367, 4 L.Ed.2d 1435 (1960), and is not as enduring as permanent occupational debarment, which the Court has held is nonpunitive. <i>Hudson,</i> 522 U.S. at 104, 118 S.Ct. 488; <i>De Veau,</i> 363 U.S. at 144, 80 S.Ct. 1146; <i>Hawker v. New York,</i> 170 U.S. 189, 18 S.Ct. 573, 42 L.Ed. 1002 (1898) (revocation of a medical license does not violate Ex Post Facto clause).</p>\n<p>Second, felon disenfranchisement has historically not been regarded as punitive in the United States, as the Supreme Court indicated in <i>Trop v. Dulles</i><i>.</i> Indeed, in holding that felon disenfranchisement has \"affirmative sanction\" in § 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, <i>Richardson,</i> 418 U.S. at 54, 94 S.Ct. 2655, the Supreme Court noted the historical <i>prevalence</i> of state felon disenfranchisement laws and never characterized even California's broad disqualification of former felons as punitive. <i>Id.</i> at 55, 94 S.Ct. 2655.</p>\n<p>As to the third and fifth factors, Article 120 is effective regardless of a finding of scienter or the type of crime so long as it is a felony. That Article 120 may be \"tied to criminal activity\" is \"insufficient to render the statut[e] punitive.\" <i>United States v. Ursery,</i> 518 U.S. 267, 291, 116 S.Ct. 2135, 135 L.Ed.2d 549 (1996).</p>\n<p>The fourth <i>Mendoza-Martinez</i> factor considers whether felon disenfranchisement will promote the traditional aims of punishment, retribution and deterrence, to see whether plaintiffs have offered the clearest proof to overcome the statement of nonpenal purpose. Plaintiffs rely on some statements made by some legislators that could be viewed as retributive, such as that felons \"don't deserve to vote.\" To the extent the legislators' comments are relevant, they are sporadic and do not clearly evince a retributive purpose. More significantly, since Article 120 was put before the voters, the Information for Voters Guide is a better source of context. The Guide contained a balanced debate about the merits of allowing currently incarcerated felons to vote in state elections, noted the problem of prisoners being able to affect the laws under which they were confined by voting, and nowhere suggests an intent to punish prisoners.</p>\n<p>As to the sixth factor, there is an obvious rational nonpunitive purpose for disenfranchisement: as the Guide shows, voters were concerned about the influence of currently incarcerated felons in \"exercis[ing] control over [their] lives by voting from prison.\" <i>See also </i><i>Smith,</i> 123 S.Ct. at 1147 (noting that \"even if the objective of the Act is consistent with the purposes of the [state] criminal justice system, the State's pursuit of it in a regulatory scheme does not make the objective punitive.\"). Finally, Article 120 is not excessive in accomplishing this purpose. Article 120 does not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>The entry of judgment against the plaintiffs' Ex Post Facto Clause claim is affirmed; the court's denial of the motion to dismiss the VRA claim is reversed and the case is remanded to the district court for dismissal of both claims with prejudice. Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<p>TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge (Dissenting).</p>\n<p>Lest we be misled by the majority's choice of emphasis, this is <i>not</i> a case about the state's authority to disenfranchise convicted felons, nor about the popularity or desirability of that practice. Were that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*46</span> the issue before us, I too would be in the majority, as the validity of felon disenfranchisement laws, as a general matter, has been established. <i>See </i><i>Richardson v. Ramirez,</i> 418 U.S. 24, 56, 94 S.Ct. 2655, 41 L.Ed.2d 551 (1974). Moreover, were that the issue before us, it would not have spawned reams of conflicting opinions, vigorous dissents and en banc reversals among our sister circuits.<sup>[25]</sup></p>\n<p>Rather this is a case about interpreting a clearly worded congressional statute, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (\"VRA\"), according to its terms, when there is no persuasive reason to do otherwise. <i>Nw. Austin Mun. Util. Dist. No. One v. Holder,</i> 557 U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 2504, 2513, 174 L.Ed.2d 140 (2009) (\"The Fifteenth Amendment empowers `Congress,' not the [c]ourt[s], to determine in the first instance what legislation is needed to enforce it.\"). It is also a case about the constitutional validity of altering the legal consequences for committing a crime, long after the crime's completion. Because I disagree with the majority's resolution of both of these novel issues, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Voting Rights Act Claim</h2>\n<p>Section 2 of the VRA, as amended in 1982, plainly provides that \"<i>[n]o voting qualification</i> or prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or applied by any State ... in a manner which <i>results</i> in a denial or abridgement of the right ... to vote on account of race or color....\" 42 U.S.C. § 1973(2)(a) (emphasis added); <i>see also </i><i>Nw. Austin,</i> 557 U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 2504, 2508. Notably, § 2(a) employs a \"`results'\" test, under which proof of discriminatory intent is not necessary to establish a violation of the section. <i>Chisom v. Roemer,</i> 501 U.S. 380, 395, 111 S.Ct. 2354, 115 L.Ed.2d 348 (1991). Rather, plaintiffs can state a § 2 claim by showing that under the \"totality of circumstances,\" a \"certain electoral law, practice, or structure interacts with social and historical conditions to cause an inequality in the opportunities enjoyed by black and white voters to elect their preferred representatives.\" <i>Thornburg v. Gingles,</i> 478 U.S. 30, 43-44, 106 S.Ct. 2752, 92 L.Ed.2d 25 (1986).<sup>[26]</sup> The allegations in plaintiffs' complaint, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*47</span> which we must accept as true at this preliminary stage, <i>see </i><i>Pérez-Acevedo v. Rivero-Cubano,</i> 520 F.3d 26, 29 (1st Cir.2008), are that Massachusetts' Article 120, which disqualifies incarcerated felons from voting in the Commonwealth, has a disproportionately adverse effect on the voting rights of African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans, who are over-represented in the incarcerated felon population. Plaintiffs allege that this disparate impact is caused, in part, by racial and ethnic bias in the Massachusetts court system, and operates to deny these racial minorities the right to vote, in violation of § 2 of the VRA. Plaintiffs further allege that when enacting Article 120, Massachusetts legislators were aware of the data regarding racial bias in the criminal justice system.<sup>[27]</sup></p>\n<p>The felon disenfranchisement provision at issue is clearly a \"voting qualification.\" Whether or not this provision results in the denial of the right to vote \"on account of race or color\" under the \"totality of the circumstances\" remains the ultimate question for the trier of fact. But \"[e]ven if serious problems lie ahead in applying the `totality' of the circumstances standard described in [VRA] § 2(b), that task, difficult as it may prove to be, cannot justify a judicially created limitation on the coverage of the broadly worded statute, as enacted and amended by Congress.\" <i>Chisom,</i> 501 U.S. at 403, 111 S.Ct. 2354. Plaintiffs have stated a claim sufficient to preclude dismissal at this preliminary stage and are entitled to the opportunity to develop it.</p>\n<p>In order to avoid this obvious result, the majority makes an expansive and unwarranted holding. It holds that despite the broad language of VRA § 2, covering all \"voting qualifications,\" Congress actually never intended for felon disenfranchisement laws, even discriminatory ones, to be challengeable under that provision. It does so by disregarding the plain and unambiguous text of the statute and resorting to a collection of secondary evidence, none of which stand for the proposition the majority seeks to establish. In the face of so startling a holding, I am left wondering, in the words of Judge Calabresi, \"[w]hat is behind this remarkable decision to buck text, context, and legislative history in order to insulate a particular racially discriminatory practice from an anti-discrimination rule of general applicability?\" <i>Hayden,</i> 449 F.3d at 365 (Calabresi, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>The fatal flaw in the majority's reasoning begins with its improper reliance on legislative history given the plain and unambiguous language of § 2(a), the section of the VRA governing the central \"applicability\" question before us. <i>See </i><i>Robinson</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*48</span> <i>v. Shell Oil Co.,</i> 519 U.S. 337, 340, 117 S.Ct. 843, 136 L.Ed.2d 808 (1997) (\"Our first step in interpreting a statute is to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning <i>with regard to the particular dispute in the case.</i>\" (emphasis added)). The plain language of § 2(a) unambiguously applies to <i>all</i> \"voting qualifications.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1973. A provision disqualifying incarcerated felons, listed among the provisions of the Massachusetts Constitution governing qualifications to vote, clearly constitutes a \"voting qualification.\" Therefore, where it is alleged, as here, that this \"qualification\" is being applied \"in a manner which results\" in the denial of the right to vote on account of race, a cognizable VRA claim has been stated. <i>Id.</i> As the text of the statute unambiguously manifests its meaning, there was no need to go any further in order to conclude that plaintiffs have stated a cognizable claim under § 2 of the VRA.</p>\n<p>This is the reasoning upon which the Ninth Circuit decision, holding that an identical VRA claim had been stated in that Circuit, starts and ends. <i>See </i><i>Farrakhan,</i> 338 F.3d at 1016 (\"Plaintiff's claim of vote denial [resulting from Washington's felon disenfranchisement law] is cognizable under Section 2 of the VRA because `[f]elon disenfranchisement' is a voting qualification, and Section 2 is clear that <i>any</i> voting qualification that denies citizens the right to vote in a discriminatory manner violates the VRA\" (emphasis added)).<sup>[28]</sup> As Judge Sotomayor similarly explained in her powerful dissenting opinion in <i>Hayden:</i></p>\n<blockquote>It is plain to anyone reading the Voting Rights Act that it applies to all `voting qualifications.' And it is equally plain that [the felon disenfranchisement provision at issue] disqualifies a group of people from voting. These two propositions should constitute the entirety of our analysis.</blockquote>\n<p>449 F.3d at 367-68; <i>see also </i><i>Johnson,</i> 405 F.3d at 1247 (Barkett, J., dissenting) (\"[Plaintiffs'] contention that Florida's felon disenfranchisement law effectively denies their right to vote because they are black is clearly encompassed by the plain language of the VRA.\").</p>\n<p>The majority cannot dispute \"the traditional rule that where the plain text of the statute is unmistakably clear on its face, there is no need to discuss legislative history.\" <i>Succar v. Ashcroft,</i> 394 F.3d 8, 31 (1st Cir.2005) (Lynch, J.) (quoting <i>Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc.,</i> 527 U.S. 471, 481, 119 S.Ct. 2139, 144 L.Ed.2d 450 (1999)). While the majority cites <i>Nken v. Holder,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 1749, 173 L.Ed.2d 550 (2009) for the general proposition that statutory interpretations turns on language as well as context, <i>id.</i> at 1756, neither <i>Nken</i> nor the case upon which it relies addressed a statute whose plain meaning is as evident and clear on its face as the one before us. In fact, contrary to the majority's contention, even with complicated statutory schemes like the VRA, courts have not hesitated to rely on the plain language of the text, where the text plainly answers the very question before them. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Lopez v. Monterey County,</i> 525 U.S. 266, 278-79, 119 S.Ct. 693, 142 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*49</span> L.Ed.2d 728 (1999); <i>Chisom,</i> 501 U.S. at 396, 111 S.Ct. 2354. There is simply no support in our precedent for disregarding so plain and unambiguous a statutory mandate based on nothing more than our own assumption that Congress did not mean what it said. <i>See BedRoc Ltd., LLC,</i> 541 U.S. at 183, 124 S.Ct. 1587 (explaining that absent ambiguity we are bound by the \"preeminent canon of statutory interpretation [that] requires us to presume that [the] legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); <i>United States v. Shreveport Grain &amp; Elevator Co.,</i> 287 U.S. 77, 83, 53 S.Ct. 42, 77 L.Ed. 175 (1932) (quoting <i>Hamilton v. Rathbone,</i> 175 U.S. 414, 421, 20 S.Ct. 155, 44 L.Ed. 219 (1899) for proposition that legislative history may be resorted to in order \"to <i>solve,</i> but not to <i>create,</i> an ambiguity\" (emphasis added)); <i>Ruiz v. Bally Total Fitness Holding Corp.,</i> 496 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.2007) (explaining that we \"are not free to disregard the plain language of a statute and, instead, conjure up legislative purposes and intent out of thin air\").</p>\n<p>Though it is unable to point to any actual textual ambiguity, the majority nevertheless makes a conclusory assertion that \"[t]he language of § 2(a) is both broad and ambiguous.\" Breadth, however, does not render a statute ambiguous. <i>See </i><i>BedRoc Ltd., LLC v. United States,</i> 541 U.S. 176, 187 n. 8, 124 S.Ct. 1587, 158 L.Ed.2d 338 (2004) (\"Where a law is plain and unambiguous, <i>whether it be expressed in general or limited terms,</i> the legislature should be intended to mean what they have plainly expressed, and consequently no room is left for construction.\" (emphasis added &amp; citation omitted)); <i>Diamond v. Chakrabarty,</i> 447 U.S. 303, 315, 100 S.Ct. 2204, 65 L.Ed.2d 144 (1980) (\"Broad general language is not necessarily ambiguous when congressional objectives require broad terms.\"). Rather, \"a statute is ambiguous only if it admits of more than one reasonable interpretation.\" <i>United States v. Vidal-Reyes,</i> 562 F.3d 43, 51 (1st Cir.2009) (quoting <i>United States v. Godin,</i> 534 F.3d 51, 56 (1st Cir. 2008)). But \"[c]onspicuously absent from the majority opinion is so much as a hint of an intelligible reading under which [the felon disenfranchisement provision] is not a `voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard, practice or procedure.' (What else on earth could [the provision] possibly be?)\". <i>Hayden,</i> 449 F.3d at 346 (Parker, J., dissenting). There is simply no reasonable interpretation of § 2 under which a felon disenfranchisement law would not be a \"voting qualification or prerequisite to voting\" actionable thereunder.<sup>[29]</sup></p>\n<p>Given the clarity of the VRA language, which plainly encompasses the claim before us, the majority's resort to secondary sources to justify its contrary result constitutes a \"radical abandonment of our longstanding precedents that permit resort to legislative history only when necessary to interpret ambiguous statutory text.\" <i>Id.</i> at 187 n. 8, 124 S.Ct. 1587. I cannot endorse this impermissible practice. But even if, for the sake of argument, I take up the majority's invitation to investigate history and context, I find that <i>none</i> of the evidence cited by the majority indicates <span class=\"star-pagination\">*50</span> congressional intent to exclude felon disenfranchisement laws from § 2's purview so as to justify departing from the plain language of that provision. In fact, my reading of the legislative history is that it <i>confirms</i> the plain meaning of the text.</p>\n<p>One need not delve too deeply into the legislative history to discover that Congress enacted the Voting Rights Act of 1965 pursuant to its powers to enforce the Fifteenth Amendment for the \"broad remedial purpose of `rid[ding] the country of racial discrimination in voting.'\" <i>Chisom,</i> 501 U.S. at 403, 111 S.Ct. 2354 (quoting <i>South Carolina v. Katzenbach,</i> 383 U.S. 301, 315, 86 S.Ct. 803, 15 L.Ed.2d 769 (1966)); <i>see also </i><i>Nw. Austin,</i> 557 U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 2504, 2508-09.<sup>[30]</sup> At that time, although the Fifteenth Amendment guaranteeing the right to vote without regard to race or color had been in effect for nearly a hundred years, and thus, intentional discrimination was already prohibited, states continued to devise facially \"neutral\" devices such as gerrymandering, poll taxes, literacy tests and grandfather clauses, which, coupled with violence and intimidation, served to effectively bar minorities from access to the polls and preclude the Fifteenth Amendment's promise of racial equality in voting from becoming a reality. <i>See </i><i>Nw. Austin,</i> 557 U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 2504, 2508-09 (describing \"the first century of congressional enforcement of the [Fifteenth] Amendment\" as a \"failure\" and noting the \"creativ[ity] [of states] in `contriving new rules' to continue violating the Fifteenth Amendment\" (quoting <i>Katzenbach,</i> 383 U.S. at 335, 86 S.Ct. 803)); Andrew L. Shapiro, Note, <i>Challenging Criminal Disenfranchisement Under the Voting Rights Act: A New Strategy,</i> 103 Yale L.J. 537, 543 (1993). Accordingly, the text of the original § 2 \"tracked, in part, the text of the Fifteenth Amendment.\" <i>Bartlett v. Strickland,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 1231, 1240, 173 L.Ed.2d 173 (2009). While the legislative history of § 2 of the VRA is silent on the particular question of felon disenfranchisement, that history <i>does</i> clearly indicate that Congress intentionally kept § 2(a) as broad as possible because it found it \"impossible to predict the variety of means that would be used to infringe on the right to vote\" and wanted to encompass all such measures that states could devise. <i>Johnson,</i> 405 F.3d at 1243 (Wilson, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); <i>see also </i><i>Katzenbach,</i> 383 U.S. at 335, 86 S.Ct. 803 (noting that \"Congress knew that some of the States ... had resorted to the extraordinary stratagem of contriving new rules of various kinds for the sole purpose of perpetuating voting discrimination in the face of adverse federal court decrees\" and that \"Congress had reason to suppose that these States might try similar maneuvers in the future\"); H.R. Rep. 89-439, at 10 (1965), <i>reprinted in</i> 1965 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2437 (1965) (describing how, \"even after defeat resisters s[ought] new ways and means of discriminating,\" and, as a result, rejected the case by case approach that \"too often ha[d] caused no change in result, only in methods.\"). Thus, Congress intentionally chose the expansive language \"voting qualifications or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure\" for § 2 so as to be \"all-inclusive of any kind of practice\" that might be used by states to deny citizens that right. <i>Allen v. State Bd. of Elections,</i> 393 U.S. 544, 566-67, 89 S.Ct. 817, 22 L.Ed.2d 1 (1969) (citing testimony from Senate Judiciary <span class=\"star-pagination\">*51</span> Committee Hearings on the VRA).<sup>[31]</sup> As the Supreme Court has held, Congress intended the term \"voting qualification\" in § 2 to have the \"broadest possible scope\" and to reach \"any state enactment which altered the election of a covered State in even a minor way.\" <i>Id.,</i> 393 U.S. at 566-67, 89 S.Ct. 817.<sup>[32]</sup></p>\n<p>\"Criminal disenfranchisement is an outright barrier to voting that, like the poll tax and literacy test, was adopted in some states with racially discriminatory intent and has operated throughout our nation with racially discriminatory results.\" Shapiro, <i>supra,</i> at 543.<sup>[33]</sup> Thus, these laws were precisely the type of potentially discriminatory qualification that Congress intended to subject to scrutiny under the VRA. Yet the majority definitively concludes that the VRA of 1965 was not meant to allow such an action against <i>any</i> felon disenfranchisement law.</p>\n<p>The majority makes much of the fact that felon disenfranchisement was not specifically mentioned in the legislative history, but \"it would be a strange canon of statutory construction that would require Congress to state in committee reports or elsewhere in its deliberations that which is obvious on the face of a statute.\" <i>Harrison v. PPG Industries, Inc.,</i> 446 U.S. 578, 592, 100 S.Ct. 1889, 64 L.Ed.2d 525 (1980). It is also illogical to interpret silence as intent to exclude, given that the very purpose of § 2's broad language was to avoid reciting the various maneuvers that states <span class=\"star-pagination\">*52</span> may devise in the course of their \"unremitting and ingenious defiance.\" <i>Katzenbach,</i> 383 U.S. at 309, 86 S.Ct. 803. Rather, the VRA subjects <i>all</i> voting qualifications to scrutiny. In any event, if I were to read anything into that silence, I would reach the <i>opposite</i> conclusion. This is because felon disenfranchisement laws, which were undoubtedly among the mechanisms being employed by states throughout the post-reconstruction era to deprive minorities of the vote,<sup>[34]</sup> were inevitably within Congress's contemplation when drafting the VRA. Had Congress had intended to exclude this particular type of qualification from the reach of the statute, it could have done so explicitly. But Congress made no provisos to carve felon disenfranchisement laws out from the purposely \"all inclusive\" language of § 2(a). <i>See </i><i>Allen,</i> 393 U.S. at 566, 89 S.Ct. 817. In this historical context, congressional silence suggests, if anything, that no such exclusion was intended.</p>\n<p>Moreover, through the 1982 amendments to the VRA, Congress expanded the remedial power of the Act even further by relieving plaintiffs of the burden of proving discriminatory intent. Overturning a Supreme Court case that held that the original Act contained such a requirement, <i>see </i><i>Mobile v. Bolden,</i> 446 U.S. 55, 61, 100 S.Ct. 1490, 64 L.Ed.2d 47 (1980), Congress, through the 1982 amendments, made clear that a violation of § 2 could be established by proof of discriminatory <i>results. See </i><i>Thornburg,</i> 478 U.S. at 43-44, 106 S.Ct. 2752 (emphasis added) (reading the 1982 Amendment to the VRA as effectively overturning the <i>Bolden</i> requirement of showing purposeful discrimination); S.Rep. No. 97-417, at 27-28, 36-37 (1982), <i>as reprinted in</i> 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 177, 204-06, 214-15 (noting that the purpose of the Amendments was to repeal <i>Bolden</i> and to focus the judicial inquiry only into whether there exists equal access to electoral opportunity). Congress did so because it recognized the difficulty of proving deliberate and purposeful discrimination, and sought to ensure that \"in the context of all the circumstances in the jurisdiction in question,\" any disparate racial impact of facially neutral voting requirements did not result from racial discrimination. S.Rep. No. 97-417 at 27. This \"results test\" was intended \"to serve as a prophylactic against voting practicessuch as felon disenfranchisement ... adopted or retained due to intentional discrimination that would be difficult to prove in court.\" Daniel P. Tokaji, <i>The New Vote Denial: Where Election Reform Meets the Voting Rights Act,</i> 57 S.C. L.Rev. 689, 722 (2006). And its Report accompanying the enactment of the 1982 amendments, the Senate endorsed statements made by the Attorney General during the original VRA hearings that the purpose of \"Section 2 w[as][to] ban `<i>any kind of practice</i> ...' if its purpose or effect was to deny or abridge the right to vote on account of race or color.\" S.Rep. No. 97-417, at 17 (emphasis added). Given this history, it would be wholly incongruous with Congress's broad ameliorative intent to conclude, as does the majority, that where the particular voter qualification that results in racial discrimination happens to be a felon disenfranchisement law, in this eventuality only, does the VRA provide no relief and permit the discriminatory qualification to persist.</p>\n<p>To reach this unlikely result, the majority relies on assorted evidence of the widespread use and general sanction of felon disenfranchisement laws in various contexts. But all that any of this evidence actually shows is that felon disenfranchisement is not presumptively invalid, a proposition <span class=\"star-pagination\">*53</span> as to which, after <i>Richardson,</i> 418 U.S. at 56, 94 S.Ct. 2655, there is no doubt. None of the majority's arguments support its conclusion that Congress intended to insulate such laws from scrutiny under § 2 of the VRA where they are alleged to effect a discriminatory result. Specifically, the evidence relied on by the majority includes (1) § 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment, (2) the legislative history of VRA § 4, and (3) Congressional endorsement of felon disenfranchisement generally. I will address each of these sources in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment</h2>\n<p>The majority suggests that felon disenfranchisement somehow differs from other voting qualifications because the \"power of the states to disqualify from voting those convicted of crimes is explicitly set forth in § 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" But, looking at the text of that provision in context, it is by no means a grant of power to states to disenfranchise felons. <i>See</i> U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 2. Rather, that provision simply states that disenfranchised felons, unlike other persons disenfranchised by the States, are to be included within the census for purposes of apportioning representatives.<sup>[35]</sup></p>\n<p>The most that can be gleaned from this language is that by addressing the eventuality of \"abridg[ment] ... for participation in ... crime,\" Congress contemplated that at least in <i>some</i> circumstances, felon disenfranchisement could exist. Thus, it merely implies that there is no <i>per se</i> ban on such laws. But VRA § 2 is targeted at precisely those voting qualifications that are <i>not</i> the subject of a per se ban. <i>See</i> S.Rep. No. 97-417, at 16 (explaining that under § 2 as amended in 1982, \"electoral devices... per se would not be subject to attack under section 2. They would only be vulnerable, if, in the totality of circumstances, they resulted in the denial of equal access to the electoral process\"). As plaintiffs do not allege that felon disenfranchisement laws are unlawful per se, but only as applied in Massachusetts, where they \"result in a denial ... of the right ... to vote on account of race,\" 42 U.S.C. § 1973, there is absolutely no conflict between § 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment and allowing plaintiffs to challenge disenfranchisement laws under the VRA.</p>\n<p>In other words, that § 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment contemplates disenfranchisement as a potential qualification is unremarkable. As similarly emphasized by the majority, \"[t]he criteria for eligibility to vote are defined by the states,\" and states have the power to fix all kinds of qualifications for voting, disqualifying felons included, but only where the exercise of that power \"do[es] not contravene any restriction that Congress, acting pursuant to its constitutional powers, has imposed.\" <i>Lassiter v. Northampton County Bd. Of Elections,</i> 360 U.S. 45, 50, 79 S.Ct. 985, 3 L.Ed.2d 1072 (1959).<sup>[36]</sup> However, \"[w]hile <span class=\"star-pagination\">*54</span> a State may choose to disenfranchise some, all or none of its felons based on legitimate concerns, it may not do so based upon distinctions that have the effect, whether intentional or not, of disenfranchising felons because of their race.\" <i>Hayden,</i> 449 F.3d at 346 (Parker, J., dissenting) (quoting <i>Baker,</i> 85 F.3d at 937); <i>see also </i><i>Farrakhan,</i> 338 F.3d at 1016 (noting that although, as a general matter, \"states may deprive felons of the right to vote without violating the Fourteenth Amendment, ... when felon disenfranchisement results in denial of the right to vote ... on account of race or color, Section 2 affords disenfranchised felons the means to seek redress\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Legislative History of VRA § 4</h2>\n<p>To support its contention that Congress did not intend to include felon disenfranchisement laws within the scope of VRA <i>§ 2,</i> the majority also relies on statements in the legislative history of <i>§ 4,</i> claiming that <i>§ 4</i> \"would not result in the proscription of the frequent requirement of States... that an applicant for voting ... be free of conviction of a felony.\" S.Rep. No. 89-162 (1965), <i>as reprinted in</i> 1965 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2508, 2562. This argument is deeply flawed. It is error to assume that a statement about one section of a statute applies to all other sections thereof. <i>See </i><i>Hayden,</i> 449 F.3d at 352-53 (Parker, J., dissenting) (stating that legislative history of one section of an expansive statute such as VRA is \"typically of no value\" when attempting to understand another, entirely different, section). In fact, the Supreme Court has explicitly warned against doing so in the VRA context. <i>Hall,</i> 512 U.S. at 883, 114 S.Ct. 2581 (\"To be sure, if the structure and purpose of § 2 mirrored that of § 5, then the case for interpreting §§ 2 and 5 to have the same application in all cases would be convincing. But the two sections differ in structure, purpose, and application.\"). This is especially true in the case before us given that the two provisions, § 2 and § 4, \"differ in structure, purpose, and application.\" <i>Id.</i> Specifically, § 4 is a provision that <i>categorically</i> bans, in covered jurisdictions, the use of certain facially neutral tests or devices including literacy tests, educational requirements, and \"any requirement that a person as a prerequisite for voting or registration for voting ... possess good moral character.\" <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. § 1973b(a)(1)(A), § 1973b(c). In contrast, § 2 applies to \"a broader range of practices than those `tests and devices' defined in Section 4.\" <i>Johnson,</i> 353 F.3d at 1306 n. 27. While § 4 applies only to \"covered jurisdictions,\" and \"imposes an outright ban on tests or devices,\" \"§ 2(a), [applies nationally, and] creates a `results' test, which requires investigating and weighing numerous factors.\" <i>Hayden,</i> 449 F.3d at 353 (Parker, J., dissenting) (internal citation omitted); <i>see also </i><i>Nw. Austin,</i> 557 U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 2504, 2508 (distinguishing § 2 of the VRA, which \"operates <i>nationwide</i> ... [to] forbid[ ] <i>any</i> `standard practice or procedure' that `results in a denial or the abridgment of the right of any citizen ... to vote on account of race or color'\" from § 4 and the remainder of the VRA which, \"[r]ather than continuing to depend on case-by-case litigation ... <span class=\"star-pagination\">*55</span> directly pre-empted the most powerful tools of black disenfranchisement in the <i>covered areas.</i>\" (emphasis added &amp; internal citations omitted)).</p>\n<p>Thus, considering congressional statements about § 4 in the context of the provision at which they were addressed (§ 4), they signify nothing about the scope of what <i>§ 2</i> was intended to cover. Given § 4's absolute bar on \"good moral character\" tests, and the natural susceptibility of \"moral character\" being read as a proxy for criminal history, the statements upon which the majority relies merely clarify that the categorical bar on \"good moral character\" tests in § 4 should not be interpreted as also an outright ban on felon disenfranchisement. <i>See </i><i>Hayden,</i> 449 F.3d at 364-65 (Calabresi, J., dissenting) (\"[S]uch legislative statements simply make the uncontroversial point that felon disenfranchisement laws are not `good moral character' requirements within the meaning of § 4(c).\"). In contrast, \"section 2 addresses voting regulations that are not per se invalid under section 4 but nonetheless result in a racially disparate impact on voting rights.\" Thomas G. Varnum, <i>Let's Not Jump to Conclusions: Approaching Felon Disenfranchisement Challenges Under the Voting Rights Act,</i> 14 Mich. J. Race &amp; L. 109, 136 (2008). Statements regarding § 4 thus provide no indication that Congress intended to insulate felon disenfranchisement laws from scrutiny under § 2 where it is alleged that the operation of a particular law results in the denial of the right to vote on account of race. <i>See </i><i>Johnson,</i> 405 F.3d at 1249 (Barkett, J., dissenting) (noting that decision not to add felon disenfranchisement statutes to list of per se violations does not show intent to exempt these laws from the VRA); <i>Hayden,</i> 449 F.3d at 365 (Calabresi, J., dissenting) (\"The fact that race-neutral felon disenfranchisement is permissible under § 4(c) tells us nothing at all about whether § 2 allows <i>racially discriminatory</i> felon disenfranchisement.\" (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p>In support of its argument for applying § 4's legislative history to § 2, the majority suggests that, in light of § 4's limited applicability to \"covered jurisdictions\" with a history of discrimination, in contrast to § 2's nationwide reach, Congress could not have \"permitted\" felon disenfranchisement laws in covered jurisdictions, while \"prohibiting\" them in non-covered jurisdictions like Massachusetts. But this argument similarly misses the mark, precisely because it mischaracterizes the statute. To be sure, the majority's argument would be persuasive if § 2 categorically \"prohibit[ted]\" felon disenfranchisement laws in Massachusetts and other \"non-covered\" jurisdictions. But it does not. <i>See</i> S.Rep. No. 97-417, at 16. Nor does the VRA \"permit\" felon disenfranchisement laws, in \"covered jurisdictions,\" or otherwise. Rather, § 2 uniformly imposes a \"totality of the circumstances\" test to <i>all</i> \"voting qualifications,\" <i>anywhere</i> in the country, prohibiting them only in the event that they result in racial discrimination. There is nothing illogical about creating a per se ban on certain <i>presumptively</i> discriminatory qualifications in \"covered jurisdictions\" only, as was done in § 4, but also permitting scrutiny of all voting qualifications nationally, including felon disenfranchisement laws, to ensure that no particular qualification is discriminatory as applied under the particular circumstances. And that is precisely what Congress did through § 2.</p>\n<p>By exporting the legislative history of § 4 into the § 2 context, the majority ignores the very plausible interpretation that Congress intended § 2 to include felony disenfranchisement laws precisely <i>because</i> it chose to exclude them from § 4's list of categorically barred regulations. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*56</span> While Congress did not seek to have felon disenfranchisement banned in all cases, it nevertheless intended that they be subjected, just like every other voting qualification anywhere in the country, to a \"totality of the circumstances\" test to assess whether they effectuate a discriminatory <i>result.</i> The fact that members of Congress were sufficiently cognizant of felon disenfranchisement laws to carve them out from the scope of § 4, yet made no such statements in regard to § 2, despite the intentionally broad language of that provision, indicates that Congress did not in fact intend a similar restriction in the § 2 context. <i>See </i><i>Vidal-Reyes,</i> 562 F.3d at 53 (<i>quoting </i><i>United States v. Councilman,</i> 418 F.3d 67, 73 (1st Cir.2005)) (\"`[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.'\").<sup>[37]</sup> Thus, as it stands, the legislative history of § 4 shows that while Congress did not intend to enact a blanket ban on felon disenfranchisement laws as a prohibited \"moral character\" requirement neither did it intend to exclude discriminatory laws from the scope of VRA scrutiny.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Historical Legitimacy and Congressional Endorsement of Felon Disenfranchisement Law</h2>\n<p>The remainder of the arguments in the majority opinion rely on Congress' sanctioning or presupposing the validity of felon disenfranchisement in various contexts, such as where (1) it has rejected proposals to outright bar felon disenfranchisement, either through the VRA or otherwise, and (2) endorsed disenfranchisement laws generally in the aftermath of the VRA. First of all, \"subsequent legislative history will rarely override a reasonable interpretation of a statute that can be gleaned from its language and legislative history prior to its enactment.\" <i>Solid Waste Agency of N. Cook County v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng'rs,</i> 531 U.S. 159, 170 n. 5, 121 S.Ct. 675, 148 L.Ed.2d 576 (2001) (quoting <i>Consumer Prod. Safety Comm'n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc.,</i> 447 U.S. 102, 118 n. 13, 100 S.Ct. 2051, 64 L.Ed.2d 766 (1980)). But more importantly, these arguments are entirely irrelevant to the question before us. Congressional refusal to pass categorical prohibitions on felon disenfranchisement or even its subsequent affirmation of the practice generally, is not inconsistent with Congress's clear intent to subject to scrutiny, through § 2 of the VRA, \"<i>any</i> state enactment which altered the election law of a covered State in even a minor way.\" <i>Allen,</i> 393 U.S. at 566-67, 89 S.Ct. 817 (emphasis added). Congress may very well have decided not to bar felon disenfranchisement wholesale (as it did by omitting it from § 4) and may even have endorsed the practice where it was motivated by and served legitimate ends. But it may have nevertheless chosen, in order to make the guarantees of the Fifteenth Amendment meaningful, to restrict the adoption of this \"qualification\" in those cases where it is applied \"in a manner which results\" in the denial of the right to vote on account of race. This reading of the legislative history, which is consistent with the statutory text, is far more compelling than the majority's analysis.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, \"the plainer the language, the more convincing contrary legislative history must be to overcome the natural purport of a statute's language.\" <i>United</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*57</span> <i>States v. U.S. Steel Corp.,</i> 482 F.2d 439, 444 (7th Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 414 U.S. 909, 94 S.Ct. 229, 38 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973). I see a clear textual mandate, uncontradicted by <i>any</i> legislative history, that felon disenfranchisement laws, like all voting qualifications, may be challenged under § 2 of the VRA. \"If the language of law is to have any meaning at all, then surely it must prevail over the kind of speculation that is entailed in such an enterprise as th[is] court[ ] ha[s] undertaken.\" <i>United States ex rel. Siller v. Becton Dickinson &amp; Co.,</i> 21 F.3d 1339, 1355 (4th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p>The plain language of the statute being as clear as it is, and the legislative history and purpose only bolstering that clarity, I cannot help but speculate that the majority is jumping through hoops to defeat the remedial purpose for which the provision was enacted in order to produce a result consistent with its own preference in policy. But \"[t]he Fifteenth Amendment empowers `Congress,' not the [c]ourt[s], to determine in the first instance what legislation is needed to enforce it.\" <i>Nw. Austin,</i> 557 U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. at *2513. And even if we \"question the wisdom of Congress's decision to enact a statute that permits challenging felon disenfranchisement laws, we are judges, not policy-makers.\" <i>Hayden,</i> 449 F.3d at 348 (Parker, J., dissenting). \"The duty of a judge is to follow the law, not to question its plain terms.\" <i>Id.,</i> 449 F.3d at 368 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). \"I do not believe that Congress wishes us to disregard the plain language of any statute or to invent exceptions to the statutes it has created.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Finally, I see no constitutional issues posed by interpreting the VRA according to its language and consistent with its purpose, so as to encompass felon disenfranchisement laws. Rather, § 2 of the VRA is firmly within the scope of Congress's power to enforce the Reconstruction amendments, which includes the power to \"enact so-called prophylactic legislation that proscribes facially constitutional conduct, in order to prevent and deter unconstitutional conduct.\" <i>Nev. Dep't of Human Res. v. Hibbs,</i> 538 U.S. 721, 727-28, 123 S.Ct. 1972, 155 L.Ed.2d 953 (2003). Finding challenges to felon disenfranchisement laws to be cognizable under the VRA, I have no trouble concluding that the plaintiffs have stated a claim sufficient to preclude dismissal at this early juncture. Thus, I would affirm the district court's decision on this issue.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Ex Post Facto Clause Claim</h2>\n<p>The second issue raised on appeal, a question of first impression in this circuit, is whether the retroactive application of a felon disenfranchisement provision violates the Ex Post Facto Clause when it is applied to felons incarcerated for crimes committed prior to the provision's passage into law. The Ex Post Facto Clause \"bars application of a law `that changes the punishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed to the crime, when committed[.]'\" <i>Johnson v. United States,</i> 529 U.S. 694, 699, 120 S.Ct. 1795, 146 L.Ed.2d 727 (2000) (quoting <i>Calder v. Bull,</i> 3 U.S. 386, 390, 3 Dall. 386, 1 L.Ed. 648 (1798)); <i>see</i> U.S. Const. art. 1, § 10 (\"No State shall ... pass any ... ex post facto Law.\"). Plaintiffs, incarcerated in Massachusetts for offenses committed prior to Article 120's enactment, contend that Article 120 is unconstitutional as applied to them because it subjects them to additional punishment not provided for by the laws of the Commonwealth when they committed the acts underlying their convictions. The majority affirms the dismissal of plaintiffs' claim on grounds that the deprivation of the right to vote, as accomplished by Article 120, does not constitute \"punishment,\" and thus, falls outside the protections of the Ex Post Facto Clause. I <span class=\"star-pagination\">*58</span> cannot agree. While disenfranchising convicted felons prospectively might be perfectly constitutional, I would hold that the disenfranchisement provision here is a punitive measure, which cannot be retroactively applied.</p>\n<p>\"The deprivation of any rights, civil or political, previously enjoyed, may be punishment, the circumstances attending and the causes of the deprivation determining this fact.\" <i>Cummings v. Missouri,</i> 4 Wall. 277, 71 U.S. 277, 320, 18 L.Ed. 356 (1866). As the majority accurately explains, analysis of whether a particular enactment imposes retroactive <i>punishment</i> so as to implicate the Ex Post Facto Clause requires a two-part inquiry. The first part asks whether the challenged law has a civil, regulatory purpose, or whether it is intended to punish. <i>See </i><i>Smith v. Doe,</i> 538 U.S. 84, 92, 123 S.Ct. 1140, 155 L.Ed.2d 164 (2002) (<i>citing </i><i>Kansas v. Hendricks,</i> 521 U.S. 346, 361, 117 S.Ct. 2072, 138 L.Ed.2d 501 (1997)). If a court finds that the law was intended to be punitive, then it constitutes \"punishment\" for purposes of the Ex Post Facto Clause and would violate the clause if retroactively applied. <i>Id.</i> However, if the law conveys a non-punitive, regulatory purpose, the court moves to the second part of the test to ascertain whether the law is \"so punitive either in purpose or effect as to negate [the state's] intention to deem it civil.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>United States v. Ward,</i> 448 U.S. 242, 248-49, 100 S.Ct. 2636, 65 L.Ed.2d 742 (1980)). The ultimate question is \"whether [Article 120] is intended to be, or by its nature necessarily is, criminal and punitive, or civil and remedial.\" <i>United States v. One Assortment of 89 Firearms,</i> 465 U.S. 354, 362, 104 S.Ct. 1099, 79 L.Ed.2d 361 (1984).</p>\n<p>While legislative purpose is not easily discernible given the unique procedural history of Article 120's enactment by popular referendum, I nevertheless find that a close look at the provision's language and history reveals that it was intended by its proponents to be a primarily punitive measure. Moreover, even if the <i>primary</i> intent behind the enactment of Article 120 could not be clearly identified,<sup>[38]</sup> I would find this disenfranchisement law to be so punitive in effect that it nevertheless constitutes a criminal punishment under the second prong of <i>Smith.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. The Legislative Intent Was Punitive</h2>\n<p>We first ask whether Article 120 was intended to be a civil or criminal measure. <i>See </i><i>Smith,</i> 538 U.S. at 92, 123 S.Ct. 1140. Determining whether Article 120 was intended to be civil or criminal \"`is first of all a question of statutory construction.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Hendricks,</i> 521 U.S. at 361, 117 S.Ct. 2072). As this court has made clear, analysis of statutory construction \"begin[s] with the language of the statute.\" <i>Phillips v. Pembroke Real Estate, Inc.,</i> 459 F.3d 128, 139 (1st Cir.2006) (quoting <i>Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co.,</i> 534 U.S. 438, 450, 122 S.Ct. 941, 151 L.Ed.2d 908 (2002)). Yet, in holding that Article 120 conveys a regulatory intent, the majority again departs from this well-established framework.</p>\n<p>The majority disposes of the first prong of <i>Smith</i> by citing <i>Trop v. Dulles</i> for the proposition that \"felon disenfranchisement provisions are considered regulatory rather than punitive.\" <i>See</i> 356 U.S. 86, 94, 78 S.Ct. 590, 2 L.Ed.2d 630 (1958). But leaving aside the merits of this proposition for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*59</span> the moment, the fact that disenfranchisement provisions are <i>generally</i> considered regulatory rather than punitive is not dispositive of what the Massachusetts voters and legislators intended here. Rather, the relevant questions are what Article 120's particular language says and if there are any inferences that can be drawn from its broader structure. <i>See </i><i>Smith,</i> 538 U.S. at 92, 123 S.Ct. 1140 (instructing that we should first \"consider the statute's text and its structure to determine the legislative objective\"). \"[C]onsiderable deference must be accorded to the intent as the legislature has stated it.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>In this case, looking at the text of Article 120, there is no indication on the face of the provision of the legislative intent behind its enactment. Article 120, which was passed pursuant to a ballot question placed before Commonwealth voters, lacks any kind of express \"statement of purpose\" which legislation often includes, and none of its language reveals a particular government interest in felon disenfranchisement, either regulatory or punitive.<sup>[39]</sup> Instead, Article 120 merely lays out the substantive voting requirements, including the newly enacted exclusion of incarcerated felons.</p>\n<p>Beyond the language of the provision, it is possible that the \"broader structure\" of the provision may provide some indication of its purpose. <i>Id.</i> The majority relies on the placement of Article 120 within the Commonwealth's civil voter qualification provisions, rather than in its criminal code, to infer a regulatory purpose. But while manner of codification is certainly one factor relevant to ascertaining the nature of a provision, the Supreme Court has held that the \"location and labels of a statutory provision do not by themselves transform a civil remedy into a criminal one,\" or vice versa. <i>Smith,</i> 538 U.S. at 94, 123 S.Ct. 1140; <i>see also </i><i>Trop,</i> 356 U.S. at 94, 78 S.Ct. 590 (\"How simple would be the tasks of constitutional adjudication and of law generally if specific problems could be solved by inspection of the labels pasted on them! Manifestly the issue of whether [a statute] is a penal law cannot be thus determined.\"). Rather, the Supreme Court instructs that \"a penalty [] cannot be converted into [a non-penal measure] by so naming it,\" and we must \"ascribe to [the particular statute] the character disclosed by its purpose and operation, regardless of name.\" <i>United States v. Constantine,</i> 296 U.S. 287, 294, 56 S.Ct. 223, 80 L.Ed. 233 (1935) (holding that even though labeled a \"tax\" on conducting retail liquor business, challenged statute was nevertheless a \"penalty\" designed to punish the violation of state liquor laws). Likewise, \"even a clear legislative classification of a statute as `non-penal' would not alter the fundamental nature of a plainly penal statute.\" <i>Trop,</i> 356 U.S. at 95, 78 S.Ct. 590 (holding that a statute stripping army deserters of citizenship is a \"penal law\" despite its codification amidst the regulatory provisions of the \"Nationality Act\"); <i>see also </i><i>One Assortment of 89 Firearms,</i> 465 U.S. at 364-65, 104 S.Ct. 1099 (holding a forfeiture provision to be a civil action despite its codification in the state's criminal code). It follows that the Commonwealth's authority to regulate voting requirements as part of its civil power does not, in and of itself, establish that Article 120 was intended as a regulatory measure.</p>\n<p>Moreover, any inference of legislative intent that could be drawn from the codification of Article 120 in a civil section of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*60</span> Massachusetts' constitution is undermined by the fact that the Commonwealth was <i>required</i> to amend that constitutional provision, which governs voting qualifications generally, in order to disenfranchise felons. In addition, the subject matter of Article 120 is consistent not only with civil voting requirements, but also with criminal rules imposing an additional deprivation upon persons convicted of particular crimes and in the custody of the criminal justice system. In that sense, Article 120's broader structure implies both criminal punishment and civil regulation. In sum, neither the language nor the structure of Article 120 betrays a clear regulatory or punitive intent.</p>\n<p>Without a clear indication of intended purpose from Article 120 itself, we look to legislative history for evidence of legislative intent.<sup>[40]</sup><i>Rolland v. Romney,</i> 318 F.3d 42, 48 (1st Cir.2003). Here, there are two helpful sources of legislative history public statements made by Massachusetts' politicians about a series of disenfranchisement proposals that ultimately resulted in Article 120,<sup>[41]</sup> and the \"Information for Voters\" Guide (\"the Guide\") that was distributed to voters at the law's ratification stage.</p>\n<p>First, the public statements of proponents of the legislation are quite revealing of the punitive motivation behind Article 120. Writing to the Massachusetts Legislature to propose an earlier version of the instant disenfranchisement law, Governor Cellucci argued that \"the time has come to tell would-be criminals in Massachusetts that committing crimes has serious consequences.\"<sup>[42]</sup> He advocated for the proposal because it would \"ensure that criminals pay their debt to society before they regain their right to participate in the political process.\" Governor Cellucci also argued in favor of disenfranchising incarcerated felons because \"prisons are a place for punishment.\" Striking a similar tone, State Representative Paul Frost argued that prisoners \"don't deserve to vote\" and that \"this is an issue about justice.\" Senator Guy Glodis advocated for the law by stating that \"philosophically, no inmates deserve the right to vote.\" These comments, reflecting classic punitive rationales, <i>see, infra,</i> section II.B.4 (discussing traditional theories of criminal punishment), provide strong evidence that Article 120 was motivated by an intent to punish felons.</p>\n<p>As the majority recognizes, the Guide for voters regarding the ballot question <span class=\"star-pagination\">*61</span> that culminated in the enactment of Article 120, is also relevant to deciphering legislative intent. The Guide stated that the proposal would change the law that \"allows criminals to continue to exercise control over our lives by voting from prison.\" The majority found such language to indicate regulatory intent. I disagree. While this language is more ambiguous as to intent than anything else, it suggests to me another retributive statement about what felons \"deserve,\" i.e. to have their right to participate in government revoked. <i>See id.</i> The Guide also stated that \"[a] yes vote will protect democracy's greatest giftthe right to vote, by reserving it for the law-abiding.\" I believe this language is further evidence of the punitive principle of \"just desert.\" In any event, the ambiguous indications of intent revealed by the Guide do not outweigh the plainly punitive comments by the measure's proponents.</p>\n<p>Confronted with potentially mixed manifestations of legislative purposeand I believe such a characterization is generous to the Commonwealth's positionthis court should decipher the law's \"<i>primary</i> function.\" <i>See </i><i>Mendoza-Martinez,</i> 372 U.S. at 169, 83 S.Ct. 554 (emphasis added). Whereas Article 120 itself is unclear as to intent, the Guide is also, at best, ambiguous, and the statements made by Massachusetts politicians are strongly indicative of punitive intent, I find that plaintiffs have made a compelling argument that the weight of the evidence of intent reveals Article 120 to have been intended primarily as a punitive measure. This punitive measure having been applied to plaintiffs retroactively, I believe that an Ex Post Facto violation could be found without further inquiry. But in an abundance of caution, I will proceed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. The Effect of Article 120 Is Punitive</h2>\n<p>Under the second prong of the <i>Smith</i> analysis, even if a clear punitive intent is not discernable for the challenged law, it would nevertheless constitute a criminal punishment subject to the Ex Post Facto Clause if the measure's effect is so punitive as to negate any intent to deem it civil. <i>Hendricks,</i> 521 U.S. at 361, 117 S.Ct. 2072 (citing <i>Ward</i> 448 U.S. at 248-49, 100 S.Ct. 2636). The majority correctly explains that, in order to gauge the actual effect of the law, this court reviews the seven factors described in <i>Mendoza-Martinez:</i></p>\n<blockquote>[ (1) ] Whether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint, [(2)] whether it has historically been regarded as a punishment, [(3)] whether it comes into play only on a finding of scienter, [ (4) ] whether its operation will promote the traditional aims of punishment-retribution and deterrence, [(5)] whether the behavior to which it applies is already a crime, [(6)] whether an alternative purpose to which it may rationally be connected is assignable for it, and [ (7) ] whether it appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned.</blockquote>\n<p><i>See </i><i>Mendoza-Martinez,</i> 372 U.S. at 168-69, 83 S.Ct. 554 (footnotes omitted). These factors, which are \"neither exhaustive nor dispositive,\" serve as \"useful guideposts.\" <i>Smith,</i> 538 U.S. at 97, 123 S.Ct. 1140 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p>I agree with the majority that, where the legislature has <i>clearly stated a civil regulatory intent</i> in enacting the challenged sanction, `\"only the clearest proof' will suffice to override legislative intent and transform what has been denominated a civil remedy into a criminal penalty.\" <i>Hudson v. United States,</i> 522 U.S. 93, 100, 118 S.Ct. 488, 139 L.Ed.2d 450 (1997) (quoting <i>Ward,</i> 448 U.S. at 249, 100 S.Ct. 2636). However, I disagree that plaintiffs should be held to that burden, in this case, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*62</span> where the legislative intent is ambiguous at best. The Supreme Court has not resolved this particular question directly. However, where the legislature fails to make its intent clear through express language, or by implication through a law's broader structure, or even through legislative history, there is strong support for the proposition that a challenged law should be subjected to neutral evaluation when determining its effect. <i>See </i><i>Mendoza-Martinez,</i> 372 U.S. at 169, 83 S.Ct. 554 (holding that, \"[a]bsent conclusive evidence of congressional intent as to the penal nature of a statute, these factors must be considered in relation to the statute on its face\"); <i>Smith,</i> 538 U.S. at 107, 123 S.Ct. 1140 (Souter, J., concurring) (distinguishing between cases where the legislative intent is clear and those where it is ambiguous, and rejecting the \"clearest proof\" burden where it is ambiguous). Accordingly, I would approach the application of the <i>Mendoza-Martinez</i> factors, without any starting presumption, to determine whether the actual purpose or effect of Article 120 is punitive. <i>See </i><i>Mendoza-Martinez,</i> 372 U.S. at 168-69, 83 S.Ct. 554. Applying the most relevant of these factors to the inquiry before us, I find that each of them weighs in favor of recognizing Article 120 to be a penal measure subject to the Ex Post Facto Clause.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Scienter &amp; Criminality</h2>\n<p>The third and fifth <i>Mendoza-Martinez</i> factors, \"whether the challenged sanction comes into place only on a finding of scienter,\" and relatedly, \"whether the behavior to which it applies is already a crime,\" weigh heavily in favor of concluding that Article 120 is a penal statute. <i>See id.</i> at 168, 83 S.Ct. 554. First of all, \"the disciplinary sanction here [is] triggered by a criminal conviction which incorporate[s] a finding of criminal intent, and so the disciplinary sanction came into play `only on a finding of scienter,'\" <i>Porter v. Coughlin,</i> 421 F.3d 141, 147 (2d Cir.2005) (quoting <i>Mendoza-Martinez,</i> 372 U.S. at 168, 83 S.Ct. 554). Similarly, as Article 120 applies only to persons who have already been convicted of a felony, \"the behavior to which it applies is [undoubtedly] already a crime,\" as the fifth <i>Mendoza-Martinez</i> factor requires. <i>Mendoza-Martinez,</i> 372 U.S. at 168, 83 S.Ct. 554; <i>see also </i><i>Dep't of Revenue of Montana v. Kurth Ranch,</i> 511 U.S. 767, 781, 114 S.Ct. 1937, 128 L.Ed.2d 767 (1994) (noting that fact that a tax on marijuana was \"conditioned on the commission of a crime\" is \"`significant of [its] penal and prohibitory intent'\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. History</h2>\n<p>The second <i>Mendoza-Martinez</i> factor asks whether a particular sanction has \"historically been regarded as punishment.\" <i>Id.</i> at 168, 83 S.Ct. 554. There is substantial evidence to this effect. First of all, federal courts have frequently characterized felon disenfranchisement as a punitive measure. In its decision in <i>Johnson,</i> the Eleventh Circuit described felon disenfranchisement laws as a \"punitive device stemming from criminal law\" and explained that \"throughout history, criminal disenfranchisement provisions have existed as a punitive device.\" <i>See</i> 405 F.3d at 1228 &amp; n. 5. Similarly, the Second Circuit has noted the \"nearly universal use of felon disenfranchisement as a punitive device.\" <i>Muntaqim v. Coombe,</i> 366 F.3d 102, 123 (2d Cir.2004) (vacated en banc on other grounds). \"Congress [has also] recognized the punitive nature of felon disenfranchisement laws.\" <i>See</i> Pamela A. Wilkins, <i>The Mark of Cain: Disenfranchised Felons and the Constitutional No Man's Land,</i> 56 Syracuse L.Rev. 85, 133-34 (2005) (describing how Congressional acts readmitting former Confederate States to the Union did so on the condition that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*63</span> States prohibited disenfranchisement \"except as a punishment for ... crimes\"). This point is reinforced by renowned historian, Alexander Keyssar's review of voting rights in this country in which he unequivocally characterizes America's felon disenfranchisement laws as an intentionally punitive device. <i>Id.</i> (citing Alexander Keyssar, <i>The Right to Vote: The Contested History of Democracy in the United States</i> 316 (2000)). And the ALI's Model Penal Code, a compilation examining the penal law of the United States, labels prisoner disenfranchisement \"an integral part of the criminal law.\" Model Penal Code § 306.3 (Proposed Official Draft 1962). This is strong evidence that, regardless of how a particular disenfranchisement provision is codified, the purpose of disenfranchising felons in American history has been to punish them for their crimes.</p>\n<p>There is also substantial evidence, presented by plaintiffs, of the historical use of felon disenfranchisement as a penal mechanism throughout the world. <i>See </i><i>Hayden,</i> 449 F.3d at 315-16 (describing use of \"civil death\" laws in Medieval continental Europe, \"attainder\" laws in medieval England, and \"infamy\" laws in ancient Greece and Rome, all of which revoked political rights, including the right to vote, \"as additional punishment for [certain] crimes\"); Keyssar, <i>supra,</i> at 62-63 (\"Disenfranchisement for [infamous] crimes had a long history in English, European, and even Roman law, and it [is] hardly surprising that the principle of attaching civil disabilities to the commission of crimes appeared in American law as well.\"). Although the district court dismissed this evidence as not relevant to disenfranchisement provisions in <i>American</i> history, that approach misreads this factor as used in <i>Mendoza-Martinez.</i> In fact, in <i>Mendoza-Martinez</i> itself, the Supreme Court explicitly relied on the history of citizenship deprivation in other countries in determining that the challenged law depriving draft evaders of citizenship was punitive in effect. <i>See</i> 372 U.S. at 168 n. 23, 83 S.Ct. 554 (discussing Roman and English societies' use of forfeiting citizenship as a punishment). Thus, evidence of the historical use of felony disenfranchisement laws both in this country and others is relevant, and both reveal the prevalent historic use of such laws as a penal mechanism.</p>\n<p>To refute the extensive evidence that disenfranchisement laws have been historically regarded as punitive, the majority cites one court decision that did not concern the disenfranchisement of felons, <i>Trop. See</i> 356 U.S. at 96-97, 78 S.Ct. 590. <i>Trop</i> does contain <i>dicta</i> suggesting hypothetically that \"the purpose of [a felon disenfranchisement statute] is to designate a reasonable ground of eligibility for voting,\" <i>id.,</i> but as <i>dicta,</i> that language is not binding upon us. <i>See</i> Wilkins, <i>supra,</i> at 102 (arguing that \"<i>Trop's</i> discussion of disenfranchisement statutes was <i>dicta</i> and, therefore, does not excuse judges from the hard work necessary to analyze real disenfranchisement laws\"). <i>Trop</i> also explains alternatively, that if \"[disenfranchisement] were imposed for the purpose of punishing [an offender], the statute[ ] would be penal.\" 356 U.S. at 96-97, 78 S.Ct. 590. Moreover, that decision says nothing about how such laws have <i>historically</i> been regarded. In any event, the problem with relying on <i>Trop</i>'s suggestion that felon disenfranchisement could be a \"reasonable ground of eligibility for voting,\" is that <i>Trop</i> fails to reveal what legitimate purpose disenfranchisement serves that would render it a \"reasonable ground.\" This failure to identify why disqualifying felons is a \"reasonable ground\" is particularly problematic in light of the fact that both cases cited by <i>Trop</i> for this proposition, <i>Davis v. Beason</i> and <i>Murphy v. Ramsey</i><i>,</i> involve voting qualifications that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*64</span> are no longer regarded as valid.<sup>[43]</sup> As several scholars argue, <i>Trop</i> was decided at a time when the government had virtually unrestricted power to regulate the franchise, prior to the Warren's court's curtailment of that power when it recognized the fundamental nature of voting rights. <i>See</i> Wilkins, <i>supra,</i> at 102-04; Pamela S. Karlan, <i>Convictions and Doubts: Retribution, Representation, and the Debate Over Felon Disenfranchisement,</i> 56 Stan. L.Rev. 1147, 1150-54 (2004). As such, scholars argue that the <i>dicta</i> in <i>Trop</i> regarding the regulatory nature of felon disenfranchisement laws was premised on an \"outdated conception of voting rights,\" rendering its continued validity questionable. Wilkins, <i>supra,</i> at 102-04.</p>\n<p>Thus, seeing sparse evidence to the contrary, I am persuaded that the evidence cited by plaintiffs of the historical use of disenfranchisement weighs in favor of deeming the practice to be a punitive device.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Affirmative Disability or Restraint</h2>\n<p>In light of this country's struggle for independence in pursuit of participatory democracy and the centrality attributed to the right to vote in our legal and political culture,<sup>[44]</sup> I am compelled to conclude that the deprivation of the franchise is an \"affirmative disability or restraint\" of the gravest sort.</p>\n<p>Yet the majority concludes otherwise. In support of its holding that felon disenfranchisement does not constitute criminal punishment, the majority concludes that Article 120 does not impose \"any affirmative disability or restraint, physical or otherwise.\" To the extent the majority suggests that a restraint need be \"physical\" in order to resemble a punitive sanction, such a requirement simply does not exist. Rather, <i>Smith</i> discusses physical restraints as only <i>one</i> kind of possible restraint a criminal law might impose. <i>Smith,</i> 538 U.S. at 100, 123 S.Ct. 1140. In fact, our society regularly punishes wrongdoers without actually imposing physical restraints on them, most commonly, with criminal fines. And Supreme Court decisions tasked with applying the <i>Mendoza-Martinez</i> factors to ascertain the penal or regulatory nature of a particular sanction have regularly found <i>non-physical</i> sanctions to be affirmative disabilities or restraints. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Kurth Ranch,</i> 511 U.S. at 774, 114 S.Ct. 1937 (holding a tax on illegal drugs to be a punitive measure in part because it \"allowed for sanctions by restraint of Debtors' property\"). In fact, <i>Mendoza-Martinez</i> itself held a non-physical sanction, the deprivation of citizenship, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*65</span> to constitute a sanction \"essentially penal in character.\"</p>\n<p>The majority also argues that disenfranchisement during incarceration is not an affirmative disability because it is \"not as enduring as permanent occupational debarment.\" <i>See </i><i>Hawker v. New York,</i> 170 U.S. 189, 18 S.Ct. 573, 42 L.Ed. 1002 (1898) (holding that revocation of medical license does not violate the Ex Post Facto clause). But revoking a license to practice a particular profession is also not the deprivation of a <i>fundamental right.</i> In holding the revocation of citizenship rights to be punitive in <i>Mendoza-Martinez,</i> the Supreme Court emphasized that it is the \"utmost import\" and \"value\" of citizenship rights that renders their deprivation among the gravest of sanctions. <i>Mendoza-Martinez,</i> 372 U.S. at 160, 83 S.Ct. 554. Like citizenship itself, the right to vote, a fundamental component of citizenship, is certainly comparable in its utmost value and importance. <i>Tashjian v. Republican Party,</i> 479 U.S. 208, 217, 107 S.Ct. 544, 93 L.Ed.2d 514 (1986) (noting that the right to vote is a fundamental right inherent in citizenship). It is the <i>importance</i> of the right to vote that renders the gravity of its deprivation so devastating a \"disability.\" <i>See </i><i>Reynolds v. Sims,</i> 377 U.S. 533, 555, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 12 L.Ed.2d 506 (1964) (\"The right to vote freely for the candidate of one's choice is of the essence of a democratic society, and any restrictions on that right strikes at the heart of representative government.\"); <i>Igartúa-De La Rosa v. United States,</i> 417 F.3d 145, 177 (1st Cir. 2005) (Torruella, J., dissenting) (\"There are few countries in the world in which the right to vote is as exalted as it is in the United States.\"); <i>McLaughlin v. City of Canton,</i> 947 F.Supp. 954, 971 (S.D.Miss. 1995) (describing disenfranchisement as the harshest sanction imposed by a democratic society and noting that when one is \"brought beneath its axe, the disenfranchised is severed from the body politic and condemned to the lowest form of citizenship, where voiceless at the ballot box the disenfranchised, the disinherited must sit idly by while others elect his civic leaders and while others choose the fiscal and governmental policies that will govern him and his family\"). Disenfranchisement, though neither physical nor permanent, deprives U.S. citizens of a fundamental right, and as such, is undoubtedly an affirmative disability.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. Traditional Aims of Punishment</h2>\n<p>The fourth <i>Mendoza-Martinez</i> factor provides that a sanction is more likely punitive if \"its operation will promote the traditional aims of punishmentretribution and deterrence.\" <i>Mendoza-Martinez,</i> 372 U.S. at 168, 83 S.Ct. 554; <i>see also </i><i>Bell v. Wolfish,</i> 441 U.S. 520, 539, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979) (noting that the Supreme Court has established that \"[r]etribution and deterrence are not legitimate <i>nonpunitive</i> governmental objectives\" (emphasis added)).<sup>[45]</sup> Of course, the threat of being deprived of a fundamental right will, to a certain extent, always operate to deter a rational person from engaging in unlawful conduct.<sup>[46]</sup> But as the Supreme <span class=\"star-pagination\">*66</span> Court has recognized, the deterrent effect of a sanction cannot be wholly dispositive of criminal punishment as all civil penalties have some deterrent effect. <i>See </i><i>Kurth Ranch,</i> 511 U.S. at 777, 114 S.Ct. 1937. It is, however, in its <i>retributive</i> nature that felon disenfranchisement truly reveals its punitive colors. <i>See</i> Karlan, <i>supra,</i> at 1166 (arguing that \"disenfranchisement really can be justified only under a retributive theory of criminal punishment\"). In this sense, this factor also conclusively weighs in favor of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p>As a form of retribution, \"`[p]unishment is the way in which society expresses its denunciation of wrongdoing.'\" <i>Gregg v. Georgia,</i> 428 U.S. 153, 184 n. 30, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 49 L.Ed.2d 859. The notion is that the offender \"owes a debt to society\" and \"must now atone for his sins by suffering punishment for his transgression.\" Peter W. Low et. al., Criminal Law 2 (1982). \"This ... conception of punishment ... makes primary the meting out to a responsible wrongdoer of his just deserts.\" H.L.A. Hart, <i>Punishment and Responsibility,</i> 158-59 (1968). Other scholars have characterized the retributive aim of criminal punishment as predicated upon the notion of restoring the status quo after an offender, by his contravention of the law, has usurped from his victim or from society generally, something to which he is not fairly entitled. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Herbert Morris, <i>Guilt and Innocence,</i> 33-36 (1976) (characterizing punishment as restoring the fair distribution of benefits and burdens that is displaced when a person violates the rules that others have assumed, thereby gaining an unfair advantage); Jean Hampton, <i>Retributivism and Its Critics</i> (1992) (characterizing retributive punishment as a message that restores the prior status hierarchy between victim and offender which was violated by an offender's degradation of a victim's worth through criminality).</p>\n<p>In the context of the retributive purposes of criminal punishment, it becomes apparent how fundamentally intertwined criminal disenfranchisement laws generally, and Article 120 in particular, are with this punitive objective. The statement from Governor Cellucci's letter, referenced <i>supra,</i> that the disenfranchisement proposal would \"ensure that criminals pay their debt to society\" is the textbook articulation of the retributive theory. Similarly, Representative Frost's statement that felons do not \"deserve to vote\" is fundamentally linked to the retributive notion of \"just deserts.\" And Representative Marini's promise that the law would apply to those who did \"despicable things\" is consistent with theory of retributive punishment as a means by which society expresses its moral denunciation of unlawful conduct.</p>\n<p>Moreover, even the statements contained in the Information for Voters guide, cited by the Commonwealth as evidencing a regulatory non-punitive purpose, in fact, reveal the opposite when considered in the context of criminal punishment theory. For example, the statement that Article 120 would change the law that \"allows criminals to continue to exercise control over our lives by voting from prison,\" is consistent with Morris' and Hampton's notions of retributive punishment as a means of restoring the proper hierarchy between the offender and society, unfairly tipped in the offender's favor by his desecration of society's rules. By preventing offenders from benefitting further, at society's expense, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*67</span> through their political participation, disenfranchisement helps to restore that lost equilibrium. Finally, felon disenfranchisement laws, by \"deny[ing] the civic and human dignity of persons who have been convicted of doing wrong,\" are emblematic of the denunciatory function of criminal law. <i>See </i><i>Bell,</i> 441 U.S. at 592-93 n. 26, 99 S.Ct. 1861 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (citing letter from Learned Hand to the University of Chicago Law Review).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>5. Connection to Non-Punitive Purpose</h2>\n<p>The sixth <i>Mendoza-Martinez</i> factor asks \"whether an alternative purpose to which [the challenged sanction] may rationally be connected is assignable for it.\" 372 U.S. at 168-69, 83 S.Ct. 554.</p>\n<p>I note, as a threshold matter and as discussed above, that there was no legitimate non-punitive purpose expressly assigned to Article 120, and that the purpose of the statute as revealed by its legislative history is primarily punitive. But even if we were to speculate as to non-punitive rationales <i>potentially</i> assignable to the provision, I simply cannot agree with the majority that there is an \"obvious rational <i>non-punitive</i> purpose for disenfranchisement.\" The reality is that \"[c]ourts have been hard pressed to define the state interest served by laws disenfranchising persons convicted of crimes.\" <i>Dillenburg v. Kramer,</i> 469 F.2d 1222, 1224-25 (9th Cir. 1972) (\"Appellee does not explain why disenfranchisement of those convicted of offenses that can result in confinement in state prison is `necessary' to vindicate any identified state interest.\"); <i>see also </i><i>Stephens v. Yeomans,</i> 327 F.Supp. 1182, 1188 (D.N.J.1970) (striking down New Jersey felon disenfranchisement law because court \"perceive[d] no rational basis for the... classification\" of felons as a group that could not vote).</p>\n<p>My reading of the legislative history of Article 120, much of which indicates a punitive motivation, and the lack of a sufficient rational nexus to any non-punitive purpose, suggest that any purported regulatory motivations are, in fact, disingenuous. Moreover, the potential non-punitive rationales for felon disenfranchisement are, in many cases, now regarded as illegitimate grounds for restricting the vote, and as such, should not be credited. <i>See </i><i>Trop,</i> 356 U.S. at 96, 78 S.Ct. 590 (holding that a statute is non-penal \"if it imposes a disability, not to punish but to accomplish some other <i>legitimate governmental purpose.</i>\" (emphasis added)). That leaves criminal punishment as the only legitimate discernible \"legislative aim\" behind Article 120. I will consider, in turn, the various non-punitive justifications potentially assignable to Article 120 and explain why each cannot be rationally assignable to it.</p>\n<p>First, the majority suggests that the \"obvious rational non-punitive purpose for disenfranchisement\" is the concern about felons \"exercis[ing] control over [people's] lives by voting from prison.\" But as explained <i>supra,</i> this concern actually boils down to the punitive sentiment that felons do not \"deserve\" to do so.</p>\n<p>Second, the Commonwealth argues, on appeal, that the purpose of Article 120, evidenced by its placement alongside other valid voter qualifications in the Massachusetts constitution, was to exempt from the franchise those persons \"deem[ed] unfit to vote,\" such as minors, persons under guardianships, and persons convicted of corrupt election practices. That argument rests on the principle that, due to their lack of respect for the criminal law, felons, like minors and mentally incompetent persons, \"have raised questions about their ability to vote responsibly,\" and therefore, \"cannot be trusted\" to do so. Given the absence of any reference to voter \"competence\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*68</span> in the legislative history of Article 120, and the weak connection between disenfranchising incarcerated felons and the alleged interest in responsible voting, I am inclined to dismiss this explanation as a pre-textual rationale masking a punitive purpose. <i>See </i><i>Hendricks,</i> 521 U.S. at 371, 117 S.Ct. 2072 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (\"If the object or purpose of the Kansas law had been to provide treatment but the treatment provisions were adopted as a sham or mere pretext, there would have been an indication of the forbidden purpose to punish.\"). This is because disenfranchising felons is both under and over-inclusive of this alleged rationale. It is under-inclusive because if persons who violate the law have shown that they cannot vote responsibly, then not only incarcerated felons, but all persons who commit any kind of crime should be disenfranchised, whether they are serving a custodial sentence or not. Moreover, all citizens who for any reason have shown themselves to be irresponsible voters should be disenfranchised as well. It is over-inclusive because some incarcerated felons, despite their prior transgressions, may have, through the rehabilitative elements of their sentence, developed great respect for society's rules. While it is true that \"[a] statute is not deemed punitive simply because it lacks a <i>close or perfect</i> fit with the non-punitive aims it seeks to advance,\" <i>Smith,</i> 538 U.S. at 102-03, 123 S.Ct. 1140 (emphasis added), the connection here seems especially attenuated, especially in light of the fundamental right that is at stake. This suggests that the concern with felons being \"unqualified\" is \"simply a fictional concern advanced to mask a punitive purpose.\" <i>United States v. Brown,</i> 381 U.S. 437, 446-47, 85 S.Ct. 1707, 14 L.Ed.2d 484 (White, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>More importantly, I question whether the Commonwealth can rely on a felon's purported incapacity to vote responsibly as the \"non-punitive rationale\" for Article 120 given that neither the ability to vote responsibly nor respect for the existing law remain \"reasonable ground[s] of eligibility for voting.\" <i>See </i><i>Trop,</i> 356 U.S. at 96-97, 78 S.Ct. 590. Rather, the idea that a particular group may be disqualified from voting based on a lack of respect for existing criminal law now constitutes a form of viewpoint discrimination that has been expressly rejected. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Romer,</i> 517 U.S. at 634, 116 S.Ct. 1620 (<i>see</i> parenthetical, <i>supra,</i> n. 19); <i>Dunn v. Blumstein,</i> 405 U.S. 330, 354-56, 92 S.Ct. 995, 31 L.Ed.2d 274 (1972) (rejecting durational residency requirements that rested on claims about the desirability of ensuring that citizens understood, and shared, community values before they were permitted to vote); <i>see also </i><i>Carrington v. Rash,</i> 380 U.S. 89, 94, 85 S.Ct. 775, 13 L.Ed.2d 675 (1965) (\"`Fencing out' from the franchise a sector of the population because of the way they may vote is constitutionally impermissible.\"). Thus, according to one scholar, \"contemporary voting rights doctrine casts a serious shadow on the central traditional non-penal justification for felon disenfranchisement: the claim that ex-offenders should not be permitted to vote because they lack the qualities of mind or character voters ought to possess.\" Karlan, <i>supra,</i> at 1152.</p>\n<p>Third, a similar analysis applies to the purported non-punitive \"regulatory\" purpose arbitrarily assigned to Article 120 by the district court. The district court suggested that prisoners are somehow unqualified to participate in the \"participatory and collegial process\" of \"representative democracy\" because they \"have limited access to information and little opportunity to discuss issues with individuals who are not also being punished for breaking the law.\" Not only is this \"inability-to-become-informed\" rationale entirely absent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*69</span> from the discussions motivating the enactment of Article 120, but it is simply not rationally connected with disenfranchising the entire convicted felon population, many of whom may very well have access to newspapers, media, and contact to outside visitors, as well as the leisure time to become politically informed, and thereby, even more knowledgeable voters than law-abiding persons on the \"outside.\" But again, and more importantly, the Supreme Court has consistently rejected restrictions on the franchise in order to further \"knowledgeable or intelligent voting.\" <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Dunn,</i> 405 U.S. at 356, 92 S.Ct. 995. Thus, \"[i]f neither good character nor intelligent use of the ballot nor support for existing criminal laws are generally permissible prerequisites for voting, then it would be perverse to rely on criminal convictions as evidence that individuals lack qualities that voters are not required to have.\" Karlan, <i>supra,</i> at 1155. \"The obvious alternative is to conclude that disenfranchisement is indeed punitive and that if it is to be justified, it must be justified as a legitimate form of punishment, rather than as a species of political regulation.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Finally, that this \"alternative purpose\" factor of the <i>Mendoza-Martinez</i> analysis weighs in favor of deeming Article 120 a punitive sanction is bolstered by examining what has been found to constitute a \"legitimate non-punitive purpose\" in prior <i>Mendoza-Martinez</i> cases, and what has not. That examination reveals that those cases holding particular sanctions to constitute non-punitive regulatory measures have served far clearer and more substantial societal interests than the attenuated justifications provided for felon disenfranchisement. For example, in <i>Hendricks,</i> the state civil commitment law held to be non-punitive was intended to protect the public from dangerous mentally ill persons \"likely to engage in `predatory acts of sexual violence.'\" 521 U.S. at 350, 117 S.Ct. 2072. Similarly, Alaska's sexual offender registration requirement, held to be non-punitive in <i>Smith,</i> had the express purpose of \"protecting the public from sex offenders\" who \"pose a high risk of reoffending.\" 538 U.S. at 93, 123 S.Ct. 1140; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Salerno,</i> 481 U.S. 739, 747, 107 S.Ct. 2095, 95 L.Ed.2d 697 (1987) (holding that preventative detention under Bail Reform Act, justified by the need to prevent \"danger to the community,\" was regulatory and preventative, rather than punitive).</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the provision being challenged before us bears a far greater resemblance to the one at issue in <i>Mendoza-Martinez</i> itself. In <i>Mendoza-Martinez,</i> where \"there was no reference to the societal good that would be wrought by the legislation,\" the Supreme Court concluded that \"the obvious inference\" was that \"Congress was concerned solely with inflicting effective retribution upon this class of draft evaders and, no doubt, on others similarly situated.\" <i>Mendoza-Martinez,</i> 372 U.S. at 182, 83 S.Ct. 554; <i>see also </i><i>Trop,</i> 356 U.S. at 97-98, 78 S.Ct. 590 (holding that statute stripping military deserters of citizenship rights cannot rationally be treated other than as a penal law). Finding no legitimate non-penal interest served by the legislation, the Supreme Court in <i>Mendoza-Martinez</i> did not go on to speculate as to potential alternative justifications. But even if it had, the conceivable legitimate non-penal justification for stripping an American of his citizenship rights for violating a criminal statute prohibiting the evasion of military service, as in <i>Mendoza-Martinez</i> and <i>Trop,</i> is no more substantial than the conceivable justifications for stripping a U.S. citizen of an essential component of those rights (i.e. voting), for violating another criminal statute. Of course, one could argue that by abandoning the obligations of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*70</span> citizenship by evading the military obligations attendant thereto, a person shows that he is not \"competent\" to exercise the benefits and burdens of citizenship, just like one could argue that a person who breaches the criminal law shows that he is not competent to exercise the responsibility of aiding in its enactment. But the Supreme Court has refused to make this leap, and neither should we here. Given the similarities between the respective sanctions<sup>[47]</sup>deprivation of citizenship and deprivation of voting rightsthe lack of any clear non-punitive interest for either sanction, and the similar triggering event for the imposition of each, namely, violation of a criminal law, I think we are compelled by <i>Mendoza-Martinez</i> to hold Article 120 to be a penal measure. Finding Article 120 to be a penal measure, its constitutionality is subject to the constraints of the Ex Post Facto Clause, and violates that clause as retroactively applied to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p>To be abundantly clear, I see nothing constitutionally impermissible about disenfranchising felons as a form of criminal punishment. Criminals who are convicted of serious offenses pursuant to a legitimate process are properly deprived by the state of a panoply of fundamental individual and civil rights. But \"punishment\" must be labeled what it is, and imposed only in compliance with the time-honored constitutional guarantees that legitimate the exercise of that practice. Central among these guarantees is the prohibition against the enactment of ex post facto laws. As Article 120 inflicts a greater punishment upon convicted felons than the law annexed to their crimes when committed, <i>see </i><i>Calder v. Bull,</i> 3 Dall. 386, 390, 1 L.Ed. 648 (1798), I would invalidate its retroactive application. Thus, I would reverse the decision of the district court as to the ex post facto claim, and order that judgment be entered for plaintiffs.</p>\n<p>For the reasons herein stated, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  By \"over-represented\" the complaint referred to the representation of African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans in the prison population compared with their representation in the Massachusetts population at large, but gave no statistics.</p>\n<p>[2]  Vote dilution claims comprise the vast majority of § 2 claims. <i>See</i> E.

Plaintiffs argue that, to the extent § 4 and § 5 (which ban certain practices) are relevant, those later sections demonstrate only that Congress meant § 2(a) to be read broadly. If legislative history is consulted, they argue that the legislative history of § 2 establishes that their claim falls within Congress's intent in enacting § 2.</p>\n<p>[10]  There are questions as to whether a claim of disparate impact is sufficient to state a § 2 vote denial case. <i>See </i><i>Johnson,</i> 405 F.3d at 1235-37 (Tjoflat, J., concurring); <i>see also </i><i>Goosby v.

No. 91-285, § 201, 84 Stat. 314, 315 (current version at 42 U.S.C. § 1973aa) (extending temporary ban to entire nation); Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1975, Pub.L. No. 94-73, § 201, 89 Stat. 400, 400-01 (current version at 42 U.S.C. §§ 1973b-1973c) (making the temporary nationwide ban permanent). Congress never changed its view that felon disenfranchisement laws were not within the reach of the VRA.</p>\n<p>[15]  The 1975 Amendments to the VRA added protections for linguistic minorities and permanently banned literacy tests. 1975 Amendments §§ 203, 207, 89 Stat. at 401-02 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. §§ 1973b(f), 1973l(c)(3)). Nothing in those amendments indicated any intent to broaden the VRA to permit suits against state laws disenfranchising incarcerated felons.</p>\n<p>[16]  The proposed amendment would have authorized \"the Attorney General ... to institute in the name of the United States such actions against States ... including actions for injunctive relief, as he may determine to be necessary to implement the purposes of this title.\" <i>Ex-Offenders Voting Rights: Hearing on H.R. 9020, supra,</i> at 4 (quoting H.R. 9020, 93d Cong. (1973)).</p>\n<p>[17]  Under Supreme Court and circuit precedent, we read both § 2(a) and § 2(b) together and resort to legislative history. The text of § 2(b) is explicit that its purpose is to give content and context to the terms used in § 2(a). The Supreme Court has interpreted both sections together. <i>See </i><i>Bartlett,</i> 129 S.Ct. at 1241 (\"The 1982 amendments ... added... § 2(b), providing a test for determining whether a § 2 violation has occurred.\"); <i>Chisom,</i> 501 U.S. at 395, 111 S.Ct. 2354 (\"The two purposes of the amendment [to § 2] are apparent from its text. Section (a) adopts a results test.... Section (b) provides guidance about how the results test is to be applied.\").\n</p>\n<p>This court's precedent also requires we read §§ 2(a) and 2(b) together and in light of history and context. <i>See </i><i>Metts,</i> 363 F.3d at 10 (\"The Delphic language of the [1982] amendment [to § 2] can be understood only against the background of its legislative history and subsequent Supreme Court interpretation.\").</p>\n<p>[18]  The context of the 1982 amendments confirms our understanding that § 2 was not amended in isolation from the rest of the statute and must be read in conjunction with the other sections, including § 4. The 1982 amendments to § 2 arose in the wake of <i>Bolden</i> because § 5 of the VRA was scheduled for reauthorization in that year by the terms of the 1975 VRA amendments. S. Issacharoff et al., <i>The Law of Democracy</i> 713-14 (rev.2d ed.2002). Indeed, in the House, most debate focused on the structure of the preclearance and bailout provisions of the VRA, while less attention focused on the § 2 amendments. <i>Id.</i> at 716; <i>see also</i> T.M. Boyd &amp; S.J. Markman, <i>The 1982 Amendments to the Voting Rights Act: A Legislative History,</i> 40 Wash. &amp; Lee L.Rev. 1347 (1983).</p>\n<p>[19]  Congress was clear about its intent. The Senate Report states:\n</p>\n<p>This Amendment is designed to make clear that proof of discriminatory intent is not required to establish a violation of Section 2. It thereby restores the legal standards, based on the controlling Supreme Court precedents, which applied in voting discrimination claims prior to the litigation involved in <i>Mobile v. Bolden.</i> The amendment also adds a new subsection to Section 2 which delineates the legal standards under the results test by codifying the leading pre-<i>Bolden</i> vote dilution case, <i>White v. Regester</i><i>.</i> <i>See</i> S.Rep. No. 97-417, at 2, <i>reprinted in</i> 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 177, 179; <i>see also id.</i> at 27, <i>reprinted in</i> 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 205 (\"The `results' standard is meant to restore the pre-<i>Mobile</i> legal standard which governed [vote dilution cases].\").</p>\n<p>[20]  The <i>Bolden</i> plurality also held that the \"language of § 2 [of the VRA] no more than elaborates upon that of the Fifteenth Amendment, and the sparse legislative history of § 2 makes clear that it was intended to have an effect no different from that of the Fifteenth Amendment itself.\" 446 U.S. at 61, 100 S.Ct. 1490.</p>\n<p>[21]  We need not reach the question of whether this amendment was meant to reach other types of § 2 claims than vote dilution claims; even if so, the amendments were not meant to create a cause of action against imprisoned felon disenfranchisement laws.</p>\n<p>[22]  The Civic Participation and Rehabilitation Act would have restored the voting rights of ex-felons, but not imprisoned felons, in federal elections. H.R. 906 was not drafted as an amendment to the VRA, but contained a savings clause clarifying that the measure operated in addition the VRA and the National Voter Registration Act. <i>Civic Participation and Rehabilitation Act of 1999: Hearing on H.R. 906, supra,</i> at 4. A number of recent unsuccessful bills are consistent with H.R. 906's proposal to restore the rights of only <i>former</i> felons. And even these have been flatly rejected by Congress. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Democracy Restoration Act of 2008, S. 3640, 110th Cong. (2008); Democracy Restoration Act of 2008, H.R. 7136, 110th Cong. (2008); Count Every Vote Act of 2005, S. 450, 109th Cong. (2005); Ex-Offenders Voting Rights Act of 2005, H.R. 663, 109th Cong. (2005).</p>\n<p>[23]  It is doubtful plaintiffs have articulated a viable § 2 direct denial theory, in any event. Plaintiffs have explained only that they think this claim falls within a broad reading of § 2, provided one ignores the text of § 4, the legislative history of the Act, and the purpose and context of § 2(b). But they have not explained even what their theory of liability is, what standards a court would apply, or what the components of a winning claim would be. This is the situation eight years after they filed suit and have had discovery from defendants.\n</p>\n<p>The most plaintiffs have suggested is that despite the self-evident racial neutrality of depriving all incarcerated felons from voting while imprisoned, there may be some causal connection between being incarcerated for felonies and their race. But the very 1994 Commission Report on which they rely concludes that no such connection was shown. More than that, it concluded that if one wished to see if such a connection could be shown, the data simply did not exist to permit the testing of the hypothesis. When plaintiffs asked the defendant officials in discovery for data which would presumably assist them, the defendants said they did not have and did not keep such data.</p>\n<p>There is nothing else. Even if one were to look more broadly at the Senate factors so often used in vote dilution cases, <i>see</i> S.Rep. No. 97-417, at 28-29 (1982), <i>reprinted in</i> 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 177, 206-07, those factors do not aid plaintiffs.</p>\n<p>Further, given our disposition of the case, we need not reach the concerns raised by Judge Kozinski about the role of evidence of statistical disparities in § 2 challenges. <i>Farrakhan,</i> 359 F.3d at 1119 (Kozinski, J. dissenting from denial of reh'g en banc); <i>see also </i><i>Ricci v. DeStefano,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 2658, 2678, 174 L.Ed.2d 490 (2009) (reliance on threshold showing of a raw statistical disparity in test results is not strong evidence of disparate impact).</p>\n<p>[24]  Some have commented on a \"potential tension in the case law [because] ... section 2 [from 1982 onward] had been used almost entirely for vote dilution claims [while] [t]he felon disenfranchisement cases involve an older kind of claim involving access to the ballot itself; such cases involve not vote dilution but vote denial.\" S. Issacharoff et al., <i>The Law of Democracy</i> 140 (rev.2d ed. Supp. 2006); <i>see</i> Tokaji, <i>supra,</i> at 709 (\"While <i>Gingles</i> and its progeny have generated a well-established standard for vote dilution, a satisfactory test for vote denial cases under Section 2 has yet to emerge .... [and] the Supreme Court's seminal opinion in <i>Gingles</i> ... is of little use in vote denial cases.\"); Karlan, <i>supra,</i> at 122 ([\"T]he second generation of voting rights activity address the problem of racial vote dilution rather than outright disenfranchisement.\"); A.A.

No. 94-417, at 29 (1982), <i>as reprinted in</i> 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 177, 207. The ultimate inquiry, according to the Senate Report is \"whether, in the particular situation, the practice operated to deny the minority plaintiff an equal opportunity to participate and to elect candidates of their [sic] choice.\" <i>Id.</i> at 30. The Ninth Circuit, applying this test, has explicitly held that evidence of racial bias in the criminal justice system is a relevant \"social and historical condition\" for purposes of the totality of the circumstances test, reasoning that \"such discrimination would clearly hinder the ability of racial minorities to participate effectively in the political process as disenfranchisement is automatic.\" <i>Farrakhan,</i> 338 F.3d at 1020; <i>see also </i><i>Nipper v. Smith,</i> 39 F.3d 1494, 1513-14 (11th Cir. 1994) (en banc) (holding that the existence of racial bias in the community is relevant to a § 2 claim). \"Thus, racial bias in the criminal justice system may very well interact with voter disqualifications to create the kinds of barriers to political participation on account of race that are prohibited by Section 2.\" <i>Farrakhan,</i> 338 F.3d at 1020.</p>\n<p>[27]  Notably, bearing on the question of plausibility of plaintiffs' claim, one scholar has found that an analysis of the factors inducing states to impose or eliminate felon disenfranchisement provisions concluded that \"[s]tates with greater nonwhite prison populations have been more likely to ban convicted felons from voting than states with proportionally fewer non-whites in the criminal justice system.\" Angela Behrens, et al., <i>Ballot Manipulation and the \"Menace of Negro Domination\": Racial Threat and Felon Disenfranchisement in the United States,</i> 1850-2002, 109 Am. J. Soc. 559, 596 (2003).</p>\n<p>[28]  The majority attempts to distinguish <i>Farrakhan</i> on the ground that the Washington provision at issue in that case was \"not as narrow as this one.\" I, however, see no meaningful difference between disenfranchising felons until the completion of their sentences as under the Washington statute, or only while incarcerated, as in the case before us. In any event, the narrowness or breadth of a particular felon disenfranchisement scheme bears <i>no relevance</i> upon the question of whether challenges to these types of laws are cognizable under the VRA.</p>\n<p>[29]  We acknowledge that § 2(b) of the VRA, containing a \"totality of the circumstances\" test for proving a violation of § 2(a), may require further interpretation. However, any ambiguity in § 2(b) is irrelevant to whether a felon disenfranchisement provision is a voting qualification governed by the Acta question which the plain language of § 2(a) unambiguously answers in the affirmative. <i>See </i><i>Robinson,</i> 519 U.S. at 340, 117 S.Ct. 843 (identifying the relevant question as \"whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning <i>with regard to the particular dispute in the case.</i>\" (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>[30]  Notably, despite its insistence on resorting to secondary sources to ascertain congressional intent, the majority places curiously little emphasis on the historical and policy considerations that prompted Congress to pass into law the very statute whose meaning it endeavors to ascertain.</p>\n<p>[31]  Indicative of Congress's intent to give this prophylactic statute the broadest possible scope, it is notable that an earlier draft of § 2(a) used the slightly narrower language \"qualification or procedure,\" but during Senate Hearings on the bill, one Senator expressed concern that the word `procedure' was not broad enough to cover all the various practices that might effectively be employed to deny citizens their right to vote. <i>See </i><i>Allen,</i> 393 U.S. at 566-67 &amp; n. 8, 89 S.Ct. 817 (citing legislative history). In response, the Attorney General said he had no objection to expanding the language of the section, to be all-inclusive. <i>Id.</i> Congress then expanded the language in the final version of § 2 to include any \"`voting qualifications or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 1973 (1964)).</p>\n<p>[32]  In fact, in his concurrence in <i>Holder v. Hall,</i> Justice Thomas acknowledged that § 2 of the VRA was broadly phrased \"with an eye to eliminating the possibility of evasion.\" 512 U.S. 874, 917, 114 S.Ct. 2581, 129 L.Ed.2d 687 (1994) (Thomas, J., Concurring). Although Justice Thomas argued for a more restrictive interpretation of the scope of § 2 than the majority of the Supreme Court had recognized, his <i>more restrictive</i> interpretation of the provision was as follows:\n</p>\n<p>[T]he specific items described in § 2(a) ... indicate that Congress was concerned in this section with <i>any procedure, however it might be denominated, that regulates citizens' access to the ballot</i>that is, any procedure that might erect a barrier to prevent the potential voter from casting his vote.</p>\n<p><i>Id.</i> (emphasis added). Surely, felon disenfranchisement laws, which outright bar a segment of the population from voting, fall into this expansive category.</p>\n<p>[33]  <i>See also</i> George Brooks, Comment, <i>Felon Disenfranchisement: Law, History, Policy and Politics,</i> 32 Fordham Urb. L.J. 851, 858 (2005) (noting that \"[f]elon disenfranchisement was sometimes used as a tool by the states to disenfranchise blacks\" and citing examples of states passing laws \"disenfranchising those convicted of what were considered to be `black' crimes, while those convicted of `white' crimes did not lose their right to vote\"); Virginia E. Hench, <i>The Death of Voting Rights: The Legal Disenfranchisement of Minority Voters,</i> 48 Case W. Res. L.Rev. 727, 738 (1998) (describing how, during Reconstruction, in an effort to prevent African-Americans from voting, several states enacted felon disenfranchisement laws and \"carefully selected disenfranchising crimes in order to disqualify a disproportionate number of black voters\" and noting that \"many of today's laws disenfranchising felons can trace their roots to attempts by Reconstruction constitutional conventions to enact laws that would keep black voters out of the electoral process\").</p>\n<p>[34]  <i>See, e.g.,</i> Shapiro, <i>supra,</i> at 543; Brooks, <i>supra,</i> at 858; Hench, <i>supra,</i> at 738.</p>\n<p>[35]  In relevant part, that provision states as follows:\n</p>\n<p>Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers,.... But when the right to vote ... is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion, or other crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.</p>\n<p>U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 2.</p>\n<p>[36]  In fact, the majority's contrary interpretation of § 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment, i.e. that felon disenfranchisement is constitutionally protected and cannot be restricted, would result in a direct conflict between constitutional directives in that it is well-established that a felon disenfranchisement statute <i>intended</i> to discriminate against minorities are prohibited under § 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment. <i>See </i><i>Hunter v. Underwood,</i> 471 U.S. 222, 229, 105 S.Ct. 1916, 85 L.Ed.2d 222 (1985) (holding Alabama's disenfranchisement for commission of petty crime or misdemeanor provision unconstitutional). The only reading of § 2 that respects the validity of <i>Hunter</i> and similar precedent is one that permits states to disenfranchise felons only where federal law does not otherwise preclude them from doing so.</p>\n<p>[37]  While this rule, known as the <i>expressio unius est exclusio alterius</i> canon of construction, <i>see </i><i>Councilman,</i> 418 F.3d at 73-74, is useful for evaluating the import of omissions and inclusions in statutory text, I believe its principle is equally persuasive with respect to express omissions and inclusions in the legislative history of a statute.</p>\n<p>[38]  <i>See</i> Gabriel J. Chin, <i>Are Collateral Sanctions Premised on Conduct or Conviction?,</i> 30 Fordham Urb. L.J. 1685, 1686 (2003) (opining that \"it is not always clear that the primary legislative motivation for a collateral sanction is civil rather than punitive, nor is it always a simple matter to discern the primary motivation\").</p>\n<p>[39]  For an example of the kind of clear language \"express[ing] the objective of [a] law in the statutory text itself,\" <i>see </i><i>Smith,</i> 538 U.S. at 93, 123 S.Ct. 1140 (citing the Alaska Legislature's public safety interest in \"protecting the public from sex offenders\" as the basis for its sex offender registration provision).</p>\n<p>[40]  It is surprising that, given its extensive reliance on statements in the legislative history to analyze the clear statutory language of the VRA, the majority only mentions legislative history briefly in its Ex Post Facto Clause analysis, even though the language and structure of Article 120 is <i>actually</i> ambiguous as to whether Article 120 was intended to be punitive or regulatory. While the majority states that it will consider certain comments made by Governor Cellucci, it never analyzes these or other comments by Article 120's proponents relevant to the legislative history of the provision.</p>\n<p>[41]  The legislative process resulting in the passage of Article 120 is worth noting. A constitutional amendment initiated by a legislator must be approved by two successive joint sessions of the Massachusetts legislature and then ratified by Massachusetts voters. Commonwealth Mass. Const. Art. 49, Init., pt. IV, §§ 2-5.</p>\n<p>[42]  I agree with the majority that, even though earlier proposals for felon disenfranchisement laws did not pass, their legislative histories are relevant here. These earlier proposals are nearly identical to Article 120, so the motivation for them is relevant evidence for the motivation behind Article 120. <i>See </i><i>Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez,</i> 372 U.S. 144, 180, 83 S.Ct. 554, 9 L.Ed.2d 644 (1963) (using the legislative history of earlier legislation when assessing the motivation of a law \"quite obviously patterned on that of its predecessor\").</p>\n<p>[43]  <i>See </i><i>Romer v. Evans,</i> 517 U.S. 620, 634, 116 S.Ct. 1620, 134 L.Ed.2d 855 (1996) (holding that the decision of the Court in <i>Davis v. Beason,</i> 133 U.S. 333, 10 S.Ct. 299, 33 L.Ed. 637 (1890), which upheld the disenfranchisement of polygamists on grounds that they advocate \"practical resistance to the laws of the Territory\" and \"approve the commission of crimes forbidden by it\" is \"no longer good law\" because \"persons advocating a certain practice may [not] be denied the right to vote\"). <i>Murphy v. Ramsey,</i> 114 U.S. 15, 5 S.Ct. 747, 29 L.Ed. 47 (1885), involved a suit similar to <i>Davis</i> in which the Supreme Court upheld a voting qualification disqualifying any \"polygamist, bigamist, or any person cohabiting with more than one woman ...\" from voting in Utah. <i>Id.</i> at 38, 42-43, 5 S.Ct. 747. Though <i>Murphy</i> was not expressly overruled by name, as was <i>Davis</i> in <i>Romer,</i> it is evident, given the similarity between the <i>Davis</i> and <i>Murphy</i> challenges, that neither decision continues to represent valid law. The rejection of this line of cases suggests that keeping \"undesirable\" persons, including felons, from voting is no longer a valid regulatory purpose.</p>\n<p>[44]  <i>See </i><i>Werme v. Merrill,</i> 84 F.3d 479, 482 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"It is apodictic that the right to vote is a right that helps to preserve all other rights.\").</p>\n<p>[45]  <i>See also</i> Wilkins, <i>supra,</i> at 133 &amp; n. 316 (noting that in his history of American suffrage, Alexander Keyssar characterized felon disenfranchisement laws as intentionally punitive, noting that \"disenfranchisement, whether permanent or for an extended period, serves as retribution for committing a crime and as a deterrent to future criminal behavior\").</p>\n<p>[46]  That some of Article 120's proponents considered this possibility is evident from statements such as that of Governor Celucci in his letter in support of the disenfranchisement amendment:\n</p>\n<p>The time has come to tell <i>would be</i> criminals in Massachusetts that committing crimes has serious consequences, not only in terms of prison time, but also in terms of the right to participate in deciding how society should be run.</p>\n<p>(Emphasis added).

Shortly thereafter, the state legislature extended this disqualification by statute, Chapter 150, to prevent inmates from voting in all Massachusetts elections.</p>\n<p>In 2001, several incarcerated felons in state custody, challenged these provisions (collectively \"Article 120\") by suing the Secretary of the Commonwealth in federal court. This appeal concerns two of their claims: (1) that the Commonwealth's disenfranchisement provisions violated the Voting Rights Act (\"VRA\") § 2, 42 U.S.C. § 1973, because the percentage of imprisoned felons who are Hispanic or African-American is higher than the percentages of those groups in the population of the state; and (2) that the provisions violated the Ex Post Facto Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, § 10, as to those inmates who were not disqualified from voting before the these provisions took effect. As to their claim under the VRA, the plaintiffs make no allegation of any intentional discrimination or of any history by Massachusetts of intentional discrimination against minority voters. All they have claimed is that past practices in the Massachusetts criminal justice system produced inmate populations which, in combination with the disqualification of inmates imprisoned for felonies, have resulted in disproportionate disqualification of minorities from voting. Theirs is a claim of disparate impact.</p>\n<p>After allowing initial discovery, the district court in 2007 denied the Commonwealth's motion for entry of judgment on the pleadings on plaintiffs' VRA claim but granted the Commonwealth's motion for summary judgment on the Ex Post Facto Clause argument.</p>\n<p>We think it clear from the language, history, and context of the VRA that Congress never intended § 2 to prohibit the states from disenfranchising currently incarcerated felons. We do not say that direct vote denial claims of other types may not be brought under § 2, only that no VRA claim is stated against a state law which disenfranchises incarcerated felons. We reverse and order the dismissal of the VRA § 2 claim. We affirm the grant of summary judgment on the Ex Post Facto claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Enactment of the Massachusetts Incarcerated Felon Disenfranchisement Provisions</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Before Article 120 was enacted, prisoners were able to vote by absentee ballot. In 1997, there was an unsuccessful proposal for legislation to disenfranchise currently <span class=\"star-pagination\">*27</span> incarcerated persons for certain felonies: murder, rape, other sex-related offenses, and controlled substances offenses. Massachusetts prisoners responded by forming a political action committee (\"PAC\"), aimed at influencing criminal justice issues, including sentencing, prison reform, and \"Draconian laws on punishment.\" PACs, inter alia, raise money for and endorse candidates.</p>\n<p>State elected officials reacted swiftly. On August 12, 1997, then-Acting Governor Cellucci proposed a constitutional amendment that would disenfranchise all incarcerated individuals (not just felons), saying:</p>\n<blockquote>Criminals behind bars have no business deciding who should govern the law-abiding citizens of the Commonwealth. This proposed amendment will ensure that criminals pay their debt to society before they regain their right to participate in the political process.</blockquote>\n<p>The legislature did not act on this proposal. Rather, the legislature approved a different proposed amendment that would disenfranchise only those currently incarcerated for felonies. Lawmakers received the legal opinions of House and Senate Counsel that such an alternative amendment would be constitutional under the U.S. Constitution.</p>\n<p>Article 120, the proposed amendment to Article 3 of the Amendments to the state constitution, was presented to the voters along with an Information for Voters Guide. That Guide constitutes relevant legislative history. The Guide included 150-word arguments written by proponents and opponents of each ballot question. The statement from the proponents stated, \"A yes vote prevents criminals serving time for a felony conviction from voting in Massachusetts's elections while in jail.\" The proponents argued:</p>\n<blockquote>When someone in Massachusetts is sentenced to jail for committing a felony, we deprive them of their liberty and right to exercise control over their own lives, yet current law allows these same criminals to continue to exercise control over our lives by voting from prison. This amendment will change the law that gives jailed criminals the right to vote.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Massachusetts is one of only three states in our nation where felons serving time may vote while in jail. Voting yes on this important question will make the Commonwealth the 48th state to prohibit the practice of allowing convicted criminals to vote from jail. This change discriminates against no one except jailed criminals.</blockquote>\n<p>The Guide also contained the opponents' argument:</p>\n<blockquote>The Constitution of Massachusetts is clear on this point: Citizens retain their right to vote even while incarcerated. The founders of Massachusetts intended this right, and our Supreme Judicial Court affirmed in in 1977. In the history of the Commonwealth, we have never amended our Constitution in order to narrow fundamental rights. There is no reason to do so now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>No one has alleged that prisoner voting has harmed our democracy or social fabric. Very few prisoners vote, and no one claims that prisoner voting has negatively influenced any election. Stripping incarcerated felons of their right to vote serves no public safety function. It will not deter crime, repair the harm done by crime, nor help to rehabilitate prisoners.</blockquote>\n<p>The voters approved the amendment with 60.3% voting \"yes\" to 33.9% voting \"no,\" and 5.8% of voters not casting a vote on the question. The amendment took effect on December 6, 2000. Article 3 now reads:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*28</span> Every citizen of eighteen years of age and upwards, <i>excepting persons who are incarcerated in a correctional facility due to a felony conviction,</i> and excepting persons under guardianship and persons temporarily or permanently disqualified by law because of corrupt practices in respect to elections who shall have resided within the town or district in which he may claim a right to vote, six calendar months next preceding any election of governor, lieutenant governor, senators or representatives, shall have a right to vote in such election of governor, lieutenant governor, senators and representatives; and no other person shall be entitled to vote in such election.</blockquote>\n<p>Mass. Const. amend. art. 3 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>The Massachusetts legislature then enacted Chapter 150 of the Acts of 2001, which effectuated Article 120 by broadening the ban on felon voting to cover all Massachusetts elections and by changing the statutory requirements for obtaining absentee ballots. Chapter 150 took effect November 27, 2001. Unlike many other states, Massachusetts does not disqualify convicted felons from voting once they are released from prison.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Procedural History of the Litigation</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs Paul Simmons, an African-American, Pedro Valentin, a Hispanic-American, and Dennis J. Beldotti, a Caucasian-American, are Massachusetts residents currently in the custody of the Massachusetts Department of Correction for felonies they committed on or before December 5, 2000. Plaintiffs were eligible to be Massachusetts voters before that date, but the record does not reveal whether they were registered to vote.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs' pro se complaint was amended twice by court-appointed counsel. Their final amended complaint alleged that Article 120 violates § 2 of the VRA because it has a \"disproportionately adverse effect on the voting rights of African-Americans and Hispanic Americans compared to its effect on the voting rights of other citizens.\" This effect \"is caused by, among other things, the facts that African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans are over-represented in the population of Massachusetts incarcerated felons, and that there exists considerable racial and ethnic bias, both direct and subtle, in the Massachusetts court system.\"<sup>[1]</sup> Article 120, plaintiffs contended, \"interact[s] with social and historical conditions to cause an inequality in the opportunities enjoyed by minority and non-minority voters to elect their preferred representatives.\"</p>\n<p>In describing plaintiffs' complaint, which alleges a \"vote denial\" claim, we distinguish vote denial cases from vote dilution<sup>[2]</sup> claims under § 2 of the VRA. The Supreme <span class=\"star-pagination\">*29</span> Court first articulated the distinction in explaining that \"[t]he right to vote can be affected by a <i>dilution</i> of voting power as well as by an absolute prohibition on casting a ballot.\" <i>Shaw v.

Tokaji, <i>The New Vote Denial: Where Election Reform Meets the Voting Rights Act,</i> 57 S.C. L.Rev. 689, 691 (2006). Vote denial cases challenge practices such as literacy tests, poll taxes, white primaries, and English-only ballots. <i>Id.</i> By contrast, vote dilution challenges involve \"practices that diminish minorities' political influence,\" such as at-large elections and redistricting plans that either weaken or keep minorities' voting strength weak. <i>Id.; see also</i> P.S. Karlan, <i>The Impact of the Voting Rights Act on African Americans, in Voting Rights and Redistricting</i> 121, 122 (M.E. Rush ed., 1998).</p>\n<p>To be clear, plaintiffs did not allege and have disavowed making a § 2 vote dilution claim, such as that the votes of African-Americans and Hispanics who are not imprisoned for felonies have been diluted by Article 120. This case also does not involve any claim that generalized rules or practices governing the administration of elections have resulted in a disproportionate denial of votes of minorities. Further, plaintiffs have not asserted that the state has otherwise created barriers to the election of minority group members or other participation of minorities in the political process. Finally, the plaintiffs' complaint made no allegation that the Commonwealth acted with racially discriminatory intent or purpose in enacting Article 120, and plaintiffs have specifically disavowed any such claim. This is a claim based purely on the allegation that Article 120 has a disparate impact on minorities by disqualifying from voting imprisoned felons.</p>\n<p>In support of their pleadings, the complaint referred to and appended a 1994 Final Report by the Commission to Study Racial and Ethnic Bias in the Courts to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\").<sup>[3]</sup> Plaintiffs alleged the legislators were aware of or should have been aware of the conclusions in that 1994 Report. That 1994 Report, however, was not referenced in or part of the Voters Guide, and there is no claim the voters were aware of it.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs further alleged that Article 120 is punitive in purpose and effect and therefore violates the Ex Post Facto Clause as to those inmates who committed their offenses before the disenfranchisement measures took effect.</p>\n<p>The relief sought was a declaration that Article 120 was unconstitutional under the Ex Post Facto Clause and illegal under § 2 of the VRA, injunctive relief, and costs and attorneys' fees.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*30</span> Plaintiffs unsuccessfully moved for a preliminary injunction; defendant opposed, filing affidavits which described the legislative history of Article 120 and the ratification process. The parties conducted written discovery.<sup>[4]</sup> Defendant then moved for summary judgment as to the Ex Post Facto and equal protection claims and for judgment on the pleadings as to the VRA § 2 claim on January 12, 2007. The plaintiffs opposed the Commonwealth's motions and also cross-moved for summary judgment as to the Ex Post Facto and equal protection claims.</p>\n<p>On August 30, 2007, the district court granted the Commonwealth's motion for summary judgment on the Ex Post Facto Clause claim and the equal protection claim and denied plaintiffs' cross-motion. The court denied the Commonwealth's motion on the VRA claim. On January 16, 2008, the district court certified its order on the VRA claim for interlocutory appeal. Plaintiffs petitioned to cross-appeal on the Ex Post Facto and equal protection claims. This court granted leave to appeal all three claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b). Plaintiffs have abandoned the Equal Protection Clause claim and contest only the Ex Post Facto Clause ruling, and the Commonwealth appeals the denial of its motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the VRA § 2 claims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Standard of Review</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Our review of the court's ruling on both claims is de novo, and we take the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs. <i>Estate of Bennett v.

Article 120 is among the narrowest of state felon disenfranchisement <span class=\"star-pagination\">*31</span> provisions.<sup>[6]</sup> Only two states permit incarcerated felons to vote, and Massachusetts is one of thirteen jurisdictions that limit disenfranchisement to the period of incarceration. Currently, thirty-five states prevent felons from voting during the period of their parole or probation or both. Eleven states disenfranchise felons beyond the term of their incarceration, probation, and parole. Two states disenfranchise felons for life.</p>\n<p>The question of state felon disenfranchisement laws and the VRA § 2 has been addressed by five circuits. Four circuits, including two en banc, have rejected § 2 challenges to broader disqualifications; one panel in the Ninth Circuit had allowed such a § 2 challenge to go forward, although it was ultimately unsuccessful. The Second Circuit, consistent with our holding here, has rejected a § 2 challenge to a state statute disenfranchising prisoners, as well as parolees. <i>Hayden v.

Bd. of Elections,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"276628\"><a href=\"/opinion/276628/gilbert-green-v-board-of-elections-of-the-city-of-new-york-louis-j/\"><span class=\"volume\">380</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span>, 451 (2d Cir.1967).<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>Here, the Commonwealth enacted this prohibition after prisoners attempted to organize to change the laws under which they were convicted, sentenced, and imprisoned. The state has a strong interest in setting its own qualifications for voters, a strong interest in the integrity of its system of enforcing and administering its criminal laws, and a strong interest in how its correctional systems are maintained and run. <i>Preiser v.

The Massachusetts provision, it is important to note, is narrowly tailored. Because the disqualification is confined to currently imprisoned felons, the state interests it serves are clearly at their strongest.</p>\n<p>Further, Article 120 of the Massachusetts constitution does not raise issues about a history of laws in Massachusetts, including felon disenfranchisement laws, that were used deliberately to impede voting by minorities. Such historical concerns about practices in other states have been the subject of academic commentary. <i>See, e.g.,</i> G. Brooks, Comment, <i>Felon Disenfranchisement: Law, History, Policy and Politics,</i> 32 Fordham Urb. L.J. 851, 858-59 (2005) (concluding that the VRA does not reach state felon disenfranchisement laws). Plaintiffs have made no claim that Massachusetts has historically ever used any tests or devices to discourage minority voting or minority candidates. Nor is there any claim that Massachusetts has defined Article 120 disenfranchisement in terms of felonies that have higher conviction rates for minorities than for whites. <i>Cf. </i><i>Hunter,</i> 471 U.S. at 229, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111413\"><a href=\"/opinion/111413/hunter-v-underwood/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The amendment of § 2 also made clear that an abridgement or denial could be identified \"as provided in subsection (b),\" which was added by the 1982 amendments.</p>\n<p>To start, it is clear that under the plain terms of the statute, not every \"voter qualification\" is actionable under § 2. For § 2 to apply, the burden is on the plaintiffs to make other showings, including that the qualification \"results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.\" § 1973(a); <i>see also </i><i>Metts v. Murphy,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">363</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></span>, 12 (1st Cir.2004) (en banc) (per curiam).</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs' theory of how they meet this burden under § 2 is that from the very enactment of § 2 in 1965, the broad language of § 2 has created a cause of action on these facts. Article 120, they contend, is obviously a voter disqualification and the disqualification results in a denial of the right to vote \"on account of race\" because the percentages of incarcerated felons who are black or Hispanic are higher than those two groups in the population as a whole.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs argue the language of § 2(a) is so clear it stands alone and that rules of statutory construction prohibit consideration of the history or context of § 2.<sup>[9]</sup> Plaintiffs' claim assumes that felon disenfranchisement laws are not different from and should be treated like any other voting qualification under § 2. That assumption is a fatal flaw in their case. Felon disenfranchisement statutes are not like all other voting qualifications. Congress has treated such laws differently. They are deeply rooted in our history, in our laws, and in our Constitution. We conclude Congress did not intend § 2 to provide a cause of action against Article 120.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*35</span> As a matter of textual analysis, it is neither plain nor clear that plaintiffs' claim fits within the text of § 2(a). For example, it is logical to understand the state law disenfranchisement of incarcerated felons as not \"resulting\" in a denial \"on account of race or color\" but on account of imprisonment for a felony, and thus not within the text of § 2 at all.<sup>[10]</sup> We agree with the Second Circuit that the language of § 2(a) is both broad and ambiguous and that judicial interpretation of a claim concerning felon disenfranchisement under the VRA may not be limited to the text of § 2(a) alone. <i>See </i><i>Hayden,</i> 449 F.3d at 315 (citing <i>Watt v.

The purposes and congressional history of the 1982 amendments, as well as congressional action after 1982, further confirm our understanding that § 2 does not encompass this claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>The Original VRA of 1965</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The original VRA was enacted against the background of explicit constitutional and congressional<sup>[11]</sup> approval of state felon disenfranchisement laws and expressed no intention to invalidate such laws, but rather an intention to leave such laws untouched.</p>\n<p>Prior to the enactment of the VRA, enforcement of the Fifteenth Amendment guarantee that the \"right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged ... on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude,\" U.S. Const. amend.

The VRA's original object was plainly to combat specific forms of racial discrimination.<sup>[12]</sup> Beyond § 2, the remainder of the VRA set up a scheme of stringent remedies to address the most flagrant practices. \"[T]he Act directly pre-empted the most powerful tools of black disenfranchisement in the covered areas. All literacy tests and similar voting qualifications were abolished by § 4 of the Act.\" <i>Nw. Austin,</i> 129 S.Ct. at *2509, (citing Voting Rights Act of 1965, §§ 4(a)-(d), 79 Stat. 437, 438-439).</p>\n<p>The legislative history of the VRA shows that Congress was not silent with respect to felon disenfranchisement laws. In fact, Congress explicitly considered the effect of the VRA on state felon disenfranchisement laws, and did so under § 4, rather than under § 2.<sup>[13]</sup> Section 4 of the VRA bans any \"test or device\" that impermissibly limits the franchise. 42 U.S.C. § 1973b(c). Congress, in enacting § 4(c) proscribed several categories of historically discriminatory tests or devices, including some literacy tests, educational achievement or knowledge tests, and good moral character qualifications. But Congress was careful to carve out from its proscription of tests for good moral character any and all state <span class=\"star-pagination\">*37</span> felon disenfranchisement laws. H.R.Rep. No. 89-439 (1965), <i>reprinted in</i> 1965 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2437, 2547-57. In excluding felon disenfranchisement laws from the scope of § 4, Congress took the view that it did not consider such laws to be a discriminatory voter qualification or a \"tool[] of black disenfranchisement.\" <i>Nw. Austin,</i> 129 S.Ct. at *2509.</p>\n<p>The Senate Judiciary Committee Report explicitly stated that this § 4 prohibition on tests and devices \"would not result in the proscription of the frequent requirement of States and political subdivisions that an applicant for voting or registration for voting be free of conviction of a felony or mental disability.\" S.Rep. No. 89-162 (1965), <i>reprinted in</i> 1965 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2508, 2562 (joint views of Senators Dodd, Hart, Long, Kennedy, Bayh, Burdick, Tydings, Dirksen, Hruska, Fong, Scott, and Javits).</p>\n<p>The House Report confirms the Senate's understanding. It stated that the VRA \"does not proscribe a requirement of a State or any political subdivision of a State that an applicant for voting or registration for voting be free of conviction of a felony or mental disability.\" H.R.Rep. No. 89-439, <i>reprinted in</i> 1965 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2457.</p>\n<p>In drafting the VRA, Congress considered felon disenfranchisement statutes, and it viewed them as a potential test or device that fell within the purview of § 4 and not § 2. We are not free to second guess Congress's categorizations of felon disenfranchisement statutes. Further, Congress made clear that it did not purport to outlaw state felon disenfranchisement statutes based on their effect. Rather, under § 4, Congress enumerated and outlawed tests or devices it viewed as disqualifications excluding minority voters. Felon disenfranchisement laws were specifically removed from this category by Congress and were considered nondiscriminatory.</p>\n<p>In light of this express history, Congress could not have intended to create a cause of action under § 2 of the VRA against disenfranchisement of incarcerated felons while saying explicitly elsewhere that it did not intend to proscribe any such laws. Other courts agree with our conclusion. <i>Hayden,</i> 449 F.3d at 319 (\"[I]t is apparent to us that Congress's effort to highlight the exclusion of felon disenfranchisement laws from a VRA provision that otherwise would likely be read to invalidate such laws is indicative of its broader intention to exclude such laws from the reach of the statute.\"); <i>see also </i><i>Farrakhan,</i> 359 F.3d at 1120-21 (Kozinski, J., dissenting from denial of reh'g en banc).</p>\n<p>This point is buttressed by another aspect of § 4. As drafted in 1965, § 4 applied to covered jurisdictions.<sup>[14]</sup> Congress would not have permitted felon disenfranchisement laws in covered jurisdictions where there was a history of discrimination, while prohibiting them in non-covered jurisdictions like Massachusetts. To subject felon disenfranchisement in a non-covered jurisdiction to a VRA cause of action while prohibiting such a cause of action for a covered jurisdiction would itself raise significant <span class=\"star-pagination\">*38</span> constitutional concerns. <i>See Nw. Austin,</i> 129 S.Ct. at *2513.</p>\n<p>If there were any doubt as to Congress's intent not to create a cause of action against laws like Article 120, other actions show congressional acceptance of even broader felon disenfranchisement laws than involved here, reinforcing the conclusion that § 2 was not meant to proscribe laws such as Article 120. In 1971, just six years after passing the VRA, Congress affirmatively enacted a broader felon disenfranchisement statute covering both imprisoned and paroled felons in the District of Columbia, over which it then exercised plenary power. Act of Dec. 23, 1971, Pub.L. No. 92-220, § 4, 85 Stat. 788, 788; <i>see also </i><i>Hayden,</i> 449 F.3d at 315. Congress would not have prohibited states from imposing such disqualifications when it imposed them itself on the District.</p>\n<p>Further, between the passage of the VRA in 1965 and the 1982 amendments, Congress considered and rejected proposals to amend the VRA<sup>[15]</sup> to prohibit certain types of state felon disenfranchisement laws. Congress understood that the VRA, as enacted in 1965, did not permit claims against state felon disenfranchisement laws and that amendment of the VRA would be needed to permit such suits, and it declined to make those amendments. Two points are important. First, Congress rejected each those proposed amendments. Second, even those rejected amendments would have precluded suits raising claims of disenfranchisement of a \"citizen [who] is confined in a correctional facility at the time of such ... election,\" as does Article 120 now at issue. <i>See Ex-Offenders Voting Rights: Hearing on H.R. 9020 Before the Subcomm. on Courts, Civil Liberties, and the Administration of Justice of the H. Comm. on the Judiciary,</i> 93d Cong. 4 (1974).</p>\n<p>In 1972, the House Judiciary Committee held hearings on \"The Problems of the Ex-Offender.\" <i>See Corrections, Part VI, Illinois: The Problems of the Ex-Offender: Hearing Before Subcomm. No. 3 of the H. Comm. on the Judiciary,</i> 92d Cong. (1972). In response to these hearings, several prominent VRA advocates in Congress jointly introduced a bill designed \"to amend the [VRA] to prohibit the States from denying the right to vote in Federal elections to <i>former</i> criminal offenders who have not been convicted of any offense related to voting or elections <i>and who are not confined in a correctional institution.</i>\" <i>Hayden,</i> 449 F.3d at 319 (emphasis added) (quoting H.R. 15,049, 92d Cong.

We explain. Prior to <i>Bolden,</i> in <i>White v. Regester,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108826\"><a href=\"/opinion/108826/white-v-regester/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">755</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108826\"><a href=\"/opinion/108826/white-v-regester/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></a></span> (1973), minority plaintiffs had successfully challenged a state districting plan on vote dilution grounds. There, the Court did not require a showing of discriminatory intent. <i>See id.</i> at 766. By contrast, the <i>Bolden</i> plurality held that state action \"that is racially neutral on its face violates the Fifteenth Amendment only if motivated by a discriminatory purpose,\" 446 U.S. at 61, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110246\"><a href=\"/opinion/110246/mobile-v-bolden/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1490</span></a></span>, and altered the <i>White</i> evidentiary standard in vote dilution cases to require direct evidence of discriminatory intent.<sup>[20]</sup><i>See </i><i>Bartlett,</i> 129 S.Ct. at 1240-41.</p>\n<p>In 1982, Congress focused on reversing this aspect of <i>Bolden</i> and clarifying the standard for vote dilution claims. Congress aimed to reinstate the \"results test,\" which had been the rule developed in the pre-<i>Bolden</i> case law for vote dilution claims under <i>White. See </i><i>Metts,</i> 363 F.3d at 10 (stating the 1982 amendments made it clear that \"discriminatory intent is not a necessary element in a violation and that Congress [instead] intended a broad range of factors to be taken into account\"). But the reinstated, multifactored results test was not meant to extend to this limited felon disenfranchisement claim any more than the pre-<i>Bolden</i> tests were. Nothing in the legislative history of § 2(b) indicated any intent to expand the VRA to create a cause of action against a state felon disenfranchisement law such as Article 120. To the contrary, in enacting § 2, Congress noted that it was impossible to predict the variety of means that would be used to infringe on the right to vote and that the voting rights landscape was marked by innovation in discrimination. S.Rep. No. 89-162, at 5 (1965); S.Rep. No. 89-439, at 10. But these concerns do not go to felon disenfranchisement, which was neither a new innovation nor a predictable future innovation. Felon disenfranchisement was a well-known and accepted part of the voting landscape. \"The Senate Report, which details many discriminatory techniques used by certain jurisdictions, made no mention of felon disenfranchisement provisions.\" <i>Johnson,</i> 405 F.3d at 1234; <i>see also</i> Tokaji, <i>supra,</i> at 707 (\"The legislative history of the 1982 amendments thus shows that Congress was almost exclusively focused on vote dilution claims.\").<sup>[21]</sup></p>\n<p>Further, the language of § 2(b) undercuts plaintiffs' assertion they have stated a claim under § 2(a). The text of subsection (b) protects a \"class of citizens\" who by law may and should enjoy as full an \"opportunity [as] other members of the electorate to participate in the political process.\" § 1973(b). For a host of valid reasons, incarcerated prisoners cannot participate in the political process equally with free citizens outside the prison walls. <i>Hayden,</i> 449 F.3d at 342 (Jacobs, J., concurring). As noted by <i>Hayden,</i> \"There is no question that incarcerated persons cannot <span class=\"star-pagination\">*41</span> `fully participate in the political process'they cannot petition, protest, campaign, travel, freely associate, or raise funds.\" <i>Id.</i> at 321.</p>\n<p>Further, the 1982 Congress amended § 2 to assuage expressed fears that the courts would interpret a results test as a requirement for proportional representation in vote dilution cases, and therefore the statute was amended to expressly disclaim any right to proportional representation. § 1973(b) (\"[N]othing in this section establishes a right to have members of a protected class elected in numbers equal to their proportion in the population.\"); Tokaji, <i>supra,</i> at 705-06. This suggests that Congress was fundamentally concerned with remedying discrimination in voting, rather than guaranteeing proportionality in political representation. <i>See, e.g.,</i> S. Issacharoff, <i>Polarized Voting and the Political Process,</i> 90 Mich. L.Rev. 1833 (1992). Plaintiffs' claim, which is based on mere disproportionality in the prison population from felon disenfranchisement, does not implicate these concerns.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>Post-1982 Congressional Actions Assume the Validity of State and Federal Felon Disenfranchisement Laws</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Congressional action, both after 1982 and in the aftermath of <i>Bush v. Gore</i><i>,</i> also undercuts the plaintiffs' reading of the amended § 2 to support a claim against imprisoned felon disenfranchisement laws. These statutes show continuing congressional approval of state laws disenfranchising imprisoned felons. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993, which generally restricts states' ability to remove names from the voter rolls, explicitly exempts state decisions to disenfranchise individuals \"by reason of criminal conviction.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1973gg-6(a)(3)(B). The Help America Vote Act of 2002 directs states to remove disenfranchised felons from their lists of those eligible to vote in federal elections. 42 U.S.C. § 15483(a)(2)(A)(ii)(I). These two recent statutes are entirely inconsistent with reading § 2, whatever its breadth, to create a cause of action against Article 120.</p>\n<p>Further, Congress has continued to consider and reject numerous proposals to require states to enfranchise even former felons. Even these efforts have expressly excluded currently incarcerated felons. <i>See, e.g., Civic Participation and Rehabilitation Act of 1999: Hearing on H.R. 906 Before the Subcomm. on the Constitution of the H. Comm. on the Judiciary,</i> 106th Cong. 1, 3 (2000) (quoting H.R. 906, 106th Cong. (1999)).<sup>[22]</sup></p>\n<p>Congress has excepted from the reach of the VRA protections from vote denial for claims against a state which disenfranchises incarcerated felons. We do not need to decide<sup>[23]</sup> what is needed to prove a denial <span class=\"star-pagination\">*42</span> (as opposed to a dilution) claim under § 2 which is not a claim against a state provision disenfranchising imprisoned felons.<sup>[24]</sup></p>\n<p>Given the historic legitimacy of felon disenfranchisement, the constitutional recognition of the authority of states to disenfranchise imprisoned felons, the congressional recognition of that authority and the express congressional statements that the VRA was not meant to proscribe that authority, this is not the case in which to test the standards for other types of purported direct disenfranchisement claims. While our emphasis is somewhat different, we agree with the Second Circuit in <i>Hayden</i> that the seven circumstances it identifies all necessitate the conclusion that the this claim is not actionable. 449 F.3d at 315-16.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim under VRA § 2. We have no need to reach the serious constitutional questions which the Commonwealth argues would be raised were we to adopt plaintiffs' construction of the statute. In <i>Northwest Austin,</i> the Supreme Court emphasized the principle that courts, particularly in VRA cases, should avoid deciding constitutional issues where statutory interpretation obviates the issue, as here. <i>Nw. Austin,</i> 129 S.Ct. at *2508 (\"Our usual practice is to avoid the unnecessary resolution of constitutional questions.\"); <i>see also </i><i>Hayden,</i> 449 F.3d at 328 n. 24; <i>Johnson,</i> 405 F.3d at 1230.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>EX POST FACTO CLAUSE CLAIM</i></h2>\n<p>We turn to plaintiffs' appeal from the district court's grant of summary judgment <span class=\"star-pagination\">*43</span> in favor of the Commonwealth on the Ex Post Facto Clause arguments. There are no material facts in dispute in the record.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs argue the Ex Post Facto Clause was violated because \"the only plainly discernible purpose for Article 120 was to seek to impose an additional measure of punishment upon those who had violated the laws of the Commonwealth.\" Plaintiffs point to the a transcript of the debates at the 1998 and 2000 Constitutional Conventions over the bill that ultimately became Article 120. Plaintiffs also rely on language from Acting Governor Cellucci's proposed amendment and his statements to the public, an amendment which was not accepted. These statements include: \"The time has come to tell would-be criminals in Massachusetts that committing crimes has serious consequences,\" and that \"[p]risons are a place for punishment.\" Even though his initial proposal was never in fact acted on by the legislature, we consider his comments as part of the background.</p>\n<p>Analysis of the Ex Post Facto Clause claim involves a two-part inquiry. The first asks whether the denial of the right to vote is a civil, regulatory measure within the meaning of the caselaw, or whether it is punitive. \"[W]here unpleasant consequences are brought to bear upon an individual for prior conduct,\" the central question \"is whether the legislative aim was to punish that individual for past activity, or whether the restriction of the individual comes about as a relevant incident to a regulation of a present situation.\" <i>De Veau v.

If, in the exercise of the power to protect banks, both sanctions were imposed for the purpose of punishing bank robbers, the statutes authorizing both disabilities would be penal.

Article 120 is not in the Commonwealth's criminal code, but rather its civil constitutional and statutory voter qualification provisions. <i>See </i><i>Hendricks,</i> 521 U.S. at 361, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118136\"><a href=\"/opinion/118136/kansas-v-hendricks/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

And the disqualification is enforced civilly, not criminally.</p>\n<p>Article 120 does not involve a more general period of disenfranchisement because of commission of a felony; rather Article 120 is limited to the period of incarceration.

Plaintiffs rely on some statements made by some legislators that could be viewed as retributive, such as that felons \"don't deserve to vote.\" To the extent the legislators' comments are relevant, they are sporadic and do not clearly evince a retributive purpose. More significantly, since Article 120 was put before the voters, the Information for Voters Guide is a better source of context. The Guide contained a balanced debate about the merits of allowing currently incarcerated felons to vote in state elections, noted the problem of prisoners being able to affect the laws under which they were confined by voting, and nowhere suggests an intent to punish prisoners.</p>\n<p>As to the sixth factor, there is an obvious rational nonpunitive purpose for disenfranchisement: as the Guide shows, voters were concerned about the influence of currently incarcerated felons in \"exercis[ing] control over [their] lives by voting from prison.\" <i>See also </i><i>Smith,</i> 123 S.Ct. at 1147 (noting that \"even if the objective of the Act is consistent with the purposes of the [state] criminal justice system, the State's pursuit of it in a regulatory scheme does not make the objective punitive.\").

Plaintiffs allege that this disparate impact is caused, in part, by racial and ethnic bias in the Massachusetts court system, and operates to deny these racial minorities the right to vote, in violation of § 2 of the VRA. Plaintiffs further allege that when enacting Article 120, Massachusetts legislators were aware of the data regarding racial bias in the criminal justice system.<sup>[27]</sup></p>\n<p>The felon disenfranchisement provision at issue is clearly a \"voting qualification.\" Whether or not this provision results in the denial of the right to vote \"on account of race or color\" under the \"totality of the circumstances\" remains the ultimate question for the trier of fact.

Plaintiffs have stated a claim sufficient to preclude dismissal at this preliminary stage and are entitled to the opportunity to develop it.</p>\n<p>In order to avoid this obvious result, the majority makes an expansive and unwarranted holding. It holds that despite the broad language of VRA § 2, covering all \"voting qualifications,\" Congress actually never intended for felon disenfranchisement laws, even discriminatory ones, to be challengeable under that provision. It does so by disregarding the plain and unambiguous text of the statute and resorting to a collection of secondary evidence, none of which stand for the proposition the majority seeks to establish. In the face of so startling a holding, I am left wondering, in the words of Judge Calabresi, \"[w]hat is behind this remarkable decision to buck text, context, and legislative history in order to insulate a particular racially discriminatory practice from an anti-discrimination rule of general applicability?\" <i>Hayden,</i> 449 F.3d at 365 (Calabresi, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>The fatal flaw in the majority's reasoning begins with its improper reliance on legislative history given the plain and unambiguous language of § 2(a), the section of the VRA governing the central \"applicability\" question before us. <i>See </i><i>Robinson</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*48</span> <i>v.

A provision disqualifying incarcerated felons, listed among the provisions of the Massachusetts Constitution governing qualifications to vote, clearly constitutes a \"voting qualification.\" Therefore, where it is alleged, as here, that this \"qualification\" is being applied \"in a manner which results\" in the denial of the right to vote on account of race, a cognizable VRA claim has been stated. <i>Id.</i> As the text of the statute unambiguously manifests its meaning, there was no need to go any further in order to conclude that plaintiffs have stated a cognizable claim under § 2 of the VRA.</p>\n<p>This is the reasoning upon which the Ninth Circuit decision, holding that an identical VRA claim had been stated in that Circuit, starts and ends. <i>See </i><i>Farrakhan,</i> 338 F.3d at 1016 (\"Plaintiff's claim of vote denial [resulting from Washington's felon disenfranchisement law] is cognizable under Section 2 of the VRA because `[f]elon disenfranchisement' is a voting qualification, and Section 2 is clear that <i>any</i> voting qualification that denies citizens the right to vote in a discriminatory manner violates the VRA\" (emphasis added)).<sup>[28]</sup> As Judge Sotomayor similarly explained in her powerful dissenting opinion in <i>Hayden:</i></p>\n<blockquote>It is plain to anyone reading the Voting Rights Act that it applies to all `voting qualifications.'

In any event, if I were to read anything into that silence, I would reach the <i>opposite</i> conclusion. This is because felon disenfranchisement laws, which were undoubtedly among the mechanisms being employed by states throughout the post-reconstruction era to deprive minorities of the vote,<sup>[34]</sup> were inevitably within Congress's contemplation when drafting the VRA. Had Congress had intended to exclude this particular type of qualification from the reach of the statute, it could have done so explicitly. But Congress made no provisos to carve felon disenfranchisement laws out from the purposely \"all inclusive\" language of § 2(a). <i>See </i><i>Allen,</i> 393 U.S. at 566, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In this historical context, congressional silence suggests, if anything, that no such exclusion was intended.</p>\n<p>Moreover, through the 1982 amendments to the VRA, Congress expanded the remedial power of the Act even further by relieving plaintiffs of the burden of proving discriminatory intent.

Congress did so because it recognized the difficulty of proving deliberate and purposeful discrimination, and sought to ensure that \"in the context of all the circumstances in the jurisdiction in question,\" any disparate racial impact of facially neutral voting requirements did not result from racial discrimination. S.Rep. No. 97-417 at 27. This \"results test\" was intended \"to serve as a prophylactic against voting practicessuch as felon disenfranchisement ... adopted or retained due to intentional discrimination that would be difficult to prove in court.\" Daniel P. Tokaji, <i>The New Vote Denial: Where Election Reform Meets the Voting Rights Act,</i> 57 S.C. L.Rev. 689, 722 (2006). And its Report accompanying the enactment of the 1982 amendments, the Senate endorsed statements made by the Attorney General during the original VRA hearings that the purpose of \"Section 2 w[as][to] ban `<i>any kind of practice</i> ...' if its purpose or effect was to deny or abridge the right to vote on account of race or color.\" S.Rep. No. 97-417, at 17 (emphasis added). Given this history, it would be wholly incongruous with Congress's broad ameliorative intent to conclude, as does the majority, that where the particular voter qualification that results in racial discrimination happens to be a felon disenfranchisement law, in this eventuality only, does the VRA provide no relief and permit the discriminatory qualification to persist.</p>\n<p>To reach this unlikely result, the majority relies on assorted evidence of the widespread use and general sanction of felon disenfranchisement laws in various contexts. But all that any of this evidence actually shows is that felon disenfranchisement is not presumptively invalid, a proposition <span class=\"star-pagination\">*53</span> as to which, after <i>Richardson,</i> 418 U.S. at 56, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109083\"><a href=\"/opinion/109083/richardson-v-ramirez/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2655</span></a></span>, there is no doubt. None of the majority's arguments support its conclusion that Congress intended to insulate such laws from scrutiny under § 2 of the VRA where they are alleged to effect a discriminatory result. Specifically, the evidence relied on by the majority includes (1) § 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment, (2) the legislative history of VRA § 4, and (3) Congressional endorsement of felon disenfranchisement generally. I will address each of these sources in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment</h2>\n<p>The majority suggests that felon disenfranchisement somehow differs from other voting qualifications because the \"power of the states to disqualify from voting those convicted of crimes is explicitly set forth in § 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" But, looking at the text of that provision in context, it is by no means a grant of power to states to disenfranchise felons. <i>See</i> U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 2. Rather, that provision simply states that disenfranchised felons, unlike other persons disenfranchised by the States, are to be included within the census for purposes of apportioning representatives.<sup>[35]</sup></p>\n<p>The most that can be gleaned from this language is that by addressing the eventuality of \"abridg[ment] ... for participation in ... crime,\" Congress contemplated that at least in <i>some</i> circumstances, felon disenfranchisement could exist. Thus, it merely implies that there is no <i>per se</i> ban on such laws. But VRA § 2 is targeted at precisely those voting qualifications that are <i>not</i> the subject of a per se ban. <i>See</i> S.Rep. No. 97-417, at 16 (explaining that under § 2 as amended in 1982, \"electoral devices... per se would not be subject to attack under section 2. They would only be vulnerable, if, in the totality of circumstances, they resulted in the denial of equal access to the electoral process\"). As plaintiffs do not allege that felon disenfranchisement laws are unlawful per se, but only as applied in Massachusetts, where they \"result in a denial ... of the right ... to vote on account of race,\" 42 U.S.C. § 1973, there is absolutely no conflict between § 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment and allowing plaintiffs to challenge disenfranchisement laws under the VRA.</p>\n<p>In other words, that § 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment contemplates disenfranchisement as a potential qualification is unremarkable. As similarly emphasized by the majority, \"[t]he criteria for eligibility to vote are defined by the states,\" and states have the power to fix all kinds of qualifications for voting, disqualifying felons included, but only where the exercise of that power \"do[es] not contravene any restriction that Congress, acting pursuant to its constitutional powers, has imposed.\" <i>Lassiter v.

Legislative History of VRA § 4</h2>\n<p>To support its contention that Congress did not intend to include felon disenfranchisement laws within the scope of VRA <i>§ 2,</i> the majority also relies on statements in the legislative history of <i>§ 4,</i> claiming that <i>§ 4</i> \"would not result in the proscription of the frequent requirement of States... that an applicant for voting ... be free of conviction of a felony.\" S.Rep. No. 89-162 (1965), <i>as reprinted in</i> 1965 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2508, 2562. This argument is deeply flawed. It is error to assume that a statement about one section of a statute applies to all other sections thereof. <i>See </i><i>Hayden,</i> 449 F.3d at 352-53 (Parker, J., dissenting) (stating that legislative history of one section of an expansive statute such as VRA is \"typically of no value\" when attempting to understand another, entirely different, section). In fact, the Supreme Court has explicitly warned against doing so in the VRA context. <i>Hall,</i> 512 U.S. at 883, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117874\"><a href=\"/opinion/117874/holder-v-hall/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2581</span></a></span> (\"To be sure, if the structure and purpose of § 2 mirrored that of § 5, then the case for interpreting §§ 2 and 5 to have the same application in all cases would be convincing. But the two sections differ in structure, purpose, and application.\"). This is especially true in the case before us given that the two provisions, § 2 and § 4, \"differ in structure, purpose, and application.\" <i>Id.</i> Specifically, § 4 is a provision that <i>categorically</i> bans, in covered jurisdictions, the use of certain facially neutral tests or devices including literacy tests, educational requirements, and \"any requirement that a person as a prerequisite for voting or registration for voting ... possess good moral character.\" <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. § 1973b(a)(1)(A), § 1973b(c). In contrast, § 2 applies to \"a broader range of practices than those `tests and devices' defined in Section 4.\" <i>Johnson,</i> 353 F.3d at 1306 n. 27. While § 4 applies only to \"covered jurisdictions,\" and \"imposes an outright ban on tests or devices,\" \"§ 2(a), [applies nationally, and] creates a `results' test, which requires investigating and weighing numerous factors.\" <i>Hayden,</i> 449 F.3d at 353 (Parker, J., dissenting) (internal citation omitted); <i>see also </i><i>Nw. Austin,</i> 557 U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145856\"><a href=\"/opinion/145856/northwest-austin-municipal-util-dist-no-one-v-holder/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2504</span></a></span>, 2508 (distinguishing § 2 of the VRA, which \"operates <i>nationwide</i> ... [to] forbid[ ] <i>any</i> `standard practice or procedure' that `results in a denial or the abridgment of the right of any citizen ... to vote on account of race or color'\" from § 4 and the remainder of the VRA which, \"[r]ather than continuing to depend on case-by-case litigation ... <span class=\"star-pagination\">*55</span> directly pre-empted the most powerful tools of black disenfranchisement in the <i>covered areas.</i>\" (emphasis added &amp; internal citations omitted)).</p>\n<p>Thus, considering congressional statements about § 4 in the context of the provision at which they were addressed (§ 4), they signify nothing about the scope of what <i>§ 2</i> was intended to cover. Given § 4's absolute bar on \"good moral character\" tests, and the natural susceptibility of \"moral character\" being read as a proxy for criminal history, the statements upon which the majority relies merely clarify that the categorical bar on \"good moral character\" tests in § 4 should not be interpreted as also an outright ban on felon disenfranchisement. <i>See </i><i>Hayden,</i> 449 F.3d at 364-65 (Calabresi, J., dissenting) (\"[S]uch legislative statements simply make the uncontroversial point that felon disenfranchisement laws are not `good moral character' requirements within the meaning of § 4(c).\"). In contrast, \"section 2 addresses voting regulations that are not per se invalid under section 4 but nonetheless result in a racially disparate impact on voting rights.\" Thomas G. Varnum, <i>Let's Not Jump to Conclusions: Approaching Felon Disenfranchisement Challenges Under the Voting Rights Act,</i> 14 Mich. J. Race &amp; L. 109, 136 (2008). Statements regarding § 4 thus provide no indication that Congress intended to insulate felon disenfranchisement laws from scrutiny under § 2 where it is alleged that the operation of a particular law results in the denial of the right to vote on account of race. <i>See </i><i>Johnson,</i> 405 F.3d at 1249 (Barkett, J., dissenting) (noting that decision not to add felon disenfranchisement statutes to list of per se violations does not show intent to exempt these laws from the VRA); <i>Hayden,</i> 449 F.3d at 365 (Calabresi, J., dissenting) (\"The fact that race-neutral felon disenfranchisement is permissible under § 4(c) tells us nothing at all about whether § 2 allows <i>racially discriminatory</i> felon disenfranchisement.\" (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p>In support of its argument for applying § 4's legislative history to § 2, the majority suggests that, in light of § 4's limited applicability to \"covered jurisdictions\" with a history of discrimination, in contrast to § 2's nationwide reach, Congress could not have \"permitted\" felon disenfranchisement laws in covered jurisdictions, while \"prohibiting\" them in non-covered jurisdictions like Massachusetts. But this argument similarly misses the mark, precisely because it mischaracterizes the statute. To be sure, the majority's argument would be persuasive if § 2 categorically \"prohibit[ted]\" felon disenfranchisement laws in Massachusetts and other \"non-covered\" jurisdictions. But it does not. <i>See</i> S.Rep. No. 97-417, at 16. Nor does the VRA \"permit\" felon disenfranchisement laws, in \"covered jurisdictions,\" or otherwise. Rather, § 2 uniformly imposes a \"totality of the circumstances\" test to <i>all</i> \"voting qualifications,\" <i>anywhere</i> in the country, prohibiting them only in the event that they result in racial discrimination. There is nothing illogical about creating a per se ban on certain <i>presumptively</i> discriminatory qualifications in \"covered jurisdictions\" only, as was done in § 4, but also permitting scrutiny of all voting qualifications nationally, including felon disenfranchisement laws, to ensure that no particular qualification is discriminatory as applied under the particular circumstances. And that is precisely what Congress did through § 2.</p>\n<p>By exporting the legislative history of § 4 into the § 2 context, the majority ignores the very plausible interpretation that Congress intended § 2 to include felony disenfranchisement laws precisely <i>because</i> it chose to exclude them from § 4's list of categorically barred regulations. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*56</span> While Congress did not seek to have felon disenfranchisement banned in all cases, it nevertheless intended that they be subjected, just like every other voting qualification anywhere in the country, to a \"totality of the circumstances\" test to assess whether they effectuate a discriminatory <i>result.</i> The fact that members of Congress were sufficiently cognizant of felon disenfranchisement laws to carve them out from the scope of § 4, yet made no such statements in regard to § 2, despite the intentionally broad language of that provision, indicates that Congress did not in fact intend a similar restriction in the § 2 context. <i>See </i><i>Vidal-Reyes,</i> 562 F.3d at 53 (<i>quoting </i><i>United States v. Councilman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201757\"><a href=\"/opinion/201757/united-states-v-councilman/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></a></span>, 73 (1st Cir.2005)) (\"`[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.'\").<sup>[37]</sup> Thus, as it stands, the legislative history of § 4 shows that while Congress did not intend to enact a blanket ban on felon disenfranchisement laws as a prohibited \"moral character\" requirement neither did it intend to exclude discriminatory laws from the scope of VRA scrutiny.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Historical Legitimacy and Congressional Endorsement of Felon Disenfranchisement Law</h2>\n<p>The remainder of the arguments in the majority opinion rely on Congress' sanctioning or presupposing the validity of felon disenfranchisement in various contexts, such as where (1) it has rejected proposals to outright bar felon disenfranchisement, either through the VRA or otherwise, and (2) endorsed disenfranchisement laws generally in the aftermath of the VRA.

Congressional refusal to pass categorical prohibitions on felon disenfranchisement or even its subsequent affirmation of the practice generally, is not inconsistent with Congress's clear intent to subject to scrutiny, through § 2 of the VRA, \"<i>any</i> state enactment which altered the election law of a covered State in even a minor way.\" <i>Allen,</i> 393 U.S. at 566-67, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Congress may very well have decided not to bar felon disenfranchisement wholesale (as it did by omitting it from § 4) and may even have endorsed the practice where it was motivated by and served legitimate ends. But it may have nevertheless chosen, in order to make the guarantees of the Fifteenth Amendment meaningful, to restrict the adoption of this \"qualification\" in those cases where it is applied \"in a manner which results\" in the denial of the right to vote on account of race. This reading of the legislative history, which is consistent with the statutory text, is far more compelling than the majority's analysis.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, \"the plainer the language, the more convincing contrary legislative history must be to overcome the natural purport of a statute's language.\" <i>United</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*57</span> <i>States v.

I see a clear textual mandate, uncontradicted by <i>any</i> legislative history, that felon disenfranchisement laws, like all voting qualifications, may be challenged under § 2 of the VRA. \"If the language of law is to have any meaning at all, then surely it must prevail over the kind of speculation that is entailed in such an enterprise as th[is] court[ ] ha[s] undertaken.\" <i>United States ex rel.

Thus, I would affirm the district court's decision on this issue.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Ex Post Facto Clause Claim</h2>\n<p>The second issue raised on appeal, a question of first impression in this circuit, is whether the retroactive application of a felon disenfranchisement provision violates the Ex Post Facto Clause when it is applied to felons incarcerated for crimes committed prior to the provision's passage into law. The Ex Post Facto Clause \"bars application of a law `that changes the punishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed to the crime, when committed[.]'\" <i>Johnson v.

Plaintiffs, incarcerated in Massachusetts for offenses committed prior to Article 120's enactment, contend that Article 120 is unconstitutional as applied to them because it subjects them to additional punishment not provided for by the laws of the Commonwealth when they committed the acts underlying their convictions. The majority affirms the dismissal of plaintiffs' claim on grounds that the deprivation of the right to vote, as accomplished by Article 120, does not constitute \"punishment,\" and thus, falls outside the protections of the Ex Post Facto Clause. I <span class=\"star-pagination\">*58</span> cannot agree. While disenfranchising convicted felons prospectively might be perfectly constitutional, I would hold that the disenfranchisement provision here is a punitive measure, which cannot be retroactively applied.</p>\n<p>\"The deprivation of any rights, civil or political, previously enjoyed, may be punishment, the circumstances attending and the causes of the deprivation determining this fact.\" <i>Cummings v.

As the majority accurately explains, analysis of whether a particular enactment imposes retroactive <i>punishment</i> so as to implicate the Ex Post Facto Clause requires a two-part inquiry. The first part asks whether the challenged law has a civil, regulatory purpose, or whether it is intended to punish. <i>See </i><i>Smith v.

Yet, in holding that Article 120 conveys a regulatory intent, the majority again departs from this well-established framework.</p>\n<p>The majority disposes of the first prong of <i>Smith</i> by citing <i>Trop v.

But leaving aside the merits of this proposition for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*59</span> the moment, the fact that disenfranchisement provisions are <i>generally</i> considered regulatory rather than punitive is not dispositive of what the Massachusetts voters and legislators intended here. Rather, the relevant questions are what Article 120's particular language says and if there are any inferences that can be drawn from its broader structure. <i>See </i><i>Smith,</i> 538 U.S. at 92, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127899\"><a href=\"/opinion/127899/smith-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Article 120, which was passed pursuant to a ballot question placed before Commonwealth voters, lacks any kind of express \"statement of purpose\" which legislation often includes, and none of its language reveals a particular government interest in felon disenfranchisement, either regulatory or punitive.<sup>[39]</sup> Instead, Article 120 merely lays out the substantive voting requirements, including the newly enacted exclusion of incarcerated felons.</p>\n<p>Beyond the language of the provision, it is possible that the \"broader structure\" of the provision may provide some indication of its purpose. <i>Id.</i> The majority relies on the placement of Article 120 within the Commonwealth's civil voter qualification provisions, rather than in its criminal code, to infer a regulatory purpose. But while manner of codification is certainly one factor relevant to ascertaining the nature of a provision, the Supreme Court has held that the \"location and labels of a statutory provision do not by themselves transform a civil remedy into a criminal one,\" or vice versa. <i>Smith,</i> 538 U.S. at 94, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127899\"><a href=\"/opinion/127899/smith-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

It follows that the Commonwealth's authority to regulate voting requirements as part of its civil power does not, in and of itself, establish that Article 120 was intended as a regulatory measure.</p>\n<p>Moreover, any inference of legislative intent that could be drawn from the codification of Article 120 in a civil section of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*60</span> Massachusetts' constitution is undermined by the fact that the Commonwealth was <i>required</i> to amend that constitutional provision, which governs voting qualifications generally, in order to disenfranchise felons. In addition, the subject matter of Article 120 is consistent not only with civil voting requirements, but also with criminal rules imposing an additional deprivation upon persons convicted of particular crimes and in the custody of the criminal justice system. In that sense, Article 120's broader structure implies both criminal punishment and civil regulation. In sum, neither the language nor the structure of Article 120 betrays a clear regulatory or punitive intent.</p>\n<p>Without a clear indication of intended purpose from Article 120 itself, we look to legislative history for evidence of legislative intent.<sup>[40]</sup><i>Rolland v. Romney,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200308\"><a href=\"/opinion/200308/rolland-v-romney/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></a></span>, 48 (1st Cir.2003). Here, there are two helpful sources of legislative history public statements made by Massachusetts' politicians about a series of disenfranchisement proposals that ultimately resulted in Article 120,<sup>[41]</sup> and the \"Information for Voters\" Guide (\"the Guide\") that was distributed to voters at the law's ratification stage.</p>\n<p>First, the public statements of proponents of the legislation are quite revealing of the punitive motivation behind Article 120. Writing to the Massachusetts Legislature to propose an earlier version of the instant disenfranchisement law, Governor Cellucci argued that \"the time has come to tell would-be criminals in Massachusetts that committing crimes has serious consequences.\"<sup>[42]</sup> He advocated for the proposal because it would \"ensure that criminals pay their debt to society before they regain their right to participate in the political process.\" Governor Cellucci also argued in favor of disenfranchising incarcerated felons because \"prisons are a place for punishment.\" Striking a similar tone, State Representative Paul Frost argued that prisoners \"don't deserve to vote\" and that \"this is an issue about justice.\" Senator Guy Glodis advocated for the law by stating that \"philosophically, no inmates deserve the right to vote.\" These comments, reflecting classic punitive rationales, <i>see, infra,</i> section II.B.4 (discussing traditional theories of criminal punishment), provide strong evidence that Article 120 was motivated by an intent to punish felons.</p>\n<p>As the majority recognizes, the Guide for voters regarding the ballot question <span class=\"star-pagination\">*61</span> that culminated in the enactment of Article 120, is also relevant to deciphering legislative intent. The Guide stated that the proposal would change the law that \"allows criminals to continue to exercise control over our lives by voting from prison.\" The majority found such language to indicate regulatory intent. I disagree. While this language is more ambiguous as to intent than anything else, it suggests to me another retributive statement about what felons \"deserve,\" i.e. to have their right to participate in government revoked. <i>See id.</i> The Guide also stated that \"[a] yes vote will protect democracy's greatest giftthe right to vote, by reserving it for the law-abiding.\" I believe this language is further evidence of the punitive principle of \"just desert.\" In any event, the ambiguous indications of intent revealed by the Guide do not outweigh the plainly punitive comments by the measure's proponents.</p>\n<p>Confronted with potentially mixed manifestations of legislative purposeand I believe such a characterization is generous to the Commonwealth's positionthis court should decipher the law's \"<i>primary</i> function.\" <i>See </i><i>Mendoza-Martinez,</i> 372 U.S. at 169, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106534\"><a href=\"/opinion/106534/kennedy-v-mendoza-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">554</span></a></span> (emphasis added). Whereas Article 120 itself is unclear as to intent, the Guide is also, at best, ambiguous, and the statements made by Massachusetts politicians are strongly indicative of punitive intent, I find that plaintiffs have made a compelling argument that the weight of the evidence of intent reveals Article 120 to have been intended primarily as a punitive measure. This punitive measure having been applied to plaintiffs retroactively, I believe that an Ex Post Facto violation could be found without further inquiry.

The Effect of Article 120 Is Punitive</h2>\n<p>Under the second prong of the <i>Smith</i> analysis, even if a clear punitive intent is not discernable for the challenged law, it would nevertheless constitute a criminal punishment subject to the Ex Post Facto Clause if the measure's effect is so punitive as to negate any intent to deem it civil. <i>Hendricks,</i> 521 U.S. at 361, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118136\"><a href=\"/opinion/118136/kansas-v-hendricks/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Scienter &amp; Criminality</h2>\n<p>The third and fifth <i>Mendoza-Martinez</i> factors, \"whether the challenged sanction comes into place only on a finding of scienter,\" and relatedly, \"whether the behavior to which it applies is already a crime,\" weigh heavily in favor of concluding that Article 120 is a penal statute. <i>See id.</i> at 168, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106534\"><a href=\"/opinion/106534/kennedy-v-mendoza-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

History</h2>\n<p>The second <i>Mendoza-Martinez</i> factor asks whether a particular sanction has \"historically been regarded as punishment.\" <i>Id.</i> at 168, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106534\"><a href=\"/opinion/106534/kennedy-v-mendoza-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">554</span></a></span>. There is substantial evidence to this effect. First of all, federal courts have frequently characterized felon disenfranchisement as a punitive measure. In its decision in <i>Johnson,</i> the Eleventh Circuit described felon disenfranchisement laws as a \"punitive device stemming from criminal law\" and explained that \"throughout history, criminal disenfranchisement provisions have existed as a punitive device.\" <i>See</i> 405 F.3d at 1228 &amp; n. 5. Similarly, the Second Circuit has noted the \"nearly universal use of felon disenfranchisement as a punitive device.\" <i>Muntaqim v. Coombe,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785940\"><a href=\"/opinion/785940/jalil-abdul-muntaqim-also-known-as-anthony-bottom-v-phillip-coombe/\"><span class=\"volume\">366</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">102</span></a></span>, 123 (2d Cir.2004) (vacated en banc on other grounds). \"Congress [has also] recognized the punitive nature of felon disenfranchisement laws.\" <i>See</i> Pamela A. Wilkins, <i>The Mark of Cain: Disenfranchised Felons and the Constitutional No Man's Land,</i> 56 Syracuse L.Rev. 85, 133-34 (2005) (describing how Congressional acts readmitting former Confederate States to the Union did so on the condition that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*63</span> States prohibited disenfranchisement \"except as a punishment for ... crimes\"). This point is reinforced by renowned historian, Alexander Keyssar's review of voting rights in this country in which he unequivocally characterizes America's felon disenfranchisement laws as an intentionally punitive device. <i>Id.</i> (citing Alexander Keyssar, <i>The Right to Vote: The Contested History of Democracy in the United States</i> 316 (2000)). And the ALI's Model Penal Code, a compilation examining the penal law of the United States, labels prisoner disenfranchisement \"an integral part of the criminal law.\" Model Penal Code § 306.3 (Proposed Official Draft 1962). This is strong evidence that, regardless of how a particular disenfranchisement provision is codified, the purpose of disenfranchising felons in American history has been to punish them for their crimes.</p>\n<p>There is also substantial evidence, presented by plaintiffs, of the historical use of felon disenfranchisement as a penal mechanism throughout the world. <i>See </i><i>Hayden,</i> 449 F.3d at 315-16 (describing use of \"civil death\" laws in Medieval continental Europe, \"attainder\" laws in medieval England, and \"infamy\" laws in ancient Greece and Rome, all of which revoked political rights, including the right to vote, \"as additional punishment for [certain] crimes\"); Keyssar, <i>supra,</i> at 62-63 (\"Disenfranchisement for [infamous] crimes had a long history in English, European, and even Roman law, and it [is] hardly surprising that the principle of attaching civil disabilities to the commission of crimes appeared in American law as well.\"). Although the district court dismissed this evidence as not relevant to disenfranchisement provisions in <i>American</i> history, that approach misreads this factor as used in <i>Mendoza-Martinez.</i> In fact, in <i>Mendoza-Martinez</i> itself, the Supreme Court explicitly relied on the history of citizenship deprivation in other countries in determining that the challenged law depriving draft evaders of citizenship was punitive in effect. <i>See</i> 372 U.S. at 168 n. 23, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106534\"><a href=\"/opinion/106534/kennedy-v-mendoza-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">554</span></a></span> (discussing Roman and English societies' use of forfeiting citizenship as a punishment). Thus, evidence of the historical use of felony disenfranchisement laws both in this country and others is relevant, and both reveal the prevalent historic use of such laws as a penal mechanism.</p>\n<p>To refute the extensive evidence that disenfranchisement laws have been historically regarded as punitive, the majority cites one court decision that did not concern the disenfranchisement of felons, <i>Trop. See</i> 356 U.S. at 96-97, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105659\"><a href=\"/opinion/105659/trop-v-dulles/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">590</span></a></span>. <i>Trop</i> does contain <i>dicta</i> suggesting hypothetically that \"the purpose of [a felon disenfranchisement statute] is to designate a reasonable ground of eligibility for voting,\" <i>id.,</i> but as <i>dicta,</i> that language is not binding upon us. <i>See</i> Wilkins, <i>supra,</i> at 102 (arguing that \"<i>Trop's</i> discussion of disenfranchisement statutes was <i>dicta</i> and, therefore, does not excuse judges from the hard work necessary to analyze real disenfranchisement laws\"). <i>Trop</i> also explains alternatively, that if \"[disenfranchisement] were imposed for the purpose of punishing [an offender], the statute[ ] would be penal.\" 356 U.S. at 96-97, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105659\"><a href=\"/opinion/105659/trop-v-dulles/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">590</span></a></span>. Moreover, that decision says nothing about how such laws have <i>historically</i> been regarded. In any event, the problem with relying on <i>Trop</i>'s suggestion that felon disenfranchisement could be a \"reasonable ground of eligibility for voting,\" is that <i>Trop</i> fails to reveal what legitimate purpose disenfranchisement serves that would render it a \"reasonable ground.\" This failure to identify why disqualifying felons is a \"reasonable ground\" is particularly problematic in light of the fact that both cases cited by <i>Trop</i> for this proposition, <i>Davis v. Beason</i> and <i>Murphy v. Ramsey</i><i>,</i> involve voting qualifications that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*64</span> are no longer regarded as valid.<sup>[43]</sup> As several scholars argue, <i>Trop</i> was decided at a time when the government had virtually unrestricted power to regulate the franchise, prior to the Warren's court's curtailment of that power when it recognized the fundamental nature of voting rights. <i>See</i> Wilkins, <i>supra,</i> at 102-04; Pamela S. Karlan, <i>Convictions and Doubts: Retribution, Representation, and the Debate Over Felon Disenfranchisement,</i> 56 Stan. L.Rev. 1147, 1150-54 (2004). As such, scholars argue that the <i>dicta</i> in <i>Trop</i> regarding the regulatory nature of felon disenfranchisement laws was premised on an \"outdated conception of voting rights,\" rendering its continued validity questionable. Wilkins, <i>supra,</i> at 102-04.</p>\n<p>Thus, seeing sparse evidence to the contrary, I am persuaded that the evidence cited by plaintiffs of the historical use of disenfranchisement weighs in favor of deeming the practice to be a punitive device.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Affirmative Disability or Restraint</h2>\n<p>In light of this country's struggle for independence in pursuit of participatory democracy and the centrality attributed to the right to vote in our legal and political culture,<sup>[44]</sup> I am compelled to conclude that the deprivation of the franchise is an \"affirmative disability or restraint\" of the gravest sort.</p>\n<p>Yet the majority concludes otherwise. In support of its holding that felon disenfranchisement does not constitute criminal punishment, the majority concludes that Article 120 does not impose \"any affirmative disability or restraint, physical or otherwise.\" To the extent the majority suggests that a restraint need be \"physical\" in order to resemble a punitive sanction, such a requirement simply does not exist. Rather, <i>Smith</i> discusses physical restraints as only <i>one</i> kind of possible restraint a criminal law might impose. <i>Smith,</i> 538 U.S. at 100, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127899\"><a href=\"/opinion/127899/smith-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1140</span></a></span>. In fact, our society regularly punishes wrongdoers without actually imposing physical restraints on them, most commonly, with criminal fines. And Supreme Court decisions tasked with applying the <i>Mendoza-Martinez</i> factors to ascertain the penal or regulatory nature of a particular sanction have regularly found <i>non-physical</i> sanctions to be affirmative disabilities or restraints. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Kurth Ranch,</i> 511 U.S. at 774, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087946\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087946/department-of-revenue-of-mont-v-kurth-ranch/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1937</span></a></span> (holding a tax on illegal drugs to be a punitive measure in part because it \"allowed for sanctions by restraint of Debtors' property\"). In fact, <i>Mendoza-Martinez</i> itself held a non-physical sanction, the deprivation of citizenship, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*65</span> to constitute a sanction \"essentially penal in character.\"</p>\n<p>The majority also argues that disenfranchisement during incarceration is not an affirmative disability because it is \"not as enduring as permanent occupational debarment.\" <i>See </i><i>Hawker v. New York,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"94855\"><a href=\"/opinion/94855/hawker-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">189</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1002</span></span> (1898) (holding that revocation of medical license does not violate the Ex Post Facto clause). But revoking a license to practice a particular profession is also not the deprivation of a <i>fundamental right.</i> In holding the revocation of citizenship rights to be punitive in <i>Mendoza-Martinez,</i> the Supreme Court emphasized that it is the \"utmost import\" and \"value\" of citizenship rights that renders their deprivation among the gravest of sanctions. <i>Mendoza-Martinez,</i> 372 U.S. at 160, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106534\"><a href=\"/opinion/106534/kennedy-v-mendoza-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Like citizenship itself, the right to vote, a fundamental component of citizenship, is certainly comparable in its utmost value and importance. <i>Tashjian v.

Disenfranchisement, though neither physical nor permanent, deprives U.S. citizens of a fundamental right, and as such, is undoubtedly an affirmative disability.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. Traditional Aims of Punishment</h2>\n<p>The fourth <i>Mendoza-Martinez</i> factor provides that a sanction is more likely punitive if \"its operation will promote the traditional aims of punishmentretribution and deterrence.\" <i>Mendoza-Martinez,</i> 372 U.S. at 168, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106534\"><a href=\"/opinion/106534/kennedy-v-mendoza-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1937</span></a></span>. It is, however, in its <i>retributive</i> nature that felon disenfranchisement truly reveals its punitive colors. <i>See</i> Karlan, <i>supra,</i> at 1166 (arguing that \"disenfranchisement really can be justified only under a retributive theory of criminal punishment\"). In this sense, this factor also conclusively weighs in favor of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p>As a form of retribution, \"`[p]unishment is the way in which society expresses its denunciation of wrongdoing.'\" <i>Gregg v. Georgia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109532\"><a href=\"/opinion/109532/gregg-v-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">153</span></a></span>, 184 n. 30, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109532\"><a href=\"/opinion/109532/gregg-v-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The notion is that the offender \"owes a debt to society\" and \"must now atone for his sins by suffering punishment for his transgression.\" Peter W. Low et. al., Criminal Law 2 (1982). \"This ... conception of punishment ... makes primary the meting out to a responsible wrongdoer of his just deserts.\" H.L.A. Hart, <i>Punishment and Responsibility,</i> 158-59 (1968). Other scholars have characterized the retributive aim of criminal punishment as predicated upon the notion of restoring the status quo after an offender, by his contravention of the law, has usurped from his victim or from society generally, something to which he is not fairly entitled. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Herbert Morris, <i>Guilt and Innocence,</i> 33-36 (1976) (characterizing punishment as restoring the fair distribution of benefits and burdens that is displaced when a person violates the rules that others have assumed, thereby gaining an unfair advantage); Jean Hampton, <i>Retributivism and Its Critics</i> (1992) (characterizing retributive punishment as a message that restores the prior status hierarchy between victim and offender which was violated by an offender's degradation of a victim's worth through criminality).</p>\n<p>In the context of the retributive purposes of criminal punishment, it becomes apparent how fundamentally intertwined criminal disenfranchisement laws generally, and Article 120 in particular, are with this punitive objective. The statement from Governor Cellucci's letter, referenced <i>supra,</i> that the disenfranchisement proposal would \"ensure that criminals pay their debt to society\" is the textbook articulation of the retributive theory. Similarly, Representative Frost's statement that felons do not \"deserve to vote\" is fundamentally linked to the retributive notion of \"just deserts.\" And Representative Marini's promise that the law would apply to those who did \"despicable things\" is consistent with theory of retributive punishment as a means by which society expresses its moral denunciation of unlawful conduct.</p>\n<p>Moreover, even the statements contained in the Information for Voters guide, cited by the Commonwealth as evidencing a regulatory non-punitive purpose, in fact, reveal the opposite when considered in the context of criminal punishment theory. For example, the statement that Article 120 would change the law that \"allows criminals to continue to exercise control over our lives by voting from prison,\" is consistent with Morris' and Hampton's notions of retributive punishment as a means of restoring the proper hierarchy between the offender and society, unfairly tipped in the offender's favor by his desecration of society's rules. By preventing offenders from benefitting further, at society's expense, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*67</span> through their political participation, disenfranchisement helps to restore that lost equilibrium. Finally, felon disenfranchisement laws, by \"deny[ing] the civic and human dignity of persons who have been convicted of doing wrong,\" are emblematic of the denunciatory function of criminal law. <i>See </i><i>Bell,</i> 441 U.S. at 592-93 n. 26, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110075\"><a href=\"/opinion/110075/bell-v-wolfish/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Moreover, the potential non-punitive rationales for felon disenfranchisement are, in many cases, now regarded as illegitimate grounds for restricting the vote, and as such, should not be credited. <i>See </i><i>Trop,</i> 356 U.S. at 96, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105659\"><a href=\"/opinion/105659/trop-v-dulles/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">590</span></a></span> (holding that a statute is non-penal \"if it imposes a disability, not to punish but to accomplish some other <i>legitimate governmental purpose.</i>\" (emphasis added)). That leaves criminal punishment as the only legitimate discernible \"legislative aim\" behind Article 120. I will consider, in turn, the various non-punitive justifications potentially assignable to Article 120 and explain why each cannot be rationally assignable to it.</p>\n<p>First, the majority suggests that the \"obvious rational non-punitive purpose for disenfranchisement\" is the concern about felons \"exercis[ing] control over [people's] lives by voting from prison.\" But as explained <i>supra,</i> this concern actually boils down to the punitive sentiment that felons do not \"deserve\" to do so.</p>\n<p>Second, the Commonwealth argues, on appeal, that the purpose of Article 120, evidenced by its placement alongside other valid voter qualifications in the Massachusetts constitution, was to exempt from the franchise those persons \"deem[ed] unfit to vote,\" such as minors, persons under guardianships, and persons convicted of corrupt election practices. That argument rests on the principle that, due to their lack of respect for the criminal law, felons, like minors and mentally incompetent persons, \"have raised questions about their ability to vote responsibly,\" and therefore, \"cannot be trusted\" to do so. Given the absence of any reference to voter \"competence\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*68</span> in the legislative history of Article 120, and the weak connection between disenfranchising incarcerated felons and the alleged interest in responsible voting, I am inclined to dismiss this explanation as a pre-textual rationale masking a punitive purpose. <i>See </i><i>Hendricks,</i> 521 U.S. at 371, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118136\"><a href=\"/opinion/118136/kansas-v-hendricks/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

This is because disenfranchising felons is both under and over-inclusive of this alleged rationale. It is under-inclusive because if persons who violate the law have shown that they cannot vote responsibly, then not only incarcerated felons, but all persons who commit any kind of crime should be disenfranchised, whether they are serving a custodial sentence or not. Moreover, all citizens who for any reason have shown themselves to be irresponsible voters should be disenfranchised as well. It is over-inclusive because some incarcerated felons, despite their prior transgressions, may have, through the rehabilitative elements of their sentence, developed great respect for society's rules. While it is true that \"[a] statute is not deemed punitive simply because it lacks a <i>close or perfect</i> fit with the non-punitive aims it seeks to advance,\" <i>Smith,</i> 538 U.S. at 102-03, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127899\"><a href=\"/opinion/127899/smith-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

This suggests that the concern with felons being \"unqualified\" is \"simply a fictional concern advanced to mask a punitive purpose.\" <i>United States v.

Thus, according to one scholar, \"contemporary voting rights doctrine casts a serious shadow on the central traditional non-penal justification for felon disenfranchisement: the claim that ex-offenders should not be permitted to vote because they lack the qualities of mind or character voters ought to possess.\" Karlan, <i>supra,</i> at 1152.</p>\n<p>Third, a similar analysis applies to the purported non-punitive \"regulatory\" purpose arbitrarily assigned to Article 120 by the district court. The district court suggested that prisoners are somehow unqualified to participate in the \"participatory and collegial process\" of \"representative democracy\" because they \"have limited access to information and little opportunity to discuss issues with individuals who are not also being punished for breaking the law.\" Not only is this \"inability-to-become-informed\" rationale entirely absent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*69</span> from the discussions motivating the enactment of Article 120, but it is simply not rationally connected with disenfranchising the entire convicted felon population, many of whom may very well have access to newspapers, media, and contact to outside visitors, as well as the leisure time to become politically informed, and thereby, even more knowledgeable voters than law-abiding persons on the \"outside.\" But again, and more importantly, the Supreme Court has consistently rejected restrictions on the franchise in order to further \"knowledgeable or intelligent voting.\" <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Dunn,</i> 405 U.S. at 356, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108485\"><a href=\"/opinion/108485/dunn-v-blumstein/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Thus, \"[i]f neither good character nor intelligent use of the ballot nor support for existing criminal laws are generally permissible prerequisites for voting, then it would be perverse to rely on criminal convictions as evidence that individuals lack qualities that voters are not required to have.\" Karlan, <i>supra,</i> at 1155. \"The obvious alternative is to conclude that disenfranchisement is indeed punitive and that if it is to be justified, it must be justified as a legitimate form of punishment, rather than as a species of political regulation.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Finally, that this \"alternative purpose\" factor of the <i>Mendoza-Martinez</i> analysis weighs in favor of deeming Article 120 a punitive sanction is bolstered by examining what has been found to constitute a \"legitimate non-punitive purpose\" in prior <i>Mendoza-Martinez</i> cases, and what has not. That examination reveals that those cases holding particular sanctions to constitute non-punitive regulatory measures have served far clearer and more substantial societal interests than the attenuated justifications provided for felon disenfranchisement. For example, in <i>Hendricks,</i> the state civil commitment law held to be non-punitive was intended to protect the public from dangerous mentally ill persons \"likely to engage in `predatory acts of sexual violence.'\" 521 U.S. at 350, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118136\"><a href=\"/opinion/118136/kansas-v-hendricks/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Similarly, Alaska's sexual offender registration requirement, held to be non-punitive in <i>Smith,</i> had the express purpose of \"protecting the public from sex offenders\" who \"pose a high risk of reoffending.\" 538 U.S. at 93, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127899\"><a href=\"/opinion/127899/smith-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In <i>Mendoza-Martinez,</i> where \"there was no reference to the societal good that would be wrought by the legislation,\" the Supreme Court concluded that \"the obvious inference\" was that \"Congress was concerned solely with inflicting effective retribution upon this class of draft evaders and, no doubt, on others similarly situated.\" <i>Mendoza-Martinez,</i> 372 U.S. at 182, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106534\"><a href=\"/opinion/106534/kennedy-v-mendoza-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">590</span></a></span> (holding that statute stripping military deserters of citizenship rights cannot rationally be treated other than as a penal law). Finding no legitimate non-penal interest served by the legislation, the Supreme Court in <i>Mendoza-Martinez</i> did not go on to speculate as to potential alternative justifications. But even if it had, the conceivable legitimate non-penal justification for stripping an American of his citizenship rights for violating a criminal statute prohibiting the evasion of military service, as in <i>Mendoza-Martinez</i> and <i>Trop,</i> is no more substantial than the conceivable justifications for stripping a U.S. citizen of an essential component of those rights (i.e. voting), for violating another criminal statute. Of course, one could argue that by abandoning the obligations of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*70</span> citizenship by evading the military obligations attendant thereto, a person shows that he is not \"competent\" to exercise the benefits and burdens of citizenship, just like one could argue that a person who breaches the criminal law shows that he is not competent to exercise the responsibility of aiding in its enactment. But the Supreme Court has refused to make this leap, and neither should we here. Given the similarities between the respective sanctions<sup>[47]</sup>deprivation of citizenship and deprivation of voting rightsthe lack of any clear non-punitive interest for either sanction, and the similar triggering event for the imposition of each, namely, violation of a criminal law, I think we are compelled by <i>Mendoza-Martinez</i> to hold Article 120 to be a penal measure. Finding Article 120 to be a penal measure, its constitutionality is subject to the constraints of the Ex Post Facto Clause, and violates that clause as retroactively applied to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p>To be abundantly clear, I see nothing constitutionally impermissible about disenfranchising felons as a form of criminal punishment. Criminals who are convicted of serious offenses pursuant to a legitimate process are properly deprived by the state of a panoply of fundamental individual and civil rights. But \"punishment\" must be labeled what it is, and imposed only in compliance with the time-honored constitutional guarantees that legitimate the exercise of that practice. Central among these guarantees is the prohibition against the enactment of ex post facto laws. As Article 120 inflicts a greater punishment upon convicted felons than the law annexed to their crimes when committed, <i>see </i><i>Calder v. Bull,</i> 3 Dall. 386, 390, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L.

Thus, I would reverse the decision of the district court as to the ex post facto claim, and order that judgment be entered for plaintiffs.</p>\n<p>For the reasons herein stated, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  By \"over-represented\" the complaint referred to the representation of African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans in the prison population compared with their representation in the Massachusetts population at large, but gave no statistics.</p>\n<p>[2]  Vote dilution claims comprise the vast majority of § 2 claims. <i>See</i> E.

This language in <i>Allen</i> must be understood in light of the Court's other statements in subsequent cases, including <i>Bolden</i> and <i>Bartlett.</i></p>\n<p>[13]  The 1965 legislative history indicates that Congress focused much more attention on the import of § 4 and § 5 than on § 2 of the VRA.</p>\n<p>[14]  Congress continued to revisit the discriminatory tests or devices banned by § 4. Later VRA amendments extended the § 4 ban on literacy tests nationwide. <i>See</i> Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1970, Pub.L. No. 91-285, § 201, 84 Stat. 314, 315 (current version at 42 U.S.C. § 1973aa) (extending temporary ban to entire nation); Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1975, Pub.L. No. 94-73, § 201, 89 Stat. 400, 400-01 (current version at 42 U.S.C. §§ 1973b-1973c) (making the temporary nationwide ban permanent). Congress never changed its view that felon disenfranchisement laws were not within the reach of the VRA.</p>\n<p>[15]  The 1975 Amendments to the VRA added protections for linguistic minorities and permanently banned literacy tests. 1975 Amendments §§ 203, 207, 89 Stat. at 401-02 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. §§ 1973b(f), 1973l(c)(3)). Nothing in those amendments indicated any intent to broaden the VRA to permit suits against state laws disenfranchising incarcerated felons.</p>\n<p>[16]  The proposed amendment would have authorized \"the Attorney General ... to institute in the name of the United States such actions against States ... including actions for injunctive relief, as he may determine to be necessary to implement the purposes of this title.\" <i>Ex-Offenders Voting Rights: Hearing on H.R. 9020, supra,</i> at 4 (quoting H.R. 9020, 93d Cong. (1973)).</p>\n<p>[17]  Under Supreme Court and circuit precedent, we read both § 2(a) and § 2(b) together and resort to legislative history. The text of § 2(b) is explicit that its purpose is to give content and context to the terms used in § 2(a). The Supreme Court has interpreted both sections together. <i>See </i><i>Bartlett,</i> 129 S.Ct. at 1241 (\"The 1982 amendments ... added... § 2(b), providing a test for determining whether a § 2 violation has occurred.\"); <i>Chisom,</i> 501 U.S. at 395, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112629\"><a href=\"/opinion/112629/chisom-v-roemer/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Section (b) provides guidance about how the results test is to be applied.\").\n</p>\n<p>This court's precedent also requires we read §§ 2(a) and 2(b) together and in light of history and context. <i>See </i><i>Metts,</i> 363 F.3d at 10 (\"The Delphic language of the [1982] amendment [to § 2] can be understood only against the background of its legislative history and subsequent Supreme Court interpretation.\").</p>\n<p>[18]  The context of the 1982 amendments confirms our understanding that § 2 was not amended in isolation from the rest of the statute and must be read in conjunction with the other sections, including § 4. The 1982 amendments to § 2 arose in the wake of <i>Bolden</i> because § 5 of the VRA was scheduled for reauthorization in that year by the terms of the 1975 VRA amendments. S. Issacharoff et al., <i>The Law of Democracy</i> 713-14 (rev.2d ed.2002). Indeed, in the House, most debate focused on the structure of the preclearance and bailout provisions of the VRA, while less attention focused on the § 2 amendments. <i>Id.</i> at 716; <i>see also</i> T.M. Boyd &amp; S.J. Markman, <i>The 1982 Amendments to the Voting Rights Act: A Legislative History,</i> 40 Wash. &amp; Lee L.Rev. 1347 (1983).</p>\n<p>[19]  Congress was clear about its intent. The Senate Report states:\n</p>\n<p>This Amendment is designed to make clear that proof of discriminatory intent is not required to establish a violation of Section 2. It thereby restores the legal standards, based on the controlling Supreme Court precedents, which applied in voting discrimination claims prior to the litigation involved in <i>Mobile v. Bolden.</i> The amendment also adds a new subsection to Section 2 which delineates the legal standards under the results test by codifying the leading pre-<i>Bolden</i> vote dilution case, <i>White v. Regester</i><i>.</i> <i>See</i> S.Rep. No. 97-417, at 2, <i>reprinted in</i> 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 177, 179; <i>see also id.</i> at 27, <i>reprinted in</i> 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 205 (\"The `results' standard is meant to restore the pre-<i>Mobile</i> legal standard which governed [vote dilution cases].\").</p>\n<p>[20]  The <i>Bolden</i> plurality also held that the \"language of § 2 [of the VRA] no more than elaborates upon that of the Fifteenth Amendment, and the sparse legislative history of § 2 makes clear that it was intended to have an effect no different from that of the Fifteenth Amendment itself.\" 446 U.S. at 61, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110246\"><a href=\"/opinion/110246/mobile-v-bolden/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

H.R. 906 was not drafted as an amendment to the VRA, but contained a savings clause clarifying that the measure operated in addition the VRA and the National Voter Registration Act. <i>Civic Participation and Rehabilitation Act of 1999: Hearing on H.R. 906, supra,</i> at 4. A number of recent unsuccessful bills are consistent with H.R. 906's proposal to restore the rights of only <i>former</i> felons. And even these have been flatly rejected by Congress. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Democracy Restoration Act of 2008, S. 3640, 110th Cong. (2008); Democracy Restoration Act of 2008, H.R. 7136, 110th Cong. (2008); Count Every Vote Act of 2005, S. 450, 109th Cong. (2005); Ex-Offenders Voting Rights Act of 2005, H.R. 663, 109th Cong. (2005).</p>\n<p>[23]  It is doubtful plaintiffs have articulated a viable § 2 direct denial theory, in any event. Plaintiffs have explained only that they think this claim falls within a broad reading of § 2, provided one ignores the text of § 4, the legislative history of the Act, and the purpose and context of § 2(b). But they have not explained even what their theory of liability is, what standards a court would apply, or what the components of a winning claim would be. This is the situation eight years after they filed suit and have had discovery from defendants.\n</p>\n<p>The most plaintiffs have suggested is that despite the self-evident racial neutrality of depriving all incarcerated felons from voting while imprisoned, there may be some causal connection between being incarcerated for felonies and their race. But the very 1994 Commission Report on which they rely concludes that no such connection was shown. More than that, it concluded that if one wished to see if such a connection could be shown, the data simply did not exist to permit the testing of the hypothesis. When plaintiffs asked the defendant officials in discovery for data which would presumably assist them, the defendants said they did not have and did not keep such data.</p>\n<p>There is nothing else. Even if one were to look more broadly at the Senate factors so often used in vote dilution cases, <i>see</i> S.Rep. No. 97-417, at 28-29 (1982), <i>reprinted in</i> 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 177, 206-07, those factors do not aid plaintiffs.</p>\n<p>Further, given our disposition of the case, we need not reach the concerns raised by Judge Kozinski about the role of evidence of statistical disparities in § 2 challenges. <i>Farrakhan,</i> 359 F.3d at 1119 (Kozinski, J. dissenting from denial of reh'g en banc); <i>see also </i><i>Ricci v.

No. 94-417, at 29 (1982), <i>as reprinted in</i> 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 177, 207. The ultimate inquiry, according to the Senate Report is \"whether, in the particular situation, the practice operated to deny the minority plaintiff an equal opportunity to participate and to elect candidates of their [sic] choice.\" <i>Id.</i> at 30. The Ninth Circuit, applying this test, has explicitly held that evidence of racial bias in the criminal justice system is a relevant \"social and historical condition\" for purposes of the totality of the circumstances test, reasoning that \"such discrimination would clearly hinder the ability of racial minorities to participate effectively in the political process as disenfranchisement is automatic.\" <i>Farrakhan,</i> 338 F.3d at 1020; <i>see also </i><i>Nipper v.

Soc. 559, 596 (2003).</p>\n<p>[28]  The majority attempts to distinguish <i>Farrakhan</i> on the ground that the Washington provision at issue in that case was \"not as narrow as this one.\" I, however, see no meaningful difference between disenfranchising felons until the completion of their sentences as under the Washington statute, or only while incarcerated, as in the case before us. In any event, the narrowness or breadth of a particular felon disenfranchisement scheme bears <i>no relevance</i> upon the question of whether challenges to these types of laws are cognizable under the VRA.</p>\n<p>[29]  We acknowledge that § 2(b) of the VRA, containing a \"totality of the circumstances\" test for proving a violation of § 2(a), may require further interpretation. However, any ambiguity in § 2(b) is irrelevant to whether a felon disenfranchisement provision is a voting qualification governed by the Acta question which the plain language of § 2(a) unambiguously answers in the affirmative. <i>See </i><i>Robinson,</i> 519 U.S. at 340, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118082\"><a href=\"/opinion/118082/robinson-v-shell-oil-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In response, the Attorney General said he had no objection to expanding the language of the section, to be all-inclusive. <i>Id.</i> Congress then expanded the language in the final version of § 2 to include any \"`voting qualifications or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 1973 (1964)).</p>\n<p>[32]  In fact, in his concurrence in <i>Holder v.

Although Justice Thomas argued for a more restrictive interpretation of the scope of § 2 than the majority of the Supreme Court had recognized, his <i>more restrictive</i> interpretation of the provision was as follows:\n</p>\n<p>[T]he specific items described in § 2(a) ... indicate that Congress was concerned in this section with <i>any procedure, however it might be denominated, that regulates citizens' access to the ballot</i>that is, any procedure that might erect a barrier to prevent the potential voter from casting his vote.</p>\n<p><i>Id.</i> (emphasis added). Surely, felon disenfranchisement laws, which outright bar a segment of the population from voting, fall into this expansive category.</p>\n<p>[33]  <i>See also</i> George Brooks, Comment, <i>Felon Disenfranchisement: Law, History, Policy and Politics,</i> 32 Fordham Urb.

While the majority states that it will consider certain comments made by Governor Cellucci, it never analyzes these or other comments by Article 120's proponents relevant to the legislative history of the provision.</p>\n<p>[41]  The legislative process resulting in the passage of Article 120 is worth noting.
