The question presented is whether\n\nto require vacatur of a district court order when the parties,\n\nhaving settled the case on appeal, join in requesting it.\n\n            Anabelle Rodriguez, the Secretary of Justice of the\n\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico, appealed from the federal district\n\ncourt's grant of a preliminary injunction prohibiting her from\n\npursuing an antitrust action which she had filed against Wal-Mart\n\nStores, Inc. in a Puerto Rico court.         The action in the Puerto Rico\n\ncourt claimed, inter alia, that the divestiture of four stores,\n\napproved by the FTC attendant to Wal-Mart's acquisition of a Puerto\n\nRico supermarket     chain,     violated    the   Commonwealth's    antitrust\n\nstatute.     See 10 P.R. Laws Ann. §§ 257-276 (2002).\n\n            On December 6, 2002, despite a previously-issued federal\n\ntemporary    restraining   order      prohibiting    her   from    doing   so,\n\nRodriguez sought and obtained from the Puerto Rico court an ex\n\nparte preliminary injunction that enjoined Wal-Mart from taking\n\nfurther steps to consummate the merger.              Wal-Mart had filed a\n\nfederal court action earlier that day under 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n\n(2000),     contending   that   the    Secretary's    purported     antitrust\n\nconcerns were a sham and that the Secretary's court action was\n\nunconstitutionally filed in retaliation for Wal-Mart's refusal to\n\naccede to the Secretary's unlawful protectionist demands.                  The\n\ndistrict court, on December 17, 2002, denied the Secretary's motion\n\nthat it abstain under the doctrine of Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S.\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f37 (1971).        After a three-day evidentiary hearing, the court\n\nentered the preliminary injunction on December 26.\n\n            The Secretary appealed, arguing, inter alia, that the\n\ndistrict    court       should   have   abstained    and    that   issuance     of\n\ninjunctive relief was improper.               Wal-Mart argued that Younger\n\nabstention was unwarranted and that the injunction was not an abuse\n\nof discretion.         This court denied the Secretary's application for\n\na stay of the federal preliminary injunction and expedited the\n\nappeal. We received several briefs amicus curiae in support of the\n\nSecretary from the chief enforcement officers of twenty states, the\n\nAmerican Antitrust Institute, and others, expressing concern about\n\na federal court enjoining enforcement of a state antitrust law.\n\n            Oral argument was scheduled for March 6, 2003.                On March\n\n3, the parties filed a \"Joint Motion Requesting Remand to the\n\nDistrict Court with Instructions to Dismiss the Underlying Action\n\nwith Prejudice and to Vacate the Preliminary Injunction and Opinion\n\nand Order Below.\"          In the motion the parties reported they had\n\nentered    into    a    stipulation     of   settlement    dispositive     of   the\n\ncontroversy       underlying     the    appeal.     A     key   element   of    the\n\nstipulation and motion is the request that this court remand to the\n\ndistrict court with instructions not only to dismiss the complaint\n\nwith prejudice but likewise to vacate the December 26 preliminary\n\ninjunction and the court's related opinion and order. In the joint\n\nmotion, the Secretary represented that moving for vacatur of the\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fopinion and order was an \"essential component of the appellant's\n\nentry into the stipulation of settlement,\" as \"she is primarily\n\nconcerned about the impact of the decision below on her obligations\n\nas   the   official      with   principal         responsibility       to     institute\n\nenforcement actions under and otherwise enforce Puerto Rico's\n\nantitrust laws;\" and       - - citing to Massachusetts' amicus brief on\n\nbehalf of 19 states - - she also believes the decision below\n\nadversely implicates issues of federal-state relations of concern\n\nto many states.\n\n            Ordinarily,     the   settlement         of   a   case     will    lead    to\n\ndismissal of an action but not to vacatur of the orders already\n\nissued.    In U.S. Bancorp Mortgage Co. v. Bonner Mall Partnership,\n\n513 U.S.    18   (1994),    the   Supreme         Court   held   unanimously      that\n\nvacating a judgment in these circumstances (as part of dismissal of\n\nan appeal pursuant to a settlement agreement) was the exception,\n\nnot the rule, and must be justified by equitable circumstances.\n\nId. at 29.       Vacatur may be appropriate where mootness arises\n\nthrough    \"happenstance,\"      id.    at    25    (quoting      United     States     v.\n\nMunsingwear,     Inc.,    340   U.S.   36,    40     (1950)),     or    through       the\n\nunilateral action of the party prevailing below, see id., but not\n\nnecessarily where the appellant moots the case by settlement or\n\nwithdrawal of the appeal, id. at 25-26.                       See Kerkhof v. MCI\n\nWorldCom, Inc., 282 F.3d 44, 53-54 (1st Cir. 2002).                     Accordingly,\n\nby order entered March 4, 2003, this court requested the parties to\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fbrief what equitable circumstances, if any, warranted vacatur. The\n\nparties filed a joint brief in response.\n\n            Pursuant to the settlement, the Secretary dismissed her\n\ncase   in   the    Puerto    Rico    court,     freeing   Wal-Mart   from   the\n\npreliminary injunction against it.             Wal-Mart agreed to divest two\n\nstores in addition to the four stores covered by the FTC agreement,\n\nand made certain promises related to its labor and purchasing\n\npractices in Puerto Rico.          The Secretary seeks vacatur because she\n\nfears that the district court decision may impair her in her duties\n\nto enforce the laws of the Commonwealth.              Wal-Mart agreed to join\n\nthe motion for vacatur solely because Wal-Mart believes that\n\nresolution of this controversy by means of settlement is in the\n\ninterest of the parties, of justice, and of the public.\n\n            The equitable decision on vacatur rests in the discretion\n\nof this court.      Kerkhof, 282 F.3d at 53.         We agree with the parties\n\nthat the special circumstances of this case warrant vacatur of the\n\ndistrict court's preliminary injunction and the associated opinion\n\nand orders.       Our precedent supports vacatur here.\n\n            As    in    Kerkhof,    vacating   the   judgment   preserves   the\n\nability of both sides to litigate the issues should they arise\n\nagain.   Id. at 54.       The issues before the district court here were\n\ncomplicated, involving weighty concerns of both federalism and\n\nantitrust law.         This settlement was not motivated by one party or\n\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fthe other attempting to obtain a strategic advantage from the\n\nexistence of that injunction.\n\n           As in Motta v. District Director of INS, 61 F.3d 117, 118\n\n(1st Cir. 1995) (per curiam), the party seeking vacatur is a\n\ngovernment agency, a repeat player in the courts.         The government\n\nhas an institutional interest in vacating adverse rulings of\n\npotential precedential value.        Id.   While the strength of that\n\ninterest may vary under different circumstances, it is sufficiently\n\nstrong here, both abstractly and specifically because of the\n\nSecretary's insistence that the settlement will fail if vacatur is\n\nnot   granted.1   It   would   be   inequitable   here   to   require   the\n\nSecretary to choose between the strong public interest in settling\n\nthe case amicably and her interest as chief enforcement officer in\n\nremoving adverse precedent.         And Wal-Mart, whose attempts to\n\nconsummate a merger and acquisition transaction which closed on\n\nDecember 5, 2002 have been enmired in litigation ever since, has an\n\ninterest in ending litigation which has frustrated its need for\n\nbusiness certainty.\n\n           Finally, federalism concerns support vacatur here.           The\n\nSecretary's actions in proceeding in Puerto Rico's courts in the\n\nface of a federal court restraining order were certainly unusual.\n\n\n      1\n          The fact that a party conditions a settlement on\nachieving vacatur does not by itself provide the needed equitable\ncircumstances. Such a rule would essentially remove the decision\nfrom the court and hand it to the parties, in violation of the U.S.\nBancorp rule.\n\n                                    -7-\n\fBut then a federal action to restrain a local law enforcement\n\nofficial from bringing a local antitrust action is itself unusual.\n\nThe Secretary has dismissed the Commonwealth's enforcement action\n\nand freed Wal-Mart of that constraint.           Similarly freeing the\n\nSecretary here is an equitable outcome.\n\n           Accordingly, we grant the request and remand to the\n\ndistrict   court   with   instructions    to   vacate   the   preliminary\n\ninjunction, opinion and order issued on December 26, 2002 and to\n\ndismiss the case with prejudice.         Each side shall bear its own\n\ncosts.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f",

The action in the Puerto Rico court claimed, inter alia, that the divestiture of four stores, approved by the FTC attendant to Wal-Mart's acquisition of a Puerto Rico supermarket chain, violated the Commonwealth's antitrust statute. <i>See</i> 10 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167;&#167; 257-276 (2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 6, 2002, despite a previously-issued federal temporary restraining order prohibiting her from doing so, Rodriguez sought and obtained from the Puerto Rico court an ex parte preliminary injunction that enjoined Wal-Mart from taking further steps to consummate the merger. Wal-Mart had filed a federal court action earlier that day under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 (2000), contending that the Secretary's purported antitrust concerns were a sham and that the Secretary's court action was unconstitutionally filed in retaliation for Wal-Mart's refusal to accede to the Secretary's unlawful protectionist demands. The district court, on December 17, 2002, denied the Secretary's motion that it abstain under the doctrine of <i>Younger v. Harris,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108263\"><a href=\"/opinion/108263/younger-v-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108263\"><a href=\"/opinion/108263/younger-v-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">669</span></a></span> (1971). After a three-day evidentiary hearing, the court entered the preliminary injunction on December 26.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary appealed, arguing, inter alia, that the district court should have abstained and that issuance of injunctive relief was improper. Wal-Mart argued that <i>Younger</i> abstention was unwarranted and that the injunction was not an abuse of discretion. This court denied the Secretary's application for a stay of the federal preliminary injunction and expedited the appeal. We received several briefs amicus curiae in support of the Secretary from the chief enforcement officers of twenty states, the American Antitrust Institute, and others, expressing concern about a federal court enjoining enforcement of a state antitrust law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Oral argument was scheduled for March 6, 2003. On March 3, the parties filed a \"Joint Motion Requesting Remand to the District Court with Instructions to Dismiss the Underlying Action with Prejudice and to Vacate the Preliminary Injunction and Opinion and Order Below.\" In the motion the parties reported they had entered into a stipulation of settlement dispositive of the controversy underlying the appeal. A key element of the stipulation and motion is the request that this court remand to the district court with instructions not only to dismiss the complaint with prejudice but likewise to vacate the December 26 preliminary injunction and the court's related opinion and order. In the joint motion, the Secretary represented that moving for vacatur of the opinion and order was an \"essential component of the appellant's entry into the stipulation of settlement,\" as \"she is primarily concerned about the impact of the decision below on her obligations as the official with principal responsibility to institute enforcement actions under and otherwise enforce Puerto Rico's antitrust laws;\" and&#8212;citing to Massachusetts' amicus brief on behalf of 19 states&#8212;she also believes the decision below adversely implicates issues of federal-state relations of concern to many states.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily, the settlement of a case will lead to dismissal of an action but not to vacatur of the orders already issued.

Accordingly, by order entered March 4, 2003, this court requested the parties to brief what equitable circumstances, if any, warranted vacatur. The parties filed a joint brief in response.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to the settlement, the Secretary dismissed her case in the Puerto Rico court, freeing Wal-Mart from the preliminary injunction against it. Wal-Mart agreed to divest two stores in addition to the four stores covered by the FTC agreement, and made certain promises related to its labor and purchasing practices in Puerto Rico. The Secretary seeks vacatur because she fears that the district court decision may impair her in her duties to enforce the laws of the Commonwealth. Wal-Mart agreed to join the motion for vacatur solely because Wal-Mart believes that resolution of this controversy by means of settlement is in the interest of the parties, of justice, and of the public.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The equitable decision on vacatur rests in the discretion of this court. <i>Kerkhof,</i> 282 F.3d at 53. We agree with the parties that the special circumstances of this case warrant vacatur of the district court's preliminary injunction and the associated opinion and orders. Our precedent supports vacatur here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As in <i>Kerkhof,</i> vacating the judgment preserves the ability of both sides to litigate the issues should they arise again. <i>Id.</i> at 54. The issues before the district court here were complicated, involving weighty concerns of both federalism and antitrust law. This settlement was not motivated by one party or the other attempting to obtain a strategic advantage from the existence of that injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As in <i>Motta v. District Director of INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"700611\"><a href=\"/opinion/700611/antonio-jose-p-motta-v-district-director-of-immigration-naturalization/\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">117</span></a></span>, 118 (1st Cir.1995) (per curiam), the party seeking vacatur is a government agency, a repeat player in the courts. The government has an institutional interest in vacating adverse rulings of potential precedential value. <i>Id.</i> While the strength of that interest may vary under different circumstances, it is sufficiently strong here, both abstractly and specifically because of the Secretary's insistence that the settlement will fail if vacatur is not granted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> It would be inequitable here to require the Secretary to choose between the strong public interest in settling the case amicably and her interest as chief enforcement officer in removing adverse precedent. And Wal-Mart, whose attempts to consummate a merger and acquisition transaction which closed on December 5, 2002 have been enmired in litigation ever since, has an interest in ending litigation which has frustrated its need for business certainty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, federalism concerns support vacatur here. The Secretary's actions in proceeding in Puerto Rico's courts in the face of a federal court restraining order were certainly unusual. But then a federal action to restrain a local law enforcement official from bringing a local antitrust action is itself unusual. The Secretary has dismissed the Commonwealth's enforcement action and freed Wal-Mart of that constraint. Similarly freeing the Secretary here is an equitable outcome.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we <i>grant</i> the request and <i>remand</i> to the district court with instructions to <i>vacate</i> the preliminary injunction, opinion and order issued on December 26, 2002 and to <i>dismiss</i> the case with prejudice. Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The fact that a party conditions a settlement on achieving vacatur does not by itself provide the needed equitable circumstances. Such a rule would essentially remove the decision from the court and hand it to the parties, in violation of the<i>U.S. Bancorp</i> rule.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
