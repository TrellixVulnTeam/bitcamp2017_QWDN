Acting   on   Amando   Monteiro's\n\npretrial motion, the district court suppressed from evidence two\n\nguns the police obtained during a vehicle stop.              The government\n\nsought our review pursuant to 18 U.S.C ยง 1371, which authorizes\n\ninterlocutory appeals in situations such as this.            We affirm.\n\n                                     I.\n\n            In an appeal from a suppression order, the district\n\ncourt's findings of fact govern absent a showing of clear error.\n\nOrnelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690, 699 (1996).           Neither party\n\nsuggests that the district court made such an error, so we recite\n\nthe facts as the district court found them.               We also add a few\n\nundisputed details from the record.\n\n            Shortly after 4:00 P.M. on March 25, 1999, Boston police\n\nresponded   to   reports   of    gunfire    on   Eastman    Street,   in   the\n\nDorchester section of the city.           The target of the shooting, who\n\nescaped unharmed, was Antonio Cabral.         The police knew that Cabral\n\nwas associated with a gang and that his gang and its rival had been\n\ninvolved in a series of shootings.         At the scene on Eastman Street,\n\npatrol officers James Coyne and Thomas Griffiths spoke with Cabral\n\nfor about an hour.     Cabral reported that two men had shot at him\n\nthrough a fence, while he was standing in his driveway.               Cabral\n\nsaid he had no knowledge of the identity of the shooters, but\n\nanother person who had been nearby told the police that a red Mazda\n\nhad raced away from Eastman Street shortly after the shooting.\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f          At around 8:00 P.M. that evening, Coyne and Griffiths\n\nreturned to Eastman Street and interviewed Cabral again.        This\n\ntime, Cabral's mother and brother were present.   Cabral again said\n\nhe had no information for the police.   The Cabrals complained that\n\nthe police \"weren't doing enough in the community to stop the\n\nviolence.\"   Coyne responded that the police could do more if\n\nneighborhood residents would \"give us information for us to solve\n\nthese shootings.\"   Cabral then said that he had no information to\n\noffer about his own shooting but that he had information about\n\nanother shooting that same day.    Cabral said that a relative told\n\nhim that she had witnessed gunfire on Shirley Street from two cars,\n\na red Mazda and a red Honda with license plate 5021EV.   Coyne asked\n\nCabral who the relative was.    Coyne understood Cabral to indicate\n\nthat the relative was female, but Cabral refused to give her name\n\nor any other information about her.     The police made no further\n\nattempts to identify or locate the unnamed relative.\n\n          That same evening, Coyne and Griffiths drove to Shirley\n\nStreet and looked for some evidence of gunfire, such as spent shell\n\ncasings or bullet damage.      They found none.   The officers also\n\nsearched the police department's records to see if anybody had\n\nreported gunfire on Shirley Street.      No one had.     Coyne later\n\ntestified at the suppression hearing that it was typical for\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fshootings in the neighborhood to be reported to 911, and for\n\nobvious evidence of gunfire to be found at the scene.1\n\n            Coyne ran the 5021EV license plate number through the\n\nvehicle registration database and matched the plates to a red Honda\n\nbelonging   to   Marcelino    Rodrigues.   Coyne   was   familiar   with\n\nRodrigues and suspected that he was affiliated with a gang that was\n\na rival to Cabral's.         Coyne also knew that Rodrigues had been\n\narrested three weeks earlier in Randolph, Massachusetts, on a\n\nfirearms possession charge.2        Coyne and Griffiths went to the\n\naddress Rodrigues had listed on his vehicle registration, but\n\nRodrigues was not there.        That night, the officers looked for\n\nRodrigues around the neighborhood but did not find him.      Coyne and\n\nGriffiths radioed other officers in the area to be on the lookout\n\nfor Rodrigues and the red Honda, but no one saw Rodrigues or his\n\ncar.\n\n            A full week passed during which the police apparently\n\nconducted no further investigation of the possible shooting on\n\nShirley Street. Then, on March 31st, Coyne, Griffiths, and a third\n\n\n\n       1\n       Specifically, Coyne testified that after shootings in the\nneighborhood:\n\n       There would be parties outside.   There would be\n       numerous 911 calls. . . . You'd get to the scene.\n       There would be cars, multiple cars shot up,\n       ballistics damage in the street.\n       2\n       The charges against Rodrigues from the Randolph arrest\neventually were dismissed.\n                                   -4-\n\fofficer were conducting a traffic stop when they saw Rodrigues and\n\ntwo passengers drive by.        The officers rushed to their cars,\n\npursued Rodrigues, and pulled him over for \"field interrogation and\n\nobservation.\"3    There   was   no   traffic   violation   or   suspicious\n\nactivity.   The defendant was one of Rodrigues's passengers.\n\n            Although this appeal is limited to the legality of the\n\ninitial vehicle stop, we relate briefly what happened thereafter.\n\nThe officers ordered Rodrigues and his passengers to step out of\n\nthe car.    The third officer, who was not available to testify at\n\nthe suppression hearing, told Coyne that he had seen a gun in the\n\ncenter console of the car.4      The police then handcuffed Rodrigues\n\nand his passengers and, upon obtaining a search warrant, searched\n\nthe car and recovered two guns.       These guns comprise the evidence\n\nat issue in this appeal.        At the scene, the police questioned\n\nRodrigues about the purported Shirley Street shooting and about the\n\nattempted shooting of Cabral on Eastman Street.        Rodrigues denied\n\ninvolvement in either event.5\n\n\n     3\n       We quote this phrase, which appears to be a term of art in\nthe Boston Police Department, from Officer Coyne's testimony at the\nsuppression hearing. Coyne explained that he meant that he had\nstopped Rodrigues's car to \"get information\" by \"speaking to [the\ndriver].\"\n     4\n       At least one of the police officers had seen Rodrigues\nleaning towards the center of his car as the police pulled him\nover, after the stop was initiated (the government does not rely on\nthis evidence in arguing for the legality of the initial stop).\n     5\n       Later, after agreeing to cooperate with the government,\nRodrigues testified at the suppression hearing that he had indeed\n                                     -5-\n\f               Subsequently, the state and federal governments indicted\n\nthe defendant on a variety of charges.          In both prosecutions, the\n\ndefendant sought to suppress evidence gathered in connection with\n\nthe March 31st stop of Rodrigues's car.6          The district court held\n\na two-day evidentiary hearing and issued a thoughtful order.              The\n\ncourt concluded: \"While this is a borderline case, once the tip [of\n\na shooting on Shirley Street] proved to be unreliable, the hunch\n\n[that Rodrigues was involved in criminal activity] was not enough\n\nto establish a reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal\n\nactivity sufficient to stop the red Honda.\"\n\n                                       II.\n\n               The sole question in this interlocutory appeal is whether\n\nthe   police      acted   reasonably   in    stopping   Rodrigues   and   his\n\npassengers on March 31st.          Because only the district court's\n\nultimate Fourth Amendment conclusion is at issue, our review is de\n\nnovo.       United States v. Paradis, 351 F.3d 21, 24 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n               When a police officer makes \"brief investigatory stops of\n\npersons and vehicles that fall short of traditional arrest . . .\n\nthe Fourth Amendment is satisfied if the officer's action is\n\nsupported by reasonable suspicion that criminal activity may be\n\n\n\nbeen involved in the attempted shooting of Cabral. Rodrigues also\ntestified that there had been no shooting on Shirley Street on\nMarch 25th.\n        6\n       The state court also granted the defendant's motion to\nsuppress.\n                                       -6-\n\fafoot,\" United States v. Arvizu, 534 U.S. 266, 273 (2002) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted), or if there is \"reasonable suspicion,\n\ngrounded in specific and articulable facts, that [the stopped]\n\nperson . . . was involved in or is wanted in connection with a\n\ncompleted felony,\" United States v. Hensley, 469 U.S. 221, 229\n\n(1985).   In evaluating whether reasonable suspicion existed, we\n\n\"look at the totality of the circumstances of each case to see\n\nwhether the detaining officer ha[d] a particularized and objective\n\nbasis for suspecting legal wrongdoing.\"     Arvizu, 534 U.S. at 273\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).       The government bears the\n\nburden of showing such a basis.      See Florida v. Royer, 460 U.S.\n\n491, 500 (1983) (plurality opinion); Brown v. Texas, 443 U.S. 47,\n\n52 (1979).    We allow police officers \"to draw on their own\n\nexperience and specialized training\" in making a vehicle stop.\n\nArvizu, 534 U.S. at 273.    But the reasonable suspicion standard\n\nimposes meaningful limits on temporary detentions. \"[A]n officer's\n\nreliance on a mere 'hunch' is insufficient to justify a stop.\"   Id.\n\nat 274 (quoting Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 27 (1968)).\n\n          While the defendant was neither the driver of the vehicle\n\nstopped on March 31st nor then the subject of police suspicion, he\n\nwas seized when the police stopped Rodrigues's car.   Consequently,\n\nhe has the right to contest the legality of that stop.   See United\n\nStates v. Woodrum, 202 F.3d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n\n\n\n                               -7-\n\f                                           III.\n\n               The    government       contends        that     the   totality      of    the\n\ncircumstances known to the police provided adequate justification\n\nfor the March 31st vehicle stop.                    In its briefs, the government\n\nsuggests that the police may have suspected Rodrigues of three\n\ntypes of wrongdoing: the purported shooting on Shirley Street; the\n\nattempted       shooting        of   Cabral    on     Eastman    Street;     and    ongoing\n\ninvolvement in what the government terms \"gang warfare.\"                            However,\n\nthe   government          conceded    at   oral     argument      that    there     is    \"no\"\n\ninformation          in   the    record       tying    Rodrigues      or    his     car     to\n\n\"involvement in the Eastman Street shooting.\"                            (Coyne had said\n\nessentially the same while testifying at the suppression hearing.)\n\nFurthermore, while the police suspected Rodrigues of being a gang\n\nmember, the government does not contend that there was any reason\n\nto suspect that Rodrigues and his passengers were involved in\n\ncriminal activity when the stop took place on March 31st, or that\n\nthey were about to be so involved.\n\n               The    government       does     argue     that     the     police    had    a\n\nreasonable suspicion, grounded in specific and articulable facts,\n\nthat Rodrigues had committed a crime on Shirley Street on March\n\n25th.       (Coyne testified that investigation of this purported crime\n\nwas his actual motivation in stopping the Honda on March 31st.)7\n\n\n        7\n       Of course, reasonable suspicion is an \"objective legal\nstandard,\" Ornelas, 517 U.S. at 701, and does not \"depend[] on the\nactual motivations of the individual officers involved,\" Whren v.\n                                              -8-\n\f             The tip from Cabral's unidentified relative is the focus\n\nof the government's argument. Therefore, in section A, we evaluate\n\nthe appropriate place in the reasonable suspicion analysis i) of\n\nthat   tip   and    ii)   of   the   factors   that   the    government   argues\n\ncorroborated it.       We conclude that the minimally corroborated tip\n\ndid not alone provide reasonable suspicion for a vehicle stop on\n\nMarch 31st.        In section B, we consider the tip and its minimal\n\ncorroboration with the other information known to the police on\n\nMarch 31st.     We conclude that the totality of the circumstances,\n\nincluding the tip, did not provide reasonable suspicion to stop the\n\ncar on March 31st.\n\nA.   The Tip From Cabral's Relative\n\n             The only indication that a shooting actually had occurred\n\non Shirley Street was the hearsay statement of Cabral's unnamed\n\nrelative, as relayed to the police by Cabral.               Three Supreme Court\n\ncases provide the basic parameters for determining whether an\n\ninformant's tip provides reasonable suspicion for a Terry stop.\n\nThe first of these cases is Adams v. Williams, 407 U.S. 143 (1972).\n\nIn Adams, the Supreme Court concluded that a police officer was\n\nwarranted in conducting a Terry stop on the basis of an in-person\n\ntip from a \"person known to him\" that a man \"seated in a nearby\n\nvehicle [in a high-crime area] was carrying narcotics and had a gun\n\nat his waist.\"       Id. at 144-45.       The Court so held in large part\n\n\nUnited States, 517 U.S. 806, 813 (1996).\n                                       -9-\n\fbecause the informant was known personally to the police officer,\n\nand \"had provided him with information in the past,\" and because\n\nthe informant would be subject to prosecution for supplying false\n\ninformation to the police.              Id. at 146.    As a leading academic\n\ncommentator on the Fourth Amendment has written, Adams makes clear\n\nthat \"suspicious circumstances reported to the police by a reliable\n\n[known]    person    in     a    nonconclusory    fashion\"     may   in   certain\n\ncircumstances be sufficient to warrant a Terry stop.                 4 W. LaFave,\n\nSearch and Seizure 576 (4th ed. 2004).\n\n            Anonymous tips are a different matter.                    The second\n\nrelevant Supreme Court case, Alabama v. White, 496 U.S. 325 (1990),\n\ninvolved an anonymous telephone call to the police, which stated\n\n\"that    Vanessa    White       would   be   leaving   235-C   Lynwood    Terrace\n\nApartments at a particular time in a brown Plymouth station wagon\n\nwith the right taillight lens broken, that she would be going to\n\nDobey's motel, and that she would be in possession of about an\n\nounce of cocaine.\"        496 U.S. at 327.        The Supreme Court majority\n\ntermed the resulting question of reasonable suspicion a \"close\n\ncase.\"     Id. at 332.            The Court concluded that a reasonable\n\nsuspicion existed largely because the tip's assertion of White's\n\ndestination had been \"significantly corroborated,\" id. at 331, and\n\nbecause the tip demonstrated \"the caller's ability to predict\n\n[White's] future behavior\" and \"a special familiarity with [her]\n\naffairs,\" id. at 332.             Given all the circumstances, the Court\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\freasoned, the anonymous tip in White bore sufficient \"indicia of\n\nreliability\" to justify a Terry stop.\n\n            The third and most recent Supreme Court case dealing with\n\ntips in the context of Terry stops is Florida v. J.L., 529 U.S. 266\n\n(2000).    In J.L., \"an anonymous caller reported to the Miami-Dade\n\nPolice that a young black male standing at a particular bus stop\n\nand wearing a plaid shirt was carrying a gun.\"        Id. at 268.   The\n\npolice arrived and found a young man matching that description.\n\nThe Supreme Court concluded that the mere fact that the tip\n\nidentified a specific person and alleged possession of a gun did\n\nnot provide \"indicia of reliability of the kind contemplated in\n\nAdams and White.\"       Id. at 274.      An anonymous tip not properly\n\ncorroborated, the Court concluded, \"does not justify a [Terry]\n\nstop.\"    Id.\n\n            The defendant argues that the tip here was anonymous and\n\nuncorroborated (like the tip in J.L.).        The government avers that\n\nthe tip was neither truly anonymous (and so somewhat comparable to\n\nthe tip in Adams) and that the tip was corroborated (like the tip\n\nin White).      Our analysis takes two parts.   We explain i) that the\n\ntip in this case, whether or not it can rightly bear the technical\n\nmoniker \"anonymous,\"8 was akin to the anonymous tips analyzed by\n\n\n     8\n       There are differing views on whether the police must\nnormally treat as anonymous a hearsay tip, received from a known\nindividual, that an unnamed third party has witnessed a crime.\nCompare United States v. Fernandez-Castillo, 324 F.3d 1114, 1117-18\n(9th Cir. 2003) (finding tip non-anonymous where state highway\n                                  -11-\n\fthe Supreme Court in J.L. and White in that it could not provide\n\nreasonable suspicion unless corroborated; and ii) that because, as\n\nin J.L. and unlike in White, it was not sufficiently corroborated,\n\nthe tip could not, by itself, provide reasonable suspicion for the\n\nvehicle stop.\n\n           i.   The Tip Itself\n\n           The government contends that the hearsay tip in this case\n\nwas more reliable than the anonymous tip analyzed in J.L. because\n\nof the police officers' interactions with Cabral, and because\n\nCabral was able to report a crime supposedly witnessed by his\n\nunnamed relative.\n\n           Certain of the government's arguments have superficial\n\nappeal.   More so than in J.L., the police here had some limited\n\nmeans of narrowing the class of people who might have provided the\n\ntip.   See J.L. at 270 (noting danger when informant cannot \"be held\n\nresponsible\" for false information).    And Cabral's description of\n\n\n\ndepartment reported to police that unnamed highway department\nworker had witnessed erratic driving); and United States v. Tucker,\n305 F.3d 1193 (10th Cir. 2002) (finding tip non-anonymous where\ngovernment employee reported to the police that her former\ncoworkers at another government agency had observed one of their\ncoworkers viewing child pornography); with Ferdandez-Castillo, 324\nF.3d at 1126-27 (Ferguson, J., dissenting) (arguing that J.L.\ncontrolled); and Commonwealth v. Barros, 755 N.E.2d 740, 745 n.7\n(Mass. 2001) (explaining that J.L. does not distinguish among types\nof anonymous informants).     Because the circumstances here are\nsomewhat unusual, we decline to analyze hearsay tips from unnamed\ninformants in the abstract and focus on the specific tip in this\ncase.\n\n                                 -12-\n\fhis relative's report provided some small measure of context for\n\nthe information that may not have been present if, as in J.L., the\n\npolice had received a bare tip, out of the blue, alleging the same\n\nfacts.9\n\n          Contrary to the government's suggestion, however, the tip\n\nin this case bears some important badges of unreliability not\n\npresent in the cases relied upon by the government.        First, there\n\nis the hearsay problem.    While the police or a 911 operator often\n\ncan make some rough judgments about the age, cognitive ability, and\n\nmotivations of an anonymous informant based on her tone of voice\n\n(if the tip occurs via the telephone), or appearance and demeanor\n\n(if the tip is delivered in person even by a complete stranger),\n\nthe police here had no way of knowing the state of mind of Cabral's\n\nrelative when she gave her information, or whether she was a person\n\nwho could be relied on to relate events accurately.       In cases where\n\nuncorroborated   hearsay   tips    have   been   deemed    reliable   in\n\ncontributing to reasonable suspicion, there has been a stronger\n\nindication that the informant can be trusted.     In Tucker, 305 F.3d\n\nat 1196, and in Fernandez-Castillo, 324 F.3d at 1116, for instance,\n\n\n\n     9\n       Still, while the government analogizes to cases in which a\nperson tells the police about things he has seen himself, this is\nsimply not a case where the police received a \"personal\nobservation\" or \"first-hand account\" of a crime. Cabral, from whom\nthe police received the tip, had not observed anything on Shirley\nStreet. See United States v. Cochran, 896 F.2d 635, 641 (1st Cir.\n1990) (contrasting \"personal observation\" with \"hearsay\"); see also\nUnited States v. Greenburg, 410 F.3d 63, 67 (1st Cir. 2005).\n                                  -13-\n\fthe police knew that the unnamed hearsay informant was a government\n\nemployee.\n\n            Second, there was a higher risk of fabrication here. The\n\nJ.L. Court deemed anonymous tips inherently unreliable largely\n\nbecause such tips carry with them a risk of fabrication by the\n\ninformant.    See J.L., 529 U.S. at 271.    The hearsay tip in this\n\ncase provided two distinct opportunities for fabrication.    The tip\n\nwas suspect 1) because Cabral may have had a motive to get a rival\n\ngang member into trouble with the law and could have fabricated\n\nboth the Shirley Street shooting and the supposed communication\n\nfrom his relative, and 2) because even if Cabral was honest in his\n\ninteractions with the police, his unnamed relative may have had her\n\nown motive for fabricating incriminating evidence about a rival\n\ngang member whom she may have suspected of harboring ill will\n\ntowards a member of her family.10   There is no indication in any of\n\nthe cases cited by the government that either a hearsay informant\n\n\n     10\n        The government emphasizes Coyne's ability to observe\nCabral's demeanor as he related the tip from his relative, and\nhence to evaluate the possibility that Cabral was fabricating that\ntip. These observations, however, did not address the possibility\nthat the unnamed relative had fabricated the tip. The tip from\nCabral's relative simply cannot be deemed more reliable by virtue\nof Cabral's face-to-face interaction with the police.       Compare\nJ.L., 529 U.S. at 276 (Kennedy, J., concurring). See also Adams,\n407 U.S. at 146-47 (distinguishing known face-to-face informant\nfrom anonymous phone tipper); United States v. Romain, 393 F.3d 63,\n73-74 (1st Cir. 2004) (distinguishing J.L. in a case where the\npolice had face-to-face encounters with an unnamed informant that\nallowed them to gauge her reliability and because her appearance\nwas known and she could be recognized and \"held accountable\" for\nthe information she had provided).\n                                -14-\n\for a party relaying a hearsay tip to the police had so obvious a\n\nmotive to lie as existed in this case.\n\n             Finally, crucially, and unlike in J.L., the police had\n\nspecific reasons to doubt the tip by the time they made their stop.\n\nIn   J.L.,    \"there   [were]    no     factors    that      cast   doubt    on   the\n\nreliability of the tip.\"        529 U.S. at 271.        In this case, there was\n\nno physical evidence of gunfire on Shirley Street (as there usually\n\nwas after shootings in the neighborhood).                 No one had called the\n\npolice to complain (usually neighborhood residents called 911 upon\n\nhearing gunfire).      While officers in the city were alerted to be on\n\nthe lookout, none saw Rodrigues or his car in the hours after the\n\npurported shooting or remembered seeing the car in the area of the\n\npurported shooting earlier that day.                   The government does not\n\nsuggest, moreover, that in the week after the hearsay tip, the\n\ntipster or Cabral came forward with additional information; that\n\nany other witnesses to a Shirley Street shooting were found; or\n\nthat physical evidence of a shooting or unexplained gunshot wounds\n\nin local hospitals emerged.           When an initial police investigation\n\ninto a tip of illegal activity reveals factors inconsistent with\n\nthe tip, the reasonable suspicion analysis must take these indicia\n\nof   unreliability      into    account        along    with    any   indicia     of\n\nreliability.     See Adams, 407 U.S. at 147; see also Terry, 392 U.S.\n\nat 30; Brent v. Ashley, 247 F.3d 1294, 1303 (11th Cir. 2001).\n\nHere,   the    investigation      the     police       had   conducted      actually\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\fundermined the tip's reliability.\n\n          ii.     Corroboration\n\n          The fact that the license plate number mentioned in the\n\ntip led to Rodrigues provides a solid means of identification, but\n\nit does not corroborate the tip's assertion that there had been a\n\nshooting on Shirley Street.       When police officers stop a person in\n\nreliance on a tip, \"reasonable suspicion . . . requires that a tip\n\nbe reliable in its assertion of illegality, not just in its\n\ntendency to identify a determinate person.\" J.L., 529 U.S. at 272.\n\nThe positive identification of Rodrigues did nothing to bolster the\n\ntip's \"assertion of illegality.\"       Id.\n\n          The government also argues that Rodrigues's recent arrest\n\nand reputation as a gang member provided corroboration for the tip.\n\nWhile \"knowledge of a person's prior criminal involvement (to say\n\nnothing of a mere arrest) is alone insufficient to give rise to the\n\nrequisite reasonable suspicion,\" United States v. Sandoval, 29 F.3d\n\n537, 542 (10th Cir. 1994) (collecting cases); see also United\n\nStates v. Jerez, 108 F.3d 684, 693 (7th Cir. 1997), there may be\n\nTerry-stop cases in which corroboration comes in part from an\n\nindividual's gang affiliation and/or recent arrests for conduct\n\nrelated to the activity referred to in a tip.         Criminal history\n\ncertainly can be considered in a reasonable suspicion analysis.\n\nSee United States v. Daoust, 916 F.2d 757, 759 (1st Cir. 1990)\n\n(Breyer, C.J.).     And cases in other circuits have recognized that\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\fa history of crime and gang involvement can corroborate other\n\nevidence to establish reasonable suspicion that criminal conduct\n\nhas occurred or is occurring.           See United States v. Feliciano, 45\n\nF.3d 1070, 1074 (7th Cir. 1995) (Posner, J.) (holding that police\n\nofficer's knowledge that search subject was \"a gang member recently\n\nreleased from prison,\" combined with observations and citizen\n\ncomplaint suggesting that subject had just attempted to mug a\n\npasserby   and    might    do    so     again,    contributed    to    reasonable\n\nsuspicion).      As the Feliciano court recognized, an individual's\n\naffiliation with a violent gang and prior criminal conduct may be\n\nprobative of the likelihood that he has or is about to complete\n\nanother, similar crime.         Id.\n\n           But,    here,   the        officers'   awareness     of    Rodrigues's\n\ninvolvement in gang activity and his prior arrest is not linked to\n\nany reliable information about criminal activity on Shirley Street.\n\nIn the cases the government relies upon, courts have found that an\n\nindividual's criminal history corroborated reliable information,\n\nsuch as a police officer's own observations, in constituting\n\nreasonable suspicion. In United States v. Christmas, 222 F.3d 141,\n\n143-45 (4th Cir. 2000), the police conducted a Terry stop of a man\n\nthey knew to be a convicted criminal, after receiving a face-to-\n\nface complaint by the man's neighbor, who risked retaliation for\n\nasking the police to intervene, and viewing objective indications\n\nof ongoing criminality.         In Feliciano, it was the police officers'\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\fown observations of suspicious activity that led them to follow and\n\nidentify the individual they stopped.            45 F.3d at 1074.      In these\n\ncases, the police officers observed conduct indicating that an\n\nindividual was engaged in criminal behavior, and their knowledge of\n\nthe individual's criminal history helped to dispel any likelihood\n\nthat the observed conduct actually was innocent.11 Here, the danger\n\nwas that no criminal activity had occurred on Shirley Street at\n\nall.12        Given the objective indications that there had been no\n\nShirley Street shooting, Rodrigues's arrest and reputation are, at\n\nbest,        only   a   minimal   indication   that   the   criminal   activity\n\ncomplained of in the hearsay tip had occurred.\n\n                Where \"a tip has a relatively low degree of reliability,\n\nmore information will be required to establish the requisite\n\nquantum of suspicion than would be required if the tip were more\n\n\n        11\n       The government also cites United States v. Mitchell, 256\nF.3d 734 (7th Cir. 2001).     In that case, the police responded\nwithin 90 seconds to an anonymous report of a shooting and found\nthe defendant, who matched the description of the shooter. The\npolice asked the defendant a question and then, after observing\nhis behavior and realizing that he was a convicted felon known for\nhis violence, conducted a Terry stop because they feared that they\nwould be shot in the back if they proceeded without patting the\ndefendant down. Id. at 737. The government does not suggest any\nsimilar justification for the stop in this case.\n     12\n       The situation here also is far different from one in which\nan anonymous tipster accurately forecasts another individual's \"not\neasily predicted movements\" in a manner that confirms the tipster's\nknowledge of the subject's criminal intentions. J.L., 529 U.S. at\n269 (internal quotation marks omitted). In this case, nothing the\npolice learned after the tip falls into the category of information\nthat could \"not easily [be] predicted\" by a tipster intending to\nmislead the police.\n                                       -18-\n\freliable.\"    White, 496 U.S. at 330.            See also 4 LaFave, supra, at\n\n589 (reasoning that a tip with \"lesser 'indicia of reliability'\"\n\nprovides     reasonable       suspicion     \"only      when   other    facts        and\n\ncircumstances indicate no substantial risk of fabrication\"). Here,\n\nas in White, the tip could not be deemed reliable in and of itself.\n\nCompare Adams, 407 U.S. at 144-47 (evaluating a tip from a \"known\"\n\nindividual, who had \"provided [] information in the past\").                        And,\n\nas in J.L., even with the minimally corroborative factors cited by\n\nthe government, the police had uncovered nothing of importance that\n\ncould   indicate    the   reliability       of   the    hearsay   tip.        To    the\n\ncontrary, the initial police investigation did more to discredit\n\nthe hearsay tip than to corroborate it.              Compare White, 496 U.S. at\n\n331-32 (concluding that tipster's \"honest[y]\" and \"inform[ation]\"\n\nwere corroborated when informant \"demonstrated . . . a special\n\nfamiliarity with the [stopped individual's] affairs\").                   For these\n\nreasons,     we   conclude     that   the     tip    standing     by   itself       was\n\ninsufficient to provide reasonable suspicion for the March 31st\n\nvehicle stop.\n\nB.    The Totality of the Circumstances on March 31st\n\n            The government argues that even if it was insufficient by\n\nitself, the hearsay tip, evaluated in light of Rodrigues's arrest\n\nand   reputation    as    a   gang    member,       when   combined    with     other\n\ncircumstances -- the Eastman Street shooting and the \"ongoing gang\n\nwarfare\" -- justified the vehicle stop.                We disagree.\n\n\n                                       -19-\n\f           First, what happened (and did not happen) in the week\n\nbetween the hearsay tip and the stop reduced the weight that the\n\ntip could carry in the reasonable suspicion analysis.   In Hensley,\n\nwhich also involved an investigatory stop conducted several days\n\nafter a crime, the Supreme Court indicated that the reasonable\n\nsuspicion analysis should take into account the passage of time\n\nbetween a reported crime and a Terry stop.       The Hensley Court\n\nexplained that the \"factors in the balance\" of determining whether\n\na Terry stop is permissible, \"may be somewhat different when a stop\n\nto investigate past criminal activity is involved rather than a\n\nstop to investigate ongoing criminal conduct.\"   Hensley, 469 U.S.\n\nat 229.\n\n          This is because the governmental interests and\n          the nature of the intrusions involved in the\n          two situations may differ. . . . A stop to\n          investigate an already completed crime does\n          not necessarily promote the interest of crime\n          prevention   as   directly   as   a  stop   to\n          investigate    suspected   ongoing    criminal\n          activity. . . .      [Additionally,] officers\n          making a stop to investigate past crimes may\n          have a wider range of opportunity to choose\n          the time and circumstances of the stop.\n\nId.   See also United States v. Hudson, 405 F.3d 425, 434-37 (6th\n\nCir. 2005) (discussing Hensley standard in the context of an\n\ninformant's tip); United States v. Quarles, 330 F.3d 650, 653-56\n\n(4th Cir. 2003) (same); 4 LaFave, supra, at 288 (noting that Terry\n\nstops to investigate past criminal activity \"require somewhat\n\ndifferent analysis\").\n\n\n                               -20-\n\f           As we indicated above, by the time the stop occurred, a\n\nfull week after the hearsay tip, the police had investigated the\n\ntip and found no corroboration, excluding Rodrigues's reputation\n\nand his arrest three weeks earlier, that a Shirley Street shooting\n\nhad occurred.         Questionable Terry stops may become even less\n\nreasonable if \"the police have had the time to develop\" better\n\ngrounds for the stop but have failed to do so.             United States v.\n\nHudson, 405 F.3d 425, 437 (6th Cir. 2005) (explaining that Hensley\n\nincorporates an expectation that police will make efforts to\n\ninvestigate crimes, and that \"courts will hold the police to this\n\nexpectation in appropriate cases\").         By March 31st, the tip could\n\nprovide only a marginal benefit to the government in a reasonable\n\nsuspicion analysis.\n\n           Similarly, while there may be a rationale for according\n\nspecial weight to anonymous tips in cases of an imminent threat to\n\npublic safety, there was no imminent threat in this case.                     See\n\nJ.L., 529 U.S. at 273-74 (recognizing that in some cases, such as\n\n\"a report of a person carrying a bomb,\" \"the danger alleged in an\n\nanonymous tip may be so great as to justify a search without a\n\nshowing of reliability\").        True, if the vehicle stop had occurred\n\nimmediately after the tip on March 25th, and before any opportunity\n\nfor   investigation,     the   government   might   have   argued      that   an\n\nimminent threat existed -- facing two reported shootings, the\n\npolice   may   have    had   legitimate   reasons   to   fear   that   another\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\fshooting might soon occur.      But the police did not report any\n\nreason to suspect that Rodrigues and his car posed a danger on\n\nMarch 31st, and the government does not argue that there was any\n\nsuch reason.   The lack of any indication of an immediate threat to\n\nthe public also differentiates this case from many in which a stop\n\nhas been based on a corroborated anonymous tip of ongoing criminal\n\nactivity, see, e.g., United States v. Wheat, 278 F.3d 722 (8th Cir.\n\n2001) (reckless driving); State v. Walshire, 634 N.W.2d 625 (Ia.\n\n2001) (drunk driving); 4 LaFave, supra, at 596-97. In these cases,\n\nthere were strong exigent rationales for quick police action (e.g.,\n\nimminent danger to the public and loss of evidence) that are\n\naltogether absent here.\n\n            Furthermore, contrary to the government's assertion, we\n\nare   not   persuaded   that   there    were   any   other   substantial\n\n\"governmental interests,\" Hensley, 469 U.S. at 229, involved in the\n\nMarch 31st vehicle stop.        In a Terry stop to investigate a\n\ncompleted crime, there normally is either a reasonable suspicion\n\nthat the person stopped is the known individual wanted for a crime\n\nthat is known to have occurred, see, e.g., Hensley, 469 U.S. at\n\n224 (police department had issued \"wanted flyer\" for driver) or a\n\nreasonable suspicion that the stop will uncover evidence of a\n\nrecently-committed crime, see, e.g., United States v. Tilmon, 19\n\nF.3d 1221, 1225 (7th Cir. 1994) (\"exact match\" of subject and his\n\ncar to those described as involved in bank robbery two hours\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\fearlier).       Some of these rationales might plausibly have been\n\narticulated if Coyne and Griffiths had seen and stopped Rodrigues\n\non March 25th, before there was time for any investigation and\n\nshortly after the purported Shirley Street shooting was supposed to\n\nhave taken place. (At that point, for instance, the officers might\n\nhave expected to detect fleeting physical evidence of a recent\n\nshooting, such as a hot gun, gunpowder residue, or the odor of\n\ngunpowder on Rodrigues's person.)             But none of these rationales\n\napplies to the March 31st stop.\n\n            This also might have been a different case if the police\n\nhad demonstrated that they had no better way to question Rodrigues\n\na week after the purported crime on Shirley Street.                      We can\n\nenvision    circumstances     where    a     Terry   stop   to    investigate   a\n\ncompleted crime may be justified in part because the police have\n\nsearched for a suspect in all his usual haunts but failed to find\n\nhim.    In those circumstances, a suspect's unusual absence may be\n\nprobative of an effort to elude the police and an articulable\n\nindication of specific past criminal activity.                   But there is no\n\nevidence that this was such a case.\n\n            In the end, the police had little more reason to suspect\n\nRodrigues of specific criminal activity on March 31st than they did\n\nbefore receiving the hearsay tip.            The police suspected Rodrigues\n\nof being affiliated with a gang and knew of his recent arrest.                And\n\nthe    police   knew   that   there   had     been   gang   violence     in   the\n\n\n                                      -23-\n\fneighborhood.   But the government does not suggest that the police\n\nhad   information   tying   Rodrigues,   personally,   to   any   of   this\n\nviolence.    The only possible crime to which the police could tie\n\nRodrigues -- the Shirley Street shooting -- was one that appeared,\n\nin all likelihood, never to have occurred.      After considering all\n\nof the circumstances relevant to the March 31st stop, we conclude\n\nthat the district court correctly suppressed the evidence derived\n\ntherefrom.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -24-\n\f",

The target of the shooting, who escaped unharmed, was Antonio Cabral. The police knew that Cabral was associated with a gang and that his gang and its rival had been involved in a series of shootings. At the scene on Eastman Street, patrol officers James Coyne and Thomas Griffiths spoke with Cabral for about an hour. Cabral reported that two men had shot at him through a fence, while he was standing in his driveway. Cabral said he had no knowledge of the identity of the shooters, but another person who had been nearby told the police that a red Mazda had raced away from Eastman Street shortly after the shooting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At around 8:00 P.M. that evening, Coyne and Griffiths returned to Eastman Street and interviewed Cabral again. This time, Cabral's mother and brother were present. Cabral again said he had no information for the police. The Cabrals complained that the police \"weren't doing enough in the community to stop the violence.\" Coyne responded that the police could do more if neighborhood residents would \"give us information for us to solve these shootings.\" Cabral then said that he had no information to offer about his own shooting but that he had information about another shooting that same day. Cabral said that a relative told him that she had witnessed gunfire on Shirley Street from two cars, a red Mazda and a red Honda with license plate 5021EV. Coyne asked Cabral who the relative was. Coyne understood Cabral to indicate that the relative was female, but Cabral refused to give her name or any other information about her. The police made no further attempts to identify or locate the unnamed relative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That same evening, Coyne and Griffiths drove to Shirley Street and looked for some evidence of gunfire, such as spent shell casings or bullet damage. They found none. The officers also searched the police department's records to see if anybody had reported gunfire on Shirley Street. No one had. Coyne later testified at the suppression hearing that it was typical for shootings in the neighborhood to be reported to 911, and for obvious evidence of gunfire to be found at the scene.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coyne ran the 5021EV license plate number through the vehicle registration database and matched the plates to a red Honda belonging to Marcelino Rodrigues. Coyne was familiar with Rodrigues and suspected that he was affiliated with a gang that was a rival to Cabral's. Coyne also knew that Rodrigues had been arrested three weeks earlier in Randolph, Massachusetts, on a firearms possession charge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Coyne and Griffiths went to the address Rodrigues had listed on his vehicle registration, but Rodrigues was not there. That night, the officers looked for Rodrigues around the neighborhood but did not find him. Coyne and Griffiths radioed other officers in the area to be on the lookout for Rodrigues and the red Honda, but no one saw Rodrigues or his car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A full week passed during which the police apparently conducted no further investigation of the possible shooting on Shirley Street. Then, on March 31st, Coyne, Griffiths, and a third officer were conducting a traffic stop when they saw Rodrigues and two passengers drive by. The officers rushed to their cars, pursued Rodrigues, and pulled him over for \"field interrogation and observation.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> There was no traffic violation or suspicious activity. The defendant was one of Rodrigues's passengers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although this appeal is limited to the legality of the initial vehicle stop, we relate briefly what happened thereafter. The officers ordered Rodrigues and his passengers to step out of the car. The third officer, who was not available to testify at the suppression hearing, told Coyne that he had seen a gun in the center console of the car.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The police then handcuffed Rodrigues and his passengers and, upon obtaining a search warrant, searched the car and recovered two guns. These guns comprise the evidence at issue in this appeal. At the scene, the police questioned Rodrigues about the purported Shirley Street shooting and about the attempted shooting of Cabral on Eastman Street. Rodrigues denied involvement in either event.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequently, the state and federal governments indicted the defendant on a variety of charges. In both prosecutions, the defendant sought to suppress evidence gathered in connection with the March 31st stop of Rodrigues's car.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The district court held a two-day evidentiary hearing and issued a thoughtful order. The court concluded: \"While this is a borderline case, once the tip [of a shooting on Shirley Street] proved to be unreliable, the hunch [that Rodrigues was involved in criminal activity] was not enough to establish a reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity sufficient to stop the red Honda.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sole question in this interlocutory appeal is whether the police acted reasonably in stopping Rodrigues and his passengers on March 31st. Because only the district court's ultimate Fourth Amendment conclusion is at issue, our review is <i>de novo. United States v. Paradis,</i> 351 F.3d 21, 24 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a police officer makes \"brief investigatory stops of persons and vehicles that fall short of traditional arrest. . . the Fourth Amendment is satisfied if the officer's action is supported by reasonable suspicion that criminal activity may be afoot,\" <i>United States v. Arvizu,</i> 534 U.S. 266, 273, 122 S.Ct. 744, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted), or if there is \"reasonable suspicion, grounded in specific and articulable facts, that [the stopped] person . . . was involved in or is wanted in connection with a completed felony,\" <i>United States v. Hensley,</i> 469 U.S. 221, 229, 105 S.Ct. 675, 83 L.Ed.2d 604 (1985). In evaluating whether reasonable suspicion existed, we \"look at the totality of the circumstances of each case to see whether the detaining officer ha[d] a particularized and objective basis for suspecting legal wrongdoing.\" <i>Arvizu,</i> 534 U.S. at 273, 122 S.Ct. 744 (internal quotation marks omitted). The government bears the burden of showing such a basis. <i>See Florida v. Royer,</i> 460 U.S. 491, 500, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 75 L.Ed.2d 229 (1983) (plurality opinion); <i>Brown v. Texas,</i> 443 U.S. 47, 52, 99 S.Ct. 2637, 61 L.Ed.2d 357 (1979). We allow police officers \"to draw on their own experience and specialized training\" in making a vehicle stop. <i>Arvizu,</i> 534 U.S. at 273, 122 S.Ct. 744. But the reasonable suspicion standard imposes meaningful limits on temporary detentions. \"[A]n officer's reliance on a mere `hunch' is insufficient to justify a stop.\" <i>Id.</i> at 274, 122 S.Ct. 744 (quoting <i>Terry v. Ohio,</i> 392 U.S. 1, 27, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the defendant was neither the driver of the vehicle stopped on March 31st nor then the subject of police suspicion, he was seized when the police stopped Rodrigues's car. Consequently, he has the right to contest the legality of that stop. <i>See United States v. Woodrum,</i> 202 F.3d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government contends that the totality of the circumstances known to the police provided adequate justification for the March 31st vehicle stop. In its briefs, the government suggests that the police may have suspected Rodrigues of three types of wrongdoing: the purported shooting on Shirley Street; the attempted shooting of Cabral on Eastman Street; and ongoing involvement in what the government terms \"gang warfare.\" However, the government conceded at oral argument that there is \"no\" information in the record tying Rodrigues or his car to \"involvement in the Eastman Street shooting.\" (Coyne had said essentially the same while testifying at the suppression hearing.) Furthermore, while the police suspected Rodrigues of being a gang member, the government does not contend that there was any reason to suspect that Rodrigues and his passengers were involved in criminal activity when the stop took place on March 31st, or that they were about to be so involved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government does argue that the police had a reasonable suspicion, grounded in specific and articulable facts, that Rodrigues had committed a crime on Shirley Street on March 25th. (Coyne testified that investigation of this purported crime was his actual motivation in stopping the Honda on March 31st.)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The tip from Cabral's unidentified relative is the focus of the government's argument. Therefore, in section A, we evaluate the appropriate place in the reasonable suspicion analysis i) of that tip and ii) of the factors that the government argues corroborated it. We conclude that the minimally corroborated tip did not alone provide reasonable suspicion for a vehicle stop on March 31st. In section B, we consider the tip and its minimal corroboration with the other information known to the police on March 31st. We conclude that the totality of the circumstances, including the tip, did not provide reasonable suspicion to stop the car on March 31st.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Tip From Cabral's Relative</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only indication that a shooting actually had occurred on Shirley Street was the hearsay statement of Cabral's unnamed relative, as relayed to the police by Cabral. Three Supreme Court cases provide the basic parameters for determining whether an informant's tip provides reasonable suspicion for a <i>Terry</i> stop. The first of these cases is <i>Adams v. Williams,</i> 407 U.S. 143, 92 S.Ct. 1921, 32 L.Ed.2d 612 (1972). In <i>Adams,</i> the Supreme Court concluded that a police officer was warranted in conducting a <i>Terry</i> stop on the basis of an in-person tip from a \"person known to him\" that a man \"seated in a nearby vehicle [in a high-crime area] was carrying narcotics and had a gun at his waist.\" <i>Id.</i> at 144-45, 92 S.Ct. 1921. The Court so held in large part because the informant was known personally to the police officer, and \"had provided him with information in the past,\" and because the informant would be subject to prosecution for supplying false information to the police. <i>Id.</i> at 146, 92 S.Ct. 1921. As a leading, academic commentator on the Fourth Amendment has written, <i>Adams</i> makes clear that \"suspicious circumstances reported to the police by a reliable [known] person in a nonconclusory fashion\" may in certain circumstances be sufficient to warrant a <i>Terry</i> stop. 4 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure 576 (4th ed.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Anonymous tips are a different matter. The second relevant Supreme Court case, <i>Alabama v. White,</i> 496 U.S. 325, 110 S.Ct. 2412, 110 L.Ed.2d 301 (1990), involved an anonymous telephone call to the police, which stated \"that Vanessa White would be leaving 235-C Lynwood Terrace Apartments at a particular time in a brown Plymouth station wagon with the right taillight lens broken, that she would be going to Dobey's motel, and that she would be in possession of about an ounce of cocaine.\" 496 U.S. at 327, 110 S.Ct. 2412. The Supreme Court majority termed the resulting question of reasonable suspicion a \"close case.\" <i>Id.</i> at 332, 110 S.Ct. 2412. The Court concluded that a reasonable suspicion existed largely because the tip's assertion of White's destination had been \"significantly corroborated,\" <i>id.</i> at 331, 110 S.Ct. 2412, and because the tip demonstrated \"the caller's ability to predict [White's] future behavior\" and \"a special familiarity with [her] affairs,\" <i>id.</i> at 332, 110 S.Ct. 2412. Given all the circumstances, the Court reasoned, the anonymous tip in <i>White</i> bore sufficient \"indicia of reliability\" to justify a <i>Terry</i> stop.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third and most recent Supreme Court case dealing with tips in the context of <i>Terry</i> stops is <i>Florida v. J.L.,</i> 529 U.S. 266, 120 S.Ct. 1375, 146 L.Ed.2d 254 (2000). In <i>J.L.,</i> \"an anonymous caller reported to the Miami-Dade Police that a young black male standing at a particular bus stop and wearing a plaid shirt was carrying a gun.\" <i>Id.</i> at 268, 120 S.Ct. 1375. The police arrived and found a young man matching that description. The Supreme Court concluded that the mere fact that the tip identified a specific person and alleged possession of a gun did not provide \"indicia of reliability of the kind contemplated in <i>Adams</i> and <i>White.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> at 274, 120 S.Ct. 1375. An anonymous tip not properly corroborated, the Court concluded, \"does not justify a [<i>Terry</i>] stop.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant argues that the tip here was anonymous and uncorroborated (like the tip in <i>J.L.</i>). The government avers that the tip was neither truly anonymous (and so somewhat comparable to the tip in <i>Adams</i>) and that the tip was corroborated (like the tip in <i>White</i>). Our analysis takes two parts. We explain i) that the tip in this case, whether or not it can rightly bear the technical moniker \"anonymous,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> was akin to the anonymous tips analyzed by the Supreme Court in <i>J.L.</i> and <i>White</i> in that it could not provide reasonable suspicion unless corroborated; and ii) that because, as in <i>J.L.</i> and unlike in <i>White,</i> it was not sufficiently corroborated, the tip could not, by itself, provide reasonable suspicion for the vehicle stop.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">i. The Tip Itself</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government contends that the hearsay tip in this case was more reliable than the anonymous tip analyzed in <i>J.L.</i> because of the police officers' interactions with Cabral, and because Cabral was able to report a crime supposedly witnessed by his unnamed relative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certain of the government's arguments have superficial appeal. More so than in <i>J.L.,</i> the police here had some limited means of narrowing the class of people who might have provided the tip. <i>See J.L.</i> at 270, 120 S.Ct. 1375 (noting danger when informant cannot \"be held responsible\" for false information). And Cabral's description of his relative's report provided some small measure of context for the information that may not have been present if, as in <i>J.L.,</i> the police had received a bare tip, out of the blue, alleging the same facts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to the government's suggestion, however, the tip in this case bears some important badges of unreliability not present in the cases relied upon by the government. First, there is the hearsay problem. While the police or a 911 operator often can make some rough judgments about the age, cognitive ability, and motivations of an anonymous informant based on her tone of voice (if the tip occurs via the telephone), or appearance and demeanor (if the tip is delivered in person even by a complete stranger), the police here had no way of knowing the state of mind of Cabral's relative when she gave her information, or whether she was a person who could be relied on to relate events accurately. In cases where uncorroborated hearsay tips have been deemed reliable in contributing to reasonable suspicion, there has been a stronger indication that the informant can be trusted. In <i>Tucker,</i> 305 F.3d at 1196, and in <i>Fernandez-Castillo,</i> 324 F.3d at 1116, for instance, the police knew that the unnamed hearsay informant was a government employee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, there was a higher risk of fabrication here. The <i>J.L.</i> Court deemed anonymous tips inherently unreliable largely because such tips carry with them a risk of fabrication by the informant. <i>See J.L.,</i> 529 U.S. at 271, 120 S.Ct. 1375. The hearsay tip in this case provided two distinct opportunities for fabrication. The tip was suspect 1) because Cabral may have had a motive to get a rival gang member into trouble with the law and could have fabricated both the Shirley Street shooting and the supposed communication from his relative, and 2) because even if Cabral was honest in his interactions with the police, his unnamed relative may have had her own motive for fabricating incriminating evidence about a rival gang member whom she may have suspected of harboring ill will towards a member of her family.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> There is no indication in any of the cases cited by the government that either a hearsay informant or a party relaying a hearsay tip to the police had so obvious a motive to lie as existed in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, crucially, and unlike in <i>J.L.,</i> the police had specific reasons to doubt the tip by the time they made their stop. In <i>J.L.,</i> \"there [were] no factors that cast doubt on the reliability of the tip.\" 529 U.S. at 271, 120 S.Ct. 1375. In this case, there was no physical evidence of gunfire on Shirley Street (as there usually was after shootings in the neighborhood). No one had called the police to complain (usually neighborhood residents called 911 upon hearing gunfire). While officers in the city were alerted to be on the lookout, none saw Rodrigues or his car in the hours after the purported shooting or remembered seeing the car in the area of the purported shooting earlier that day. The government does not suggest, moreover, that in the week after the hearsay tip, the tipster or Cabral came forward with additional information; that any other witnesses to a Shirley Street shooting were found; or that physical evidence of a shooting or unexplained gunshot wounds in local hospitals emerged. When an initial police investigation into a tip of illegal activity reveals factors inconsistent with the tip, the reasonable suspicion analysis must take these indicia of unreliability into account along with any indicia of reliability. <i>See Adams,</i> 407 U.S. at 147, 92 S.Ct. 1921; <i>see also Terry,</i> 392 U.S. at 30, 88 S.Ct. 1868; <i>Brent v. Ashley,</i> 247 F.3d 1294, 1303 (11th Cir.2001). Here, the investigation the police had conducted actually undermined the tip's reliability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ii. Corroboration</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that the license plate number mentioned in the tip led to Rodrigues provides a solid means of identification, but it does not corroborate the tip's assertion that there had been a shooting on Shirley Street. When police officers stop a person in reliance on a tip, \"reasonable suspicion . . . requires that a tip be reliable in its assertion of illegality, not just in its tendency to identify a determinate person.\" <i>J.L.,</i> 529 U.S. at 272, 120 S.Ct. 1375. The positive identification of Rodrigues did nothing to bolster the tip's \"assertion of illegality.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government also argues that Rodrigues's recent arrest and reputation as a gang member provided corroboration for the tip. While \"knowledge of a person's prior criminal involvement (to say nothing of a mere arrest) is alone insufficient to give rise to the requisite reasonable suspicion,\" <i>United States v. Sandoval,</i> 29 F.3d 537, 542 (10th Cir.1994) (collecting cases); <i>see also United States v. Jerez,</i> 108 F.3d 684, 693 (7th Cir.1997), there may be <i>Terry</i>-stop cases in which corroboration comes in part from an individual's gang affiliation and/or recent arrests for conduct related to the activity referred to in a tip. Criminal history certainly can be considered in a reasonable suspicion analysis. <i>See United States v. Daoust,</i> 916 F.2d 757, 759 (1st Cir.1990) (Breyer, C.J.). And cases in other circuits have recognized that a history of crime and gang involvement can corroborate other evidence to establish reasonable suspicion that criminal conduct has occurred or is occurring. <i>See United States v. Feliciano,</i> 45 F.3d 1070, 1074 (7th Cir.1995) (Posner, J.) (holding that police officer's knowledge that search subject was \"a gang member recently released from prison,\" combined with observations and citizen complaint suggesting that subject had just attempted to mug a passerby and might do so again, contributed to reasonable suspicion). As the <i>Feliciano</i> court recognized, an individual's affiliation with a violent gang and prior criminal conduct may be probative of the likelihood that he has or is about to complete another, similar crime. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But, here, the officers' awareness of Rodrigues's involvement in gang activity and his prior arrest is not linked to any reliable information about criminal activity on Shirley Street. In the cases the government relies upon, courts have found that an individual's criminal history corroborated reliable information, such as a police officer's own observations, in constituting reasonable suspicion. In <i>United States v. Christmas,</i> 222 F.3d 141, 143-45 (4th Cir.2000), the police conducted a <i>Terry</i> stop of a man they knew to be a convicted criminal, after receiving a face-to-face complaint by the man's neighbor, who risked retaliation for asking the police to intervene, and viewing objective indications of ongoing criminality. In <i>Feliciano,</i> it was the police officers' own observations of suspicious activity that led them to follow and identify the individual they stopped. 45 F.3d at 1074. In these cases, the police officers observed conduct indicating that an individual was engaged in criminal behavior, and their knowledge of the individual's criminal history helped to dispel any likelihood that the observed conduct actually was innocent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Here, the danger was that no criminal activity had occurred on Shirley Street at all.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Given the objective indications that there had been no Shirley Street shooting, Rodrigues's arrest and reputation are, at best, only a minimal indication that the criminal activity complained of in the hearsay tip had occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where \"a tip has a relatively low degree of reliability, more information will be required to establish the requisite quantum of suspicion than would be required if the tip were more reliable.\" <i>White,</i> 496 U.S. at 330, 110 S.Ct. 2412. <i>See also</i> 4 LaFave, <i>supra,</i> at 589 (reasoning that a tip with \"lesser `indicia of reliability'\" provides reasonable suspicion \"only when other facts and circumstances indicate no substantial risk of fabrication\"). Here, as in <i>White,</i> the tip could not be deemed reliable in and of itself. <i>Compare Adams,</i> 407 U.S. at 144-47, 92 S.Ct. 1921 (evaluating a tip from a \"known\" individual, who had \"provided [ ] information in the past\"). And, as in <i>J.L.,</i> even with the minimally corroborative factors cited by the government, the police had uncovered nothing of importance that could indicate the reliability of the hearsay tip. To the contrary, the initial police investigation did more to discredit the hearsay tip than to corroborate it. <i>Compare White,</i> 496 U.S. at 331-32, 110 S.Ct. 2412 (concluding that tipster's \"honest[y]\" and \"inform[ation]\" were corroborated when informant \"demonstrated. . . a special familiarity with the [stopped individual's] affairs\"). For these reasons, we conclude that the tip standing by itself was insufficient to provide reasonable suspicion for the March 31st vehicle stop.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The Totality of the Circumstances on March 31st</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that even if it was insufficient by itself, the hearsay tip, evaluated in light of Rodrigues's arrest and reputation as a gang member, when combined with other circumstances &#8212; the Eastman Street shooting and the \"ongoing gang warfare\" &#8212; justified the vehicle stop. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, what happened (and did not happen) in the week between the hearsay tip and the stop reduced the weight that the tip could carry in the reasonable suspicion analysis. In <i>Hensley,</i> which also involved an investigatory stop conducted several days after a crime, the Supreme Court indicated that the reasonable suspicion analysis should take into account the passage of time between a reported crime and a <i>Terry</i> stop. The <i>Hensley</i> Court explained that the \"factors in the balance\" of determining whether a <i>Terry</i> stop is permissible, \"may be somewhat different when a stop to investigate past criminal activity is involved rather than a stop to investigate ongoing criminal conduct.\" <i>Hensley,</i> 469 U.S. at 229, 105 S.Ct. 675.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is because the governmental interests and the nature of the intrusions involved in the two situations may differ. . . . A stop to investigate an already completed crime does not necessarily promote the interest of crime prevention as directly as a stop to investigate suspected ongoing criminal activity. . . . [Additionally,] officers making a stop to investigate past crimes may have a wider range of opportunity to choose the time and circumstances of the stop.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id. See also United States v. Hudson,</i> 405 F.3d 425, 434-37 (6th Cir.2005) (discussing <i>Hensley</i> standard in the context of an informant's tip); <i>United States v. Quarles,</i> 330 F.3d 650, 653-56 (4th Cir.2003) (same); 4 LaFave, <i>supra,</i> at 288 (noting that <i>Terry</i> stops to investigate past criminal activity \"require somewhat different analysis\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we indicated above, by the time the stop occurred, a full week after the hearsay tip, the police had investigated the tip and found no corroboration, excluding Rodrigues's reputation and his arrest three weeks earlier, that a Shirley Street shooting had occurred. Questionable <i>Terry</i> stops may become even less reasonable if \"the police have had the time to develop\" better grounds for the stop but have failed to do so. <i>United States v. Hudson,</i> 405 F.3d 425, 437 (6th Cir.2005) (explaining that <i>Hensley</i> incorporates an expectation that police will make efforts to investigate crimes, and that \"courts will hold the police to this expectation in appropriate cases\"). By March 31st, the tip could provide only a marginal benefit to the government in a reasonable suspicion analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, while there may be a rationale for according special weight to anonymous tips in cases of an imminent threat to public safety, there was no imminent threat in this case. <i>See J.L.,</i> 529 U.S. at 273-74, 120 S.Ct. 1375 (recognizing that in some cases, such as \"a report of a person carrying a bomb,\" \"the danger alleged in an anonymous tip may be so great as to justify a search without a showing of reliability\"). True, if the vehicle stop had occurred immediately after the tip on March 25th, and before any opportunity for investigation, the government might have argued that an imminent threat existed &#8212; facing two reported shootings, the police may have had legitimate reasons to fear that another shooting might soon occur. But the police did not report any reason to suspect that Rodrigues and his car posed a danger on March 31st, and the government does not argue that there was any such reason. The lack of any indication of an immediate threat to the public also differentiates this case from many in which a stop has been based on a corroborated anonymous tip of ongoing criminal activity, <i>see, e.g., United States v. Wheat,</i> 278 F.3d 722 (8th Cir.2001) (reckless driving); <i>State v. Walshire,</i> 634 N.W.2d 625 (Iowa 2001) (drunk driving); 4 LaFave, <i>supra,</i> at 596-97. In these cases, there were strong exigent rationales for quick police action (e.g., imminent danger to the public and loss of evidence) that are altogether absent here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, contrary to the government's assertion, we are not persuaded that there were any other substantial \"governmental interests,\" <i>Hensley,</i> 469 U.S. at 229, 105 S.Ct. 675, involved in the March 31st vehicle stop. In a <i>Terry</i> stop to investigate a completed crime, there normally is either a reasonable suspicion that the person stopped is the known individual wanted for a crime that is known to have occurred, <i>see, e.g., Hensley,</i> 469 U.S. at 224, 105 S.Ct. 675 (police department had issued \"wanted flyer\" for driver) or a reasonable suspicion that the stop will uncover evidence of a recently-committed crime, <i>see, e.g., United States v. Tilmon,</i> 19 F.3d 1221, 1225 (7th Cir.1994) (\"exact match\" of subject and his car to those described as involved in bank robbery two hours earlier). Some of these rationales might plausibly have been articulated if Coyne and Griffiths had seen and stopped Rodrigues on March 25th, before there was time for any investigation and shortly after the purported Shirley Street shooting was supposed to have taken place. (At that point, for instance, the officers might have expected to detect fleeting physical evidence of a recent shooting, such as a hot gun, gunpowder residue, or the odor of gunpowder on Rodrigues's person.) But none of these rationales applies to the March 31st stop.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This also might have been a different case if the police had demonstrated that they had no better way to question Rodrigues a week after the purported crime on Shirley Street. We can envision circumstances where a <i>Terry</i> stop to investigate a completed crime may be justified in part because the police have searched for a suspect in all his usual haunts but failed to find him. In those circumstances, a suspect's unusual absence may be probative of an effort to elude the police and an articulable indication of specific past criminal activity. But there is no evidence that this was such a case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, the police had little more reason to suspect Rodrigues of specific criminal activity on March 31st than they did before receiving the hearsay tip. The police suspected Rodrigues of being affiliated with a gang and knew of his recent arrest. And the police knew that there had been gang violence in the neighborhood. But the government does not suggest that the police had information tying Rodrigues, personally, to any of this violence. The only possible crime to which the police could tie Rodrigues &#8212; the Shirley Street shooting &#8212; was one that appeared, in all likelihood, never to have occurred. After considering all of the circumstances relevant to the March 31st stop, we conclude that the district court correctly suppressed the evidence derived therefrom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Specifically, Coyne testified that after shootings in the neighborhood:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">There would be parties outside.

Cabral, from whom the police received the tip, had not observed anything on Shirley Street<i>See United States v. Cochrane,</i> 896 F.2d 635, 641 (1st Cir.1990) (contrasting \"personal observation\" with \"hearsay\"); <i>see also United States v.

These observations, however, did not address the possibility that the unnamed relative had fabricated the tip. The tip from Cabral's relative simply cannot be deemed more reliable by virtue of Cabral's face-to-face interaction with the police<i>Compare J.L.,</i> 529 U.S. at 276, 120 S.Ct. 1375 (Kennedy, J., concurring). <i>See also Adams,</i> 407 U.S. at 146-47, 92 S.Ct. 1921 (distinguishing known face-to-face informant from anonymous phone tipper); <i>United States v.

The target of the shooting, who escaped unharmed, was Antonio Cabral. The police knew that Cabral was associated with a gang and that his gang and its rival had been involved in a series of shootings. At the scene on Eastman Street, patrol officers James Coyne and Thomas Griffiths spoke with Cabral for about an hour. Cabral reported that two men had shot at him through a fence, while he was standing in his driveway. Cabral said he had no knowledge of the identity of the shooters, but another person who had been nearby told the police that a red Mazda had raced away from Eastman Street shortly after the shooting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At around 8:00 P.M. that evening, Coyne and Griffiths returned to Eastman Street and interviewed Cabral again. This time, Cabral's mother and brother were present. Cabral again said he had no information for the police. The Cabrals complained that the police \"weren't doing enough in the community to stop the violence.\" Coyne responded that the police could do more if neighborhood residents would \"give us information for us to solve these shootings.\" Cabral then said that he had no information to offer about his own shooting but that he had information about another shooting that same day. Cabral said that a relative told him that she had witnessed gunfire on Shirley Street from two cars, a red Mazda and a red Honda with license plate 5021EV. Coyne asked Cabral who the relative was. Coyne understood Cabral to indicate that the relative was female, but Cabral refused to give her name or any other information about her. The police made no further attempts to identify or locate the unnamed relative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That same evening, Coyne and Griffiths drove to Shirley Street and looked for some evidence of gunfire, such as spent shell casings or bullet damage. They found none. The officers also searched the police department's records to see if anybody had reported gunfire on Shirley Street. No one had. Coyne later testified at the suppression hearing that it was typical for shootings in the neighborhood to be reported to 911, and for obvious evidence of gunfire to be found at the scene.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coyne ran the 5021EV license plate number through the vehicle registration database and matched the plates to a red Honda belonging to Marcelino Rodrigues. Coyne was familiar with Rodrigues and suspected that he was affiliated with a gang that was a rival to Cabral's. Coyne also knew that Rodrigues had been arrested three weeks earlier in Randolph, Massachusetts, on a firearms possession charge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Coyne and Griffiths went to the address Rodrigues had listed on his vehicle registration, but Rodrigues was not there. That night, the officers looked for Rodrigues around the neighborhood but did not find him. Coyne and Griffiths radioed other officers in the area to be on the lookout for Rodrigues and the red Honda, but no one saw Rodrigues or his car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A full week passed during which the police apparently conducted no further investigation of the possible shooting on Shirley Street. Then, on March 31st, Coyne, Griffiths, and a third officer were conducting a traffic stop when they saw Rodrigues and two passengers drive by. The officers rushed to their cars, pursued Rodrigues, and pulled him over for \"field interrogation and observation.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> There was no traffic violation or suspicious activity. The defendant was one of Rodrigues's passengers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although this appeal is limited to the legality of the initial vehicle stop, we relate briefly what happened thereafter. The officers ordered Rodrigues and his passengers to step out of the car. The third officer, who was not available to testify at the suppression hearing, told Coyne that he had seen a gun in the center console of the car.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The police then handcuffed Rodrigues and his passengers and, upon obtaining a search warrant, searched the car and recovered two guns. These guns comprise the evidence at issue in this appeal. At the scene, the police questioned Rodrigues about the purported Shirley Street shooting and about the attempted shooting of Cabral on Eastman Street. Rodrigues denied involvement in either event.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequently, the state and federal governments indicted the defendant on a variety of charges. In both prosecutions, the defendant sought to suppress evidence gathered in connection with the March 31st stop of Rodrigues's car.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The district court held a two-day evidentiary hearing and issued a thoughtful order. The court concluded: \"While this is a borderline case, once the tip [of a shooting on Shirley Street] proved to be unreliable, the hunch [that Rodrigues was involved in criminal activity] was not enough to establish a reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity sufficient to stop the red Honda.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sole question in this interlocutory appeal is whether the police acted reasonably in stopping Rodrigues and his passengers on March 31st.

In its briefs, the government suggests that the police may have suspected Rodrigues of three types of wrongdoing: the purported shooting on Shirley Street; the attempted shooting of Cabral on Eastman Street; and ongoing involvement in what the government terms \"gang warfare.\" However, the government conceded at oral argument that there is \"no\" information in the record tying Rodrigues or his car to \"involvement in the Eastman Street shooting.\" (Coyne had said essentially the same while testifying at the suppression hearing.) Furthermore, while the police suspected Rodrigues of being a gang member, the government does not contend that there was any reason to suspect that Rodrigues and his passengers were involved in criminal activity when the stop took place on March 31st, or that they were about to be so involved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government does argue that the police had a reasonable suspicion, grounded in specific and articulable facts, that Rodrigues had committed a crime on Shirley Street on March 25th.

Therefore, in section A, we evaluate the appropriate place in the reasonable suspicion analysis i) of that tip and ii) of the factors that the government argues corroborated it. We conclude that the minimally corroborated tip did not alone provide reasonable suspicion for a vehicle stop on March 31st. In section B, we consider the tip and its minimal corroboration with the other information known to the police on March 31st. We conclude that the totality of the circumstances, including the tip, did not provide reasonable suspicion to stop the car on March 31st.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Tip From Cabral's Relative</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only indication that a shooting actually had occurred on Shirley Street was the hearsay statement of Cabral's unnamed relative, as relayed to the police by Cabral. Three Supreme Court cases provide the basic parameters for determining whether an informant's tip provides reasonable suspicion for a <i>Terry</i> stop. The first of these cases is <i>Adams v. Williams,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108571\"><a href=\"/opinion/108571/adams-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">143</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108571\"><a href=\"/opinion/108571/adams-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">612</span></a></span> (1972). In <i>Adams,</i> the Supreme Court concluded that a police officer was warranted in conducting a <i>Terry</i> stop on the basis of an in-person tip from a \"person known to him\" that a man \"seated in a nearby vehicle [in a high-crime area] was carrying narcotics and had a gun at his waist.\" <i>Id.</i> at 144-45, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108571\"><a href=\"/opinion/108571/adams-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1921</span></a></span>. The Court so held in large part because the informant was known personally to the police officer, and \"had provided him with information in the past,\" and because the informant would be subject to prosecution for supplying false information to the police. <i>Id.</i> at 146, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108571\"><a href=\"/opinion/108571/adams-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1921</span></a></span>. As a leading, academic commentator on the Fourth Amendment has written, <i>Adams</i> makes clear that \"suspicious circumstances reported to the police by a reliable [known] person in a nonconclusory fashion\" may in certain circumstances be sufficient to warrant a <i>Terry</i> stop. 4 W.

An anonymous tip not properly corroborated, the Court concluded, \"does not justify a [<i>Terry</i>] stop.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant argues that the tip here was anonymous and uncorroborated (like the tip in <i>J.L.</i>). The government avers that the tip was neither truly anonymous (and so somewhat comparable to the tip in <i>Adams</i>) and that the tip was corroborated (like the tip in <i>White</i>). Our analysis takes two parts. We explain i) that the tip in this case, whether or not it can rightly bear the technical moniker \"anonymous,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> was akin to the anonymous tips analyzed by the Supreme Court in <i>J.L.</i> and <i>White</i> in that it could not provide reasonable suspicion unless corroborated; and ii) that because, as in <i>J.L.</i> and unlike in <i>White,</i> it was not sufficiently corroborated, the tip could not, by itself, provide reasonable suspicion for the vehicle stop.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">i. The Tip Itself</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government contends that the hearsay tip in this case was more reliable than the anonymous tip analyzed in <i>J.L.</i> because of the police officers' interactions with Cabral, and because Cabral was able to report a crime supposedly witnessed by his unnamed relative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certain of the government's arguments have superficial appeal. More so than in <i>J.L.,</i> the police here had some limited means of narrowing the class of people who might have provided the tip. <i>See J.L.</i> at 270, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118352\"><a href=\"/opinion/118352/florida-v-jl/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1375</span></a></span> (noting danger when informant cannot \"be held responsible\" for false information). And Cabral's description of his relative's report provided some small measure of context for the information that may not have been present if, as in <i>J.L.,</i> the police had received a bare tip, out of the blue, alleging the same facts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to the government's suggestion, however, the tip in this case bears some important badges of unreliability not present in the cases relied upon by the government. First, there is the hearsay problem. While the police or a 911 operator often can make some rough judgments about the age, cognitive ability, and motivations of an anonymous informant based on her tone of voice (if the tip occurs via the telephone), or appearance and demeanor (if the tip is delivered in person even by a complete stranger), the police here had no way of knowing the state of mind of Cabral's relative when she gave her information, or whether she was a person who could be relied on to relate events accurately. In cases where uncorroborated hearsay tips have been deemed reliable in contributing to reasonable suspicion, there has been a stronger indication that the informant can be trusted. In <i>Tucker,</i> 305 F.3d at 1196, and in <i>Fernandez-Castillo,</i> 324 F.3d at 1116, for instance, the police knew that the unnamed hearsay informant was a government employee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, there was a higher risk of fabrication here. The <i>J.L.</i> Court deemed anonymous tips inherently unreliable largely because such tips carry with them a risk of fabrication by the informant. <i>See J.L.,</i> 529 U.S. at 271, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118352\"><a href=\"/opinion/118352/florida-v-jl/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1375</span></a></span>. The hearsay tip in this case provided two distinct opportunities for fabrication. The tip was suspect 1) because Cabral may have had a motive to get a rival gang member into trouble with the law and could have fabricated both the Shirley Street shooting and the supposed communication from his relative, and 2) because even if Cabral was honest in his interactions with the police, his unnamed relative may have had her own motive for fabricating incriminating evidence about a rival gang member whom she may have suspected of harboring ill will towards a member of her family.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> There is no indication in any of the cases cited by the government that either a hearsay informant or a party relaying a hearsay tip to the police had so obvious a motive to lie as existed in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, crucially, and unlike in <i>J.L.,</i> the police had specific reasons to doubt the tip by the time they made their stop. In <i>J.L.,</i> \"there [were] no factors that cast doubt on the reliability of the tip.\" 529 U.S. at 271, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118352\"><a href=\"/opinion/118352/florida-v-jl/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1375</span></a></span>. In this case, there was no physical evidence of gunfire on Shirley Street (as there usually was after shootings in the neighborhood). No one had called the police to complain (usually neighborhood residents called 911 upon hearing gunfire). While officers in the city were alerted to be on the lookout, none saw Rodrigues or his car in the hours after the purported shooting or remembered seeing the car in the area of the purported shooting earlier that day. The government does not suggest, moreover, that in the week after the hearsay tip, the tipster or Cabral came forward with additional information; that any other witnesses to a Shirley Street shooting were found; or that physical evidence of a shooting or unexplained gunshot wounds in local hospitals emerged. When an initial police investigation into a tip of illegal activity reveals factors inconsistent with the tip, the reasonable suspicion analysis must take these indicia of unreliability into account along with any indicia of reliability. <i>See Adams,</i> 407 U.S. at 147, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108571\"><a href=\"/opinion/108571/adams-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Corroboration</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that the license plate number mentioned in the tip led to Rodrigues provides a solid means of identification, but it does not corroborate the tip's assertion that there had been a shooting on Shirley Street. When police officers stop a person in reliance on a tip, \"reasonable suspicion . . . requires that a tip be reliable in its assertion of illegality, not just in its tendency to identify a determinate person.\" <i>J.L.,</i> 529 U.S. at 272, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118352\"><a href=\"/opinion/118352/florida-v-jl/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

While \"knowledge of a person's prior criminal involvement (to say nothing of a mere arrest) is alone insufficient to give rise to the requisite reasonable suspicion,\" <i>United States v. Sandoval,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"673938\"><a href=\"/opinion/673938/united-states-v-miguel-sandoval/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">537</span></a></span>, 542 (10th Cir.1994) (collecting cases); <i>see also United States v.

Criminal history certainly can be considered in a reasonable suspicion analysis. <i>See United States v. Daoust,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"550086\"><a href=\"/opinion/550086/united-states-v-rodney-j-daoust/\"><span class=\"volume\">916</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">757</span></a></span>, 759 (1st Cir.1990) (Breyer, C.J.). And cases in other circuits have recognized that a history of crime and gang involvement can corroborate other evidence to establish reasonable suspicion that criminal conduct has occurred or is occurring. <i>See United States v. Feliciano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"687308\"><a href=\"/opinion/687308/united-states-v-juan-m-feliciano/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1070</span></a></span>, 1074 (7th Cir.1995) (Posner, J.) (holding that police officer's knowledge that search subject was \"a gang member recently released from prison,\" combined with observations and citizen complaint suggesting that subject had just attempted to mug a passerby and might do so again, contributed to reasonable suspicion). As the <i>Feliciano</i> court recognized, an individual's affiliation with a violent gang and prior criminal conduct may be probative of the likelihood that he has or is about to complete another, similar crime. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But, here, the officers' awareness of Rodrigues's involvement in gang activity and his prior arrest is not linked to any reliable information about criminal activity on Shirley Street. In the cases the government relies upon, courts have found that an individual's criminal history corroborated reliable information, such as a police officer's own observations, in constituting reasonable suspicion. In <i>United States v. Christmas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769843\"><a href=\"/opinion/769843/united-states-v-joseph-christmas-aka-jason-carter/\"><span class=\"volume\">222</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">141</span></a></span>, 143-45 (4th Cir.2000), the police conducted a <i>Terry</i> stop of a man they knew to be a convicted criminal, after receiving a face-to-face complaint by the man's neighbor, who risked retaliation for asking the police to intervene, and viewing objective indications of ongoing criminality. In <i>Feliciano,</i> it was the police officers' own observations of suspicious activity that led them to follow and identify the individual they stopped. 45 F.3d at 1074. In these cases, the police officers observed conduct indicating that an individual was engaged in criminal behavior, and their knowledge of the individual's criminal history helped to dispel any likelihood that the observed conduct actually was innocent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Here, the danger was that no criminal activity had occurred on Shirley Street at all.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Given the objective indications that there had been no Shirley Street shooting, Rodrigues's arrest and reputation are, at best, only a minimal indication that the criminal activity complained of in the hearsay tip had occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where \"a tip has a relatively low degree of reliability, more information will be required to establish the requisite quantum of suspicion than would be required if the tip were more reliable.\" <i>White,</i> 496 U.S. at 330, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112454\"><a href=\"/opinion/112454/alabama-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The <i>Hensley</i> Court explained that the \"factors in the balance\" of determining whether a <i>Terry</i> stop is permissible, \"may be somewhat different when a stop to investigate past criminal activity is involved rather than a stop to investigate ongoing criminal conduct.\" <i>Hensley,</i> 469 U.S. at 229, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111294\"><a href=\"/opinion/111294/united-states-v-hensley/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Questionable <i>Terry</i> stops may become even less reasonable if \"the police have had the time to develop\" better grounds for the stop but have failed to do so. <i>United States v. Hudson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789995\"><a href=\"/opinion/789995/united-states-v-scotty-lee-hudson/\"><span class=\"volume\">405</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">425</span></a></span>, 437 (6th Cir.2005) (explaining that <i>Hensley</i> incorporates an expectation that police will make efforts to investigate crimes, and that \"courts will hold the police to this expectation in appropriate cases\"). By March 31st, the tip could provide only a marginal benefit to the government in a reasonable suspicion analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, while there may be a rationale for according special weight to anonymous tips in cases of an imminent threat to public safety, there was no imminent threat in this case. <i>See J.L.,</i> 529 U.S. at 273-74, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118352\"><a href=\"/opinion/118352/florida-v-jl/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1375</span></a></span> (recognizing that in some cases, such as \"a report of a person carrying a bomb,\" \"the danger alleged in an anonymous tip may be so great as to justify a search without a showing of reliability\"). True, if the vehicle stop had occurred immediately after the tip on March 25th, and before any opportunity for investigation, the government might have argued that an imminent threat existed &#8212; facing two reported shootings, the police may have had legitimate reasons to fear that another shooting might soon occur. But the police did not report any reason to suspect that Rodrigues and his car posed a danger on March 31st, and the government does not argue that there was any such reason. The lack of any indication of an immediate threat to the public also differentiates this case from many in which a stop has been based on a corroborated anonymous tip of ongoing criminal activity, <i>see, e.g., United States v. Wheat,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776340\"><a href=\"/opinion/776340/united-states-v-wade-allen-wheat/\"><span class=\"volume\">278</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">722</span></a></span> (8th Cir.2001) (reckless driving); <i>State v.

In these cases, there were strong exigent rationales for quick police action (e.g., imminent danger to the public and loss of evidence) that are altogether absent here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, contrary to the government's assertion, we are not persuaded that there were any other substantial \"governmental interests,\" <i>Hensley,</i> 469 U.S. at 229, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111294\"><a href=\"/opinion/111294/united-states-v-hensley/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">675</span></a></span>, involved in the March 31st vehicle stop. In a <i>Terry</i> stop to investigate a completed crime, there normally is either a reasonable suspicion that the person stopped is the known individual wanted for a crime that is known to have occurred, <i>see, e.g., Hensley,</i> 469 U.S. at 224, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111294\"><a href=\"/opinion/111294/united-states-v-hensley/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">675</span></a></span> (police department had issued \"wanted flyer\" for driver) or a reasonable suspicion that the stop will uncover evidence of a recently-committed crime, <i>see, e.g., United States v. Tilmon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"666028\"><a href=\"/opinion/666028/united-states-v-spencer-ray-tilmon/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1221</span></a></span>, 1225 (7th Cir.1994) (\"exact match\" of subject and his car to those described as involved in bank robbery two hours earlier). Some of these rationales might plausibly have been articulated if Coyne and Griffiths had seen and stopped Rodrigues on March 25th, before there was time for any investigation and shortly after the purported Shirley Street shooting was supposed to have taken place. (At that point, for instance, the officers might have expected to detect fleeting physical evidence of a recent shooting, such as a hot gun, gunpowder residue, or the odor of gunpowder on Rodrigues's person.) But none of these rationales applies to the March 31st stop.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This also might have been a different case if the police had demonstrated that they had no better way to question Rodrigues a week after the purported crime on Shirley Street. We can envision circumstances where a <i>Terry</i> stop to investigate a completed crime may be justified in part because the police have searched for a suspect in all his usual haunts but failed to find him. In those circumstances, a suspect's unusual absence may be probative of an effort to elude the police and an articulable indication of specific past criminal activity. But there is no evidence that this was such a case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, the police had little more reason to suspect Rodrigues of specific criminal activity on March 31st than they did before receiving the hearsay tip. The police suspected Rodrigues of being affiliated with a gang and knew of his recent arrest. And the police knew that there had been gang violence in the neighborhood. But the government does not suggest that the police had information tying Rodrigues, personally, to any of this violence. The only possible crime to which the police could tie Rodrigues &#8212; the Shirley Street shooting &#8212; was one that appeared, in all likelihood, never to have occurred. After considering all of the circumstances relevant to the March 31st stop, we conclude that the district court correctly suppressed the evidence derived therefrom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Specifically, Coyne testified that after shootings in the neighborhood:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">There would be parties outside.
