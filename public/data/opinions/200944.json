Petitioner-appellant Sam\n\nNeang Keo Chan applied for political asylum pursuant to 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1158(b)(1) and withholding of removal pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §§\n\n1101 et seq. and 1229a.      The Immigration Judge (IJ) denied Chan’s\n\napplication, and the Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed that\n\ndecision without opinion.         We affirm the Board’s decision on the\n\nground that it is supported by substantial evidence.\n\n                             I.         BACKGROUND\n\n            Chan, a forty-six year old native of Cambodia, last\n\nentered the United States on October 8, 1998, on a non-immigrant\n\nvisa.    Despite her visa's expiring on November 6, 1998, Chan\n\nremained in the United States and on January 19, 1999, applied for\n\npolitical asylum and withholding of removal.\n\n            This case takes place against the turbulent political\n\nbackdrop of Cambodian history.           After decades of turmoil, in 1993\n\nthe   Cambodian   government      was    established    as    a   constitutional\n\nmonarchy.    King Sihanouk was named Head of State, and Prince\n\nRanariddh and Hun Sen served as First and Second Prime Ministers,\n\nrespectively.     In July, 1997, Hun Sen overthrew Prince Ranariddh,\n\nand a period of violence ensued.              Subsequently, Hun Sen agreed to\n\ndemocratic elections, which he won in July, 1998.                  According to\n\nState Department reports, the 1998 electoral campaign and its\n\naftermath   \"were   marred     by   protests,       voter    intimidation,   and\n\n\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fpartisan violence, some of it government-directed.\"                     Political\n\nstability has since been achieved through a coalition government.\n\n            Chan’s application for asylum, affidavit, and hearing\n\ntestimony set forth the following allegations:                  She was born on\n\nDecember 29, 1958, in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, and married Seng Hong\n\non July 7, 1978.     The couple had three children, now approximately\n\ntwenty, seventeen, and eight years of age.                  Under the Pol Pot\n\nregime, Chan’s family was forced to move from their home in Phnom\n\nPenh   to   the   province     area.     Her    father   was    taken    away   and\n\npresumably killed, her brother was executed, and Chan was enslaved\n\nin “the hard labor force.”\n\n            In early 1998, Chan became a member of the Sam Rainsy\n\nparty, a rival of Hun Sen.          On April 20, 1998, Chan received her\n\nmembership card and attended a meeting with her uncle, Lon Phon, a\n\nprominent leader in the Sam Rainsy party.             While she stood by the\n\ndoor greeting some of the 200 supporters in attendance, four Hun\n\nSen soldiers arrived on motorcycles.            They fired their weapons in\n\nthe air, pointed a gun at Chan’s head, and threatened to kill her\n\nif the meeting continued. Fearing harm, the Sam Rainsy supporters,\n\nincluding Chan and Lon Phon, fled.\n\n            On    July   11,    1998,   Chan   and   four   other   Sam    Rainsy\n\nsupporters, while distributing campaign materials in a Phnom Penh\n\nmarketplace, were approached by three Hun Sen soldiers.                         One\n\nsoldier,    identified     by    Chan    as    the   security    chief    of    the\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fmarketplace, put a gun to Chan’s head.1      He pulled the papers from\n\nher hands and warned her that she would “have a short life” if she\n\ncontinued to support the Sam Rainsy party.\n\n           After Hun Sen won the parliamentary elections on July 26,\n\n1998, the leaders of the opposing parties, Prince Ranariddh and Sam\n\nRainsy, accused Hun Sen of fraud.       Chan attended rallies where Sam\n\nRainsy supporters declared Hun Sen a stealer, a dictator, and a\n\nVietnamese    puppet.   The   political    protests    were   particularly\n\nviolent between September 7 and September 13, 1998.           Chan alleged\n\nthat on September 14, 1998, thirty thousand Sam Rainsy supporters,\n\nincluding Chan, convened outside the United States Embassy, waving\n\nUnited States, Cambodian, and Buddhist flags.         Eight thousand riot\n\npolice were deployed.    Chan asserted that police used guns, clubs,\n\nchains and water cannons to disperse the crowd.          Protesters were\n\narrested, beaten, and killed, but Chan was able to escape unharmed.\n\nShe subsequently walked sixty kilometers to safety in the village\n\nof Kampong Chamlong.\n\n             The following day, Hun Sen soldiers arrived at Chan’s\n\nhome, apparently looking for her.       Chan’s mother refused to inform\n\nthe soldiers of the location of either Chan or Chan’s husband, Seng\n\nHong.    One week later, the soldiers returned and ransacked Chan’s\n\nhome.    Chan’s mother was forced to the ground at gunpoint and\n\n\n\n     1\n      The IJ stated, apparently in error, that the gun was placed\nto Chan's stomach.\n\n                                  -4-\n\fasked, “Do you want to eat bullets or do you want to tell us where\n\nyour children are?” Seng Hong has been missing since the September\n\n14 demonstration, as have two of Chan’s friends.    Chan's uncle and\n\nhis family fled the country.\n\n            Chan contends that because she is a well-known Sam Rainsy\n\nsupporter, she fears she will be persecuted if she returns to\n\nCambodia.    She is also concerned for her three children; they\n\nremain in Cambodia with Chan's mother but do not attend school\n\nbecause Chan fears for their safety.\n\n            According to documents in the record, Chan visited the\n\nUnited States from June 24 to October 21, 1997, during the height\n\nof the coup.    She had no affiliation with Sam Rainsy or any other\n\npolitical party until the following year.      After the April 1998\n\nincident involving the Hun Sen soldiers at the Sam Rainsy meeting,\n\nshe traveled to China, where she remained from May 16 until May 30,\n\n1998.    On June 11, 1998, Chan again traveled to the United States\n\nand returned to Cambodia on July 5, 1998.2\n\n            Following the demonstration at the U.S. Embassy, Chan\n\nleft Cambodia on October 7, 1998, and arrived in San Francisco the\n\nnext day.      On January 14, 1999, she filed an application for\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      On June 9, 1998, the American Consulate in Phnom Penh issued\nChan a non-immigrant visa that was valid for multiple entries until\nJune 19, 1999. Chan contends that the visa was issued on June 19,\n1997.\n\n                                 -5-\n\fpolitical asylum and withholding of removal.3        On May 2, 2000, an\n\nImmigration Judge heard her case.        On October 10, 2000, the IJ\n\nissued a decision denying Chan’s application.        She appealed to the\n\nBoard of Immigration Appeals, which affirmed the decision without\n\nopinion pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(4).              She now seeks\n\njudicial review of the decision of the Board.\n\n                           II. DISCUSSION\n\n          In her petition for review, Chan contends that the Board\n\nerred in affirming the IJ’s decision.         She claims that the IJ\n\nerroneously found her testimony not to be credible and that she\n\nadduced sufficient evidence to prove that she is both a victim of\n\npast persecution and a likely target of future persecution.\n\nA.        Applicable law\n\n          This court reviews the Board's findings of fact and\n\ncredibility under a \"substantial evidence\" standard.        Mediouni v.\n\nINS, 314 F.3d 24, 26 (1st Cir. 2002) (citing Yatskin v. INS, 255\n\nF.3d 5, 9 (1st Cir. 2001)).       \"Board determinations of statutory\n\neligibility for relief from deportation, whether via asylum or\n\nwithholding   of   deportation,   are   conclusive   if   'supported   by\n\nreasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record\n\nconsidered as a whole.'\"      Id. at 26-27 (quoting INS v. Elias-\n\nZacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 480 (1992)).       Unless the applicant puts\n\n\n\n     3\n      Later in the proceedings, Chan added a request for protection\npursuant to the United Nations Convention Against Torture.\n\n                                  -6-\n\fforth evidence “so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could\n\nfail to find the requisite fear of persecution,” we will uphold a\n\ndenial of asylum.   Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. at 483-84.   When the\n\nBoard affirms without opinion, as it did here, we review the\n\ndecision of the Immigration Judge.    Quevedo v. Ashcroft, 336 F.3d\n\n39, 43 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n          The standard for withholding deportation is stricter than\n\nthat for asylum, thus “a petitioner unable to satisfy the asylum\n\nstandard fails, a fortiori, to satisfy the former.”   Mediouni, 314\n\nF.3d at 27 (quoting Velasquez v. Ashcroft, 305 F.3d 62, 64 n.2 (1st\n\nCir. 2002)).   Accordingly, we address Chan's asylum claim first.\n\n          An asylum applicant bears the burden of proving either\n\npast persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution.\n\nId.; 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b).   In establishing a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution, the applicant must prove “both a genuine\n\nsubjective fear and an objectively reasonable fear of persecution”\n\non the grounds of race, religion, nationality, membership in a\n\nparticular social group, or political opinion.   Mediouni, 314 F.3d\n\nat 27.   An objectively reasonable fear “requires a showing ‘by\n\ncredible, direct, and specific evidence . . . facts that would\n\nsupport a reasonable fear that the petitioner faces persecution.’”\n\nCivil v. INS, 140 F.3d 52, 55 (1st Cir. 1998) (quoting Ravindran v.\n\nINS, 976 F.2d 754, 758 (1st Cir. 1992)).      Here, the merits of\n\nChan’s claims rest largely on the credibility of her accounts.\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fB.        Past persecution\n\n          A finding of credibility is paramount in asylum cases.\n\nSee Gailius v. INS, 147 F.3d 34, 45 (1st Cir. 1998).      The IJ found\n\nthat Chan’s account of past persecution lacked the “ring of truth”\n\nnecessary to credit her account of alleged persecution, pointing to\n\ndiscrepancies between newspaper accounts of the September 14, 1998\n\ndemonstration and Chan's account.        According to Chan’s testimony\n\nand asylum application, the demonstration involved thirty thousand\n\nprotesters and eight thousand riot police in front of the Embassy.\n\nNews sources in the record, however, assert that the demonstration\n\nbegan with two hundred protesters and grew to fifteen to twenty-\n\nfive hundred protesters.     Published articles also indicate that\n\neight thousand Hun Sen supporters, not police, were transported to\n\nthe city and that although fifty-three people have been missing\n\nsince the demonstration, there were no proven deaths.              The IJ\n\nconcluded that this evidence contradicted Chan’s testimony that she\n\n“saw people being killed and being beaten everywhere.”\n\n          Chan   contends   that   these   inconsistencies   are    minor\n\ndiscrepancies that do not affect her credibility. See Wang v. INS,\n\n352 F.3d 1250, 1253 (9th Cir. 2003) (\"minor inconsistencies and\n\nminor omissions relating to unimportant facts will not support an\n\nadverse credibility finding”) (quoting De Leon-Barrios v. INS, 116\n\nF.3d 391, 393 (9th Cir. 1997)). While the discrepancies concerning\n\nthe September demonstration are not overwhelming, they do concern\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\ffacts that are central to her claims.     See De Leon-Barrios, 116\n\nF.3d at 393 (discrepancies between applications are not minor\n\nbecause they serve as the basis for applicant’s alleged fear of\n\npersecution); see also Borjorques-Villanueva v. INS, 194 F.3d 14,\n\n16 (1st Cir. 1999).   Under our deferential standard of review, see\n\nKalitani v. Ashcroft, 340 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2003), we will not\n\ndisturb the IJ's determination that the discrepancies were material\n\nto her credibility.\n\n          Moreover, other elements of Chan's account undermine her\n\nclaim of past persecution.      According to Chan, she was first\n\nthreatened by Hun Sen soldiers on April 20, 1998, the day she\n\nreceived her membership card and attended a meeting of Sam Rainsy\n\nsupporters.   Yet she left Cambodia for a two-week visit to China\n\nless than one month later.   She also traveled to the United States\n\non June 11, 1998, and returned to Cambodia on July 5, 1998.4       In\n\ndoing so, she subjected herself to inspections that typically\n\naccompany international flights.      Had she been the target of\n\npersecution, it is likely that she would have encountered some\n\ndifficulty in her travels. Moreover, had she been as frightened by\n\nthe April 20 incident as she suggests, it also is likely that she\n\nwould have been reluctant to return to Cambodia on both occasions.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      Chan stated that these trips were       for   \"pleasure\"   when\nquestioned about them during the hearing.\n\n                                -9-\n\f          In addition, Chan continued to work at the Phnom Penh\n\nmarketplace    following   her   alleged     assault   by    the   chief    of\n\nmarketplace    security.    Such    conduct    is   not     consistent     with\n\nvictimization.     Moreover, Chan has suffered no physical harm, an\n\nimportant consideration in our analysis of past persecution.                See\n\nGuzman v. INS, 327 F.3d 11, 15-16 (1st Cir. 2003); Lim v. INS, 224\n\nF.3d 929, 936 (9th Cir. 2000).       We therefore hold that the IJ's\n\nconclusion that Chan failed to prove past persecution is supported\n\nby substantial evidence.\n\nC.        Well-founded fear of future persecution\n\n          Chan also seeks to establish eligibility for asylum by\n\nadducing specific evidence justifying a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution.   See Velasquez, 342 F.3d at 58; Aguilar-Solis v. INS,\n\n168 F.3d 565, 572 (1st Cir. 1999).        She must prove that her fear is\n\nboth genuine and objectively reasonable.         Aguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d\n\nat 572.\n\n          Chan claims that her life was threatened on two occasions\n\nprior to the September 14 demonstration, yet she continued to live\n\nand work unharmed in Phnom Penh for nearly five months following\n\nthe first threat.     Chan also remained in Cambodia for more than\n\nthree weeks after the September 14 demonstration.            She had a valid\n\npassport and United States visa, and it is likely that she would\n\nhave fled immediately had she actually believed her life was in\n\nimminent danger.\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\f            Moreover, as the IJ pointed out, Chan was one of many Sam\n\nRainsy supporters in Cambodia.      She held no position of power\n\nwithin the party, and indeed had not even joined until 1998.       See\n\nKhem v. Ashcroft, 342 F.3d 51, 54 (1st Cir. 2003) (upholding the\n\ndenial of asylum on the basis that petitioner, a Cambodian citizen,\n\nwas not subject to future persecution because she was a low-level\n\nparty member, never made public speeches, and never held a party\n\noffice).\n\n            We also defer to the IJ's findings concerning changed\n\nconditions in Cambodia.     “Changed country conditions often speak\n\nvolumes about the objective reasonableness of an alien’s fear that\n\npersecution lurks should he return to his homeland.”          Aguilar-\n\nSolis, 168 F.3d at 572.        The record indicates the return of\n\npolitical stability to Cambodia since shortly after the September\n\n14 demonstration. Moreover, Chan's children and mother continue to\n\nlive in Cambodia; although the children do not attend school\n\nbecause of Chan's fears, there is        no record evidence indicating\n\nthat they face objective danger.        “The fact that close relatives\n\ncontinue to live peacefully in the alien’s homeland undercuts [her]\n\nclaim that persecution awaits [her] return.”      Khem, 342 F.3d at 54\n\n(quoting Guzman, 327 F.3d at 16).       Thus, we are not compelled to\n\nfind that Chan genuinely and reasonably fears future persecution in\n\nCambodia.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fD.           Chan's due process claim\n\n             Lastly, Chan contends that she was denied due process as\n\na result of the translation services provided to her.                   She asserts\n\nthat the IJ was unable to adequately evaluate her demeanor -- and\n\naccordingly, her credibility -- because the translations were not\n\nimmediately provided after each word, but rather were given at the\n\nconclusion of Chan’s answers.\n\n             While     an   adverse      credibility    determination      may   be\n\nreversed in the case of an inaccurate translation, see Amadou v.\n\nINS, 226 F.3d 724, 726 (6th Cir. 2000) (applicant denied due\n\nprocess because translator was incompetent); Perez-Lastor v. INS,\n\n208   F.3d    773,     777-78   (9th     Cir.   2000)   (asylum   applicant      was\n\nprejudiced by incompetent translation), Chan makes no such claim\n\nhere.        Rather,    she     merely    argues    that   she    was    generally\n\ndisadvantaged by the manner in which her testimony was translated.\n\nThere is no indication that any such objections were made at the\n\nasylum hearing.        See Albathani v. INS, 318 F.3d 365, 375 (1st Cir.\n\n2003) (affirming the Board’s denial of asylum where applicant\n\nfailed to question the accuracy of translation at his hearing and\n\nasserted no specific errors in translation on appeal).                    Nor does\n\nChan specify any particular translated statement as problematic, or\n\nexplain how she was prejudiced thereby.\n\n             Moreover, while we have acknowledged that a “witness’s\n\ndemeanor is often a critical factor in determining his veracity,”\n\n\n                                         -12-\n\fAguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d at 570-71, it does not appear that the IJ\n\nrelied upon Chan's demeanor in determining that her testimony was\n\nnot credible.   Instead, he based his credibility finding on Chan’s\n\naccount of the September 14 demonstration. We conclude that Chan’s\n\ndue   process   rights   were   not   violated   on   the   basis   of   the\n\ntranslation.\n\n           For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals’ judgment as to Chan's petitions.5\n\n\n\n\n      5\n      As noted supra, our holding as to the asylum claim obviates\nfurther consideration of the withholding of deportation claim.

We affirm the Board’s decision on the\n\nground that it is supported by substantial evidence.\n\n                             I.         BACKGROUND\n\n            Chan, a forty-six year old native of Cambodia, last\n\nentered the United States on October 8, 1998, on a non-immigrant\n\nvisa.    Despite her visa's expiring on November 6, 1998, Chan\n\nremained in the United States and on January 19, 1999, applied for\n\npolitical asylum and withholding of removal.\n\n            This case takes place against the turbulent political\n\nbackdrop of Cambodian history.           After decades of turmoil, in 1993\n\nthe   Cambodian   government      was    established    as    a   constitutional\n\nmonarchy.    King Sihanouk was named Head of State, and Prince\n\nRanariddh and Hun Sen served as First and Second Prime Ministers,\n\nrespectively.     In July, 1997, Hun Sen overthrew Prince Ranariddh,\n\nand a period of violence ensued.              Subsequently, Hun Sen agreed to\n\ndemocratic elections, which he won in July, 1998.                  According to\n\nState Department reports, the 1998 electoral campaign and its\n\naftermath   \"were   marred     by   protests,       voter    intimidation,   and\n\n\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fpartisan violence, some of it government-directed.\"                     Political\n\nstability has since been achieved through a coalition government.\n\n            Chan’s application for asylum, affidavit, and hearing\n\ntestimony set forth the following allegations:                  She was born on\n\nDecember 29, 1958, in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, and married Seng Hong\n\non July 7, 1978.     The couple had three children, now approximately\n\ntwenty, seventeen, and eight years of age.                  Under the Pol Pot\n\nregime, Chan’s family was forced to move from their home in Phnom\n\nPenh   to   the   province     area.     Her    father   was    taken    away   and\n\npresumably killed, her brother was executed, and Chan was enslaved\n\nin “the hard labor force.”\n\n            In early 1998, Chan became a member of the Sam Rainsy\n\nparty, a rival of Hun Sen.          On April 20, 1998, Chan received her\n\nmembership card and attended a meeting with her uncle, Lon Phon, a\n\nprominent leader in the Sam Rainsy party.             While she stood by the\n\ndoor greeting some of the 200 supporters in attendance, four Hun\n\nSen soldiers arrived on motorcycles.            They fired their weapons in\n\nthe air, pointed a gun at Chan’s head, and threatened to kill her\n\nif the meeting continued. Fearing harm, the Sam Rainsy supporters,\n\nincluding Chan and Lon Phon, fled.\n\n            On    July   11,    1998,   Chan   and   four   other   Sam    Rainsy\n\nsupporters, while distributing campaign materials in a Phnom Penh\n\nmarketplace, were approached by three Hun Sen soldiers.                         One\n\nsoldier,    identified     by    Chan    as    the   security    chief    of    the\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fmarketplace, put a gun to Chan’s head.1      He pulled the papers from\n\nher hands and warned her that she would “have a short life” if she\n\ncontinued to support the Sam Rainsy party.\n\n           After Hun Sen won the parliamentary elections on July 26,\n\n1998, the leaders of the opposing parties, Prince Ranariddh and Sam\n\nRainsy, accused Hun Sen of fraud.       Chan attended rallies where Sam\n\nRainsy supporters declared Hun Sen a stealer, a dictator, and a\n\nVietnamese    puppet.   The   political    protests    were   particularly\n\nviolent between September 7 and September 13, 1998.           Chan alleged\n\nthat on September 14, 1998, thirty thousand Sam Rainsy supporters,\n\nincluding Chan, convened outside the United States Embassy, waving\n\nUnited States, Cambodian, and Buddhist flags.         Eight thousand riot\n\npolice were deployed.    Chan asserted that police used guns, clubs,\n\nchains and water cannons to disperse the crowd.          Protesters were\n\narrested, beaten, and killed, but Chan was able to escape unharmed.\n\nShe subsequently walked sixty kilometers to safety in the village\n\nof Kampong Chamlong.\n\n             The following day, Hun Sen soldiers arrived at Chan’s\n\nhome, apparently looking for her.       Chan’s mother refused to inform\n\nthe soldiers of the location of either Chan or Chan’s husband, Seng\n\nHong.    One week later, the soldiers returned and ransacked Chan’s\n\nhome.    Chan’s mother was forced to the ground at gunpoint and\n\n\n\n     1\n      The IJ stated, apparently in error, that the gun was placed\nto Chan's stomach.\n\n                                  -4-\n\fasked, “Do you want to eat bullets or do you want to tell us where\n\nyour children are?” Seng Hong has been missing since the September\n\n14 demonstration, as have two of Chan’s friends.    Chan's uncle and\n\nhis family fled the country.\n\n            Chan contends that because she is a well-known Sam Rainsy\n\nsupporter, she fears she will be persecuted if she returns to\n\nCambodia.    She is also concerned for her three children; they\n\nremain in Cambodia with Chan's mother but do not attend school\n\nbecause Chan fears for their safety.\n\n            According to documents in the record, Chan visited the\n\nUnited States from June 24 to October 21, 1997, during the height\n\nof the coup.    She had no affiliation with Sam Rainsy or any other\n\npolitical party until the following year.      After the April 1998\n\nincident involving the Hun Sen soldiers at the Sam Rainsy meeting,\n\nshe traveled to China, where she remained from May 16 until May 30,\n\n1998.    On June 11, 1998, Chan again traveled to the United States\n\nand returned to Cambodia on July 5, 1998.2\n\n            Following the demonstration at the U.S. Embassy, Chan\n\nleft Cambodia on October 7, 1998, and arrived in San Francisco the\n\nnext day.      On January 14, 1999, she filed an application for\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      On June 9, 1998, the American Consulate in Phnom Penh issued\nChan a non-immigrant visa that was valid for multiple entries until\nJune 19, 1999. Chan contends that the visa was issued on June 19,\n1997.\n\n                                 -5-\n\fpolitical asylum and withholding of removal.3        On May 2, 2000, an\n\nImmigration Judge heard her case.        On October 10, 2000, the IJ\n\nissued a decision denying Chan’s application.        She appealed to the\n\nBoard of Immigration Appeals, which affirmed the decision without\n\nopinion pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(4).              She now seeks\n\njudicial review of the decision of the Board.\n\n                           II. DISCUSSION\n\n          In her petition for review, Chan contends that the Board\n\nerred in affirming the IJ’s decision.         She claims that the IJ\n\nerroneously found her testimony not to be credible and that she\n\nadduced sufficient evidence to prove that she is both a victim of\n\npast persecution and a likely target of future persecution.\n\nA.        Applicable law\n\n          This court reviews the Board's findings of fact and\n\ncredibility under a \"substantial evidence\" standard.

The IJ found\n\nthat Chan’s account of past persecution lacked the “ring of truth”\n\nnecessary to credit her account of alleged persecution, pointing to\n\ndiscrepancies between newspaper accounts of the September 14, 1998\n\ndemonstration and Chan's account.        According to Chan’s testimony\n\nand asylum application, the demonstration involved thirty thousand\n\nprotesters and eight thousand riot police in front of the Embassy.\n\nNews sources in the record, however, assert that the demonstration\n\nbegan with two hundred protesters and grew to fifteen to twenty-\n\nfive hundred protesters.     Published articles also indicate that\n\neight thousand Hun Sen supporters, not police, were transported to\n\nthe city and that although fifty-three people have been missing\n\nsince the demonstration, there were no proven deaths.              The IJ\n\nconcluded that this evidence contradicted Chan’s testimony that she\n\n“saw people being killed and being beaten everywhere.”\n\n          Chan   contends   that   these   inconsistencies   are    minor\n\ndiscrepancies that do not affect her credibility.

According to Chan, she was first\n\nthreatened by Hun Sen soldiers on April 20, 1998, the day she\n\nreceived her membership card and attended a meeting of Sam Rainsy\n\nsupporters.   Yet she left Cambodia for a two-week visit to China\n\nless than one month later.   She also traveled to the United States\n\non June 11, 1998, and returned to Cambodia on July 5, 1998.4       In\n\ndoing so, she subjected herself to inspections that typically\n\naccompany international flights.      Had she been the target of\n\npersecution, it is likely that she would have encountered some\n\ndifficulty in her travels. Moreover, had she been as frightened by\n\nthe April 20 incident as she suggests, it also is likely that she\n\nwould have been reluctant to return to Cambodia on both occasions.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      Chan stated that these trips were       for   \"pleasure\"   when\nquestioned about them during the hearing.\n\n                                -9-\n\f          In addition, Chan continued to work at the Phnom Penh\n\nmarketplace    following   her   alleged     assault   by    the   chief    of\n\nmarketplace    security.    Such    conduct    is   not     consistent     with\n\nvictimization.     Moreover, Chan has suffered no physical harm, an\n\nimportant consideration in our analysis of past persecution.                See\n\nGuzman v.

Chan also remained in Cambodia for more than\n\nthree weeks after the September 14 demonstration.            She had a valid\n\npassport and United States visa, and it is likely that she would\n\nhave fled immediately had she actually believed her life was in\n\nimminent danger.\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\f            Moreover, as the IJ pointed out, Chan was one of many Sam\n\nRainsy supporters in Cambodia.

She asserts\n\nthat the IJ was unable to adequately evaluate her demeanor -- and\n\naccordingly, her credibility -- because the translations were not\n\nimmediately provided after each word, but rather were given at the\n\nconclusion of Chan’s answers.\n\n             While     an   adverse      credibility    determination      may   be\n\nreversed in the case of an inaccurate translation, see Amadou v.\n\nINS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770416\"><a href=\"/opinion/770416/mamadou-amadou-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">226</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">724</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 726 (6th Cir. 2000) (applicant denied due\n\nprocess because translator was incompetent); Perez-Lastor v.

Rather,    she     merely    argues    that   she    was    generally\n\ndisadvantaged by the manner in which her testimony was translated.\n\nThere is no indication that any such objections were made at the\n\nasylum hearing.        See Albathani v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200413\"><a href=\"/opinion/200413/albathani-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">365</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 375 (1st Cir.\n\n2003) (affirming the Board’s denial of asylum where applicant\n\nfailed to question the accuracy of translation at his hearing and\n\nasserted no specific errors in translation on appeal).                    Nor does\n\nChan specify any particular translated statement as problematic, or\n\nexplain how she was prejudiced thereby.\n\n             Moreover, while we have acknowledged that a “witness’s\n\ndemeanor is often a critical factor in determining his veracity,”\n\n\n                                         -12-\n\fAguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d at 570-71, it does not appear that the IJ\n\nrelied upon Chan's demeanor in determining that her testimony was\n\nnot credible.   Instead, he based his credibility finding on Chan’s\n\naccount of the September 14 demonstration. We conclude that Chan’s\n\ndue   process   rights   were   not   violated   on   the   basis   of   the\n\ntranslation.\n\n           For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals’ judgment as to Chan's petitions.5\n\n\n\n\n      5\n      As noted supra, our holding as to the asylum claim obviates\nfurther consideration of the withholding of deportation claim.
