This     consolidated   appeal\n\nconcerns a scheme to embezzle and launder funds for a union health\n\nplan.     The eleven defendants-appellants were employees of the\n\nPuerto   Rico    Aqueducts   and   Sewer   Authority    (the   Autoridad   de\n\nAcueductos y Alcantarillados de Puerto Rico, hereinafter the \"AAA\")\n\nand officials of the Unión Independiente Auténtica de Empleados de\n\nla AAA (hereinafter the \"Union\").          Each defendant was convicted\n\nafter a jury trial of embezzling and laundering funds designated\n\nfor a health plan administered by the Union.             The appeal raises\n\nnumerous issues concerning the sufficiency of the evidence, the\n\njury instructions, trial procedure, and sentencing.            After careful\n\nconsideration, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for\n\nfurther proceedings.\n\n\nI.    Background. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -7-\n\nA.

Background\n\n            The following facts are based on the evidence presented\n\nat trial.\n\nA.    Dramatis Personae\n\n            There      are     eleven     appellant-defendants        in     this\n\nconsolidated appeal (together, the \"Defendants\").              They are:\n\n(1)    Héctor René Lugo-Ríos (\"Lugo\")\n\n(2)    Andrés Carrasquillo-Colón (\"Carrasquillo\")\n\n(3)    Elba García-Pastrana (\"García\")\n\n(4)    Felipe Román-Lozada (\"Román\")\n\n(5)    Jesús Caraballo-Ortiz (\"Caraballo\")\n\n(6)    Luis Andino-Delbrey (\"Andino\")\n\n(7)    Francisco Martínez-Irizarry (\"Martínez\")\n\n(8)    Juan Ramos-Hernández (\"Ramos\")\n\n(9)    Enrique Vázquez-Préstamo (\"Vázquez\")\n\n(10) Jorge L. Urbina-Acevedo (\"Urbina\")\n\n(11) Juan Roldán-Vega (\"Roldán\")\n\nThe Defendants were non-management, \"regular\" employees of AAA, a\n\npublic utility company providing water and sewer services to Puerto\n\nRico's residents.      Each defendant was also a member of the Union,\n\nwhich   represented     AAA's   non-management      employees.     Management\n\nemployees   of   AAA    were    members   of   a   different   union,      called\n\nHermandad     Independiente      Empleados     Profesionales     de     la   AAA\n\n(\"HIEPPA\").\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\f           At all times relevant to this appeal, the Union had\n\napproximately 4,500 total members, and each member paid $7 per\n\nmonth in membership dues.      The Union had other funds.       Apart from\n\nthe health plan contributions at issue in this appeal, the Union\n\nalso received (1) monthly contributions to \"a temporary disability\n\ninsurance\"   program   known   as   the   \"SINOT    and   Uniform    Benefits\n\nprogram\" (hereinafter \"SINOT\");1 (2) monthly contributions to an\n\nemployee savings and retirement program; and (3) money received by\n\nthe Union for renting out a parking lot.\n\n           The Union's composition, activities, and finances were\n\ngoverned by two documents: (1) a constitution and (2) a collective\n\nbargaining agreement with the AAA.2           The Union's constitution\n\nestablished a Central Executive Committee (\"CEC\") responsible for\n\nthe Union's finances and day-to-day administration.                  The CEC\n\nconsisted of a president, vice president, executive secretary, and\n\ntreasurer, as well as a single representative from each of the\n\nUnion's seven local chapters.          At all times relevant to this\n\nappeal,   Lugo,   Carrasquillo,     García,   and   Román   served    as   the\n\npresident, vice president, executive secretary, and treasurer,\n\n\n\n1\n   At trial, José Nieves, AAA's Labor Relations manager labor,\ntestified that SINOT was a Spanish acronym for \"temporary\ndisability insurance, occupational insurance.\"\n2\n   The collective bargaining agreement relevant to this appeal was\nin effect from 1998 until 2003.     Afterwards, and as discussed\nbelow, the Union went on strike after negotiations broke down on a\nnew collective bargaining agreement.\n\n                                    -8-\n\frespectively, of the CEC (together, the \"Top Four Defendants\"). At\n\nall times relevant to this appeal, Caraballo, Andino, Martínez,\n\nRamos, Vázquez, Urbina, and Roldán were presidents of the Union's\n\nseven local chapters (together, the \"Chapter Presidents\").\n\n           The Union did not provide a salary for CEC officers.\n\nInstead, the officers were paid under a labor leave with pay\n\nprovision in the collective bargaining agreement.         Under that\n\n\"labor leave\" provision, also referred to as a \"labor license,\" the\n\nAAA paid the officers their full salaries, but excused the officers\n\nfrom their AAA jobs to work full time for the Union.3\n\n           Under the collective-bargaining agreement, the AAA agreed\n\nto contribute a fixed amount per month to a \"health insurance plan\"\n\nfor every Union member.4    At all times relevant to this appeal, the\n\nmonthly contributions ranged from $232 to $355 per member.\n\n\n\n3\n    The provision states:\n\n      The [AAA] shall grant the Union full leave with pay to\n      the members of the executive central committee of the\n      Union . . . . The Union shall reimburse said salaries\n      including fringe benefits.\n4\n    The provision states:\n\n      The [AAA] agrees to contribute to the health insurance\n      plan the following amounts for each Union member employee\n      so that the employee, his spouse and dependent children\n      under the age of 19 or, if they continue on as full-time\n      students, up to the age of 23, may enjoy the following\n      services: A) A family health insurance plan that includes\n      hospitalization, surgery, and dispensary services B) a\n      medicine payment plan, C) a dental plan, D) major\n      medical, and E) eyeglasses.\n\n                                  -9-\n\f              Until 1993, the Union used the AAA's contributions to\n\nadminister a health plan called Plan de Salud UIA (the \"Old Health\n\nPlan\").   The Old Health Plan was not incorporated as a \"health\n\nservice organization\" and thus was not subject to the jurisdiction\n\nof Puerto Rico's Office of the Insurance Commissioner (the \"OIC\").\n\n              In late 1993, the CEC incorporated the Union-operated\n\nplan as a health service organization, Plan de Salud UIA (the\n\n\"Health Plan\" or \"Plan\").     Defendants Lugo, Carrasquillo, García,\n\nand   Román    filed   paperwork   certifying   that   the   Union   would\n\nadminister the AAA's medical contributions \"in compliance with\" and\n\notherwise be subject to \"the Puerto Rico Insurance Code.\"              In\n\nincorporating the Health Plan, the Union complied with provisions\n\nof the collective bargaining agreement that required that \"[t]he\n\nUnion . . . contract the services of a medical plan that is\n\nauthorized by the [OIC]\" and that \"the medical plan fully compl[y]\n\nwith all the requirements imposed by the [OIC].\"5\n\n              The Health Plan's bylaws provided that the Health Plan\n\nwas a \"non-profit corporation with the fundamental purpose of\n\nproviding health care services to the employees of [the AAA] who\n\nare members of the [Union].\"         They further stated that \"[t]he\n\nprincipal source of financing of [the Health Plan] shall be the\n\ncontributions negotiated by means of the Collective Bargaining\n\n\n5\n  These provisions were in the collective bargaining agreement in\neffect at the time of the incorporation, and were carried over into\nthe collective bargaining agreement at issue in this appeal.\n\n                                   -10-\n\fAgreement,   to   be    made   by   the   [AAA].\"      Under   the   collective\n\nbargaining agreement, the AAA would disburse each monthly Health\n\nPlan contribution to the Union via a check in the Union's name.6\n\nAlthough the funds were not directly sent to the Health Plan, the\n\nAAA's monthly checks stated on their face that they were \"health\n\nplan contribution[s],\"7 and the collective bargaining agreement\n\nfurther provided that AAA \"agree[d] to contribute to the medical\n\nplan the following amounts for each employee.\"             (Emphasis added).\n\nIn   addition,    the    collective       bargaining    agreement     did   not\n\nspecifically provide that the funds belonged to the Union or that\n\nthe Union could keep any surplus should it contract with a medical\n\nplan for less than the AAA contribution amount.\n\n          The Health Plan's bylaws further established a board of\n\ndirectors consisting of eleven members, four of whom would serve on\n\nan Executive Committee composed of a president, vice president,\n\nexecutive secretary, and treasurer, with nearly identical duties to\n\ntheir Union counterparts.           Like the Union's constitution, the\n\n\n6\n   Specifically, the bylaws provided that \"[t]he [AAA] shall send\ndirectly to the [Union] on or before the fifth (5th) day of each\nmonth the amount corresponding to the number of Union employees\ncovered monthly by the plan as of the last day of the preceding\nmonth.\"   In addition, José Nieves, the AAA's Labor Relations\nmanager, testified that the collective bargaining agreement\n\"established that [the payments] would be paid to Héctor René Lugo\nand [the Union],\" but that the checks were \"identified for health\nplan.\"\n7\n    The checks stated, below the name of the Union as payee,\n\"Aportación Plan Médico,\" which was translated at trial as \"health\nplan contribution.\"\n\n                                      -11-\n\fPlan's bylaws did not provide the board members with a salary.                     As\n\nprovided by the Puerto Rico Insurance Code, the Plan's board of\n\ndirectors would be \"fiduciarily responsible\" for funds received on\n\nbehalf of the Plan's subscribers.8\n\n           In 1995, after the Health Plan was incorporated, the\n\neleven   defendants     and    four     other     individuals     met    at     Union\n\nheadquarters     to   elect    a    board   for    the   Health   Plan.         Lugo,\n\nCarrasquillo, García, and Román were chosen for the Executive\n\nCommittee; they would serve as president, vice president, executive\n\nsecretary, and treasurer, respectively. The other seven defendants\n\nwere chosen for the other seven slots; they would serve as Health\n\nPlan \"delegates\" for their respective Union chapters. Thus, at the\n\ntimes relevant to this case, all eleven defendants simultaneously\n\nserved as members of the Union's CEC and as members of the Health\n\nPlan's board.\n\nB.   1998 to 2001 Conduct\n\n           The    Top   Four       Defendants     controlled    two     Union    bank\n\naccounts of significance to this appeal: (1) the Infrastructure\n\nAccount and (2) the Union Account.                The Top Four Defendants, in\n\n\n\n8\n     At trial the statute was translated as \"fiduciarily\nresponsible,\" although the official translation of the statute\ntranslates the words as \"fiducially liable.\" See P.R. Laws Ann.\ntit. 26, § 1907 (\"Fiduciary liability[:] Any director, officer or\nmember of a health service[ ] organization who receives, collects,\ndisburses or invests funds related to the activities of said\norganization, shall be fiducially liable for the funds received\nfrom the subscribers.\").\n\n                                       -12-\n\ftheir capacity as the Plan's executive committee, also controlled\n\nthe Health Plan's bank account (the \"Plan Account\"), which belonged\n\ndirectly to the Health Plan.\n\n              From 1998 through most of 2001, the evidence showed that,\n\nupon receipt of the monthly \"medical plan contributions\" from the\n\nAAA,   Lugo    and   Román    would   generally     engage   in   the   following\n\ntransactions:\n\n              1.      Lugo and Román would first deposit all\n                      of the AAA's Health Plan contributions\n                      directly into the Plan Account.\n\n              2.      After the first transfer was complete,\n                      Lugo and Román would then transfer some\n                      of that money from the Plan Account\n                      into the Infrastructure Account.\n\n              3.      They would then transfer some of the\n                      money from the Infrastructure Account\n                      to the Union Account, which is where\n                      the   Union's membership   dues  were\n                      deposited.\n\n              4.      Finally, they would pay themselves and\n                      the other Defendants from both the\n                      Infrastructure and Union Accounts, via\n                      regular checks subsequently cashed or\n                      deposited into each of the Defendant's\n                      personal bank accounts.\n\n              In   2000,     the   OIC,     using   its   broad   investigatory\n\nauthority,9 audited the Health Plan.                During the audit of the\n\n\n\n9\n   See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 1903a(2) (\"The Commissioner may\nexamine and investigate [those organizations subject to its\njurisdiction] with the purpose of determining their organization\nand solvency, as well as their compliance with the provisions of\nthis Code.\"); id. § 1918 (setting forth required examinations of\norganizations subject to the OIC's oversight).\n\n                                          -13-\n\ftransfers from the Plan Account to the Infrastructure Account, the\n\nOIC discovered that the transfers amounted to six percent of the\n\nAAA's monthly contributions, and that the Union was charging the\n\nPlan that amount for \"administrative services.\"             Because there was\n\nno contract or other documentation to support the six-percent\n\npayments, the OIC concluded that the Health Plan had violated the\n\nInsurance Code, which required a health service organization to\n\nfile a formal request before delegating administrative functions to\n\nanother    entity.10     Moreover,     the   OIC     requested       additional\n\ninformation    concerning     the   breakdown   of    the    \"administrative\n\nservices\" charged to the Health Plan.        Lugo responded in an August\n\n2001 letter that the charge covered such things as \"computer\n\nsystems,\" \"equipment,\" \"building,\" and \"human resources\" needed to\n\nadminister    and   operate   the   Health   Plan.     The     OIC    kept   its\n\ninvestigation open.\n\n           During this time, the Health Plan had negative cash flow,\n\nsuch that, by the latter part of 2001, the Health Plan could not\n\ncover its expenses. Under the collective bargaining agreement, the\n\nAAA agreed to assist the Plan in resolving any \"deficit\" in its\n\nfinances, subject to an audit, so long as it was not caused by\n\n\"illegal     appropriation,     malfeasance,       misuse     of     funds    or\n\n\n\n10\n    See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 1905(2)(a) (\"A health services\norganization, before exercising . . . the power to contract\nadministrative functions . . . shall furnish to the Commissioner\nthe adequate information to justify the exercise of said powers.\").\n\n                                    -14-\n\fnegligence.\"11   Upon learning of the Health Plan debt, AAA reviewed\n\nrecords provided by the Health Plan to confirm the impairment, but\n\ndid not conduct a full third party audit.     The records submitted\n\nfor review did not reflect the payments made to the Defendants,\n\nbecause those payments were made from the Infrastructure and Union\n\nAccounts using money transferred out of the Plan Account.   Finding\n\nno problems in the Health Plan books provided by the Defendants, on\n\nSeptember 9, 2001, the AAA provided the Health Plan a check for\n\n$2,781,146 payable to the Union.       The Defendants deposited the\n\nmoney in the Union Account.       In the weeks that followed, the\n\nDefendants wrote four separate checks from the Union Account to the\n\nHealth Plan.     The checks totaled around $2.5M, less than the\n\napproximately $2.7M paid by the AAA to the Union to cover the\n\n\n\n\n11\n     The collective bargaining agreement provides:\n\n      The stipulation between [the Union] and the AAA dated\n      October 1, 1991 (requiring that in the event of an\n      operational deficit in the plan due to causes not\n      attributable to illegal appropriation, malfeasance,\n      misuse of funds or negligence of the plan manager), the\n      parties shall meet to analyze and resolve the deficits\n      (shall continue in effect with that review, except for\n      the change of the fiscal year to natural year as required\n      by [the Union]).\n\n                                -15-\n\fHealth Plan's impairment.12         The difference remained in the Union\n\nAccount.\n\n             Throughout the 1998 to 2001 period, the AAA's monthly\n\nmedical    contributions     were    $232    per   Union   member.     With   few\n\nexceptions, the Defendants deposited the full $232 into the Health\n\nPlan's     account   prior   to     reallocating     the   money     into   other\n\naccounts.13\n\n             Also during this time, the Defendants personally received\n\na substantial portion of the funds contained in the Infrastructure\n\nand Union Accounts as compared to the Union's total income.\n\n\n\n\n12\n     The checks were:\n\n      1.     September 14, 2001       -   $496,157.05\n      2.     September 26, 2001       -   $555,535.65\n      3.     October 2, 2001          -   $261,000.00\n      4.     October 3, 2001          - $1,142,199.25\n\nThe checks totaled $2,454,891.95.\n13\n   Late in 2001, however, the Defendants directly deposited more\nthan $3M of the contributions into the Union Account without first\ndepositing the funds into the Plan Account.\n\n   At the same time, the Defendants began making frequent transfers\nfrom the Union Account to the so-called Cultural Trips Account,\nwhich also belonged to the Union.     For the next several years,\nGarcía would receive regular payments from the Cultural Trips\nAccount. All told, she received $209,379 from the account during\nthe period when it contained diverted Health Plan funds. Like the\npayments she received from the Infrastructure and Union Accounts,\nshe did not report any of the Cultural Trips payments in her tax\nreturns.\n\n                                      -16-\n\f Year      Total         Total Payments       Combined      Total Income as\n           Payments      to Defendants        Total Paid    Reported on\n           to            from                 to            Union Balance\n           Defendants    Infrastructure       Defendants    Sheet (not\n           from Union    Account              from Both     including Health\n           Account                            Accounts      Plan\n                                                            contributions)14\n 1998      $319,742      $346,345             $666,087      $746,804\n 1999      $405,256      $352,285             $757,541      $690,357\n 2000 $348,910      $402,784         $751,694    $835,469\nIn total, from 1998 through 2001 the Defendants received $3 million\n\nfrom the Infrastructure and Union Accounts, with an average of\n\nabout $70,000 per Defendant per year. The amounts dwarf the amount\n\nreported by the Defendants on their annual income tax statement for\n\nthose    years,   ranging      from   $25,609    (Urbina,   1999)   to    $46,048\n\n(García, 2001).         Moreover, despite receiving these payments, the\n\nDefendants were not listed on the Health Plan's payroll or the\n\nPlan's tax returns.\n\n             Throughout this time period, García, in her role as\n\nexecutive secretary, certified to the OIC that all of the members\n\nof   the    Health    Plan's    board,   which    consisted   of    the    eleven\n\nDefendants, fully discussed the full gamut of the Plan's business\n\non a frequent basis.15\n\n\n14\n   As discussed in more detail below, the balance sheets did not\nreflect all funds available to the Union, such as the SINOT\ncontributions, but it did comprise the income the Union reported\nthat it received.\n15\n     The 1999 certification, for example, states:\n\n        I certify that the Board of Directors of the UIA's Health\n\n                                       -17-\n\fC.   2002 to 2003 Conduct\n\n               The landscape altered dramatically in the beginning of\n\n2002.\n\n               In early 2002, the OIC continued its investigation into\n\nthe \"administrative services\" the Defendants charged the Health\n\nPlan.    In January 2002, Lugo sent the OIC a letter attaching what\n\nhe claimed was the \"contract\" under which the Defendants provided\n\nsuch administrative services for the Health Plan. The contract had\n\nonly    been    signed   a   week   earlier    by   Lugo    and    José   Sánchez\n\nGastaltierri (\"Sánchez\"), the Health Plan's administrator. Sánchez\n\nwould later testify at trial that García had given him the contract\n\nto sign, and he had signed it that same day or the day afterward\n\nwithout analyzing it.        He further testified that he only signed it\n\nbecause he \"understood that to be a requirement\" of his job as a\n\n\"consultant\" to Lugo and the Health Plan.\n\n               Still in early 2002, a \"me-too\" clause in the collective\n\nbargaining agreement required AAA to contribute the same amount of\n\nfunds for health care for Union members as for members of HIEPPA.\n\nAccordingly,       beginning   in   February    2002,      the    AAA   began   to\n\ncontribute $355 monthly to the Health Plan for each Union member.\n\n\n       Plan, Inc., has not officially met during the last two\n       years. However, all of its members discuss and analyze\n       the diversity of administrative issues of their\n       incumbency on a daily basis. The reason for this being\n       that the premiums of the UIA Health Plan, Inc. are paid\n       entirely by the employer ([AAA]) and are subject to the\n       negotiation of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.\n\n                                      -18-\n\f          Also beginning in February 2002, the Defendants opened a\n\nnew banking account, known as the Welfare Account, which did not\n\nappear in either the Union's or the Health Plan's records.16           The\n\nopening of the Welfare Account came hot on the heels of a Report of\n\nExamination issued by the OIC on December 17, 2001, which found\n\nthat the Health Plan violated the Insurance Code17 by charging the\n\nAAA a higher rate than was approved by the OIC.18           In fact, the\n\nHealth Plan had not sought approval for its rate since 1994, when\n\nthe OIC approved a rate of $222 per subscriber.\n\n          Thus,   purportedly   to   avoid    any   fines   for   charging\n\nunapproved rates,19 the Defendants went against their prior practice\n\nand began to deposit the full $355 per member contribution into the\n\nWelfare Account, and later would transfer a substantial portion of\n\nthe contribution into the Health Plan.       The remaining amount would\n\n\n\n16\n    In fact, Rubén Luciano Guzmán (\"Luciano\"), the Health Plan's\naccountant, testified at trial that the Welfare Account effectively\nbelonged to the Union because he never had access to it.\n17\n   See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 1908(2)(a) (\"Every health services\norganization shall register the rates to be used in any health care\nplan with the Commissioner before applying them in Puerto Rico.\").\n18\n    After challenging the finding, the Defendants would later be\nfined for the violation in August 2003.\n19\n   Luciano would testify at trial that Carrasquillo told him that\nhe opened the Welfare Account because the OIC had fined them for\nsending the Plan a \"surplus\" above $222 and that he wanted \"to\navoid further fines.\" Luciano further testified that he did not\nbelieve Carrasquillo because, to avoid fines, the Defendants either\nwould have discontinued using unapproved rates or would have asked\nfor a rate increase.\n\n                                -19-\n\fbe transferred through different Union-controlled accounts to pay\n\nthe Defendants and to finance Union activities. In 2002, the AAA's\n\n$355 monthly contributions per member totaled more than $20.3\n\nmillion.   However, only $16.3 million of that amount ultimately\n\nreached the Health Plan.\n\n           The Health Plan subsequently faced another impairment.\n\nThis time, the Defendants decided that, to cover the debt, the\n\nHealth Plan would seek a series of loans from the Union, which\n\nwould require the Plan to obtain OIC approval of the loans.     The\n\nPlan sent the OIC the requisite paperwork, which was certified by\n\nGarcía and Román.   Luciano testified that, at the time the loans\n\nwere made, he \"did not believe that the [U]nion had that kind of\n\nmoney to lend . . . out,\" given how minimal its income was in\n\ncomparison with the Plan's.    He further testified that when he\n\naired his concerns, he was later fired, he believed in part because\n\nof these \"differences.\"    The OIC ultimately approved the loans\n\nbased on the Defendants' representations.\n\n           The Union made four loans to the Health Plan in 2002 and\n\n2003, totaling about $3.9 million.    The Defendants disbursed each\n\nof the four loan checks from the Union Account into the Plan\n\nAccount.    However, shortly after writing each loan check the\n\nDefendants would write another check in the same amount from the\n\nWelfare Account to the Union Account, sometimes on the same day (as\n\nshown below):\n\n\n                               -20-\n\f4/16/02     Union Account   º Health Plan   $600,057\n4/30/02     Welfare Account º Union Account $600,057\n\n4/9/03      Union Account   º Health Plan   $1,790,000\n4/9/03      Welfare Account º Union Account $1,790,000\n\n8/21/03     Union Account   º Health Plan   $183,245\n8/21/03     Welfare Account º Union Account $183,245\n\n9/11/03     Union Account   º Health Plan   $1,391,630\n9/11/03     Welfare Account º Union Account $1,391,630\n\nBecause the Welfare Account was funded with money intended for the\n\nHealth Plan, essentially the Union was loaning the Health Plan its\n\nown funds.    The OIC would later discover that the Health Plan was\n\nloaning itself its own money and order the loans annulled.\n\n            In 2003, the Defendants opened yet another Union bank\n\naccount, the Administration Account.      They deposited into that\n\naccount the remaining funds from the Old Health Plan, funds that\n\nhad never been transferred to the new Plan when it was first\n\nincorporated.    As with the Infrastructure and Union Accounts, the\n\nDefendants    also   diverted   funds   to   themselves   from   the\n\nAdministration Account.\n\n            Throughout the course of 2002 and 2003, the Defendants,\n\nparticularly Lugo, Carasquillo, and García, remained in contact\n\nwith the OIC concerning the purported administrative services\n\ncontract.    Aurea López, the OIC's chief investigator, testified at\n\nlength concerning irregularities in the contract, including but not\n\nlimited to: (1) the Health Plan, rather than seek approval from the\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\fOIC before delegating functions to the Union, submitted an already-\n\nexecuted contract; (2) the contract lacked any specificity; (3) the\n\nDefendants' responses to OIC questions concerning what the contract\n\ncovered were vague; (3) Lugo's attempt to clarify the contract in\n\none   instance   actually   added   terms   (such   as   property   damage\n\ninsurance) that were not in the contract; (4) the Union was\n\novercharging the Plan, paying more than $2.2 million more than fair\n\nmarket value for the services the Union provided; (5) neither the\n\nUnion nor the Plan passed a corporate resolution authorizing the\n\ncontract; and (6) the contract stated that Sánchez had \"complete\n\nauthority\" to sign it on the Plan's behalf, when there was no\n\nevidence that he had such authority.\n\n           From 2002 through 2003, the Defendants paid themselves a\n\ntotal of more than $1,700,000 from the Infrastructure, Union, and\n\nAdministration Accounts.     Again, none of the Defendants reported\n\nthis income in their tax returns, despite the fact that the income\n\noverwhelmed the amount of money they actually reported.        Moreover,\n\nthe Health Plan's tax returns, which again Lugo signed, did not\n\nlist the Defendants on the payroll.         Finally, from 2002 through\n\n2003, the Defendants were purportedly meeting regularly \"every\n\nday,\" eating lunch together in the Union's cafeteria (and charging\n\nthe meals to the Infrastructure Account to boot).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -22-\n\fD.    2004 to 2006 Conduct\n\n             In January 2004, the OIC formally rejected the purported\n\nadministrative services contract that had been submitted by the\n\nUnion, concluding that it \"substantially affect[ed] the financial\n\nsituation\"    of    the   Health   Plan.     The    OIC   cited   contractual\n\nirregularities and lack of control it allowed the Health Plan over\n\nits own finances as reasons for disallowing the arrangement.              The\n\nOIC   also    requested    information     from    Carrasquillo   about   the\n\nInfrastructure and Union Accounts, such as who was paid from them,\n\nhow much, and for what services.             Carrasquillo was less than\n\nforthcoming.       He responded that the Defendants were paid from the\n\nInfrastructure Account for spending \"50 to 60 percent of the[ir]\n\ntime\" on Health Plan matters, and that he could provide further\n\ndetails but the books were behind.            As for the Union Account,\n\nCarrasquillo stated that any inquiry into it was \"not appropriate\"\n\nand \"unrelated\" to the Health Plan. Despite the OIC's rejection of\n\nthe contract, the Defendants continued to transfer the Plan's funds\n\nas though the contract was still in effect.20\n\n             In May 2004, the OIC made public much of what it had\n\nlearned about the Health Plan during its investigation.                   The\n\nDefendants were subsequently ordered to transfer the $7.4M that\n\n\n20\n   In April 2004, Román retired as Union treasurer and was replaced\nby Víctor Cornier (\"Cornier\"). Román proceeded to receive $30,000\nfrom the Infrastructure, Union, and Administrative Accounts as an\n\"[e]xtraordinary bonus for [his] years of service,\" although the\nmaximum bonus authorized by the constitution was $1,000.\n\n                                    -23-\n\fremained in the Welfare Account to the Health Plan. After learning\n\nof the OIC's findings, the AAA stopped making monthly contributions\n\nto the Union for Health Plan purposes, and instead began to deposit\n\ncontribution payments directly into the Plan Account.               In August\n\n2004, the AAA stopped contributing to the Health Plan entirely. It\n\nalso ceased paying the Defendants under the labor leave provisions\n\nof the collective bargaining agreement.\n\n           Shortly    thereafter,    in    September      2004,   all   eleven\n\nDefendants filed amended tax returns for every year from 1998\n\nthrough 2003, reporting purported \"income\" that they had not\n\nreported earlier.    In a creative stroke, the Defendants listed the\n\npreviously unreported income as \"payments received for professions\n\nand   commissions\"   without   listing     what   those    \"professions\"   or\n\n\"commissions\" were.\n\n           In October 2004, the Union began a twelve week strike.\n\nWhile on strike, the Union members, including the Defendants, were\n\nnot entitled to any salary or benefits from the AAA.              Instead, the\n\nUnion itself would pay each member $300 every two weeks for\n\nparticipating in strike activities, for a maximum of up to $1,800.\n\nDuring the strike, however, all of the Defendants received payments\n\nfrom the Infrastructure and Union Accounts. Many of these payments\n\nwere treated as reimbursement expenses although the Defendants had\n\nno supporting documentation.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -24-\n\f          Including these final payments during the strike, the\n\nDefendants     received    a   total     of   more   than   $5.8M   from     the\n\nInfrastructure,    Union,      and    Administration   Accounts     from    1998\n\nthrough 2004.    The individual Defendants' totals were as follows:\n\nLugo                       $1,757,164\nCarrasquillo               $948,166\nGarcía                     $540,12721\nRomán                      $868,421\nCaraballo                  $287,204\nAndino                     $282,086\nMartínez                   $247,897\nRamos                      $234,714\nVázquez                    $247,075\nUrbina                     $194,729\nRoldán                     $203,827\n\n          In late October 2004, federal agents executed a search\n\nwarrant at the Union's headquarters, which also housed the Health\n\nPlan's offices. Agents seized from Lugo's office nearly $40,000 in\n\ncash, along with ten uncashed checks from the Infrastructure\n\nAccount and incomplete Health Plan board meeting minutes.\n\n          In 2005, a grand jury issued a subpoena to the Health\n\nPlan's custodian of records, seeking the complete minute book for\n\nthe Plan's board meetings.           García, the Health Plan's custodian,\n\ndeclined to produce the book, claiming that it was seized during\n\nthe search.    In early 2006, just months before trial, García gave\n\nthe minute book to her successor as the Health Plan's executive\n\nsecretary,    Enrique     Dávila     Vargas   (\"Dávila\"),   which   later    was\n\n\n\n21\n    This excluded the amounts that García had received from the\nCultural Trips Account.\n\n                                       -25-\n\fobtained by the government during trial.            The book contained\n\nadditional meeting minutes that were not included in the documents\n\nseized by the government.\n\nE.   The Proceedings\n\n           The Defendants were charged in a 140-count indictment.22\n\nCount 1 charged all Defendants with a conspiracy to violate 18\n\nU.S.C. § 669, which prohibits the embezzlement or misapplication of\n\nfunds of a \"health care benefit program.\"          Counts 2 through 132\n\neach charged an individual Defendant with receipt of a check from\n\na Union bank account (e.g., the Infrastructure Account, the Union\n\nAccount)   that   the   government    alleged   constituted   substantive\n\nembezzlement of Health Plan funds in violation of § 669.23         Counts\n\n133-39 charged Román and Lugo jointly with misapplication of funds\n\n\n22\n   The indictment also contained two forfeiture counts, Counts 141-\n42, that were later dismissed by the district court and are not at\nissue on appeal.\n23\n    For example, Counts 2-13 charged Lugo with embezzlement of\n\"assets of the [Health Plan], a health care benefit program, as\ndefined in Title 18, United States Code, Section 24,\" and listed\ntwelve checks, including dates, check numbers, amounts, and the\naccount   the  check  came   from  (Infrastructure,   Union,  or\nAdministration). The Counts were allocated as follows:\n\nCarrasquillo      Counts   14-25\nGarcía            Counts   26-36\nRomán             Counts   37-48\nCaraballo         Counts   49-60\nAndino            Counts   61-72\nMartínez          Counts   73-84\nRamos             Counts   85-96\nVázquez           Counts   97-108\nUrbina            Counts   109-120\nRoldán            Counts   121-132\n\n                                     -26-\n\fin violation 18 U.S.C. § 669, specifically funds concerning the Old\n\nHealth Plan.24       Finally, Count 140 charged all of the Defendants\n\nwith a conspiracy to commit money laundering in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(A)(i), § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i), & § 1956(h).\n\n          The case proceeded to trial, which commenced on May 2,\n\n2006.    At    trial,       a    number    of    witnesses    testified      for   the\n\ngovernment:    Nieves;      López;       Luciano;      Sánchez;   Cornier;    Dávila;\n\nJennifer Griffen, an FBI financial analyst who was involved in the\n\nOctober 2004 search and who testified to the payments to the\n\nDefendants    from    the       Union,    Infrastructure,     and   Administrative\n\nAccounts; Clotilde Díaz (\"Díaz\"), who ran the Union cafeteria; and\n\nGerald LaPorte, an expert on ink analysis of documents.                            The\n\nDefendants countered with, among other things, the testimony of\n\nLemuel Toledo (\"Toledo\"), a certified insurance counselor who\n\ntestified as to the reasonableness of the rate charged under the\n\nadministrative       services      contract      and    Manuel    Villalón,    a   tax\n\nattorney and CPA who advised the Defendants.\n\n          Of significance to this appeal, the government gave the\n\nminute book it obtained from Dávila to LaPorte to be examined.                      At\n\ntrial, LaPorte testified that the minutes dating from 1995-2003,\n\nincluding all meetings relating to the Health Plan loans, were\n\n\n\n24\n   Of particular note, Counts 137 and 138 charged Lugo and Román\nwith misapplying funds from the Old Health Plan (specifically,\nchecks of $1,000 and $43,063) to purchase a \"2003 Jaguar X-Type\n. . . for the personal use of defendant Lugo.\"\n\n                                          -27-\n\flikely not authored on the dates presented.          In fact, he testified\n\nthat the evidence \"strongly support[ed]\" the conclusion that the\n\nminutes in question, including the loan minutes, were all created\n\nat the same time, rather than over the course of eight years.\n\n              In June 2006, following a seven-week jury trial, all of\n\nthe Defendants except Carrasquillo were convicted of all charges\n\nthey faced.       In September 2006, following a separate three-week\n\njury trial, Carrasquillo, who was tried separately due to illness,\n\nwas likewise convicted of all charges that pertained to him.              In\n\nDecember 2006 and February 2007, the Defendants were sentenced,\n\nwith the respective sentences ranging from twelve months and a day\n\n(Caraballo, Andino, and Urbina) to 210 months (Lugo).\n\n              The Defendants now appeal.\n\n                              II.    Discussion\n\nA.   Sufficiency of Evidence\n\n              The Defendants raise a number of issues concerning the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence in support of their convictions.            \"We\n\nreview    a    sufficiency   claim   de   novo,   drawing   all   reasonable\n\ninferences in favor of the verdict to determine whether a rational\n\njury could find each element of the crime beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.\"       United States v. Scott, 564 F.3d 34, 39 (1st Cir. 2009)\n\n(citing United States v. DeCologero, 530 F.3d 36, 65 (1st Cir.\n\n2008)). In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, \"[w]e do not\n\n'weigh evidence or make credibility judgments.'\"            United States v.\n\n\n                                     -28-\n\fBristol-Mártir, 570 F.3d 29, 38 (1st Cir. 2009) (quoting United\n\nStates v. Ofray-Campos, 534 F.3d 1, 31 (1st Cir. 2008)). Moreover,\n\nwe \"'must uphold any verdict that is supported by a plausible\n\nrendition of the record.'\"      Id. at 38 (quoting Ofray-Campos, 534\n\nF.3d at 32).\n\n          1.   The Embezzlement Convictions\n\n          The Defendants contend that the evidence is insufficient\n\nto support their convictions for embezzlement.          Each was convicted\n\nunder Count I of conspiring to embezzle Health Plan funds pursuant\n\nto 18 U.S.C. § 669 and 18 U.S.C. § 371.        The Defendants were also\n\nconvicted of separate counts of substantive embezzlement under\n\n§ 669 based on payments they received from either the Union,\n\nInfrastructure, or Administrative Accounts.\n\n          18   U.S.C.    §   669,   the    basis   of   the   embezzlement\n\nconvictions, provides:\n\n          Whoever knowingly and willfully embezzles,\n          steals,   or   otherwise   without    authority\n          converts to the use of any person other than\n          the   rightful    owner,    or    intentionally\n          misapplies   any   of   the    moneys,   funds,\n          securities, premiums, credits, property, or\n          other assets of a health care benefit program,\n          shall be fined . . . or imprisoned . . . or\n          both . . . .\n\n\n\n\n                                    -29-\n\f18 U.S.C. § 669(a).      Section 669 \"remains largely untested and\n\nunanalyzed.\" Robert Fabrikant et al., Health Care Fraud § 2.02[5],\n\nat 2-34 (2009).25\n\n                    a.   \"funds .      .    .   of   a   health   care   benefit\n                         program\"\n\n          The Defendants first contend that there is insufficient\n\nevidence to establish that the transactions at issue in support of\n\nCounts 2 through 139 involved \"funds . . . of a health care benefit\n\nprogram.\"26    18 U.S.C. § 669.            They argue that, because the\n\nDefendants commingled Health Plan funds with other funds within the\n\ncustody of the Union, there is insufficient evidence to establish\n\nthat the Defendants embezzled Health Plan funds as opposed to other\n\nUnion funds.\n\n          A first reason for rejecting this contention is that the\n\ndefendants    effectively   admitted       in   their    testimony   and   their\n\narguments to the jury that the moneys they took were essentially\n\npayments to them by the Health Plan for services they rendered to\n\n\n25\n    Lugo separately argues that 18 U.S.C. § 669 is \"void for\nvagueness\" since it \"d[oes] not make . . . reasonably clear that\nthe compensation [he] received\" was prohibited. Lugo claims that\nthe Union's constitution, its collective bargaining agreement, and\nthe Plan's bylaws all failed to give him \"fair warning\" that he\ncould not take the payments that he did. His claim, however, is\nbetter understood as a sufficiency claim as to whether his conduct\nwas \"knowing and willing.\" We discuss that sufficiency claim in\nmore detail below.\n26\n    The Defendants, in supplemental briefing, concede that their\nargument as to the character of the funds does not apply to Count\n1, the conspiracy to embezzle count, and Count 140, the money\nlaundering count.\n\n                                  -30-\n\fit.   It was the Defendants' position throughout trial that as\n\nofficials of the Health Plan, they rendered numerous administrative\n\nand executive services to it for which they were entitled to\n\ncompensation,     and   that    moneys    which   are     the   basis   of   the\n\nallegations of the embezzlement were not embezzled at all but were\n\nrather taken by them as the Health Plan's proper compensation to\n\nthem for the services they rendered.          Their contention that there\n\nwas insufficient evidence to prove that the funds were Health Plan\n\nmoneys is contradicted by their own assertions that these were\n\nHealth Plan moneys.\n\n           Even    without     these   admissions,   we    would   reject    the\n\nDefendants' contention. As a threshold matter, the parties dispute\n\nwhat § 669 requires the government to show in order to prove that\n\nthe purportedly embezzled funds were \"funds . . . of a health care\n\nbenefit plan.\"27    The language of the statute does not provide any\n\nguidance, and the few cases that have concerned convictions under\n\n\n27\n   The Defendants do not dispute that the Health Plan is a \"health\ncare benefit program\" under § 669, which is defined broadly as:\n\n      [A]ny public or private plan or contract, affecting\n      commerce, under which any medical benefit, item, or\n      service is provided to any individual, and includes any\n      individual or entity who is providing a medical benefit,\n      item, or service for which payment may be made under the\n      plan or contract.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 24(b) (defining a \"health care benefit program\" for\npurposes of § 669). The definition applies with equal force to the\nOld Health Plan, and thus to the misapplication counts (Counts 133-\n39) involving those funds. Accordingly, we reject Lugo and Román's\ncontention otherwise.\n\n                                       -31-\n\f§ 669 have not addressed the government's burden in proving that\n\nembezzled funds are \"funds . . . of a health care benefit program.\"\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Whited, 311 F.3d 259 (3d Cir. 2002)\n\n(addressing sufficiency of the indictment, meaning of \"health care\n\nbenefit program,\" and Commerce Clause challenges to § 669); United\n\nStates v. Jackson, 524 F.3d 532, 534 (4th Cir. 2008), vacated on\n\nother   grounds,     129   S.   Ct.   1307     (2009)   (mentioning,     without\n\ndiscussing, conviction under § 669).\n\n            The    Defendants   point    out    that,   in    enacting   §   669,\n\nCongress did not adopt the approach of other federal statutes that\n\nrelieve the government of proving the character of the funds\n\nembezzled.      By way of contrast, the Defendants cite 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 666, which prohibits the \"embezzle[ment]\" of funds \"owned by, or\n\n. . . under the care, custody, or control of [an] organization,\n\ngovernment, or agency,\" so long as the organization received \"in\n\nany one year period, benefits in excess of $10,000 under a Federal\n\nprogram.\"    18 U.S.C. § 666(a) & (b).          By its terms, § 666 does not\n\nrequire   the     government    to    prove    that   the    funds   purportedly\n\nembezzled are, in fact, those funds provided by the \"Federal\n\nprogram\" as opposed to other funds.               In fact, the legislative\n\nhistory of § 666 shows that it was enacted precisely to deal with\n\nthe difficulty of proving the \"federal character\" of funds under\n\n\n\n\n                                       -32-\n\fthe general federal fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. § 641.28   See S. Rep.\n\nNo. 98-225, at 369 (1985), reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182,\n\n3510 (noting that § 641 required the government to show \"that the\n\nproperty stolen is property of the United States,\" which was\n\n\"impossible\" in many cases where \"the funds are so commingled that\n\nthe federal character of the funds [could] not be shown\").\n\n           By contrast, the Defendants argue that § 669 provides no\n\nsuch language.    In fact, in enacting § 669 as part of the Health\n\nInsurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, (\"HIPAA\"),\n\nsee Pub. L. No. 104-191, 110 Stat. 1936 (1996),29 Congress had the\n\nopportunity to adopt the approach taken by § 666 but chose not to.\n\nInstead, and as the government concedes, § 669 was most likely\n\n\n\n28\n     18 U.S.C. § 641 provides, in pertinent part:\n\n      Whoever embezzles, steals, purloins, or knowingly\n      converts to his use or the use of another, or without\n      authority, sells, conveys or disposes of any record,\n      voucher, money, or thing of value of the United States or\n      of any department or agency thereof, or any property made\n      or being made under contract for the United States or any\n      department or agency thereof;\n      . . .\n      Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more\n      than ten years, or both; but if the value of such\n      property in the aggregate, combining amounts from all the\n      counts for which the defendant is convicted in a single\n      case, does not exceed the sum of $1,000, he shall be\n      fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one\n      year, or both.\n29\n    At least one circuit has noted that Section 669, and HIPAA\ngenerally, were \"broad measures Congress enacted in its effort to\n'combat waste, fraud, and abuse in health insurance and health care\ndelivery.'\" Whited, 311 F.3d at 268 (citation omitted).\n\n                                -33-\n\f\"modeled after\" § 641.   See Fabrikant et al., supra, § 3.02[13], at\n\n3-114 to 3-115 (2007) (noting that § 669 was \"modeled after 18\n\nU.S.C. Section 641, which makes it a crime to embezzle, steal, or\n\nconvert property or a thing of value belonging to the United\n\nStates\"); see also Diana Douglas, Attorneys Caught in the Web of\n\nMedicare/Medicaid    Fraud,   21   J.   Legal.   Med.   395,   412   (2000)\n\n(\"Section 669 was patterned after 18 U.S.C. section 641, the\n\nfederal theft and embezzlement statute, and serves as a companion\n\nto it.\").30   Indeed, although not mirror images of each other, both\n\nset forth the character of the funds as an element of the offense.\n\n          We agree with the Defendants' premise that § 641 provides\n\nthe closest analogue to § 669.          However, we disagree with the\n\nDefendants' conclusion that embezzled dollars cannot serve as the\n\nbasis of a conviction under § 669 unless they are proven to have\n\nbeen the property of a health plan.\n\n          Like § 669, the case law interpreting § 641 is sparse,\n\nbut courts have generally not required the government to trace the\n\ndollars embezzled to a federal source.      In United States v. Gibbs,\n\nfor example, the Ninth Circuit addressed a sufficiency challenge to\n\na § 641 conviction in the context of commingled sources of funding.\n\n704 F.2d 464 (9th Cir. 1983) (per curiam).         There, the defendant\n\nfounded a corporation to \"promote educational opportunities for\n\n\n\n30\n   These secondary sources do not cite any legislative history for\nthis proposition, nor do the parties cite any.\n\n                                   -34-\n\fAmerican Indians\" that \"received most of its funds from the federal\n\ngovernment.\"   Id. at 465.   The defendant was convicted under § 641\n\ndespite the fact that the defendant \"commingled federal funds with\n\nnonfederal funds received from state and private sources.\"     Id.\n\n          The Ninth Circuit upheld the conviction, which involved\n\nmultiple counts of substantive embezzlement where \"the amount of\n\nnonfederal funds exceeded the amounts embezzled, [such that] it is\n\npossible that the funds embezzled were entirely nonfederal.\"     Id.\n\nat 465-66 (noting that the defendant was charged \"with thirty-four\n\ncounts of embezzlement under 18 U.S.C. § 641\" and that the \"jury\n\nconvicted him of twenty of the counts.\").    In doing so, the court\n\nrejected the defendant's argument that the government failed to\n\nprove \"the federal nature of the funds embezzled.\"       Id. at 465.\n\nThe court held, in particular, that the evidence was sufficient\n\nbecause (1) \"between 80-86% of the funds in the account from which\n\n[the defendant] embezzled was federal money\" and (2) \"the federal\n\ngovernment monitored and controlled these funds.\"    Id. at 466.     A\n\nnumber of other courts have adopted the same approach.    See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Evans, 572 F.2d 455, 474 (5th Cir. 1978) (holding\n\nthat the evidence sufficient to support a conviction under § 641\n\nwhere more than 75 percent of the funds in the commingled account\n\nwere federal and were \"subject to extensive federal controls\");\n\nUnited States v. Scott, 784 F.2d 787, 790-91 (7th Cir. 1986) (per\n\ncuriam) (holding evidence was sufficient to support verdict under\n\n\n                                 -35-\n\f§ 641 where 98% percent of the commingled funds were federal and\n\n\"the federal government still maintained supervision and control\n\nover the funds at the point when the funds were stolen.\").\n\n            Our case law is not to the contrary.                  Defendants cite\n\nUnited   States    v.    Elías-Rivera,      where   we    noted    that,   in   the\n\nbankruptcy context, there \"is an established presumption that\n\nwithdrawals for other than trust purposes from an account in which\n\ntrust funds are commingled with nontrust funds are presumed to be\n\nmade from nontrust funds.\"            848 F.2d 16, 19 (1st Cir. 1998).          But\n\nin that case, involving a bankruptcy trustee who commingled all of\n\nthe estates he supervised in one account, \"[t]he prosecution failed\n\nto prove that funds were even missing, much less missing from funds\n\nbelonging to the debtors,\" such that there was a \"total lack of\n\nevidence\"    to   \"rebut      [the]    presumption.\"      Id.       Elías-Rivera,\n\ntherefore, does not speak to the situation here, which concerns\n\nwhat evidence is sufficient to rebut any such presumption.\n\n            Comparing this case to Gibbs and Evans, it is clear that\n\nthe funds embezzled were \"funds . . . of a health care benefit\n\nprogram\" under § 669.           As in those cases, (1) the \"health care\n\nbenefit program\" funds were a substantial portion of the commingled\n\nfunds;   and   (2)      the   \"health    care   benefit    program\"     exercised\n\nsufficient supervision and control over the funds to preserve their\n\ncharacter.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -36-\n\f          As    the   Gibbs   court   emphasized,   \"the   government's\n\nsupervision and control . . . is the critical factor in determining\n\nthe federal character of the funds in a commingled account.\"       704\n\nF.2d at 466.   We conclude that, based on the evidence in this case,\n\nthe Health Plan had sufficient supervision and control over the\n\nHealth Plan contributions to establish that the funds embezzled\n\nwere \"funds . . . of a health care benefit program.\"\n\n          As an initial matter, the Defendants argue that the\n\nrelevant analogue to \"federal supervision and control\" in the § 669\n\ncontext is control by the AAA.    But AAA is only the contributor of\n\nthe funds.     Section 669 protects \"funds . . . of a health care\n\nbenefit plan,\" and thus, as in the context of § 641, the relevant\n\nentity for purposes of the \"supervision and control\" prong is the\n\nprotected entity. Moreover, as in Gibbs and Evans, the Health Plan\n\nwas both the source of the funds and the protected entity.        Once\n\nthe Union deposited the funds in the Plan Account, the Health Plan\n\nstood in the same position as the federal government in both\n\nproviding its funds to the Union and in being the victim of the\n\nDefendants' embezzlement.\n\n          The Defendants further argue that the Health Plan did not\n\nhave a sufficient stake in the funds such that the funds failed to\n\nretain their \"Health Plan\" character once they were diverted out of\n\nthe Health Plan Account.      In Evans, for example, the court noted\n\nthat funds in that case \"ha[d] a federal origin and a federal end,\n\n\n                                  -37-\n\fand during their outstanding circulation they [were] subject to\n\nextensive federal controls.         This [was] not the situation in which\n\nthe federal monies [were] intended as an outright grant.\" 572 F.2d\n\nat 474 (emphasis added). In particular, the Evans court noted that\n\nthe federal government (in that case the Office of Education) had\n\na sufficient stake in the funds it provided for a federal program;\n\n\"The   federal   interest   .   .   .    is    specifically   established   and\n\npreserved by the provision for termination of the program on a date\n\ncertain and the requirement that the proportionate share of the\n\nbalance in the special fund be returned to the government.\"            Id. at\n\n472; see also id. at 474 (\"It is statutorily contemplated that the\n\nultimate repayment will be to the federal government.\").\n\n           The Defendants specifically argue that, unlike in Evans,\n\nthe AAA did not have a right to recover any excess funds.                   But\n\nagain the correct analogue is the Health Plan, not the AAA, and the\n\nfunds diverted were not meant to be, even by the Defendants' own\n\nadmission, \"outright grants.\"           Rather, the Defendants contend that\n\nthe funds embezzled were for administrative services rendered, and\n\ncertainly the Health Plan had a sufficient stake in those funds to\n\nensure that the Plan received fair value for those services.                The\n\nDefendants further argue that the collective bargaining agreement\n\ndid not bar the Union from preserving any excess funds from the\n\nHealth Plan.     Even if that is true (which is doubtful), there were\n\nno excess funds to claim.           The Health Plan throughout the time\n\n\n                                        -38-\n\fperiod of the embezzlement scheme suffered significant impairments,\n\nsuch that there were no excess funds that the Union could claim as\n\nits own.     Thus, as in Evans, the Health Plan had a right to all\n\nfunds diverted by the Defendants.\n\n             The Defendants finally argue that, unlike in Gibbs and\n\nEvans,   there      was    no   equivalent       to   \"federal   regulation\"   that\n\nmandated oversight.         But there was.        As required under Puerto Rico\n\nlaw, the Defendants were fiduciarily responsible to the Plan and,\n\nthus, required to maintain oversight on how the funds were used.\n\nSee P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 1907 (\"Fiduciary liability[:] Any\n\ndirector, officer or member of a health service[ ] organization who\n\nreceives, collects, disburses or invests funds related to the\n\nactivities of said organization, shall be fiducially liable for the\n\nfunds received from the subscribers.\"); cf. FDIC v. Sea Pines Co.,\n\n692   F.2d   973,    977    (4th   Cir.    1982)      (noting    that   interlocking\n\ndirectors of two boards have a fiduciary responsibility for assets\n\nof both companies).         For all of the above reasons, we conclude that\n\nthe Health Plan exercised supervision and control of the funds,\n\nsuch that they were, in fact, Health Plan funds.\n\n             Furthermore, the Health Plan funds were a substantial\n\nportion of the commingled funds that the Defendants embezzled.                   As\n\nan initial matter, the Defendants argue that the Health Plan\n\ncontributions made by AAA did not become \"funds . . . of a health\n\ncare benefit program\" until they were actually deposited in the\n\n\n                                          -39-\n\fPlan Account.    They point to a concession made by the government in\n\nits brief in United States v. Jackson, S. Ct. No. 08-263, where the\n\ngovernment conceded that employer contributions to an ERISA plan\n\n\"themselves are not assets of [a] plan until the contributions are\n\npaid to the plan.\"       U.S. Br. at 10 (Jan. 16, 2009); see also\n\nJackson,   524    F.3d   at   543   (holding   that   \"unpaid   employer\n\ncontributions to the Company and Union Plans constituted 'assets'\n\nof the Plans under 18 U.S.C. § 664,\" the ERISA theft statute).\n\n           The concession, to the extent that it is relevant to this\n\ncase,31 does not assist the Defendants.          With respect to the\n\nconvictions occurring from 1998 to 2001, the evidence conclusively\n\n\n\n31\n    We note that Jackson differs from this case in two material\nrespects.   First, Jackson concerned whether a bare contractual\nobligation that had become due could be considered an \"asset\" for\npurposes of the ERISA theft statute. See Jackson, 524 F.3d at 544.\nIn contrast, the funds here were not just contractual obligations,\nbut actual checks that, on their face, were made out for the\nspecific purpose of funding the Health Plan. Thus, at issue here\nare not contractual obligations but actual property. Second, the\nemployer in Jackson owed no fiduciary duty to the beneficiaries of\nthe unpaid contributions. See id. at 545 (rejecting claim that\nunpaid contributions were assets of the Plan because the defendant\nemployers \"were never fiduciaries of the Plan[]\"). In contrast,\nupon receiving the checks, the Defendants in this case had a\nfiduciary duty to the Health Plan insofar as they were\nsimultaneously on the Plan's board.\n\n     We further note that the Defendants' position has absurd\nconsequences. Indeed, at oral argument, one judge on this panel\nnoted that, under the Defendants' position, the Defendants could\nnot be convicted under § 669 if they had never deposited the Health\nPlan contributions into the Plan Account at all, and just\nimmediately deposited the contributions into the Defendants'\npersonal bank accounts. Defense counsel responded that \"it does\nnot seem that I am arguing that.\"\n\n                                    -40-\n\fdemonstrated that, save for one instance, the Union transferred the\n\nentire monthly Health Plan contributions to the Plan Account.\n\nThus, there was no question that the funds subsequently diverted\n\nwere Health Plan funds. Moreover, although, beginning in 2002, the\n\nDefendants first deposited the Health Plan in the Welfare Account,\n\na substantial amount of the funds were then deposited into the Plan\n\nAccount, such that any subsequent diversion of the funds from that\n\nAccount were Health Plan funds.\n\n           Turning to the evidence, it conclusively demonstrated\n\nthat the Health Plan contributions, in the language from one\n\ndefendant's brief, \"were the largest regular deposits by far.\"\n\nBased upon the balance sheets provided by the Union, for the years\n\n1998 through 2000, the Union averaged approximately $757,543 per\n\nyear in income, which translates to a monthly gross income of\n\nroughly $63,000 per month.       In contrast, during that same time\n\nperiod, and with a contribution rate of $232 per member, the AAA\n\ncontributed   well   over   $1   million   per    month   in   Health   Plan\n\ncontributions during that time period.           This percentage alone is\n\nwell above the 75 to 80 percent threshold established in § 641\n\ncases.32   Holding the average income of the Union constant, the\n\ndisparity between the Union's average monthly income as compared to\n\n\n\n32\n   In fact, as noted in the background section above, from 1998 to\n2001 the total amount actually paid to the Defendants was similar\nin amount (or exceeded) the total amount of reported income for the\nUnion.\n\n                                  -41-\n\fthe Health Plan contributions was even greater from 2002 to 2004.\n\nDuring this time period, the rate increased dramatically, such that\n\nthe Union was receiving between $1.5 million and $2.3 million in\n\nHealth Plan contributions per month from 2002 to 2004.\n\n            The Defendants counter by arguing that the balance sheets\n\nfailed to include SINOT, retirement, and rental income, which were\n\nalso commingled with Health Plan funds.33         However, their resort to\n\nthese additional funds is unavailing. Including these amounts, the\n\nevidence showed that the Union contributed approximately $151,041\n\nper month for SINOT and approximately $78,000 per month for the\n\nretirement program, and $4,500 per month in income from renting out\n\na parking lot.        Combined with the Union's income in dues (as\n\nreflected in the average income above), the total amount of non-\n\nHealth Plan contribution income averaged approximately $300,000 per\n\nmonth.    This, again, is only a small percentage of the millions per\n\nmonth the Union was receiving in Health Plan contributions, with\n\nthe Health Plan contributions representing approximately 77% ($1\n\nmillion    out   of   $1.3   million    total)   of   the   total   amount   of\n\ncommingled funds based on the lowest Health Plan contribution.\n\n\n\n\n33\n   Like the Health Plan contributions at issue in this appeal, the\nDefendants were similarly constrained in their use of these other\nfunds. In addition, the funds were similarly not reported in the\nUnion's balance sheets.    In essence, the Defendants argue that\ntheir convictions cannot stand because they were guilty of\nembezzling different funds.\n\n                                       -42-\n\f           The   Defendants    further       counter   by   focusing   on   the\n\nspecific   accounts   from    which    the   Defendants     paid   themselves.\n\nAlthough, as a whole, the funds that the Union received in Health\n\nPlan contributions far outweighed the funds that the Union received\n\nfrom other sources, the Defendants argue that the amount of Health\n\nPlan contributions contained in the accounts vis-a-vis other funds\n\nwere not proportionally high enough to support the convictions.\n\n           For example, the Defendants point to the testimony of\n\nJennifer Griffin, who did a \"deposit source\" analysis of the funds\n\ncontained in the Infrastructure Account, as shown in the table\n\nbelow:\n\n           1998:   69% Health Plan\n                   22% SINOT\n                   9% Cultural Trips Account\n\n           1999:   74% Health Plan\n                   18% SINOT\n                   8% Cultural Trips Account\n\n           2000:   75% Health Plan\n                   16% SINOT\n                   5% Cultural Trips Account\n                   4% Union Account\n\n           2001:   47%   Health Plan\n                   27%   SINOT\n                   15%   Union Account\n                   11%   Cultural Trips Account\n\n           2002:   45% Union Account\n                   36% Health Plan\n                   16% SINOT\n                   3% Cultural Trips Account\n\n           2003:   72% Union Account\n                   15% SINOT\n                   8% Cultural Trips Account\n\n                                      -43-\n\f                    5% Health Plan\n\n          2004:     57% Investment Redemptions\n                    32% Union Account\n                    8% Health Plan\n                    3% Welfare Account\n\nAlthough for the first three years of the scheme 69 percent (1998),\n\n74 percent (1999), and 75 percent (2000) of the funds contained in\n\nthe Infrastructure Account were derived from Health Plan funds, the\n\namounts declined in 2001 to 47 percent, and further declined to 36\n\npercent (2002), 5 percent (2003), and 8 percent (2004).                 The\n\nDefendants seize on this decline to argue that, on average, the\n\npercentage of Health Plan funds contained in the Infrastructure\n\nAccount was approximately 44 percent, below the 75 to 80 percent\n\nthreshold articulated in some § 641 cases.\n\n          The     government   counters    that    the   \"deposit   source\"\n\nanalysis is somewhat misleading.          It notes that, even in those\n\nyears where the Infrastructure Account contained a small percentage\n\nof funds directly diverted from the Health Plan, it still received\n\na significant percentage of funds from the Union Account, which\n\nitself contained funds from the Health Plan. In 2003, for example,\n\nand as shown by the complicated flow charts prepared by Griffin for\n\ntrial, $19.4 million of the AAA's Health Plan contributions were\n\ndeposited into the Union Account.         From there, $14.8 million was\n\npassed into the Plan Account (via the Welfare Account), with $4.1\n\nmillion remaining in the Union Account.           And then from there, an\n\nadditional $873,000 was transferred from the Plan Account to the\n\n                                  -44-\n\fUnion Account, which resulted in the Union Account containing well\n\nover $5 million of the Health Plan's funds.            This exceeded by\n\nseveral million dollars any other sources of funds contained in the\n\nUnion Account.     Thus, the large percentage (72 percent) of Union\n\nAccount    funds   contained   in   the   Infrastructure   Account   itself\n\ncontained a large percentage of Health Plan funds, such that,\n\ncombined with the 8 percent of Health Plan funds already contained\n\nin the Infrastructure Account, Health Plan funds comprised a\n\nsubstantial portion of the funds in the Infrastructure Account.\n\nHowever, the government did not establish at trial the \"true\" total\n\npercentage of Health Plan funds contained in the Infrastructure\n\nAccount.\n\n            As the above evidence shows, and in contrast to Gibbs,\n\nthis case involves multiple accounts with commingled funds, with\n\nthose accounts funneling Health Plan funds into each other.           This\n\nscenario presents further opportunities for abuse.34 However, based\n\non our review of the specific evidence in this case, drawing all\n\nreasonable inferences in favor of the verdict, we conclude that, as\n\nin Gibbs and Evans, Health Plan funds were a substantial portion of\n\nthe funds in the commingled accounts.\n\n\n34\n   For example, one might funnel small values of embezzled funds\nthrough an account that contains mostly non-embezzled funds, such\nthat embezzled funds never comprise a substantial portion of that\naccount. Although we conclude in this case that the Infrastructure\nAccount did contain mostly Health Plan funds, as a hypothetical\nmatter, we find it difficult to believe that a defendant could\navoid liability through such a scheme.\n\n                                    -45-\n\f          First, we stress again that the disparity between the\n\nHealth Plan contributions as compared to the Union's other sources\n\nof funds was staggering.   The Union received in the realm of 70 to\n\n80 percent of its funds from Health Plan contributions, as compared\n\nto all other sources (including funds, such as SINOT and the funds\n\nfor the retirement program, that the Union was not permitted to use\n\nas income).   Moreover, and as the evidence showed, the Health Plan\n\nfunds were commingled among the accounts from which the Defendants\n\npaid themselves, such that a rational juror could conclude that, at\n\nany given time, the Accounts contained Health Plan funds.       That\n\nalone is sufficient under Gibbs to establish the \"substantial\n\nportion\" prong.\n\n          Second, we note that the 75 to 80 percent level discussed\n\nin Gibbs and Evans is not a threshold.    Indeed, the Seventh Circuit\n\nupheld a conviction under § 641 where as little as 50 percent of\n\nthe commingled funds were federal.     See United States v. Mitchell,\n\n625 F.2d 158, 161 (7th Cir. 1980) (concerning theft of check from\n\nAid to Families with Dependent Children account containing 50\n\npercent federal funds).    Thus, almost all of the years for the\n\nInfrastructure Account contained a sufficient portion of Health\n\nPlan funds.    For all of these reasons, we conclude that, as in\n\nGibbs and Evans, the evidence is sufficient to show that the Health\n\nPlan funds were a substantial portion of the funds embezzled from\n\nthe commingled sources.\n\n\n                                -46-\n\f          Based on the above, we conclude that the evidence was\n\nsufficient in this case to permit a rational jury to convict the\n\nDefendants for each of the substantive embezzlement counts.\n\n                       b.     \"without authority\"\n\n          Defendants   next    contend   that   there    was   insufficient\n\nevidence to prove that they were \"without authority\" to receive the\n\nHealth Plan funds. The Defendants argue that they were entitled to\n\nadditional compensation for the work they performed on behalf of\n\nthe Health Plan, and that this compensation was authorized by the\n\ncollective bargaining agreement, the constitution, the Plan bylaws,\n\nand \"historical practice.\"\n\n          We conclude that the evidence was sufficient in this case\n\nto establish that the Defendants acted \"without authority.\"             We\n\nstress at the outset that the issue is not whether the Defendants\n\nwere anywhere explicitly prohibited from receiving payments from\n\nthe Health Plan for services rendered; rather, the issue is whether\n\nthey lacked the authority to do so.      See United States v. Hammond,\n\n201 F.3d 346, 349 (5th Cir. 1999) (per curiam) (although union\n\npresident did not \"break any law or union rule\" in spending\n\npolitical funds, court affirmed conviction because a \"rational\n\njuror\" could conclude that expenditure was unauthorized).           And, in\n\nthis case, the Defendants lacked such authority.\n\n          The   Defendants      first     point     to    the     purported\n\n\"administrative services\" contract they provided to OIC, but that\n\n\n                                  -47-\n\fis a nonstarter.      The evidence at trial showed that the contract\n\nwas replete with irregularities, overcharged for services, was\n\ncreated after the fact, was ultimately rejected by the OIC, and the\n\ngovernment     provided   evidence     that   the   minutes    supporting    the\n\ncontract   were    forged.       The   Defendants    claimed    that   the   OIC\n\n\"mistakenly\" rejected the contract \"on the assumption that [the\n\nDefendants] could not receive such compensation because they were\n\npaid labor license.\"      Even if true (which it is not, as detailed in\n\nthe OIC rejection letter), the contract was nonetheless rejected,\n\nand cannot authorize the Defendants' actions in this case.\n\n           The Defendants further point to a number of provisions in\n\nthe Health Plan bylaws, the constitution, and the collective\n\nbargaining agreement that would permit compensation or at least not\n\nprohibit it.      For example:\n\n           *         The Health Plan bylaws establish the authority of\n                     the board of directors to \"set[] salaries of\n                     officials\";\n\n           *         The constitution states that \"the [CEC] will fix\n                     the representative expenses and the bonuses of\n                     the Union's Officers\";\n\n           *         The collective bargaining agreement puts Lugo in\n                     charge of \"managing and directing the rendering\n                     of services.\"\n\nThese provisions, if exercised, may have provided authority for the\n\nDefendants' compensation.         But there was no evidence, such as a\n\nformal resolution, meeting minutes, or any other documentation that\n\n\n\n\n                                       -48-\n\fshowed that the Defendants exercised those provisions. Thus, these\n\nprovisions cannot supply the necessary authority for their actions.\n\n          The Defendant next argue that, as a matter of practice,\n\nthey received compensation for the services they provided for the\n\nHealth Plan.     They point to the testimony of Rubén Luciano, who\n\ntestified that, under the Old Health Plan, \"there was always\n\ncompensation paid to the Board of Directors.\"             But this purported\n\nhistorical     practice    lacks      any    formal   resolution   or        other\n\nauthorization.      Moreover, unlike the Old Health Plan, the Health\n\nPlan was subject to Puerto Rico's Insurance Code, and under the\n\nCode the Health Plan was required to seek approval from the OIC,\n\nand to \"furnish to the Commissioner the adequate information to\n\njustify   the\"      delegation   of    administrative     services      to    the\n\nDefendants.      See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 1905(2)(a).                    The\n\nevidence showed that the Defendants failed to do so in this case,\n\nand thus they cannot resort to their historical practice as a\n\nsource of authority.\n\n          Finally, the Defendants challenge testimony given by\n\nAurea López, the OIC's chief investigator into the Union's scheme,\n\nconcerning    the    Defendants'   labor     license.35    At   trial,       López\n\ntestified to the following:\n\n\n\n\n35\n   The Defendants do not present this challenge as a separate basis\nfor reversal, but as part and parcel of their claim that the\nevidence establishing their lack of authority was insufficient.\"\n\n                                      -49-\n\f           The reason for excluding those enjoying Union\n           leave is that the position held by the\n           Commissioner of Insurance is that those\n           persons were already being compensated by AAA\n           so that they could offer services to the\n           Union. So we understood that it was also not\n           correct that the [Health Plan] be charged for\n           services that these people rendered to the\n           [Health Plan].\n\nThe   Defendants   claim   that   López    provided   unqualified   opinion\n\ntestimony to the effect that the labor license prohibited the\n\nDefendants from receiving additional compensation for their work on\n\nthe Health Plan.      See Fed. R. Evid. 702 (permitting opinion\n\ntestimony if \"(1) the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or\n\ndata, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and\n\nmethods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods\n\nreliably to the facts of the case\").        The Defendants point out that\n\nLópez was not established as an expert on the Union's activities to\n\nopine on the labor license.       The government argues that, when read\n\nin context, López was only giving testimony on historical fact as\n\nto the OIC's conclusion that the Defendants' six percent charges\n\nfor services were unreasonable in light of prevailing market rates.\n\n           We need not decide the issue, because any error in\n\nadmitting the testimony was harmless, because it would not have\n\n\"affected the outcome of the trial.\"        United States v. Dunbar, 553\n\nF.3d 48, 59 (1st Cir. 2009)(\"'The essential inquiry in harmless\n\nerror review is whether the improperly admitted evidence likely\n\naffected the outcome of the trial.'\" (quoting United States v. Tom,\n\n\n                                    -50-\n\f330 F.3d 83, 95 (1st Cir. 2003)).                    As noted above, there was no\n\nevidence of any authorization for the payments the Defendants\n\nreceived.      The Defendants claim prejudice because, they argue, the\n\ngovernment relied upon López's testimony at trial in support of its\n\ntheory that the Union's labor license precluded compensation for\n\nHealth Plan work, and even cited it in their closing.                        However, the\n\ngovernment      argued       below,    as    here,        that   no     provision   in   the\n\nconstitution, collective bargaining agreement, the Health Plan by-\n\nlaws, or any other document provided authority for the payments.\n\nMoreover,       no   mention     was       made   of      López's       testimony   in   the\n\ngovernment's closing.            Thus, for all of the above reasons, the\n\nevidence was sufficient to permit a rational jury to conclude\n\nbeyond    a    reasonable      doubt       that     the    Defendants       acted   without\n\nauthority.\n\n                        c.    \"knowingly and willfully\"\n\n               The    Defendants       finally       argue       with    respect    to   the\n\nembezzlement convictions that the government had not met their\n\nburden to prove that the Defendants acted with the requisite\n\ncriminal intent to be convicted of embezzlement.\n\n               To    establish    an       individual       defendant's      willing     and\n\nknowing       participation      in    a    conspiracy       as     in    this   case,   the\n\ngovernment \"need not prove that [he] knew all the details . . . or\n\nparticipated in all of the objectives . . . of the conspiracy.\"\n\nUnited States v. Brandon, 17 F.3d 409, 428 (1st Cir. 1994).                              The\n\n\n                                             -51-\n\fprosecution need only \"show knowledge of the basic agreement,\" with\n\n\"an intent to commit the underlying substantive offense.\" Id. The\n\nrequisite    knowledge           and      intent        can     be    proven    through\n\n\"circumstantial evidence, including inferences from . . . acts\n\ncommitted    by     the       defendant    that    furthered         the    conspiracy's\n\npurposes.\"    Id.\n\n            With respect to the Top Four Defendants, the evidence of\n\ntheir knowledge and willfulness with respect to the embezzlement\n\nconvictions was more than sufficient.                   They all essentially argue\n\nthat their actions were done in good faith.                     However, the evidence\n\nconclusively contradicts this assertion.\n\n            We start with Lugo and Román.                     Among other things, the\n\nevidence showed that Lugo and Román, as president and treasurer of\n\nboth the Union and the Health Plan, had signing authority over all\n\nof the bank accounts at issue in this case, and thus signed all of\n\nthe checks and other documents authorizing the transfer of funds to\n\nand from various bank accounts.             Lugo and Román also signed off on\n\nregular checks made out to themselves and the other Defendants\n\nwhich were deposited into personal accounts.                         Their consenting\n\nsignatures are also on Health Plan tax returns that omitted these\n\npayments.\n\n            Lugo and Román were also instrumental in the creation of\n\nthe administrative services contract, under which the Union leaders\n\npaid   themselves         a    six     percent     of    Health      Plan    funds   for\n\n\n                                          -52-\n\fadministering the Health Plan.                They also provided vague and\n\nmisleading responses about the specifics of the contract during the\n\ncourse of the OIC's investigation. The administration contract was\n\nultimately found to be invalid by the OIC after it was discovered\n\nthat the fees the Union charged were substantially above market\n\nrates and concerns about the legitimacy of the arrangement were\n\nuncovered. Despite being informed of this decision, Lugo and Román\n\ncontinued issuing personal payments from Union controlled funds,\n\nwhich further showed their intent.             Cf. Young, 955 F.2d at 103-04\n\n(evidence sufficient to show intent to embezzle where defendant's\n\n\"falsification\" to a government agency \"reveal[ed] a consciousness\n\nof   guilt\"    (quotation      omitted)).      Thus,   through     all   of   these\n\nactions, both Lugo and Román displayed knowledge and willfulness\n\nwith respect to the embezzlement scheme in this case.\n\n              The same is largely true of the actions of Carrasquillo.\n\nEven though he lacked signing authority, Carrasquillo controlled\n\nthe Union and Health Plan accounts after Román's retirement in\n\nApril 2004. He was also consistently obstructive when the OIC made\n\ninquiries into the administrative services contract.                 These facts\n\nwould permit a reasonable jury to conclude that Carrasquillo was\n\nknowingly involved in an embezzlement scheme.\n\n              García,   like    Lugo   and    Carrasquillo,       also   played   a\n\nsignificant     role    in   the   implementation      of   the   administrative\n\nservice contract.       Although she insists that she was cooperative\n\n\n                                       -53-\n\fwith the OIC in her investigation, which she asserts is proof that\n\nshe did not have the intent to embezzle, her role in creating the\n\nadministrative contract itself (and providing the forged minutes to\n\nsupport the contract) provides substantial evidence of her intent.\n\n          Most   importantly,    none    of   the   Top   Four   Defendants\n\nincluded any of the income they received as compensation from the\n\nHealth Plan in their tax returns and, when confronted with evidence\n\nof their scheme, promptly reported the income, literally within\n\ndays of each other.   That alone is significant evidence of their\n\nknowledge and willfulness.      See United States v. Fusaro, 708 F.2d\n\n17, 21 (1st Cir. 1983) (\"Fusaro's active participation in so many\n\naspects of the scheme as well as his attempts to cover up the\n\nscheme as it unraveled, likewise, provides the basis for the\n\ninference that he acted with the requisite intent and knowledge.\").\n\n          The Top Four Defendants each argue that their failure to\n\nfile taxes on their Health Plan income is evidence of tax evasion,\n\nbut not of embezzlement.    However, as noted below, the jurors were\n\ninstructed that \"the case that is before us . . . has nothing to do\n\nwith tax evasion,\" and jurors are presumed to follow instructions.\n\nSee United States v. Bradshaw, 281 F.3d 278, 285 (1st Cir. 2002)\n\n(\"[I]t is routinely presumed that jurors will follow curative\n\ninstructions . . . .\").    In any event, the Defendants conveniently\n\nonly failed to report their Health Plan income, thus permitting a\n\n\n\n\n                                  -54-\n\frational jury to conclude that the Defendants were not simply\n\nengaging in tax evasion.\n\n            The issue is much closer with respect to the Chapter\n\nPresident    Defendants.        As    noted   below,    the    evidence    was\n\ninsufficient to support their convictions for money laundering\n\nbecause minutes establishing their knowledge turned out to be\n\nforged.     Moreover, unlike the Top Four Defendants, the Chapter\n\nPresidents had no authority over any of the Union-controlled\n\naccounts.\n\n            The   government    does    not   dispute   that    the   Chapter\n\nPresident Defendants' role in the crime was more limited than that\n\nof the other Defendants, but argues that the evidence was still\n\nsufficient to establish their intent.           The government primarily\n\nargues that the Defendants were willfully blind to the scheme, and\n\npoints out that the district court in this case provided a willful\n\nblindness instruction.36       The government points out that, despite\n\nthe forged minutes, García certified to the OIC that \"all . . .\n\nmembers\" of the Health Plan's board of directors \"discuss[ed] and\n\nanalyze[d]    the   diversity    of    administrative    issues    of     their\n\nincumbency on a daily basis.\"         The government also points out that\n\nClotilde Díaz, who ran the Union's cafeteria, testified that \"all\"\n\n\n36\n    It is unclear whether the Defendants challenged the willful\nblindness instruction as a separate ground for reversal. To the\nextent that they did, any such error was harmless because, as\ndiscussed below, the evidence was sufficient to support their\ndirect knowledge of the scheme.\n\n                                      -55-\n\fthe Defendants would have lunch together \"every day whenever they\n\nwere there.\"    The government finally points out that the Health\n\nPlan's bylaws required the Defendants to \"manage[]\" the Plan and\n\n\"oversee[] the faithful compliance with the laws and regulations\n\napplicable to the operation of\" the Health Plan, such that the jury\n\ncould infer that the Chapter President Defendants knew that there\n\nwas nothing that authorized them to receive payments.\n\n           The Chapter President Defendants respond by pointing out\n\nthat García's certification is far from credible. Moreover, Díaz's\n\ntestimony, to the extent that it can be interpreted to mean that\n\nthe Defendants ate lunch \"every day,\" was belied by the lunch\n\ntickets presented at trial, which only showed that they met with\n\nthe Top Four Defendants infrequently, if at all.\n\n           The evidence in support of willful blindness is sparse,\n\nat best.    Willful blindness requires evidence that the Chapter\n\nDefendants were \"trying to deliberately avoid knowledge\" of the\n\nscheme, see United States v. Azubike, 564 F.3d 59, 68 (1st Cir.\n\n2009), and the government can only muster a few meetings with the\n\nTop Four Defendants and some duties on the part of the Chapter\n\nPresident Defendants to manage the Health Plan.             None of these\n\nactions    conclusively   show     the     Chapter   President    Defendants\n\n\"deliberately avoid[ing]\" knowledge of the embezzlement.\n\n           However,   like   the   Top     Four   Defendants,    the   Chapter\n\nPresident Defendants failed to report the income they received from\n\n\n                                    -56-\n\fthe Health Plan in their tax returns, even though the purported\n\nHealth Plan income was far greater than the other income they\n\nreported. More importantly, and also like the Top Four Defendants,\n\nthey all proceeded to report their payments simultaneously at a\n\ntime when the OIC was discovering the extent of the scheme.               This,\n\nalong with the other evidence, was sufficient for the jury to\n\nconclude by proof beyond a reasonable doubt the element of criminal\n\nintent.    The Chapter President Defendants argue that they did not\n\nknow that they had to report the payments and, at worst, only\n\nengaged in tax evasion.          Although that is one view of their\n\nactions, the jury was permitted to conclude that the confluence of\n\nevents here established their knowledge and willfulness by proof\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. See United States v. Dwinells, 508 F.3d\n\n63, 74 (1st Cir. 2007) (\"When the record is fairly susceptible of\n\ntwo    competing    scenarios,   the   choice   between     those   scenarios\n\nordinarily is for the jury.\").\n\n            2.     The Money Laundering Convictions\n\n            Defendants also challenge the sufficiency of the evidence\n\nin support of their money laundering convictions under 18 U.S.C.\n\n§§    1956(a)(1)(A)(i),    (a)(1)(B)(i),   &    (h).   18    U.S.C.   §   1956\n\nprovides, in relevant part:\n\n            [w]hoever, knowing that the property involved\n            in a financial transaction represents the\n            proceeds of some form of unlawful activity,\n            conducts or attempts to conduct such a\n            financial transaction which in fact involves\n            the proceeds of specified unlawful activity[,]\n\n                                   -57-\n\f             . . . knowing that the transaction is designed\n             in whole or in part . . . to conceal or\n             disguise the nature, the location, the source,\n             the ownership, or the control of the proceeds\n             of the specified unlawful activity[,] . . .\n             shall be sentenced to a fine . . . or\n             imprisonment . . . or both.\n\n18   U.S.C.    §   1956(a)(1)(B)(i);      see   also   United    States   v.\n\nCruzado-Laureano, 404 F.3d 470, 483 (1st Cir. 2005) (discussing\n\nelements of money laundering).\n\n             As an initial matter, the government concedes that the\n\nmoney laundering convictions of the Chapter President Defendants --\n\nCaraballo, Andino, Martínez, Ramos, Vázquez, Urbina, and Roldán --\n\nmust be reversed for insufficient evidence, as a result of the\n\nexpert   testimony   that   the   meeting   minutes,    upon    which   their\n\nknowledge of the money laundering scheme was based, were forgeries.\n\nThus, we only address the claims of the Top Four Defendants.\n\n             To recap, the money laundering convictions were based on\n\nloans provided to the Health Plan by the Union through the Welfare\n\nAccount.      Because the Welfare Account (which did not appear in\n\neither the Union or Health Plan books) consisted solely of Health\n\nPlan contributions, the Health Plan, in effect, was loaning money\n\nto itself.     These \"fake\" loans were an attempt to launder the Plan\n\nfunds for use by the Defendants, since the money paid back to the\n\nUnion by the Health Plan, in the government's words, \"would look\n\nlike fulfillment of a legitimate loan obligation,\" plus interest to\n\nboot.    To further conceal the scheme, Lugo, Román, and García\n\n\n                                   -58-\n\fsubmitted paperwork to the OIC authorizing the Health Plan's\n\nadministrator      to   seek   the    loans       in   question.      The    paperwork\n\nrepresented that the Union would be lending Union funds, which was\n\nnot the case, as transaction records show that the money came from\n\nthe Welfare Account.        When Luciano, the Health Plan's accountant,\n\npointed out the misrepresentation, he was fired.                      Moreover, the\n\ngovernment's documents expert, LaPorte, testified that the Health\n\nPlan's minute book was doctored to reflect meetings that were never\n\nheld.\n\n             Román and Lugo argue that their convictions should be set\n\naside in light of United States v. Santos, 128 S. Ct. 2020 (2008),\n\nwhere   a   plurality      concluded       that     the    term    \"proceeds\"      under\n\n§ 1956(a)(1) means \"profits\" rather than \"receipts.\"                        See id. at\n\n2031.   There is some question whether Santos applies to this case.\n\nSantos concerned money laundering convictions based on payments to\n\nwinners     and   employees    of     an    illegal       gambling   operation,     and\n\napplying the money laundering statute to such essential steps of\n\nthe gambling operation raised a significant merger problem.                          Id.\n\n2026.   Such a merger problem is not present here, where the \"fake\n\nloan\" scheme was in addition to the Defendants' embezzlement\n\nscheme, was not essential to it, and was concocted after the\n\nembezzlement      scheme   was   in    effect.          Moreover,    there    is   some\n\nquestion as to the holding of Santos, since Justice Stevens, the\n\nfifth and deciding vote, suggested in concurrence that the holding\n\n\n                                           -59-\n\fmay vary by offense and the legislative history.              See id. at 2032-\n\n33; see also United States v. Kratt, No. 08-5831, 2009 WL 2767152,\n\nat *4 (6th Cir. Sept. 2, 2009) (interpreting Santos to apply when\n\napplication of § 1956 \"creates a merger problem that leads to a\n\nradical increase in the statutory maximum sentence and only when\n\nnothing in the legislative history suggests that Congress intended\n\nsuch an increase\").       But even if Santos applied, the transactions\n\nat issue clearly concerned the \"profits\" of the embezzlement\n\nscheme, given the large amounts of Health Plan funds diverted and\n\nthe minimal expenses to do it.             See Santos, 128 S. Ct. at 2029\n\n(stating   that    \"to    establish    the    proceeds     element    under   the\n\n'profits' interpretation, the prosecution needs to show only that\n\na single instance of specified unlawful activity was profitable and\n\ngave rise to the money involved in a charged transaction\").\n\n           Román   and     Lugo,   along     with   the   remaining    Top    Four\n\nDefendants Carrasquillo and García, also argue that they did not\n\nembezzle Health Plan funds at all, let alone engage in money\n\nlaundering.   For the reasons discussed above, we reject the claim.\n\nLugo and Román separately argue that only a \"bumbling bunch of\n\nconspirators would conspire to hide proceeds of an activity they\n\nknew to be illegal by writing themselves checks and cashing them in\n\ntheir own names.\"        But that is no defense.          See United States v.\n\nMajors, 196 F.3d 1206, 1214 (11th Cir. 1999) (\"Moving money through\n\na large number of accounts\" may suffice to prove money laundering\n\n\n                                      -60-\n\feven where the defendant \"withdr[aws] [funds from accounts] in his\n\nown name\") (citations omitted); United States v. Sutera, 933 F.2d\n\n641, 648 (8th Cir. 1991) (\"[T]he money laundering statute does not\n\nrequire the jury to find that [the defendant] did a good job\n\nlaundering the proceeds.\"). Carrasquillo argues that he opened the\n\nWelfare Account to avoid fines for depositing unapproved rates.\n\nHis actions betray this excuse, as Carrasquillo could have simply\n\nasked   for    an   approved   rate,   the    Defendants   continued   to   use\n\nunapproved rates after establishment of the Welfare Account, and\n\nthe Union was fined anyway.            Thus, a rational jury could have\n\nconcluded beyond a reasonable doubt that Carrasquillo created this\n\nexcuse to conceal the loan scheme.              We thus conclude that the\n\nevidence was more than sufficient to support the money laundering\n\nconvictions with respect to the Top Four Defendants.\n\nB.   Jury Instructions\n\n              Defendants   also   challenge     several    jury   instructions\n\nprovided at trial.      As we have previously stated,\n\n              We review a properly preserved objection to\n              \"the form and wording\" of an instruction given\n              by the district court for abuse of discretion.\n              United States v.

Embezzlement Instruction\n\n            The Defendants first challenge certain portions of the\n\ndistrict   court's     \"legal     background\"      as     part    of    the   court's\n\ninstruction concerning 18 U.S.C. § 669.               They do not challenge the\n\ninstructions on the elements of § 669 themselves.                       Rather, the\n\nDefendants      challenge   the   following:       (a)      the   district    court's\n\ninstruction that AAA's contributions were Health Plan assets for\n\npurposes of § 669; (b) the district court's instruction with\n\nrespect    to    commingling;     and     (c)   its      instruction     concerning\n\n\"fiduciary principles.\"\n\n                     a.     instruction   that    AAA's                contributions\n                            belonged to Health Plan\n\n            The Defendants challenge the following instruction given\n\nby the district court:\n\n            [T]he [H]ealth [P]lan had a vested property\n            interest     in    [the    AAA's    monthly]\n            contributions[,] such [that] they constitute\n\n                                        -63-\n\f            health plan assets under 18 U.S. Code, Section\n            669.\n\nThe Defendants argue that, by instructing the jury that the Plan\n\nhad a \"vested property interest\" in the AAA monthly contributions,\n\nthe district court took from the jury \"an essential element of the\n\ngovernment's case.\" For support, the Defendants cite United States\n\nv. Alessio, where we reversed and remanded for a new trial when the\n\ndistrict court made a \"finding\" during the relevant witness's\n\ntestimony     that   the     specific       funds    the    defendant       allegedly\n\nmisdirected under Section 641 were \"the property of the United\n\nStates.\"      439    F.2d    803,     804   (1st    Cir.   1971)     (per    curiam).\n\nMoreover, the Defendants argue that the instruction is at odds with\n\nthe government's concession in Jackson that employer contributions\n\nto an ERISA plan \"themselves are not assets of [a] plan until the\n\ncontributions are paid to the plan.\"                Jackson, S. Ct. No. 08-263,\n\nU.S. Br. at 10.\n\n            This case is distinguishable from Alessio.                      Unlike in\n\nAlessio, the district court did not instruct the jury that the\n\nfunds the Defendants actually embezzled were Health Plan funds.\n\nRather, and as the government correctly points out, the district\n\ncourt simply described that the AAA contributions generally were\n\nfor   the   Health   Plan,      and   specifically      charged      the    jury   with\n\ndetermining    \"beyond      a   reasonable     doubt\"      whether    the    specific\n\n\"payments that came into the . . . possession of the defendants\"\n\nwere Plan funds.         Cf. Evans, 572 F.2d at 471, 473 (in § 641\n\n                                        -64-\n\fembezzlement case, affirming use of jury instruction describing\n\n\"federal character of the monies generally involved\").\n\n          However, the instruction is in some tension with the\n\ngovernment's concession in Jackson.       Although here we express some\n\ndoubt that Jackson applies to this case, we conclude that any error\n\nwas harmless.     First, and as noted above, the district court did\n\nnot instruct the jury as to any element of the offense, and thus\n\nthe Defendants were free to argue their theories to the jury.\n\nSecond, and as discussed in more detail above, at all relevant\n\ntimes most or all of the Health Plan contributions were, in fact,\n\ndeposited in the Plan Account to conclusively establish that the\n\nHealth Plan had a \"vested property interest\" in the funds.\n\n                   b.   commingling instruction\n\n          The   district   court   instructed   that,   \"[b]ecause   the\n\n[H]ealth [P]lan fund[s] [were] not . . . [U]nion property,\" they\n\n\"should not\" as a general matter have been \"commingled with other\n\n[U]nion funds.\"    It went on to say:\n\n          [t]he mere fact that funds may have been\n          transferred from other accounts or commingled\n          with other [U]nion funds is not enough to\n          create criminal liability. Such co[m]mingling\n          could have occurred for a number of reasons,\n          such as bad advice from accountants, bad\n          management practices on the part of some\n          officer or officers, or because of mistakes or\n          other innocent reasons.\n\n          But when the diversion is knowingly and\n          willfully made into other [U]nion accounts,\n          unrelated to the [H]ealth [P]lan, with intent\n          to embezzle or with intent to resupply [Union\n\n                                   -65-\n\f            money], then we [have] conduct that may\n            constitute a federal offense under 18 U.S.\n            Code, Section 669.\n\n\"[A]t the risk of repetition,\" the court further stated:\n\n            remember that the commingling of funds\n            standing alone, without proof of criminal\n            intent proven beyond a reasonable doubt,\n            cannot . . . give rise to criminal liability.\n            Precisely and for this reason, the government\n            must prove beyond a reasonable doubt, by\n            either direct or . . . circumstantial\n            evidence[,] that the commingling of funds was\n            part of the criminal plan to embezzle [P]lan\n            funds, monies or assets.      Proof beyond a\n            reasonable doubt of each and every element of\n            the offense charged is required for the\n            government to establish that [the] charged\n            conduct is criminal in nature[,] and that of\n            course is for you to decide.\n\nThe   Defendants     contend   that     the   district   court     improperly\n\ninstructed the jury that commingling is illegal per se.38             But the\n\nplain terms of the charge did not provide such an instruction.            The\n\ndistrict court did not instruct the jury that commingling is per se\n\nillegal.     Instead, as shown above, the district court repeatedly\n\nemphasized    that   \"[t]he    mere    fact   that   funds   may   have   been\n\ntransferred from other accounts or commingled with other [U]nion\n\nfunds is not enough to create criminal liability.\"                 (Emphasis\n\nadded).    We thus reject the Defendants' claim.\n\n\n\n\n38\n   García and Vázquez argue that the government argued in closing\nthat commingling itself \"made the receipt of all compensation by\n[the defendants] illegal.\" However, they cite no transcript page\nfor that claim, and we cannot find any record of it.\n\n                                      -66-\n\f                       c.   \"legal principles\" instruction\n\n              The Defendants challenge a \"legal principles\" instruction\n\nthat the district court provided sua sponte.          The district court\n\ninstructed the jury that:\n\n                     When persons hold money in trust for\n              other persons, or for particular purposes,\n              they have a fiduciary duty to use the trusted\n              funds in good faith and in a scrupulous\n              manner, acting always in the best interests of\n              the beneficiaries.\n\n                     Duties   general   to   any   fiduciary\n              relationship arise when the trust in question\n              is, as here, a health care benefit program.\n              You, the jury, may consider in your evaluation\n              of the evidence whether and to what extent the\n              government has proven beyond a reasonable\n              doubt in this case that these fiduciary rules\n              were or were not followed.\n\n                     And there are some rules I'm going to\n              give you as guidelines. These may not be the\n              only rules. You may think of other rules or\n              principles that are so obvious that I may not\n              even put in here to give you some aid in\n              figuring this out.\n\nThe   court     then   provided   a   non-exclusive   list   of   fiduciary\n\nprinciples that the jury could \"consider\" in determining whether\n\nthe government had \"prove[n] beyond a reasonable doubt\" that a\n\nparticular defendant acted \"knowingly and willfully [with] the\n\nintent to embezzle.\"        The court stated, in full:\n\n                     There are some rules that you may\n              consider in determining whether any of the\n              charged conduct was willfully, knowingly and\n              intentionally   made  for   the  purpose  of\n              violating the law, or whether the charged\n              conduct was entered into by mistake, bad\n              management or other innocent reasons.\n\n                                      -67-\n\f       Remember that bad management, careless\nor innocent reasons by themselves do not\nconstitute a crime.      Repeating myself a\nsecond: The government must prove beyond a\nreasonable doubt that the conduct charged in\nthe indictment was knowingly and willfully\nperformed, that is to say, the intent to\nembezzle or misapply as contemplated in 18\nU.S. Code, Section 669.\n\n       The first rule that may assist you in\nfiguring out whether criminal intent exists or\ndoes not exist is what can be defined as the\n\"solely-in-the-interest rule.\"      This rule\nrequires that management of health plan\ncontributions be solely in the interests of\nthe participants and the beneficiaries.\n\n       The second rule that may assist you in\nfiguring out whether criminal intent existed\nor not is the \"exclusive person rule.\" This\nrule requires that the management of the\nhealth plan contributions, or the health plan\ncontributions be for the exclusive purpose of\nproving benefits to the participants and their\nbeneficiaries; and also for the defraying\nreasonable expense of administering plan.\n\n       The third rule that you can use in the\nprocess of assessing whether criminal intent\nor noncriminal reasons were behind the charged\nconduct is the \"prudent person rule.\" Members\nof the board of directors of the health plan\nmust be prudent persons, executing their\nfiduciary duties with care, skill, prudence,\nunder the circumstances then prevailing. The\nprudent person rule requires the trustees to\nbe familiar with the matters of the enterprise\nfor which they act.\n\n       The fourth rule that may assist you in\nfiguring out whether criminal intent exists,\nor whether there was no criminal intent in the\ncharged actions, is what I refer to as the\n\"plan documents rule.\" Plan documents include\nmanagerial   organization    charts,   written\ndescriptions of authorized positions, written\ndescriptions of duties for each position,\n\n                    -68-\n\f           employment contracts, and any scope that these\n           employment contracts may contain, Board of\n           Directors' decisions and minutes under the\n           legal structure of the plan under its\n           corporate     bylaws,     and    any     other\n           contemporaneous document that confirms or\n           denies that the management decisions were made\n           and contemplated as the exclusive purpose,\n           providing benefits to the participants and\n           their beneficiaries and defraying reasonable\n           expenses of administration.\n\n                   The fiduciary must act in accordance\n           with the documents and instruments governing\n           the health plan insofar as such documents and\n           instruments are consistent with the provisions\n           of law.\n\n                  To evaluate and enforce these duties in\n           the context of a criminal statute you may\n           focus not only on the merits of the\n           transaction, but also on the thoroughness of\n           the investigation made by the fiduciaries into\n           the merits of such.\n\n                  As I have already advanced, I also\n           instruct you that a good faith or a negligent\n           breach of fiduciary duties, standing alone,\n           does not create a criminal liability, but can\n           be instructed along with other factors\n           mentioned as to whether criminal intent is or\n           is not present.\n\nThe   Defendants      primarily   contend     that   the   district   court's\n\ninstruction as to fiduciary principles were \"lengthy, legally\n\nincorrect, and complex,\" such that the district court \"engrafted\"\n\ncivil   ERISA   law    onto   Section   669   and    thereby   \"relieved   the\n\nprosecution's evidentiary burden\" to prove all elements beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.       They also argue that the Defendants' actions\n\nwere authorized and that they owed no fiduciary duty, so the\n\ninstructions were misplaced.\n\n                                    -69-\n\f          We agree that the instruction is certainly \"lengthy\" and\n\n\"complex.\" Indeed, it is difficult to characterize the instruction\n\nas anything but confusing, and we do not sanction it in any way.\n\nNevertheless, \"instructions must be evaluated not in isolation but\n\nin the context of the entire charge,\" Jones, 527 U.S. at 391\n\n(citations omitted), and based upon our review of the instruction\n\nas a whole, we conclude that the instruction was harmless.   First,\n\nalthough the district court borrowed principles from the ERISA\n\ncontext, the court stated that the jurors \"may consider\" the rules.\n\nSecond, the district court repeated twice within this instruction\n\nthat \"[t]he government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that\n\nthe conduct charged in the indictment was knowingly and willfully\n\nperformed,\" and further instructed on this requirement four other\n\ntimes in the jury charge. Third, the district court instructed the\n\njury at the beginning of its instruction \"that bad management,\n\ncareless or innocent reasons by themselves do not constitute a\n\ncrime\" and at the end that \"a good faith or a negligent breach of\n\nfiduciary duties, standing alone, does not create a criminal\n\nliability.\"   Thus, read as a whole, the instruction did not result\n\nin an error warranting reversal.   Cf. United States v. Snyder, 668\n\nF.2d 686, 690-99 (2d Cir. 1982) (\"We agree with appellant that he\n\nshould not be convicted of a crime merely because he breached his\n\ncivil fiduciary duties.   But [the court] was careful to make that\n\npoint, and we have no doubt that the jury grasped it.\").\n\n\n                               -70-\n\f          2.   Money Laundering Instruction\n\n          Román,   Ramos,   and   Roldán   separately   argue   that   the\n\ndistrict court erred in instructing on the elements of money\n\nlaundering under 18 U.S.C. § 1956.         The government has conceded\n\nthat the money laundering convictions against Ramos and Roldán\n\nshould be reversed.   We thus focus on Román.\n\n          The district court gave the following instruction with\n\nrespect to money laundering:\n\n                 First, that a defendant knowingly\n          conducted or attempted to conduct a financial\n          transaction[.] . . .\n\n                 Second, [that] the defendant knew that\n          the monies or funds involv[ed] [in the]\n          financial transaction represented the proceeds\n          of some form of unlawful activity, in this\n          case the embezzlement of monies from a health\n          plan organization.\n\n                 Third, that the funds or monies\n          involved in the financial transaction did in\n          fact   represent  the   proceeds  of   [that]\n          specified [unlawful] activity[.] . . .\n\n                 Fourth, that the defendant engaged in\n          [the] financial transaction knowing that the\n          transaction was designed, in whole or in part,\n          to conceal or to disguise the nature, the\n          location, the source, the ownership or the\n          control of the proceeds of such specified\n          [unlawful] activity.\n\nBecause no defendant objected to the instruction prior to \"the jury\n\nretir[ing] to deliberating,\" we review for plain error.         See Fed.\n\nR. Crim P. 30(d) (\"A party who objects to any portion of the\n\ninstructions . . . must inform the court of the specific objection\n\n\n                                  -71-\n\fand the grounds for the objection before the jury retires to\n\ndeliberate. . . .    Failure to object in accordance with this rule\n\nprecludes    appellate    review,   except    as   permitted    under   Rule\n\n52(b).\").\n\n            There was no plain error. Román claims that the district\n\ncourt erred by only instructing the jury as to one theory of money\n\nlaundering when two were charged, instructing on \"conceal[ment]\"\n\nunder Section 1956(a)(1)(B)(i), but not on \"to promote the carrying\n\non of specified unlawful activity\" under Section 1956(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\nHowever, Román cannot show that he was prejudiced because the\n\ndistrict court failed to instruct on an alternative government\n\ntheory.    Román also claims that the instruction was \"jumbled,\" but\n\ndoes not explain how the instruction was jumbled, and we thus deem\n\nthis ground waived.      See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17\n\n(1st Cir. 1990) (\"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,\n\nunaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed\n\nwaived.\")    (citations    omitted).       Finally,   Román    cannot   show\n\nprejudice because the district court did not define \"proceeds\" as\n\n\"profits,\" see Santos, 128 S. Ct. at 2031 (defining \"proceeds\" as\n\n\"profits\" for purposes of the money laundering statute), because,\n\nas discussed above, a rational jury could find beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt that Román in fact engaged in a conspiracy to launder\n\nprofits.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -72-\n\f          3.   Good Faith Instruction\n\n          Román, Ramos, and Roldán also challenge the district\n\ncourt's instruction on good faith.    They properly preserved their\n\nclaim.   However, because they only object as to the form and\n\nwording of the instruction, we review for abuse of discretion.\n\n          The district court provided the following instruction:\n\n          In making a determination of whether a\n          defendant acted with specific criminal intent\n          to embezzle [Health Plan] funds or monies in\n          violation of Section 669 of Title 18, or to\n          conspire to violate Section 669[,] . . . you\n          may consider . . . whether or not that\n          defendant had a good faith belief that there\n          was authorization by law, and whether or not\n          that defendant had a good faith belief that\n          [his or her] use of the [Plan's] funds was in\n          furtherance of the interest of the [Plan].\n\n          The government has the burden of proving that\n          a defendant acted with the required intent[.]\n          . . .\n\n          [G]ood faith is an absolute defense to th[e]\n          charge[s]. Accordingly, the government must\n          prove in . . . the case of each defendant,\n          that [1] the defendant did not believe in good\n          faith that the use of the funds . . . would\n          benefit the [Health Plan's] participants and\n          beneficiaries[,] [and] [2] the defendant did\n          not believe in good faith that his or her use\n          of the fund[s] was authorized by the law.\n\n(Emphasis added).\n\n          Román, Ramos, and Roldán first argue that the district\n\ncourt erred because the instruction shifted the burden of proof\n\nonto the Defendants, \"requiring them to justify what the court\n\nclearly saw as some degree of wrongful conduct.\"   However, as the\n\n\n                               -73-\n\fquoted section shows, the instruction plainly explains that the\n\ngovernment had \"the burden of proving that a defendant acted with\n\nthe required intent.\"           Román, Ramos, and Roldán further argue that\n\nthe instruction \"eviscerated\" their defense that \"they had a good\n\nfaith belief that the funds were Union funds.\"                      Although the\n\ninstruction sets forth two examples of good faith conduct that the\n\njury   \"may\"       consider,     it    did   not   specifically    preclude    the\n\nDefendant's theory.         Thus, although perhaps not the most artful\n\ninstruction, the district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\nproviding it.\n\n              4.   Rejection of Tax Evasion Instruction\n\n              García, Román, Ramos, Vázquez, and Roldán all argue that\n\nthe district court erred when it failed to instruct the jury during\n\nthe jury charge that this is not a tax evasion case.                 They claim,\n\ngiven the use of tax related evidence during the government's case\n\nin chief and closing, that declining their request to repeat the\n\ninstruction prejudiced them.\n\n              During the government's case-in-chief, however, and at\n\nthe Defendants' request, the district court did instruct the jury\n\nthat   this    was    not   a    tax   evasion     case.   The    district    court\n\ninstructed as to the following:\n\n              Members of the jury, this evidence that you\n              are going to receive now regarding the income\n              tax returns, I should tell you that . . . the\n              case that is before us . . . has nothing to do\n              with tax evasion. Tax evasion is exclusively\n              under the jurisdiction of the state courts,\n\n                                         -74-\n\f           not the federal courts. And the evidence is\n           being allowed because the Government needs to\n           present evidence as part of their effort to\n           prove a number of elements in the federal\n           offenses which they think have something to do\n           with this. That is, of course, for you to\n           decide at the end of the case, on the basis of\n           the instructions that I will give you.     And\n           that is the only purpose. So this is not a\n           tax evasion case.      This is a healthcare\n           programs fraud case. That is what it is.\n\nNone of the above Defendants objected to the district court's\n\ndecision not to provide the same instruction during the jury\n\ncharge, only Caraballo did, who does not join this argument on\n\nappeal.    Thus, we review for plain error.                See Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n30(a) (\"Any party may request in writing that the court instruct\n\nthe jury on the law as specified in the request. The request must\n\nbe made at the close of the evidence or at any earlier time that\n\nthe court reasonably sets.\"); see also United States v. Harris, 104\n\nF.3d 1465, 1471 (5th Cir. 1997) (\"[T]he greater weight of authority\n\ncounsels   that    a   party   can   rely        upon   the    objection    of   his\n\ncodefendant only if he joins in the objection,\" citing cases).\n\n           The above Defendants claim prejudice, but it is difficult\n\nto see how, when the mid-trial instruction was correct, and case\n\nlaw   presumes    that   \"jurors     .   .   .    follow      the   trial   judge's\n\ninstructions.\"     United States v. Torres, 162 F.3d 6, 12 (1st Cir.\n\n1998); see also United States v. Rivera-Gómez, 67 F.3d 993, 999\n\n(1st Cir. 1995) (\"[J]urors are not children.\") overruled on other\n\ngrounds by Jones v. United States, 526 U.S. 227 (1999).                 Moreover,\n\n\n                                     -75-\n\fGarcía specifically argues that prejudice may have resulted from\n\nthe government's closing, but the government reminded the jurors in\n\nclosing that \"[t]his is not a tax evasion case.\"                  We thus see no\n\nerror.\n\nC.    Trial Procedure\n\n            The Defendants also raise a number of issues with respect\n\nto the district court's management of the trial.\n\n            1.    Mid-Trial Severance Challenge\n\n            Vázquez    separately     contends     that    the    district   court\n\nabused   its     discretion   when    it   refused    to    grant   a   mid-trial\n\nseverance based on his attorney's alleged conflict of interest.\n\nVázquez argues that he was discouraged from testifying by his\n\ncounsel as a result of this asserted conflict, affecting the\n\noutcome of the proceedings.\n\n            As    background,    Francisco    Dolz,       counsel   for    Andino,\n\ninformed the government during its case-in-chief that Angel Tapia,\n\ncounsel for Vázquez, had admitted to doctoring minutes concerning\n\nthe   Welfare    Account.       The   government     filed    a   sealed     motion\n\ninforming the district court of the allegation, and requested a\n\nhearing.       The court held a hearing that same day, with Dolz\n\ntestifying that Tapia had admitted to him that Tapia's handwriting\n\nappeared on the doctored minutes. The district court ordered Tapia\n\nto respond, and the next day Tapia declared that the allegation was\n\n\"totally untrue,\" but that the allegation created \"a conflict of\n\n\n                                      -76-\n\finterest\" that required severing Vázquez's case mid-trial.                 The\n\ndistrict court denied the motion, finding no conflict, but further\n\nrequired Tapia to respond to the allegation in writing.                   Tapia\n\nfiled a sworn statement, stating that \"I have never told attorney\n\nFrancisco Dolz expressions to the effect that I have altered any\n\nminute or any document of any kind of the [Union],\" and further\n\nstating that the allegation was based on a misunderstanding.\n\n            Vázquez appeals the denial of his mid-trial severance\n\nmotion.     Since a \"mid-trial severance is . . . an extraordinary\n\nmeasure,\" we will \"overturn [a denial for severance] only if [the\n\ncourt's] wide discretion is plainly abused.\"                United States v.\n\nSotomayor-Vázquez, 249 F.3d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 2001) (citations and\n\nquotations omitted).       Moreover, where, as here, a defendant claims\n\nthat a conflict of interest warrants a new trial, he \"must show\n\nthat the lawyer could have pursued a plausible alternative defense\n\nstrategy or tactic and that the alternative strategy or tactic was\n\ninherently in conflict with or not undertaken due to the attorney's\n\nother   interests     or   loyalties.\"     Id.   at    15   (quotation    marks\n\nomitted).\n\n            Vázquez    contends   that   Tapia's      conflict   of   interest,\n\nparticularly his purportedly doctoring the Welfare Account minutes,\n\ncaused Tapia to discourage Vázquez from testifying.                    However,\n\nVázquez's claim of \"intimidation\" has no support in the record, and\n\nVázquez does not cite to any.       Furthermore, Vázquez failed to file\n\n\n                                    -77-\n\fany pro se motion contending that Tapia discouraged him from\n\ntestifying, or claimed that he was prevented from doing so.              In any\n\nevent, the proper vehicle for relief for ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel is a motion under 28 U.S.C. § 2255, not direct appeal.                Cf.\n\nUnited States v. Genao, 281 F.3d 305, 313 (1st Cir. 2002) (\"[W]e do\n\nnot entertain ineffective assistance claims on direct appeal absent\n\nan evidentiary record that allows us to evaluate the fact-specific\n\nallegations.      The   preferable    vehicle    for     such   claims    is    a\n\ncollateral    proceeding    under     28    U.S.C.   §    2255.\")   (citation\n\nomitted).\n\n            Given the lack of any record support to substantiate\n\nVázquez's    claim,   and   the   process   afforded     to   Vázquez    by   the\n\ndistrict court, it is hard to see any abuse of discretion on the\n\npart of the district court in denying a severance. Accordingly, we\n\nhold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\nrefusing to sever mid-trial.\n\n            2.   Misstatement in Closing Argument\n\n            García and Vázquez both argue that the district court\n\nabused its discretion when it declined to grant them a new trial\n\nbased on an alleged misstatement made during the prosecution's\n\nclosing argument.\n\n            As we noted earlier, during the strike in 2004, the Union\n\npaid each of its members $300 every two weeks.                In its rebuttal\n\nclosing argument, the prosecution argued that (1) this money came\n\n\n                                    -78-\n\ffrom the Union Account; (2) the Union Account contained Health Plan\n\nfunds; and (3) the Plan thus helped pay for the strike, even though\n\nits funds were not meant for that purpose.       The prosecutor further\n\nstated:\n\n           I did my math.   And it's approximately $5.8\n           million that the [U]nion dished out for those\n           picketing workers on the lines, the striking\n           people, the people that were out. And I'm not\n           saying that those people don't deserve to get\n           monies.    I'm saying not from health care\n           funds. Where did the [U]nion get $5.8 million\n           during the strike? Where did the [U]nion get\n           the money to pay Héctor René Lugo and all\n           these people?\n\nNone of the defendants contemporaneously objected to this line of\n\nargument during the closing itself, but they all objected at a\n\nsidebar afterward.      They claimed that the argument was \"false\"\n\nbecause, according to them, the money for the picketing workers\n\ncame from a Union \"strike fund,\" not from Health Plan funds.            The\n\ndistrict court overruled the objection.\n\n           As García and Vázquez preserved their claim, we review de\n\nnovo whether the prosecution's remarks were improper.              United\n\nStates v. Nelson-Rodríguez, 319 F.3d 12, 38 (1st Cir. 2003); see\n\nalso United States v. Robinson, 473 F.3d 387, 393 (1st Cir. 2008)\n\n(\"We   review   de   novo   whether   a   challenged   statement   by   the\n\nprosecutor during closing argument was improper.\")           However, we\n\nreview for \"manifest abuse of discretion\" a district court's\n\n\"refusal to grant a new trial.\"       United States v. Potter, 463 F.3d\n\n9, 22 (1st Cir. 2006).      Even if the remarks are improper, we affirm\n\n                                   -79-\n\funless they prejudiced the defendant. United States v. Joyner, 191\n\nF.3d 47, 53 (1st Cir. 1999).   We consider the following factors in\n\nconsidering prejudice:\n\n          (1)   the   severity   of   the   prosecutor's\n          misconduct,    including   whether    it   was\n          deliberate or accidental; (2) the context in\n          which the misconduct occurred; (3) whether the\n          judge gave curative instructions and the\n          likely effect of such instructions; and\n          (4) the strength of the evidence against the\n          defendants.\n\nNelson-Rodríguez, 319 F.3d at 38 (quotation omitted).\n\n          García and Vázquez contend that the government's remarks\n\nat closing were improper, claiming that (1) the Union paid the\n\nstriking workers from \"Banco Santander [Account] No. 1310003987\";\n\n(2) that the account belonged to the Union, not the Health Plan;\n\nand (3) the Plan thus did not help pay for the strike, and the\n\nprosecution, in arguing to the contrary, had \"misstate[d] evidence\"\n\nand \"misl[e]d the jury.\" In response, the government contends that\n\n\"Banco Santander No. 1310003987\" was the Union Account, as defined\n\nin the indictment, and, since the Plan funds were diverted to that\n\nAccount, the government's remarks were factually accurate.\n\n          Even if improper, the remarks had no effect on the trial\n\noutcome, as the case concerned not how the striking workers were\n\npaid, but whether the Defendants paid themselves with money they\n\nknew did not belong to them.    At best, this is a \"stray remark\"\n\nthat is too inconsequential to warrant reversal. See United States\n\nv. Martínez-Medina, 279 F.3d 105, 119 (1st Cir. 2002). Finally, as\n\n                                -80-\n\fcorrectly noted by the government, the district court instructed\n\nthe jury that closing statements are \"not evidence.\"             Accordingly,\n\nwe   see no reversible error.\n\n             3.   Post-Trial Threats and Harassment\n\n             Caraballo, Andino, and Urbina argue that the district\n\ncourt abused its discretion in declining to grant them a new trial\n\nbased   on   their   post-trial   allegations      that   Lugo    and   others\n\ndiscouraged them, through threats and harassment, from testifying.\n\n             As   background,   the   Defendants   were   found    guilty   on\n\nJune 16, 2006.        Six months later, during a December 6, 2006\n\nsentencing hearing, Urbina alleged for the first time that Lugo and\n\nother unnamed individuals had issued veiled threats that had\n\ndiscouraged him, Caraballo, and Andino from testifying at trial on\n\ntheir own behalf.     Urbina further asserted that he, Caraballo, and\n\nAndino would have testified that they were not at the purported\n\nboard meetings concerning the loans from the Union to the Health\n\nPlan.\n\n             On February 2, 2007, Caraballo, Andino, and Urbina moved\n\nfor a new trial, arguing that the alleged threats constituted\n\n\"newly discovered evidence\" under Rule 33(b)(1) of the Federal\n\nRules of Criminal Procedure. The district court denied the motion,\n\nfinding that any threats had not been \"serious enough\" to dissuade\n\nthe defendants from testifying and that their decision not to\n\ntestify was in fact a \"strateg[ic]\" one.\n\n\n                                      -81-\n\f          Caraballo, Andino, and Urbina renew their arguments on\n\nappeal, and contend that they are entitled to a new trial.      \"We\n\nreview a district court's denial of a new trial motion for manifest\n\nabuse of discretion.\"    United States v. Del-Valle, 566 F.3d 31, 38\n\n(1st Cir. 2009). \"The remedy of a new trial must be used sparingly,\n\nand only where a miscarriage of justice would otherwise result.\"\n\nId. (citing United States v. Conley, 249 F.3d 38, 45 (1st Cir.\n\n2001)).\n\n          A defendant who seeks a new trial on the basis\n          of newly discovered evidence bears a 'weighty\n          burden' of establishing that: (1) the evidence\n          was unknown or unavailable to the defendant at\n          the time of trial; (2) failure to learn of the\n          evidence was not due to lack of diligence by\n          the defendant; (3) the evidence is material\n          and not merely cumulative or impeaching; and\n          (4) the emergence of the evidence will\n          probably result in an acquittal upon retrial\n          of the defendant.\n\nId.\n\n          There was no abuse of discretion. First, if their claims\n\nof threats were true, then obviously they would have known about\n\nthe threats during trial.     Thus, their evidence cannot be \"newly\n\ndiscovered,\" as they cannot claim that the threats were \"unknown or\n\nunavailable to [them] at the time of trial.\"   See United States v.\n\nWright, 625 F.2d 1017, 1019 (1st Cir. 1980).    Second, they cannot\n\nshow any prejudice.     This is because their claim that they would\n\nhave testified that they did not participate in purported board\n\nmeetings concerning the loans from the Union to the Health Plan\n\n\n                                -82-\n\fwould have supported the government's theory that these meetings\n\nnever occurred and that minutes over those loan meetings were\n\ndoctored.\n\nD.   Sentencing\n\n            Finally, some of the Defendants appeal their sentences.\n\nAs a threshold matter, the government concedes that, because the\n\nconvictions for the Seven Chapter Presidents for money laundering\n\nmust be set aside, they are entitled to resentencing.            See United\n\nStates v. Meader, 195 F.3d 66, 68 (1st Cir. 1999) (resentencing\n\nappropriate where the Court \"[could] not say that the trial judge\n\nwould have reached the same sentence within the range\"). Since the\n\ngovernment concedes that the Chapter President Defendants are\n\nentitled to resentencing, we decline to address any of their\n\narguments with respect to their sentences.           Cf. United States v.\n\nPinillos-Pietro,    419   F.3d   61,   74-75   &   n.14   (1st   Cir.   2005)\n\n(declining to reach drug quantity claims given vacatur and remand\n\nof sentences in light of government's concession of Booker error).\n\nWe thus address only the sentencing challenges of the Top Four\n\nDefendants, and do not discuss the merits of the other Defendants'\n\nsentencing challenges.\n\n            1.   Loss Calculation Enhancement\n\n            Some of the Top Four Defendants contend that the district\n\ncourt erred in assessing against each of the defendants an 18-level\n\n\n\n\n                                   -83-\n\fenhancement under the Sentencing Guidelines based on a \"loss\"\n\ncalculation of between $2,500,000 and $7,000,000.\n\n           \"Under the advisory guidelines regime, the district court\n\ncan use the preponderance of the evidence standard to determine\n\nwhether an enhancement applies.\" United States v. Pierre, 484 F.3d\n\n75, 89 (1st Cir. 2007) (quoting United States v. Holliday, 457 F.3d\n\n121, 130 (1st Cir. 2006)).        Accordingly, we review the district\n\ncourt's \"factbound\" determinations for purposes of sentencing for\n\nclear error.    Id. (citing United States v. Ventura, 353 F.3d 84, 89\n\n(1st Cir. 2003)).\n\n           As    background,   the   district     court   applied   U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2B1.1(b)(1) (2005), and applied an 18-level enhancement for each\n\ndefendant under Section 2B1.1(b)(1)(J), since the loss amount the\n\ncourt calculated (approximately $5.5 million, with $1.1 million\n\nadded to Lugo and Román for misapplying additional funds) was\n\nbetween $2.5 million and $7.5 million. Application Note 3(E)(I) to\n\nU.S.S.G.   §    2B1.1(b)(1)    provides     an   offset   for   \"[t]he   money\n\nreturned, and the fair market value of the property returned and\n\nthe services rendered, by the defendant or other persons acting\n\njointly with the defendant, to the victim before the offense was\n\ndetected.\"     We review the district court's determination for clear\n\nerror.\n\n           On appeal, the Top Four Defendants all challenge the\n\ndistrict court's loss calculation on two grounds: (1) none of them\n\n\n                                     -84-\n\fcould have foreseen the amounts that each of the other defendants\n\nwould receive, such that each defendant's loss amount should, at\n\nthe most, be the amount he or she individually received; see United\n\nStates v. Codarcea, 505 F.3d 68, 72 (1st Cir. 2007) (under Section\n\n2B1.1, a conspirator will be held accountable for losses within the\n\nscope of a conspiracy that \"would have been foreseeable by a\n\nreasonable person in [the conspirator's] shoes\"); and (2) the court\n\nshould have credited them for \"services rendered.\"\n\n            The    first    ground         fails.    The     Top   Four    Defendants'\n\nextensive knowledge and control of the embezzlement scheme as a\n\nwhole made the total amount foreseeable.                 As to the second ground,\n\nthe Top Four Defendants premise their argument on the fact that\n\ntheir scheme was detected in 2004, but the evidence shows that the\n\ndate of detection was as early as 2000, when the OIC audited the\n\nHealth Plan.      See U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1 cmt. n.3(E)(I) (defining \"time\n\nof detection\" as \"the earlier of (I) the time of the offense was\n\ndiscovered by a victim or government agency; or (II) the time the\n\ndefendant knew or reasonably should have known that the offense was\n\ndetected    or    about    to   be    detected      by   a   victim   or   government\n\nagency\").   By that time, the evidence showed that the AAA paid $1.2\n\nmillion pursuant to the \"labor license.\"                 Assuming the same amount\n\nfor services rendered to the Plan, it would not lower the total\n\namount   embezzled        below      the    $2.5    million    threshold     for   the\n\nenhancement.      Thus, we find no error.\n\n\n                                            -85-\n\f           2.    Lugo Enhancements\n\n           Lugo separately argues that the court's factual findings\n\nwith   respect    to    his   sentencing    enhancements   for     (1)    using\n\nsophisticated means, (2) deriving more than $1,000,000 from a\n\nfinancial institution, and (3) organizing or leading an extensive\n\ncriminal activity, were clearly erroneous.\n\n           As background, at Lugo's sentencing, the district court\n\nassessed a base offense level of seven, pursuant to U.S.S.G.\n\n§§ 2S1.1(a)(1) & 2B1.1(a)(1), and then the following enhancements:\n\nan 18-level loss enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(1), as\n\nalready   discussed;      a   two-level     enhancement    under     U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2S1.1(b)(2)(B), because Lugo was convicted under 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1956; a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3, because\n\nLugo abused a position of trust; a two-level enhancement under\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(9)(C), because Lugo used \"sophisticated means\"\n\nin committing the offense; a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2B1.1(b)(14)(A), because Lugo derived more than $1,000,000 in\n\ngross receipts from a \"financial institution[ ]\"; and a four-level\n\nenhancement     under   U.S.S.G.    §   3B1.1(a),   because   Lugo       was   an\n\n\"organizer or leader\" of an extensive criminal activity involving\n\nfive or more participants.         Lugo objected to the enhancements for\n\nusing sophisticated means, deriving more than $1,000,000 from a\n\nfinancial institution, and organizing or leading an extensive\n\ncriminal activity.      The district court overruled his objections.\n\n\n                                     -86-\n\f          As Lugo preserved his claims, we review the district\n\ncourt's factual findings supporting these enhancements for clear\n\nerror.\n\n                 a.    sophisticated means\n\n          As to using sophisticated means, Lugo used several Union\n\nAccounts (the Infrastructure Account, the Administrative Account,\n\nand the Welfare Account) to conceal and move millions of dollars.\n\nThe record also shows that Lugo filed fraudulent tax returns and\n\nthat he participated in doctoring minutes of meetings.       These are\n\nsufficient \"sophisticated means\" to support the enhancement.         See\n\nUnited States v. Edelmann, 458 F.3d 791, 816 (8th Cir. 2006)\n\n(affirming where the defendant \"created and used numerous false\n\ndocuments,\" \"including multiple years of federal tax returns,\" fake\n\nloan documents, and misleading bank statements; even assuming the\n\ncomponent parts of the scheme were not complex, \"the total scheme\n\nwas sophisticated\").   The only things that Lugo raises in response\n\nare the same claims that support his sufficiency claims, which we\n\nhave already rejected.\n\n                 b.      $1,000,000   in  gross   receipts    from     a\n                         \"financial institution[]\"\n\n          As to \"deriving more than $1,000,000 from a financial\n\ninstitution,\" Lugo argues that the Plan does not qualify as a\n\n\"financial institution.\"      However, U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1 cmt. n.1\n\ndefines a \"financial institution\" as the following:\n\n\n\n                                 -87-\n\f          \"Financial institution\" includes any . . .\n          union or employee pension fund; any health,\n          medical, or hospital insurance association;\n          . . . and any similar entity, whether or not\n          insured by the federal government. \"Union or\n          employee pension fund\" and \"any health,\n          medical, or hospital insurance association,\"\n          primarily include large pension funds that\n          serve many persons . . . and associations that\n          undertake to provide pension, disability, or\n          other    benefits     (e.g.,     medical    or\n          hospitalization insurance) to large numbers of\n          persons.\n\nThe Health Plan clearly falls within this definition.             We thus\n\nreject Lugo's claim.\n\n                    c.    \"organizer or leader\"\n\n          As   to   his    \"organizer    or   leader\"   enhancement   under\n\nU.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(a), Lugo argues that the district court clearly\n\nerred in imposing the enhancement because, he claims, there was no\n\nevidence that Lugo managed participants.           See United States v.\n\nCali, 87 F.3d 571, 578 (1st Cir. 1996) (noting that, \"[i]n the\n\npast, we have required some 'degree of control or organizational\n\nauthority over others' to support a section 3B1.1(b) adjustment\").\n\nLugo, in particular, argues that the district court clearly erred\n\nwhen it found at sentencing that Lugo \"recruit[ed]\" the other\n\nDefendants to participate in the scheme, as all of the Defendants\n\nwere elected to their positions.        But such a finding is not clearly\n\nerroneous given that the evidence showed his extensive coordination\n\nof the various activities engaged in by the Defendants, such as\n\nfalsifying loan documents, doctoring minutes, and bamboozling the\n\n\n                                   -88-\n\fOIC concerning the administrative services contract.                     Thus, his\n\ncoordination supports a reasonable inference that he recruited the\n\nothers to participate.        In any event, his involvement in all of\n\nthese activities supports the district court's ultimate finding\n\nthat \"[f]rankly, this [crime] would not have happened [but] for the\n\nfact that [Lugo] was there.\"         Finally, Lugo seizes on the district\n\ncourt's    statement   that   \"[t]here       is   no   leader   here,\"    but   the\n\ndistrict court made this statement in response to defense counsel's\n\nstatement that the Defendants \"were elected by the leadership.\"\n\n(Emphasis added).      Read in context, the statement only corrects\n\ndefense counsel's statement.         Accordingly, the district court did\n\nnot err in imposing the enhancement.\n\n            3.   Substantive Reasonableness\n\n            Finally,   Lugo    and    Román       challenge     the   substantive\n\nreasonableness of their sentences under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), citing\n\ntheir old age and poor health.           Lugo separately challenges the\n\ndisparity between his sentence and that of Román.                        Lugo was\n\nsentenced to 210 months and Román to 108 months.\n\n            We review a substantive reasonableness challenge under an\n\n\"abuse-of-discretion standard.\"         Gall v. United States, 128 S. Ct.\n\n586, 594 (2007).       Specifically, we review a within Guidelines\n\nsentence only for whether it represents \"a defensible overall\n\nresult.\"    United States v. Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 518 (1st\n\nCir. 2006) (en banc).\n\n\n                                      -89-\n\f           We conclude that the result here was defensible.           Román\n\nclaims that nine years \"is a very long time\" for someone with his\n\nhealth conditions, but fails to show that he cannot get adequate\n\nmedical care in prison.         Neither does Lugo, who makes the same\n\nargument. Given the severity and sophistication of their offenses,\n\ntheir   sentences    are   appropriate    despite    their   ages.     Lugo\n\nseparately emphasizes the disparity between his sentence (210\n\nmonths) and Román's sentence (108), arguing that their sentences\n\nmust be \"aligned\" because the \"disparit[y] [is] conspicuous and\n\nthreaten[s]   to    undermine    confidence   in    the   criminal   justice\n\nsystem.\"   United States v. Martin, 520 F.3d 87, 94 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\nHowever, we leave such alignment to the discretion of the district\n\ncourt, see id., and the district court did not abuse its discretion\n\nhere, where Lugo's longer sentence is justified by, among other\n\nthings, the fact that he embezzled double the amount of funds as\n\ndid Román.    For all of these reasons, we reject their claims.\n\n                            III.   Conclusion\n\n           For the forgoing reasons, we affirm in part, reverse in\n\npart, and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n           Affirmed in part, Reversed in part, and Remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -90-\n\f",

Dramatis Personae</h2>\n<p>There are eleven appellant-defendants in this consolidated appeal (together, the \"Defendants\"). They are:</p>\n<blockquote>(1) Héctor René Lugo-Ríos (\"Lugo\")</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) Andrés Carrasquillo-Colón (\"Carrasquillo\")</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(3) Elba García-Pastrana (\"García\")</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(4) Felipe Román-Lozada (\"Román\")</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(5) Jesús Caraballo-Ortiz (\"Caraballo\")</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(6) Luis Andino-Delbrey (\"Andino\")</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(7) Francisco Martínez-Irizarry (\"Martínez\")</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(8) Juan Ramos-Hernández (\"Ramos\")</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(9) Enrique Vázquez-Préstamo (\"Vázquez\")</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(10) Jorge L. Urbina-Acevedo (\"Urbina\")</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(11) Juan Roldán-Vega (\"Roldán\")</blockquote>\n<p>The Defendants were non-management, \"regular\" employees of AAA, a public utility company providing water and sewer services to Puerto Rico's residents. Each defendant was also a member of the Union, which represented AAA's non-management employees. Management employees of AAA were members of a different union, called Hermandad Independiente Empleados Profesionales de la AAA (\"HIEPPA\").</p>\n<p>At all times relevant to this appeal, the Union had approximately 4,500 total members, and each member paid $7 per month in membership dues. The Union had other funds. Apart from the health plan contributions at issue in this appeal, the Union also received (1) monthly contributions to \"a temporary disability insurance\" program known as the \"SINOT and Uniform Benefits program\" (hereinafter \"SINOT\");<sup>[1]</sup> (2) monthly contributions to an <span class=\"star-pagination\">*359</span> employee savings and retirement program; and (3) money received by the Union for renting out a parking lot.</p>\n<p>The Union's composition, activities, and finances were governed by two documents: (1) a constitution and (2) a collective bargaining agreement with the AAA.<sup>[2]</sup> The Union's constitution established a Central Executive Committee (\"CEC\") responsible for the Union's finances and day-to-day administration. The CEC consisted of a president, vice president, executive secretary, and treasurer, as well as a single representative from each of the Union's seven local chapters. At all times relevant to this appeal, Lugo, Carrasquillo, García, and Román served as the president, vice president, executive secretary, and treasurer, respectively, of the CEC (together, the \"Top Four Defendants\"). At all times relevant to this appeal, Caraballo, Andino, Martínez, Ramos, Vázquez, Urbina, and Roldán were presidents of the Union's seven local chapters (together, the \"Chapter Presidents\").</p>\n<p>The Union did not provide a salary for CEC officers. Instead, the officers were paid under a labor leave with pay provision in the collective bargaining agreement. Under that \"labor leave\" provision, also referred to as a \"labor license,\" the AAA paid the officers their full salaries, but excused the officers from their AAA jobs to work full time for the Union.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Under the collective-bargaining agreement, the AAA agreed to contribute a fixed amount per month to a \"health insurance plan\" for every Union member.<sup>[4]</sup> At all times relevant to this appeal, the monthly contributions ranged from $232 to $355 per member.</p>\n<p>Until 1993, the Union used the AAA's contributions to administer a health plan called Plan de Salud UIA (the \"Old Health Plan\"). The Old Health Plan was not incorporated as a \"health service organization\" and thus was not subject to the jurisdiction of Puerto Rico's Office of the Insurance Commissioner (the \"OIC\").</p>\n<p>In late 1993, the CEC incorporated the Union-operated plan as a health service organization, Plan de Salud UIA (the \"Health Plan\" or \"Plan\"). Defendants Lugo, Carrasquillo, García, and Román filed paperwork certifying that the Union would administer the AAA's medical contributions \"in compliance with\" and otherwise be subject to \"the Puerto Rico Insurance Code.\" In incorporating the Health Plan, the Union complied with provisions of the collective bargaining agreement that required that \"[t]he Union ... contract the services of a medical plan that is authorized by the [OIC]\" and that \"the medical plan fully compl[y] with all the requirements imposed by the [OIC].\"<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*360</span> The Health Plan's bylaws provided that the Health Plan was a \"non-profit corporation with the fundamental purpose of providing health care services to the employees of [the AAA] who are members of the [Union].\" They further stated that \"[t]he principal source of financing of [the Health Plan] shall be the contributions negotiated by means of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, to be made by the [AAA].\" Under the collective bargaining agreement, the AAA would disburse each monthly Health Plan contribution to the Union via a check in the Union's name.<sup>[6]</sup> Although the funds were not directly sent to the Health Plan, the AAA's monthly checks stated on their face that they were \"health plan contribution[s],\"<sup>[7]</sup> and the collective bargaining agreement further provided that AAA \"agree[d] to contribute <i>to the medical plan</i> the following amounts for each employee.\" (Emphasis added). In addition, the collective bargaining agreement did not specifically provide that the funds belonged to the Union or that the Union could keep any surplus should it contract with a medical plan for less than the AAA contribution amount.</p>\n<p>The Health Plan's bylaws further established a board of directors consisting of eleven members, four of whom would serve on an Executive Committee composed of a president, vice president, executive secretary, and treasurer, with nearly identical duties to their Union counterparts. Like the Union's constitution, the Plan's bylaws did not provide the board members with a salary. As provided by the Puerto Rico Insurance Code, the Plan's board of directors would be \"fiduciarily responsible\" for funds received on behalf of the Plan's subscribers.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>In 1995, after the Health Plan was incorporated, the eleven defendants and four other individuals met at Union headquarters to elect a board for the Health Plan. Lugo, Carrasquillo, García, and Román were chosen for the Executive Committee; they would serve as president, vice president, executive secretary, and treasurer, respectively. The other seven defendants were chosen for the other seven slots; they would serve as Health Plan \"delegates\" for their respective Union chapters. Thus, at the times relevant to this case, all eleven defendants simultaneously served as members of the Union's CEC and as members of the Health Plan's board.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. 1998 to 2001 Conduct</h2>\n<p>The Top Four Defendants controlled two Union bank accounts of significance to this appeal: (1) the Infrastructure Account and (2) the Union Account. The Top Four Defendants, in their capacity as the Plan's executive committee, also controlled the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*361</span> Health Plan's bank account (the \"Plan Account\"), which belonged directly to the Health Plan.</p>\n<p>From 1998 through most of 2001, the evidence showed that, upon receipt of the monthly \"medical plan contributions\" from the AAA, Lugo and Román would generally engage in the following transactions:</p>\n<blockquote>1. Lugo and Román would first deposit all of the AAA's Health Plan contributions directly into the Plan Account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>2. After the first transfer was complete, Lugo and Román would then transfer some of that money from the Plan Account into the Infrastructure Account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>3. They would then transfer some of the money from the Infrastructure Account to the Union Account, which is where the Union's membership dues were deposited.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>4. Finally, they would pay themselves and the other Defendants from both the Infrastructure and Union Accounts, via regular checks subsequently cashed or deposited into each of the Defendant's personal bank accounts.</blockquote>\n<p>In 2000, the OIC, using its broad investigatory authority,<sup>[9]</sup> audited the Health Plan. During the audit of the transfers from the Plan Account to the Infrastructure Account, the OIC discovered that the transfers amounted to six percent of the AAA's monthly contributions, and that the Union was charging the Plan that amount for \"administrative services.\" Because there was no contract or other documentation to support the six-percent payments, the OIC concluded that the Health Plan had violated the Insurance Code, which required a health service organization to file a formal request before delegating administrative functions to another entity.<sup>[10]</sup> Moreover, the OIC requested additional information concerning the breakdown of the \"administrative services\" charged to the Health Plan. Lugo responded in an August 2001 letter that the charge covered such things as \"computer systems,\" \"equipment,\" \"building,\" and \"human resources\" needed to administer and operate the Health Plan. The OIC kept its investigation open.</p>\n<p>During this time, the Health Plan had negative cash flow, such that, by the latter part of 2001, the Health Plan could not cover its expenses. Under the collective bargaining agreement, the AAA agreed to assist the Plan in resolving any \"deficit\" in its finances, subject to an audit, so long as it was not caused by \"illegal appropriation, malfeasance, misuse of funds or negligence.\"<sup>[11]</sup> Upon learning of the Health Plan debt, AAA reviewed records provided by the Health Plan to confirm the impairment, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*362</span> but did not conduct a full third party audit. The records submitted for review did not reflect the payments made to the Defendants, because those payments were made from the Infrastructure and Union Accounts using money transferred out of the Plan Account. Finding no problems in the Health Plan books provided by the Defendants, on September 9, 2001, the AAA provided the Health Plan a check for $2,781,146 payable to the Union. The Defendants deposited the money in the Union Account. In the weeks that followed, the Defendants wrote four separate checks from the Union Account to the Health Plan. The checks totaled around $2.5M, less than the approximately $2.7M paid by the AAA to the Union to cover the Health Plan's impairment.<sup>[12]</sup> The difference remained in the Union Account.</p>\n<p>Throughout the 1998 to 2001 period, the AAA's monthly medical contributions were $232 per Union member. With few exceptions, the Defendants deposited the full $232 into the Health Plan's account prior to reallocating the money into other accounts.<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p>Also during this time, the Defendants personally received a substantial portion of the funds contained in the Infrastructure and Union Accounts as compared to the Union's total income.</p>\n<p></p>\n<pre>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                       Total Income\n            Total         Total           Combined     as Reported\n            Payments      Payments        Total        on Union\n            to            to Defendants   Paid to      Balance Sheet\n            Defendants    from            Defendants   (not including\n            from Union    Infrastructure  from Both    Health Plan\nYear        Account       Account         Accounts     contributions)<sup>[14]</sup>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1998        $319,742      $346,345         $666,087      $746,804\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1999        $405,256      $352,285         $757,541      $690,357\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2000        $348,910      $402,784         $751,694      $835,469\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n</pre>\n<p>In total, from 1998 through 2001 the Defendants received $3 million from the Infrastructure and Union Accounts, with an average of about $70,000 per Defendant per year. The amounts dwarf the amount reported by the Defendants on their annual income tax statement for those years, ranging from $25,609 (Urbina, 1999) to $46,048 (García, 2001). Moreover, despite receiving these payments, the Defendants <span class=\"star-pagination\">*363</span> were not listed on the Health Plan's payroll or the Plan's tax returns.</p>\n<p>Throughout this time period, García, in her role as executive secretary, certified to the OIC that all of the members of the Health Plan's board, which consisted of the eleven Defendants, fully discussed the full gamut of the Plan's business on a frequent basis.<sup>[15]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. 2002 to 2003 Conduct</h2>\n<p>The landscape altered dramatically in the beginning of 2002.</p>\n<p>In early 2002, the OIC continued its investigation into the \"administrative services\" the Defendants charged the Health Plan. In January 2002, Lugo sent the OIC a letter attaching what he claimed was the \"contract\" under which the Defendants provided such administrative services for the Health Plan. The contract had only been signed a week earlier by Lugo and José Sánchez Gastaltierri (\"Sánchez\"), the Health Plan's administrator. Sánchez would later testify at trial that García had given him the contract to sign, and he had signed it that same day or the day afterward without analyzing it. He further testified that he only signed it because he \"understood that to be a requirement\" of his job as a \"consultant\" to Lugo and the Health Plan.</p>\n<p>Still in early 2002, a \"me-too\" clause in the collective bargaining agreement required AAA to contribute the same amount of funds for health care for Union members as for members of HIEPPA. Accordingly, beginning in February 2002, the AAA began to contribute $355 monthly to the Health Plan for each Union member.</p>\n<p>Also beginning in February 2002, the Defendants opened a new banking account, known as the Welfare Account, which did not appear in either the Union's or the Health Plan's records.<sup>[16]</sup> The opening of the Welfare Account came hot on the heels of a Report of Examination issued by the OIC on December 17, 2001, which found that the Health Plan violated the Insurance Code<sup>[17]</sup> by charging the AAA a higher rate than was approved by the OIC.<sup>[18]</sup> In fact, the Health Plan had not sought approval for its rate since 1994, when the OIC approved a rate of $222 per subscriber.</p>\n<p>Thus, purportedly to avoid any fines for charging unapproved rates,<sup>[19]</sup> the Defendants <span class=\"star-pagination\">*364</span> went against their prior practice and began to deposit the full $355 per member contribution into the Welfare Account, and later would transfer a substantial portion of the contribution into the Health Plan. The remaining amount would be transferred through different Union-controlled accounts to pay the Defendants and to finance Union activities. In 2002, the AAA's $355 monthly contributions per member totaled more than $20.3 million. However, only $16.3 million of that amount ultimately reached the Health Plan.</p>\n<p>The Health Plan subsequently faced another impairment. This time, the Defendants decided that, to cover the debt, the Health Plan would seek a series of loans from the Union, which would require the Plan to obtain OIC approval of the loans. The Plan sent the OIC the requisite paperwork, which was certified by García and Román. Luciano testified that, at the time the loans were made, he \"did not believe that the [U]nion had that kind of money to lend ... out,\" given how minimal its income was in comparison with the Plan's. He further testified that when he aired his concerns, he was later fired, he believed in part because of these \"differences.\" The OIC ultimately approved the loans based on the Defendants' representations.</p>\n<p>The Union made four loans to the Health Plan in 2002 and 2003, totaling about $3.9 million. The Defendants disbursed each of the four loan checks from the Union Account into the Plan Account. However, shortly after writing each loan check the Defendants would write another check in the same amount from the Welfare Account to the Union Account, sometimes on the same day (as shown below):</p>\n<p></p>\n<pre>\n4/16/02     Union Account     →    Health Plan      $  600,057\n4/30/02     Welfare Account        Union Account    $  600,057\n4/9/03      Union Account     →    Health Plan      $1,790,000\n4/9/03      Welfare Account        Union Account    $1,790,000\n8/21/03     Union Account     →    Health Plan      $  183,245\n8/21/03     Welfare Account        Union Account    $  183,245\n9/11/03     Union Account     →    Health Plan      $1,391,630\n9/11/03     Welfare Account        Union Account    $1,391,630\n</pre>\n<p>Because the Welfare Account was funded with money intended for the Health Plan, essentially the Union was loaning the Health Plan its <i>own</i> funds. The OIC would later discover that the Health Plan was loaning itself its own money and order the loans annulled.</p>\n<p>In 2003, the Defendants opened yet another Union bank account, the Administration Account. They deposited into that account the remaining funds from the Old Health Plan, funds that had never been transferred to the new Plan when it was first incorporated. As with the Infrastructure and Union Accounts, the Defendants also diverted funds to themselves from the Administration Account.</p>\n<p>Throughout the course of 2002 and 2003, the Defendants, particularly Lugo, Carasquillo, and García, remained in contact with the OIC concerning the purported administrative services contract. Aurea López, the OIC's chief investigator, testified at length concerning irregularities in the contract, including but not limited to: (1) the Health Plan, rather than seek approval from the OIC before delegating functions to the Union, submitted an already-executed contract; (2) the contract lacked any specificity; (3) the Defendants' responses to OIC questions concerning what the contract covered were vague; (3) Lugo's attempt to clarify the contract in one instance actually added terms (such as property damage insurance) that were not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*365</span> in the contract; (4) the Union was overcharging the Plan, paying more than $2.2 million more than fair market value for the services the Union provided; (5) neither the Union nor the Plan passed a corporate resolution authorizing the contract; and (6) the contract stated that Sánchez had \"complete authority\" to sign it on the Plan's behalf, when there was no evidence that he had such authority.</p>\n<p>From 2002 through 2003, the Defendants paid themselves a total of more than $1,700,000 from the Infrastructure, Union, and Administration Accounts. Again, none of the Defendants reported this income in their tax returns, despite the fact that the income overwhelmed the amount of money they actually reported. Moreover, the Health Plan's tax returns, which again Lugo signed, did not list the Defendants on the payroll. Finally, from 2002 through 2003, the Defendants were purportedly meeting regularly \"every day,\" eating lunch together in the Union's cafeteria (and charging the meals to the Infrastructure Account to boot).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. 2004 to 2006 Conduct</h2>\n<p>In January 2004, the OIC formally rejected the purported administrative services contract that had been submitted by the Union, concluding that it \"substantially affect[ed] the financial situation\" of the Health Plan. The OIC cited contractual irregularities and lack of control it allowed the Health Plan over its <i>own</i> finances as reasons for disallowing the arrangement. The OIC also requested information from Carrasquillo about the Infrastructure and Union Accounts, such as who was paid from them, how much, and for what services. Carrasquillo was less than forthcoming. He responded that the Defendants were paid from the Infrastructure Account for spending \"50 to 60 percent of the[ir] time\" on Health Plan matters, and that he could provide further details but the books were behind. As for the Union Account, Carrasquillo stated that any inquiry into it was \"not appropriate\" and \"unrelated\" to the Health Plan. Despite the OIC's rejection of the contract, the Defendants continued to transfer the Plan's funds as though the contract was still in effect.<sup>[20]</sup></p>\n<p>In May 2004, the OIC made public much of what it had learned about the Health Plan during its investigation. The Defendants were subsequently ordered to transfer the $7.4M that remained in the Welfare Account to the Health Plan. After learning of the OIC's findings, the AAA stopped making monthly contributions to the Union for Health Plan purposes, and instead began to deposit contribution payments directly into the Plan Account. In August 2004, the AAA stopped contributing to the Health Plan entirely. It also ceased paying the Defendants under the labor leave provisions of the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p>Shortly thereafter, in September 2004, all eleven Defendants filed amended tax returns for every year from 1998 through 2003, reporting purported \"income\" that they had not reported earlier. In a creative stroke, the Defendants listed the previously unreported income as \"payments received for professions and commissions\" without listing what those \"professions\" or \"commissions\" were.</p>\n<p>In October 2004, the Union began a twelve week strike. While on strike, the Union members, including the Defendants, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*366</span> were not entitled to any salary or benefits from the AAA. Instead, the Union itself would pay each member $300 every two weeks for participating in strike activities, for a maximum of up to $1,800. During the strike, however, all of the Defendants received payments from the Infrastructure and Union Accounts. Many of these payments were treated as reimbursement expenses although the Defendants had no supporting documentation.</p>\n<p>Including these final payments during the strike, the Defendants received a total of more than $5.8M from the Infrastructure, Union, and Administration Accounts from 1998 through 2004. The individual Defendants' totals were as follows:</p>\n<p></p>\n<pre>\nLugo                   $1,757,164\nCarrasquillo           $  948,166\nGarcía                $  540,127<sup>[21]</sup>\nRomán                 $  868,421\nCaraballo              $  287,204\nAndino                 $  282,086\nMartínez              $  247,897\nRamos                  $  234,714\nVázquez               $  247,075\nUrbina                 $  194,729\nRoldán                $  203,827\n</pre>\n<p>In late October 2004, federal agents executed a search warrant at the Union's headquarters, which also housed the Health Plan's offices. Agents seized from Lugo's office nearly $40,000 in cash, along with ten uncashed checks from the Infrastructure Account and incomplete Health Plan board meeting minutes.</p>\n<p>In 2005, a grand jury issued a subpoena to the Health Plan's custodian of records, seeking the complete minute book for the Plan's board meetings. García, the Health Plan's custodian, declined to produce the book, claiming that it was seized during the search. In early 2006, just months before trial, García gave the minute book to her successor as the Health Plan's executive secretary, Enrique Dávila Vargas (\"Dávila\"), which later was obtained by the government during trial. The book contained additional meeting minutes that were not included in the documents seized by the government.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. The Proceedings</h2>\n<p>The Defendants were charged in a 140-count indictment.<sup>[22]</sup> Count 1 charged all Defendants with a conspiracy to violate 18 U.S.C. § 669, which prohibits the embezzlement or misapplication of funds of a \"health care benefit program.\" Counts 2 through 132 each charged an individual Defendant with receipt of a check from a Union bank account (<i>e.g.,</i> the Infrastructure Account, the Union Account) that the government alleged constituted substantive embezzlement of Health Plan funds in violation of § 669.<sup>[23]</sup> Counts 133-39 charged Román and Lugo jointly with misapplication of funds in violation 18 U.S.C. § 669, specifically funds concerning the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*367</span> Old Health Plan.<sup>[24]</sup> Finally, Count 140 charged all of the Defendants with a conspiracy to commit money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(A)(i), § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i), &amp; § 1956(h).</p>\n<p>The case proceeded to trial, which commenced on May 2, 2006. At trial, a number of witnesses testified for the government: Nieves; López; Luciano; Sánchez; Cornier; Dávila; Jennifer Griffen, an FBI financial analyst who was involved in the October 2004 search and who testified to the payments to the Defendants from the Union, Infrastructure, and Administrative Accounts; Clotilde Díaz (\"Díaz\"), who ran the Union cafeteria; and Gerald LaPorte, an expert on ink analysis of documents. The Defendants countered with, among other things, the testimony of Lemuel Toledo (\"Toledo\"), a certified insurance counselor who testified as to the reasonableness of the rate charged under the administrative services contract and Manuel Villalón, a tax attorney and CPA who advised the Defendants.</p>\n<p>Of significance to this appeal, the government gave the minute book it obtained from Dávila to LaPorte to be examined. At trial, LaPorte testified that the minutes dating from 1995-2003, including all meetings relating to the Health Plan loans, were likely not authored on the dates presented. In fact, he testified that the evidence \"strongly support[ed]\" the conclusion that the minutes in question, including the loan minutes, were all created at the same time, rather than over the course of eight years.</p>\n<p>In June 2006, following a seven-week jury trial, all of the Defendants except Carrasquillo were convicted of all charges they faced. In September 2006, following a separate three-week jury trial, Carrasquillo, who was tried separately due to illness, was likewise convicted of all charges that pertained to him. In December 2006 and February 2007, the Defendants were sentenced, with the respective sentences ranging from twelve months and a day (Caraballo, Andino, and Urbina) to 210 months (Lugo).</p>\n<p>The Defendants now appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Sufficiency of Evidence</h2>\n<p>The Defendants raise a number of issues concerning the sufficiency of the evidence in support of their convictions. \"We review a sufficiency claim de novo, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict to determine whether a rational jury could find each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>United States v. Scott,</i> 564 F.3d 34, 39 (1st Cir.2009) (citing <i>United States v. DeCologero,</i> 530 F.3d 36, 65 (1st Cir.2008)). In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, \"[w]e do not `weigh evidence or make credibility judgments.'\" <i>United States v. Bristol-Mártir,</i> 570 F.3d 29, 38 (1st Cir. 2009) (quoting <i>United States v. Ofray-Campos,</i> 534 F.3d 1, 31 (1st Cir.2008)). Moreover, we \"`must uphold any verdict that is supported by a plausible rendition of the record.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 38 (quoting <i>Ofray-Campos,</i> 534 F.3d at 32).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>The Embezzlement Convictions</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The Defendants contend that the evidence is insufficient to support their convictions for embezzlement. Each was convicted under Count I of conspiring to embezzle Health Plan funds pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 669 and 18 U.S.C. § 371. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*368</span> The Defendants were also convicted of separate counts of substantive embezzlement under § 669 based on payments they received from either the Union, Infrastructure, or Administrative Accounts.</p>\n<p>18 U.S.C. § 669, the basis of the embezzlement convictions, provides:</p>\n<blockquote>Whoever knowingly and willfully embezzles, steals, or otherwise without authority converts to the use of any person other than the rightful owner, or intentionally misapplies any of the moneys, funds, securities, premiums, credits, property, or other assets of a health care benefit program, shall be fined ... or imprisoned ... or both ....</blockquote>\n<p>18 U.S.C. § 669(a). Section 669 \"remains largely untested and unanalyzed.\" Robert Fabrikant et al., Health Care Fraud § 2.02[5], at 2-34 (2009).<sup>[25]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. \"funds ... of a health care benefit program\"</h2>\n<p>The Defendants first contend that there is insufficient evidence to establish that the transactions at issue in support of Counts 2 through 139 involved \"funds ... of a health care benefit program.\"<sup>[26]</sup> 18 U.S.C. § 669. They argue that, because the Defendants commingled Health Plan funds with other funds within the custody of the Union, there is insufficient evidence to establish that the Defendants embezzled Health Plan funds as opposed to other Union funds.</p>\n<p>A first reason for rejecting this contention is that the defendants effectively admitted in their testimony and their arguments to the jury that the moneys they took were essentially payments to them by the Health Plan for services they rendered to it. It was the Defendants' position throughout trial that as officials of the Health Plan, they rendered numerous administrative and executive services to it for which they were entitled to compensation, and that moneys which are the basis of the allegations of the embezzlement were not embezzled at all but were rather taken by them as the Health Plan's proper compensation to them for the services they rendered. Their contention that there was insufficient evidence to prove that the funds were Health Plan moneys is contradicted by their own assertions that these were Health Plan moneys.</p>\n<p>Even without these admissions, we would reject the Defendants' contention. As a threshold matter, the parties dispute what § 669 requires the government to show in order to prove that the purportedly embezzled funds were \"funds ... of a health care benefit plan.\"<sup>[27]</sup> The language <span class=\"star-pagination\">*369</span> of the statute does not provide any guidance, and the few cases that have concerned convictions under § 669 have not addressed the government's burden in proving that embezzled funds are \"funds... of a health care benefit program.\" <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Whited,</i> 311 F.3d 259 (3d Cir.2002) (addressing sufficiency of the indictment, meaning of \"health care benefit program,\" and Commerce Clause challenges to § 669); <i>United States v. Jackson,</i> 524 F.3d 532, 534 (4th Cir. 2008), <i>vacated on other grounds,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 1307, 173 L.Ed.2d 575 (2009) (mentioning, without discussing, conviction under § 669).</p>\n<p>The Defendants point out that, in enacting § 669, Congress did not adopt the approach of other federal statutes that relieve the government of proving the character of the funds embezzled. By way of contrast, the Defendants cite 18 U.S.C. § 666, which prohibits the \"embezzle[ment]\" of funds \"owned by, or ... under the care, custody, or control of [an] organization, government, or agency,\" so long as the organization received \"in any one year period, benefits in excess of $10,000 under a Federal program.\" 18 U.S.C. § 666(a) &amp; (b). By its terms, § 666 does not require the government to prove that the funds purportedly embezzled are, in fact, those funds provided by the \"Federal program\" as opposed to other funds. In fact, the legislative history of § 666 shows that it was enacted precisely to deal with the difficulty of proving the \"federal character\" of funds under the general federal fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. § 641.<sup>[28]</sup><i>See</i> S.Rep. No. 98-225, at 369 (1985), <i>reprinted in</i> 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3510 (noting that § 641 required the government to show \"that the property stolen is property of the United States,\" which was \"impossible\" in many cases where \"the funds are so commingled that the federal character of the funds [could] not be shown\").</p>\n<p>By contrast, the Defendants argue that § 669 provides no such language. In fact, in enacting § 669 as part of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, (\"HIPAA\"), <i>see</i> Pub.L. No. 104-191, 110 Stat. 1936 (1996),<sup>[29]</sup> Congress had the opportunity to adopt the approach taken by § 666 but chose not to. Instead, and as the government concedes, § 669 was most likely \"modeled after\" § 641. <i>See</i> Fabrikant et al., <i>supra,</i> § 3.02[13], at 3-114 to 3-115 (2007) (noting that § 669 was \"modeled after 18 U.S.C. Section 641, which makes it a crime to embezzle, steal, or convert property or a thing of value belonging to the United States\"); <i>see also</i> Diana Douglas, <i>Attorneys Caught in the Web of Medicare/Medicaid Fraud,</i> 21 J. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*370</span> Legal. Med. 395, 412 (2000) (\"Section 669 was patterned after 18 U.S.C. section 641, the federal theft and embezzlement statute, and serves as a companion to it.\").<sup>[30]</sup> Indeed, although not mirror images of each other, both set forth the character of the funds as an element of the offense.</p>\n<p>We agree with the Defendants' premise that § 641 provides the closest analogue to § 669. However, we disagree with the Defendants' conclusion that embezzled dollars cannot serve as the basis of a conviction under § 669 unless they are proven to have been the property of a health plan.</p>\n<p>Like § 669, the case law interpreting § 641 is sparse, but courts have generally not required the government to trace the dollars embezzled to a federal source. In <i>United States v. Gibbs,</i> for example, the Ninth Circuit addressed a sufficiency challenge to a § 641 conviction in the context of commingled sources of funding. 704 F.2d 464 (9th Cir.1983) (per curiam). There, the defendant founded a corporation to \"promote educational opportunities for American Indians\" that \"received most of its funds from the federal government.\" <i>Id.</i> at 465. The defendant was convicted under § 641 despite the fact that the defendant \"commingled federal funds with nonfederal funds received from state and private sources.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The Ninth Circuit upheld the conviction, which involved multiple counts of substantive embezzlement where \"the amount of nonfederal funds exceeded the amounts embezzled, [such that] it is possible that the funds embezzled were entirely nonfederal.\" <i>Id.</i> at 465-66 (noting that the defendant was charged \"with thirty-four counts of embezzlement under 18 U.S.C. § 641\" and that the \"jury convicted him of twenty of the counts.\"). In doing so, the court rejected the defendant's argument that the government failed to prove \"the federal nature of the funds embezzled.\" <i>Id.</i> at 465. The court held, in particular, that the evidence was sufficient because (1) \"between 80-86% of the funds in the account from which [the defendant] embezzled was federal money\" and (2) \"the federal government monitored and controlled these funds.\" <i>Id.</i> at 466. A number of other courts have adopted the same approach. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Evans,</i> 572 F.2d 455, 474 (5th Cir.1978) (holding that the evidence sufficient to support a conviction under § 641 where more than 75 percent of the funds in the commingled account were federal and were \"subject to extensive federal controls\"); <i>United States v. Scott,</i> 784 F.2d 787, 790-91 (7th Cir. 1986) (per curiam) (holding evidence was sufficient to support verdict under § 641 where 98% percent of the commingled funds were federal and \"the federal government still maintained supervision and control over the funds at the point when the funds were stolen.\").</p>\n<p>Our case law is not to the contrary. Defendants cite <i>United States v. Elías-Rivera,</i> where we noted that, in the bankruptcy context, there \"is an established presumption that withdrawals for other than trust purposes from an account in which trust funds are commingled with nontrust funds are presumed to be made from nontrust funds.\" 848 F.2d 16, 19 (1st Cir.1998). But in that case, involving a bankruptcy trustee who commingled all of the estates he supervised in one account, \"[t]he prosecution failed to prove that funds were even missing, much less missing from funds belonging to the debtors,\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*371</span> such that there was a \"total lack of evidence\" to \"rebut [the] presumption.\" <i>Id. Elías-Rivera,</i> therefore, does not speak to the situation here, which concerns what evidence is sufficient to rebut any such presumption.</p>\n<p>Comparing this case to <i>Gibbs</i> and <i>Evans,</i> it is clear that the funds embezzled were \"funds ... of a health care benefit program\" under § 669. As in those cases, (1) the \"health care benefit program\" funds were a substantial portion of the commingled funds; and (2) the \"health care benefit program\" exercised sufficient supervision and control over the funds to preserve their character.</p>\n<p>As the <i>Gibbs</i> court emphasized, \"the government's supervision and control ... is the critical factor in determining the federal character of the funds in a commingled account.\" 704 F.2d at 466. We conclude that, based on the evidence in this case, the Health Plan had sufficient supervision and control over the Health Plan contributions to establish that the funds embezzled were \"funds ... of a health care benefit program.\"</p>\n<p>As an initial matter, the Defendants argue that the relevant analogue to \"federal supervision and control\" in the § 669 context is control by the AAA. But AAA is only the <i>contributor</i> of the funds. Section 669 protects \"funds ... of a health care benefit plan,\" and thus, as in the context of § 641, the relevant entity for purposes of the \"supervision and control\" prong is the <i>protected</i> entity. Moreover, as in <i>Gibbs</i> and <i>Evans,</i> the Health Plan was both the source of the funds and the protected entity. Once the Union deposited the funds in the Plan Account, the Health Plan stood in the same position as the federal government in both providing its funds to the Union and in being the victim of the Defendants' embezzlement.</p>\n<p>The Defendants further argue that the Health Plan did not have a sufficient stake in the funds such that the funds failed to retain their \"Health Plan\" character once they were diverted out of the Health Plan Account. In <i>Evans,</i> for example, the court noted that funds in that case \"ha[d] a federal origin and a federal end, and during their outstanding circulation they [were] subject to extensive federal controls. This [was] not the situation in which the federal monies [were] intended <i>as an outright grant.</i>\" 572 F.2d at 474 (emphasis added). In particular, the <i>Evans</i> court noted that the federal government (in that case the Office of Education) had a sufficient stake in the funds it provided for a federal program; \"The federal interest ... is specifically established and preserved by the provision for termination of the program on a date certain and the requirement that the proportionate share of the balance in the special fund <i>be returned to the government.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> at 472; <i>see also id.</i> at 474 (\"It is statutorily contemplated that the ultimate repayment will be to the federal government.\").</p>\n<p>The Defendants specifically argue that, unlike in <i>Evans,</i> the AAA did not have a right to recover any excess funds. But again the correct analogue is the Health Plan, not the AAA, and the funds diverted were not meant to be, even by the Defendants' own admission, \"outright grants.\" Rather, the Defendants contend that the funds embezzled were for administrative services rendered, and certainly the Health Plan had a sufficient stake in those funds to ensure that the Plan received fair value for those services. The Defendants further argue that the collective bargaining agreement did not bar the Union from preserving any excess funds from the Health Plan. Even if that is true (which is doubtful), there were no excess funds to claim. The Health Plan throughout the time period of the embezzlement scheme <span class=\"star-pagination\">*372</span> suffered significant impairments, such that there were no excess funds that the Union could claim as its own. Thus, as in <i>Evans,</i> the Health Plan had a right to all funds diverted by the Defendants.</p>\n<p>The Defendants finally argue that, unlike in <i>Gibbs</i> and <i>Evans,</i> there was no equivalent to \"federal regulation\" that mandated oversight. But there was. As required under Puerto Rico law, the Defendants were fiduciarily responsible to the Plan and, thus, required to maintain oversight on how the funds were used. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 1907 (\"Fiduciary liability[:] Any director, officer or member of a health service[ ] organization who receives, collects, disburses or invests funds related to the activities of said organization, shall be fiducially liable for the funds received from the subscribers.\"); <i>cf. </i><i>FDIC v. Sea Pines Co.,</i> 692 F.2d 973, 977 (4th Cir.1982) (noting that interlocking directors of two boards have a fiduciary responsibility for assets of both companies). For all of the above reasons, we conclude that the Health Plan exercised supervision and control of the funds, such that they were, in fact, Health Plan funds.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the Health Plan funds were a substantial portion of the commingled funds that the Defendants embezzled. As an initial matter, the Defendants argue that the Health Plan contributions made by AAA did not become \"funds ... of a health care benefit program\" until they were actually <i>deposited</i> in the Plan Account. They point to a concession made by the government in its brief in <i>United States v. Jackson</i><i>,</i> S.Ct. No. 08-263, where the government conceded that employer contributions to an ERISA plan \"themselves are not assets of [a] plan until the contributions are paid to the plan.\" U.S. Br. at 10 (Jan. 16, 2009); <i>see also </i><i>Jackson,</i> 524 F.3d at 543 (holding that \"unpaid employer contributions to the Company and Union Plans constituted `assets' of the Plans under 18 U.S.C. § 664,\" the ERISA theft statute).</p>\n<p>The concession, to the extent that it is relevant to this case,<sup>[31]</sup> does not assist the Defendants. With respect to the convictions occurring from 1998 to 2001, the evidence conclusively demonstrated that, save for one instance, the Union transferred the entire monthly Health Plan contributions to the Plan Account. Thus, there was no question that the funds subsequently diverted were Health Plan funds. Moreover, although, beginning in 2002, the Defendants first deposited the Health Plan in the Welfare Account, a substantial amount of the funds were then deposited into the Plan Account, such that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*373</span> any subsequent diversion of the funds from that Account were Health Plan funds.</p>\n<p>Turning to the evidence, it conclusively demonstrated that the Health Plan contributions, in the language from one defendant's brief, \"were the largest regular deposits by far.\" Based upon the balance sheets provided by the Union, for the years 1998 through 2000, the Union averaged approximately $757,543 per year in income, which translates to a monthly gross income of roughly $63,000 per month. In contrast, during that same time period, and with a contribution rate of $232 per member, the AAA contributed well over <i>$1 million</i> per month in Health Plan contributions during that time period. This percentage alone is well above the 75 to 80 percent threshold established in § 641 cases.<sup>[32]</sup> Holding the average income of the Union constant, the disparity between the Union's average monthly income as compared to the Health Plan contributions was even greater from 2002 to 2004. During this time period, the rate increased dramatically, such that the Union was receiving between $1.5 million and $2.3 million in Health Plan contributions per month from 2002 to 2004.</p>\n<p>The Defendants counter by arguing that the balance sheets failed to include SINOT, retirement, and rental income, which were also commingled with Health Plan funds.<sup>[33]</sup> However, their resort to these additional funds is unavailing. Including these amounts, the evidence showed that the Union contributed approximately $151,041 per month for SINOT and approximately $78,000 per month for the retirement program, and $4,500 per month in income from renting out a parking lot. Combined with the Union's income in dues (as reflected in the average income above), the total amount of non-Health Plan contribution income averaged approximately $300,000 per month. This, again, is only a small percentage of the millions per month the Union was receiving in Health Plan contributions, with the Health Plan contributions representing approximately 77% ($1 million out of $1.3 million total) of the total amount of commingled funds based on the lowest Health Plan contribution.</p>\n<p>The Defendants further counter by focusing on the specific <i>accounts</i> from which the Defendants paid themselves. Although, as a whole, the funds that the Union received in Health Plan contributions far outweighed the funds that the Union received from other sources, the Defendants argue that the amount of Health Plan contributions contained in the accounts vis-a-vis other funds were not proportionally high enough to support the convictions.</p>\n<p>For example, the Defendants point to the testimony of Jennifer Griffin, who did a \"deposit source\" analysis of the funds contained in the Infrastructure Account, as shown in the table below:</p>\n    1998: 69% Health Plan\n          22% SINOT\n           9% Cultural Trips Account\n    1999: 74% Health Plan\n          18% SINOT\n           8% Cultural Trips Account\n    2000: 75% Health Plan\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*374</span>\n          16% SINOT\n           5% Cultural Trips Account\n           4% Union Account\n    2001: 47% Health Plan\n          27% SINOT\n          15% Union Account\n          11% Cultural Trips Account\n    2002: 45% Union Account\n          36% Health Plan\n          16% SINOT\n           3% Cultural Trips Account\n    2003: 72% Union Account\n          15% SINOT\n           8% Cultural Trips Account\n           5% Health Plan\n    2004: 57% Investment Redemptions\n          32% Union Account\n           8% Health Plan\n           3% Welfare Account\n<p>Although for the first three years of the scheme 69 percent (1998), 74 percent (1999), and 75 percent (2000) of the funds contained in the Infrastructure Account were derived from Health Plan funds, the amounts declined in 2001 to 47 percent, and further declined to 36 percent (2002), 5 percent (2003), and 8 percent (2004). The Defendants seize on this decline to argue that, on average, the percentage of Health Plan funds contained in the Infrastructure Account was approximately 44 percent, below the 75 to 80 percent threshold articulated in some § 641 cases.</p>\n<p>The government counters that the \"deposit source\" analysis is somewhat misleading. It notes that, even in those years where the Infrastructure Account contained a small percentage of funds <i>directly</i> diverted from the Health Plan, it still received a significant percentage of funds from the Union Account, which itself contained funds from the Health Plan. In 2003, for example, and as shown by the complicated flow charts prepared by Griffin for trial, $19.4 million of the AAA's Health Plan contributions were deposited into the Union Account. From there, $14.8 million was passed into the Plan Account (via the Welfare Account), with $4.1 million remaining in the Union Account. And then from there, an additional $873,000 was transferred from the Plan Account to the Union Account, which resulted in the Union Account containing well over $5 million of the Health Plan's funds. This exceeded by several million dollars any other sources of funds contained in the Union Account. Thus, the large percentage (72 percent) of Union Account funds contained in the Infrastructure Account itself contained a large percentage of Health Plan funds, such that, combined with the 8 percent of Health Plan funds already contained in the Infrastructure Account, Health Plan funds comprised a substantial portion of the funds in the Infrastructure Account. However, the government did not establish at trial the \"true\" total percentage of Health Plan funds contained in the Infrastructure Account.</p>\n<p>As the above evidence shows, and in contrast to <i>Gibbs,</i> this case involves <i>multiple</i> accounts with commingled funds, with those accounts funneling Health Plan funds into each other. This scenario presents further opportunities for abuse.<sup>[34]</sup> However, based on our review of the specific evidence in this case, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict, we conclude that, as in <i>Gibbs</i> and <i>Evans,</i> Health Plan funds were a substantial portion <span class=\"star-pagination\">*375</span> of the funds in the commingled accounts.</p>\n<p>First, we stress again that the disparity between the Health Plan contributions as compared to the Union's other sources of funds was staggering. The Union received in the realm of 70 to 80 percent of its funds from Health Plan contributions, as compared to all other sources (including funds, such as SINOT and the funds for the retirement program, that the Union was not permitted to use as income). Moreover, and as the evidence showed, the Health Plan funds were commingled <i>among</i> the accounts from which the Defendants paid themselves, such that a rational juror could conclude that, at any given time, the Accounts contained Health Plan funds. That alone is sufficient under <i>Gibbs</i> to establish the \"substantial portion\" prong.</p>\n<p>Second, we note that the 75 to 80 percent level discussed in <i>Gibbs</i> and <i>Evans</i> is not a threshold. Indeed, the Seventh Circuit upheld a conviction under § 641 where as little as 50 percent of the commingled funds were federal. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Mitchell,</i> 625 F.2d 158, 161 (7th Cir. 1980) (concerning theft of check from Aid to Families with Dependent Children account containing 50 percent federal funds). Thus, almost all of the years for the Infrastructure Account contained a sufficient portion of Health Plan funds. For all of these reasons, we conclude that, as in <i>Gibbs</i> and <i>Evans,</i> the evidence is sufficient to show that the Health Plan funds were a substantial portion of the funds embezzled from the commingled sources.</p>\n<p>Based on the above, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient in this case to permit a rational jury to convict the Defendants for each of the substantive embezzlement counts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. \"without authority\"</h2>\n<p>Defendants next contend that there was insufficient evidence to prove that they were \"without authority\" to receive the Health Plan funds. The Defendants argue that they were <i>entitled</i> to additional compensation for the work they performed on behalf of the Health Plan, and that this compensation was authorized by the collective bargaining agreement, the constitution, the Plan bylaws, and \"historical practice.\"</p>\n<p>We conclude that the evidence was sufficient in this case to establish that the Defendants acted \"without authority.\" We stress at the outset that the issue is not whether the Defendants were anywhere explicitly <i>prohibited</i> from receiving payments from the Health Plan for services rendered; rather, the issue is whether they lacked the authority to do so. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Hammond,</i> 201 F.3d 346, 349 (5th Cir.1999) (per curiam) (although union president did not \"break any law or union rule\" in spending political funds, court affirmed conviction because a \"rational juror\" could conclude that expenditure was unauthorized). And, in this case, the Defendants lacked such authority.</p>\n<p>The Defendants first point to the purported \"administrative services\" contract they provided to OIC, but that is a nonstarter. The evidence at trial showed that the contract was replete with irregularities, overcharged for services, was created after the fact, was ultimately rejected by the OIC, and the government provided evidence that the minutes supporting the contract were forged. The Defendants claimed that the OIC \"mistakenly\" rejected the contract \"on the assumption that [the Defendants] could not receive such compensation because they were paid labor license.\" Even if true (which it is not, as detailed in the OIC rejection letter), the contract was nonetheless rejected, and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*376</span> cannot authorize the Defendants' actions in this case.</p>\n<p>The Defendants further point to a number of provisions in the Health Plan bylaws, the constitution, and the collective bargaining agreement that would permit compensation or at least not prohibit it. For example:</p>\n<blockquote>* The Health Plan bylaws establish the authority of the board of directors to \"set[] salaries of officials\";</blockquote>\n<blockquote>* The constitution states that \"the [CEC] will fix the representative expenses and the bonuses of the Union's Officers\";</blockquote>\n<blockquote>* The collective bargaining agreement puts Lugo in charge of \"managing and directing the rendering of services.\"</blockquote>\n<p>These provisions, if exercised, may have provided authority for the Defendants' compensation. But there was no evidence, such as a formal resolution, meeting minutes, or any other documentation that showed that the Defendants exercised those provisions. Thus, these provisions cannot supply the necessary authority for their actions.</p>\n<p>The Defendant next argue that, as a matter of practice, they received compensation for the services they provided for the Health Plan. They point to the testimony of Rubén Luciano, who testified that, under the Old Health Plan, \"there was always compensation paid to the Board of Directors.\" But this purported historical practice lacks any formal resolution or other authorization. Moreover, unlike the Old Health Plan, the Health Plan was subject to Puerto Rico's Insurance Code, and under the Code the Health Plan was required to seek approval from the OIC, and to \"furnish to the Commissioner the adequate information to justify the\" delegation of administrative services to the Defendants. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 1905(2)(a). The evidence showed that the Defendants failed to do so in this case, and thus they cannot resort to their historical practice as a source of authority.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Defendants challenge testimony given by Aurea López, the OIC's chief investigator into the Union's scheme, concerning the Defendants' labor license.<sup>[35]</sup> At trial, López testified to the following:</p>\n<blockquote>The reason for excluding those enjoying Union leave is that the position held by the Commissioner of Insurance is that those persons were already being compensated by AAA so that they could offer services to the Union. So we understood that it was also not correct that the [Health Plan] be charged for services that these people rendered to the [Health Plan].</blockquote>\n<p>The Defendants claim that López provided unqualified opinion testimony to the effect that the labor license prohibited the Defendants from receiving additional compensation for their work on the Health Plan. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 702 (permitting opinion testimony if \"(1) the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case\"). The Defendants point out that López was not established as an expert on the Union's activities to opine on the labor license. The government argues that, when read in context, López was only giving testimony on historical fact as to the OIC's conclusion that the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*377</span> Defendants' six percent charges for services were unreasonable in light of prevailing market rates.</p>\n<p>We need not decide the issue, because any error in admitting the testimony was harmless, because it would not have \"affected the outcome of the trial.\" <i>United States v. Dunbar,</i> 553 F.3d 48, 59 (1st Cir.2009)(\"`The essential inquiry in harmless error review is whether the improperly admitted evidence likely affected the outcome of the trial.'\") (quoting <i>United States v. Tom,</i> 330 F.3d 83, 95 (1st Cir. 2003)). As noted above, there was <i>no</i> evidence of any authorization for the payments the Defendants received. The Defendants claim prejudice because, they argue, the government relied upon López's testimony at trial in support of its theory that the Union's labor license precluded compensation for Health Plan work, and even cited it in their closing. However, the government argued below, as here, that no provision in the constitution, collective bargaining agreement, the Health Plan by-laws, or any other document provided authority for the payments. Moreover, no mention was made of López's testimony in the government's closing. Thus, for all of the above reasons, the evidence was sufficient to permit a rational jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendants acted without authority.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>c. \"knowingly and willfully\"</h2>\n<p>The Defendants finally argue with respect to the embezzlement convictions that the government had not met their burden to prove that the Defendants acted with the requisite criminal intent to be convicted of embezzlement.</p>\n<p>To establish an individual defendant's willing and knowing participation in a conspiracy as in this case, the government \"need not prove that [he] knew all the details ... or participated in all of the objectives ... of the conspiracy.\" <i>United States v. Brandon,</i> 17 F.3d 409, 428 (1st Cir.1994). The prosecution need only \"show knowledge of the basic agreement,\" with \"an intent to commit the underlying substantive offense.\" <i>Id.</i> The requisite knowledge and intent can be proven through \"circumstantial evidence, including inferences from ... acts committed by the defendant that furthered the conspiracy's purposes.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>With respect to the Top Four Defendants, the evidence of their knowledge and willfulness with respect to the embezzlement convictions was more than sufficient. They all essentially argue that their actions were done in good faith. However, the evidence conclusively contradicts this assertion.</p>\n<p>We start with Lugo and Román. Among other things, the evidence showed that Lugo and Román, as president and treasurer of both the Union and the Health Plan, had signing authority over all of the bank accounts at issue in this case, and thus signed all of the checks and other documents authorizing the transfer of funds to and from various bank accounts. Lugo and Román also signed off on regular checks made out to themselves and the other Defendants which were deposited into personal accounts. Their consenting signatures are also on Health Plan tax returns that omitted these payments.</p>\n<p>Lugo and Román were also instrumental in the creation of the administrative services contract, under which the Union leaders paid themselves a six percent of Health Plan funds for administering the Health Plan. They also provided vague and misleading responses about the specifics of the contract during the course of the OIC's investigation. The administration contract was ultimately found to be invalid by the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*378</span> OIC after it was discovered that the fees the Union charged were substantially above market rates and concerns about the legitimacy of the arrangement were uncovered. Despite being informed of this decision, Lugo and Román continued issuing personal payments from Union controlled funds, which further showed their intent. <i>Cf. Young,</i> 955 F.2d at 103-04 (evidence sufficient to show intent to embezzle where defendant's \"falsification\" to a government agency \"reveal[ed] a consciousness of guilt\" (quotation omitted)). Thus, through all of these actions, both Lugo and Román displayed knowledge and willfulness with respect to the embezzlement scheme in this case.</p>\n<p>The same is largely true of the actions of Carrasquillo. Even though he lacked signing authority, Carrasquillo controlled the Union and Health Plan accounts after Román's retirement in April 2004. He was also consistently obstructive when the OIC made inquiries into the administrative services contract. These facts would permit a reasonable jury to conclude that Carrasquillo was knowingly involved in an embezzlement scheme.</p>\n<p>García, like Lugo and Carrasquillo, also played a significant role in the implementation of the administrative service contract. Although she insists that she was cooperative with the OIC in her investigation, which she asserts is proof that she did not have the intent to embezzle, her role in creating the administrative contract itself (and providing the forged minutes to support the contract) provides substantial evidence of her intent.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, none of the Top Four Defendants included any of the income they received as compensation from the Health Plan in their tax returns and, when confronted with evidence of their scheme, promptly reported the income, literally within days of each other. That alone is significant evidence of their knowledge and willfulness. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Fusaro,</i> 708 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir.1983) (\"Fusaro's active participation in so many aspects of the scheme as well as his attempts to cover up the scheme as it unraveled, likewise, provides the basis for the inference that he acted with the requisite intent and knowledge.\").</p>\n<p>The Top Four Defendants each argue that their failure to file taxes on their Health Plan income is evidence of tax evasion, but not of embezzlement. However, as noted below, the jurors were instructed that \"the case that is before us ... has nothing to do with tax evasion,\" and jurors are presumed to follow instructions. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Bradshaw,</i> 281 F.3d 278, 285 (1st Cir.2002) (\"[I]t is routinely presumed that jurors will follow curative instructions....\"). In any event, the Defendants conveniently only failed to report their <i>Health Plan</i> income, thus permitting a rational jury to conclude that the Defendants were not simply engaging in tax evasion.</p>\n<p>The issue is much closer with respect to the Chapter President Defendants. As noted below, the evidence was insufficient to support their convictions for money laundering because minutes establishing their knowledge turned out to be forged. Moreover, unlike the Top Four Defendants, the Chapter Presidents had no authority over any of the Union-controlled accounts.</p>\n<p>The government does not dispute that the Chapter President Defendants' role in the crime was more limited than that of the other Defendants, but argues that the evidence was still sufficient to establish their intent. The government primarily argues that the Defendants were willfully blind to the scheme, and points out that the district court in this case provided a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*379</span> willful blindness instruction.<sup>[36]</sup> The government points out that, despite the forged minutes, García certified to the OIC that \"all ... members\" of the Health Plan's board of directors \"discuss[ed] and analyze[d] the diversity of administrative issues of their incumbency on a daily basis.\" The government also points out that Clotilde Díaz, who ran the Union's cafeteria, testified that \"all\" the Defendants would have lunch together \"every day whenever they were there.\" The government finally points out that the Health Plan's bylaws required the Defendants to \"manage[]\" the Plan and \"oversee[] the faithful compliance with the laws and regulations applicable to the operation of\" the Health Plan, such that the jury could infer that the Chapter President Defendants knew that there was nothing that authorized them to receive payments.</p>\n<p>The Chapter President Defendants respond by pointing out that García's certification is far from credible. Moreover, Díaz's testimony, to the extent that it can be interpreted to mean that the Defendants ate lunch \"every day,\" was belied by the lunch tickets presented at trial, which only showed that they met with the Top Four Defendants infrequently, if at all.</p>\n<p>The evidence in support of willful blindness is sparse, at best. Willful blindness requires evidence that the Chapter Defendants were \"trying to deliberately avoid knowledge\" of the scheme, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Azubike,</i> 564 F.3d 59, 68 (1st Cir.2009), and the government can only muster a few meetings with the Top Four Defendants and some duties on the part of the Chapter President Defendants to manage the Health Plan. None of these actions conclusively show the Chapter President Defendants \"deliberately avoid[ing]\" knowledge of the embezzlement.</p>\n<p>However, like the Top Four Defendants, the Chapter President Defendants failed to report the income they received from the Health Plan in their tax returns, even though the purported Health Plan income was far greater than the other income they reported. More importantly, and also like the Top Four Defendants, they all proceeded to report their payments simultaneously at a time when the OIC was discovering the extent of the scheme. This, along with the other evidence, was sufficient for the jury to conclude by proof beyond a reasonable doubt the element of criminal intent. The Chapter President Defendants argue that they did not know that they had to report the payments and, at worst, only engaged in tax evasion. Although that is one view of their actions, the jury was permitted to conclude that the confluence of events here established their knowledge and willfulness by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Dwinells,</i> 508 F.3d 63, 74 (1st Cir.2007) (\"When the record is fairly susceptible of two competing scenarios, the choice between those scenarios ordinarily is for the jury.\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>The Money Laundering Convictions</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Defendants also challenge the sufficiency of the evidence in support of their money laundering convictions under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1956(a)(1)(A)(i), (a)(1)(B)(i), &amp; (h). 18 U.S.C. § 1956 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote>[w]hoever, knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful <span class=\"star-pagination\">*380</span> activity, conducts or attempts to conduct such a financial transaction which in fact involves the proceeds of specified unlawful activity[,] ... knowing that the transaction is designed in whole or in part ... to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds of the specified unlawful activity[,] ... shall be sentenced to a fine ... or imprisonment ... or both.</blockquote>\n<p>18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Cruzado-Laureano,</i> 404 F.3d 470, 483 (1st Cir.2005) (discussing elements of money laundering).</p>\n<p>As an initial matter, the government concedes that the money laundering convictions of the Chapter President DefendantsCaraballo, Andino, Martínez, Ramos, Vázquez, Urbina, and Roldánmust be reversed for insufficient evidence, as a result of the expert testimony that the meeting minutes, upon which their knowledge of the money laundering scheme was based, were forgeries. Thus, we only address the claims of the Top Four Defendants.</p>\n<p>To recap, the money laundering convictions were based on loans provided to the Health Plan by the Union through the Welfare Account. Because the Welfare Account (which did not appear in either the Union or Health Plan books) consisted solely of Health Plan contributions, the Health Plan, in effect, was loaning money to itself. These \"fake\" loans were an attempt to launder the Plan funds for use by the Defendants, since the money paid back to the Union by the Health Plan, in the government's words, \"would look like fulfillment of a legitimate loan obligation,\" plus interest to boot. To further conceal the scheme, Lugo, Román, and García submitted paperwork to the OIC authorizing the Health Plan's administrator to seek the loans in question. The paperwork represented that the Union would be lending Union funds, which was not the case, as transaction records show that the money came from the Welfare Account. When Luciano, the Health Plan's accountant, pointed out the misrepresentation, he was fired. Moreover, the government's documents expert, LaPorte, testified that the Health Plan's minute book was doctored to reflect meetings that were never held.</p>\n<p>Román and Lugo argue that their convictions should be set aside in light of <i>United States v. Santos,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 2020, 170 L.Ed.2d 912 (2008), where a plurality concluded that the term \"proceeds\" under § 1956(a)(1) means \"profits\" rather than \"receipts.\" <i>See id.</i> at 2031. There is some question whether <i>Santos</i> applies to this case. <i>Santos</i> concerned money laundering convictions based on payments to winners and employees of an illegal gambling operation, and applying the money laundering statute to such essential steps of the gambling operation raised a significant merger problem. <i>Id.</i> 2026. Such a merger problem is not present here, where the \"fake loan\" scheme was in addition to the Defendants' embezzlement scheme, was not essential to it, and was concocted after the embezzlement scheme was in effect. Moreover, there is some question as to the holding of <i>Santos,</i> since Justice Stevens, the fifth and deciding vote, suggested in concurrence that the holding may vary by offense and the legislative history. <i>See id.</i> at 2032-33; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Kratt,</i> 579 F.3d 558, 562 (6th Cir.2009) (interpreting <i>Santos</i> to apply when application of § 1956 \"creates a merger problem that leads to a radical increase in the statutory maximum sentence and only when nothing in the legislative history suggests that Congress intended such an increase\"). But even if <i>Santos</i> applied, the transactions at issue clearly concerned the \"profits\" of the embezzlement <span class=\"star-pagination\">*381</span> scheme, given the large amounts of Health Plan funds diverted and the minimal expenses to do it. <i>See </i><i>Santos,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 2029 (stating that \"to establish the proceeds element under the `profits' interpretation, the prosecution needs to show only that a single instance of specified unlawful activity was profitable and gave rise to the money involved in a charged transaction\").</p>\n<p>Román and Lugo, along with the remaining Top Four Defendants Carrasquillo and García, also argue that they did not embezzle Health Plan funds at all, let alone engage in money laundering. For the reasons discussed above, we reject the claim. Lugo and Román separately argue that only a \"bumbling bunch of conspirators would conspire to hide proceeds of an activity they knew to be illegal by writing themselves checks and cashing them in their own names.\" But that is no defense. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Majors,</i> 196 F.3d 1206, 1214 (11th Cir.1999) (\"Moving money through a large number of accounts\" may suffice to prove money laundering even where the defendant \"withdr[aws] [funds from accounts] in his own name\") (citations omitted); <i>United States v. Sutera,</i> 933 F.2d 641, 648 (8th Cir.1991) (\"[T]he money laundering statute does not require the jury to find that [the defendant] did a good job laundering the proceeds.\"). Carrasquillo argues that he opened the Welfare Account to avoid fines for depositing unapproved rates. His actions betray this excuse, as Carrasquillo could have simply asked for an approved rate, the Defendants continued to use unapproved rates after establishment of the Welfare Account, and the Union was fined anyway. Thus, a rational jury could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that Carrasquillo created this excuse to conceal the loan scheme. We thus conclude that the evidence was more than sufficient to support the money laundering convictions with respect to the Top Four Defendants.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Jury Instructions</h2>\n<p>Defendants also challenge several jury instructions provided at trial. As we have previously stated,</p>\n<blockquote>We review a properly preserved objection to \"the form and wording\" of an instruction given by the district court for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. McFarlane,</i> 491 F.3d 53, 59 (1st Cir. 2007). \"While we would review <i>de novo</i> a claim that an instruction embodied an error of law,\" we also \"review for abuse of discretion `whether the instructions adequately explained the law or whether they tended to confuse or mislead the jury on the controlling issues.'\" <i>United States v. Silva,</i> 554 F.3d 13, 21 (1st Cir.2009) (quoting <i>United States v. Ranney,</i> 298 F.3d 74, 79 (1st Cir.2002)). A trial court's refusal to give a particular instruction is reversible error only in the \"relatively rare case\" in which \"the requested instruction was (1) substantively correct; (2) not substantially covered elsewhere in the charge; and (3) concerned a sufficiently important point that the failure to give it seriously impaired the defendant's ability to present his or her defense.\" <i>United States v. Prigmore,</i> 243 F.3d 1, 17 (1st Cir.2001).</blockquote>\n<p><i>United States v. González,</i> 570 F.3d 16, 21 (1st Cir.2009). Furthermore, \"[a]ny error, defect, irregularity, or variance that does not affect substantial rights must be disregarded.\" Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a) (setting forth harmless error standard).<sup>[37]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*382</span> Where the defendants fail to object to the court's jury instructions at trial, we review for plain error. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Griffin,</i> 524 F.3d 71, 76 (1st Cir.2008). To establish plain error, a defendant \"must show an error that was plain, (i.e., obvious and clear under current law), prejudicial (i.e., affected the outcome of the district court proceedings), and that seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<blockquote>This standard is so demanding that we have characterized it as \"cold comfort to most defendants pursuing claims of instructional error,\" <i>United States v. Medina-Martínez,</i> 396 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2005), because, \"[w]hile reversal of a conviction predicated on unpreserved jury error is theoretically possible, ... [it is] the rare case in which an improper instruction will justify reversal of a criminal conviction when no objection has been made in the trial court.\" <i>United States v. Weston,</i> 960 F.2d 212, 216 (1st Cir.1992).</blockquote>\n<p><i>González,</i> 570 F.3d at 21 (modification in the original).</p>\n<p>Finally, the Supreme Court has \"repeatedly... cautioned that instructions must be evaluated not in isolation but in the context of the entire charge.\" <i>Jones v. United States,</i> 527 U.S. 373, 391, 119 S.Ct. 2090, 144 L.Ed.2d 370 (1999).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Embezzlement Instruction</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The Defendants first challenge certain portions of the district court's \"legal background\" as part of the court's instruction concerning 18 U.S.C. § 669. They do not challenge the instructions on the elements of § 669 themselves. Rather, the Defendants challenge the following: (a) the district court's instruction that AAA's contributions were Health Plan assets for purposes of § 669; (b) the district court's instruction with respect to commingling; and (c) its instruction concerning \"fiduciary principles.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. instruction that AAA's contributions belonged to Health Plan</h2>\n<p>The Defendants challenge the following instruction given by the district court:</p>\n<blockquote>[T]he [H]ealth [P]lan had a vested property interest in [the AAA's monthly] contributions[,] such [that] they constitute health plan assets under 18 U.S.Code, Section 669.</blockquote>\n<p>The Defendants argue that, by instructing the jury that the Plan had a \"vested property interest\" in the AAA monthly contributions, the district court took from the jury \"an essential element of the government's case.\" For support, the Defendants cite <i>United States v. Alessio,</i> where we reversed and remanded for a new trial when the district court made a \"finding\" during the relevant witness's testimony that the specific funds the defendant allegedly misdirected under Section 641 were \"the property of the United States.\" 439 F.2d 803, 804 (1st Cir.1971) (per curiam). Moreover, the Defendants argue that the instruction is at odds with the government's concession in <i>Jackson</i> that employer contributions to an ERISA plan \"themselves are not assets of [a] plan until the contributions are paid to the plan.\" <i>Jackson,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 1307, 173 L.Ed.2d 575.</p>\n<p>This case is distinguishable from <i>Alessio.</i> Unlike in <i>Alessio,</i> the district court did not instruct the jury that the funds the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*383</span> Defendants <i>actually</i> embezzled were Health Plan funds. Rather, and as the government correctly points out, the district court simply described that the AAA contributions <i>generally</i> were for the Health Plan, and specifically charged the jury with determining \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" whether the <i>specific</i> \"payments that came into the ... possession of the defendants\" were Plan funds. <i>Cf. </i><i>Evans,</i> 572 F.2d at 471, 473 (in § 641 embezzlement case, affirming use of jury instruction describing \"federal character of the monies generally involved\").</p>\n<p>However, the instruction is in some tension with the government's concession in <i>Jackson.</i> Although here we express some doubt that <i>Jackson</i> applies to this case, we conclude that any error was harmless. First, and as noted above, the district court did not instruct the jury as to any element of the offense, and thus the Defendants were free to argue their theories to the jury. Second, and as discussed in more detail above, at all relevant times most or all of the Health Plan contributions were, in fact, deposited in the Plan Account to conclusively establish that the Health Plan had a \"vested property interest\" in the funds.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. commingling instruction</h2>\n<p>The district court instructed that, \"[b]ecause the [H]ealth [P]lan fund[s] [were] not ... [U]nion property,\" they \"should not\" as a general matter have been \"commingled with other [U]nion funds.\" It went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote>[t]he mere fact that funds may have been transferred from other accounts or commingled with other [U]nion funds is not enough to create criminal liability. Such co[m]mingling could have occurred for a number of reasons, such as bad advice from accountants, bad management practices on the part of some officer or officers, or because of mistakes or other innocent reasons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>But when the diversion is knowingly and willfully made into other [U]nion accounts, unrelated to the [H]ealth [P]lan, with intent to embezzle or with intent to resupply [Union money], then we [have] conduct that may constitute a federal offense under 18 U.S.Code, Section 669.</blockquote>\n<p>\"[A]t the risk of repetition,\" the court further stated:</p>\n<blockquote>remember that the commingling of funds standing alone, without proof of criminal intent proven beyond a reasonable doubt, cannot ... give rise to criminal liability. Precisely and for this reason, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt, by either direct or... circumstantial evidence[,] that the commingling of funds was part of the criminal plan to embezzle [P]lan funds, monies or assets. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt of each and every element of the offense charged is required for the government to establish that [the] charged conduct is criminal in nature[,] and that of course is for you to decide.</blockquote>\n<p>The Defendants contend that the district court improperly instructed the jury that commingling is illegal per se.<sup>[38]</sup> But the plain terms of the charge did not provide such an instruction. The district court did not instruct the jury that commingling is per se illegal. Instead, as shown above, the district court repeatedly emphasized that \"[t]he mere fact that funds may have been transferred from other accounts or commingled with other [U]nion funds <i>is not enough to create criminal liability.</i>\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*384</span> (Emphasis added). We thus reject the Defendants' claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>c. \"legal principles\" instruction</h2>\n<p>The Defendants challenge a \"legal principles\" instruction that the district court provided <i>sua sponte.</i> The district court instructed the jury that:</p>\n<blockquote>When persons hold money in trust for other persons, or for particular purposes, they have a fiduciary duty to use the trusted funds in good faith and in a scrupulous manner, acting always in the best interests of the beneficiaries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Duties general to any fiduciary relationship arise when the trust in question is, as here, a health care benefit program. You, the jury, may consider in your evaluation of the evidence whether and to what extent the government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt in this case that these fiduciary rules were or were not followed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>And there are some rules I'm going to give you as guidelines. These may not be the only rules. You may think of other rules or principles that are so obvious that I may not even put in here to give you some aid in figuring this out.</blockquote>\n<p>The court then provided a non-exclusive list of fiduciary principles that the jury could \"consider\" in determining whether the government had \"prove[n] beyond a reasonable doubt\" that a particular defendant acted \"knowingly and willfully [with] the intent to embezzle.\" The court stated, in full:</p>\n<blockquote>There are some rules that you may consider in determining whether any of the charged conduct was willfully, knowingly and intentionally made for the purpose of violating the law, or whether the charged conduct was entered into by mistake, bad management or other innocent reasons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Remember that bad management, careless or innocent reasons by themselves do not constitute a crime. Repeating myself a second: The government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the conduct charged in the indictment was knowingly and willfully performed, that is to say, the intent to embezzle or misapply as contemplated in 18 U.S.Code, Section 669.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The first rule that may assist you in figuring out whether criminal intent exists or does not exist is what can be defined as the \"solely-in-the-interest rule.\" This rule requires that management of health plan contributions be solely in the interests of the participants and the beneficiaries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The second rule that may assist you in figuring out whether criminal intent existed or not is the \"exclusive person rule.\" This rule requires that the management of the health plan contributions, or the health plan contributions be for the exclusive purpose of proving benefits to the participants and their beneficiaries; and also for the defraying reasonable expense of administering plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The third rule that you can use in the process of assessing whether criminal intent or noncriminal reasons were behind the charged conduct is the \"prudent person rule.\" Members of the board of directors of the health plan must be prudent persons, executing their fiduciary duties with care, skill, prudence, under the circumstances then prevailing. The prudent person rule requires the trustees to be familiar with the matters of the enterprise for which they act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The fourth rule that may assist you in figuring out whether criminal intent exists, or whether there was no criminal intent in the charged actions, is what I refer to as the \"plan documents rule.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*385</span> Plan documents include managerial organization charts, written descriptions of authorized positions, written descriptions of duties for each position, employment contracts, and any scope that these employment contracts may contain, Board of Directors' decisions and minutes under the legal structure of the plan under its corporate bylaws, and any other contemporaneous document that confirms or denies that the management decisions were made and contemplated as the exclusive purpose, providing benefits to the participants and their beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of administration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The fiduciary must act in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the health plan insofar as such documents and instruments are consistent with the provisions of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>To evaluate and enforce these duties in the context of a criminal statute you may focus not only on the merits of the transaction, but also on the thoroughness of the investigation made by the fiduciaries into the merits of such.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>As I have already advanced, I also instruct you that a good faith or a negligent breach of fiduciary duties, standing alone, does not create a criminal liability, but can be instructed along with other factors mentioned as to whether criminal intent is or is not present.</blockquote>\n<p>The Defendants primarily contend that the district court's instruction as to fiduciary principles were \"lengthy, legally incorrect, and complex,\" such that the district court \"engrafted\" civil ERISA law onto Section 669 and thereby \"relieved the prosecution's evidentiary burden\" to prove all elements beyond a reasonable doubt. They also argue that the Defendants' actions were authorized and that they owed no fiduciary duty, so the instructions were misplaced.</p>\n<p>We agree that the instruction is certainly \"lengthy\" and \"complex.\" Indeed, it is difficult to characterize the instruction as anything but confusing, and we do not sanction it in any way. Nevertheless, \"instructions must be evaluated not in isolation but in the context of the entire charge,\" <i>Jones,</i> 527 U.S. at 391, 119 S.Ct. 2090 (citations omitted), and based upon our review of the instruction as a whole, we conclude that the instruction was harmless. First, although the district court borrowed principles from the ERISA context, the court stated that the jurors \"may consider\" the rules. Second, the district court repeated twice within this instruction that \"[t]he government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the conduct charged in the indictment was knowingly and willfully performed,\" and further instructed on this requirement four other times in the jury charge. Third, the district court instructed the jury at the beginning of its instruction \"that bad management, careless or innocent reasons by themselves do not constitute a crime\" and at the end that \"a good faith or a negligent breach of fiduciary duties, standing alone, does not create a criminal liability.\" Thus, read as a whole, the instruction did not result in an error warranting reversal. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Snyder,</i> 668 F.2d 686, 691 (2d Cir.1982) (\"We agree with appellant that he should not be convicted of a crime merely because he breached his civil fiduciary duties. But [the court] was careful to make that point, and we have no doubt that the jury grasped it.\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Money Laundering Instruction</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Román, Ramos, and Roldán separately argue that the district court erred in instructing on the elements of money laundering under 18 U.S.C. § 1956. The government has conceded that the money laundering convictions against Ramos and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*386</span> Roldán should be reversed. We thus focus on Román.</p>\n<p>The district court gave the following instruction with respect to money laundering:</p>\n<blockquote>First, that a defendant knowingly conducted or attempted to conduct a financial transaction[.] ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Second, [that] the defendant knew that the monies or funds involv[ed] [in the] financial transaction represented the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity, in this case the embezzlement of monies from a health plan organization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Third, that the funds or monies involved in the financial transaction did in fact represent the proceeds of [that] specified [unlawful] activity[.] ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Fourth, that the defendant engaged in [the] financial transaction knowing that the transaction was designed, in whole or in part, <i>to conceal</i> or to disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership or the control of the proceeds of such specified [unlawful] activity.</blockquote>\n<p>Because no defendant objected to the instruction prior to \"the jury retir[ing] to deliberating,\" we review for plain error. <i>See</i> Fed. R. Crim P. 30(d) (\"A party who objects to any portion of the instructions... must inform the court of the specific objection and the grounds for the objection before the jury retires to deliberate.... Failure to object in accordance with this rule precludes appellate review, except as permitted under Rule 52(b).\").</p>\n<p>There was no plain error. Román claims that the district court erred by only instructing the jury as to one theory of money laundering when two were charged, instructing on \"conceal[ment]\" under Section 1956(a)(1)(B)(i), but not on \"to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity\" under Section 1956(a)(1)(A)(i). However, Román cannot show that he was prejudiced because the district court failed to instruct on an alternative government theory. Román also claims that the instruction was \"jumbled,\" but does not explain how the instruction was jumbled, and we thus deem this ground waived. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (\"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\") (citations omitted). Finally, Román cannot show prejudice because the district court did not define \"proceeds\" as \"profits,\" <i>see </i><i>Santos,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 2031 (defining \"proceeds\" as \"profits\" for purposes of the money laundering statute), because, as discussed above, a rational jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that Román in fact engaged in a conspiracy to launder profits.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>Good Faith Instruction</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Román, Ramos, and Roldán also challenge the district court's instruction on good faith. They properly preserved their claim. However, because they only object as to the form and wording of the instruction, we review for abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p>The district court provided the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote>In making a determination of whether a defendant acted with specific criminal intent to embezzle [Health Plan] funds or monies in violation of Section 669 of Title 18, or to conspire to violate Section 669[,] ... you may consider ... whether or not that defendant had a good faith belief that there was authorization by law, and whether or not that defendant had a good faith belief that [his or her] use of the [Plan's] funds was in furtherance of the interest of the [Plan].</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The government has the burden of proving that a defendant acted with the required intent[.] ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*387</span> [G]ood faith is an absolute defense to th[e] charge[s]. Accordingly, the government must prove in ... the case of each defendant, that [1] the defendant did not believe in good faith that the use of the funds ... would benefit the [Health Plan's] participants and beneficiaries[,][and][2] the defendant did not believe in good faith that his or her use of the fund[s] was authorized by the law.</blockquote>\n<p>(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Román, Ramos, and Roldán first argue that the district court erred because the instruction shifted the burden of proof onto the Defendants, \"requiring them to justify what the court clearly saw as some degree of wrongful conduct.\" However, as the quoted section shows, the instruction plainly explains that the government had \"the burden of proving that a defendant acted with the required intent.\" Román, Ramos, and Roldán further argue that the instruction \"eviscerated\" their defense that \"they had a good faith belief that the funds were Union funds.\" Although the instruction sets forth two examples of good faith conduct that the jury \"may\" consider, it did not specifically preclude the Defendant's theory. Thus, although perhaps not the most artful instruction, the district court did not abuse its discretion in providing it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. <i>Rejection of Tax Evasion Instruction</i>\n</h2>\n<p>García, Román, Ramos, Vázquez, and Roldán all argue that the district court erred when it failed to instruct the jury during the jury charge that this is not a tax evasion case. They claim, given the use of tax related evidence during the government's case in chief and closing, that declining their request to repeat the instruction prejudiced them.</p>\n<p>During the government's case-in-chief, however, and at the Defendants' request, the district court did instruct the jury that this was not a tax evasion case. The district court instructed as to the following:</p>\n<blockquote>Members of the jury, this evidence that you are going to receive now regarding the income tax returns, I should tell you that ... the case that is before us ... has nothing to do with tax evasion. Tax evasion is exclusively under the jurisdiction of the state courts, not the federal courts. And the evidence is being allowed because the Government needs to present evidence as part of their effort to prove a number of elements in the federal offenses which they think have something to do with this. That is, of course, for you to decide at the end of the case, on the basis of the instructions that I will give you. And that is the only purpose. So this is not a tax evasion case. This is a healthcare programs fraud case. That is what it is.</blockquote>\n<p>None of the above Defendants objected to the district court's decision not to provide the same instruction during the jury charge, only Caraballo did, who does not join this argument on appeal. Thus, we review for plain error. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 30(a) (\"Any party may request in writing that the court instruct the jury on the law as specified in the request. The request must be made at the close of the evidence or at any earlier time that the court reasonably sets.\"); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Harris,</i> 104 F.3d 1465, 1471 (5th Cir.1997) (\"[T]he greater weight of authority counsels that a party can rely upon the objection of his codefendant only if he joins in the objection,\" citing cases).</p>\n<p>The above Defendants claim prejudice, but it is difficult to see how, when the mid-trial instruction was correct, and case law presumes that \"jurors ... follow the trial judge's instructions.\" <i>United States v. Torres,</i> 162 F.3d 6, 12 (1st Cir.1998); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Rivera-Gómez,</i> 67 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*388</span> F.3d 993, 999 (1st Cir.1995) (\"[J]urors are not children.\") <i>overruled on other grounds by </i><i>Jones v. United States,</i> 526 U.S. 227, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999). Moreover, García specifically argues that prejudice may have resulted from the government's closing, but the government reminded the jurors in closing that \"[t]his is not a tax evasion case.\" We thus see no error.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Trial Procedure</h2>\n<p>The Defendants also raise a number of issues with respect to the district court's management of the trial.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Mid-Trial Severance Challenge</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Vázquez separately contends that the district court abused its discretion when it refused to grant a mid-trial severance based on his attorney's alleged conflict of interest. Vázquez argues that he was discouraged from testifying by his counsel as a result of this asserted conflict, affecting the outcome of the proceedings.</p>\n<p>As background, Francisco Dolz, counsel for Andino, informed the government during its case-in-chief that Angel Tapia, counsel for Vázquez, had admitted to doctoring minutes concerning the Welfare Account. The government filed a sealed motion informing the district court of the allegation, and requested a hearing. The court held a hearing that same day, with Dolz testifying that Tapia had admitted to him that Tapia's handwriting appeared on the doctored minutes. The district court ordered Tapia to respond, and the next day Tapia declared that the allegation was \"totally untrue,\" but that the allegation created \"a conflict of interest\" that required severing Vázquez's case mid-trial. The district court denied the motion, finding no conflict, but further required Tapia to respond to the allegation in writing. Tapia filed a sworn statement, stating that \"I have never told attorney Francisco Dolz expressions to the effect that I have altered any minute or any document of any kind of the [Union],\" and further stating that the allegation was based on a misunderstanding.</p>\n<p>Vázquez appeals the denial of his mid-trial severance motion. Since a \"mid-trial severance is ... an extraordinary measure,\" we will \"overturn [a denial for severance] only if [the court's] wide discretion is plainly abused.\" <i>United States v. Sotomayor-Vázquez,</i> 249 F.3d 1, 17 (1st Cir.2001) (citations and quotations omitted). Moreover, where, as here, a defendant claims that a conflict of interest warrants a new trial, he \"must show that the lawyer could have pursued a plausible alternative defense strategy or tactic and that the alternative strategy or tactic was inherently in conflict with or not undertaken due to the attorney's other interests or loyalties.\" <i>Id.</i> at 15 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>Vázquez contends that Tapia's conflict of interest, particularly his purportedly doctoring the Welfare Account minutes, caused Tapia to discourage Vázquez from testifying. However, Vázquez's claim of \"intimidation\" has no support in the record, and Vázquez does not cite to any. Furthermore, Vázquez failed to file any pro se motion contending that Tapia discouraged him from testifying, or claimed that he was prevented from doing so. In any event, the proper vehicle for relief for ineffective assistance of counsel is a motion under 28 U.S.C. § 2255, not direct appeal. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Genao,</i> 281 F.3d 305, 313 (1st Cir.2002) (\"[W]e do not entertain ineffective assistance claims on direct appeal absent an evidentiary record that allows us to evaluate the fact-specific allegations. The preferable vehicle for such claims is a collateral proceeding under 28 U.S.C. § 2255.\") (citation omitted).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*389</span> Given the lack of any record support to substantiate Vázquez's claim, and the process afforded to Vázquez by the district court, it is hard to see any abuse of discretion on the part of the district court in denying a severance. Accordingly, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to sever mid-trial.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Misstatement in Closing Argument</i>\n</h2>\n<p>García and Vázquez both argue that the district court abused its discretion when it declined to grant them a new trial based on an alleged misstatement made during the prosecution's closing argument.</p>\n<p>As we noted earlier, during the strike in 2004, the Union paid each of its members $300 every two weeks. In its rebuttal closing argument, the prosecution argued that (1) this money came from the Union Account; (2) the Union Account contained Health Plan funds; and (3) the Plan thus helped pay for the strike, even though its funds were not meant for that purpose. The prosecutor further stated:</p>\n<blockquote>I did my math. And it's approximately $5.8 million that the [U]nion dished out for those picketing workers on the lines, the striking people, the people that were out. And I'm not saying that those people don't deserve to get monies. I'm saying not from health care funds. Where did the [U]nion get $5.8 million during the strike? Where did the [U]nion get the money to pay Héctor René Lugo and all these people?</blockquote>\n<p>None of the defendants contemporaneously objected to this line of argument during the closing itself, but they all objected at a sidebar afterward. They claimed that the argument was \"false\" because, according to them, the money for the picketing workers came from a Union \"strike fund,\" not from Health Plan funds. The district court overruled the objection.</p>\n<p>As García and Vázquez preserved their claim, we review <i>de novo</i> whether the prosecution's remarks were improper. <i>United States v. Nelson-Rodríguez,</i> 319 F.3d 12, 38 (1st Cir.2003); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Robinson,</i> 473 F.3d 387, 393 (1st Cir.2007) (\"We review <i>de novo</i> whether a challenged statement by the prosecutor during closing argument was improper.\") However, we review for \"manifest abuse of discretion\" a district court's \"refusal to grant a new trial.\" <i>United States v. Potter,</i> 463 F.3d 9, 22 (1st Cir.2006). Even if the remarks are improper, we affirm unless they prejudiced the defendant. <i>United States v. Joyner,</i> 191 F.3d 47, 53 (1st Cir.1999). We consider the following factors in considering prejudice:</p>\n<blockquote>(1) the severity of the prosecutor's misconduct, including whether it was deliberate or accidental; (2) the context in which the misconduct occurred; (3) whether the judge gave curative instructions and the likely effect of such instructions; and (4) the strength of the evidence against the defendants.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Nelson-Rodríguez,</i> 319 F.3d at 38 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p>García and Vázquez contend that the government's remarks at closing were improper, claiming that (1) the Union paid the striking workers from \"Banco Santander [Account] No. XXXXXXXXXX\"; (2) that the account belonged to the Union, not the Health Plan; and (3) the Plan thus did not help pay for the strike, and the prosecution, in arguing to the contrary, had \"misstate[d] evidence\" and \"misl[e]d the jury.\" In response, the government contends that \"Banco Santander No. 1310003987\" <i>was</i> the Union Account, as defined in the indictment, and, since the Plan funds were diverted to that Account, the government's remarks were factually accurate.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*390</span> Even if improper, the remarks had no effect on the trial outcome, as the case concerned not <i>how</i> the striking workers were paid, but whether the Defendants paid themselves with money they knew did not belong to them. At best, this is a \"stray remark\" that is too inconsequential to warrant reversal. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Martínez-Medina,</i> 279 F.3d 105, 119 (1st Cir.2002). Finally, as correctly noted by the government, the district court instructed the jury that closing statements are \"not evidence.\" Accordingly, we see no reversible error.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>Post-Trial Threats and Harassment</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Caraballo, Andino, and Urbina argue that the district court abused its discretion in declining to grant them a new trial based on their post-trial allegations that Lugo and others discouraged them, through threats and harassment, from testifying.</p>\n<p>As background, the Defendants were found guilty on June 16, 2006. Six months later, during a December 6, 2006 sentencing hearing, Urbina alleged for the first time that Lugo and other unnamed individuals had issued veiled threats that had discouraged him, Caraballo, and Andino from testifying at trial on their own behalf. Urbina further asserted that he, Caraballo, and Andino would have testified that they were not at the purported board meetings concerning the loans from the Union to the Health Plan.</p>\n<p>On February 2, 2007, Caraballo, Andino, and Urbina moved for a new trial, arguing that the alleged threats constituted \"newly discovered evidence\" under Rule 33(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The district court denied the motion, finding that any threats had not been \"serious enough\" to dissuade the defendants from testifying and that their decision not to testify was in fact a \"strateg[ic]\" one.</p>\n<p>Caraballo, Andino, and Urbina renew their arguments on appeal, and contend that they are entitled to a new trial. \"We review a district court's denial of a new trial motion for manifest abuse of discretion.\" <i>United States v. Del-Valle,</i> 566 F.3d 31, 38 (1st Cir.2009). \"The remedy of a new trial must be used sparingly, and only where a miscarriage of justice would otherwise result.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>United States v. Conley,</i> 249 F.3d 38, 45 (1st Cir.2001)).</p>\n<blockquote>A defendant who seeks a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence bears a `weighty burden' of establishing that: (1) the evidence was unknown or unavailable to the defendant at the time of trial; (2) failure to learn of the evidence was not due to lack of diligence by the defendant; (3) the evidence is material and not merely cumulative or impeaching; and (4) the emergence of the evidence will probably result in an acquittal upon retrial of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>There was no abuse of discretion. First, if their claims of threats were true, then obviously they would have known about the threats during trial. Thus, their evidence cannot be \"newly discovered,\" as they cannot claim that the threats were \"unknown or unavailable to [them] at the time of trial.\" <i>See </i><i>United States v. Wright,</i> 625 F.2d 1017, 1019 (1st Cir.1980). Second, they cannot show any prejudice. This is because their claim that they would have testified that they did not participate in purported board meetings concerning the loans from the Union to the Health Plan would have <i>supported</i> the government's theory that these meetings never occurred and that minutes over those loan meetings were doctored.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*391</span> D. Sentencing</h2>\n<p>Finally, some of the Defendants appeal their sentences. As a threshold matter, the government concedes that, because the convictions for the Seven Chapter Presidents for money laundering must be set aside, they are entitled to resentencing. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Meader,</i> 195 F.3d 66, 68 (1st Cir.1999) (resentencing appropriate where the Court \"[could] not say that the trial judge would have reached the same sentence within the range\"). Since the government concedes that the Chapter President Defendants are entitled to resentencing, we decline to address any of their arguments with respect to their sentences. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Pinillos-Prieto,</i> 419 F.3d 61, 74-75 &amp; n. 14 (1st Cir. 2005) (declining to reach drug quantity claims given vacatur and remand of sentences in light of government's concession of <i>Booker</i> error). We thus address only the sentencing challenges of the Top Four Defendants, and do not discuss the merits of the other Defendants' sentencing challenges.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Loss Calculation Enhancement</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Some of the Top Four Defendants contend that the district court erred in assessing against each of the defendants an 18-level enhancement under the Sentencing Guidelines based on a \"loss\" calculation of between $2,500,000 and $7,000,000.</p>\n<p>\"Under the advisory guidelines regime, the district court can use the preponderance of the evidence standard to determine whether an enhancement applies.\" <i>United States v. Pierre,</i> 484 F.3d 75, 89 (1st Cir.2007) (quoting <i>United States v. Holliday,</i> 457 F.3d 121, 130 (1st Cir.2006)). Accordingly, we review the district court's \"factbound\" determinations for purposes of sentencing for clear error. <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>United States v. Ventura,</i> 353 F.3d 84, 89 (1st Cir.2003)).</p>\n<p>As background, the district court applied U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(1) (2005), and applied an 18-level enhancement for each defendant under Section 2B1.1(b)(1)(J), since the loss amount the court calculated (approximately $5.5 million, with $1.1 million added to Lugo and Román for misapplying additional funds) was between $2.5 million and $7.5 million. Application Note 3(E)(I) to U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(1) provides an offset for \"[t]he money returned, and the fair market value of the property returned and the services rendered, by the defendant or other persons acting jointly with the defendant, to the victim before the offense was detected.\" We review the district court's determination for clear error.</p>\n<p>On appeal, the Top Four Defendants all challenge the district court's loss calculation on two grounds: (1) none of them could have foreseen the amounts that each of the other defendants would receive, such that each defendant's loss amount should, at the most, be the amount he or she <i>individually</i> received; <i>see </i><i>United States v. Codarcea,</i> 505 F.3d 68, 72 (1st Cir.2007) (under Section 2B1.1, a conspirator will be held accountable for losses within the scope of a conspiracy that \"would have been foreseeable by a reasonable person in [the conspirator's] shoes\"); and (2) the court should have credited them for \"services rendered.\"</p>\n<p>The first ground fails. The Top Four Defendants' extensive knowledge and control of the embezzlement scheme as a whole made the total amount foreseeable. As to the second ground, the Top Four Defendants premise their argument on the fact that their scheme was detected in 2004, but the evidence shows that the date of detection was as early as 2000, when the OIC audited the Health Plan. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*392</span> § 2B1.1 cmt. n. 3(E)(I) (defining \"time of detection\" as \"the earlier of (I) the time of the offense was discovered by a victim or government agency; or (II) the time the defendant knew or reasonably should have known that the offense was detected or about to be detected by a victim or government agency\"). By that time, the evidence showed that the AAA paid $1.2 million pursuant to the \"labor license.\" Assuming the same amount for services rendered to the Plan, it would not lower the total amount embezzled below the $2.5 million threshold for the enhancement. Thus, we find no error.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Lugo Enhancements</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Lugo separately argues that the court's factual findings with respect to his sentencing enhancements for (1) using sophisticated means, (2) deriving more than $1,000,000 from a financial institution, and (3) organizing or leading an extensive criminal activity, were clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p>As background, at Lugo's sentencing, the district court assessed a base offense level of seven, pursuant to U.S.S.G. §§ 2S1.1(a)(1) &amp; 2B1.1(a)(1), and then the following enhancements: an 18-level loss enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(1), as already discussed; a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2S1.1(b)(2)(B), because Lugo was convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1956; a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3, because Lugo abused a position of trust; a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(9)(C), because Lugo used \"sophisticated means\" in committing the offense; a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(14)(A), because Lugo derived more than $1,000,000 in gross receipts from a \"financial institution[ ]\"; and a four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(a), because Lugo was an \"organizer or leader\" of an extensive criminal activity involving five or more participants. Lugo objected to the enhancements for using sophisticated means, deriving more than $1,000,000 from a financial institution, and organizing or leading an extensive criminal activity. The district court overruled his objections.</p>\n<p>As Lugo preserved his claims, we review the district court's factual findings supporting these enhancements for clear error.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. sophisticated means</h2>\n<p>As to using sophisticated means, Lugo used several Union Accounts (the Infrastructure Account, the Administrative Account, and the Welfare Account) to conceal and move millions of dollars. The record also shows that Lugo filed fraudulent tax returns and that he participated in doctoring minutes of meetings. These are sufficient \"sophisticated means\" to support the enhancement. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Edelmann,</i> 458 F.3d 791, 816 (8th Cir. 2006) (affirming where the defendant \"created and used numerous false documents,\" \"including multiple years of federal tax returns,\" fake loan documents, and misleading bank statements; even assuming the component parts of the scheme were not complex, \"the total scheme was sophisticated\"). The only things that Lugo raises in response are the same claims that support his sufficiency claims, which we have already rejected.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. $1,000,000 in gross receipts from a \"financial institution[ ]\"</h2>\n<p>As to \"deriving more than $1,000,000 from a financial institution,\" Lugo argues that the Plan does not qualify as a \"financial institution.\" However, U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1 cmt. n. 1 defines a \"financial institution\" as the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Financial institution\" includes any ... union or employee pension <span class=\"star-pagination\">*393</span> fund; any health, medical, or hospital insurance association;... and any similar entity, whether or not insured by the federal government. \"Union or employee pension fund\" and \"any health, medical, or hospital insurance association,\" primarily include large pension funds that serve many persons ... and associations that undertake to provide pension, disability, or other benefits (e.g., medical or hospitalization insurance) to large numbers of persons.</blockquote>\n<p>The Health Plan clearly falls within this definition. We thus reject Lugo's claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>c. \"organizer or leader\"</h2>\n<p>As to his \"organizer or leader\" enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(a), Lugo argues that the district court clearly erred in imposing the enhancement because, he claims, there was no evidence that Lugo managed participants. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Cali,</i> 87 F.3d 571, 578 (1st Cir.1996) (noting that, \"[i]n the past, we have required some `degree of control or organizational authority over others' to support a section 3B1.1(b) adjustment\"). Lugo, in particular, argues that the district court clearly erred when it found at sentencing that Lugo \"recruit[ed]\" the other Defendants to participate in the scheme, as all of the Defendants were elected to their positions. But such a finding is not clearly erroneous given that the evidence showed his extensive coordination of the various activities engaged in by the Defendants, such as falsifying loan documents, doctoring minutes, and bamboozling the OIC concerning the administrative services contract. Thus, his coordination supports a reasonable inference that he recruited the others to participate. In any event, his involvement in all of these activities supports the district court's ultimate finding that \"[f]rankly, this [crime] would not have happened [but] for the fact that [Lugo] was there.\" Finally, Lugo seizes on the district court's statement that \"[t]here is no leader here,\" but the district court made this statement in response to defense counsel's statement that the Defendants \"were elected by the <i>leadership.</i>\" (Emphasis added). Read in context, the statement only corrects defense counsel's statement. Accordingly, the district court did not err in imposing the enhancement.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>Substantive Reasonableness</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Finally, Lugo and Román challenge the substantive reasonableness of their sentences under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), citing their old age and poor health. Lugo separately challenges the disparity between his sentence and that of Román. Lugo was sentenced to 210 months and Román to 108 months.</p>\n<p>We review a substantive reasonableness challenge under an \"abuse-of-discretion standard.\" <i>Gall v. United States,</i> 552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Specifically, we review a within Guidelines sentence only for whether it represents \"a defensible overall result.\" <i>United States v. Jiménez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d 514, 518 (1st Cir.2006) (en banc).</p>\n<p>We conclude that the result here was defensible. Román claims that nine years \"is a very long time\" for someone with his health conditions, but fails to show that he cannot get adequate medical care in prison. Neither does Lugo, who makes the same argument. Given the severity and sophistication of their offenses, their sentences are appropriate despite their ages. Lugo separately emphasizes the disparity between his sentence (210 months) and Román's sentence (108), arguing that their <span class=\"star-pagination\">*394</span> sentences must be \"aligned\" because the \"disparit[y][is] conspicuous and threaten[s] to undermine confidence in the criminal justice system.\" <i>United States v. Martin,</i> 520 F.3d 87, 94 (1st Cir.2008). However, we leave such alignment to the discretion of the district court, <i>see id.,</i> and the district court did not abuse its discretion here, where Lugo's longer sentence is justified by, among other things, the fact that he embezzled double the amount of funds as did Román. For all of these reasons, we reject their claims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the forgoing reasons, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed in part, Reversed in part, and Remanded.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Second Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  At trial, José Nieves, AAA's Labor Relations manager labor, testified that SINOT was a Spanish acronym for \"temporary disability insurance, occupational insurance.\"</p>\n<p>[2]  The collective bargaining agreement relevant to this appeal was in effect from 1998 until 2003. Afterwards, and as discussed below, the Union went on strike after negotiations broke down on a new collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p>[3]  The provision states:\n</p>\n<p>The [AAA] shall grant the Union full leave with pay to the members of the executive central committee of the Union.... The Union shall reimburse said salaries including fringe benefits.</p>\n<p>[4]  The provision states:\n</p>\n<p>The [AAA] agrees to contribute to the health insurance plan the following amounts for each Union member employee so that the employee, his spouse and dependent children under the age of 19 or, if they continue on as full-time students, up to the age of 23, may enjoy the following services: A) A family health insurance plan that includes hospitalization, surgery, and dispensary services B) a medicine payment plan, C) a dental plan, D) major medical, and E) eyeglasses.</p>\n<p>[5]  These provisions were in the collective bargaining agreement in effect at the time of the incorporation, and were carried over into the collective bargaining agreement at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p>[6]  Specifically, the bylaws provided that \"[t]he [AAA] shall send directly to the [Union] on or before the fifth (5th) day of each month the amount corresponding to the number of Union employees covered monthly by the plan as of the last day of the preceding month.\" In addition, José Nieves, the AAA's Labor Relations manager, testified that the collective bargaining agreement \"established that [the payments] would be paid to Héctor René Lugo and [the Union],\" but that the checks were \"identified for health plan.\"</p>\n<p>[7]  The checks stated, below the name of the Union as payee, \"Aportación Plan Médico,\" which was translated at trial as \"health plan contribution.\"</p>\n<p>[8]  At trial the statute was translated as \"fiduciarily responsible,\" although the official translation of the statute translates the words as \"fiducially liable.\" <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 1907 (\"Fiduciary liability[:] Any director, officer or member of a health service[ ] organization who receives, collects, disburses or invests funds related to the activities of said organization, shall be fiducially liable for the funds received from the subscribers.\").</p>\n<p>[9]  <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 1903a(2) (\"The Commissioner may examine and investigate [those organizations subject to its jurisdiction] with the purpose of determining their organization and solvency, as well as their compliance with the provisions of this Code.\"); <i>id.</i> § 1918 (setting forth required examinations of organizations subject to the OIC's oversight).</p>\n<p>[10]  <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 1905(2)(a) (\"A health services organization, before exercising... the power to contract administrative functions ... shall furnish to the Commissioner the adequate information to justify the exercise of said powers.\").</p>\n<p>[11]  The collective bargaining agreement provides:\n</p>\n<p>The stipulation between [the Union] and the AAA dated October 1, 1991 (requiring that in the event of an operational deficit in the plan due to causes not attributable to illegal appropriation, malfeasance, misuse of funds or negligence of the plan manager), the parties shall meet to analyze and resolve the deficits (shall continue in effect with that review, except for the change of the fiscal year to natural year as required by [the Union]).</p>\n<p>[12]  The checks were:\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<pre>\n  1. September 14, 2001  -$  496,157.05\n  2. September 26, 2001  -$  555,535.65\n  3. October 2, 2001     -$  261,000.00\n  4. October 3, 2001     -$1,142,199.25\n</pre>\n<p>The checks totaled $2,454,891.95.</p>\n<p>[13]  Late in 2001, however, the Defendants directly deposited more than $3M of the contributions into the Union Account without first depositing the funds into the Plan Account.\n</p>\n<p>At the same time, the Defendants began making frequent transfers from the Union Account to the so-called Cultural Trips Account, which also belonged to the Union. For the next several years, García would receive regular payments from the Cultural Trips Account. All told, she received $209,379 from the account during the period when it contained diverted Health Plan funds. Like the payments she received from the Infrastructure and Union Accounts, she did not report any of the Cultural Trips payments in her tax returns.</p>\n<p>[14]  As discussed in more detail below, the balance sheets did not reflect all funds available to the Union, such as the SINOT contributions, but it did comprise the income the Union reported that it received.</p>\n<p>[15]  The 1999 certification, for example, states:\n</p>\n<p>I certify that the Board of Directors of the UIA's Health Plan, Inc., has not officially met during the last two years. However, all of its members discuss and analyze the diversity of administrative issues of their incumbency on a daily basis. The reason for this being that the premiums of the UIA Health Plan, Inc. are paid entirely by the employer ([AAA]) and are subject to the negotiation of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.</p>\n<p>[16]  In fact, Rubén Luciano Guzmán (\"Luciano\"), the Health Plan's accountant, testified at trial that the Welfare Account effectively belonged to the Union because he never had access to it.</p>\n<p>[17]  <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 1908(2)(a) (\"Every health services organization shall register the rates to be used in any health care plan with the Commissioner before applying them in Puerto Rico.\").</p>\n<p>[18]  After challenging the finding, the Defendants would later be fined for the violation in August 2003.</p>\n<p>[19]  Luciano would testify at trial that Carrasquillo told him that he opened the Welfare Account because the OIC had fined them for sending the Plan a \"surplus\" above $222 and that he wanted \"to avoid further fines.\" Luciano further testified that he did not believe Carrasquillo because, to avoid fines, the Defendants either would have discontinued using unapproved rates or would have asked for a rate increase.</p>\n<p>[20]  In April 2004, Román retired as Union treasurer and was replaced by Víctor Cornier (\"Cornier\"). Román proceeded to receive $30,000 from the Infrastructure, Union, and Administrative Accounts as an \"[e]xtraordinary bonus for [his] years of service,\" although the maximum bonus authorized by the constitution was $1,000.</p>\n<p>[21]  This excluded the amounts that García had received from the Cultural Trips Account.</p>\n<p>[22]  The indictment also contained two forfeiture counts, Counts 141-42, that were later dismissed by the district court and are not at issue on appeal.</p>\n<p>[23]  For example, Counts 2-13 charged Lugo with embezzlement of \"assets of the [Health Plan], a health care benefit program, as defined in Title 18, United States Code, Section 24,\" and listed twelve checks, including dates, check numbers, amounts, and the account the check came from (Infrastructure, Union, or Administration). The Counts were allocated as follows:\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<pre>\nCarrasquillo        Counts 14-25\nGarcía              Counts 26-36\nRomán               Counts 37-48\nCaraballo           Counts 49-60\nAndino              Counts 61-72\nMartínez            Counts 73-84\nRamos               Counts 85-96\nVázquez             Counts 97-108\nUrbina              Counts 109-120\nRoldán       Counts 121-132\n</pre>\n<p>[24]  Of particular note, Counts 137 and 138 charged Lugo and Román with misapplying funds from the Old Health Plan (specifically, checks of $1,000 and $43,063) to purchase a \"2003 Jaguar X-Type ... for the personal use of defendant Lugo.\"</p>\n<p>[25]  Lugo separately argues that 18 U.S.C. § 669 is \"void for vagueness\" since it \"d[oes] not make ... reasonably clear that the compensation [he] received\" was prohibited. Lugo claims that the Union's constitution, its collective bargaining agreement, and the Plan's bylaws all failed to give him \"fair warning\" that he could not take the payments that he did. His claim, however, is better understood as a <i>sufficiency</i> claim as to whether his conduct was \"knowing and willing.\" We discuss that sufficiency claim in more detail below.</p>\n<p>[26]  The Defendants, in supplemental briefing, concede that their argument as to the character of the funds does not apply to Count 1, the conspiracy to embezzle count, and Count 140, the money laundering count.</p>\n<p>[27]  The Defendants do not dispute that the Health Plan is a \"health care benefit program\" under § 669, which is defined broadly as:\n</p>\n<p>[A]ny public or private plan or contract, affecting commerce, under which any medical benefit, item, or service is provided to any individual, and includes any individual or entity who is providing a medical benefit, item, or service for which payment may be made under the plan or contract.</p>\n<p>18 U.S.C. § 24(b) (defining a \"health care benefit program\" for purposes of § 669). The definition applies with equal force to the Old Health Plan, and thus to the misapplication counts (Counts 133-39) involving those funds. Accordingly, we reject Lugo and Román's contention otherwise.</p>\n<p>[28]  18 U.S.C. § 641 provides, in pertinent part:\n</p>\n<p>Whoever embezzles, steals, purloins, or knowingly converts to his use or the use of another, or without authority, sells, conveys or disposes of any record, voucher, money, or thing of value of the United States or of any department or agency thereof, or any property made or being made under contract for the United States or any department or agency thereof;</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both; but if the value of such property in the aggregate, combining amounts from all the counts for which the defendant is convicted in a single case, does not exceed the sum of $1,000, he shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.</p>\n<p>[29]  At least one circuit has noted that Section 669, and HIPAA generally, were \"broad measures Congress enacted in its effort to `combat waste, fraud, and abuse in health insurance and health care delivery.'\" <i>Whited,</i> 311 F.3d at 268 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>[30]  These secondary sources do not cite any legislative history for this proposition, nor do the parties cite any.</p>\n<p>[31]  We note that <i>Jackson</i> differs from this case in two material respects. First, <i>Jackson</i> concerned whether a bare contractual obligation that had become due could be considered an \"asset\" for purposes of the ERISA theft statute. <i>See </i><i>Jackson,</i> 524 F.3d at 544. In contrast, the funds here were not just contractual obligations, but <i>actual checks</i> that, on their face, were made out for <i>the specific purpose</i> of funding the Health Plan. Thus, at issue here are not contractual obligations but actual property. Second, the employer in <i>Jackson</i> owed no fiduciary duty to the beneficiaries of the unpaid contributions. <i>See id.</i> at 545 (rejecting claim that unpaid contributions were assets of the Plan because the defendant employers \"were never fiduciaries of the Plan[]\"). In contrast, upon receiving the checks, the Defendants in this case had a fiduciary duty to the Health Plan insofar as they were simultaneously on the Plan's board.\n</p>\n<p>We further note that the Defendants' position has absurd consequences. Indeed, at oral argument, one judge on this panel noted that, under the Defendants' position, the Defendants could not be convicted under § 669 if they had never deposited the Health Plan contributions into the Plan Account <i>at all,</i> and just immediately deposited the contributions into the Defendants' personal bank accounts. Defense counsel responded that \"it does not seem that I am arguing that.\"</p>\n<p>[32]  In fact, as noted in the background section above, from 1998 to 2001 the total amount actually <i>paid</i> to the Defendants was similar in amount (or exceeded) the total amount of reported income for the Union.</p>\n<p>[33]  Like the Health Plan contributions at issue in this appeal, the Defendants were similarly constrained in their use of these other funds. In addition, the funds were similarly not reported in the Union's balance sheets. In essence, the Defendants argue that their convictions cannot stand because they were guilty of embezzling different funds.</p>\n<p>[34]  For example, one might funnel small values of embezzled funds through an account that contains mostly non-embezzled funds, such that embezzled funds never comprise a substantial portion of that account. Although we conclude in this case that the Infrastructure Account <i>did</i> contain mostly Health Plan funds, as a hypothetical matter, we find it difficult to believe that a defendant could avoid liability through such a scheme.</p>\n<p>[35]  The Defendants do not present this challenge as a separate basis for reversal, but as part and parcel of their claim that the evidence establishing their lack of authority was insufficient.</p>\n<p>[36]  It is unclear whether the Defendants challenged the willful blindness instruction as a separate ground for reversal. To the extent that they did, any such error was harmless because, as discussed below, the evidence was sufficient to support their direct knowledge of the scheme.</p>\n<p>[37]  We note that none of the challenges here involve a claim of structural error, which would not require a showing of prejudice. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Brandao,</i> 539 F.3d 44, 58 (1st Cir.2008) (defining structural errors as \"constitutional errors that deprive the defendant of a fundamentally fair trial and thus may not be found harmless under Rule 52(a)'s harmless error standard\").</p>\n<p>[38]  García and Vázquez argue that the government argued in closing that commingling itself \"made the receipt of all compensation by [the defendants] illegal.\" However, they cite no transcript page for that claim, and we cannot find any record of it.</p>\n\n</div>",

Dramatis Personae</h2>\n<p>There are eleven appellant-defendants in this consolidated appeal (together, the \"Defendants\"). They are:</p>\n<blockquote>(1) Héctor René Lugo-Ríos (\"Lugo\")</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) Andrés Carrasquillo-Colón (\"Carrasquillo\")</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(3) Elba García-Pastrana (\"García\")</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(4) Felipe Román-Lozada (\"Román\")</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(5) Jesús Caraballo-Ortiz (\"Caraballo\")</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(6) Luis Andino-Delbrey (\"Andino\")</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(7) Francisco Martínez-Irizarry (\"Martínez\")</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(8) Juan Ramos-Hernández (\"Ramos\")</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(9) Enrique Vázquez-Préstamo (\"Vázquez\")</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(10) Jorge L. Urbina-Acevedo (\"Urbina\")</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(11) Juan Roldán-Vega (\"Roldán\")</blockquote>\n<p>The Defendants were non-management, \"regular\" employees of AAA, a public utility company providing water and sewer services to Puerto Rico's residents. Each defendant was also a member of the Union, which represented AAA's non-management employees. Management employees of AAA were members of a different union, called Hermandad Independiente Empleados Profesionales de la AAA (\"HIEPPA\").</p>\n<p>At all times relevant to this appeal, the Union had approximately 4,500 total members, and each member paid $7 per month in membership dues. The Union had other funds. Apart from the health plan contributions at issue in this appeal, the Union also received (1) monthly contributions to \"a temporary disability insurance\" program known as the \"SINOT and Uniform Benefits program\" (hereinafter \"SINOT\");<sup>[1]</sup> (2) monthly contributions to an <span class=\"star-pagination\">*359</span> employee savings and retirement program; and (3) money received by the Union for renting out a parking lot.</p>\n<p>The Union's composition, activities, and finances were governed by two documents: (1) a constitution and (2) a collective bargaining agreement with the AAA.<sup>[2]</sup> The Union's constitution established a Central Executive Committee (\"CEC\") responsible for the Union's finances and day-to-day administration. The CEC consisted of a president, vice president, executive secretary, and treasurer, as well as a single representative from each of the Union's seven local chapters. At all times relevant to this appeal, Lugo, Carrasquillo, García, and Román served as the president, vice president, executive secretary, and treasurer, respectively, of the CEC (together, the \"Top Four Defendants\"). At all times relevant to this appeal, Caraballo, Andino, Martínez, Ramos, Vázquez, Urbina, and Roldán were presidents of the Union's seven local chapters (together, the \"Chapter Presidents\").</p>\n<p>The Union did not provide a salary for CEC officers. Instead, the officers were paid under a labor leave with pay provision in the collective bargaining agreement. Under that \"labor leave\" provision, also referred to as a \"labor license,\" the AAA paid the officers their full salaries, but excused the officers from their AAA jobs to work full time for the Union.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Under the collective-bargaining agreement, the AAA agreed to contribute a fixed amount per month to a \"health insurance plan\" for every Union member.<sup>[4]</sup> At all times relevant to this appeal, the monthly contributions ranged from $232 to $355 per member.</p>\n<p>Until 1993, the Union used the AAA's contributions to administer a health plan called Plan de Salud UIA (the \"Old Health Plan\"). The Old Health Plan was not incorporated as a \"health service organization\" and thus was not subject to the jurisdiction of Puerto Rico's Office of the Insurance Commissioner (the \"OIC\").</p>\n<p>In late 1993, the CEC incorporated the Union-operated plan as a health service organization, Plan de Salud UIA (the \"Health Plan\" or \"Plan\"). Defendants Lugo, Carrasquillo, García, and Román filed paperwork certifying that the Union would administer the AAA's medical contributions \"in compliance with\" and otherwise be subject to \"the Puerto Rico Insurance Code.\" In incorporating the Health Plan, the Union complied with provisions of the collective bargaining agreement that required that \"[t]he Union ... contract the services of a medical plan that is authorized by the [OIC]\" and that \"the medical plan fully compl[y] with all the requirements imposed by the [OIC].\"<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*360</span> The Health Plan's bylaws provided that the Health Plan was a \"non-profit corporation with the fundamental purpose of providing health care services to the employees of [the AAA] who are members of the [Union].\" They further stated that \"[t]he principal source of financing of [the Health Plan] shall be the contributions negotiated by means of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, to be made by the [AAA].\" Under the collective bargaining agreement, the AAA would disburse each monthly Health Plan contribution to the Union via a check in the Union's name.<sup>[6]</sup> Although the funds were not directly sent to the Health Plan, the AAA's monthly checks stated on their face that they were \"health plan contribution[s],\"<sup>[7]</sup> and the collective bargaining agreement further provided that AAA \"agree[d] to contribute <i>to the medical plan</i> the following amounts for each employee.\" (Emphasis added). In addition, the collective bargaining agreement did not specifically provide that the funds belonged to the Union or that the Union could keep any surplus should it contract with a medical plan for less than the AAA contribution amount.</p>\n<p>The Health Plan's bylaws further established a board of directors consisting of eleven members, four of whom would serve on an Executive Committee composed of a president, vice president, executive secretary, and treasurer, with nearly identical duties to their Union counterparts. Like the Union's constitution, the Plan's bylaws did not provide the board members with a salary. As provided by the Puerto Rico Insurance Code, the Plan's board of directors would be \"fiduciarily responsible\" for funds received on behalf of the Plan's subscribers.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>In 1995, after the Health Plan was incorporated, the eleven defendants and four other individuals met at Union headquarters to elect a board for the Health Plan. Lugo, Carrasquillo, García, and Román were chosen for the Executive Committee; they would serve as president, vice president, executive secretary, and treasurer, respectively. The other seven defendants were chosen for the other seven slots; they would serve as Health Plan \"delegates\" for their respective Union chapters. Thus, at the times relevant to this case, all eleven defendants simultaneously served as members of the Union's CEC and as members of the Health Plan's board.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. 1998 to 2001 Conduct</h2>\n<p>The Top Four Defendants controlled two Union bank accounts of significance to this appeal: (1) the Infrastructure Account and (2) the Union Account. The Top Four Defendants, in their capacity as the Plan's executive committee, also controlled the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*361</span> Health Plan's bank account (the \"Plan Account\"), which belonged directly to the Health Plan.</p>\n<p>From 1998 through most of 2001, the evidence showed that, upon receipt of the monthly \"medical plan contributions\" from the AAA, Lugo and Román would generally engage in the following transactions:</p>\n<blockquote>1. Lugo and Román would first deposit all of the AAA's Health Plan contributions directly into the Plan Account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>2. After the first transfer was complete, Lugo and Román would then transfer some of that money from the Plan Account into the Infrastructure Account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>3. They would then transfer some of the money from the Infrastructure Account to the Union Account, which is where the Union's membership dues were deposited.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>4. Finally, they would pay themselves and the other Defendants from both the Infrastructure and Union Accounts, via regular checks subsequently cashed or deposited into each of the Defendant's personal bank accounts.</blockquote>\n<p>In 2000, the OIC, using its broad investigatory authority,<sup>[9]</sup> audited the Health Plan. During the audit of the transfers from the Plan Account to the Infrastructure Account, the OIC discovered that the transfers amounted to six percent of the AAA's monthly contributions, and that the Union was charging the Plan that amount for \"administrative services.\" Because there was no contract or other documentation to support the six-percent payments, the OIC concluded that the Health Plan had violated the Insurance Code, which required a health service organization to file a formal request before delegating administrative functions to another entity.<sup>[10]</sup> Moreover, the OIC requested additional information concerning the breakdown of the \"administrative services\" charged to the Health Plan. Lugo responded in an August 2001 letter that the charge covered such things as \"computer systems,\" \"equipment,\" \"building,\" and \"human resources\" needed to administer and operate the Health Plan. The OIC kept its investigation open.</p>\n<p>During this time, the Health Plan had negative cash flow, such that, by the latter part of 2001, the Health Plan could not cover its expenses. Under the collective bargaining agreement, the AAA agreed to assist the Plan in resolving any \"deficit\" in its finances, subject to an audit, so long as it was not caused by \"illegal appropriation, malfeasance, misuse of funds or negligence.\"<sup>[11]</sup> Upon learning of the Health Plan debt, AAA reviewed records provided by the Health Plan to confirm the impairment, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*362</span> but did not conduct a full third party audit. The records submitted for review did not reflect the payments made to the Defendants, because those payments were made from the Infrastructure and Union Accounts using money transferred out of the Plan Account. Finding no problems in the Health Plan books provided by the Defendants, on September 9, 2001, the AAA provided the Health Plan a check for $2,781,146 payable to the Union. The Defendants deposited the money in the Union Account. In the weeks that followed, the Defendants wrote four separate checks from the Union Account to the Health Plan. The checks totaled around $2.5M, less than the approximately $2.7M paid by the AAA to the Union to cover the Health Plan's impairment.<sup>[12]</sup> The difference remained in the Union Account.</p>\n<p>Throughout the 1998 to 2001 period, the AAA's monthly medical contributions were $232 per Union member. With few exceptions, the Defendants deposited the full $232 into the Health Plan's account prior to reallocating the money into other accounts.<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p>Also during this time, the Defendants personally received a substantial portion of the funds contained in the Infrastructure and Union Accounts as compared to the Union's total income.</p>\n<p></p>\n<pre>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                       Total Income\n            Total         Total           Combined     as Reported\n            Payments      Payments        Total        on Union\n            to            to Defendants   Paid to      Balance Sheet\n            Defendants    from            Defendants   (not including\n            from Union    Infrastructure  from Both    Health Plan\nYear        Account       Account         Accounts     contributions)<sup>[14]</sup>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1998        $319,742      $346,345         $666,087      $746,804\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1999        $405,256      $352,285         $757,541      $690,357\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2000        $348,910      $402,784         $751,694      $835,469\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n</pre>\n<p>In total, from 1998 through 2001 the Defendants received $3 million from the Infrastructure and Union Accounts, with an average of about $70,000 per Defendant per year. The amounts dwarf the amount reported by the Defendants on their annual income tax statement for those years, ranging from $25,609 (Urbina, 1999) to $46,048 (García, 2001). Moreover, despite receiving these payments, the Defendants <span class=\"star-pagination\">*363</span> were not listed on the Health Plan's payroll or the Plan's tax returns.</p>\n<p>Throughout this time period, García, in her role as executive secretary, certified to the OIC that all of the members of the Health Plan's board, which consisted of the eleven Defendants, fully discussed the full gamut of the Plan's business on a frequent basis.<sup>[15]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. 2002 to 2003 Conduct</h2>\n<p>The landscape altered dramatically in the beginning of 2002.</p>\n<p>In early 2002, the OIC continued its investigation into the \"administrative services\" the Defendants charged the Health Plan. In January 2002, Lugo sent the OIC a letter attaching what he claimed was the \"contract\" under which the Defendants provided such administrative services for the Health Plan. The contract had only been signed a week earlier by Lugo and José Sánchez Gastaltierri (\"Sánchez\"), the Health Plan's administrator. Sánchez would later testify at trial that García had given him the contract to sign, and he had signed it that same day or the day afterward without analyzing it. He further testified that he only signed it because he \"understood that to be a requirement\" of his job as a \"consultant\" to Lugo and the Health Plan.</p>\n<p>Still in early 2002, a \"me-too\" clause in the collective bargaining agreement required AAA to contribute the same amount of funds for health care for Union members as for members of HIEPPA. Accordingly, beginning in February 2002, the AAA began to contribute $355 monthly to the Health Plan for each Union member.</p>\n<p>Also beginning in February 2002, the Defendants opened a new banking account, known as the Welfare Account, which did not appear in either the Union's or the Health Plan's records.<sup>[16]</sup> The opening of the Welfare Account came hot on the heels of a Report of Examination issued by the OIC on December 17, 2001, which found that the Health Plan violated the Insurance Code<sup>[17]</sup> by charging the AAA a higher rate than was approved by the OIC.<sup>[18]</sup> In fact, the Health Plan had not sought approval for its rate since 1994, when the OIC approved a rate of $222 per subscriber.</p>\n<p>Thus, purportedly to avoid any fines for charging unapproved rates,<sup>[19]</sup> the Defendants <span class=\"star-pagination\">*364</span> went against their prior practice and began to deposit the full $355 per member contribution into the Welfare Account, and later would transfer a substantial portion of the contribution into the Health Plan. The remaining amount would be transferred through different Union-controlled accounts to pay the Defendants and to finance Union activities. In 2002, the AAA's $355 monthly contributions per member totaled more than $20.3 million. However, only $16.3 million of that amount ultimately reached the Health Plan.</p>\n<p>The Health Plan subsequently faced another impairment. This time, the Defendants decided that, to cover the debt, the Health Plan would seek a series of loans from the Union, which would require the Plan to obtain OIC approval of the loans. The Plan sent the OIC the requisite paperwork, which was certified by García and Román. Luciano testified that, at the time the loans were made, he \"did not believe that the [U]nion had that kind of money to lend ... out,\" given how minimal its income was in comparison with the Plan's. He further testified that when he aired his concerns, he was later fired, he believed in part because of these \"differences.\" The OIC ultimately approved the loans based on the Defendants' representations.</p>\n<p>The Union made four loans to the Health Plan in 2002 and 2003, totaling about $3.9 million. The Defendants disbursed each of the four loan checks from the Union Account into the Plan Account. However, shortly after writing each loan check the Defendants would write another check in the same amount from the Welfare Account to the Union Account, sometimes on the same day (as shown below):</p>\n<p></p>\n<pre>\n4/16/02     Union Account     →    Health Plan      $  600,057\n4/30/02     Welfare Account        Union Account    $  600,057\n4/9/03      Union Account     →    Health Plan      $1,790,000\n4/9/03      Welfare Account        Union Account    $1,790,000\n8/21/03     Union Account     →    Health Plan      $  183,245\n8/21/03     Welfare Account        Union Account    $  183,245\n9/11/03     Union Account     →    Health Plan      $1,391,630\n9/11/03     Welfare Account        Union Account    $1,391,630\n</pre>\n<p>Because the Welfare Account was funded with money intended for the Health Plan, essentially the Union was loaning the Health Plan its <i>own</i> funds. The OIC would later discover that the Health Plan was loaning itself its own money and order the loans annulled.</p>\n<p>In 2003, the Defendants opened yet another Union bank account, the Administration Account. They deposited into that account the remaining funds from the Old Health Plan, funds that had never been transferred to the new Plan when it was first incorporated. As with the Infrastructure and Union Accounts, the Defendants also diverted funds to themselves from the Administration Account.</p>\n<p>Throughout the course of 2002 and 2003, the Defendants, particularly Lugo, Carasquillo, and García, remained in contact with the OIC concerning the purported administrative services contract. Aurea López, the OIC's chief investigator, testified at length concerning irregularities in the contract, including but not limited to: (1) the Health Plan, rather than seek approval from the OIC before delegating functions to the Union, submitted an already-executed contract; (2) the contract lacked any specificity; (3) the Defendants' responses to OIC questions concerning what the contract covered were vague; (3) Lugo's attempt to clarify the contract in one instance actually added terms (such as property damage insurance) that were not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*365</span> in the contract; (4) the Union was overcharging the Plan, paying more than $2.2 million more than fair market value for the services the Union provided; (5) neither the Union nor the Plan passed a corporate resolution authorizing the contract; and (6) the contract stated that Sánchez had \"complete authority\" to sign it on the Plan's behalf, when there was no evidence that he had such authority.</p>\n<p>From 2002 through 2003, the Defendants paid themselves a total of more than $1,700,000 from the Infrastructure, Union, and Administration Accounts. Again, none of the Defendants reported this income in their tax returns, despite the fact that the income overwhelmed the amount of money they actually reported. Moreover, the Health Plan's tax returns, which again Lugo signed, did not list the Defendants on the payroll. Finally, from 2002 through 2003, the Defendants were purportedly meeting regularly \"every day,\" eating lunch together in the Union's cafeteria (and charging the meals to the Infrastructure Account to boot).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. 2004 to 2006 Conduct</h2>\n<p>In January 2004, the OIC formally rejected the purported administrative services contract that had been submitted by the Union, concluding that it \"substantially affect[ed] the financial situation\" of the Health Plan. The OIC cited contractual irregularities and lack of control it allowed the Health Plan over its <i>own</i> finances as reasons for disallowing the arrangement. The OIC also requested information from Carrasquillo about the Infrastructure and Union Accounts, such as who was paid from them, how much, and for what services. Carrasquillo was less than forthcoming. He responded that the Defendants were paid from the Infrastructure Account for spending \"50 to 60 percent of the[ir] time\" on Health Plan matters, and that he could provide further details but the books were behind. As for the Union Account, Carrasquillo stated that any inquiry into it was \"not appropriate\" and \"unrelated\" to the Health Plan. Despite the OIC's rejection of the contract, the Defendants continued to transfer the Plan's funds as though the contract was still in effect.<sup>[20]</sup></p>\n<p>In May 2004, the OIC made public much of what it had learned about the Health Plan during its investigation. The Defendants were subsequently ordered to transfer the $7.4M that remained in the Welfare Account to the Health Plan. After learning of the OIC's findings, the AAA stopped making monthly contributions to the Union for Health Plan purposes, and instead began to deposit contribution payments directly into the Plan Account. In August 2004, the AAA stopped contributing to the Health Plan entirely. It also ceased paying the Defendants under the labor leave provisions of the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p>Shortly thereafter, in September 2004, all eleven Defendants filed amended tax returns for every year from 1998 through 2003, reporting purported \"income\" that they had not reported earlier. In a creative stroke, the Defendants listed the previously unreported income as \"payments received for professions and commissions\" without listing what those \"professions\" or \"commissions\" were.</p>\n<p>In October 2004, the Union began a twelve week strike. While on strike, the Union members, including the Defendants, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*366</span> were not entitled to any salary or benefits from the AAA. Instead, the Union itself would pay each member $300 every two weeks for participating in strike activities, for a maximum of up to $1,800. During the strike, however, all of the Defendants received payments from the Infrastructure and Union Accounts. Many of these payments were treated as reimbursement expenses although the Defendants had no supporting documentation.</p>\n<p>Including these final payments during the strike, the Defendants received a total of more than $5.8M from the Infrastructure, Union, and Administration Accounts from 1998 through 2004. The individual Defendants' totals were as follows:</p>\n<p></p>\n<pre>\nLugo                   $1,757,164\nCarrasquillo           $  948,166\nGarcía                $  540,127<sup>[21]</sup>\nRomán                 $  868,421\nCaraballo              $  287,204\nAndino                 $  282,086\nMartínez              $  247,897\nRamos                  $  234,714\nVázquez               $  247,075\nUrbina                 $  194,729\nRoldán                $  203,827\n</pre>\n<p>In late October 2004, federal agents executed a search warrant at the Union's headquarters, which also housed the Health Plan's offices. Agents seized from Lugo's office nearly $40,000 in cash, along with ten uncashed checks from the Infrastructure Account and incomplete Health Plan board meeting minutes.</p>\n<p>In 2005, a grand jury issued a subpoena to the Health Plan's custodian of records, seeking the complete minute book for the Plan's board meetings. García, the Health Plan's custodian, declined to produce the book, claiming that it was seized during the search. In early 2006, just months before trial, García gave the minute book to her successor as the Health Plan's executive secretary, Enrique Dávila Vargas (\"Dávila\"), which later was obtained by the government during trial. The book contained additional meeting minutes that were not included in the documents seized by the government.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. The Proceedings</h2>\n<p>The Defendants were charged in a 140-count indictment.<sup>[22]</sup> Count 1 charged all Defendants with a conspiracy to violate 18 U.S.C. § 669, which prohibits the embezzlement or misapplication of funds of a \"health care benefit program.\" Counts 2 through 132 each charged an individual Defendant with receipt of a check from a Union bank account (<i>e.g.,</i> the Infrastructure Account, the Union Account) that the government alleged constituted substantive embezzlement of Health Plan funds in violation of § 669.<sup>[23]</sup> Counts 133-39 charged Román and Lugo jointly with misapplication of funds in violation 18 U.S.C. § 669, specifically funds concerning the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*367</span> Old Health Plan.<sup>[24]</sup> Finally, Count 140 charged all of the Defendants with a conspiracy to commit money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(A)(i), § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i), &amp; § 1956(h).</p>\n<p>The case proceeded to trial, which commenced on May 2, 2006. At trial, a number of witnesses testified for the government: Nieves; López; Luciano; Sánchez; Cornier; Dávila; Jennifer Griffen, an FBI financial analyst who was involved in the October 2004 search and who testified to the payments to the Defendants from the Union, Infrastructure, and Administrative Accounts; Clotilde Díaz (\"Díaz\"), who ran the Union cafeteria; and Gerald LaPorte, an expert on ink analysis of documents. The Defendants countered with, among other things, the testimony of Lemuel Toledo (\"Toledo\"), a certified insurance counselor who testified as to the reasonableness of the rate charged under the administrative services contract and Manuel Villalón, a tax attorney and CPA who advised the Defendants.</p>\n<p>Of significance to this appeal, the government gave the minute book it obtained from Dávila to LaPorte to be examined. At trial, LaPorte testified that the minutes dating from 1995-2003, including all meetings relating to the Health Plan loans, were likely not authored on the dates presented. In fact, he testified that the evidence \"strongly support[ed]\" the conclusion that the minutes in question, including the loan minutes, were all created at the same time, rather than over the course of eight years.</p>\n<p>In June 2006, following a seven-week jury trial, all of the Defendants except Carrasquillo were convicted of all charges they faced. In September 2006, following a separate three-week jury trial, Carrasquillo, who was tried separately due to illness, was likewise convicted of all charges that pertained to him. In December 2006 and February 2007, the Defendants were sentenced, with the respective sentences ranging from twelve months and a day (Caraballo, Andino, and Urbina) to 210 months (Lugo).</p>\n<p>The Defendants now appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Sufficiency of Evidence</h2>\n<p>The Defendants raise a number of issues concerning the sufficiency of the evidence in support of their convictions. \"We review a sufficiency claim de novo, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict to determine whether a rational jury could find each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>United States v. Scott,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203780\"><a href=\"/opinion/203780/united-states-v-scott/\"><span class=\"volume\">564</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 39 (1st Cir.2009) (citing <i>United States v.

In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, \"[w]e do not `weigh evidence or make credibility judgments.'\" <i>United States v. Bristol-Mártir,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">570</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></span>, 38 (1st Cir. 2009) (quoting <i>United States v.

Moreover, we \"`must uphold any verdict that is supported by a plausible rendition of the record.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 38 (quoting <i>Ofray-Campos,</i> 534 F.3d at 32).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>The Embezzlement Convictions</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The Defendants contend that the evidence is insufficient to support their convictions for embezzlement. Each was convicted under Count I of conspiring to embezzle Health Plan funds pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 669 and 18 U.S.C. § 371. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*368</span> The Defendants were also convicted of separate counts of substantive embezzlement under § 669 based on payments they received from either the Union, Infrastructure, or Administrative Accounts.</p>\n<p>18 U.S.C. § 669, the basis of the embezzlement convictions, provides:</p>\n<blockquote>Whoever knowingly and willfully embezzles, steals, or otherwise without authority converts to the use of any person other than the rightful owner, or intentionally misapplies any of the moneys, funds, securities, premiums, credits, property, or other assets of a health care benefit program, shall be fined ... or imprisoned ... or both ....</blockquote>\n<p>18 U.S.C. § 669(a). Section 669 \"remains largely untested and unanalyzed.\" Robert Fabrikant et al., Health Care Fraud § 2.02[5], at 2-34 (2009).<sup>[25]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. \"funds ... of a health care benefit program\"</h2>\n<p>The Defendants first contend that there is insufficient evidence to establish that the transactions at issue in support of Counts 2 through 139 involved \"funds ... of a health care benefit program.\"<sup>[26]</sup> 18 U.S.C. § 669. They argue that, because the Defendants commingled Health Plan funds with other funds within the custody of the Union, there is insufficient evidence to establish that the Defendants embezzled Health Plan funds as opposed to other Union funds.</p>\n<p>A first reason for rejecting this contention is that the defendants effectively admitted in their testimony and their arguments to the jury that the moneys they took were essentially payments to them by the Health Plan for services they rendered to it. It was the Defendants' position throughout trial that as officials of the Health Plan, they rendered numerous administrative and executive services to it for which they were entitled to compensation, and that moneys which are the basis of the allegations of the embezzlement were not embezzled at all but were rather taken by them as the Health Plan's proper compensation to them for the services they rendered. Their contention that there was insufficient evidence to prove that the funds were Health Plan moneys is contradicted by their own assertions that these were Health Plan moneys.</p>\n<p>Even without these admissions, we would reject the Defendants' contention. As a threshold matter, the parties dispute what § 669 requires the government to show in order to prove that the purportedly embezzled funds were \"funds ... of a health care benefit plan.\"<sup>[27]</sup> The language <span class=\"star-pagination\">*369</span> of the statute does not provide any guidance, and the few cases that have concerned convictions under § 669 have not addressed the government's burden in proving that embezzled funds are \"funds... of a health care benefit program.\" <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Whited,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779919\"><a href=\"/opinion/779919/united-states-v-ruth-whited/\"><span class=\"volume\">311</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">259</span></a></span> (3d Cir.2002) (addressing sufficiency of the indictment, meaning of \"health care benefit program,\" and Commerce Clause challenges to § 669); <i>United States v. Jackson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1025592\"><a href=\"/opinion/1025592/united-states-v-jackson/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">532</span></a></span>, 534 (4th Cir. 2008), <i>vacated on other grounds,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></span> (2009) (mentioning, without discussing, conviction under § 669).</p>\n<p>The Defendants point out that, in enacting § 669, Congress did not adopt the approach of other federal statutes that relieve the government of proving the character of the funds embezzled. By way of contrast, the Defendants cite 18 U.S.C. § 666, which prohibits the \"embezzle[ment]\" of funds \"owned by, or ... under the care, custody, or control of [an] organization, government, or agency,\" so long as the organization received \"in any one year period, benefits in excess of $10,000 under a Federal program.\" 18 U.S.C. § 666(a) &amp; (b). By its terms, § 666 does not require the government to prove that the funds purportedly embezzled are, in fact, those funds provided by the \"Federal program\" as opposed to other funds. In fact, the legislative history of § 666 shows that it was enacted precisely to deal with the difficulty of proving the \"federal character\" of funds under the general federal fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. § 641.<sup>[28]</sup><i>See</i> S.Rep. No. 98-225, at 369 (1985), <i>reprinted in</i> 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3510 (noting that § 641 required the government to show \"that the property stolen is property of the United States,\" which was \"impossible\" in many cases where \"the funds are so commingled that the federal character of the funds [could] not be shown\").</p>\n<p>By contrast, the Defendants argue that § 669 provides no such language. In fact, in enacting § 669 as part of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, (\"HIPAA\"), <i>see</i> Pub.L. No. 104-191, 110 Stat. 1936 (1996),<sup>[29]</sup> Congress had the opportunity to adopt the approach taken by § 666 but chose not to. Instead, and as the government concedes, § 669 was most likely \"modeled after\" § 641. <i>See</i> Fabrikant et al., <i>supra,</i> § 3.02[13], at 3-114 to 3-115 (2007) (noting that § 669 was \"modeled after 18 U.S.C. Section 641, which makes it a crime to embezzle, steal, or convert property or a thing of value belonging to the United States\"); <i>see also</i> Diana Douglas, <i>Attorneys Caught in the Web of Medicare/Medicaid Fraud,</i> 21 J. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*370</span> Legal. Med. 395, 412 (2000) (\"Section 669 was patterned after 18 U.S.C. section 641, the federal theft and embezzlement statute, and serves as a companion to it.\").<sup>[30]</sup> Indeed, although not mirror images of each other, both set forth the character of the funds as an element of the offense.</p>\n<p>We agree with the Defendants' premise that § 641 provides the closest analogue to § 669. However, we disagree with the Defendants' conclusion that embezzled dollars cannot serve as the basis of a conviction under § 669 unless they are proven to have been the property of a health plan.</p>\n<p>Like § 669, the case law interpreting § 641 is sparse, but courts have generally not required the government to trace the dollars embezzled to a federal source. In <i>United States v. Gibbs,</i> for example, the Ninth Circuit addressed a sufficiency challenge to a § 641 conviction in the context of commingled sources of funding. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"416622\"><a href=\"/opinion/416622/united-states-v-sandy-e-gibbs/\"><span class=\"volume\">704</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">464</span></a></span> (9th Cir.1983) (per curiam). There, the defendant founded a corporation to \"promote educational opportunities for American Indians\" that \"received most of its funds from the federal government.\" <i>Id.</i> at 465. The defendant was convicted under § 641 despite the fact that the defendant \"commingled federal funds with nonfederal funds received from state and private sources.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The Ninth Circuit upheld the conviction, which involved multiple counts of substantive embezzlement where \"the amount of nonfederal funds exceeded the amounts embezzled, [such that] it is possible that the funds embezzled were entirely nonfederal.\" <i>Id.</i> at 465-66 (noting that the defendant was charged \"with thirty-four counts of embezzlement under 18 U.S.C. § 641\" and that the \"jury convicted him of twenty of the counts.\"). In doing so, the court rejected the defendant's argument that the government failed to prove \"the federal nature of the funds embezzled.\" <i>Id.</i> at 465. The court held, in particular, that the evidence was sufficient because (1) \"between 80-86% of the funds in the account from which [the defendant] embezzled was federal money\" and (2) \"the federal government monitored and controlled these funds.\" <i>Id.</i> at 466. A number of other courts have adopted the same approach. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Evans,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"354019\"><a href=\"/opinion/354019/united-states-v-cecil-dwayne-evans-arnold-gene-tate-and-charles-edward/\"><span class=\"volume\">572</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">455</span></a></span>, 474 (5th Cir.1978) (holding that the evidence sufficient to support a conviction under § 641 where more than 75 percent of the funds in the commingled account were federal and were \"subject to extensive federal controls\"); <i>United States v. Scott,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"465230\"><a href=\"/opinion/465230/united-states-v-nell-scott-united-states-of-america-v-ronald-scott/\"><span class=\"volume\">784</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">787</span></a></span>, 790-91 (7th Cir. 1986) (per curiam) (holding evidence was sufficient to support verdict under § 641 where 98% percent of the commingled funds were federal and \"the federal government still maintained supervision and control over the funds at the point when the funds were stolen.\").</p>\n<p>Our case law is not to the contrary. Defendants cite <i>United States v. Elías-Rivera,</i> where we noted that, in the bankruptcy context, there \"is an established presumption that withdrawals for other than trust purposes from an account in which trust funds are commingled with nontrust funds are presumed to be made from nontrust funds.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"506668\"><a href=\"/opinion/506668/united-states-v-johnny-elias-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">848</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 19 (1st Cir.1998). But in that case, involving a bankruptcy trustee who commingled all of the estates he supervised in one account, \"[t]he prosecution failed to prove that funds were even missing, much less missing from funds belonging to the debtors,\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*371</span> such that there was a \"total lack of evidence\" to \"rebut [the] presumption.\" <i>Id. Elías-Rivera,</i> therefore, does not speak to the situation here, which concerns what evidence is sufficient to rebut any such presumption.</p>\n<p>Comparing this case to <i>Gibbs</i> and <i>Evans,</i> it is clear that the funds embezzled were \"funds ... of a health care benefit program\" under § 669. As in those cases, (1) the \"health care benefit program\" funds were a substantial portion of the commingled funds; and (2) the \"health care benefit program\" exercised sufficient supervision and control over the funds to preserve their character.</p>\n<p>As the <i>Gibbs</i> court emphasized, \"the government's supervision and control ... is the critical factor in determining the federal character of the funds in a commingled account.\" 704 F.2d at 466. We conclude that, based on the evidence in this case, the Health Plan had sufficient supervision and control over the Health Plan contributions to establish that the funds embezzled were \"funds ... of a health care benefit program.\"</p>\n<p>As an initial matter, the Defendants argue that the relevant analogue to \"federal supervision and control\" in the § 669 context is control by the AAA. But AAA is only the <i>contributor</i> of the funds. Section 669 protects \"funds ... of a health care benefit plan,\" and thus, as in the context of § 641, the relevant entity for purposes of the \"supervision and control\" prong is the <i>protected</i> entity. Moreover, as in <i>Gibbs</i> and <i>Evans,</i> the Health Plan was both the source of the funds and the protected entity. Once the Union deposited the funds in the Plan Account, the Health Plan stood in the same position as the federal government in both providing its funds to the Union and in being the victim of the Defendants' embezzlement.</p>\n<p>The Defendants further argue that the Health Plan did not have a sufficient stake in the funds such that the funds failed to retain their \"Health Plan\" character once they were diverted out of the Health Plan Account. In <i>Evans,</i> for example, the court noted that funds in that case \"ha[d] a federal origin and a federal end, and during their outstanding circulation they [were] subject to extensive federal controls. This [was] not the situation in which the federal monies [were] intended <i>as an outright grant.</i>\" 572 F.2d at 474 (emphasis added). In particular, the <i>Evans</i> court noted that the federal government (in that case the Office of Education) had a sufficient stake in the funds it provided for a federal program; \"The federal interest ... is specifically established and preserved by the provision for termination of the program on a date certain and the requirement that the proportionate share of the balance in the special fund <i>be returned to the government.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> at 472; <i>see also id.</i> at 474 (\"It is statutorily contemplated that the ultimate repayment will be to the federal government.\").</p>\n<p>The Defendants specifically argue that, unlike in <i>Evans,</i> the AAA did not have a right to recover any excess funds. But again the correct analogue is the Health Plan, not the AAA, and the funds diverted were not meant to be, even by the Defendants' own admission, \"outright grants.\" Rather, the Defendants contend that the funds embezzled were for administrative services rendered, and certainly the Health Plan had a sufficient stake in those funds to ensure that the Plan received fair value for those services. The Defendants further argue that the collective bargaining agreement did not bar the Union from preserving any excess funds from the Health Plan. Even if that is true (which is doubtful), there were no excess funds to claim. The Health Plan throughout the time period of the embezzlement scheme <span class=\"star-pagination\">*372</span> suffered significant impairments, such that there were no excess funds that the Union could claim as its own. Thus, as in <i>Evans,</i> the Health Plan had a right to all funds diverted by the Defendants.</p>\n<p>The Defendants finally argue that, unlike in <i>Gibbs</i> and <i>Evans,</i> there was no equivalent to \"federal regulation\" that mandated oversight. But there was. As required under Puerto Rico law, the Defendants were fiduciarily responsible to the Plan and, thus, required to maintain oversight on how the funds were used. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 1907 (\"Fiduciary liability[:] Any director, officer or member of a health service[ ] organization who receives, collects, disburses or invests funds related to the activities of said organization, shall be fiducially liable for the funds received from the subscribers.\"); <i>cf. </i><i>FDIC v. Sea Pines Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"410945\"><a href=\"/opinion/410945/federal-deposit-insurance-corp-v-sea-pines-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">692</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">973</span></a></span>, 977 (4th Cir.1982) (noting that interlocking directors of two boards have a fiduciary responsibility for assets of both companies). For all of the above reasons, we conclude that the Health Plan exercised supervision and control of the funds, such that they were, in fact, Health Plan funds.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the Health Plan funds were a substantial portion of the commingled funds that the Defendants embezzled. As an initial matter, the Defendants argue that the Health Plan contributions made by AAA did not become \"funds ... of a health care benefit program\" until they were actually <i>deposited</i> in the Plan Account. They point to a concession made by the government in its brief in <i>United States v. Jackson</i><i>,</i> S.Ct. No. 08-263, where the government conceded that employer contributions to an ERISA plan \"themselves are not assets of [a] plan until the contributions are paid to the plan.\" U.S. Br. at 10 (Jan. 16, 2009); <i>see also </i><i>Jackson,</i> 524 F.3d at 543 (holding that \"unpaid employer contributions to the Company and Union Plans constituted `assets' of the Plans under 18 U.S.C. § 664,\" the ERISA theft statute).</p>\n<p>The concession, to the extent that it is relevant to this case,<sup>[31]</sup> does not assist the Defendants. With respect to the convictions occurring from 1998 to 2001, the evidence conclusively demonstrated that, save for one instance, the Union transferred the entire monthly Health Plan contributions to the Plan Account. Thus, there was no question that the funds subsequently diverted were Health Plan funds. Moreover, although, beginning in 2002, the Defendants first deposited the Health Plan in the Welfare Account, a substantial amount of the funds were then deposited into the Plan Account, such that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*373</span> any subsequent diversion of the funds from that Account were Health Plan funds.</p>\n<p>Turning to the evidence, it conclusively demonstrated that the Health Plan contributions, in the language from one defendant's brief, \"were the largest regular deposits by far.\" Based upon the balance sheets provided by the Union, for the years 1998 through 2000, the Union averaged approximately $757,543 per year in income, which translates to a monthly gross income of roughly $63,000 per month. In contrast, during that same time period, and with a contribution rate of $232 per member, the AAA contributed well over <i>$1 million</i> per month in Health Plan contributions during that time period. This percentage alone is well above the 75 to 80 percent threshold established in § 641 cases.<sup>[32]</sup> Holding the average income of the Union constant, the disparity between the Union's average monthly income as compared to the Health Plan contributions was even greater from 2002 to 2004. During this time period, the rate increased dramatically, such that the Union was receiving between $1.5 million and $2.3 million in Health Plan contributions per month from 2002 to 2004.</p>\n<p>The Defendants counter by arguing that the balance sheets failed to include SINOT, retirement, and rental income, which were also commingled with Health Plan funds.<sup>[33]</sup> However, their resort to these additional funds is unavailing. Including these amounts, the evidence showed that the Union contributed approximately $151,041 per month for SINOT and approximately $78,000 per month for the retirement program, and $4,500 per month in income from renting out a parking lot. Combined with the Union's income in dues (as reflected in the average income above), the total amount of non-Health Plan contribution income averaged approximately $300,000 per month. This, again, is only a small percentage of the millions per month the Union was receiving in Health Plan contributions, with the Health Plan contributions representing approximately 77% ($1 million out of $1.3 million total) of the total amount of commingled funds based on the lowest Health Plan contribution.</p>\n<p>The Defendants further counter by focusing on the specific <i>accounts</i> from which the Defendants paid themselves. Although, as a whole, the funds that the Union received in Health Plan contributions far outweighed the funds that the Union received from other sources, the Defendants argue that the amount of Health Plan contributions contained in the accounts vis-a-vis other funds were not proportionally high enough to support the convictions.</p>\n<p>For example, the Defendants point to the testimony of Jennifer Griffin, who did a \"deposit source\" analysis of the funds contained in the Infrastructure Account, as shown in the table below:</p>\n    1998: 69% Health Plan\n          22% SINOT\n           9% Cultural Trips Account\n    1999: 74% Health Plan\n          18% SINOT\n           8% Cultural Trips Account\n    2000: 75% Health Plan\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*374</span>\n          16% SINOT\n           5% Cultural Trips Account\n           4% Union Account\n    2001: 47% Health Plan\n          27% SINOT\n          15% Union Account\n          11% Cultural Trips Account\n    2002: 45% Union Account\n          36% Health Plan\n          16% SINOT\n           3% Cultural Trips Account\n    2003: 72% Union Account\n          15% SINOT\n           8% Cultural Trips Account\n           5% Health Plan\n    2004: 57% Investment Redemptions\n          32% Union Account\n           8% Health Plan\n           3% Welfare Account\n<p>Although for the first three years of the scheme 69 percent (1998), 74 percent (1999), and 75 percent (2000) of the funds contained in the Infrastructure Account were derived from Health Plan funds, the amounts declined in 2001 to 47 percent, and further declined to 36 percent (2002), 5 percent (2003), and 8 percent (2004). The Defendants seize on this decline to argue that, on average, the percentage of Health Plan funds contained in the Infrastructure Account was approximately 44 percent, below the 75 to 80 percent threshold articulated in some § 641 cases.</p>\n<p>The government counters that the \"deposit source\" analysis is somewhat misleading. It notes that, even in those years where the Infrastructure Account contained a small percentage of funds <i>directly</i> diverted from the Health Plan, it still received a significant percentage of funds from the Union Account, which itself contained funds from the Health Plan. In 2003, for example, and as shown by the complicated flow charts prepared by Griffin for trial, $19.4 million of the AAA's Health Plan contributions were deposited into the Union Account. From there, $14.8 million was passed into the Plan Account (via the Welfare Account), with $4.1 million remaining in the Union Account. And then from there, an additional $873,000 was transferred from the Plan Account to the Union Account, which resulted in the Union Account containing well over $5 million of the Health Plan's funds. This exceeded by several million dollars any other sources of funds contained in the Union Account. Thus, the large percentage (72 percent) of Union Account funds contained in the Infrastructure Account itself contained a large percentage of Health Plan funds, such that, combined with the 8 percent of Health Plan funds already contained in the Infrastructure Account, Health Plan funds comprised a substantial portion of the funds in the Infrastructure Account. However, the government did not establish at trial the \"true\" total percentage of Health Plan funds contained in the Infrastructure Account.</p>\n<p>As the above evidence shows, and in contrast to <i>Gibbs,</i> this case involves <i>multiple</i> accounts with commingled funds, with those accounts funneling Health Plan funds into each other. This scenario presents further opportunities for abuse.<sup>[34]</sup> However, based on our review of the specific evidence in this case, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict, we conclude that, as in <i>Gibbs</i> and <i>Evans,</i> Health Plan funds were a substantial portion <span class=\"star-pagination\">*375</span> of the funds in the commingled accounts.</p>\n<p>First, we stress again that the disparity between the Health Plan contributions as compared to the Union's other sources of funds was staggering. The Union received in the realm of 70 to 80 percent of its funds from Health Plan contributions, as compared to all other sources (including funds, such as SINOT and the funds for the retirement program, that the Union was not permitted to use as income). Moreover, and as the evidence showed, the Health Plan funds were commingled <i>among</i> the accounts from which the Defendants paid themselves, such that a rational juror could conclude that, at any given time, the Accounts contained Health Plan funds. That alone is sufficient under <i>Gibbs</i> to establish the \"substantial portion\" prong.</p>\n<p>Second, we note that the 75 to 80 percent level discussed in <i>Gibbs</i> and <i>Evans</i> is not a threshold. Indeed, the Seventh Circuit upheld a conviction under § 641 where as little as 50 percent of the commingled funds were federal. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Mitchell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"380069\"><a href=\"/opinion/380069/united-states-v-ronald-mitchell/\"><span class=\"volume\">625</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">158</span></a></span>, 161 (7th Cir. 1980) (concerning theft of check from Aid to Families with Dependent Children account containing 50 percent federal funds). Thus, almost all of the years for the Infrastructure Account contained a sufficient portion of Health Plan funds. For all of these reasons, we conclude that, as in <i>Gibbs</i> and <i>Evans,</i> the evidence is sufficient to show that the Health Plan funds were a substantial portion of the funds embezzled from the commingled sources.</p>\n<p>Based on the above, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient in this case to permit a rational jury to convict the Defendants for each of the substantive embezzlement counts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. \"without authority\"</h2>\n<p>Defendants next contend that there was insufficient evidence to prove that they were \"without authority\" to receive the Health Plan funds. The Defendants argue that they were <i>entitled</i> to additional compensation for the work they performed on behalf of the Health Plan, and that this compensation was authorized by the collective bargaining agreement, the constitution, the Plan bylaws, and \"historical practice.\"</p>\n<p>We conclude that the evidence was sufficient in this case to establish that the Defendants acted \"without authority.\" We stress at the outset that the issue is not whether the Defendants were anywhere explicitly <i>prohibited</i> from receiving payments from the Health Plan for services rendered; rather, the issue is whether they lacked the authority to do so. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Hammond,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"19561\"><a href=\"/opinion/19561/united-states-v-hammond/\"><span class=\"volume\">201</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">346</span></a></span>, 349 (5th Cir.1999) (per curiam) (although union president did not \"break any law or union rule\" in spending political funds, court affirmed conviction because a \"rational juror\" could conclude that expenditure was unauthorized). And, in this case, the Defendants lacked such authority.</p>\n<p>The Defendants first point to the purported \"administrative services\" contract they provided to OIC, but that is a nonstarter. The evidence at trial showed that the contract was replete with irregularities, overcharged for services, was created after the fact, was ultimately rejected by the OIC, and the government provided evidence that the minutes supporting the contract were forged. The Defendants claimed that the OIC \"mistakenly\" rejected the contract \"on the assumption that [the Defendants] could not receive such compensation because they were paid labor license.\" Even if true (which it is not, as detailed in the OIC rejection letter), the contract was nonetheless rejected, and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*376</span> cannot authorize the Defendants' actions in this case.</p>\n<p>The Defendants further point to a number of provisions in the Health Plan bylaws, the constitution, and the collective bargaining agreement that would permit compensation or at least not prohibit it. For example:</p>\n<blockquote>* The Health Plan bylaws establish the authority of the board of directors to \"set[] salaries of officials\";</blockquote>\n<blockquote>* The constitution states that \"the [CEC] will fix the representative expenses and the bonuses of the Union's Officers\";</blockquote>\n<blockquote>* The collective bargaining agreement puts Lugo in charge of \"managing and directing the rendering of services.\"</blockquote>\n<p>These provisions, if exercised, may have provided authority for the Defendants' compensation. But there was no evidence, such as a formal resolution, meeting minutes, or any other documentation that showed that the Defendants exercised those provisions. Thus, these provisions cannot supply the necessary authority for their actions.</p>\n<p>The Defendant next argue that, as a matter of practice, they received compensation for the services they provided for the Health Plan. They point to the testimony of Rubén Luciano, who testified that, under the Old Health Plan, \"there was always compensation paid to the Board of Directors.\" But this purported historical practice lacks any formal resolution or other authorization. Moreover, unlike the Old Health Plan, the Health Plan was subject to Puerto Rico's Insurance Code, and under the Code the Health Plan was required to seek approval from the OIC, and to \"furnish to the Commissioner the adequate information to justify the\" delegation of administrative services to the Defendants. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 1905(2)(a). The evidence showed that the Defendants failed to do so in this case, and thus they cannot resort to their historical practice as a source of authority.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Defendants challenge testimony given by Aurea López, the OIC's chief investigator into the Union's scheme, concerning the Defendants' labor license.<sup>[35]</sup> At trial, López testified to the following:</p>\n<blockquote>The reason for excluding those enjoying Union leave is that the position held by the Commissioner of Insurance is that those persons were already being compensated by AAA so that they could offer services to the Union. So we understood that it was also not correct that the [Health Plan] be charged for services that these people rendered to the [Health Plan].</blockquote>\n<p>The Defendants claim that López provided unqualified opinion testimony to the effect that the labor license prohibited the Defendants from receiving additional compensation for their work on the Health Plan. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 702 (permitting opinion testimony if \"(1) the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case\"). The Defendants point out that López was not established as an expert on the Union's activities to opine on the labor license. The government argues that, when read in context, López was only giving testimony on historical fact as to the OIC's conclusion that the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*377</span> Defendants' six percent charges for services were unreasonable in light of prevailing market rates.</p>\n<p>We need not decide the issue, because any error in admitting the testimony was harmless, because it would not have \"affected the outcome of the trial.\" <i>United States v. Dunbar,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203629\"><a href=\"/opinion/203629/united-states-v-dunbar/\"><span class=\"volume\">553</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></a></span>, 59 (1st Cir.2009)(\"`The essential inquiry in harmless error review is whether the improperly admitted evidence likely affected the outcome of the trial.'\") (quoting <i>United States v. Tom,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"782082\"><a href=\"/opinion/782082/united-states-v-luis-tom-aka-cuba/\"><span class=\"volume\">330</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, 95 (1st Cir. 2003)). As noted above, there was <i>no</i> evidence of any authorization for the payments the Defendants received. The Defendants claim prejudice because, they argue, the government relied upon López's testimony at trial in support of its theory that the Union's labor license precluded compensation for Health Plan work, and even cited it in their closing. However, the government argued below, as here, that no provision in the constitution, collective bargaining agreement, the Health Plan by-laws, or any other document provided authority for the payments. Moreover, no mention was made of López's testimony in the government's closing. Thus, for all of the above reasons, the evidence was sufficient to permit a rational jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendants acted without authority.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>c. \"knowingly and willfully\"</h2>\n<p>The Defendants finally argue with respect to the embezzlement convictions that the government had not met their burden to prove that the Defendants acted with the requisite criminal intent to be convicted of embezzlement.</p>\n<p>To establish an individual defendant's willing and knowing participation in a conspiracy as in this case, the government \"need not prove that [he] knew all the details ... or participated in all of the objectives ... of the conspiracy.\" <i>United States v. Brandon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"664045\"><a href=\"/opinion/664045/united-states-v-peter-brandon-united-states-of-america-v-charles-d/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">409</span></a></span>, 428 (1st Cir.1994). The prosecution need only \"show knowledge of the basic agreement,\" with \"an intent to commit the underlying substantive offense.\" <i>Id.</i> The requisite knowledge and intent can be proven through \"circumstantial evidence, including inferences from ... acts committed by the defendant that furthered the conspiracy's purposes.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>With respect to the Top Four Defendants, the evidence of their knowledge and willfulness with respect to the embezzlement convictions was more than sufficient. They all essentially argue that their actions were done in good faith. However, the evidence conclusively contradicts this assertion.</p>\n<p>We start with Lugo and Román. Among other things, the evidence showed that Lugo and Román, as president and treasurer of both the Union and the Health Plan, had signing authority over all of the bank accounts at issue in this case, and thus signed all of the checks and other documents authorizing the transfer of funds to and from various bank accounts. Lugo and Román also signed off on regular checks made out to themselves and the other Defendants which were deposited into personal accounts. Their consenting signatures are also on Health Plan tax returns that omitted these payments.</p>\n<p>Lugo and Román were also instrumental in the creation of the administrative services contract, under which the Union leaders paid themselves a six percent of Health Plan funds for administering the Health Plan. They also provided vague and misleading responses about the specifics of the contract during the course of the OIC's investigation. The administration contract was ultimately found to be invalid by the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*378</span> OIC after it was discovered that the fees the Union charged were substantially above market rates and concerns about the legitimacy of the arrangement were uncovered. Despite being informed of this decision, Lugo and Román continued issuing personal payments from Union controlled funds, which further showed their intent. <i>Cf. Young,</i> 955 F.2d at 103-04 (evidence sufficient to show intent to embezzle where defendant's \"falsification\" to a government agency \"reveal[ed] a consciousness of guilt\" (quotation omitted)). Thus, through all of these actions, both Lugo and Román displayed knowledge and willfulness with respect to the embezzlement scheme in this case.</p>\n<p>The same is largely true of the actions of Carrasquillo. Even though he lacked signing authority, Carrasquillo controlled the Union and Health Plan accounts after Román's retirement in April 2004. He was also consistently obstructive when the OIC made inquiries into the administrative services contract. These facts would permit a reasonable jury to conclude that Carrasquillo was knowingly involved in an embezzlement scheme.</p>\n<p>García, like Lugo and Carrasquillo, also played a significant role in the implementation of the administrative service contract. Although she insists that she was cooperative with the OIC in her investigation, which she asserts is proof that she did not have the intent to embezzle, her role in creating the administrative contract itself (and providing the forged minutes to support the contract) provides substantial evidence of her intent.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, none of the Top Four Defendants included any of the income they received as compensation from the Health Plan in their tax returns and, when confronted with evidence of their scheme, promptly reported the income, literally within days of each other. That alone is significant evidence of their knowledge and willfulness. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Fusaro,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"419138\"><a href=\"/opinion/419138/united-states-v-nunziato-fusaro-united-states-v-richard-r-saccone/\"><span class=\"volume\">708</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 21 (1st Cir.1983) (\"Fusaro's active participation in so many aspects of the scheme as well as his attempts to cover up the scheme as it unraveled, likewise, provides the basis for the inference that he acted with the requisite intent and knowledge.\").</p>\n<p>The Top Four Defendants each argue that their failure to file taxes on their Health Plan income is evidence of tax evasion, but not of embezzlement. However, as noted below, the jurors were instructed that \"the case that is before us ... has nothing to do with tax evasion,\" and jurors are presumed to follow instructions. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Bradshaw,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199842\"><a href=\"/opinion/199842/united-states-v-bradshaw/\"><span class=\"volume\">281</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">278</span></a></span>, 285 (1st Cir.2002) (\"[I]t is routinely presumed that jurors will follow curative instructions....\"). In any event, the Defendants conveniently only failed to report their <i>Health Plan</i> income, thus permitting a rational jury to conclude that the Defendants were not simply engaging in tax evasion.</p>\n<p>The issue is much closer with respect to the Chapter President Defendants. As noted below, the evidence was insufficient to support their convictions for money laundering because minutes establishing their knowledge turned out to be forged. Moreover, unlike the Top Four Defendants, the Chapter Presidents had no authority over any of the Union-controlled accounts.</p>\n<p>The government does not dispute that the Chapter President Defendants' role in the crime was more limited than that of the other Defendants, but argues that the evidence was still sufficient to establish their intent. The government primarily argues that the Defendants were willfully blind to the scheme, and points out that the district court in this case provided a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*379</span> willful blindness instruction.<sup>[36]</sup> The government points out that, despite the forged minutes, García certified to the OIC that \"all ... members\" of the Health Plan's board of directors \"discuss[ed] and analyze[d] the diversity of administrative issues of their incumbency on a daily basis.\" The government also points out that Clotilde Díaz, who ran the Union's cafeteria, testified that \"all\" the Defendants would have lunch together \"every day whenever they were there.\" The government finally points out that the Health Plan's bylaws required the Defendants to \"manage[]\" the Plan and \"oversee[] the faithful compliance with the laws and regulations applicable to the operation of\" the Health Plan, such that the jury could infer that the Chapter President Defendants knew that there was nothing that authorized them to receive payments.</p>\n<p>The Chapter President Defendants respond by pointing out that García's certification is far from credible. Moreover, Díaz's testimony, to the extent that it can be interpreted to mean that the Defendants ate lunch \"every day,\" was belied by the lunch tickets presented at trial, which only showed that they met with the Top Four Defendants infrequently, if at all.</p>\n<p>The evidence in support of willful blindness is sparse, at best. Willful blindness requires evidence that the Chapter Defendants were \"trying to deliberately avoid knowledge\" of the scheme, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Azubike,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203791\"><a href=\"/opinion/203791/united-states-v-azubike/\"><span class=\"volume\">564</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span>, 68 (1st Cir.2009), and the government can only muster a few meetings with the Top Four Defendants and some duties on the part of the Chapter President Defendants to manage the Health Plan. None of these actions conclusively show the Chapter President Defendants \"deliberately avoid[ing]\" knowledge of the embezzlement.</p>\n<p>However, like the Top Four Defendants, the Chapter President Defendants failed to report the income they received from the Health Plan in their tax returns, even though the purported Health Plan income was far greater than the other income they reported. More importantly, and also like the Top Four Defendants, they all proceeded to report their payments simultaneously at a time when the OIC was discovering the extent of the scheme. This, along with the other evidence, was sufficient for the jury to conclude by proof beyond a reasonable doubt the element of criminal intent. The Chapter President Defendants argue that they did not know that they had to report the payments and, at worst, only engaged in tax evasion. Although that is one view of their actions, the jury was permitted to conclude that the confluence of events here established their knowledge and willfulness by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Dwinells,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203026\"><a href=\"/opinion/203026/united-states-v-dwinells/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></a></span>, 74 (1st Cir.2007) (\"When the record is fairly susceptible of two competing scenarios, the choice between those scenarios ordinarily is for the jury.\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>The Money Laundering Convictions</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Defendants also challenge the sufficiency of the evidence in support of their money laundering convictions under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1956(a)(1)(A)(i), (a)(1)(B)(i), &amp; (h). 18 U.S.C. § 1956 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote>[w]hoever, knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful <span class=\"star-pagination\">*380</span> activity, conducts or attempts to conduct such a financial transaction which in fact involves the proceeds of specified unlawful activity[,] ... knowing that the transaction is designed in whole or in part ... to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds of the specified unlawful activity[,] ... shall be sentenced to a fine ... or imprisonment ... or both.</blockquote>\n<p>18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Cruzado-Laureano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201519\"><a href=\"/opinion/201519/united-states-v-cruzado-laureano/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">470</span></a></span>, 483 (1st Cir.2005) (discussing elements of money laundering).</p>\n<p>As an initial matter, the government concedes that the money laundering convictions of the Chapter President DefendantsCaraballo, Andino, Martínez, Ramos, Vázquez, Urbina, and Roldánmust be reversed for insufficient evidence, as a result of the expert testimony that the meeting minutes, upon which their knowledge of the money laundering scheme was based, were forgeries. Thus, we only address the claims of the Top Four Defendants.</p>\n<p>To recap, the money laundering convictions were based on loans provided to the Health Plan by the Union through the Welfare Account. Because the Welfare Account (which did not appear in either the Union or Health Plan books) consisted solely of Health Plan contributions, the Health Plan, in effect, was loaning money to itself. These \"fake\" loans were an attempt to launder the Plan funds for use by the Defendants, since the money paid back to the Union by the Health Plan, in the government's words, \"would look like fulfillment of a legitimate loan obligation,\" plus interest to boot. To further conceal the scheme, Lugo, Román, and García submitted paperwork to the OIC authorizing the Health Plan's administrator to seek the loans in question. The paperwork represented that the Union would be lending Union funds, which was not the case, as transaction records show that the money came from the Welfare Account. When Luciano, the Health Plan's accountant, pointed out the misrepresentation, he was fired. Moreover, the government's documents expert, LaPorte, testified that the Health Plan's minute book was doctored to reflect meetings that were never held.</p>\n<p>Román and Lugo argue that their convictions should be set aside in light of <i>United States v. Santos,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145804\"><a href=\"/opinion/145804/united-states-v-santos/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2020</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145804\"><a href=\"/opinion/145804/united-states-v-santos/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">912</span></a></span> (2008), where a plurality concluded that the term \"proceeds\" under § 1956(a)(1) means \"profits\" rather than \"receipts.\" <i>See id.</i> at 2031. There is some question whether <i>Santos</i> applies to this case. <i>Santos</i> concerned money laundering convictions based on payments to winners and employees of an illegal gambling operation, and applying the money laundering statute to such essential steps of the gambling operation raised a significant merger problem. <i>Id.</i> 2026. Such a merger problem is not present here, where the \"fake loan\" scheme was in addition to the Defendants' embezzlement scheme, was not essential to it, and was concocted after the embezzlement scheme was in effect. Moreover, there is some question as to the holding of <i>Santos,</i> since Justice Stevens, the fifth and deciding vote, suggested in concurrence that the holding may vary by offense and the legislative history. <i>See id.</i> at 2032-33; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Kratt,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1357824\"><a href=\"/opinion/1357824/united-states-v-kratt/\"><span class=\"volume\">579</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">558</span></a></span>, 562 (6th Cir.2009) (interpreting <i>Santos</i> to apply when application of § 1956 \"creates a merger problem that leads to a radical increase in the statutory maximum sentence and only when nothing in the legislative history suggests that Congress intended such an increase\"). But even if <i>Santos</i> applied, the transactions at issue clearly concerned the \"profits\" of the embezzlement <span class=\"star-pagination\">*381</span> scheme, given the large amounts of Health Plan funds diverted and the minimal expenses to do it. <i>See </i><i>Santos,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 2029 (stating that \"to establish the proceeds element under the `profits' interpretation, the prosecution needs to show only that a single instance of specified unlawful activity was profitable and gave rise to the money involved in a charged transaction\").</p>\n<p>Román and Lugo, along with the remaining Top Four Defendants Carrasquillo and García, also argue that they did not embezzle Health Plan funds at all, let alone engage in money laundering. For the reasons discussed above, we reject the claim. Lugo and Román separately argue that only a \"bumbling bunch of conspirators would conspire to hide proceeds of an activity they knew to be illegal by writing themselves checks and cashing them in their own names.\" But that is no defense. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Majors,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"74160\"><a href=\"/opinion/74160/united-states-v-majors/\"><span class=\"volume\">196</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1206</span></a></span>, 1214 (11th Cir.1999) (\"Moving money through a large number of accounts\" may suffice to prove money laundering even where the defendant \"withdr[aws] [funds from accounts] in his own name\") (citations omitted); <i>United States v. Sutera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"561338\"><a href=\"/opinion/561338/united-states-v-james-sutera/\"><span class=\"volume\">933</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">641</span></a></span>, 648 (8th Cir.1991) (\"[T]he money laundering statute does not require the jury to find that [the defendant] did a good job laundering the proceeds.\"). Carrasquillo argues that he opened the Welfare Account to avoid fines for depositing unapproved rates. His actions betray this excuse, as Carrasquillo could have simply asked for an approved rate, the Defendants continued to use unapproved rates after establishment of the Welfare Account, and the Union was fined anyway. Thus, a rational jury could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that Carrasquillo created this excuse to conceal the loan scheme. We thus conclude that the evidence was more than sufficient to support the money laundering convictions with respect to the Top Four Defendants.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Jury Instructions</h2>\n<p>Defendants also challenge several jury instructions provided at trial. As we have previously stated,</p>\n<blockquote>We review a properly preserved objection to \"the form and wording\" of an instruction given by the district court for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v.

A trial court's refusal to give a particular instruction is reversible error only in the \"relatively rare case\" in which \"the requested instruction was (1) substantively correct; (2) not substantially covered elsewhere in the charge; and (3) concerned a sufficiently important point that the failure to give it seriously impaired the defendant's ability to present his or her defense.\" <i>United States v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">370</span></a></span> (1999).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Embezzlement Instruction</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The Defendants first challenge certain portions of the district court's \"legal background\" as part of the court's instruction concerning 18 U.S.C. § 669. They do not challenge the instructions on the elements of § 669 themselves. Rather, the Defendants challenge the following: (a) the district court's instruction that AAA's contributions were Health Plan assets for purposes of § 669; (b) the district court's instruction with respect to commingling; and (c) its instruction concerning \"fiduciary principles.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. instruction that AAA's contributions belonged to Health Plan</h2>\n<p>The Defendants challenge the following instruction given by the district court:</p>\n<blockquote>[T]he [H]ealth [P]lan had a vested property interest in [the AAA's monthly] contributions[,] such [that] they constitute health plan assets under 18 U.S.Code, Section 669.</blockquote>\n<p>The Defendants argue that, by instructing the jury that the Plan had a \"vested property interest\" in the AAA monthly contributions, the district court took from the jury \"an essential element of the government's case.\" For support, the Defendants cite <i>United States v. Alessio,</i> where we reversed and remanded for a new trial when the district court made a \"finding\" during the relevant witness's testimony that the specific funds the defendant allegedly misdirected under Section 641 were \"the property of the United States.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"295409\"><a href=\"/opinion/295409/united-states-v-william-s-alessio/\"><span class=\"volume\">439</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">803</span></a></span>, 804 (1st Cir.1971) (per curiam). Moreover, the Defendants argue that the instruction is at odds with the government's concession in <i>Jackson</i> that employer contributions to an ERISA plan \"themselves are not assets of [a] plan until the contributions are paid to the plan.\" <i>Jackson,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1307</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">173</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></span>.</p>\n<p>This case is distinguishable from <i>Alessio.</i> Unlike in <i>Alessio,</i> the district court did not instruct the jury that the funds the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*383</span> Defendants <i>actually</i> embezzled were Health Plan funds. Rather, and as the government correctly points out, the district court simply described that the AAA contributions <i>generally</i> were for the Health Plan, and specifically charged the jury with determining \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" whether the <i>specific</i> \"payments that came into the ... possession of the defendants\" were Plan funds. <i>Cf. </i><i>Evans,</i> 572 F.2d at 471, 473 (in § 641 embezzlement case, affirming use of jury instruction describing \"federal character of the monies generally involved\").</p>\n<p>However, the instruction is in some tension with the government's concession in <i>Jackson.</i> Although here we express some doubt that <i>Jackson</i> applies to this case, we conclude that any error was harmless. First, and as noted above, the district court did not instruct the jury as to any element of the offense, and thus the Defendants were free to argue their theories to the jury. Second, and as discussed in more detail above, at all relevant times most or all of the Health Plan contributions were, in fact, deposited in the Plan Account to conclusively establish that the Health Plan had a \"vested property interest\" in the funds.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. commingling instruction</h2>\n<p>The district court instructed that, \"[b]ecause the [H]ealth [P]lan fund[s] [were] not ... [U]nion property,\" they \"should not\" as a general matter have been \"commingled with other [U]nion funds.\" It went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote>[t]he mere fact that funds may have been transferred from other accounts or commingled with other [U]nion funds is not enough to create criminal liability. Such co[m]mingling could have occurred for a number of reasons, such as bad advice from accountants, bad management practices on the part of some officer or officers, or because of mistakes or other innocent reasons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>But when the diversion is knowingly and willfully made into other [U]nion accounts, unrelated to the [H]ealth [P]lan, with intent to embezzle or with intent to resupply [Union money], then we [have] conduct that may constitute a federal offense under 18 U.S.Code, Section 669.</blockquote>\n<p>\"[A]t the risk of repetition,\" the court further stated:</p>\n<blockquote>remember that the commingling of funds standing alone, without proof of criminal intent proven beyond a reasonable doubt, cannot ... give rise to criminal liability. Precisely and for this reason, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt, by either direct or... circumstantial evidence[,] that the commingling of funds was part of the criminal plan to embezzle [P]lan funds, monies or assets. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt of each and every element of the offense charged is required for the government to establish that [the] charged conduct is criminal in nature[,] and that of course is for you to decide.</blockquote>\n<p>The Defendants contend that the district court improperly instructed the jury that commingling is illegal per se.<sup>[38]</sup> But the plain terms of the charge did not provide such an instruction. The district court did not instruct the jury that commingling is per se illegal. Instead, as shown above, the district court repeatedly emphasized that \"[t]he mere fact that funds may have been transferred from other accounts or commingled with other [U]nion funds <i>is not enough to create criminal liability.</i>\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*384</span> (Emphasis added). We thus reject the Defendants' claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>c. \"legal principles\" instruction</h2>\n<p>The Defendants challenge a \"legal principles\" instruction that the district court provided <i>sua sponte.</i> The district court instructed the jury that:</p>\n<blockquote>When persons hold money in trust for other persons, or for particular purposes, they have a fiduciary duty to use the trusted funds in good faith and in a scrupulous manner, acting always in the best interests of the beneficiaries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Duties general to any fiduciary relationship arise when the trust in question is, as here, a health care benefit program. You, the jury, may consider in your evaluation of the evidence whether and to what extent the government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt in this case that these fiduciary rules were or were not followed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>And there are some rules I'm going to give you as guidelines. These may not be the only rules. You may think of other rules or principles that are so obvious that I may not even put in here to give you some aid in figuring this out.</blockquote>\n<p>The court then provided a non-exclusive list of fiduciary principles that the jury could \"consider\" in determining whether the government had \"prove[n] beyond a reasonable doubt\" that a particular defendant acted \"knowingly and willfully [with] the intent to embezzle.\" The court stated, in full:</p>\n<blockquote>There are some rules that you may consider in determining whether any of the charged conduct was willfully, knowingly and intentionally made for the purpose of violating the law, or whether the charged conduct was entered into by mistake, bad management or other innocent reasons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Remember that bad management, careless or innocent reasons by themselves do not constitute a crime. Repeating myself a second: The government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the conduct charged in the indictment was knowingly and willfully performed, that is to say, the intent to embezzle or misapply as contemplated in 18 U.S.Code, Section 669.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The first rule that may assist you in figuring out whether criminal intent exists or does not exist is what can be defined as the \"solely-in-the-interest rule.\" This rule requires that management of health plan contributions be solely in the interests of the participants and the beneficiaries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The second rule that may assist you in figuring out whether criminal intent existed or not is the \"exclusive person rule.\" This rule requires that the management of the health plan contributions, or the health plan contributions be for the exclusive purpose of proving benefits to the participants and their beneficiaries; and also for the defraying reasonable expense of administering plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The third rule that you can use in the process of assessing whether criminal intent or noncriminal reasons were behind the charged conduct is the \"prudent person rule.\" Members of the board of directors of the health plan must be prudent persons, executing their fiduciary duties with care, skill, prudence, under the circumstances then prevailing. The prudent person rule requires the trustees to be familiar with the matters of the enterprise for which they act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The fourth rule that may assist you in figuring out whether criminal intent exists, or whether there was no criminal intent in the charged actions, is what I refer to as the \"plan documents rule.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*385</span> Plan documents include managerial organization charts, written descriptions of authorized positions, written descriptions of duties for each position, employment contracts, and any scope that these employment contracts may contain, Board of Directors' decisions and minutes under the legal structure of the plan under its corporate bylaws, and any other contemporaneous document that confirms or denies that the management decisions were made and contemplated as the exclusive purpose, providing benefits to the participants and their beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of administration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The fiduciary must act in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the health plan insofar as such documents and instruments are consistent with the provisions of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>To evaluate and enforce these duties in the context of a criminal statute you may focus not only on the merits of the transaction, but also on the thoroughness of the investigation made by the fiduciaries into the merits of such.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>As I have already advanced, I also instruct you that a good faith or a negligent breach of fiduciary duties, standing alone, does not create a criminal liability, but can be instructed along with other factors mentioned as to whether criminal intent is or is not present.</blockquote>\n<p>The Defendants primarily contend that the district court's instruction as to fiduciary principles were \"lengthy, legally incorrect, and complex,\" such that the district court \"engrafted\" civil ERISA law onto Section 669 and thereby \"relieved the prosecution's evidentiary burden\" to prove all elements beyond a reasonable doubt. They also argue that the Defendants' actions were authorized and that they owed no fiduciary duty, so the instructions were misplaced.</p>\n<p>We agree that the instruction is certainly \"lengthy\" and \"complex.\" Indeed, it is difficult to characterize the instruction as anything but confusing, and we do not sanction it in any way. Nevertheless, \"instructions must be evaluated not in isolation but in the context of the entire charge,\" <i>Jones,</i> 527 U.S. at 391, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118309\"><a href=\"/opinion/118309/jones-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2090</span></a></span> (citations omitted), and based upon our review of the instruction as a whole, we conclude that the instruction was harmless. First, although the district court borrowed principles from the ERISA context, the court stated that the jurors \"may consider\" the rules. Second, the district court repeated twice within this instruction that \"[t]he government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the conduct charged in the indictment was knowingly and willfully performed,\" and further instructed on this requirement four other times in the jury charge. Third, the district court instructed the jury at the beginning of its instruction \"that bad management, careless or innocent reasons by themselves do not constitute a crime\" and at the end that \"a good faith or a negligent breach of fiduciary duties, standing alone, does not create a criminal liability.\" Thus, read as a whole, the instruction did not result in an error warranting reversal. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Snyder,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"398799\"><a href=\"/opinion/398799/united-states-v-george-snyder/\"><span class=\"volume\">668</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">686</span></a></span>, 691 (2d Cir.1982) (\"We agree with appellant that he should not be convicted of a crime merely because he breached his civil fiduciary duties. But [the court] was careful to make that point, and we have no doubt that the jury grasped it.\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Money Laundering Instruction</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Román, Ramos, and Roldán separately argue that the district court erred in instructing on the elements of money laundering under 18 U.S.C. § 1956. The government has conceded that the money laundering convictions against Ramos and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*386</span> Roldán should be reversed. We thus focus on Román.</p>\n<p>The district court gave the following instruction with respect to money laundering:</p>\n<blockquote>First, that a defendant knowingly conducted or attempted to conduct a financial transaction[.] ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Second, [that] the defendant knew that the monies or funds involv[ed] [in the] financial transaction represented the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity, in this case the embezzlement of monies from a health plan organization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Third, that the funds or monies involved in the financial transaction did in fact represent the proceeds of [that] specified [unlawful] activity[.] ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Fourth, that the defendant engaged in [the] financial transaction knowing that the transaction was designed, in whole or in part, <i>to conceal</i> or to disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership or the control of the proceeds of such specified [unlawful] activity.</blockquote>\n<p>Because no defendant objected to the instruction prior to \"the jury retir[ing] to deliberating,\" we review for plain error. <i>See</i> Fed. R. Crim P. 30(d) (\"A party who objects to any portion of the instructions... must inform the court of the specific objection and the grounds for the objection before the jury retires to deliberate.... Failure to object in accordance with this rule precludes appellate review, except as permitted under Rule 52(b).\").</p>\n<p>There was no plain error. Román claims that the district court erred by only instructing the jury as to one theory of money laundering when two were charged, instructing on \"conceal[ment]\" under Section 1956(a)(1)(B)(i), but not on \"to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity\" under Section 1956(a)(1)(A)(i). However, Román cannot show that he was prejudiced because the district court failed to instruct on an alternative government theory. Román also claims that the instruction was \"jumbled,\" but does not explain how the instruction was jumbled, and we thus deem this ground waived. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Zannino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (\"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\") (citations omitted). Finally, Román cannot show prejudice because the district court did not define \"proceeds\" as \"profits,\" <i>see </i><i>Santos,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 2031 (defining \"proceeds\" as \"profits\" for purposes of the money laundering statute), because, as discussed above, a rational jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that Román in fact engaged in a conspiracy to launder profits.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>Good Faith Instruction</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Román, Ramos, and Roldán also challenge the district court's instruction on good faith. They properly preserved their claim. However, because they only object as to the form and wording of the instruction, we review for abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p>The district court provided the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote>In making a determination of whether a defendant acted with specific criminal intent to embezzle [Health Plan] funds or monies in violation of Section 669 of Title 18, or to conspire to violate Section 669[,] ... you may consider ... whether or not that defendant had a good faith belief that there was authorization by law, and whether or not that defendant had a good faith belief that [his or her] use of the [Plan's] funds was in furtherance of the interest of the [Plan].</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The government has the burden of proving that a defendant acted with the required intent[.] ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*387</span> [G]ood faith is an absolute defense to th[e] charge[s]. Accordingly, the government must prove in ... the case of each defendant, that [1] the defendant did not believe in good faith that the use of the funds ... would benefit the [Health Plan's] participants and beneficiaries[,][and][2] the defendant did not believe in good faith that his or her use of the fund[s] was authorized by the law.</blockquote>\n<p>(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Román, Ramos, and Roldán first argue that the district court erred because the instruction shifted the burden of proof onto the Defendants, \"requiring them to justify what the court clearly saw as some degree of wrongful conduct.\" However, as the quoted section shows, the instruction plainly explains that the government had \"the burden of proving that a defendant acted with the required intent.\" Román, Ramos, and Roldán further argue that the instruction \"eviscerated\" their defense that \"they had a good faith belief that the funds were Union funds.\" Although the instruction sets forth two examples of good faith conduct that the jury \"may\" consider, it did not specifically preclude the Defendant's theory. Thus, although perhaps not the most artful instruction, the district court did not abuse its discretion in providing it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. <i>Rejection of Tax Evasion Instruction</i>\n</h2>\n<p>García, Román, Ramos, Vázquez, and Roldán all argue that the district court erred when it failed to instruct the jury during the jury charge that this is not a tax evasion case. They claim, given the use of tax related evidence during the government's case in chief and closing, that declining their request to repeat the instruction prejudiced them.</p>\n<p>During the government's case-in-chief, however, and at the Defendants' request, the district court did instruct the jury that this was not a tax evasion case. The district court instructed as to the following:</p>\n<blockquote>Members of the jury, this evidence that you are going to receive now regarding the income tax returns, I should tell you that ... the case that is before us ... has nothing to do with tax evasion. Tax evasion is exclusively under the jurisdiction of the state courts, not the federal courts. And the evidence is being allowed because the Government needs to present evidence as part of their effort to prove a number of elements in the federal offenses which they think have something to do with this. That is, of course, for you to decide at the end of the case, on the basis of the instructions that I will give you. And that is the only purpose. So this is not a tax evasion case. This is a healthcare programs fraud case. That is what it is.</blockquote>\n<p>None of the above Defendants objected to the district court's decision not to provide the same instruction during the jury charge, only Caraballo did, who does not join this argument on appeal. Thus, we review for plain error. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 30(a) (\"Any party may request in writing that the court instruct the jury on the law as specified in the request. The request must be made at the close of the evidence or at any earlier time that the court reasonably sets.\"); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Harris,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"11168\"><a href=\"/opinion/11168/united-states-v-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1465</span></a></span>, 1471 (5th Cir.1997) (\"[T]he greater weight of authority counsels that a party can rely upon the objection of his codefendant only if he joins in the objection,\" citing cases).</p>\n<p>The above Defendants claim prejudice, but it is difficult to see how, when the mid-trial instruction was correct, and case law presumes that \"jurors ... follow the trial judge's instructions.\" <i>United States v. Torres,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198221\"><a href=\"/opinion/198221/united-states-v-torres/\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 12 (1st Cir.1998); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Rivera-Gómez,</i> 67 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*388</span> F.3d 993, 999 (1st Cir.1995) (\"[J]urors are not children.\") <i>overruled on other grounds by </i><i>Jones v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118274\"><a href=\"/opinion/118274/jones-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">227</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118274\"><a href=\"/opinion/118274/jones-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">311</span></a></span> (1999). Moreover, García specifically argues that prejudice may have resulted from the government's closing, but the government reminded the jurors in closing that \"[t]his is not a tax evasion case.\" We thus see no error.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Trial Procedure</h2>\n<p>The Defendants also raise a number of issues with respect to the district court's management of the trial.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Mid-Trial Severance Challenge</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Vázquez separately contends that the district court abused its discretion when it refused to grant a mid-trial severance based on his attorney's alleged conflict of interest. Vázquez argues that he was discouraged from testifying by his counsel as a result of this asserted conflict, affecting the outcome of the proceedings.</p>\n<p>As background, Francisco Dolz, counsel for Andino, informed the government during its case-in-chief that Angel Tapia, counsel for Vázquez, had admitted to doctoring minutes concerning the Welfare Account. The government filed a sealed motion informing the district court of the allegation, and requested a hearing. The court held a hearing that same day, with Dolz testifying that Tapia had admitted to him that Tapia's handwriting appeared on the doctored minutes. The district court ordered Tapia to respond, and the next day Tapia declared that the allegation was \"totally untrue,\" but that the allegation created \"a conflict of interest\" that required severing Vázquez's case mid-trial. The district court denied the motion, finding no conflict, but further required Tapia to respond to the allegation in writing. Tapia filed a sworn statement, stating that \"I have never told attorney Francisco Dolz expressions to the effect that I have altered any minute or any document of any kind of the [Union],\" and further stating that the allegation was based on a misunderstanding.</p>\n<p>Vázquez appeals the denial of his mid-trial severance motion. Since a \"mid-trial severance is ... an extraordinary measure,\" we will \"overturn [a denial for severance] only if [the court's] wide discretion is plainly abused.\" <i>United States v. Sotomayor-Vázquez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199390\"><a href=\"/opinion/199390/united-states-v-sotomayor-vazquez/\"><span class=\"volume\">249</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.2001) (citations and quotations omitted). Moreover, where, as here, a defendant claims that a conflict of interest warrants a new trial, he \"must show that the lawyer could have pursued a plausible alternative defense strategy or tactic and that the alternative strategy or tactic was inherently in conflict with or not undertaken due to the attorney's other interests or loyalties.\" <i>Id.</i> at 15 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>Vázquez contends that Tapia's conflict of interest, particularly his purportedly doctoring the Welfare Account minutes, caused Tapia to discourage Vázquez from testifying. However, Vázquez's claim of \"intimidation\" has no support in the record, and Vázquez does not cite to any. Furthermore, Vázquez failed to file any pro se motion contending that Tapia discouraged him from testifying, or claimed that he was prevented from doing so. In any event, the proper vehicle for relief for ineffective assistance of counsel is a motion under 28 U.S.C. § 2255, not direct appeal. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Genao,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199851\"><a href=\"/opinion/199851/united-states-v-genao/\"><span class=\"volume\">281</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">305</span></a></span>, 313 (1st Cir.2002) (\"[W]e do not entertain ineffective assistance claims on direct appeal absent an evidentiary record that allows us to evaluate the fact-specific allegations. The preferable vehicle for such claims is a collateral proceeding under 28 U.S.C. § 2255.\") (citation omitted).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*389</span> Given the lack of any record support to substantiate Vázquez's claim, and the process afforded to Vázquez by the district court, it is hard to see any abuse of discretion on the part of the district court in denying a severance. Accordingly, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to sever mid-trial.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Misstatement in Closing Argument</i>\n</h2>\n<p>García and Vázquez both argue that the district court abused its discretion when it declined to grant them a new trial based on an alleged misstatement made during the prosecution's closing argument.</p>\n<p>As we noted earlier, during the strike in 2004, the Union paid each of its members $300 every two weeks. In its rebuttal closing argument, the prosecution argued that (1) this money came from the Union Account; (2) the Union Account contained Health Plan funds; and (3) the Plan thus helped pay for the strike, even though its funds were not meant for that purpose. The prosecutor further stated:</p>\n<blockquote>I did my math. And it's approximately $5.8 million that the [U]nion dished out for those picketing workers on the lines, the striking people, the people that were out. And I'm not saying that those people don't deserve to get monies. I'm saying not from health care funds. Where did the [U]nion get $5.8 million during the strike? Where did the [U]nion get the money to pay Héctor René Lugo and all these people?</blockquote>\n<p>None of the defendants contemporaneously objected to this line of argument during the closing itself, but they all objected at a sidebar afterward. They claimed that the argument was \"false\" because, according to them, the money for the picketing workers came from a Union \"strike fund,\" not from Health Plan funds. The district court overruled the objection.</p>\n<p>As García and Vázquez preserved their claim, we review <i>de novo</i> whether the prosecution's remarks were improper. <i>United States v.

We consider the following factors in considering prejudice:</p>\n<blockquote>(1) the severity of the prosecutor's misconduct, including whether it was deliberate or accidental; (2) the context in which the misconduct occurred; (3) whether the judge gave curative instructions and the likely effect of such instructions; and (4) the strength of the evidence against the defendants.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Nelson-Rodríguez,</i> 319 F.3d at 38 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p>García and Vázquez contend that the government's remarks at closing were improper, claiming that (1) the Union paid the striking workers from \"Banco Santander [Account] No. XXXXXXXXXX\"; (2) that the account belonged to the Union, not the Health Plan; and (3) the Plan thus did not help pay for the strike, and the prosecution, in arguing to the contrary, had \"misstate[d] evidence\" and \"misl[e]d the jury.\" In response, the government contends that \"Banco Santander No. 1310003987\" <i>was</i> the Union Account, as defined in the indictment, and, since the Plan funds were diverted to that Account, the government's remarks were factually accurate.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*390</span> Even if improper, the remarks had no effect on the trial outcome, as the case concerned not <i>how</i> the striking workers were paid, but whether the Defendants paid themselves with money they knew did not belong to them. At best, this is a \"stray remark\" that is too inconsequential to warrant reversal. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Martínez-Medina,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776396\"><a href=\"/opinion/776396/united-states-v-marcos-martinez-medina-united-states-of-america-v-manuel/\"><span class=\"volume\">279</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span>, 119 (1st Cir.2002). Finally, as correctly noted by the government, the district court instructed the jury that closing statements are \"not evidence.\" Accordingly, we see no reversible error.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>Post-Trial Threats and Harassment</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Caraballo, Andino, and Urbina argue that the district court abused its discretion in declining to grant them a new trial based on their post-trial allegations that Lugo and others discouraged them, through threats and harassment, from testifying.</p>\n<p>As background, the Defendants were found guilty on June 16, 2006. Six months later, during a December 6, 2006 sentencing hearing, Urbina alleged for the first time that Lugo and other unnamed individuals had issued veiled threats that had discouraged him, Caraballo, and Andino from testifying at trial on their own behalf. Urbina further asserted that he, Caraballo, and Andino would have testified that they were not at the purported board meetings concerning the loans from the Union to the Health Plan.</p>\n<p>On February 2, 2007, Caraballo, Andino, and Urbina moved for a new trial, arguing that the alleged threats constituted \"newly discovered evidence\" under Rule 33(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The district court denied the motion, finding that any threats had not been \"serious enough\" to dissuade the defendants from testifying and that their decision not to testify was in fact a \"strateg[ic]\" one.</p>\n<p>Caraballo, Andino, and Urbina renew their arguments on appeal, and contend that they are entitled to a new trial. \"We review a district court's denial of a new trial motion for manifest abuse of discretion.\" <i>United States v. Del-Valle,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203815\"><a href=\"/opinion/203815/united-states-v-del-valle/\"><span class=\"volume\">566</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span>, 38 (1st Cir.2009). \"The remedy of a new trial must be used sparingly, and only where a miscarriage of justice would otherwise result.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>United States v. Conley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199406\"><a href=\"/opinion/199406/united-states-v-conley/\"><span class=\"volume\">249</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span>, 45 (1st Cir.2001)).</p>\n<blockquote>A defendant who seeks a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence bears a `weighty burden' of establishing that: (1) the evidence was unknown or unavailable to the defendant at the time of trial; (2) failure to learn of the evidence was not due to lack of diligence by the defendant; (3) the evidence is material and not merely cumulative or impeaching; and (4) the emergence of the evidence will probably result in an acquittal upon retrial of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>There was no abuse of discretion. First, if their claims of threats were true, then obviously they would have known about the threats during trial. Thus, their evidence cannot be \"newly discovered,\" as they cannot claim that the threats were \"unknown or unavailable to [them] at the time of trial.\" <i>See </i><i>United States v. Wright,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"380303\"><a href=\"/opinion/380303/united-states-v-henry-james-wright-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">625</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1017</span></a></span>, 1019 (1st Cir.1980). Second, they cannot show any prejudice. This is because their claim that they would have testified that they did not participate in purported board meetings concerning the loans from the Union to the Health Plan would have <i>supported</i> the government's theory that these meetings never occurred and that minutes over those loan meetings were doctored.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*391</span> D. Sentencing</h2>\n<p>Finally, some of the Defendants appeal their sentences. As a threshold matter, the government concedes that, because the convictions for the Seven Chapter Presidents for money laundering must be set aside, they are entitled to resentencing. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Meader,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198715\"><a href=\"/opinion/198715/united-states-v-meader/\"><span class=\"volume\">195</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">66</span></a></span>, 68 (1st Cir.1999) (resentencing appropriate where the Court \"[could] not say that the trial judge would have reached the same sentence within the range\"). Since the government concedes that the Chapter President Defendants are entitled to resentencing, we decline to address any of their arguments with respect to their sentences. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Pinillos-Prieto,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201767\"><a href=\"/opinion/201767/united-states-v-pinillos/\"><span class=\"volume\">419</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">61</span></a></span>, 74-75 &amp; n. 14 (1st Cir. 2005) (declining to reach drug quantity claims given vacatur and remand of sentences in light of government's concession of <i>Booker</i> error). We thus address only the sentencing challenges of the Top Four Defendants, and do not discuss the merits of the other Defendants' sentencing challenges.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Loss Calculation Enhancement</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Some of the Top Four Defendants contend that the district court erred in assessing against each of the defendants an 18-level enhancement under the Sentencing Guidelines based on a \"loss\" calculation of between $2,500,000 and $7,000,000.</p>\n<p>\"Under the advisory guidelines regime, the district court can use the preponderance of the evidence standard to determine whether an enhancement applies.\" <i>United States v. Pierre,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202709\"><a href=\"/opinion/202709/united-states-v-pierre/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span>, 89 (1st Cir.2007) (quoting <i>United States v. Holliday,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">121</span></span>, 130 (1st Cir.2006)). Accordingly, we review the district court's \"factbound\" determinations for purposes of sentencing for clear error. <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>United States v. Ventura,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784542\"><a href=\"/opinion/784542/united-states-v-rafael-ventura/\"><span class=\"volume\">353</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">84</span></a></span>, 89 (1st Cir.2003)).</p>\n<p>As background, the district court applied U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(1) (2005), and applied an 18-level enhancement for each defendant under Section 2B1.1(b)(1)(J), since the loss amount the court calculated (approximately $5.5 million, with $1.1 million added to Lugo and Román for misapplying additional funds) was between $2.5 million and $7.5 million. Application Note 3(E)(I) to U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(1) provides an offset for \"[t]he money returned, and the fair market value of the property returned and the services rendered, by the defendant or other persons acting jointly with the defendant, to the victim before the offense was detected.\" We review the district court's determination for clear error.</p>\n<p>On appeal, the Top Four Defendants all challenge the district court's loss calculation on two grounds: (1) none of them could have foreseen the amounts that each of the other defendants would receive, such that each defendant's loss amount should, at the most, be the amount he or she <i>individually</i> received; <i>see </i><i>United States v. Codarcea,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202995\"><a href=\"/opinion/202995/united-states-v-codarcea/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span>, 72 (1st Cir.2007) (under Section 2B1.1, a conspirator will be held accountable for losses within the scope of a conspiracy that \"would have been foreseeable by a reasonable person in [the conspirator's] shoes\"); and (2) the court should have credited them for \"services rendered.\"</p>\n<p>The first ground fails. The Top Four Defendants' extensive knowledge and control of the embezzlement scheme as a whole made the total amount foreseeable. As to the second ground, the Top Four Defendants premise their argument on the fact that their scheme was detected in 2004, but the evidence shows that the date of detection was as early as 2000, when the OIC audited the Health Plan. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*392</span> § 2B1.1 cmt. n. 3(E)(I) (defining \"time of detection\" as \"the earlier of (I) the time of the offense was discovered by a victim or government agency; or (II) the time the defendant knew or reasonably should have known that the offense was detected or about to be detected by a victim or government agency\"). By that time, the evidence showed that the AAA paid $1.2 million pursuant to the \"labor license.\" Assuming the same amount for services rendered to the Plan, it would not lower the total amount embezzled below the $2.5 million threshold for the enhancement. Thus, we find no error.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Lugo Enhancements</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Lugo separately argues that the court's factual findings with respect to his sentencing enhancements for (1) using sophisticated means, (2) deriving more than $1,000,000 from a financial institution, and (3) organizing or leading an extensive criminal activity, were clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p>As background, at Lugo's sentencing, the district court assessed a base offense level of seven, pursuant to U.S.S.G. §§ 2S1.1(a)(1) &amp; 2B1.1(a)(1), and then the following enhancements: an 18-level loss enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(1), as already discussed; a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2S1.1(b)(2)(B), because Lugo was convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1956; a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3, because Lugo abused a position of trust; a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(9)(C), because Lugo used \"sophisticated means\" in committing the offense; a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(14)(A), because Lugo derived more than $1,000,000 in gross receipts from a \"financial institution[ ]\"; and a four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(a), because Lugo was an \"organizer or leader\" of an extensive criminal activity involving five or more participants. Lugo objected to the enhancements for using sophisticated means, deriving more than $1,000,000 from a financial institution, and organizing or leading an extensive criminal activity. The district court overruled his objections.</p>\n<p>As Lugo preserved his claims, we review the district court's factual findings supporting these enhancements for clear error.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. sophisticated means</h2>\n<p>As to using sophisticated means, Lugo used several Union Accounts (the Infrastructure Account, the Administrative Account, and the Welfare Account) to conceal and move millions of dollars. The record also shows that Lugo filed fraudulent tax returns and that he participated in doctoring minutes of meetings. These are sufficient \"sophisticated means\" to support the enhancement. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Edelmann,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795316\"><a href=\"/opinion/795316/united-states-v-mary-k-edelmann/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">791</span></a></span>, 816 (8th Cir. 2006) (affirming where the defendant \"created and used numerous false documents,\" \"including multiple years of federal tax returns,\" fake loan documents, and misleading bank statements; even assuming the component parts of the scheme were not complex, \"the total scheme was sophisticated\"). The only things that Lugo raises in response are the same claims that support his sufficiency claims, which we have already rejected.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. $1,000,000 in gross receipts from a \"financial institution[ ]\"</h2>\n<p>As to \"deriving more than $1,000,000 from a financial institution,\" Lugo argues that the Plan does not qualify as a \"financial institution.\" However, U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1 cmt. n. 1 defines a \"financial institution\" as the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Financial institution\" includes any ... union or employee pension <span class=\"star-pagination\">*393</span> fund; any health, medical, or hospital insurance association;... and any similar entity, whether or not insured by the federal government. \"Union or employee pension fund\" and \"any health, medical, or hospital insurance association,\" primarily include large pension funds that serve many persons ... and associations that undertake to provide pension, disability, or other benefits (e.g., medical or hospitalization insurance) to large numbers of persons.</blockquote>\n<p>The Health Plan clearly falls within this definition. We thus reject Lugo's claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>c. \"organizer or leader\"</h2>\n<p>As to his \"organizer or leader\" enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(a), Lugo argues that the district court clearly erred in imposing the enhancement because, he claims, there was no evidence that Lugo managed participants. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Cali,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196836\"><a href=\"/opinion/196836/united-states-v-cali/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">571</span></a></span>, 578 (1st Cir.1996) (noting that, \"[i]n the past, we have required some `degree of control or organizational authority over others' to support a section 3B1.1(b) adjustment\"). Lugo, in particular, argues that the district court clearly erred when it found at sentencing that Lugo \"recruit[ed]\" the other Defendants to participate in the scheme, as all of the Defendants were elected to their positions. But such a finding is not clearly erroneous given that the evidence showed his extensive coordination of the various activities engaged in by the Defendants, such as falsifying loan documents, doctoring minutes, and bamboozling the OIC concerning the administrative services contract. Thus, his coordination supports a reasonable inference that he recruited the others to participate. In any event, his involvement in all of these activities supports the district court's ultimate finding that \"[f]rankly, this [crime] would not have happened [but] for the fact that [Lugo] was there.\" Finally, Lugo seizes on the district court's statement that \"[t]here is no leader here,\" but the district court made this statement in response to defense counsel's statement that the Defendants \"were elected by the <i>leadership.</i>\" (Emphasis added). Read in context, the statement only corrects defense counsel's statement. Accordingly, the district court did not err in imposing the enhancement.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>Substantive Reasonableness</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Finally, Lugo and Román challenge the substantive reasonableness of their sentences under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), citing their old age and poor health. Lugo separately challenges the disparity between his sentence and that of Román. Lugo was sentenced to 210 months and Román to 108 months.</p>\n<p>We review a substantive reasonableness challenge under an \"abuse-of-discretion standard.\" <i>Gall v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145843\"><a href=\"/opinion/145843/gall-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">552</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145843\"><a href=\"/opinion/145843/gall-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span> (2007). Specifically, we review a within Guidelines sentence only for whether it represents \"a defensible overall result.\" <i>United States v. Jiménez-Beltre,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></span>, 518 (1st Cir.2006) (en banc).</p>\n<p>We conclude that the result here was defensible. Román claims that nine years \"is a very long time\" for someone with his health conditions, but fails to show that he cannot get adequate medical care in prison. Neither does Lugo, who makes the same argument. Given the severity and sophistication of their offenses, their sentences are appropriate despite their ages. Lugo separately emphasizes the disparity between his sentence (210 months) and Román's sentence (108), arguing that their <span class=\"star-pagination\">*394</span> sentences must be \"aligned\" because the \"disparit[y][is] conspicuous and threaten[s] to undermine confidence in the criminal justice system.\" <i>United States v. Martin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203196\"><a href=\"/opinion/203196/united-states-v-martin/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></a></span>, 94 (1st Cir.2008). However, we leave such alignment to the discretion of the district court, <i>see id.,</i> and the district court did not abuse its discretion here, where Lugo's longer sentence is justified by, among other things, the fact that he embezzled double the amount of funds as did Román. For all of these reasons, we reject their claims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the forgoing reasons, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed in part, Reversed in part, and Remanded.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Second Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  At trial, José Nieves, AAA's Labor Relations manager labor, testified that SINOT was a Spanish acronym for \"temporary disability insurance, occupational insurance.\"</p>\n<p>[2]  The collective bargaining agreement relevant to this appeal was in effect from 1998 until 2003. Afterwards, and as discussed below, the Union went on strike after negotiations broke down on a new collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p>[3]  The provision states:\n</p>\n<p>The [AAA] shall grant the Union full leave with pay to the members of the executive central committee of the Union.... The Union shall reimburse said salaries including fringe benefits.</p>\n<p>[4]  The provision states:\n</p>\n<p>The [AAA] agrees to contribute to the health insurance plan the following amounts for each Union member employee so that the employee, his spouse and dependent children under the age of 19 or, if they continue on as full-time students, up to the age of 23, may enjoy the following services: A) A family health insurance plan that includes hospitalization, surgery, and dispensary services B) a medicine payment plan, C) a dental plan, D) major medical, and E) eyeglasses.</p>\n<p>[5]  These provisions were in the collective bargaining agreement in effect at the time of the incorporation, and were carried over into the collective bargaining agreement at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p>[6]  Specifically, the bylaws provided that \"[t]he [AAA] shall send directly to the [Union] on or before the fifth (5th) day of each month the amount corresponding to the number of Union employees covered monthly by the plan as of the last day of the preceding month.\" In addition, José Nieves, the AAA's Labor Relations manager, testified that the collective bargaining agreement \"established that [the payments] would be paid to Héctor René Lugo and [the Union],\" but that the checks were \"identified for health plan.\"</p>\n<p>[7]  The checks stated, below the name of the Union as payee, \"Aportación Plan Médico,\" which was translated at trial as \"health plan contribution.\"</p>\n<p>[8]  At trial the statute was translated as \"fiduciarily responsible,\" although the official translation of the statute translates the words as \"fiducially liable.\" <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 1907 (\"Fiduciary liability[:] Any director, officer or member of a health service[ ] organization who receives, collects, disburses or invests funds related to the activities of said organization, shall be fiducially liable for the funds received from the subscribers.\").</p>\n<p>[9]  <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 1903a(2) (\"The Commissioner may examine and investigate [those organizations subject to its jurisdiction] with the purpose of determining their organization and solvency, as well as their compliance with the provisions of this Code.\"); <i>id.</i> § 1918 (setting forth required examinations of organizations subject to the OIC's oversight).</p>\n<p>[10]  <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 1905(2)(a) (\"A health services organization, before exercising... the power to contract administrative functions ... shall furnish to the Commissioner the adequate information to justify the exercise of said powers.\").</p>\n<p>[11]  The collective bargaining agreement provides:\n</p>\n<p>The stipulation between [the Union] and the AAA dated October 1, 1991 (requiring that in the event of an operational deficit in the plan due to causes not attributable to illegal appropriation, malfeasance, misuse of funds or negligence of the plan manager), the parties shall meet to analyze and resolve the deficits (shall continue in effect with that review, except for the change of the fiscal year to natural year as required by [the Union]).</p>\n<p>[12]  The checks were:\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<pre>\n  1. September 14, 2001  -$  496,157.05\n  2. September 26, 2001  -$  555,535.65\n  3. October 2, 2001     -$  261,000.00\n  4. October 3, 2001     -$1,142,199.25\n</pre>\n<p>The checks totaled $2,454,891.95.</p>\n<p>[13]  Late in 2001, however, the Defendants directly deposited more than $3M of the contributions into the Union Account without first depositing the funds into the Plan Account.\n</p>\n<p>At the same time, the Defendants began making frequent transfers from the Union Account to the so-called Cultural Trips Account, which also belonged to the Union. For the next several years, García would receive regular payments from the Cultural Trips Account. All told, she received $209,379 from the account during the period when it contained diverted Health Plan funds. Like the payments she received from the Infrastructure and Union Accounts, she did not report any of the Cultural Trips payments in her tax returns.</p>\n<p>[14]  As discussed in more detail below, the balance sheets did not reflect all funds available to the Union, such as the SINOT contributions, but it did comprise the income the Union reported that it received.</p>\n<p>[15]  The 1999 certification, for example, states:\n</p>\n<p>I certify that the Board of Directors of the UIA's Health Plan, Inc., has not officially met during the last two years. However, all of its members discuss and analyze the diversity of administrative issues of their incumbency on a daily basis. The reason for this being that the premiums of the UIA Health Plan, Inc. are paid entirely by the employer ([AAA]) and are subject to the negotiation of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.</p>\n<p>[16]  In fact, Rubén Luciano Guzmán (\"Luciano\"), the Health Plan's accountant, testified at trial that the Welfare Account effectively belonged to the Union because he never had access to it.</p>\n<p>[17]  <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 1908(2)(a) (\"Every health services organization shall register the rates to be used in any health care plan with the Commissioner before applying them in Puerto Rico.\").</p>\n<p>[18]  After challenging the finding, the Defendants would later be fined for the violation in August 2003.</p>\n<p>[19]  Luciano would testify at trial that Carrasquillo told him that he opened the Welfare Account because the OIC had fined them for sending the Plan a \"surplus\" above $222 and that he wanted \"to avoid further fines.\" Luciano further testified that he did not believe Carrasquillo because, to avoid fines, the Defendants either would have discontinued using unapproved rates or would have asked for a rate increase.</p>\n<p>[20]  In April 2004, Román retired as Union treasurer and was replaced by Víctor Cornier (\"Cornier\"). Román proceeded to receive $30,000 from the Infrastructure, Union, and Administrative Accounts as an \"[e]xtraordinary bonus for [his] years of service,\" although the maximum bonus authorized by the constitution was $1,000.</p>\n<p>[21]  This excluded the amounts that García had received from the Cultural Trips Account.</p>\n<p>[22]  The indictment also contained two forfeiture counts, Counts 141-42, that were later dismissed by the district court and are not at issue on appeal.</p>\n<p>[23]  For example, Counts 2-13 charged Lugo with embezzlement of \"assets of the [Health Plan], a health care benefit program, as defined in Title 18, United States Code, Section 24,\" and listed twelve checks, including dates, check numbers, amounts, and the account the check came from (Infrastructure, Union, or Administration). The Counts were allocated as follows:\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<pre>\nCarrasquillo        Counts 14-25\nGarcía              Counts 26-36\nRomán               Counts 37-48\nCaraballo           Counts 49-60\nAndino              Counts 61-72\nMartínez            Counts 73-84\nRamos               Counts 85-96\nVázquez             Counts 97-108\nUrbina              Counts 109-120\nRoldán       Counts 121-132\n</pre>\n<p>[24]  Of particular note, Counts 137 and 138 charged Lugo and Román with misapplying funds from the Old Health Plan (specifically, checks of $1,000 and $43,063) to purchase a \"2003 Jaguar X-Type ... for the personal use of defendant Lugo.\"</p>\n<p>[25]  Lugo separately argues that 18 U.S.C. § 669 is \"void for vagueness\" since it \"d[oes] not make ... reasonably clear that the compensation [he] received\" was prohibited. Lugo claims that the Union's constitution, its collective bargaining agreement, and the Plan's bylaws all failed to give him \"fair warning\" that he could not take the payments that he did. His claim, however, is better understood as a <i>sufficiency</i> claim as to whether his conduct was \"knowing and willing.\" We discuss that sufficiency claim in more detail below.</p>\n<p>[26]  The Defendants, in supplemental briefing, concede that their argument as to the character of the funds does not apply to Count 1, the conspiracy to embezzle count, and Count 140, the money laundering count.</p>\n<p>[27]  The Defendants do not dispute that the Health Plan is a \"health care benefit program\" under § 669, which is defined broadly as:\n</p>\n<p>[A]ny public or private plan or contract, affecting commerce, under which any medical benefit, item, or service is provided to any individual, and includes any individual or entity who is providing a medical benefit, item, or service for which payment may be made under the plan or contract.</p>\n<p>18 U.S.C. § 24(b) (defining a \"health care benefit program\" for purposes of § 669). The definition applies with equal force to the Old Health Plan, and thus to the misapplication counts (Counts 133-39) involving those funds. Accordingly, we reject Lugo and Román's contention otherwise.</p>\n<p>[28]  18 U.S.C. § 641 provides, in pertinent part:\n</p>\n<p>Whoever embezzles, steals, purloins, or knowingly converts to his use or the use of another, or without authority, sells, conveys or disposes of any record, voucher, money, or thing of value of the United States or of any department or agency thereof, or any property made or being made under contract for the United States or any department or agency thereof;</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both; but if the value of such property in the aggregate, combining amounts from all the counts for which the defendant is convicted in a single case, does not exceed the sum of $1,000, he shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.</p>\n<p>[29]  At least one circuit has noted that Section 669, and HIPAA generally, were \"broad measures Congress enacted in its effort to `combat waste, fraud, and abuse in health insurance and health care delivery.'\" <i>Whited,</i> 311 F.3d at 268 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>[30]  These secondary sources do not cite any legislative history for this proposition, nor do the parties cite any.</p>\n<p>[31]  We note that <i>Jackson</i> differs from this case in two material respects. First, <i>Jackson</i> concerned whether a bare contractual obligation that had become due could be considered an \"asset\" for purposes of the ERISA theft statute. <i>See </i><i>Jackson,</i> 524 F.3d at 544. In contrast, the funds here were not just contractual obligations, but <i>actual checks</i> that, on their face, were made out for <i>the specific purpose</i> of funding the Health Plan. Thus, at issue here are not contractual obligations but actual property. Second, the employer in <i>Jackson</i> owed no fiduciary duty to the beneficiaries of the unpaid contributions. <i>See id.</i> at 545 (rejecting claim that unpaid contributions were assets of the Plan because the defendant employers \"were never fiduciaries of the Plan[]\"). In contrast, upon receiving the checks, the Defendants in this case had a fiduciary duty to the Health Plan insofar as they were simultaneously on the Plan's board.\n</p>\n<p>We further note that the Defendants' position has absurd consequences. Indeed, at oral argument, one judge on this panel noted that, under the Defendants' position, the Defendants could not be convicted under § 669 if they had never deposited the Health Plan contributions into the Plan Account <i>at all,</i> and just immediately deposited the contributions into the Defendants' personal bank accounts. Defense counsel responded that \"it does not seem that I am arguing that.\"</p>\n<p>[32]  In fact, as noted in the background section above, from 1998 to 2001 the total amount actually <i>paid</i> to the Defendants was similar in amount (or exceeded) the total amount of reported income for the Union.</p>\n<p>[33]  Like the Health Plan contributions at issue in this appeal, the Defendants were similarly constrained in their use of these other funds. In addition, the funds were similarly not reported in the Union's balance sheets. In essence, the Defendants argue that their convictions cannot stand because they were guilty of embezzling different funds.</p>\n<p>[34]  For example, one might funnel small values of embezzled funds through an account that contains mostly non-embezzled funds, such that embezzled funds never comprise a substantial portion of that account. Although we conclude in this case that the Infrastructure Account <i>did</i> contain mostly Health Plan funds, as a hypothetical matter, we find it difficult to believe that a defendant could avoid liability through such a scheme.</p>\n<p>[35]  The Defendants do not present this challenge as a separate basis for reversal, but as part and parcel of their claim that the evidence establishing their lack of authority was insufficient.</p>\n<p>[36]  It is unclear whether the Defendants challenged the willful blindness instruction as a separate ground for reversal. To the extent that they did, any such error was harmless because, as discussed below, the evidence was sufficient to support their direct knowledge of the scheme.</p>\n<p>[37]  We note that none of the challenges here involve a claim of structural error, which would not require a showing of prejudice. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Brandao,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1427539\"><a href=\"/opinion/1427539/united-states-v-brandao/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span>, 58 (1st Cir.2008) (defining structural errors as \"constitutional errors that deprive the defendant of a fundamentally fair trial and thus may not be found harmless under Rule 52(a)'s harmless error standard\").</p>\n<p>[38]  García and Vázquez argue that the government argued in closing that commingling itself \"made the receipt of all compensation by [the defendants] illegal.\" However, they cite no transcript page for that claim, and we cannot find any record of it.</p>\n\n</div>",
