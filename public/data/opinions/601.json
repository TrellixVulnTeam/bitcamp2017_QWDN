Steven J. McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                    Before\n\n                         Lynch, Chief Judge,\n                  Boudin and Stahl, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Darren F. Starr on brief pro se.\n     Michael A. Delaney, Attorney General, and Glenn A. Perlow,\nAssistant Attorney General, on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n                               March 25, 2010\n\f            Per Curiam.      New Hampshire state inmate Darren Starr\n\nappeals from a district court Order dated January 29, 2009, which\n\ngranted summary judgment in defendants' favor on claims raised in\n\nStarr's complaint under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.              On de novo review, we\n\naffirm the district court's judgment for the following reasons.\n\n            1.      Judgment in defendants' favor on Starr's First\n\nAmendment claim based on the denial and destruction of his letter\n\nfrom Trina Catalino was warranted.              In his written complaints\n\nrelating to the handling of his \"mail\" from Catalino, Starr made no\n\nmention of a letter, and he affirmatively represented that her mail\n\nincluded only copies of state law printed from an Internet website.\n\nAs to the letter, therefore, Starr failed to include the \"nature of\n\n[his] complaint,” as was required by the DOC's grievance policy.\n\nHence, this First Amendment claim was not properly exhausted.\n\nJones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 218 (2007) (the \"level of detail\n\nnecessary    in    a   grievance\"    required    for   proper    exhaustion   is\n\ndetermined    by    reference   to    the    requirements   of    the   prison's\n\ngrievance procedures) (citing Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 88\n\n(2006)).\n\n            2.     For reasons essentially given by the district court,\n\nwe agree that entry of judgment in defendants' favor was warranted\n\non Starr's First Amendment claim that defendants had unreasonably\n\napplied a volume limit and the DOC's Publisher's Only Rule (POR) to\n\ndeny him the 38-page printout of state laws that was sent by\n\n                                       -2-\n\fCatalino.         On   appeal,     Starr    essentially    proffers   only   legal\n\narguments    that      are   not    persuasive.      For   example,   he   ignores\n\nrelevant reasoning in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979), which\n\npartly upheld the POR in that case because it was reasonably\n\nrelated to the facility's legitimate interest in having staff avoid\n\ntime-consuming searches of each page of incoming publications. Id.\n\nat 549, 551.       In addition, he relies on Clement v. Calif. Dept. of\n\nCorrection, 220 F. Supp. 2d 1098, 1108 (N.D. Cal. 2002), aff'd, 364\n\nF.3d 1148 (9th Cir. 2004), which is distinguishable on its facts.\n\n             3.    Starr's argument that provisions in the DOC's mail\n\npolicy, PPD 5.26, which were applied to deny the Internet printouts\n\nhe received were unconstitutionally vague is unpersuasive.                   During\n\nthe summary judgment proceedings, moreover, he did not press that\n\nclaim relative to Catalino's letter, so we need not address it.\n\nMedical Mut. Ins. Co. of Maine v. Indian Harbor Ins. Co., 583 F.3d\n\n57, 61 (1st Cir. 2009) (a claim not advanced in the district court\n\n\"is procedurally defaulted\") (citation omitted).\n\n             4.    Starr's claim that defendants deprived him of the\n\nfull 10-day appeal period in the DOC's mail policy, PPD 5.26, and\n\neffectively shortened it to 5 days, asserts at best a violation of\n\nstate law. Under federal law, Starr was entitled to a \"reasonable\"\n\nopportunity to protest the denial of his mail.                Bonner v. Outlaw,\n\n552   F.3d   673,      676   (8th    Cir.    2009)   (construing   Procunier    v.\n\nMartinez, 416 U.S. 396, 418-19 (1974)); accord Lena v. Dubois, 19\n\n\n                                            -3-\n\fF.3d 1427, *1 (1st Cir. 1994) (unpublished per curiam).
