Plaintiff-appellant Israel Santiago-Lugo\n\nappeals from the district court's dismissal of his claim pursuant\n\nto Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(g) for the return of property as barred by\n\nthe statute of limitations.                \"We review de novo a district court's\n\norder       granting    a     Rule    12(b)(6)     motion     based     on    statute    of\n\nlimitations grounds.\" Lopez-Gonzalez v. Municipality of Comerio,\n\n404 F.3d 548, 551 (1st Cir. 2005).                      We have not had occasion\n\npreviously      to     rule    on    the    question    of    what     the    statute    of\n\nlimitations is for Rule 41(g) claims, but all the circuits that\n\nhave considered the issue have held that the six-year statute of\n\nlimitations under 28 U.S.C. § 2401(a) applies to civil actions for\n\nthe return of property. See Bertin v. United States, 478 F.3d 489,\n\n493 (2d Cir. 2007) (collecting cases).                  We join those circuits in\n\nholding that the six-year limitations period under § 2401(a)\n\napplies to Rule 41(g) claims.                We also concur with those circuits\n\nwhich have held that in circumstances like this, where \"there has\n\nbeen    a    related     criminal       proceeding      but     no    civil   forfeiture\n\nproceeding, the cause of action accrues at the end of the criminal\n\nproceeding.\" Id.; see United States v. Sims, 376 F.3d 705, 709 (7th\n\nCir. 2004); United States v. Rodriguez-Aguirre, 264 F.3d 1195, 1212\n\n(10th Cir. 2001).\n\n               Santiago-Lugo's         claim   for     return    of    seized    but    not\n\nforfeited property was initially presented in his motion filed on\n\nJuly 11, 2005.         He was sentenced and judgment entered more than six\n\n\n                                             -2-\n\fyears earlier, on April 17, 1996.                Even if the conclusion of\n\ncriminal proceedings occurs after the defendant's direct appeal is\n\nresolved, that occurred here on February 3, 1999, still more than\n\nsix years before Santiago-Lugo filed his Rule 41 motion. See\n\nRodriguez-Aguirre, 264 F.3d at 1214 n. 15 (declining to determine\n\nwhether the conclusion of criminal proceedings occurs after the\n\ntrial and sentencing or only after the appeals process has run its\n\ncourse).\n\n              Santiago-Lugo argues (as he did in the district court)\n\nthat the statute of limitations did not begin to run until August\n\n12,   2005,    the   date   on   which    the   district   court   granted   the\n\ngovernment's Rule 36 motion to amend the judgment to include the\n\nforfeiture order.       However, the rationale for the accrual date\n\noccurring when the criminal proceedings have concluded is that\n\n\"once the criminal proceedings or the civil forfeiture proceedings\n\nhave concluded without the property having been forfeited . . . ,\n\nthe claimant knows that he has a present right to its return.\"\n\nSims, 376 F.3d at 708.            In this case, Santiago-Lugo had such\n\nknowledge at the time that judgment entered, notwithstanding the\n\ninadvertent omission of the forfeiture order.              As we stated in our\n\nJune 15, 2006 judgment affirming the district court's Rule 36\n\ncorrection of sentence, Santiago-Lugo had notice of the forfeiture\n\nwhen the preliminary and final orders of forfeiture entered (in\n\n1996).   Therefore, he was aware at least by October 1996 (when the\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\ffinal forfeiture order entered) of the seized items that were not\n\nforfeited, and could have asserted at that point his right to\n\nreturn of those items.\n\n            Santiago-Lugo also argues that he first filed his motion\n\nfor return of property on April 21, 1998, within the six-year\n\nstatute of limitations and that equitable tolling should apply to\n\npreserve his present claim.      Even if the April 1998 motion could be\n\nconstrued as a Rule 41 motion for returned of seized but not\n\nforfeited property, that motion was denied, as was Santiago-Lugo's\n\nmotion to reconsider.      And he did not appeal from those denials.\n\nEven   if   the   period   during    which   Santiago-Lugo    pursued   that\n\nchallenge to the seizure of his property tolled the limitations\n\nperiod, it would have tolled it only for three months, from April\n\n1998 when the motion was filed until July 1998, when the district\n\ncourt denied Santiago-Lugo's motion to reconsider.           That would not\n\nbe sufficient to extend the limitations period to July 2005.\n\nBecause we agree with the district court that the statute of\n\nlimitations bars Santiago-Lugo's Rule 41(g) claim, we do not reach\n\nthe substantive arguments that he makes in support of that claim.\n\n            The   government's      motion   for   summary   affirmance   is\n\ngranted. See 1st Cir. R. 27.0 (c).\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f",
