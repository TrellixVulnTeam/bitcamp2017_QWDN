Todd J. LaScola has appealed a district court\n\njudgment of default and the subsequent denial of his motion seeking\n\nto vacate that default judgment pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b).1\n\nWe review these rulings for abuse of discretion.                Teamsters Local\n\nNo. 59 v. Superline Transp. Co., Inc, 953 F.2d 17, 19 (1st Cir.\n\n1992).   Finding none, we affirm.\n\n     On appeal, LaScola reiterates his contention that his failure\n\ntimely to respond to the Department of Labor (DOL) complaint may be\n\nexcused by his preoccupation with his criminal case.                     LaScola\n\ncontends that the DOL sought an unfair advantage by filing its\n\ncivil action to coincide with the criminal proceeding, but he has\n\nshown    nothing     unfair   or    devious    about    the    timing.    While\n\nundoubtedly a distraction, the contemporaneous pendency of the\n\ncriminal proceeding, in and of itself, cannot relieve LaScola from\n\nresponsibility in answering the DOL civil suit.                LaScola provides\n\nno authority otherwise.       Further, he concedes that he was aware of\n\nthe civil action and was properly served with the complaint and\n\nsummons.      If the criminal action was adversely impacting his\n\nability to respond to the civil action, at the very least, LaScola\n\ncould have, and should have, sought an extension of time in which\n\nto respond to the DOL filing.                What he could not do without\n\nconsequence    was    to   simply    ignore    the     DOL    action.    LaScola\n\n\n\n     1\n      The default judgment also entered against LaScola's\ncompany, CPI Financial Services, Inc. LaScola's notices of\nappeal were filed solely on his own behalf.\n\n                                       -2-\n\facknowledges having discussed with Attorney O'Neil, who was then\n\nrepresenting him in the criminal case, the possibility that DOL\n\nwould file a civil action.           From aught that appears, LaScola\n\ndecided to rely on O'Neil's conjecture that a suit by DOL was of\n\nquestionable viability. That reliance apparently caused LaScola to\n\nsimply ignore the subsequently-filed action -- a risky and doubtful\n\ngamble which he lost. LaScola suggests a further factor mitigating\n\nin favor of vacating the default judgment is the failure to provide\n\nhim with notice of the default judgment hearing and subsequent\n\nfilings at his place of incarceration. But having failed to appear\n\nin the civil action, he was not entitled to service of such notice.\n\nTaylor v. Boston & Taunton Transp. Co., 720 F.2d 731, 733 (1st Cir.\n\n1983); Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(b)(2).\n\n     Even were LaScola's default determined to be a product of\n\nexcusable   neglect   so   as   to   justify   relief   pursuant   to   Rule\n\n60(b)(1), he has failed to demonstrate a potentially meritorious\n\ndefense. See Teamsters Local No. 59 v. Superline Transp. Co., Inc,\n\n953 F.2d at 20.       He provided no evidentiary support for his\n\ncontentions that his contract with the trustees of Local 99's Plan\n\nanticipated a performance based on a fixed income rate of return or\n\nthat the RBG commissions should not be included in the calculation\n\nof the opportunity losses.      Finally, the default judgment neither\n\nconstitutes a double recovery nor, in view of the DOL's concession\n\nthat LaScola would have a viable defense should the SEC actually\n\nreturn the commissions to the Plan, will there be a double recovery\n\n                                     -3-\n\fby the federal government.\n\n     In sum, there was no abuse of discretion in the district\n\ncourt's rulings and we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f",
