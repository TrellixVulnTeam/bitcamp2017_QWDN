The   states   and   the   federal\n\ngovernment have ongoing conflicts about the adequacy of federal\n\nlaws protecting against maritime oil spills.            Several states,\n\nincluding Massachusetts, have passed laws to protect particularly\n\nsensitive waterways.     The framework for analyzing such conflicts\n\nderives from the several preemption analyses set forth in United\n\nStates v. Locke, 529 U.S. 89 (2000), and Ray v. Atlantic Richfield\n\nCo., 435 U.S. 151 (1978).       In short, depending on the nature of\n\nstate and federal regulations, either field preemption, conflict\n\npreemption, or overlap analysis is used to determine whether state\n\nlaw impermissibly infringes on federal authority.\n\n            After a catastrophic oil spill in Buzzards Bay in 2003,\n\nthe Commonwealth of Massachusetts enacted the Massachusetts Oil\n\nSpill Prevention Act (MOSPA). See 2004 Mass. Acts 920 (codified as\n\namended primarily at Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21, §§ 42, 50B-50E, and\n\nch. 21M).    MOSPA imposes requirements designed to reduce the risk\n\nof oil spills, and to ensure that adequate resources are available\n\nto remedy such spills.\n\n            The United States sued Massachusetts on January 18, 2005,\n\nseeking to enjoin the enforcement of several MOSPA provisions. The\n\nUnited States alleged that these provisions were preempted by the\n\nPorts and Waterways Safety Act of 1972, Pub L. No. 92-340, 86 Stat.\n\n424, as amended by the Port and Tanker Safety Act of 1978, Pub. L.\n\nNo. 95-474, 92 Stat. 1471 (collectively, the \"PWSA\"), and by\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fregulations promulgated thereunder by the Coast Guard.1               This\n\nallegation   included   a   claim   that   MOSPA's   financial   assurance\n\nrequirement, which requires certain vessels to post a bond to\n\nensure their ability to respond financially to an oil spill, see\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 21, § 50C, was preempted by Title II of the\n\nPWSA, notwithstanding relevant savings clauses in the Oil Pollution\n\nAct of 1990 (\"OPA\"), Pub. L. No. 101-380, 104 Stat. 484, 505-06\n\n(codified at 33 U.S.C. § 2718).       The United States did not assert\n\nviolations of any treaties or claim that federal foreign affairs\n\npowers were at issue.2\n\n          The Commonwealth disputed each claim of preemption.           It\n\nargued that Congress had given the states leeway to regulate\n\nparticularly sensitive local waterways, at least in the absence of\n\nan actual conflict with a federal statute or regulation.           In the\n\nstate's view, there was no such conflict.\n\n          The district court, acting on the United States' motion\n\nfor judgment on the pleadings, and thus without taking evidence,\n\nentered judgment for plaintiffs and permanently enjoined all of the\n\n\n\n     1\n          The PWSA is codified at 33 U.S.C. §§ 1221-32 and in\nscattered sections of 46 U.S.C.\n     2\n          The United States also presented no claim that\nMassachusetts had limited the rights of non-residents and aliens to\nutilize its waters. Cf., e.g., Douglas v. Seacoast Prods., Inc.,\n431 U.S. 265, 283 (1977).         Nor did it assert that the\nConstitution's Admiralty Clause preempted the state statute. Cf.\nBallard Shipping Co. v. Beach Shellfish, 32 F.3d 623, 628-31 (1st\nCir. 1994).\n\n                                    -5-\n\fchallenged provisions.3        United States v. Massachusetts, 440 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 24, 48 (D. Mass. 2006).\n\n          The Commonwealth's appeal challenges the injunction only\n\ninsofar as it blocked three of MOSPA's provisions: an enhanced\n\nmanning requirement for tank barges and tow vessels in Buzzards\n\nBay, see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21M, § 4; a tug escort requirement for\n\nspecial interest waters, see id. § 6; and a requirement that\n\ncertain vessels obtain a certificate of financial assurance, the\n\namount of which can vary, see id. ch. 21, § 50C.\n\n          We   vacate    the   entry   of   judgment   and   the   permanent\n\ninjunction   for   the   United   States,   and   we   remand   for   further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.              As we explain, the\n\ndistrict court did not adhere to the analytical structure the\n\nSupreme Court has required to resolve federal-state conflicts in\n\nthis area.   The district court acted prematurely.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n          Several industry groups -- the American Waterways\nOperators, the International Association of Independent Tanker\nOwners, the Chamber of Shipping of America, and BIMCO -- intervened\non the side of the United States. The Coalition for Buzzards Bay\nintervened on the side of the Commonwealth. For ease of reference,\nwe will simply refer to the lead parties, the United States and\nMassachusetts.\n          On appeal, three sets of amici have filed briefs in\nsupport of Massachusetts: the \"state amici\" (which include the\nstates of Washington, Alaska, California, Maine, Oregon, and Rhode\nIsland, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico), the \"local government\namici\" (which include the towns of Bourne, Fairhaven, Falmouth,\nGosnold, Marion, and Westport, and the city of New Bedford), and\nthe Conservation Law Foundation.\n\n                                    -6-\n\f                         I.    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n            Buzzards Bay is one of five recognized Estuaries of\n\nNational Significance.        See 69 Fed. Reg. 62,427, 62,428 (Oct. 26,\n\n2004); see also 33 U.S.C. § 1330 (establishing a national estuary\n\nprogram).       Massachusetts has designated the Bay as part of an\n\n\"Ocean Sanctuary.\"     Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 132A, § 13(c).\n\n            Buzzards Bay is characterized by unusually dangerous\n\nledges, reefs, and currents.       Most of the Bay is less than 50 feet\n\ndeep, and the Bay is less than 8 miles wide.        See B. Howes et al.,\n\nEcology of Buzzards Bay: An Estuarine Profile 7, 23-24 (U.S. Dep't\n\nof the Interior, Biological Report No. 33, 1996), available at\n\nhttp://cuadra.cr.usgs.gov/Techrpt/96-33.pdf.         The Bay's Cape Cod\n\nCanal has unusually strong tidal currents, and it \"represents a\n\nsignificant navigational challenge.\"        Id. at 98.\n\n            Significant volumes of oil are transported through the\n\nBay and Canal each year.       In 2002, about 80% of the trips were made\n\nin single-hull barges.         71 Fed. Reg. 15,649, 15,650 (Mar. 29,\n\n2006).    In the state's view, the waters of Buzzards Bay are subject\n\nto a disproportionate and unnecessary risk of an oil spill.           A\n\nCoast Guard-sponsored report has concluded that \"the risk for oil\n\nor hazardous material discharge in Buzzards Bay is relatively\n\nhigh.\"    Id.\n\n            There have already been several damaging spills in the\n\nBay.     In 1969, roughly 175,000 gallons of No. 2 fuel oil spilled\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\finto the Bay after the barge Florida ran aground.              Id.   In 1974, a\n\nsizable amount of oil spilled from the Bouchard No. 65, inflicting\n\nsignificant damage on local marine life.            Howes et al., supra, at\n\n102-03.     In 1977, there was yet another Bouchard spill, this one\n\nreleasing 81,000 gallons of fuel oil into the water.              71 Fed. Reg.\n\nat 15,650.    In 1986, the tank barge ST-85 was grounded in the Bay,\n\nspilling 119,000 gallons of gasoline.4             Id.    In 1999, there was\n\nanother grounding, this one involving a vessel carrying 4.7 million\n\ngallons of No. 6 fuel oil.       Id.\n\n             Most recently, in April 2003 the barge Bouchard-120\n\nreleased an estimated 98,000 gallons of heavy fuel oil into the\n\nBay, killing hundreds of birds, closing thousands of acres of\n\nshellfish    beds,   affecting    over       90   miles   of   coastline,   and\n\ngenerating significant clean-up costs.5 Massachusetts responded by\n\nenacting MOSPA on August 4, 2004.            2004 Mass. Acts at 933.\n\n\n\n     4\n          In 1989, in nearby Narragansett Bay in Rhode Island, an\noil tanker ran aground and spilled over 300,000 gallons of heating\noil.    The responsible individuals pled guilty in criminal\nproceedings under the Clean Water Act, see 33 U.S.C. § 1319(c), and\nthey also agreed to pay fines, clean-up costs, and damages totaling\nover $9 million. See Ballard Shipping, 32 F.3d at 624.\n     5\n          The United States prosecuted the owner of the Bouchard-\n120 under the federal Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. §§ 1319(c)(1),\n1321(b)(3). The charge was negligent discharge of pollutant. The\noil barge, being towed by a tug boat, traveled outside the Buzzards\nBay channel and struck rocky shoals. The owner paid a fine of $10\nmillion, $7 million of which went to wetlands conservation\nprojects. The owner also pled guilty to violating the Migratory\nBird Treaty Act, see 16 U.S.C. §§ 703, 707(a), as the spill had\nkilled hundreds of federally protected birds.\n\n                                       -8-\n\f                    II.    DESCRIPTION OF FEDERAL LAW\n\nA.          Background\n\n            Federal regulation of maritime commerce has existed since\n\nthe founding of the country.               See Act of Sept. 1, 1789, ch. 11,\n\n§ 1, 1 Stat. 55. Federal regulation specifically geared toward the\n\ntransport of dangerous cargoes started with the Tank Vessel Act of\n\n1936, Pub. L. No. 74-765, 49 Stat. 1889.               See K. Brooks, California\n\nOil Spill Laws in the Wake of United States v. Locke, 12 U.S.F.\n\nMar. L.J. 227, 230 (1999-2000).              Regulatory involvement increased\n\nafter 1967, the year of a massive oil spill involving a supertanker\n\noff the coast of England.            Indeed, Congress has since enacted more\n\nstringent    legislation       for    oil    tankers    and   more   comprehensive\n\nremedies for oil spills.\n\n            The   PWSA    is   a     key    component    of   this   congressional\n\nresponse.    It has two titles, both or which are at issue here,\n\nwhich we describe in greater detail later.               Title I authorizes the\n\nCoast Guard to issue regulations on subjects within that title,\n\nalthough it does not so mandate.                 33 U.S.C. § 1223(a).    Title II\n\nworks differently; it requires the Coast Guard to issue federal\n\nregulations governing subjects covered by that title.                   46 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3703(a).\n\n            Several states have enacted statutes and regulations\n\ndesigned to give still greater protection against oil spills.                  The\n\nSupreme Court's 1978 decision in Ray concerned such state laws.\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\fRay    held    that     certain   provisions    of    a     Washington    statute\n\n(concerning tanker design, tanker size, and pilotage requirements\n\nfor enrolled vessels6) were preempted by federal law.               435 U.S. at\n\n159-60, 168, 178.        Ray did uphold Washington's limited tug escort\n\nrequirement for Puget Sound against a preemption challenge. Id. at\n\n173.\n\n              Despite    the   protections     of   the    PWSA,   in    1989   the\n\nsupertanker Exxon Valdez ran aground in Alaska, causing the largest\n\noil spill in United States history. The key congressional response\n\nwas the 1990 enactment of OPA.             OPA has nine titles, including\n\nprovisions imposing liability on parties responsible for damages\n\nand other costs stemming from oil spills.                 See 33 U.S.C. § 2702.\n\nTwo \"savings clauses\" in OPA's Title I expressly preserve and\n\nrecognize      state     authority    to     impose   additional         liability\n\nrequirements and penalties.          Id. § 2718(a)(1), (c).\n\n              The scope of these savings clauses was at issue in Locke.\n\nOn certiorari to the Supreme Court, the United States argued that\n\nseveral provisions of the Washington Administrative Code were\n\npreempted; the federal government stressed the foreign relations7\n\n\n       6\n          Enrolled vessels are those \"engaged in domestic or\ncoastwide trade or used for fishing.\" Douglas, 431 U.S. at 273.\n       7\n          The foreign governments of thirteen ocean-going nations\nexpressed concerns about the state scheme through a diplomatic note\nsent to the United States; that note was provided to the district\ncourt. The note protested that because there were inconsistencies\nbetween state and federal regulations regarding tanker personnel,\nequipment, and operations, permitting Washington's rules to take\n\n                                      -10-\n\fand international commerce aspects of the case. Locke, 529 U.S. at\n\n102-03.\n\n              Locke governs this case.           The distinctions that Locke\n\ndrew are the subject of dispute among the parties here.             Locke held\n\nthat several provisions of Washington's regulations were preempted\n\nby federal law.       Id. at 112-17.      The Locke Court held that PWSA's\n\nTitle II preempted three state regulations (requiring training for\n\ntanker crews, mandating English language proficiency, and imposing\n\na general statewide navigation-watch requirement).              Id. at 112-14.\n\nThe   Court    also   held   that   a   fourth    regulation    (governing   the\n\nreporting of marine casualties) was preempted by a different\n\nfederal statute, 46 U.S.C. § 6101.             Id. at 114-16.\n\n              Locke did not definitively rule on all of the regulations\n\nbefore it.       Instead, the Court remanded the issue of whether\n\ncertain regulations, such as the state's watch requirement in times\n\n\n\neffect would result in uncertainty and confusion. Locke, 529 U.S.\nat 98.\n           Locke thus presented issues regarding the need for\nnational uniformity for this country in the international\ncommunity.    Id. at 102-03; cf. Crosby v. Nat'l Foreign Trade\nCouncil, 530 U.S. 363, 373-74 (2000). The United States argued\nthat various treaties preempted Washington's regulations, including\nthe International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974,\n32 U.S.T. 47; the International Convention for Prevention of\nPollution from Ships, 1973, S. Exec. Doc. C, 93-1, 12 I.L.M. 1319,\nas amended by 1978 Protocol, S. Exec. Doc. C, 96-1, 17 I.L.M. 546;\nand the International Convention of Standards of Training,\nCertification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, with Annex, 1978\n(STCW), S. Exec. Doc. EE 96-1, C.T.I.A. No. 7624. Locke, 529 U.S.\n102-03. The Court did not reach the United States' arguments based\non these treaties and international agreements. Id. at 103.\n\n                                        -11-\n\fof restricted visibility, were of limited extraterritorial effect\n\nand were necessary to address the peculiarities of Puget Sound --\n\nfactors that would weigh in favor of a Title I conflict preemption\n\nanalysis rather than a Title II field preemption analysis.                    Id. at\n\n116-17.    The Court stated that the resolution of these matters\n\nwould benefit from a full development of the record, noting that\n\nthe United States did not enter the case until appeal.                  Id.\n\n            For    our    purposes,     Locke    established       a   number    of\n\nsignificant rules. Locke held that OPA's savings clauses preserved\n\nonly \"state laws of a scope similar to the matters contained in\n\nTitle I of OPA,\" id. at 105, and did not constitute a reversal of\n\nRay's preemption rules as to Title I and Title II of the PWSA, id.\n\nat 105-07.        Rather, OPA only preserved state authority in the\n\nlimited area of establishing liability rules and imposing financial\n\nrequirements regarding oil spills.8             Id. at 105.\n\n            Locke also rejected the use of general presumptions,\n\neither for or against preemption, and instead called for close\n\nanalysis of the federal statutory structure.                  Locke expressly\n\nrepudiated any notion, which might have survived Ray, that there is\n\nany presumption of non-preemption of state rules.                  Id. at 107-08.\n\nLocke    pointed    out   that   the   federal    interest    in    national    and\n\n\n\n     8\n          Earlier, in Askew v. American Waterways Operators, Inc.,\n411 U.S. 325 (1973), the Court had sustained, against a maritime\nlaw preemption challenge, a state statute imposing strict liability\nfor oil spills. Id. at 327-29.\n\n                                       -12-\n\finternational maritime commerce was one of the reasons cited in the\n\nFederalist Papers for adopting the Constitution, and the Court\n\ndetailed the numerous federal statutes and treaties in the area.\n\nId. at 99-103, 108.       At the same time, however, Locke did not put\n\nin   place    the    opposite   presumption,    a   presumption   favoring\n\npreemption.     Rather, the validity of state regulation must be\n\njudged against the \"federal statutory structure.\"            Id. at 108.\n\nIndeed, \"[n]o artificial presumption aids us in determining the\n\nscope of appropriate local regulation under the PWSA.\"            Id.; see\n\nalso P. Gudridge, Comment, United States v. Locke, 120 S. Ct. 1135,\n\n94 Am. J. Int'l L. 745, 748 (2000).\n\n             Locke    reinforced   Ray's   two-category     approach    to\n\npreemption: either field preemption or conflict preemption is to be\n\nused.     Locke, 529 U.S. at 109-11.           Locke also went further,\n\nrecognizing that it would not always be clear which of the two\n\nmodels would apply.       It added a new overlap analysis to resolve\n\nthat question.       See id. at 112.\n\n             Field preemption applies to state law on subjects which\n\nare within the province of Title II of the PWSA.          Id. at 110-11.\n\nOther sources of federal maritime regulation may also preempt state\n\nlaw, even if the state law is consistent with federal law.          Id. at\n\n114-16.\n\n             By contrast, Locke held that conflict preemption applies\n\nto state regulations within the scope of Title I.          Title I of the\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\fPWSA does not expressly preserve state power (unlike OPA).      But\n\nTitle I also does not preempt with the same force as Title II.\n\nRather, state law in areas within the province of Title I are\n\nsubject to standard conflict preemption analysis, primarily the\n\nmodel which the Court has utilized in Commerce Clause cases.    Id.\n\nat 109-10; see also Bethlehem Steel Co. v. N.Y. State Labor\n\nRelations Bd., 330 U.S. 767, 773-74 (1947) (discussing federal\n\npreemption of state regulation in the Commerce Clause context).\n\n          Locke's conflict preemption analysis involves an initial\n\ninquiry into whether federal authority has been exercised through\n\na regulation intended to displace state law, or by a federal\n\ndecision of the Coast Guard that there should be no regulation of\n\nthe subject in question.    529 U.S. at 109-10.   A conflict arises\n\n\"when compliance with both state and federal law is impossible, or\n\nwhen the state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and\n\nexecution of the full purposes and objective of Congress.\"   Id. at\n\n109 (quoting California v. ARC Am. Corp., 490 U.S. 93, 100-101\n\n(1989)) (internal quotation marks omitted).       \"In this context,\n\nCoast Guard regulations are to be given pre-emptive effect over\n\nconflicting state laws.\"9   Id. at 109-10.\n\n\n     9\n          State laws can be preempted by federal regulations as\nwell as by federal statutes. City of New York v. FCC, 486 U.S. 57,\n63-64 (1988); Hillsborough County v. Automated Med. Labs., Inc.,\n471 U.S. 707, 713 (1985).        When the Coast Guard makes a\ndetermination not to impose a regulation, this may amount to a\ndecision that no regulation at either the state or federal level is\nappropriate. See Ark. Elec. Coop. Corp. v. Ark. Pub. Serv. Comm'n,\n\n                                -14-\n\f          Overlap analysis applies when a state law falls within\n\nthe overlapping coverage of Title I and Title II.   We describe that\n\noverlap analysis below.\n\nB.        Title I, Title II, and Overlap Analysis\n\n          The respective scopes of Title I and Title II play a\n\ncrucial role in any preemption analysis under the PWSA.        This\n\nnecessitates a more detailed discussion of these provisions.\n\n          Congress has, by statute, occupied the field with respect\n\nto subject matters addressed in Title II of the PWSA.10 The subject\n\nmatter of Title II, \"Vessels Carrying Certain Cargoes in Bulk,\" is\n\ngenerally defined at 46 U.S.C. § 3703(a):\n\n          The Secretary shall prescribe regulations for\n          the design, construction, alteration, repair,\n          maintenance, operation, equipping, personnel\n          qualification, and manning of vessels to which\n          this chapter applies, that may be necessary\n          for increased protection against hazards to\n\n\n461 U.S. 375, 384 (1983); Ray, 435 U.S. at 171-72.    However, a\ndecision by the Coast Guard not to regulate in a field does not\nnecessarily mean that the Coast Guard intended to preempt state\nlaw. See Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, 537 U.S. 51, 65-67 (2002).\n     10\n          Other sources of federal maritime law may also preempt\nstate regulation by occupying the field. This is true even if the\nstate requirements are very similar to federal requirements. For\nexample, Locke held that Washington's marine casualty reporting\nrequirement was preempted, despite its similarity to federal\nrequirements, because \"Congress intended that the Coast Guard\nregulations [under 46 U.S.C. § 6101] be the sole source of a\nvessel's reporting obligations.\" 529 U.S. at 115. The state's\nreporting requirement created a significant burden in terms of\ncosts, posed a risk of innocent non-compliance, and affected a\nvessel operator's out-of-state obligations and conduct -- factors\nwhich called into question the state's authority to regulate. Id.\nat 116.\n\n                               -15-\n\f           life and property, for navigation and vessel\n           safety, and for enhanced protection of the\n           marine environment.\n\nCongress has required the Coast Guard to issue regulations under\n\nTitle II, which \"shall include requirements about . . . (3)\n\nequipment and appliances for . . . prevention and mitigation of\n\ndamage to the marine environment; [and] (4) the manning of vessels\n\nand the duties, qualifications, and training of the officers and\n\ncrew.\"   46 U.S.C. § 3703(a).\n\n           By contrast, conflict preemption is applied to state\n\nstatutes and regulations concerning subject matters within Title I\n\nof the PWSA.   See Locke, 529 U.S. at 109.     The subject matter of\n\nTitle I is defined by statute:\n\n           Subject to the requirements of section 1224 of\n           this title, the Secretary --\n\n           (1)   in  any   port   or   place  under   the\n           jurisdiction of the United States, in the\n           navigable waters of the United States, or in\n           any area covered by an international agreement\n           negotiated pursuant to section 1230 of this\n           title, may construct, operate, maintain,\n           improve, or expand vessel traffic services,\n           consisting of measures for controlling or\n           supervising vessel traffic or for protecting\n           navigation and the marine environment and may\n           include, but need not be limited to one or\n           more of the following: reporting and operating\n           requirements, surveillance and communications\n           systems, routing systems, and fairways . . . .\n\n33   U.S.C. § 1223(a).   As the United States has stated, the subject\n\nmatter of Title I is characterized generally by matters of local\n\nconcern, and, absent issuance of federal regulations or a decision\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\fnot to allow state regulation under Title I, state regulation is\n\nnot preempted in areas subject to that title.\n\n           Title I and Title II overlap in some instances.                   For\n\nexample, both titles cover, in different contexts, \"operating\"\n\nrequirements.    See id. § 1223(a)(1) (Secretary may impose measures\n\nincluding,      inter     alia,        \"operating       requirements\");      id.\n\n§   1223(a)(4)(D)     (Secretary      may   \"restrict[]   operation,   in    any\n\nhazardous area or under hazardous conditions, to vessels which have\n\nparticular   operating    characteristics        or   capabilities   which   he\n\nconsiders necessary for safe operation under the circumstances\");\n\n46 U.S.C. § 3703(a) (requiring Secretary to \"prescribe regulations\n\nfor the . . . operation . . . and manning of vessels to which this\n\nchapter applies\"); see also Locke, 529 U.S. at 116 (remanding for\n\nconsideration    of   whether     a   state   navigation-watch    requirement\n\nshould be analyzed under Title I conflict preemption or Title II\n\nfield preemption).      Further, each title purports to have as one of\n\nits purposes the protection of the environment.                See 33 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1223(a)(1) (authorizing regulations on covered subjects \"for\n\nprotecting    navigation        and     the    marine     environment\");     46\n\nU.S.C. § 3703(a) (requiring regulations on covered subjects \"that\n\nmay be necessary . . . for enhanced protection of the marine\n\nenvironment\").\n\n           As a result, Locke recognized that \"[t]he existence of\n\nsome overlapping coverage between the two titles of the PWSA may\n\n\n                                       -17-\n\fmake it difficult to determine whether a pre-emption question is\n\ncontrolled by conflict pre-emption principles, applicable generally\n\nto Title I, or by field pre-emption rules, applicable generally to\n\nTitle II.\"       529 U.S. at 111.      In such instances of overlap, not\n\nevery question will be resolved \"by the greater pre-emptive force\n\nof Title II.\"       Id.   Rather, \"conflict pre-emption under Title I\n\nwill be applicable in some, although not all, cases.\"              Id. at 111-\n\n12.\n\n            In resolving preemption questions in cases of overlapping\n\ncoverage, Locke instructs courts to consider these factors11: (1)\n\n\"the type of regulations the Secretary has actually promulgated\n\nunder [Title II]\"; (2) whether the regulation falls within the\n\nspecific type listed in § 3703(a) as required to be promulgated;\n\n(3) whether the federal rule is \"justified by conditions unique to\n\na particular port or waterway\" (e.g., a Title I regulation based on\n\nwater depth in Puget Sound or other local peculiarities); (4)\n\nwhether    the   state    regulation    is    \"of   limited   extraterritorial\n\neffect, not requiring the tanker to modify its primary conduct\n\noutside the specific body of water purported to justify the local\n\nrule\"; and (5) whether the state regulation is one that \"pose[s] a\n\nminimal risk of innocent noncompliance, do[es] not affect vessel\n\n\n      11\n          These factors are drawn from themes identified in other\nSupreme Court cases.   \"Whether federal [regulation] operates to\npreempt state regulation will ordinarily depend on the respective\naims of the state and federal schemes.\"       L. Tribe, American\nConstitutional Law § 6-28, at 506-07 (2d ed. 1988).\n\n                                       -18-\n\foperations outside the jurisdiction, do[es] not require adjustment\n\nof   systemic    aspects    of     the   vessel,    and   do[es]     not   impose   a\n\nsubstantial burden on the vessel's operation within the local\n\njurisdiction itself.\"        Id. at 112.\n\n           In     the    same    vein,     Ray     instructed    federal     courts\n\naddressing      such    maritime    environmental      cases    to   look   to   the\n\nrespective purposes of the federal and state laws.                     435 U.S. at\n\n164-65.    This \"purpose\" rule emerged from earlier Supreme Court\n\nCommerce Clause cases such as Huron Portland Cement Co. v. City of\n\nDetroit, 362 U.S. 440 (1960), and Kelly v. Washington, 302 U.S. 1\n\n(1937).12 Overlap analysis thus involves some identification of the\n\nrelative purposes and domains of Title I and Title II.                           See\n\nMedtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U.S. 470, 484 (1996) (stressing the\n\n\n      12\n          In Huron, the Court found that the state law at issue was\nnot preempted; in doing so the Court contrasted the purpose of\nfederal inspection laws, which sought \"to insure the seagoing\nsafety of vessels subject to inspection,\" with the purpose of a\nDetroit ordinance, which sought to eliminate air pollution \"to\nprotect the health and enhance the cleanliness of the local\ncommunity.\" 362 U.S. at 445-46. In Kelly, the Court similarly\nupheld state legislation concerning motor-driven tugs, and it\nconsidered the state law's purpose of insuring safety and\ndetermining seaworthiness. 302 U.S. at 8, 14-16.\n          \"[T]he principles developed [under Commerce Clause\npreemption] are not limited to [that] context; essentially the same\ntechniques are used to determine the consequences for state action\nof any exercise of a plenary federal authority.\" Tribe, supra,\n§ 6-29, at 508. Nonetheless, there are some distinctions between\nCommerce Clause preemption rules and maritime preemption rules.\nSee Am. Dredging Co. v. Miller, 510 U.S. 443, 452 n.3 (1994)\n(distinguishing \"negative Commerce Clause\" jurisprudence, and\ncommenting that \"[w]hatever might be the unifying theme of this\naspect of our admiralty jurisprudence, it assuredly is not . . .\nthe principle that the States may not impair maritime commerce\").\n\n                                         -19-\n\fneed to identify the \"domain\" of the statutory clause said to\n\npreempt state law).          Ray appeared to consider Title II to be\n\nconcerned with matters that are properly subject to national rules,\n\nsee 435 U.S. at 165-66 & n.15, while Title I is more concerned with\n\nrules \"arising from the peculiarities of local waters that call for\n\nspecial precautionary measures,\"13         id. at 171.\n\n            Against   this    background,   we   turn    to   the   preemption\n\nanalysis of the specific MOSPA sections.\n\n          III.   VESSEL MANNING REQUIREMENTS FOR BUZZARDS BAY\n\n            The district court held that the two vessel manning\n\nrequirements of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21M, § 4 -- for tank barges and\n\nfor tow vessels in Buzzards Bay -- are field preempted because they\n\nare unambiguously covered by Title II, and not Title I.                    The\n\n\n\n     13\n            As another commentator has noted:\n\n            Whether preemption is to turn on an overlap of\n            \"subject,\" \"object\" or \"purpose,\" or on\n            interference with \"federal superintendence of\n            the field,\" is crucial to the analysis.\n            Virtually every state regulation of merchant\n            vessel safety can also be characterized as\n            having a \"pollution prevention\" purpose.\n            Thus, federal legislation on the subject of\n            vessel construction, design, equipment, and\n            manning . . ., but having, by the court's\n            characterization,   a   purpose   other   than\n            pollution prevention, would not occupy the\n            field of pollution prevention addressed by the\n            challenged state law.\n\nC. Allen, Federalism in the Era of International Standards:\nFederal and State Government Regulation of Merchant Vessels in the\nUnited States (Part III), 30 J. Mar. L. & Com. 85, 94 (1999).\n\n                                    -20-\n\fdistrict court did not engage in the overlap analysis described in\n\nLocke.    See Massachusetts, 440 F. Supp. 2d at 35-37.       The United\n\nStates did not seriously present argument to the district court\n\nthat if Title I applied, federal regulations preempted the vessel\n\nmanning requirements.\n\n           Subject to certain exceptions,14 the state's manning\n\nprovision for \"tank barges\" requires that crews consist of \"2\n\npersonnel, 1 of whom shall be a certified tanker-man under [federal\n\nregulations] who shall be on the tank barge at all times.\"        Mass.\n\nGen. Laws ch. 21M, § 4(b).   The manning provision for \"tow vessels\"\n\ntowing 6000 or more barrels of oil requires (a) \"at least 1\n\nlicensed deck officer or tow vessel operator, who shall serve\n\nexclusively as a lookout with no other concurrent duties,\" and (b)\n\n\"three licensed officers or tow vessel operators.\"        Id. § 4(a).\n\n           The parties raise different preemption arguments for\n\nsection 4(b), the tank barge provision, and for section 4(a), the\n\ntow vessel provision.\n\nA.         The Section 4(b)    Tank    Barge   Manning   Requirement    in\n           Buzzards Bay\n\n           Massachusetts argues that although section (4)(b)'s tank\n\nbarge manning requirement could be encompassed by Title II,       there\n\nis nonetheless overlap with Title I.     Because of this overlap, the\n\n\n     14\n          Section 4(b) exempts barges that carry less than 6000\ngallons of oil, as well as barges that are not equipped to carry\npersonnel on board.   Section 4(c) additionally exempts double-\nhulled barges from the requirements of section 4(b).\n\n                                -21-\n\fstate contends that more facts needed to be developed, and so the\n\nissue should not have been resolved at the pleadings stage.\n\n           The United States disagrees, arguing that because \"the\n\nmanning   of   vessels\"   is   listed   in   Title   II,15   see   46   U.S.C.\n\n§ 3703(a)(4), all state manning regulations are field preempted by\n\nTitle II and no overlap analysis is necessary.               That contention\n\noverreaches. The position of the United States, which the district\n\ncourt accepted, is inconsistent with Locke's recognition that Title\n\nI and Title II can overlap.      See 529 U.S. at 111.\n\n           While the district court was correct to begin with the\n\ntext of the Title II, this should not have ended the inquiry.\n\nTitle II of the PWSA addresses the \"manning of vessels to which\n\nthis chapter applies,\" 46 U.S.C. § 3703(a), and the chapter applies\n\nto \"tank vessels,\" see id. § 3702(a).          A tank vessel is in turn\n\ndefined as\n\n           a vessel that is constructed or adapted to\n           carry, or that carries, oil or hazardous\n           material in bulk as cargo or cargo residue,\n           and that -- (A) is a vessel of the United\n           States; (B) operates on the navigable waters\n           of the United States; or (C) transfers oil or\n           hazardous material in a port or place subject\n           to the jurisdiction of the United States.\n\n\n\n     15\n          The Coast Guard has in fact promulgated regulations\nrequiring tankers to \"navigate with at least two licensed deck\nofficers on watch . . ., one of whom may be a pilot. In waters\nwhere a pilot is required, the second officer . . . must be an\nindividual licensed and assigned to the vessel as master, mate, or\nofficer in charge of a navigational watch,\" separate from the\npilot. 33 C.F.R. § 164.13(c).\n\n                                   -22-\n\fId. § 2101(39).           Congress required the Coast Guard to promulgate\n\nregulations addressing \"the manning of [tank] vessels and the\n\nduties, qualifications, and training of the officers and crew.\"\n\nId. § 3703(a)(4).\n\n           Courts         must   also    examine    the   text    of    Title    I    when\n\nanalyzing the preemptive effect of the PWSA on particular state\n\nregulations.        See Locke, 529 U.S. at 111-12.              As the state points\n\nout,   Title    I        gives   the    Secretary     authority        to     promulgate\n\nregulations     for       protecting     the    marine    environment,        which   may\n\ninclude   \"operating         requirements.\"          33    U.S.C.      §    1223(a)(1).\n\nFurther, for areas the Secretary considers to be hazardous, the\n\nSecretary may establish \"vessel operating conditions\" and/or may\n\nrestrict operations to \"vessels which have particular operating\n\ncharacteristics or capabilities which he considers necessary for\n\nsafe operation.\"          Id. § 1223(a)(4)(C), (D).            The state argues that\n\nits manning requirements are thus a type of operational requirement\n\nunder Title I, for certain vessels in Buzzards Bay, and not a\n\ngeneral manning requirement under Title II.\n\n           The United States responds that the phrase \"operating\n\nrequirements\" is a term of art that refers only to navigational\n\noperations     in    a    traffic      safety   system    of    the    type   expressly\n\naddressed in Title I of the PWSA.                   The general operation and\n\nmanning of vessels, the United States says, are dealt with in Title\n\nII and are thus field preempted.                See 46 U.S.C. § 3703(a).\n\n\n                                          -23-\n\f            As the state notes, however, Title I's Statement of\n\nPolicy also refers to \"manning\": \"The Congress finds and declares\n\n. . . that increased supervision of vessel . . . operations is\n\nnecessary in order to . . . insure that vessels operating in the\n\nnavigable    waters    of   the   United   States   shall    comply    with   all\n\napplicable standards and requirements for vessel construction,\n\nequipment,     manning,     and   operational   procedures.\"          33   U.S.C.\n\n§ 1221(c)(3) (emphases added).         Analysis of the texts of Title I\n\nand Title II does not fully resolve the source of the potential\n\npreemption here.       Nor does initial consideration of the purposes\n\nbehind Title I and Title II resolve the matter.               Both Titles are\n\nconcerned with enhanced protection of the marine environment.                 See\n\nLocke, 529 U.S. at 110-11.        As a result, that cannot itself be the\n\ndistinguishing factor.        Nor is it helpful to talk abstractly about\n\nthe   safety    of    vessels,    which,    depending   on    the     particular\n\nregulations at issue, may be a Title I or a Title II concern.\n\n            The analysis becomes clearer when one considers Locke's\n\napproach.      The    Court   invalidated    training   requirements        which\n\napplied statewide, controlled manning outside of state waters, and\n\ndid not address \"matters unique to the waters of Puget Sound.\"                Id.\n\nat 113. The Court also invalidated an English language proficiency\n\nrequirement for tanker crews that affected staffing decisions\n\noutside of state waters and was \"not limited to governing local\n\n\n                                     -24-\n\ftraffic or local peculiarities.\"             Id. at 113-14.       Further, the\n\nCourt invalidated as field preempted a statewide navigation-watch\n\nrequirement. The Court noted that this was a general operation and\n\nmanning requirement under Title II because \"[t]he general watch\n\nrequirement is not tied to the peculiarities of Puget Sound; it\n\napplies throughout Washington's waters and at all times.\"               Id. at\n\n114.    Locke thus held that the state's general watch regulation --\n\nrequiring at least four specified personnel in state waters at all\n\ntimes -- was preempted by Title II as an attempt to regulate a\n\ntanker's \"operation\" and \"manning\" under 46 U.S.C. § 3703(a).                Id.\n\n              However,   at   the   same    time,   the   Court   remanded   for\n\nperformance of an overlap analysis to determine whether a narrower\n\nnavigation-watch requirement, for times of restricted visibility,\n\nshould be analyzed under Title I.               In line with the Court's\n\narticulation of the method for differentiating between Title I and\n\nTitle    II    concerns,      the   Court    suggested    that,    on   remand,\n\nconsideration should be given to Washington's arguments that the\n\nnarrower requirement was \"of limited extraterritorial effect and\n\nnecessary to address the peculiarities of Puget Sound.\"                 Id. at\n\n116.\n\n              Relying on this aspect of Locke, the state suggests that\n\nany time a state regulation on a given topic is restricted to a\n\nparticular local waterway, overlap analysis is required.                     This\n\nargument stretches too far and is inconsistent with the balance of\n\n\n                                      -25-\n\fLocke as well as Ray.       Some topics are Title II topics, regardless\n\nof limited geographic application, as the state has essentially\n\nconceded in not attempting to defend other sections of its statute.\n\nWith regard to the manning requirement before us, however, the\n\ndistrict court must undertake an overlap inquiry, including a full\n\nconsideration of the various Locke factors. Further development of\n\nthe record is in order to resolve this point.\n\n            The United States suggests to us that even if Title I\n\nconflict    preemption      analysis     were     used,   various     federal\n\nrequirements    in   the    area   of    manning,    including   regulations\n\npromulgated under Title I, suffice to preempt.                See, e.g., 33\n\nC.F.R. § 164.13(c).        The argument has not been sufficiently made\n\neither before the district court or on appeal, and can be made on\n\nremand.\n\nB.          The Section 4(a)       Tow   Vessel     Manning   Requirement   in\n            Buzzards Bay\n\n            We have concluded that the state's tank barge manning\n\nrequirements for Buzzards Bay must be reconsidered under overlap\n\nanalysis.    For similar reasons, we also conclude that a remand is\n\nnecessary on the state's tow vessel manning provisions.\n\n            The state nonetheless asks us to go farther.            It points\n\nout that the text of Title II addresses \"tank vessels,\" not \"tow\n\nvessels,\" see 46 U.S.C. § 3702(a), and it contends that the two are\n\n\n\n\n                                    -26-\n\fnot the same.16        Accordingly, the state argues that section 4(a)\n\ncannot be within the scope of Title II, and the provision's\n\nvalidity     must   instead      be    considered    under    Title    I   conflict\n\npreemption analysis.\n\n             The United States disagrees with this interpretation of\n\nthe PWSA.      It argues that although the PWSA expressly addresses\n\n\"tank vessels,\" and not \"tow vessels,\" that fact is immaterial.\n\nThe definition of \"tank vessel\" includes any vessel that \"carries\n\n. . . oil or hazardous material in bulk as cargo,\" and not just\n\nvessels that are \"constructed or adapted to carry . . . oil or\n\nhazardous material in bulk as cargo.\"                  Id. § 2101(39).         That\n\ndefinition, in the United States' view, can encompass a tug vessel\n\nwhen    it   pushes,    pulls,    or    hauls   a   vessel    containing    oil   or\n\nhazardous material (although the vessel would not be within the\n\nscope of the definition when it carries some other type of cargo).\n\nThis interpretation is based on an argument that when a vessel\n\ncarrying oil or other hazardous material is not self-propelled and\n\nrequires a tug (as would be the case with a barge), the tug and the\n\nnon-self-propelled       vessel       effectively    become    one    vessel   which\n\n\"carries\" the cargo.\n\n\n\n\n       16\n          A \"towing vessel\" is \"a commercial vessel engaged in or\nintending to engage in the service of pulling, pushing, or hauling\nalong side, or any combination of pulling, pushing, or hauling\nalong side.\" 46 U.S.C. § 2101(40).\n\n                                         -27-\n\f            The state responds that a 2004 amendment added \"towing\n\nvessels\" to the list of vessels covered by a separate chapter of\n\nTitle 46 of the United States Code, but did not similarly add\n\n\"towing vessels\" to the list of vessels covered by Title II of the\n\nPWSA.     See Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2004,\n\nPub. L. No. 108-293, § 415, 118 Stat. 1028, 1047 (codified at 46\n\nU.S.C. § 3301(15)).      The amended section already applied to \"tank\n\nvessels.\"    46 U.S.C. § 3301(10).     The state argues that this means\n\nthe term \"tank vessel\" does not encompass towing vessels.\n\n            The district court held that although Title II does not\n\nexpressly    use   the   term   \"tow   vessels,\"   this   was   a   legally\n\ninsignificant distinction.      Massachusetts, 440 F. Supp. 2d at 36-\n\n37.     The district court adopted the United States' argument that\n\n\"towing vessels that are pushing, pulling, or hauling tank barges\n\ncarrying oil or other hazardous materials are, as part of the\n\ntow-barge combination, 'tank vessels' and are, thus, within the\n\nscope of Title II.\"      Id. at 37.\n\n            The court explained that adoption of the state's proposed\n\ndistinction between tank vessels and tow vessels would undermine\n\nimportant federal interests:\n\n            The towing vessel, although it does not\n            physically carry the oil, is the crucial\n            element of the tow-barge combination and,\n            therefore, poses the most risk to the marine\n            environment.      Defendants'      ar gument,\n            furthermore, would give the Coast Guard\n            exclusive jurisdiction to regulate one form of\n            tank vessel, self-propelled tankers, but would\n\n                                   -28-\n\f           grant concurrent jurisdiction with the states\n           to regulate the driving force of the tow-tank\n           barge combination. That result would make\n           little practical sense and would hinder the\n           Congressional   goal   of  creating   uniform\n           national regulations for all tank vessels.\n\nId.   This led the court to hold that the matter was clearly within\n\nTitle II, and so section 4(a) was field preempted.     Id.\n\n           Our resolution of this appeal does not require us to\n\ndetermine if the state or the federal government has correctly\n\ninterpreted the meaning of 'tank vessel.'       Even if the federal\n\ngovernment's interpretation is correct, our discussion in Part\n\nIII.A shows why overlap analysis would still be required before a\n\ncourt could find preemption as a matter of law.    That is sufficient\n\nfor us to reverse the district court's decision to grant judgment\n\non the pleadings, and to remand this issue.17\n\n\n      17\n          We call the parties' attention to 33 C.F.R. § 138.20.\nSection 138.20 was not promulgated under Title II, but instead\nunder both OPA and the Comprehensive Environmental Response,\nCompensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA).       The regulation's\ndefinition of \"tank vessel\" clearly excludes tow vessels:\n\n           Tank vessel means a vessel (other than . . . a\n           towing or pushing vessel (tug) simply because\n           it has in its custody a tank barge) that is\n           constructed or adapted to carry, or that\n           carries, oil or liquid hazardous material in\n           bulk as cargo or cargo residue, and that --\n\n           (1) Is a vessel of the United States;\n\n           (2) Operates on the navigable waters; or\n\n           (3) Transfers oil or hazardous material in a\n           place subject to the jurisdiction of the\n           United States.\n\n                                -29-\n\f                   IV.   TUG ESCORT REQUIREMENTS\n\n          The United States argues that the state's tug escort\n\nprovisions, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21M, § 6, are in conflict with\n\nregulations   promulgated    under     Title   I,   see   33   C.F.R.\n\n§ 165.100(d)(1). The asserted conflict is that the Coast Guard has\n\nmade a preemptive choice in these regulations that tug escort\n\nrequirements be set by the Coast Guard on a regional basis,\n\ncovering all of the First Coast Guard District.18\n\n          The state tug escort statute has three key provisions.\n\nIt applies only to \"area[s] of special interest within the waters\n\nof the commonwealth,\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21M, § 6(a), which\n\ninclude Buzzards Bay, Vineyard Sound, and Mount Hope Bay,19 id. § 1.\n\nFurther, the statute prohibits a tank vessel carrying 6000 or more\n\nbarrels of oil from entering or transiting such waters unless the\n\n\n\n33 C.F.R. § 138.20(b). With the exception of the parenthetical\nclause, this definition is nearly identical to the Title II\ndefinition of \"tank vessel\" found at 46 U.S.C. § 2101(39).     We\nleave the significance, if any, of this textual difference to the\npreemption analysis to the district court in the first instance.\n     18\n          The First Coast Guard District is comprised of Maine, New\nHampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and\nparts of New York and New Jersey. 33 C.F.R. § 3.05-1(b).\n     19\n          The statute also permits the state Secretary of\nEnvironmental Affairs to expand the definition to include other\nwaters which meet particular criteria. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\n21M, § 1. Further, section 6(c) permits the state commissioner to\npromulgate certain regulations.     This case is confined to the\nfacial constitutionality of the cited statutory provisions. No\nstate regulations are at issue here, nor are any bodies of water\nimplicated other than the three specifically listed in the statute.\n\n                                -30-\n\ftank vessel is accompanied by a tugboat escort.        Id. § 6(a).\n\nFinally, the section does not apply to a self-propelled tank\n\nvessel.   Id. § 6(b).\n\n           The United States makes two preliminary arguments that we\n\nquickly reject. First, the United States attempts to redefine what\n\nis meant by conflict preemption in the Title I context.   It argues\n\nthat once the Coast Guard promulgates regulations on a subject,\n\nthat ends the matter; there is essentially no room for any further\n\npreemption analysis.    For example, the United States argues that\n\n\"State regulatory authority does not survive once the Secretary\n\nestablishes federal regulations under Title I.\"20      The argument\n\noverreaches.21\n\n\n     20\n           The district court's decision could be read to have\nadopted the United States' position: \"In this case, the Coast Guard\nhas regulated on the challenged subject. This court, therefore,\nneed   not   [delve   further  into   the   Title   I   analysis].\"\nMassachusetts, 440 F. Supp. 2d at 42.\n     21\n          The United States relies primarily on Ray to argue that\nwhen the federal government adopts a regulation covering an area\nwithin the scope of Title I, state regulation on the same subject\nis preempted.   It is true that Ray stated that \"[t]he relevant\ninquiry under Title I with respect to the State's power to impose\na tug-escort rule is thus whether the Secretary has either\npromulgated his own tug requirement for [local] tanker navigation\nor has decided that no such requirement should be imposed at all.\"\n435 U.S. at 171-72.    On this record, however, neither of those\npremises is demonstrated.\n          We also note that Title I has changed since Ray, another\nissue that should be addressed on remand. At the time of the Ray\ndecision, 33 U.S.C. § 1222(b) had provided: \"Nothing contained in\nthis chapter [referring to Title I of the PWSA] . . . prevent[s] a\nState or political subdivision thereof from prescribing for\nstructures only higher safety equipment requirements or safety\nstandards than those which may be prescribed pursuant to this\n\n                                -31-\n\f           As pointed out by the state amici, the position of the\n\nUnited States converts Locke's Title I conflict preemption analysis\n\ninto something resembling a field preemption analysis.            The United\n\nStates' argument largely destroys the distinction between the two\n\npreemption models set forth in Locke, 529 U.S. at 109-10, as\n\ndiscussed above.\n\n           Perhaps the United States means only that if the Coast\n\nGuard   Title    I   regulations   had   expressly    preempted    the   state\n\nstatute, courts would view the matter under a different model.              An\n\nagency's preemption judgment is \"dispositive on the question of\n\nimplicit intent to pre-empt unless either the agency's position is\n\ninconsistent     with   clearly    expressed   congressional      intent,   or\n\nsubsequent      developments   reveal    a   change   in   that   position.\"\n\nHillsborough County v. Automated Med. Labs., Inc., 471 U.S. 707,\n\n\nchapter.\"   33 U.S.C. § 1222(b) (1976) (emphases added).        Ray\nreasoned that since § 1222(b) permitted states to impose higher\nsafety standards only for \"structures,\" this \"impliedly forb[ade]\nhigher state standards for vessels.\" Ray, 435 U.S. at 174. The\nCourt thus held that \"the State may not impose higher safety\nstandards than those prescribed by the Secretary [limiting the size\nof vessels in Puget Sound].\" Id. at 175.\n          The language pertaining to higher state safety standards\nno longer appears at § 1222. In 1978, Congress amended Title I,\ndeleting any mention of state safety standards from § 1222, and\ninstead adding a different provision to § 1225. Port and Tanker\nSafety Act of 1978, § 2, 92 Stat. at 1471-75.        Section 1225,\nentitled \"Waterfront safety,\" now provides: \"Nothing contained in\nthis section, with respect to structures, prohibits a State or\npolitical subdivision thereof from prescribing higher safety\nequipment requirements or safety standards than those which may be\nprescribed by [federal] regulations . . . .\" 33 U.S.C. § 1225(b)\n(emphases added). Again, we leave the significance of this change\nto the district court on remand.\n\n                                     -32-\n\f714-15 (1985) (citation omitted).     Nonetheless, judicial review of\n\nthat judgment would still be available.       See City of New York v.\n\nFCC, 486 U.S. 57, 63-64 (1988).     A court would review whether the\n\nagency's    decision   to   preempt     constitutes   \"a   reasonable\n\naccommodation of conflicting policies . . . committed to [its]\n\ncare\" and whether \"it appears from the statute or its legislative\n\nhistory that the accommodation is not one that Congress would have\n\nsanctioned.\"   Id. at 64 (quoting United States v. Shimer, 367 U.S.\n\n374, 383 (1961)) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Fid.\n\nFed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. de la Cuesta, 458 U.S. 141, 153-54\n\n(1982).    As we explain, the district court should engage in this\n\nreview on remand.\n\n           The United States secondly suggests that Massachusetts'\n\ntug escort provisions are statutorily preempted by the Coast Guard\n\nAuthorization Act of 1998 (CGAA), Pub. L. No. 105-383, 112 Stat.\n\n3411, under which Congress, apparently frustrated that the Coast\n\nGuard had not acted under Title I as to waters in the Northeast,\n\nordered the Coast Guard to do so.     Section 311(b)(1)(A) of the CGAA\n\nprovides that \"[n]ot later than December 31, 1998, the [Coast\n\nGuard] shall promulgate regulations for towing vessel and barge\n\nsafety for the waters of the Northeast.\"        Id. at 3423 (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n           The statutory phrase is not an expression of intent by\n\nCongress that any such Coast Guard regulations -- regardless of\n\n\n                                -33-\n\fscope, subject matter, or expression of intent to preempt -- would\n\noccupy the field.    It is a command to the Coast Guard to promulgate\n\ncertain types of regulations, which it already had authority to do\n\nunder Title I.\n\n            The pertinent federal regulations cover the whole of the\n\nFirst Coast Guard District, including Massachusetts.               33 C.F.R.\n\n§ 165.100(d)(1)(i), (ii) (effective January 29, 1999); 63 Fed. Reg.\n\n71,764, 71,771 (Dec. 30, 1998).          The regulations require that\n\nsingle-hull   tank   barges,   unless    being   towed   by    a   twin-screw\n\npropulsion primary towing vessel (with separate power for each\n\nscrew), must be accompanied by a tugboat escort.22                 33 C.F.R.\n\n§ 165.100(d)(1)(i).    The federal regulations specifically exclude\n\ndouble-hull tank barges from the tug escort requirement.                 Id.\n\n§ 165.100(d)(1)(ii).\n\n            The United States argues that Massachusetts' tug escort\n\nprovisions for sensitive waters are preempted because they are\n\ninconsistent with the Coast Guard's regulatory choice that the\n\ntopic of tug escorts in Northeast waters be regulated on a regional\n\nbasis.    A federal agency's choice in favor of national or regional\n\nregulation is a ground for conflict preemption.               See Locke, 529\n\n\n\n     22\n          The federal regulations delegate some authority to the\n\"Captain of the Port\" to grant exceptions to the tug escort rule.\n33 C.F.R. § 165.100(d)(1)(iii).    In a different paragraph, the\nregulations also impose special enhanced radio communication\nrequirements for some sensitive locations within Massachusetts'\nwaters. Id. § 165.100(d)(2).\n\n                                  -34-\n\fU.S. at 109-10. Significantly, the United States has not argued on\n\nappeal that it would literally be impossible for ships to comply\n\nwith both the state statute and federal regulations concerning tug\n\nescorts.23\n\n             The state responds on two fronts.   The first argument is\n\nthat there is no conflict preemption here because the Coast Guard\n\nregulations do not impose a \"local navigation rule,\" as does Mass.\n\nGen. Laws ch. 21M, § 6.    The state asserts that its law is valid if\n\nthe Coast Guard has not adopted a rule regarding the particular\n\nwaters addressed by the challenged state law.         In essence, the\n\nstate reads Ray to say that Title I conflict preemption requires an\n\nexact coincidence between the subject matters of the federal and\n\nstate regulations.      Ray says no such thing.      Although Ray did\n\nexpress an interest in whether the Secretary had \"promulgated his\n\nown tug requirement for Puget Sound,\" 435 U.S. at 171 (emphasis\n\nadded), the Court did not hold that an exact coincidence in subject\n\nmatter was required to find conflict preemption, id. at 171-72,\n\n174-75.\n\n\n\n\n     23\n          The district court did find such an impossibility,\nstating that \"[t]ank barges traveling through Massachusetts waters\n. . . cannot comply with both the state and federal regulations.\"\nMassachusetts, 440 F. Supp. 2d at 42.     The state protests that\nthere is no impossibility because nothing in the federal\nregulations prohibits taking on a tugboat escort.      The United\nStates has neither relied on nor defended the district court's\nruling, so we do not consider it.\n\n                                 -35-\n\f            Indeed, there was no federal regulation in Ray purporting\n\nto regulate the use of tug escorts specifically in Puget Sound, nor\n\nwas there a federal regulation covering a broader area which\n\nincluded    Puget   Sound.24    Id.    at    171-72.      Here,   the   federal\n\nregulations contain within their breadth the narrower group of\n\nwaters which are the subject of state regulation.             Crucially, the\n\nstate's argument contains an assumption that federal regulation on\n\na regional basis is disfavored, and that there is a presumption in\n\nfavor of state regulation of local waters.             Not so, as Locke makes\n\nclear.    529 U.S. at 108.     As it is framed, the state's argument is\n\nuntenable.\n\n            More generally, the state argues that the Coast Guard has\n\nnot determined that 33 C.F.R. § 165.100(d)(1) preempts the state\n\ntug escort rule at issue.         The initial question is whether the\n\nCoast Guard has expressed an intent to preempt Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\n\n21M, § 6.    The United States argues that it is obvious from the\n\nregulation and the Coast Guard's accompanying statements that such\n\nan intent has been expressed.\n\n            The law of preemption by agency regulation, as the state\n\namici point out, requires a clear statement from the federal agency\n\n\n     24\n          The Court did comment that then-pending rulemaking\n\"requir[ing] tug escorts for certain vessels operating in confined\nwaters,\" if passed, had the potential to preempt the state's tug\nescort rule. Ray, 435 U.S. at 172 (emphasis added); see also 41\nFed. Reg. 18,770, 18,771 (May 6, 1976). Notably, the Court did not\nsuggest that the federal rule would need to specify particular\n\"confined waters\" in order to preempt the state's tug escort rule.\n\n                                      -36-\n\fof its intention to preempt the state regulation at issue.               The\n\nSupreme Court has held that \"it is appropriate to expect an\n\nadministrative regulation to declare any intention to pre-empt\n\nstate law with some specificity.\"            Cal. Coastal Comm'n v. Granite\n\nRock Co., 480 U.S. 572, 583 (1987) (citing Hillsborough County, 471\n\nU.S. at 718).      Like other federal agencies, the Coast Guard must,\n\n\"[t]o the extent practicable and permitted by law,\" publish a\n\nfederalism summary impact statement discussing \"any regulation that\n\nhas federalism implications and that preempts State law,\" after\n\nconsultation with state and local officials.                Exec. Order No.\n\n13,132, § 6(c), 64 Fed. Reg. 43,255, 43,258 (Aug. 4, 1999).               We\n\napply this specificity requirement.\n\n              The relevant administrative record on this issue does not\n\nconsist merely of the First Coast Guard District regulations, 33\n\nC.F.R.    §    165.100,   and   the   attendant     1998   Federal   Register\n\nstatement, 63 Fed. Reg. 71,764.              It also consists of two later\n\nFederal Register statements, issued in 2004 and 2006, which are\n\nmore pertinently about a proposed tug escort rule for Buzzards Bay.\n\nThe 1998 Federal Register statement25 could not have addressed MOSPA\n\n\n     25\n          The Coast Guard made several points in its 1998\nexplanation of the regulations at 33 C.F.R. § 165.100.\nSpecifically noting the environmental sensitivity of waters in the\nNortheast, including Massachusetts waters, it stated: \"This rule\ntakes a regional approach responsive to the particular risks\ninherent in the transportation of petroleum products on the\nwaterways in the Northeastern United States.\"     63 Fed. Reg. at\n71,765. The Coast Guard noted that several New England states were\nattempting to regulate tank barges transporting oil, and that\n\n                                      -37-\n\fbecause MOSPA was not enacted until 2004.       But the Coast Guard was\n\nwell aware of MOSPA when it issued its two later statements.\n\n              In October 2004, the Coast Guard gave advance notice of\n\nproposed rulemaking that would require tug escorts for tank barges\n\ntransiting Buzzards Bay.     See 69 Fed. Reg. at 62,427.      The advance\n\nnotice solicited comments on, inter alia, seven questions.          Id. at\n\n62,429.       As to federalism concerns, the 2004 notice took the\n\nposition that several undefined provisions of MOSPA were preempted\n\nby the rulings in Locke and Ray, and specifically that section 17\n\nof MOSPA (codified at Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 103, § 28), concerning\n\npilotage requirements for certain vessels engaged in the coastwise\n\ntrade, was preempted by operation of law.           Id. at 62,429-30; see\n\nalso 2004 Mass. Acts at 933.        It is noteworthy that although the\n\nCoast Guard in its 2004 notice was clearly aware of the enactment\n\nof   MOSPA,    its   federalism   statement   did   not   comment   on   the\n\npreemption of the tug escort provision, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21M,\n\n\n\"[t]he states' differing legislative initiatives might result in\ninconsistent regulation of the industry.\" Id. The Coast Guard\nalso noted comments that the rules for positive control of barges\nshould be national in scope, but it rejected that position in favor\nof regional regulation. Id. at 71,765-66. The 1998 explanation\ncontains no explicit statement rejecting state regulation of\nparticularized local waters.\n          Significantly, under the heading of \"Federalism,\" the\nCoast Guard discussed whether its regulations would preempt certain\nprovisions of Rhode Island law. The Coast Guard concluded, inter\nalia, that its regulations would preempt Rhode Island law on\npositive control for barges, found at R.I. Gen. Laws § 46-12.6-\n8(a)(3) (repealed 2000). 63 Fed. Reg. at 71,770. The Rhode Island\nlaw had statewide application and was not limited to specified\nlocal waters. 1997 R.I. Pub. Laws 217, 217-18.\n\n                                   -38-\n\f§ 6.        See 69 Fed. Reg. at 62,429-30.           If the only pertinent\n\nstatements were those in 1998 and 2004, we would conclude that the\n\nCoast Guard had not clearly expressed an intent to preempt the\n\nstate tug escort provisions.\n\n              What throws the matter in doubt is the most recent\n\nfederalism statement from the Coast Guard.               The parties and the\n\ndistrict court did not focus on the 2006 statement.              In March 2006,\n\nthe Coast Guard issued a notice of proposed rulemaking for Buzzards\n\nBay, 71 Fed. Reg. 15,649.26           That notice, like the 2004 notice,\n\nstates that section 17 of MOSPA is void by operation of law.               Id.\n\nat 15,653.      The 2006 notice also suggests that parts of section 11\n\nof MOSPA -- which is codified at Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21M, §§ 1-8,\n\nand so covers the relevant provision -- are preempted.                The 2006\n\nnotice      specifically   mentions    the   tug   escort   requirements    for\n\n\n       26\n          The proposed amendments            for   the   First    Coast   Guard\nDistrict Regulated Navigation Area\n\n              would require that all single-hull tank barges\n              carrying 5000 or more barrels of oil or other\n              hazardous material and being towed through\n              Buzzards Bay, meet the following requirements:\n              1. Be accompanied by an escort tug between the\n              west entrance to Buzzards Bay and the east end\n              of the Cape Cod Canal.\n              2. Be accompanied by a federally licensed\n              pilot, who may remain on the escort tug\n              vessel, to monitor the navigation of the\n              tug/barge, and to advise the master of the\n              tug/barge accordingly.\n\n71 Fed. Reg. at 15,652. The proposed amendments also sought to\nestablish a \"Vessel Movement Reporting System\" within Buzzards Bay\nto monitor the movements of certain vessels. Id.\n\n                                      -39-\n\fvessels in Buzzards Bay (codified at Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21M, § 6),\n\nand suggests, for the first time, that these requirements are\n\npreempted.        It does so not by expressing a direct intent to\n\npreempt, but by stating a conclusion that Locke and Ray operate to\n\npreempt Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21M, § 6. 71 Fed. Reg. at 15,653.\n\nFurther, the language suggesting that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21M, § 6\n\nis preempted is not as explicit as that used to signal the\n\npreemption of section 17 of MOSPA.              See 71 Fed. Reg. at 15,653.\n\n               Under   these     circumstances,      the   better       course    is    to\n\nremand.      The parties should have the opportunity to address, among\n\nany    other    issues,    the    questions     of   whether      the     Coast   Guard\n\nsufficiently expressed a clear intent to preempt the state tug\n\nescort provisions in 2006, and whether, if so, the Coast Guard's\n\nposition is clearly inconsistent with congressional intent.                            See\n\nCal. Coastal Comm'n, 480 U.S. at 583; Hillsborough County, 471 U.S.\n\nat 714-15.\n\n               As was true in Ray, \"[i]t may be that [federal] rules\n\nwill    be   forthcoming       that    will   pre-empt      the   State's        present\n\ntug-escort rule . . . .\"           435 U.S. at 172.        For now, we remand and\n\nencourage       the    parties    to   take     advantage    of     the    federalism\n\nconsultations between the Coast Guard and the Commonwealth of\n\nMassachusetts, which have already started.                  See 71 Fed. Reg. at\n\n15,654; 69 Fed. Reg. at 62,430.\n\n             V. THE STATE'S FINANCIAL ASSURANCE REQUIREMENT\n\n\n                                         -40-\n\f           The    parties     again   disagree   on   the   proper     frame    of\n\nanalysis   of    the   state's   financial     assurance    statute    and     its\n\nexception.      Nonetheless, the parties do agree that the analysis\n\nhere is different from that of the other regulations at issue\n\nbecause Congress (through its enactment of OPA) has expressly saved\n\nthe   states'    power   to   establish      liability   rules   and    related\n\nrequirements.     See 33 U.S.C. § 2718.       Indeed, the Supreme Court has\n\nclarified that OPA did not preempt state power to \"establish\n\nliability rules and financial requirements relating to oil spills.\"\n\nLocke, 529 U.S. at 105.\n\n           MOSPA's financial assurance requirement has two relevant\n\nparts, one of which is under attack, and the other of which is\n\nconceded not to be preempted (assuming it is severable).                       In\n\npertinent part, the state statute provides:\n\n           (a) Any vessel, whether or not self-propelled,\n           in or entering upon the waters of the\n           commonwealth for the purpose of transporting,\n           discharging or receiving a cargo of oil,\n           hazardous material, or hazardous waste, shall\n           be   subject   to  the   financial   assurance\n           requirements and penalty authority as provided\n           in subsections (b) to (d), inclusive.\n\n           (b) A certificate of financial assurance\n           obtained individually or jointly by the\n           vessel, its owner or agent, its charterer, or\n           by the owner or operator of the terminal at\n           which the vessel discharges or receives its\n           cargo, shall be provided to the department in\n           the amount of at least $1,000,000,000.\n           Vessels with a capacity of less than 6,000\n           barrels shall present a certificate of\n           financial assurance to the department of\n           environmental protection in the amount of\n\n                                      -41-\n\f           $5,000,000. A copy of the financial assurance\n           shall be posted on the vessel.\n\n           (c) . . . .\n\n           (d) The department may allow financial\n           assurance in a lower amount based upon\n           criteria that includes, but is not limited to,\n           the type and amount of the above cargo\n           transported by the vessel; the size and\n           construction of the vessel, including whether\n           the vessel is double hulled; the safety record\n           of the vessel or the vessel owner, the loss or\n           accident history of the vessel or vessel owner\n           involving maritime spills and the safety\n           equipment used by the vessel. The financial\n           assurance shall be in a form approved by the\n           department.\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 21, § 50C.\n\n           The United States concedes that, standing alone, the\n\nprovisions for the $1 billion and $5 million financial assurance\n\ncertificates (subsections (a) and (b)) are within the state's power\n\nunder OPA's savings clauses, 33 U.S.C. § 2718(a)(1), (c).27    The\n\ndispute is over section 50C(d), which provides that the state\n\nDepartment of Environmental Protection may lower the amount of the\n\nbond according to certain criteria, some of which are defined by\n\nstatute.   The specified criteria include: \"the type and amount of\n\ncargo transported . . .; the size and construction of the vessel,\n\n\n\n     27\n          OPA's   savings  clauses   refer   only  to   liability\nrequirements related to the discharge of oil. However, MOSPA has\na broader scope, as its financial assurance provisions also apply\nto vessels carrying hazardous materials. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\n21, § 50C(a). The parties have not discussed this disconnect in\ntheir briefs. Since the topic of hazardous materials has not been\naddressed by the parties' briefs, we do not discuss it further.\n\n                                 -42-\n\fincluding whether the vessel is double hulled; the safety record of\n\nthe vessel or the vessel owner\"; and the vessel's safety equipment.\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 21, § 50C(d).      The department is also given\n\ndiscretion to use other criteria.     Id.\n\n          There are two relevant OPA savings clauses.    The first,\n\n33 U.S.C. § 2718(a)(1)(A), provides:\n\n          Nothing in this Act . . . shall --\n\n          (1) affect, or be construed or interpreted as\n          preempting, the authority of any State or\n          political subdivision thereof from imposing\n          any additional liability or requirements with\n          respect to --\n\n          (A) the discharge of oil or other pollution by\n          oil within such State . . . .\n\nThe second clause, 33 U.S.C. § 2718(c)(1), provides:\n\n          Nothing in this Act . . . shall in any way\n          affect, or be construed to affect, the\n          authority of the United States or any State or\n          political subdivision thereof --\n\n          (1)   to   impose   additional  liability  or\n          additional requirements [relating to the\n          discharge,   or   substantial  threat   of  a\n          discharge, of oil] . . . .\n\nThese clauses in OPA do not define \"requirements.\"      The clauses\n\nsave state laws from preemption by OPA's Title I, but not from\n\nOPA's other titles, or from other federal statutes.      Locke, 529\n\nU.S. at 106.\n\n          The United States asserts that MOSPA is problematic\n\nbecause the exceptions in section 50C(d) encompass criteria at the\n\n\n\n                               -43-\n\fcore of PWSA's Title II.28               Moreover, the state statute merely\n\nprovides that the criteria are to be administered by the state\n\nagency, and it offers no further guidance.\n\n                The United States asserts that the state may not regulate\n\nindirectly what it cannot regulate directly under Title II.                  The\n\nstate and the Coalition acknowledge that an indirect regulation\n\nargument might survive Ray.               Ray did consider such an indirect\n\nregulation theory, although there the theory did not concern a\n\nstate        financial    assurance   certification      under   OPA's   savings\n\nclauses.        See 435 U.S. at 173 & n.25 (inquiring whether a state's\n\ntug escort rule indirectly regulated primary conduct, and rejecting\n\nthat possibility on the facts presented).                    Nonetheless, even\n\nassuming       arguendo    that   some    theory   of   impermissible    indirect\n\nregulation is viable even in a savings clause case, the United\n\n\n\n\n        28\n          In support of its argument that section 50C(d) invades\nthe province of Title II, the United States notes that Title II\nspecifically requires the Coast Guard to issue safety regulations\nthat consider \"the types and grades of cargo permitted to be on\nboard a tank vessel.\" 46 U.S.C. § 3703(b). It also requires the\nCoast Guard to regulate tank vessel design standards, id.\n§ 3703(a), mandates that the Coast Guard promulgate rules regarding\n\"superstructures\" and \"hulls,\" id. § 3703(a)(1),      requires the\nCoast Guard to prescribe rules regarding the equipping of tank\nvessels, id., and instructs the Coast Guard to issue rules\nconcerning \"equipment and appliances for lifesaving, fire\nprotection, and prevention and mitigation of damage to the marine\nenvironment,\" id. § 3703(a)(3). The United States also points out\nthat   a   different   federal   statute    establishes   reporting\nrequirements.   See id. § 6101 (requiring that the Coast Guard\nprescribe regulations on marine incident reporting and listing\nspecific kinds of incidents that the regulations must cover).\n\n                                          -44-\n\fStates has not to date met its burden on its argument that the\n\nstatute is not within the powers reserved to the states.\n\n           In this case, the two sides take fundamentally different\n\nviews of what constitutes impermissible indirect regulation. There\n\nis a lack of clarity regarding the exact nature of both the United\n\nStates' claim and the state's defense.           The issue can be viewed as\n\na spectrum problem.         On the one hand, there is the state's\n\nstatutory choice to establish a financial assurance program, the\n\ncost of which may be reduced by criteria which are attuned to\n\ndegree of risk.         Such gradations are common to most insurance\n\nschemes.    On    the    other   hand,   there   is   a   federal   fear   that\n\nimplementation of this scheme will lead to state regulation of\n\nprimary conduct -- conduct that is exclusively under federal\n\ncontrol pursuant to Title II.29\n\n           In    the    United   States'   view,      MOSPA's   impermissible\n\nindirect effect is inherent in the structure of its financial\n\nassurance provision. Because here, according to the United States,\n\n\"the potential to influence primary conduct cannot be eliminated or\n\neven discounted,\" the statute is preempted as a matter of law.\n\n\n\n     29\n          The state amici argue that there is no reason to assume\nthat the state's scheme is a pretext to regulate Title II subjects,\nor to assume that the state has improper motives. However, the\nUnited States' objection is concerned with the potential effects of\nthe scheme on primary conduct under Title II, regardless of motive.\nIn any event, because there is insufficient evidence even of the\nstatute's effects, we need not decide if improper motive is\nrelevant to the preemption inquiry.\n\n                                    -45-\n\fUnder this theory, there is no need to present facts demonstrating\n\nthat the provision would impose an actual burden or impediment to\n\nfederal Title II authority.\n\n          One might ask why, if the state may impose a $1 billion\n\nfinancial assurance requirement, a state may not also reduce the\n\namount based on the objective criteria set forth in the statute --\n\ncriteria which appear, on their face, to be rationally related to\n\nthe degree of the risk posed.     After all, there would appear to be\n\nless risk of spillage from a double-hulled vessel.            Similarly, a\n\nvessel's capacity would presumably be related to the amount of\n\nexpected liability if a spill did occur. Tellingly, OPA itself has\n\na federal financial assurance requirement; as recently amended by\n\nCongress, the statute requires differing amounts of financial\n\nassurance based on whether or not a vessel is single-hulled, based\n\non whether or not the vessel is a \"tank vessel,\" and based on the\n\ngross tonnage30 of the vessel.    33 U.S.C. §§ 2704, 2716.\n\n          The   United   States   responds   that   MOSPA's    $1   billion\n\nrequirement is effectively no more than a ceiling, and that in\n\npractice the amounts charged will vary depending on criteria that\n\nare exclusively under federal control under PWSA's Title II.           The\n\nUnited States argues that a state may never use criteria within\n\n\n\n     30\n          It appears that \"gross tonnage\" is a measure for a ship's\ninternal capacity.      See Webster's Third New International\nDictionary 2407 (1993); see also 46 C.F.R. § 69.9 (\"Gross tonnage\nmeans a vessel's approximate volume.\").\n\n                                  -46-\n\fTitle II to ground its decisions.31         That is because the state's\n\nmechanism amounts to a financial incentive \"for any design, cargo\n\nor equipment changes that [state regulators] think appropriate.\"\n\nWe are doubtful that when Congress authorized the states to set\n\nfinancial assurance requirements it at the same time meant per se\n\nto preempt states from using graduated levels rationally related to\n\nrisk.        It is again worth observing that OPA itself imposes federal\n\nfinancial assurance requirements that are not uniform for all\n\nvessels.        Under the OPA regime, vessels over 300 gross tons with\n\noil on board, and certain other vessels of any size, are required\n\nto provide evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to meet\n\nOPA's liability maximums.        33 U.S.C. § 2716; see also id. § 2704\n\n(setting forth liability maximums).         At the time OPA was enacted,\n\nthese maximums differed based on the vessel's gross tonnage, and\n\nbased on whether or not the vessel was a tank vessel.32      Pub. L. No.\n\n\n     31\n          Under the United States' theory, it would make no\ndifference if the state set a minimum amount for a bond and\nratcheted it up according to these defined criteria, or if the\nstate instead set a ceiling and ratcheted down.\n        32\n          A later amendment introduced even more gradations. This\namendment significantly increased the size of the liability\nmaximums, and also adjusted the limits to take into account whether\nor not a vessel is single hulled. See Delaware River Protection\nAct of 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-241, § 603, 120 Stat. 516, 553-54\n(codified at 33 U.S.C. § 2704). The amendment also required the\nCoast Guard to report back to Congress, within 45 days of the\namendment's enactment, on the adequacy of the federal liability\nlimits. Id.\n          The Coast Guard has yet to revise its financial assurance\nregulations to respond to this statutory amendment.        While it\n\"anticipate[s] initiating a rulemaking\" to institute the changes,\n\n                                     -47-\n\f101-380, § 1004(a), 104 Stat. at 491-92.        In light of this, it is\n\ndifficult to believe that Congress intended to preclude the states\n\nfrom similarly calibrating their financial assurance requirements\n\nto account for different vessel characteristics.\n\n             Moreover, we should not be quick to assume that Congress\n\nintended preemption here.      One commentator has read Ray to mean\n\nthat when a state provides for alternative courses of behavior, one\n\npreempted and one not, the overall state scheme is not preempted\n\nunless the state's requirements act to exert pressure on operators\n\nin preempted areas.      See Tribe, supra, § 6-26, at 486-87.        Ray\n\nconsidered and rejected such a claim on its facts, and in light of\n\nthe Court's treatment of the issue, Professor Tribe has concluded\n\nthat \"the basic teaching of the [Ray] decision is that state\n\npressure to act in derogation of a federal statutory scheme is not\n\nto be inferred lightly.\"     Id. at 487.\n\n             That principle has even more force in our case.    In OPA,\n\nCongress expressly preserved state power to require financial\n\nassurance. Ray's discussion of indirect regulation did not involve\n\nany   such   explicit   congressional    preservation.   Moreover,   Ray\n\ndecided the indirect regulation issue on a detailed record replete\n\nwith factual stipulations.     435 U.S. at 156, 173 & n.25.    In this\n\n\n\n71 Fed. Reg. 47,737, 47,738 (Aug. 18, 2006), it has told vessel\noperators that the prior requirements for submitting evidence of\nfinancial responsibility remain in effect until such rulemaking\ntakes place, id.\n\n                                  -48-\n\fcontext, we reject the United States' arguments that the existence\n\nof pressure to conform conduct can be decided here as a matter of\n\nlaw,    and   that    the   actual    effects       of     the     state    statute   are\n\nirrelevant.\n\n              As a fallback argument, the United States contends that\n\nit has established the existence of burdensome pressure, as MOSPA\n\ngives a state agency the authority to calibrate the assurance\n\nrequirement on a case-by-case basis with only general guidance. It\n\nis not clear whether the United States means to argue that the\n\nstate could constitutionally enact a financial assurance provision\n\nwhich, for example, allowed reductions according to a legislatively\n\nset schedule based on various design and other defined criteria.33\n\nNor is it clear if the United States' position would permit a state\n\nto   use    regulations     (rather     than    a       statute)    to     enact   such    a\n\nprovision, if these regulations reduced and cabined administrative\n\ndiscretion.\n\n              The    district   court    took       a    different       approach.        It\n\ncorrectly held that the effect of the statute was relevant.                               It\n\nasked whether the practical effect of the $1 billion rule was to\n\nforce vessels to seek reductions pursuant to the exemption scheme.\n\nMassachusetts, 440 F. Supp. 2d at 46.                     The court then decided,\n\nwithout hearing any evidence and on a motion for judgment on the\n\n\n       33\n          The United States concedes that the state legislature\n\"has substantial latitude to calibrate the bond requirement.\" But\nthe full reach of this concession is not entirely clear.\n\n                                        -49-\n\fpleadings, \"that the Commonwealth's one billion dollar financial\n\nassurance requirement imposes such an onerous financial obligation\n\non a tank vessel owner that it in effect forces compliance with the\n\nstatutory exception criteria.\"          Id.\n\n           As an initial matter, the $1 billion amount does not\n\nappear to be plainly unreasonable when measured against risk.             The\n\nremedial costs of the Exxon Valdez spill in 1989 surpassed $2\n\nbillion (as measured in 1990 dollars).           A. Rodriguez & P. Jaffe,\n\nThe Oil Pollution Act of 1990, 15 Tul. Mar. L.J. 1, 16 (1990).             In\n\nBuzzards Bay, while the clean-up costs from the 2003 spill were\n\nsignificantly lower, they were still sizable.34\n\n           Moreover, the record does not yet contain evidence about\n\nthe   requirements     other   states    have   set,   industry   usage   and\n\npractice, or the costs of obtaining financial assurance.           Nor have\n\nthe   parties   even   discussed   or     presented    evidence   about   the\n\nrequirements set by the federal government. While our own research\n\non this last point has uncovered the federal rules, see 33 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 2704, 2716, those rules simply highlight the need for further\n\n\n      34\n          One estimate, offered by the Executive Director of the\nBuzzards Bay National Estuary Program, put those costs at $36\nmillion, which was on top of the $10 million the vessel owners paid\nin criminal penalties. See J. Costa, Costs of the Bouchard No. 120\nOil Spill, http://www.buzzardsbay.org/oilspillcosts.htm (last\nupdated Dec. 21, 2005); see also R. Mishra, Legal Technicality\nDerails $10M Redress for Oil Spill, Boston Globe, Sept. 15, 2004,\nat B2 (stating that $38 million had already been spent on clean-\nup). That spill involved \"only\" 98,000 gallons of oil. A larger\nspill, such as the 300,000 gallon spill that nearby Narragansett\nBay saw in 1989, might be expected to impose far greater costs.\n\n                                   -50-\n\ffacts.    Indeed, the federal requirements set a complicated formula\n\nbased in part on a vessel's gross tonnage, and there is nothing in\n\nthe record informing us about the gross tonnages of vessels that\n\ntraverse Buzzards Bay.\n\n            Of course, even if the $1 billion amount were not in\n\nitself unreasonable, it is possible that such an amount would still\n\nplace    strong    pressure   on   the   industry   to   change   its   primary\n\nconduct.    Yet there is simply no evidence on this point.\n\n            The district court also found it significant that there\n\nwas a lack of notice to vessel owners about the specific criteria\n\nthat the state would use in lowering the bond amount; this was the\n\ncrux of its concern about the vagueness of the criteria and the\n\nuntrammeled delegation to the state agency. See Massachusetts, 440\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 46.            Given its finding that the state system\n\nnecessarily forced vessels into compliance with the exemptions, the\n\ncourt held that the exemption scheme necessarily undercut the\n\ncertainty that federal regulation under Title II afforded the\n\nindustry.    Id.\n\n            The state characterizes the indirect regulation issue\n\ndifferently.      It agrees with the district court that the analysis\n\nmight turn on the practical effect of the $1 billion amount and the\n\nimplemented exceptions.        But it argues that there was no evidence\n\nof record to support the district court's conclusion.                   It also\n\n\n\n\n                                     -51-\n\fpoints out that an offer of proof was made to the court of evidence\n\nthat no real burden is posed by the exemptions to the statute.\n\n             The analysis presented thus far is insufficient to permit\n\nresolution of the matter on its merits.           As the state has not yet\n\nexercised its administrative authority, it is unclear how it would\n\nchoose to grant exceptions to the financial assurance requirement.\n\nWe simply cannot yet say that MOSPA's section 50C(d) is incapable\n\nof any constitutional application.          It may well be that the state\n\nwill structure its decision making as to the exemption in a way\n\nthat would frame the preemption question differently.              It may even\n\nbe that discussions between state and federal authorities would\n\nproduce an agreed-upon scheme that adequately protects both state\n\nand federal interests.       Given the absence of evidence at this\n\nstage, it is too early to know whether the state exception scheme\n\nwould     intrude   impermissibly   on     the   Coast   Guard's    exclusive\n\nauthority under Title II.35    On this record, the district court was\n\n\n\n\n     35\n           Our conclusion, that a permanent injunction was\npremature, also encompasses the plaintiffs' claim that section\n50C(d) is preempted insofar as it allows reductions based on a\nvessel's safety record. Plaintiffs have asserted that this part of\nthe law is invalid because it interferes with exclusive Coast Guard\nreporting requirements.     See 46 U.S.C. § 6101.     The apparent\nassumption is that when a vessel applies for the exception, the\nstate will necessarily require the vessel owner to describe past\nsafety incidents. But this conclusion is too hasty. For example,\nthe state agency could decide to simply look at the reports\nrequired to be filed under federal law.\n\n                                    -52-\n\fnot warranted in permanently enjoining any aspects of the financial\n\nassurance provision.36\n\n           Nonetheless, we do share the concerns of the United\n\nStates that the state has yet to make a showing, by regulation or\n\notherwise, explaining how it will utilize its discretion under\n\nsection 50C(d).    Since the state has not structured its exemption\n\nscheme, there is no operational scheme to enjoin. The state should\n\nmake such a showing on remand; we leave it to the district court to\n\nconsider   the    appropriateness   of   a    preliminary   injunction\n\nthereafter.\n\n                           VI.   CONCLUSION\n\n           The questions here do not turn on whether the state or\n\nthe federal regulations best protect Buzzards Bay and the sensitive\n\nwaters of Massachusetts from oil spills, given the costs imposed by\n\nregulation.      Making such determinations is not the role of a\n\nfederal court.\n\n\n\n\n     36\n          Although there is some ambiguity, and the parties\ndisagree on appeal, we conclude that the district court sub\nsilentio held that the exception clause, section 50C(d), was\nseverable from the rest of the statute. At the end of its opinion,\nthe court stated that \"[t]he Commonwealth is . . . permanently\nenjoined from conditioning the one billion dollar financial\nassurance requirement on criteria of tank vessel design, operation,\nequipping, or reporting requirements.\" Massachusetts, 440 F. Supp.\n2d at 48. The court further stated that it was not enjoining all\npossible uses of the discretionary exception -- just those in the\nspecifically mentioned areas.     Id. at 48 n.204.    The district\ncourt's decision left clauses (a) through (c) fully in place.\n\n                                 -53-\n\f            Our question is whether the district court erred in\n\nconcluding, as a matter of judgment on the pleadings, that the PWSA\n\nleft   no   room   for   the   state    government   to   enact   these   state\n\nstatutory    provisions.       The     district   court   erred   in   entering\n\npermanent injunctions, as well as in entering judgment for the\n\nUnited States, at this stage in the proceedings.\n\n            On remand, the parties should address the question of an\n\ninterim agreement to stay MOSPA's provisions pendente lite. In the\n\nabsence of an agreement by the parties, we leave it to the district\n\ncourt to determine whether the United States can, under the proper\n\nanalysis, meet its burden that the state should be preliminarily\n\nenjoined from enforcement of the relevant statutory sections.\n\n            No costs are awarded.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -54-\n\f",

Several states, including Massachusetts, have passed laws to protect particularly sensitive waterways. The framework for analyzing such conflicts derives from the several preemption analyses set forth in <i>United States v. Locke,</i> 529 U.S. 89, 120 S.Ct. 1135, 146 L.Ed.2d 69 (2000), and <i>Ray v. Atlantic Richfield Co.,</i> 435 U.S. 151, 98 S.Ct. 988, 55 L.Ed.2d 179 (1978). In short, depending on the nature of state and federal regulations, either field preemption, conflict preemption, or overlap analysis is used to determine whether state law impermissibly infringes on federal authority.</p>\n<p>After a catastrophic oil spill in Buzzards Bay in 2003, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts enacted the Massachusetts Oil <span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> Spill Prevention Act (MOSPA). <i>See</i> 2004 Mass. Acts 920 (codified as amended primarily at Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21, §§ 42, 50B-50E, and ch. 21M). MOSPA imposes requirements designed to reduce the risk of oil spills, and to ensure that adequate resources are available to remedy such spills.</p>\n<p>The United States sued Massachusetts on January 18, 2005, seeking to enjoin the enforcement of several MOSPA provisions. The United States alleged that these provisions were preempted by the Ports and Waterways Safety Act of 1972, Pub L. No. 92-340, 86 Stat. 424, as amended by the Port and Tanker Safety Act of 1978, Pub.L. No. 95-474, 92 Stat. 1471 (collectively, the \"PWSA\"), and by regulations promulgated thereunder by the Coast Guard.<sup>[1]</sup> This allegation included a claim that MOSPA's financial assurance requirement, which requires certain vessels to post a bond to ensure their ability to respond financially to an oil spill, <i>see</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21, § 50C, was preempted by Title II of the PWSA, notwithstanding relevant savings clauses in the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (\"OPA\"), Pub.L. No. 101-380, 104 Stat. 484, 505-06 (codified at 33 U.S.C. § 2718). The United States did not assert violations of any treaties or claim that federal foreign affairs powers were at issue.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>The Commonwealth disputed each claim of preemption. It argued that Congress had given the states leeway to regulate particularly sensitive local waterways, at least in the absence of an actual conflict with a federal statute or regulation. In the state's view, there was no such conflict.</p>\n<p>The district court, acting on the United States' motion for judgment on the pleadings, and thus without taking evidence, entered judgment for plaintiffs and permanently enjoined all of the challenged provisions.<sup>[3]</sup><i>United States v. Massachusetts,</i> 440 F.Supp.2d 24, 48 (D.Mass.2006).</p>\n<p>The Commonwealth's appeal challenges the injunction only insofar as it blocked three of MOSPA's provisions: an enhanced manning requirement for tank barges and tow vessels in Buzzards Bay, <i>see</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21M, § 4; a tug escort requirement for special interest waters, <i>see id.</i> § 6; and a requirement that certain vessels obtain a certificate of financial assurance, the amount of which can vary, <i>see id.</i> ch. 21, § 50C.</p>\n<p>We vacate the entry of judgment and the permanent injunction for the United States, and we remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. As <span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> we explain, the district court did not adhere to the analytical structure the Supreme Court has required to resolve federal-state conflicts in this area. The district court acted prematurely.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Buzzards Bay is one of five recognized Estuaries of National Significance. <i>See</i> 69 Fed.Reg. 62,427, 62,428 (Oct. 26, 2004); <i>see also</i> 33 U.S.C. § 1330 (establishing a national estuary program). Massachusetts has designated the Bay as part of an \"Ocean Sanctuary.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 132A, § 13(c).</p>\n<p>Buzzards Bay is characterized by unusually dangerous ledges, reefs, and currents. Most of the Bay is less than 50 feet deep, and the Bay is less than 8 miles wide. <i>See</i> B. Howes et al., <i>Ecology of Buzzards Bay: An Estuarine Profile</i> 7, 23-24 (U.S. Dep't of the Interior, Biological Report No. 33, 1996), <i>available at</i> http://cuadra.cr.usgs. gov/Techrpt/96-33.pdf. The Bay's Cape Cod Canal has unusually strong tidal currents, and it \"represents a significant navigational challenge.\" <i>Id.</i> at 98.</p>\n<p>Significant volumes of oil are transported through the Bay and Canal each year. In 2002, about 80% of the trips were made in single-hull barges. 71 Fed.Reg. 15,649, 15,650 (Mar. 29, 2006). In the state's view, the waters of Buzzards Bay are subject to a disproportionate and unnecessary risk of an oil spill. A Coast Guard-sponsored report has concluded that \"the risk for oil or hazardous material discharge in Buzzards Bay is relatively high.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>There have already been several damaging spills in the Bay. In 1969, roughly 175,000 gallons of No. 2 fuel oil spilled into the Bay after the barge <i>Florida</i> ran aground. <i>Id.</i> In 1974, a sizable amount of oil spilled from the <i>Bouchard No. 65,</i> inflicting significant damage on local marine life. Howes et al., <i>supra,</i> at 102-03. In 1977, there was yet another <i>Bouchard</i> spill, this one releasing 81,000 gallons of fuel oil into the water. 71 Fed.Reg. at 15,650. In 1986, the tank barge <i>ST-85</i> was grounded in the Bay, spilling 119,000 gallons of gasoline.<sup>[4]</sup><i>Id.</i> In 1999, there was another grounding, this one involving a vessel carrying 4.7 million gallons of No. 6 fuel oil. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Most recently, in April 2003 the barge <i>Bouchard-120</i> released an estimated 98,000 gallons of heavy fuel oil into the Bay, killing hundreds of birds, closing thousands of acres of shellfish beds, affecting over 90 miles of coastline, and generating significant clean-up costs.<sup>[5]</sup> Massachusetts responded by enacting MOSPA on August 4, 2004. 2004 Mass. Acts at 933.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. DESCRIPTION OF FEDERAL LAW</h2>\n<p>A. <i>Background</i></p>\n<p>Federal regulation of maritime commerce has existed since the founding of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> country. <i>See</i> Act of Sept. 1, 1789, ch. 11, § 1, 1 Stat. 55. Federal regulation specifically geared toward the transport of dangerous cargoes started with the Tank Vessel Act of 1936, Pub.L. No. 74-765, 49 Stat. 1889. <i>See</i> K. Brooks, <i>California Oil Spill Laws in the Wake of United States v. Locke,</i> 12 U.S.F. Mar. L.J. 227, 230 (1999-2000). Regulatory involvement increased after 1967, the year of a massive oil spill involving a supertanker off the coast of England. Indeed, Congress has since enacted more stringent legislation for oil tankers and more comprehensive remedies for oil spills.</p>\n<p>The PWSA is a key component of this congressional response. It has two titles, both or which are at issue here, which we describe in greater detail later. Title I authorizes the Coast Guard to issue regulations on subjects within that title, although it does not so mandate. 33 U.S.C. § 1223(a). Title II works differently; it <i>requires</i> the Coast Guard to issue federal regulations governing subjects covered by that title. 46 U.S.C. § 3703(a).</p>\n<p>Several states have enacted statutes and regulations designed to give still greater protection against oil spills. The Supreme Court's 1978 decision in <i>Ray</i> concerned such state laws. <i>Ray</i> held that certain provisions of a Washington statute (concerning tanker design, tanker size, and pilotage requirements for enrolled vessels<sup>[6]</sup> ) were preempted by federal law. 435 U.S. at 159-60, 168, 178, 98 S.Ct. 988. <i>Ray</i> did uphold Washington's limited tug escort requirement for Puget Sound against a preemption challenge. <i>Id.</i> at 173, 98 S.Ct. 988.</p>\n<p>Despite the protections of the PWSA, in 1989 the supertanker <i>Exxon Valdez</i> ran aground in Alaska, causing the largest oil spill in United States history. The key congressional response was the 1990 enactment of OPA. OPA has nine titles, including provisions imposing liability on parties responsible for damages and other costs stemming from oil spills. <i>See</i> 33 U.S.C. § 2702. Two \"savings clauses\" in OPA's Title I expressly preserve and recognize state authority to impose additional liability requirements and penalties. <i>Id.</i> § 2718(a)(1), (c).</p>\n<p>The scope of these savings clauses was at issue in <i>Locke.</i> On certiorari to the Supreme Court, the United States argued that several provisions of the Washington Administrative Code were preempted; the federal government stressed the foreign relations<sup>[7]</sup> and international commerce aspects <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> of the case. <i>Locke,</i> 529 U.S. at 102-03, 120 S.Ct. 1135.</p>\n<p><i>Locke</i> governs this case. The distinctions that <i>Locke</i> drew are the subject of dispute among the parties here. <i>Locke</i> held that several provisions of Washington's regulations were preempted by federal law. <i>Id.</i> at 112-17, 120 S.Ct. 1135. The <i>Locke</i> Court held that PWSA's Title II preempted three state regulations (requiring training for tanker crews, mandating English language proficiency, and imposing a general statewide navigation-watch requirement). <i>Id.</i> at 112-14, 120 S.Ct. 1135. The Court also held that a fourth regulation (governing the reporting of marine casualties) was preempted by a different federal statute, 46 U.S.C. § 6101. <i>Id.</i> at 114-16, 120 S.Ct. 1135.</p>\n<p><i>Locke</i> did not definitively rule on all of the regulations before it. Instead, the Court remanded the issue of whether certain regulations, such as the state's watch requirement in times of restricted visibility, were of limited extraterritorial effect and were necessary to address the peculiarities of Puget Soundfactors that would weigh in favor of a Title I conflict preemption analysis rather than a Title II field preemption analysis. <i>Id.</i> at 116-17, 120 S.Ct. 1135. The Court stated that the resolution of these matters would benefit from a full development of the record, noting that the United States did not enter the case until appeal. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>For our purposes, <i>Locke</i> established a number of significant rules. <i>Locke</i> held that OPA's savings clauses preserved only \"state laws of a scope similar to the matters contained in Title I of OPA,\" <i>id.</i> at 105, 120 S.Ct. 1135, and did not constitute a reversal of <i>Ray</i>'s preemption rules as to Title I and Title II of the PWSA, <i>id.</i> at 105-07, 120 S.Ct. 1135. Rather, OPA only preserved state authority in the limited area of establishing liability rules and imposing financial requirements regarding oil spills.<sup>[8]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 105, 120 S.Ct. 1135.</p>\n<p><i>Locke</i> also rejected the use of general presumptions, either for or against preemption, and instead called for close analysis of the federal statutory structure. <i>Locke</i> expressly repudiated any notion, which might have survived <i>Ray,</i> that there is any presumption of non-preemption of state rules. <i>Id.</i> at 107-08, 120 S.Ct. 1135. <i>Locke</i> pointed out that the federal interest in national and international maritime commerce was one of the reasons cited in the Federalist Papers for adopting the Constitution, and the Court detailed the numerous federal statutes and treaties in the area. <i>Id.</i> at 99-103, 108, 120 S.Ct. 1135. At the same time, however, <i>Locke</i> did not put in place the opposite presumption, a presumption favoring preemption. Rather, the validity of state regulation must be judged against the \"federal statutory structure.\" <i>Id.</i> at 108, 120 S.Ct. 1135. Indeed, \"[n]o artificial presumption aids us in determining the scope of appropriate local regulation under the PWSA.\" <i>Id.; see also</i> P. Gudridge, Comment, United States v. Locke, <i>120 S.Ct. 1135,</i> Am. J. Int'l L. 745, 748 (2000).</p>\n<p><i>Locke</i> reinforced <i>Ray</i>'s two-category approach to preemption: either field preemption or conflict preemption is to be used. <i>Locke,</i> 529 U.S. at 109-11, 120 S.Ct. 1135. <i>Locke</i> also went further, recognizing that it would not always be clear which <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> of the two models would apply. It added a new overlap analysis to resolve that question. <i>See id.</i> at 112, 120 S.Ct. 1135.</p>\n<p>Field preemption applies to state law on subjects which are within the province of Title II of the PWSA. <i>Id.</i> at 110-11, 120 S.Ct. 1135. Other sources of federal maritime regulation may also preempt state law, even if the state law is consistent with federal law. <i>Id.</i> at 114-16, 120 S.Ct. 1135.</p>\n<p>By contrast, <i>Locke</i> held that conflict preemption applies to state regulations within the scope of Title I. Title I of the PWSA does not expressly preserve state power (unlike OPA). But Title I also does not preempt with the same force as Title II. Rather, state law in areas within the province of Title I are subject to standard conflict preemption analysis, primarily the model which the Court has utilized in Commerce Clause cases. <i>Id.</i> at 109-10, 120 S.Ct. 1135; <i>see also </i><i>Bethlehem Steel Co. v. N.Y. State Labor Relations Bd.,</i> 330 U.S. 767, 773-74, 67 S.Ct. 1026, 91 L.Ed. 1234 (1947) (discussing federal preemption of state regulation in the Commerce Clause context).</p>\n<p><i>Locke</i>'s conflict preemption analysis involves an initial inquiry into whether federal authority has been exercised through a regulation intended to displace state law, or by a federal decision of the Coast Guard that there should be no regulation of the subject in question. 529 U.S. at 109-10, 120 S.Ct. 1135. A conflict arises \"when compliance with both state and federal law is impossible, or when the state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objective of Congress.\" <i>Id.</i> at 109, 120 S.Ct. 1135 (quoting <i>California v. ARC Am. Corp.,</i> 490 U.S. 93, 100-101, 109 S.Ct. 1661, 104 L.Ed.2d 86 (1989)) (internal quotation marks omitted). \"In this context, Coast Guard regulations are to be given pre-emptive effect over conflicting state laws.\"<sup>[9]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 109-10, 120 S.Ct. 1135.</p>\n<p>Overlap analysis applies when a state law falls within the overlapping coverage of Title I and Title II. We describe that overlap analysis below.</p>\n<p>B. <i>Title I, Title II, and Overlap Analysis</i></p>\n<p>The respective scopes of Title I and Title II play a crucial role in any preemption analysis under the PWSA. This necessitates a more detailed discussion of these provisions.</p>\n<p>Congress has, by statute, occupied the field with respect to subject matters addressed in Title II of the PWSA.<sup>[10]</sup> The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> subject matter of Title II, \"Vessels Carrying Certain Cargoes in Bulk,\" is generally defined at 46 U.S.C. § 3703(a):</p>\n<blockquote>The Secretary shall prescribe regulations for the design, construction, alteration, repair, maintenance, operation, equipping, personnel qualification, and manning of vessels to which this chapter applies, that may be necessary for increased protection against hazards to life and property, for navigation and vessel safety, and for enhanced protection of the marine environment.</blockquote>\n<p>Congress has required the Coast Guard to issue regulations under Title II, which \"shall include requirements about . . . (3) equipment and appliances for . . . prevention and mitigation of damage to the marine environment; [and] (4) the manning of vessels and the duties, qualifications, and training of the officers and crew.\" 46 U.S.C. § 3703(a).</p>\n<p>By contrast, conflict preemption is applied to state statutes and regulations concerning subject matters within Title I of the PWSA. <i>See </i><i>Locke,</i> 529 U.S. at 109, 120 S.Ct. 1135. The subject matter of Title I is defined by statute:</p>\n<blockquote>Subject to the requirements of section 1224 of this title, the Secretary</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(1) in any port or place under the jurisdiction of the United States, in the navigable waters of the United States, or in any area covered by an international agreement negotiated pursuant to section 1230 of this title, may construct, operate, maintain, improve, or expand vessel traffic services, consisting of measures for controlling or supervising vessel traffic or for protecting navigation and the marine environment and may include, but need not be limited to one or more of the following: reporting and operating requirements, surveillance and communications systems, routing systems, and fairways. . . .</blockquote>\n<p>33 U.S.C. § 1223(a). As the United States has stated, the subject matter of Title I is characterized generally by matters of local concern, and, absent issuance of federal regulations or a decision not to allow state regulation under Title I, state regulation is not preempted in areas subject to that title.</p>\n<p>Title I and Title II overlap in some instances. For example, both titles cover, in different contexts, \"operating\" requirements. <i>See id.</i> § 1223(a)(1) (Secretary may impose measures including, inter alia, \"operating requirements\"); <i>id.</i> § 1223(a)(4)(D) (Secretary may \"restrict[] operation, in any hazardous area or under hazardous conditions, to vessels which have particular operating characteristics or capabilities which he considers necessary for safe operation under the circumstances\"); 46 U.S.C. § 3703(a) (requiring Secretary to \"prescribe regulations for the . . . operation . . . and manning of vessels to which this chapter applies\"); <i>see also </i><i>Locke,</i> 529 U.S. at 116, 120 S.Ct. 1135 (remanding for consideration of whether a state navigation-watch requirement should be analyzed under Title I conflict preemption or Title II field preemption). Further, each title purports to have as one of its purposes the protection of the environment. <i>See</i> 33 U.S.C. § 1223(a)(1) (authorizing regulations on covered subjects \"for protecting navigation and the marine environment\"); 46 U.S.C. § 3703(a) (requiring regulations on covered subjects \"that may be necessary . . . for enhanced protection of the marine environment\").</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> As a result, <i>Locke</i> recognized that \"[t]he existence of some overlapping coverage between the two titles of the PWSA may make it difficult to determine whether a pre-emption question is controlled by conflict pre-emption principles, applicable generally to Title I, or by field pre-emption rules, applicable generally to Title II.\" 529 U.S. at 111, 120 S.Ct. 1135. In such instances of overlap, not every question will be resolved \"by the greater pre-emptive force of Title II.\" <i>Id.</i> Rather, \"conflict pre-emption under Title I will be applicable in some, although not all, cases.\" <i>Id.</i> at 111-12, 120 S.Ct. 1135.</p>\n<p>In resolving preemption questions in cases of overlapping coverage, <i>Locke</i> instructs courts to consider these factors<sup>[11]</sup>: (1) \"the type of regulations the Secretary has actually promulgated under [Title II]\"; (2) whether the regulation falls within the specific type listed in § 3703(a) as required to be promulgated; (3) whether the federal rule is \"justified by conditions unique to a particular port or waterway\" (e.g., a Title I regulation based on water depth in Puget Sound or other local peculiarities); (4) whether the state regulation is \"of limited extraterritorial effect, not requiring the tanker to modify its primary conduct outside the specific body of water purported to justify the local rule\"; and (5) whether the state regulation is one that \"pose[s] a minimal risk of innocent noncompliance, do[es] not affect vessel operations outside the jurisdiction, do[es] not require adjustment of systemic aspects of the vessel, and do[es] not impose a substantial burden on the vessel's operation within the local jurisdiction itself.\" <i>Id.</i> at 112, 120 S.Ct. 1135.</p>\n<p>In the same vein, <i>Ray</i> instructed federal courts addressing such maritime environmental cases to look to the respective purposes of the federal and state laws. 435 U.S. at 164-65, 98 S.Ct. 988. This \"purpose\" rule emerged from earlier Supreme Court Commerce Clause cases such as <i>Huron Portland Cement Co. v. City of Detroit,</i> 362 U.S. 440, 80 S.Ct. 813, 4 L.Ed.2d 852 (1960), and <i>Kelly v. Washington,</i> 302 U.S. 1, 58 S.Ct. 87, 82 L.Ed. 3 (1937).<sup>[12]</sup> Overlap analysis thus involves some identification of the relative purposes and domains of Title I and Title II. <i>See </i><i>Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr,</i> 518 U.S. 470, 484, 116 S.Ct. 2240, 135 L.Ed.2d 700 (1996) (stressing the need to identify the \"domain\" of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> the statutory clause said to preempt state law). <i>Ray</i> appeared to consider Title II to be concerned with matters that are properly subject to national rules, <i>see</i> 435 U.S. at 165-66 &amp; n. 15, 98 S.Ct. 988, while Title I is more concerned with rules \"arising from the peculiarities of local waters that call for special precautionary measures,\"<sup>[13]</sup><i>id.</i> at 171, 98 S.Ct. 988.</p>\n<p>Against this background, we turn to the preemption analysis of the specific MOSPA sections.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. VESSEL MANNING REQUIREMENTS FOR BUZZARDS BAY</h2>\n<p>The district court held that the two vessel manning requirements of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21M, § 4for tank barges and for tow vessels in Buzzards Bayare field preempted because they are unambiguously covered by Title II, and not Title I. The district court did not engage in the overlap analysis described in <i>Locke. See </i><i>Massachusetts,</i> 440 F.Supp.2d at 35-37. The United States did not seriously present argument to the district court that if Title I applied, federal regulations preempted the vessel manning requirements.</p>\n<p>Subject to certain exceptions,<sup>[14]</sup> the state's manning provision for \"tank barges\" requires that crews consist of \"2 personnel, 1 of whom shall be a certified tanker-man under [federal regulations] who shall be on the tank barge at all times.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21M, § 4(b). The manning provision for \"tow vessels\" towing 6000 or more barrels of oil requires (a) \"at least 1 licensed deck officer or tow vessel operator, who shall serve exclusively as a lookout with no other concurrent duties,\" and (b) \"three licensed officers or tow vessel operators.\" <i>Id.</i> § 4(a).</p>\n<p>The parties raise different preemption arguments for section 4(b), the tank barge provision, and for section 4(a), the tow vessel provision.</p>\n<p>A. <i>The Section 4(b) Tank Barge Manning Requirement in Buzzards Bay</i></p>\n<p>Massachusetts argues that although section (4)(b)'s tank barge manning requirement could be encompassed by Title II, there is nonetheless overlap with Title I. Because of this overlap, the state contends that more facts needed to be developed, and so the issue should not have been resolved at the pleadings stage.</p>\n<p>The United States disagrees, arguing that because \"the manning of vessels\" is listed in Title II,<sup>[15]</sup><i>see</i> 46 U.S.C. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> § 3703(a)(4), all state manning regulations are field preempted by Title II and no overlap analysis is necessary. That contention overreaches. The position of the United States, which the district court accepted, is inconsistent with <i>Locke</i>'s recognition that Title I and Title II can overlap. <i>See</i> 529 U.S. at 111, 120 S.Ct. 1135.</p>\n<p>While the district court was correct to <i>begin</i> with the text of the Title II, this should not have ended the inquiry. Title II of the PWSA addresses the \"manning of vessels to which this chapter applies,\" 46 U.S.C. § 3703(a), and the chapter applies to \"tank vessels,\" <i>see id.</i> § 3702(a). A tank vessel is in turn defined as</p>\n<blockquote>a vessel that is constructed or adapted to carry, or that carries, oil or hazardous material in bulk as cargo or cargo residue, and that(A) is a vessel of the United States; (B) operates on the navigable waters of the United States; or (C) transfers oil or hazardous material in a port or place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> § 2101(39). Congress required the Coast Guard to promulgate regulations addressing \"the manning of [tank] vessels and the duties, qualifications, and training of the officers and crew.\" <i>Id.</i> § 3703(a)(4).</p>\n<p>Courts must also examine the text of Title I when analyzing the preemptive effect of the PWSA on particular state regulations. <i>See </i><i>Locke,</i> 529 U.S. at 111-12, 120 S.Ct. 1135. As the state points out, Title I gives the Secretary authority to promulgate regulations for protecting the marine environment, which may include \"operating requirements.\" 33 U.S.C. § 1223(a)(1). Further, for areas the Secretary considers to be hazardous, the Secretary may establish \"vessel operating conditions\" and/or may restrict operations to \"vessels which have particular operating characteristics or capabilities which he considers necessary for safe operation.\" <i>Id.</i> § 1223(a)(4)(C), (D). The state argues that its manning requirements are thus a type of operational requirement under Title I, for certain vessels in Buzzards Bay, and not a general manning requirement under Title II.</p>\n<p>The United States responds that the phrase \"operating requirements\" is a term of art that refers only to navigational operations in a traffic safety system of the type expressly addressed in Title I of the PWSA. The general operation and manning of vessels, the United States says, are dealt with in Title II and are thus field preempted. <i>See</i> 46 U.S.C. § 3703(a).</p>\n<p>As the state notes, however, Title I's Statement of Policy also refers to \"manning\": \"The Congress finds and declares . . . that increased supervision of <i>vessel</i> . . . <i>operations</i> is necessary in order to . . . insure that vessels operating in the navigable waters of the United States shall comply with all applicable standards and requirements for vessel construction, equipment, <i>manning,</i> and operational procedures.\" 33 U.S.C. § 1221(c)(3) (emphases added). Analysis of the texts of Title I and Title II does not fully resolve the source of the potential preemption here. Nor does initial consideration of the purposes behind Title I and Title II resolve the matter. Both Titles are concerned with enhanced protection of the marine environment. <i>See </i><i>Locke,</i> 529 U.S. at 110-11, 120 S.Ct. 1135. As a result, that cannot itself be the distinguishing factor. Nor is it helpful to talk abstractly about the safety of vessels, which, depending on the particular regulations at issue, may be a Title I or a Title II concern.</p>\n<p>The analysis becomes clearer when one considers <i>Locke</i>'s approach. The Court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> invalidated training requirements which applied statewide, controlled manning outside of state waters, and did not address \"matters unique to the waters of Puget Sound.\" <i>Id.</i> at 113, 120 S.Ct. 1135. The Court also invalidated an English language proficiency requirement for tanker crews that affected staffing decisions outside of state waters and was \"not limited to governing local traffic or local peculiarities.\" <i>Id.</i> at 113-14, 120 S.Ct. 1135. Further, the Court invalidated as field preempted a statewide navigation-watch requirement. The Court noted that this was a general operation and manning requirement under Title II because \"[t]he general watch requirement is not tied to the peculiarities of Puget Sound; it applies throughout Washington's waters and at all times.\" <i>Id.</i> at 114, 120 S.Ct. 1135. <i>Locke</i> thus held that the state's general watch regulationrequiring at least four specified personnel in state waters at all timeswas preempted by Title II as an attempt to regulate a tanker's \"operation\" and \"manning\" under 46 U.S.C. § 3703(a). <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>However, at the same time, the Court remanded for performance of an overlap analysis to determine whether a narrower navigation-watch requirement, for times of restricted visibility, should be analyzed under Title I. In line with the Court's articulation of the method for differentiating between Title I and Title II concerns, the Court suggested that, on remand, consideration should be given to Washington's arguments that the narrower requirement was \"of limited extraterritorial effect and necessary to address the peculiarities of Puget Sound.\" <i>Id.</i> at 116, 120 S.Ct. 1135.</p>\n<p>Relying on this aspect of <i>Locke,</i> the state suggests that any time a state regulation on a given topic is restricted to a particular local waterway, overlap analysis is required. This argument stretches too far and is inconsistent with the balance of <i>Locke</i> as well as <i>Ray.</i> Some topics are Title II topics, regardless of limited geographic application, as the state has essentially conceded in not attempting to defend other sections of its statute. With regard to the manning requirement before us, however, the district court must undertake an overlap inquiry, including a full consideration of the various <i>Locke</i> factors. Further development of the record is in order to resolve this point.</p>\n<p>The United States suggests to us that even if Title I conflict preemption analysis were used, various federal requirements in the area of manning, including regulations promulgated under Title I, suffice to preempt. <i>See, e.g.,</i> 33 C.F.R. § 164.13(c). The argument has not been sufficiently made either before the district court or on appeal, and can be made on remand.</p>\n<p>B. <i>The Section 4(a) Tow Vessel Manning Requirement in Buzzards Bay</i></p>\n<p>We have concluded that the state's tank barge manning requirements for Buzzards Bay must be reconsidered under overlap analysis. For similar reasons, we also conclude that a remand is necessary on the state's tow vessel manning provisions.</p>\n<p>The state nonetheless asks us to go farther. It points out that the text of Title II addresses \"tank vessels,\" not \"tow vessels,\" <i>see</i> 46 U.S.C. § 3702(a), and it contends that the two are not the same.<sup>[16]</sup> Accordingly, the state argues that section 4(a) cannot be within the scope of Title II, and the provision's validity must instead be considered under Title I conflict preemption analysis.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> The United States disagrees with this interpretation of the PWSA. It argues that although the PWSA expressly addresses \"tank vessels,\" and not \"tow vessels,\" that fact is immaterial. The definition of \"tank vessel\" includes any vessel that \"carries . . . oil or hazardous material in bulk as cargo,\" and not just vessels that are \"constructed or adapted to carry . . . oil or hazardous material in bulk as cargo.\" <i>Id.</i> § 2101(39). That definition, in the United States' view, can encompass a tug vessel when it pushes, pulls, or hauls a vessel containing oil or hazardous material (although the vessel would not be within the scope of the definition when it carries some other type of cargo). This interpretation is based on an argument that when a vessel carrying oil or other hazardous material is not self-propelled and requires a tug (as would be the case with a barge), the tug and the non-self-propelled vessel effectively become one vessel which \"carries\" the cargo.</p>\n<p>The state responds that a 2004 amendment added \"towing vessels\" to the list of vessels covered by a separate chapter of Title 46 of the United States Code, but did not similarly add \"towing vessels\" to the list of vessels covered by Title II of the PWSA. <i>See</i> Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2004, Pub.L. No. 108-293, § 415, 118 Stat. 1028, 1047 (codified at 46 U.S.C. § 3301(15)). The amended section already applied to \"tank vessels.\" 46 U.S.C. § 3301(10). The state argues that this means the term \"tank vessel\" does not encompass towing vessels.</p>\n<p>The district court held that although Title II does not expressly use the term \"tow vessels,\" this was a legally insignificant distinction. <i>Massachusetts,</i> 440 F.Supp.2d at 36-37. The district court adopted the United States' argument that \"towing vessels that are pushing, pulling, or hauling tank barges carrying oil or other hazardous materials are, as part of the tow-barge combination, `tank vessels' and are, thus, within the scope of Title II.\" <i>Id.</i> at 37.</p>\n<p>The court explained that adoption of the state's proposed distinction between tank vessels and tow vessels would undermine important federal interests:</p>\n<blockquote>The towing vessel, although it does not physically carry the oil, is the crucial element of the tow-barge combination and, therefore, poses the most risk to the marine environment. Defendants' argument, furthermore, would give the Coast Guard exclusive jurisdiction to regulate one form of tank vessel, self-propelled tankers, but would grant concurrent jurisdiction with the states to regulate the driving force of the tow-tank barge combination. That result would make little practical sense and would hinder the Congressional goal of creating uniform national regulations for all tank vessels.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> This led the court to hold that the matter was clearly within Title II, and so section 4(a) was field preempted. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Our resolution of this appeal does not require us to determine if the state or the federal government has correctly interpreted the meaning of `tank vessel.' Even if the federal government's interpretation is correct, our discussion in Part III.A shows why overlap analysis would still be required before a court could find preemption as a matter of law. That is sufficient for us to reverse the district court's decision to grant judgment on the pleadings, and to remand this issue.<sup>[17]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> IV. TUG ESCORT REQUIREMENTS</h2>\n<p>The United States argues that the state's tug escort provisions, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21M, § 6, are in conflict with regulations promulgated under Title I, <i>see</i> 33 C.F.R. § 165.100(d)(1). The asserted conflict is that the Coast Guard has made a preemptive choice in these regulations that tug escort requirements be set by the Coast Guard on a regional basis, covering all of the First Coast Guard District.<sup>[18]</sup></p>\n<p>The state tug escort statute has three key provisions. It applies only to \"area[s] of special interest within the waters of the commonwealth,\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21M, § 6(a), which include Buzzards Bay, Vineyard Sound, and Mount Hope Bay,<sup>[19]</sup><i>id.</i> § 1. Further, the statute prohibits a tank vessel carrying 6000 or more barrels of oil from entering or transiting such waters unless the tank vessel is accompanied by a tugboat escort. <i>Id.</i> § 6(a). Finally, the section does not apply to a self-propelled tank vessel. <i>Id.</i> § 6(b).</p>\n<p>The United States makes two preliminary arguments that we quickly reject. First, the United States attempts to redefine what is meant by conflict preemption in the Title I context. It argues that once the Coast Guard promulgates regulations on a subject, that ends the matter; there is essentially no room for any further preemption analysis. For example, the United States argues that \"State regulatory authority does not survive once the Secretary establishes federal regulations under Title I.<sup>[20]</sup> The argument overreaches.<sup>[21]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> As pointed out by the state amici, the position of the United States converts <i>Locke</i>'s Title I conflict preemption analysis into something resembling a field preemption analysis. The United States' argument largely destroys the distinction between the two preemption models set forth in <i>Locke,</i> 529 U.S. at 109-10, 120 S.Ct. 1135, as discussed above.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the United States means only that if the Coast Guard Title I regulations had expressly preempted the state statute, courts would view the matter under a different model. An agency's preemption judgment is \"dispositive on the question of implicit intent to pre-empt unless either the agency's position is inconsistent with clearly expressed congressional intent, or subsequent developments reveal a change in that position.\" <i>Hillsborough County v. Automated Med. Labs., Inc.,</i> 471 U.S. 707, 714-15, 105 S.Ct. 2371, 85 L.Ed.2d 714 (1985) (citation omitted). Nonetheless, judicial review of that judgment would still be available. <i>See </i><i>City of New York v. FCC,</i> 486 U.S. 57, 63-64, 108 S.Ct. 1637, 100 L.Ed.2d 48 (1988). A court would review whether the agency's decision to preempt constitutes \"a reasonable accommodation of conflicting policies . . . committed to [its] care\" and whether \"it appears from the statute or its legislative history that the accommodation is not one that Congress would have sanctioned.\" <i>Id.</i> at 64, 108 S.Ct. 1637 (quoting <i>United States v. Shimer,</i> 367 U.S. 374, 383, 81 S.Ct. 1554, 6 L.Ed.2d 908 (1961)) (internal quotation marks omitted); <i>see also Fid. Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. de la Cuesta,</i> 458 U.S. 141, 153-54, 102 S.Ct. 3014, 73 L.Ed.2d 664 (1982). As we explain, the district court should engage in this review on remand.</p>\n<p>The United States secondly suggests that Massachusetts' tug escort provisions are statutorily preempted by the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1998 (CGAA), Pub.L. No. 105-383, 112 Stat. 3411, under which Congress, apparently frustrated that the Coast Guard had not acted under Title I as to waters in the Northeast, ordered the Coast Guard to do so. Section 311(b)(1)(A) of the CGAA provides that \"[n]ot later than December 31, 1998, the [Coast Guard] <i>shall</i> promulgate regulations for towing vessel and barge safety for the waters of the Northeast.\" <i>Id.</i> at 3423 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>The statutory phrase is not an expression of intent by Congress that any such Coast Guard regulationsregardless of scope, subject matter, or expression of intent to preemptwould occupy the field. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> It is a command to the Coast Guard to promulgate certain types of regulations, which it already had authority to do under Title I.</p>\n<p>The pertinent federal regulations cover the whole of the First Coast Guard District, including Massachusetts. 33 C.F.R. § 165.100(d)(1)(i), (ii) (effective January 29, 1999); 63 Fed.Reg. 71,764, 71,771 (Dec. 30, 1998). The regulations require that single-hull tank barges, unless being towed by a twin-screw propulsion primary towing vessel (with separate power for each screw), must be accompanied by a tugboat escort.<sup>[22]</sup> 33 C.F.R. § 165.100(d)(1)(i). The federal regulations specifically exclude double-hull tank barges from the tug escort requirement. <i>Id.</i> § 165.100(d)(1)(ii).</p>\n<p>The United States argues that Massachusetts' tug escort provisions for sensitive waters are preempted because they are inconsistent with the Coast Guard's regulatory choice that the topic of tug escorts in Northeast waters be regulated on a regional basis. A federal agency's choice in favor of national or regional regulation is a ground for conflict preemption. <i>See </i><i>Locke,</i> 529 U.S. at 109-10, 120 S.Ct. 1135. Significantly, the United States has <i>not</i> argued on appeal that it would literally be impossible for ships to comply with both the state statute and federal regulations concerning tug escorts.<sup>[23]</sup></p>\n<p>The state responds on two fronts. The first argument is that there is no conflict preemption here because the Coast Guard regulations do not impose a \"local navigation rule,\" as does Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21M, § 6. The state asserts that its law is valid if the Coast Guard has not adopted a rule regarding the <i>particular waters</i> addressed by the challenged state law. In essence, the state reads <i>Ray</i> to say that Title I conflict preemption requires an exact coincidence between the subject matters of the federal and state regulations. <i>Ray</i> says no such thing. Although <i>Ray</i> did express an interest in whether the Secretary had \"promulgated his own tug requirement for <i>Puget Sound,</i>\" 435 U.S. at 171, 98 S.Ct. 988 (emphasis added), the Court did not hold that an exact coincidence in subject matter was required to find conflict preemption, <i>id.</i> at 171-72, 174-75, 98 S.Ct. 988.</p>\n<p>Indeed, there was no federal regulation in <i>Ray</i> purporting to regulate the use of tug escorts specifically in Puget Sound, nor was there a federal regulation covering a broader area which included Puget Sound.<sup>[24]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 171-72, 98 S.Ct. 988. Here, the federal regulations contain within their breadth the narrower group of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> waters which are the subject of state regulation. Crucially, the state's argument contains an assumption that federal regulation on a regional basis is disfavored, and that there is a presumption in favor of state regulation of local waters. Not so, as <i>Locke</i> makes clear. 529 U.S. at 108, 120 S.Ct. 1135. As it is framed, the state's argument is untenable.</p>\n<p>More generally, the state argues that the Coast Guard has not determined that 33 C.F.R. § 165.100(d)(1) preempts the state tug escort rule at issue. The initial question is whether the Coast Guard has expressed an intent to preempt Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21M, § 6. The United States argues that it is obvious from the regulation and the Coast Guard's accompanying statements that such an intent has been expressed.</p>\n<p>The law of preemption by agency regulation, as the state amici point out, requires a clear statement from the federal agency of its intention to preempt the state regulation at issue. The Supreme Court has held that \"it is appropriate to expect an administrative regulation to declare any intention to pre-empt state law with some specificity.\" <i>Cal. Coastal Comm'n v. Granite Rock Co.,</i> 480 U.S. 572, 583, 107 S.Ct. 1419, 94 L.Ed.2d 577 (1987) (citing <i>Hillsborough County,</i> 471 U.S. at 718, 105 S.Ct. 2371). Like other federal agencies, the Coast Guard must, \"[t]o the extent practicable and permitted by law,\" publish a federalism summary impact statement discussing \"any regulation that has federalism implications and that preempts State law,\" after consultation with state and local officials. Exec. Order No. 13,132, § 6(c), 64 Fed.Reg. 43,255, 43,258 (Aug. 4, 1999). We apply this specificity requirement.</p>\n<p>The relevant administrative record on this issue does not consist merely of the First Coast Guard District regulations, 33 C.F.R. § 165.100, and the attendant 1998 Federal Register statement, 63 Fed.Reg. 71,764. It also consists of two later Federal Register statements, issued in 2004 and 2006, which are more pertinently about a proposed tug escort rule for Buzzards Bay. The 1998 Federal Register statement<sup>[25]</sup> could not have addressed MOSPA because MOSPA was not enacted until 2004. But the Coast Guard was well aware of MOSPA when it issued its two later statements.</p>\n<p>In October 2004, the Coast Guard gave advance notice of proposed rulemaking that would require tug escorts for tank barges transiting Buzzards Bay. <i>See</i> 69 Fed.Reg. at 62,427. The advance notice <span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> solicited comments on, inter alia, seven questions. <i>Id.</i> at 62,429. As to federalism concerns, the 2004 notice took the position that several undefined provisions of MOSPA were preempted by the rulings in <i>Locke</i> and <i>Ray,</i> and specifically that section 17 of MOSPA (codified at Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 103, § 28), concerning pilotage requirements for certain vessels engaged in the coastwise trade, was preempted by operation of law. <i>Id.</i> at 62,429-30; <i>see also</i> 2004 Mass. Acts at 933. It is noteworthy that although the Coast Guard in its 2004 notice was clearly aware of the enactment of MOSPA, its federalism statement did not comment on the preemption of the tug escort provision, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21M, § 6. <i>See</i> 69 Fed.Reg. at 62,429-30. If the only pertinent statements were those in 1998 and 2004, we would conclude that the Coast Guard had not clearly expressed an intent to preempt the state tug escort provisions.</p>\n<p>What throws the matter in doubt is the most recent federalism statement from the Coast Guard. The parties and the district court did not focus on the 2006 statement. In March 2006, the Coast Guard issued a notice of proposed rulemaking for Buzzards Bay, 71 Fed.Reg. 15,649.<sup>[26]</sup> That notice, like the 2004 notice, states that section 17 of MOSPA is void by operation of law. <i>Id.</i> at 15,653. The 2006 notice also suggests that parts of section 11 of MOSPA which is codified at Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21M, §§ 1-8, and so covers the relevant provisionare preempted. The 2006 notice specifically mentions the tug escort requirements for vessels in Buzzards Bay (codified at Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21M, § 6), and suggests, for the first time, that these requirements are preempted. It does so not by expressing a direct intent to preempt, but by stating a conclusion that <i>Locke</i> and <i>Ray</i> operate to preempt Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21M, § 6. 71 Fed.Reg. at 15,653. Further, the language suggesting that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21M, § 6 is preempted is not as explicit as that used to signal the preemption of section 17 of MOSPA. <i>See</i> 71 Fed.Reg. at 15,653.</p>\n<p>Under these circumstances, the better course is to remand. The parties should have the opportunity to address, among any other issues, the questions of whether the Coast Guard sufficiently expressed a clear intent to preempt the state tug escort provisions in 2006, and whether, if so, the Coast Guard's position is clearly inconsistent with congressional intent. <i>See </i><i>Cal. Coastal Comm'n,</i> 480 U.S. at 583, 107 S.Ct. 1419; <i>Hillsborough County,</i> 471 U.S. at 714-15, 105 S.Ct. 2371.</p>\n<p>As was true in <i>Ray,</i> \"[i]t may be that [federal] rules will be forthcoming that will pre-empt the State's present tug-escort rule. . . .\" 435 U.S. at 172, 98 S.Ct. 988. For now, we remand and encourage the parties to take advantage of the federalism consultations between the Coast Guard and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, which have already started. <i>See</i> 71 Fed. Reg. at 15,654; 69 Fed.Reg. at 62,430.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*20</span> V. THE STATE'S FINANCIAL ASSURANCE REQUIREMENT</h2>\n<p>The parties again disagree on the proper frame of analysis of the state's financial assurance statute and its exception. Nonetheless, the parties do agree that the analysis here is different from that of the other regulations at issue because Congress (through its enactment of OPA) has expressly saved the states' power to establish liability rules and related requirements. <i>See</i> 33 U.S.C. § 2718. Indeed, the Supreme Court has clarified that OPA did not preempt state power to \"establish liability rules and financial requirements relating to oil spills.\" <i>Locke,</i> 529 U.S. at 105, 120 S.Ct. 1135.</p>\n<p>MOSPA's financial assurance requirement has two relevant parts, one of which is under attack, and the other of which is conceded not to be preempted (assuming it is severable). In pertinent part, the state statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote>(a) Any vessel, whether or not self-propelled, in or entering upon the waters of the commonwealth for the purpose of transporting, discharging or receiving a cargo of oil, hazardous material, or hazardous waste, shall be subject to the financial assurance requirements and penalty authority as provided in subsections (b) to (d), inclusive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(b) A certificate of financial assurance obtained individually or jointly by the vessel, its owner or agent, its charterer, or by the owner or operator of the terminal at which the vessel discharges or receives its cargo, shall be provided to the department in the amount of at least $1,000,000,000. Vessels with a capacity of less than 6,000 barrels shall present a certificate of financial assurance to the department of environmental protection in the amount of $5,000,000. A copy of the financial assurance shall be posted on the vessel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(c). . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(d) The department may allow financial assurance in a lower amount based upon criteria that includes, but is not limited to, the type and amount of the above cargo transported by the vessel; the size and construction of the vessel, including whether the vessel is double hulled; the safety record of the vessel or the vessel owner, the loss or accident history of the vessel or vessel owner involving maritime spills and the safety equipment used by the vessel. The financial assurance shall be in a form approved by the department.</blockquote>\n<p>Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21, § 50C.</p>\n<p>The United States concedes that, standing alone, the provisions for the $1 billion and $5 million financial assurance certificates (subsections (a) and (b)) are within the state's power under OPA's savings clauses, 33 U.S.C. § 2718(a)(1), (c).<sup>[27]</sup> The dispute is over section 50C(d), which provides that the state Department of Environmental Protection may lower the amount of the bond according to certain criteria, some of which are defined by statute. The specified criteria include: \"the type and amount of cargo transported . . .; the size and construction of the vessel, including whether the vessel is double hulled; the safety record of the vessel or the vessel owner\"; and the vessel's safety equipment. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21, § 50C(d). The department is also given discretion to use other criteria. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> There are two relevant OPA savings clauses. The first, 33 U.S.C. § 2718(a)(1)(A), provides:</p>\n<blockquote>Nothing in this Act . . . shall </blockquote>\n<blockquote>(1) affect, or be construed or interpreted as preempting, the authority of any State or political subdivision thereof from imposing any additional liability or requirements with respect to </blockquote>\n<blockquote>(A) the discharge of oil or other pollution by oil within such State. . . .</blockquote>\n<p>The second clause, 33 U.S.C. § 2718(c)(1), provides:</p>\n<blockquote>Nothing in this Act . . . shall in any way affect, or be construed to affect, the authority of the United States or any State or political subdivision thereof </blockquote>\n<blockquote>(1) to impose additional liability or additional requirements [relating to the discharge, or substantial threat of a discharge, of oil]. . . .</blockquote>\n<p>These clauses in OPA do not define \"requirements.\" The clauses save state laws from preemption by OPA's Title I, but not from OPA's other titles, or from other federal statutes. <i>Locke,</i> 529 U.S. at 106, 120 S.Ct. 1135.</p>\n<p>The United States asserts that MOSPA is problematic because the exceptions in section 50C(d) encompass criteria at the core of PWSA's Title II.<sup>[28]</sup> Moreover, the state statute merely provides that the criteria are to be administered by the state agency, and it offers no further guidance.</p>\n<p>The United States asserts that the state may not regulate indirectly what it cannot regulate directly under Title II. The state and the Coalition acknowledge that an indirect regulation argument <i>might</i> survive <i>Ray. Ray</i> did consider such an indirect regulation theory, although there the theory did not concern a state financial, assurance certification under OPA's savings clauses. <i>See</i> 435 U.S. at 173 &amp; n. 25, 98 S.Ct. 988 (inquiring whether a state's tug escort rule indirectly regulated primary conduct, and rejecting that possibility on the facts presented). Nonetheless, even assuming arguendo that some theory of impermissible indirect regulation is viable even in a savings clause case, the United States has not to date met its burden on its argument that the statute is not within the powers reserved to the states.</p>\n<p>In this case, the two sides take fundamentally different views of what constitutes impermissible indirect regulation. There is a lack of clarity regarding the exact nature of both the United States' claim and the state's defense. The issue can be viewed as a spectrum problem. On the one hand, there is the state's statutory choice to establish a financial assurance program, the cost of which may be reduced by criteria which are attuned to degree of risk. Such gradations are common to most insurance schemes. On the other hand, there is a federal fear that implementation of this scheme will lead to state regulation of primary conduct  conduct <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> that is exclusively under federal control pursuant to Title II.<sup>[29]</sup></p>\n<p>In the United States' view, MOSPA's impermissible indirect effect is inherent in the structure of its financial assurance provision. Because here, according to the United States, \"the potential to influence primary conduct cannot be eliminated or even discounted,\" the statute is preempted as a matter of law. Under this theory, there is no need to present facts demonstrating that the provision would impose an actual burden or impediment to federal Title II authority.</p>\n<p>One might ask why, if the state may impose a $1 billion financial assurance requirement, a state may not also reduce the amount based on the objective criteria set forth in the statute  criteria which appear, on their face, to be rationally related to the degree of the risk posed. After all, there would appear to be less risk of spillage from a double-hulled vessel. Similarly, a vessel's capacity would presumably be related to the amount of expected liability if a spill did occur. Tellingly, OPA itself has a federal financial assurance requirement; as recently amended by Congress, the statute requires differing amounts of financial assurance based on whether or not a vessel is single-hulled, based on whether or not the vessel is a \"tank vessel,\" and based on the gross tonnage<sup>[30]</sup> of the vessel. 33 U.S.C. §§ 2704, 2716.</p>\n<p>The United States responds that MOSPA's $1 billion requirement is effectively no more than a ceiling, and that in practice the amounts charged will vary depending on criteria that are exclusively under federal control under PWSA's Title II. The United States argues that a state may never use criteria within Title II to ground its decisions.<sup>[31]</sup> That is because the state's mechanism amounts to a financial incentive \"for any design, cargo or equipment changes that [state regulators] think appropriate.\" We are doubtful that when Congress authorized the states to set financial assurance requirements it at the same time meant <i>per se</i> to preempt states from using graduated levels rationally related to risk. It is again worth observing that OPA itself imposes federal financial assurance requirements that are not uniform for all vessels. Under the OPA regime, vessels over 300 gross tons with oil on board, and certain other vessels of any size, are required to provide evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to meet OPA's liability maximums. 33 U.S.C. § 2716; <i>see also id.</i> § 2704 (setting forth liability maximums). At the time OPA was enacted, these maximums differed based on the vessel's gross tonnage, and based on whether or not the vessel was a tank vessel.<sup>[32]</sup> Pub.L. No. 101-380, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> § 1004(a), 104 Stat. at 491-92. In light of this, it is difficult to believe that Congress intended to preclude the states from similarly calibrating their financial assurance requirements to account for different vessel characteristics.</p>\n<p>Moreover, we should not be quick to assume that Congress intended preemption here. One commentator has read <i>Ray</i> to mean that when a state provides for alternative courses of behavior, one preempted and one not, the overall state scheme is not preempted unless the state's requirements act to exert pressure on operators in preempted areas. <i>See</i> Tribe, <i>supra,</i> § 6-26, at 486-87. <i>Ray</i> considered and rejected such a claim on its facts, and in light of the Court's treatment of the issue, Professor Tribe has concluded that \"the basic teaching of the [<i>Ray</i>] decision is that state pressure to act in derogation of a federal statutory scheme is not to be inferred lightly.\" <i>Id.</i> at 487.</p>\n<p>That principle has even more force in our case. In OPA, Congress expressly preserved state power to require financial assurance. <i>Ray</i>'s discussion of indirect regulation did not involve any such explicit congressional preservation. Moreover, <i>Ray</i> decided the indirect regulation issue on a detailed record replete with factual stipulations. 435 U.S. at 156, 173 &amp; n. 25, 98 S.Ct. 988. In this context, we reject the United States' arguments that the existence of pressure to conform conduct can be decided here as a matter of law, and that the actual effects of the state statute are irrelevant.</p>\n<p>As a fallback argument, the United States contends that it <i>has</i> established the existence of burdensome pressure, as MOSPA gives a state agency the authority to calibrate the assurance requirement on a case-by-case basis with only general guidance. It is not clear whether the United States means to argue that the state could constitutionally enact a financial assurance provision which, for example, allowed reductions according to a legislatively set schedule based on various design and other defined criteria.<sup>[33]</sup> Nor is it clear if the United States' position would permit a state to use regulations (rather than a statute) to enact such a provision, if these regulations reduced and cabined administrative discretion.</p>\n<p>The district court took a different approach. It correctly held that the effect of the statute was relevant. It asked whether the practical effect of the $1 billion rule was to force vessels to seek reductions pursuant to the exemption scheme. <i>Massachusetts,</i> 440 F.Supp.2d at 46. The court then decided, without hearing any evidence and on a motion for judgment on the pleadings, \"that the Commonwealth's one billion dollar financial assurance requirement imposes such an onerous financial obligation on a tank vessel owner that it in effect forces compliance with the statutory exception criteria.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>As an initial matter, the $1 billion amount does not appear to be plainly unreasonable <span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> when measured against risk. The remedial costs of the <i>Exxon Valdez</i> spill in 1989 surpassed $2 billion (as measured in 1990 dollars). A. Rodriguez &amp; P. Jaffe, <i>The Oil Pollution Act of 1990,</i> 15 Tul. Mar. L.J. 1, 16 (1990). In Buzzards Bay, while the clean-up costs from the 2003 spill were significantly lower, they were still sizable.<sup>[34]</sup></p>\n<p>Moreover, the record does not yet contain evidence about the requirements other states have set, industry usage and practice, or the costs of obtaining financial assurance. Nor have the parties even discussed or presented evidence about the requirements set by the federal government. While our own research on this last point has uncovered the federal rules, <i>see</i> 33 U.S.C. §§ 2704, 2716, those rules simply highlight the need for further facts. Indeed, the federal requirements set a complicated formula based in part on a vessel's gross tonnage, and there is nothing in the record informing us about the gross tonnages of vessels that traverse Buzzards Bay.</p>\n<p>Of course, even if the $1 billion amount were not in itself unreasonable, it is possible that such an amount would still place strong pressure on the industry to change its primary conduct. Yet there is simply no evidence on this point.</p>\n<p>The district court also found it significant that there was a lack of notice to vessel owners about the specific criteria that the state would use in lowering the bond amount; this was the crux of its concern about the vagueness of the criteria and the untrammeled delegation to the state agency. <i>See </i><i>Massachusetts,</i> 440 F.Supp.2d at 46. Given its finding that the state system necessarily forced vessels into compliance with the exemptions, the court held that the exemption scheme necessarily undercut the certainty that federal regulation under Title II afforded the industry. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The state characterizes the indirect regulation issue differently. It agrees with the district court that the analysis might turn on the practical effect of the $1 billion amount and the implemented exceptions. But it argues that there was no evidence of record to support the district court's conclusion. It also points out that an offer of proof was made to the court of evidence that no real burden is posed by the exemptions to the statute.</p>\n<p>The analysis presented thus far is insufficient to permit resolution of the matter on its merits. As the state has not yet exercised its administrative authority, it is unclear how it would choose to grant exceptions to the financial assurance requirement. We simply cannot yet say that MOSPA's section 50C(d) is incapable of any constitutional application. It may well be that the state will structure its decision making as to the exemption in a way that would frame the preemption question differently. It may even be that discussions between state and federal authorities would produce an agreed-upon scheme that adequately protects both state and federal interests. Given the absence of evidence at this stage, it is too early to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> know whether the state exception scheme would intrude impermissibly on the Coast Guard's exclusive authority under Title II.<sup>[35]</sup> On this record, the district court was not warranted in permanently enjoining any aspects of the financial assurance provision.<sup>[36]</sup></p>\n<p>Nonetheless, we do share the concerns of the United States that the state has yet to make a showing, by regulation or otherwise, explaining how it will utilize its discretion under section 50C(d). Since the state has not structured its exemption scheme, there is no operational scheme to enjoin. The state should make such a showing on remand; we leave it to the district court to consider the appropriateness of a preliminary injunction thereafter.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VI. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The questions here do not turn on whether the state or the federal regulations best protect Buzzards Bay and the sensitive waters of Massachusetts from oil spills, given the costs imposed by regulation. Making such determinations is not the role of a federal court.</p>\n<p>Our question is whether the district court erred in concluding, as a matter of judgment on the pleadings, that the PWSA left no room for the state government to enact these state statutory provisions. The district court erred in entering permanent injunctions, as well as in entering judgment for the United States, at this stage in the proceedings.</p>\n<p>On remand, the parties should address the question of an interim agreement to stay MOSPA's provisions pendente lite. In the absence of an agreement by the parties, we leave it to the district court to determine whether the United States can, under the proper analysis, meet its burden that the state should be preliminarily enjoined from enforcement of the relevant statutory sections.</p>\n<p>No costs are awarded.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Defendants Mitt Romney and Robert W. Golledge, Jr. (former Commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection) have been substituted with Deval Patrick and Arleen O'Donnell (Acting Commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection) in both No. 06-2361 and No. 06-2362. <i>See</i> Fed. R.App. P. 43(c)(2).</p>\n<p>[1]  The PWSA is codified at 33 U.S.C. §§ 1221-32 and in scattered sections of 46 U.S.C.</p>\n<p>[2]  The United States also presented no claim that Massachusetts had limited the rights of non-residents and aliens to utilize its waters. <i>Cf., e.g., </i><i>Douglas v. Seacoast Prods., Inc.,</i> 431 U.S. 265, 283, 97 S.Ct. 1740, 52 L.Ed.2d 304 (1977). Nor did it assert that the Constitution's Admiralty Clause preempted the state statute. <i>Cf. </i><i>Ballard Shipping Co. v.

The Coalition for Buzzards Bay intervened on the side of the Commonwealth. For ease of reference, we will simply refer to the lead parties, the United States and Massachusetts.\n</p>\n<p>On appeal, three sets of amici have filed briefs in support of Massachusetts: the \"state amici\" (which include the states of Washington, Alaska, California, Maine, Oregon, and Rhode Island, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico), the \"local government amici\" (which include the towns of Bourne, Fairhaven, Falmouth, Gosnold, Marion, and Westport, and the city of New Bedford), and the Conservation Law Foundation.</p>\n<p>[4]  In 1989, in nearby Narragansett Bay in Rhode Island, an oil tanker ran aground and spilled over 300,000 gallons of heating oil. The responsible individuals pled guilty in criminal proceedings under the Clean Water Act, <i>see</i> 33 U.S.C. § 1319(c), and they also agreed to pay fines, clean-up costs, and damages totaling over $9 million. <i>See </i><i>Ballard Shipping,</i> 32 F.3d at 624.</p>\n<p>[5]  The United States prosecuted the owner of the <i>Bouchard-120</i> under the federal Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. §§ 1319(c)(1), 1321(b)(3). The charge was negligent discharge of pollutant. The oil barge, being towed by a tug boat, traveled outside the Buzzards Bay channel and struck rocky shoals. The owner paid a fine of $10 million, $7 million of which went to wetlands conservation projects. The owner also pled guilty to violating the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, <i>see</i> 16 U.S.C. §§ 703, 707(a), as the spill had killed hundreds of federally protected birds.</p>\n<p>[6]  Enrolled vessels are those \"engaged in domestic or coastwide trade or used for fishing.\" <i>Douglas,</i> 431 U.S. at 273, 97 S.Ct. 1740.</p>\n<p>[7]  The foreign governments of thirteen ocean-going nations expressed concerns about the state scheme through a diplomatic note sent to the United States; that note was provided to the district court. The note protested that because there were inconsistencies between state and federal regulations regarding tanker personnel, equipment, and operations, permitting Washington's rules to take effect would result in uncertainty and confusion. <i>Locke,</i> 529 U.S. at 98, 120 S.Ct. 1135.\n</p>\n<p><i>Locke</i> thus presented issues regarding the need for national uniformity for this country in the international community. <i>Id.</i> at 102-03, 120 S.Ct. 1135; <i>cf. </i><i>Crosby v.

The Court did not reach the United States' arguments based on these treaties and international agreements. <i>Id.</i> at 103, 120 S.Ct. 1135.</p>\n<p>[8]  Earlier, in <i>Askew v. American Waterways Operators, Inc.,</i> 411 U.S. 325, 93 S.Ct. 1590, 36 L.Ed.2d 280 (1973), the Court had sustained, against a maritime law preemption challenge, a state statute imposing strict liability for oil spills. <i>Id.</i> at 327-29, 93 S.Ct. 1590.</p>\n<p>[9]  State laws can be preempted by federal regulations as well as by federal statutes. <i>City of New York v. FCC,</i> 486 U.S. 57, 63-64, 108 S.Ct. 1637, 100 L.Ed.2d 48 (1988); <i>Hillsborough County v. Automated Med. Labs., Inc.,</i> 471 U.S. 707, 713, 105 S.Ct. 2371, 85 L.Ed.2d 714 (1985). When the Coast Guard makes a determination not to impose a regulation, this may amount to a decision that no regulation at either the state or federal level is appropriate. <i>See </i><i>Ark. Elec. Coop. Corp. v. Ark. Pub. Serv. Comm'n,</i> 461 U.S. 375, 384, 103 S.Ct. 1905, 76 L.Ed.2d 1 (1983); <i>Ray,</i> 435 U.S. at 171-72, 98 S.Ct. 988. However, a decision by the Coast Guard not to regulate in a field does not necessarily mean that the Coast Guard intended to preempt state law. <i>See </i><i>Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine,</i> 537 U.S. 51, 65-67, 123 S.Ct. 518, 154 L.Ed.2d 466 (2002).</p>\n<p>[10]  Other sources of federal maritime law may also preempt state regulation by occupying the field. This is true even if the state requirements are very similar to federal requirements. For example, <i>Locke</i> held that Washington's marine casualty reporting requirement was preempted, despite its similarity to federal requirements, because \"Congress intended that the Coast Guard regulations [under 46 U.S.C. § 6101] be the sole source of a vessel's reporting obligations.\" 529 U.S. at 115, 120 S.Ct. 1135. The state's reporting requirement created a significant burden in terms of costs, posed a risk of innocent non-compliance, and affected a vessel operator's out-of-state obligations and conductfactors which called into question the state's authority to regulate. <i>Id.</i> at 116, 120 S.Ct. 1135.</p>\n<p>[11]  These factors are drawn from themes identified in other Supreme Court cases. \"Whether federal [regulation] operates to preempt state regulation will ordinarily depend on the respective aims of the state and federal schemes.\" L. Tribe, <i>American Constitutional Law</i> § 6-28, at 506-07 (2d ed.1988).</p>\n<p>[12]  In <i>Huron,</i> the Court found that the state law at issue was not preempted; in doing so the Court contrasted the purpose of federal inspection laws, which sought \"to insure the seagoing safety of vessels subject to inspection,\" with the purpose of a Detroit ordinance, which sought to eliminate air pollution \"to protect the health and enhance the cleanliness of the local community.\" 362 U.S. at 445-46, 80 S.Ct. 813. In <i>Kelly,</i> the Court similarly upheld state legislation concerning motor-driven tugs, and it considered the state law's purpose of insuring safety and determining seaworthiness. 302 U.S. at 8, 14-16, 58 S.Ct. 87.\n</p>\n<p>\"[T]he principles developed [under Commerce Clause preemption] are not limited to [that] context; essentially the same techniques are used to determine the consequences for state action of <i>any</i> exercise of a plenary federal authority.\" Tribe, <i>supra,</i> § 6-29, at 508. Nonetheless, there are some distinctions between Commerce Clause preemption rules and maritime preemption rules. <i>See </i><i>Am. Dredging Co. v. Miller,</i> 510 U.S. 443, 452 n. 3, 114 S.Ct. 981, 127 L.Ed.2d 285 (1994) (distinguishing \"negative Commerce Clause\" jurisprudence, and commenting that \"[w]hatever might be the unifying theme of this aspect of our admiralty jurisprudence, it assuredly is <i>not</i> . . . the principle that the States may not impair maritime commerce\").</p>\n<p>[13]  As another commentator has noted:\n</p>\n<p>Whether preemption is to turn on an overlap of \"subject,\" \"object\" or \"purpose,\" or on interference with \"federal superintendence of the field,\" is crucial to the analysis. Virtually every state regulation of merchant vessel safety can also be characterized as having a \"pollution prevention\" purpose. Thus, federal legislation on the subject of vessel construction, design, equipment, and manning . . ., but having, by the court's characterization, a purpose other than pollution prevention, would not occupy the field of pollution prevention addressed by the challenged state law.</p>\n<p>C. Allen, <i>Federalism in the Era of International Standards: Federal and State Government Regulation of Merchant Vessels in the United States (Part III),</i> 30 J. Mar. L. &amp; Com. 85, 94 (1999).</p>\n<p>[14]  Section 4(b) exempts barges that carry less than 6000 gallons of oil, as well as barges that are not equipped to carry personnel on board. Section 4(c) additionally exempts double-hulled barges from the requirements of section 4(b).</p>\n<p>[15]  The Coast Guard has in fact promulgated regulations requiring tankers to \"navigate with at least two licensed deck officers on watch . . ., one of whom may be a pilot. In waters where a pilot is required, the second officer . . . must be an individual licensed and assigned to the vessel as master, mate, or officer in charge of a navigational watch,\" separate from the pilot. 33 C.F.R. § 164.13(c).</p>\n<p>[16]  A \"towing vessel\" is \"a commercial vessel engaged in or intending to engage in the service of pulling, pushing, or hauling along side, or any combination of pulling, pushing, or hauling along side.\" 46 U.S.C. § 2101(40).</p>\n<p>[17]  We call the parties' attention to 33 C.F.R. § 138.20. Section 138.20 was not promulgated under Title II, but instead under both OPA and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). The regulation's definition of \"tank vessel\" clearly excludes tow vessels:\n</p>\n<p>Tank vessel means a vessel (<i>other than . . . a towing or pushing vessel (tug) simply because it has in its custody a tank barge</i>) that is constructed or adapted to carry, or that carries, oil or liquid hazardous material in bulk as cargo or cargo residue, and that</p>\n<p>(1) Is a vessel of the United States;</p>\n<p>(2) Operates on the navigable waters; or</p>\n<p>(3) Transfers oil or hazardous material in a place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.</p>\n<p>33 C.F.R. § 138.20(b). With the exception of the parenthetical clause, this definition is nearly identical to the Title II definition of \"tank vessel\" found at 46 U.S.C. § 2101(39). We leave the significance, if any, of this textual difference to the preemption analysis to the district court in the first instance.</p>\n<p>[18]  The First Coast Guard District is comprised of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and parts of New York and New Jersey. 33 C.F.R. § 3.05-1(b).</p>\n<p>[19]  The statute also permits the state Secretary of Environmental Affairs to expand the definition to include other waters which meet particular criteria. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21M, § 1. Further, section 6(c) permits the state commissioner to promulgate certain regulations. This case is confined to the facial constitutionality of the cited statutory provisions. No state regulations are at issue here, nor are any bodies of water implicated other than the three specifically listed in the statute.</p>\n<p>[20]  The district court's decision could be read to have adopted the United States' position: \"In this case, the Coast Guard has regulated on the challenged subject. This court, therefore, need not [delve further into the Title I analysis].\" <i>Massachusetts,</i> 440 F.Supp.2d at 42.</p>\n<p>[21]  The United States relies primarily on <i>Ray</i> to argue that when the federal government adopts a regulation covering an area within the scope of Title I, state regulation on the same subject is preempted. It is true that <i>Ray</i> stated that \"[t]he relevant inquiry under Title I with respect to the State's power to impose a tug-escort rule is thus whether the Secretary has either promulgated his own tug requirement for [local] tanker navigation or has decided that no such requirement should be imposed at all.\" 435 U.S. at 171-72, 98 S.Ct. 988. On this record, however, neither of those premises is demonstrated.\n</p>\n<p>We also note that Title I has changed since <i>Ray,</i> another issue that should be addressed on remand. At the time of the <i>Ray</i> decision, 33 U.S.C. § 1222(b) had provided: \"Nothing contained in this <i>chapter</i> [referring to Title I of the PWSA] . . . prevent[s] a State or political subdivision thereof from prescribing <i>for structures only</i> higher safety equipment requirements or safety standards than those which may be prescribed pursuant to this chapter.\" 33 U.S.C. § 1222(b) (1976) (emphases added). <i>Ray</i> reasoned that since § 1222(b) permitted states to impose higher safety standards only for \"structures,\" this \"impliedly forb[ade] higher state standards for vessels.\" <i>Ray,</i> 435 U.S. at 174, 98 S.Ct. 988. The Court thus held that \"the State may not impose higher safety standards than those prescribed by the Secretary [limiting the size of vessels in Puget Sound].\" <i>Id.</i> at 175, 98 S.Ct. 988.</p>\n<p>The language pertaining to higher state safety standards no longer appears at § 1222. In 1978, Congress amended Title I, deleting any mention of state safety standards from § 1222, and instead adding a different provision to § 1225. Port and Tanker Safety Act of 1978, § 2, 92 Stat. at 1471-75. Section 1225, entitled \"Waterfront safety,\" now provides: \"Nothing contained in this <i>section,</i> with respect to <i>structures,</i> prohibits a State or political subdivision thereof from prescribing higher safety equipment requirements or safety standards than those which may be prescribed by [federal] regulations. . . .\" 33 U.S.C. § 1225(b) (emphases added). Again, we leave the significance of this change to the district court on remand.</p>\n<p>[22]  The federal regulations delegate some authority to the \"Captain of the Port\" to grant exceptions to the tug escort rule. 33 C.F.R. § 165.100(d)(1)(iii). In a different paragraph, the regulations also impose special enhanced radio communication requirements for some sensitive locations within Massachusetts' waters. <i>Id.</i> § 165.100(d)(2).</p>\n<p>[23]  The district court did find such an impossibility, stating that \"[t]ank barges traveling through Massachusetts waters . . . cannot comply with both the state and federal regulations.\" <i>Massachusetts,</i> 440 F.Supp.2d at 42. The state protests that there is no impossibility because nothing in the federal regulations prohibits taking on a tugboat escort. The United States has neither relied on nor defended the district court's ruling, so we do not consider it.</p>\n<p>[24]  The Court did comment that then-pending rulemaking \"requir[ing] tug escorts for certain vessels operating in <i>confined waters,</i>\" if passed, had the potential to preempt the state's tug escort rule. <i>Ray,</i> 435 U.S. at 172, 98 S.Ct. 988 (emphasis added); <i>see also</i> 41 Fed.Reg. 18,770, 18,771 (May 6, 1976). Notably, the Court did not suggest that the federal rule would need to specify <i>particular</i> \"confined waters\" in order to preempt the state's tug escort rule.</p>\n<p>[25]  The Coast Guard made several points in its 1998 explanation of the regulations at 33 C.F.R. § 165.100. Specifically noting the environmental sensitivity of waters in the Northeast, including Massachusetts waters, it stated: \"This rule takes a regional approach responsive to the particular risks inherent in the transportation of petroleum products on the waterways in the Northeastern United States.\" 63 Fed.Reg. at 71,765. The Coast Guard noted that several New England states were attempting to regulate tank barges transporting oil, and that \"[t]he states' differing legislative initiatives might result in inconsistent regulation of the industry.\" <i>Id.</i> The Coast Guard also noted comments that the rules for positive control of barges should be <i>national</i> in scope, but it rejected that position in favor of regional regulation. <i>Id.</i> at 71,765-66. The 1998 explanation contains no explicit statement rejecting state regulation of particularized local waters.\n</p>\n<p>Significantly, under the heading of \"Federalism,\" the Coast Guard discussed whether its regulations would preempt certain provisions of Rhode Island law. The Coast Guard concluded, inter alia, that its regulations would preempt Rhode Island law on positive control for barges, found at R.I. Gen. Laws § 46-12.6-8(a)(3) (repealed 2000). 63 Fed.Reg. at 71,770. The Rhode Island law had statewide application and was not limited to specified local waters. 1997 R.I. Pub. Laws 217, 217-18.</p>\n<p>[26]  The proposed amendments for the First Coast Guard District Regulated Navigation Area\n</p>\n<p>would require that all single-hull tank barges carrying 5000 or more barrels of oil or other hazardous material and being towed through Buzzards Bay, meet the following requirements:</p>\n<p>1. Be accompanied by an escort tug between the west entrance to Buzzards Bay and the east end of the Cape Cod Canal.</p>\n<p>2. Be accompanied by a federally licensed pilot, who may remain on the escort tug vessel, to monitor the navigation of the tug/barge, and to advise the master of the tug/barge accordingly.</p>\n<p>71 Fed.Reg. at 15,652. The proposed amendments also sought to establish a \"Vessel Movement Reporting System\" within Buzzards Bay to monitor the movements of certain vessels. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>[27]  OPA's savings clauses refer only to liability requirements related to the discharge of oil. However, MOSPA has a broader scope, as its financial assurance provisions also apply to vessels carrying hazardous materials. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21, § 50C(a). The parties have not discussed this disconnect in their briefs. Since the topic of hazardous materials has not been addressed by the parties' briefs, we do not discuss it further.</p>\n<p>[28]  In support of its argument that section 50C(d) invades the province of Title II, the United States notes that Title II specifically requires the Coast Guard to issue safety regulations that consider \"the types and grades of cargo permitted to be on board a tank vessel.\" 46 U.S.C. § 3703(b). It also requires the Coast Guard to regulate tank vessel design standards, <i>id.</i> § 3703(a), mandates that the Coast Guard promulgate rules regarding \"superstructures\" and \"hulls,\" <i>id.</i> § 3703(a)(1), requires the Coast Guard to prescribe rules regarding the equipping of tank vessels, <i>id.,</i> and instructs the Coast Guard to issue rules concerning \"equipment and appliances for lifesaving, fire protection, and prevention and mitigation of damage to the marine environment,\" <i>id.</i> § 3703(a)(3). The United States also points out that a different federal statute establishes reporting requirements. <i>See id.</i> § 6101 (requiring that the Coast Guard prescribe regulations on marine incident reporting and listing specific kinds of incidents that the regulations must cover).</p>\n<p>[29]  The state amici argue that there is no reason to assume that the state's scheme is a pretext to regulate Title II subjects, or to assume that the state has improper motives. However, the United States' objection is concerned with the potential effects of the scheme on primary conduct under Title II, regardless of motive. In any event, because there is insufficient evidence even of the statute's effects, we need not decide if improper motive is relevant to the preemption inquiry.</p>\n<p>[30]  It appears that \"gross tonnage\" is a measure for a ship's internal capacity. <i>See</i> Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2407 (1993); <i>see also</i> 46 C.F.R. § 69.9 (\"Gross tonnage means a vessel's approximate volume.\").</p>\n<p>[31]  Under the United States' theory, it would make no difference if the state set a minimum amount for a bond and ratcheted it up according to these defined criteria, or if the state instead set a ceiling and ratcheted down.</p>\n<p>[32]  A later amendment introduced even more gradations. This amendment significantly increased the size of the liability maximums, and also adjusted the limits to take into account whether or not a vessel is single hulled. <i>See</i> Delaware River Protection Act of 2006, Pub.L. No. 109-241, § 603, 120 Stat. 516, 553-54 (codified at 33 U.S.C. § 2704). The amendment also required the Coast Guard to report back to Congress, within 45 days of the amendment's enactment, on the adequacy of the federal liability limits. <i>Id.</i>\n</p>\n<p>The Coast Guard has yet to revise its financial assurance regulations to respond to this statutory amendment. While it \"anticipate[s] initiating a rulemaking\" to institute the changes, 71 Fed.Reg. 47,737, 47,738 (Aug. 18, 2006), it has told vessel operators that the prior requirements for submitting evidence of financial responsibility remain in effect until such rulemaking takes place, <i>id.</i></p>\n<p>[33]  The United States concedes that the state legislature \"has substantial latitude to calibrate the bond requirement.\" But the full reach of this concession is not entirely clear.</p>\n<p>[34]  One estimate, offered by the Executive Director of the Buzzards Bay National Estuary Program, put those costs at $36 million, which was on top of the $10 million the vessel owners paid in criminal penalties. <i>See</i> J. Costa, <i>Costs of the</i> Bouchard No. 120 <i>Oil Spill,</i> http://www.buzzardsbay.org/ oilspillcosts.htm (last updated Dec. 21, 2005); <i>see also</i> R. Mishra, <i>Legal Technicality Derails $10M Redress for Oil Spill,</i> Boston Globe, Sept. 15, 2004, at B2 (stating that $38 million had already been spent on clean-up). That spill involved \"only\" 98,000 gallons of oil. A larger spill, such as the 300,000 gallon spill that nearby Narragansett Bay saw in 1989, might be expected to impose far greater costs.</p>\n<p>[35]  Our conclusion, that a permanent injunction was premature, also encompasses the plaintiffs' claim that section 50C(d) is preempted insofar as it allows reductions based on a vessel's safety record. Plaintiffs have asserted that this part of the law is invalid because it interferes with exclusive Coast Guard reporting requirements. <i>See</i> 46 U.S.C. § 6101. The apparent assumption is that when a vessel applies for the exception, the state will necessarily require the vessel owner to describe past safety incidents. But this conclusion is too hasty. For example, the state agency could decide to simply look at the reports required to be filed under federal law.</p>\n<p>[36]  Although there is some ambiguity, and the parties disagree on appeal, we conclude that the district court sub silentio held that the exception clause, section 50C(d), was severable from the rest of the statute. At the end of its opinion, the court stated that \"[t]he Commonwealth is . . . permanently enjoined from conditioning the one billion dollar financial assurance requirement on criteria of tank vessel design, operation, equipping, or reporting requirements.\" <i>Massachusetts,</i> 440 F.Supp.2d at 48. The court further stated that it was not enjoining <i>all</i> possible uses of the discretionary exception  just those in the specifically mentioned areas. <i>Id.</i> at 48 n. 204. The district court's decision left clauses (a) through (c) fully in place.</p>\n\n</div>",

Several states, including Massachusetts, have passed laws to protect particularly sensitive waterways. The framework for analyzing such conflicts derives from the several preemption analyses set forth in <i>United States v. Locke,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118346\"><a href=\"/opinion/118346/united-states-v-locke/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118346\"><a href=\"/opinion/118346/united-states-v-locke/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In short, depending on the nature of state and federal regulations, either field preemption, conflict preemption, or overlap analysis is used to determine whether state law impermissibly infringes on federal authority.</p>\n<p>After a catastrophic oil spill in Buzzards Bay in 2003, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts enacted the Massachusetts Oil <span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> Spill Prevention Act (MOSPA). <i>See</i> 2004 Mass. Acts 920 (codified as amended primarily at Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21, §§ 42, 50B-50E, and ch. 21M). MOSPA imposes requirements designed to reduce the risk of oil spills, and to ensure that adequate resources are available to remedy such spills.</p>\n<p>The United States sued Massachusetts on January 18, 2005, seeking to enjoin the enforcement of several MOSPA provisions. The United States alleged that these provisions were preempted by the Ports and Waterways Safety Act of 1972, Pub L. No. 92-340, 86 Stat. 424, as amended by the Port and Tanker Safety Act of 1978, Pub.L. No. 95-474, 92 Stat. 1471 (collectively, the \"PWSA\"), and by regulations promulgated thereunder by the Coast Guard.<sup>[1]</sup> This allegation included a claim that MOSPA's financial assurance requirement, which requires certain vessels to post a bond to ensure their ability to respond financially to an oil spill, <i>see</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21, § 50C, was preempted by Title II of the PWSA, notwithstanding relevant savings clauses in the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (\"OPA\"), Pub.L. No. 101-380, 104 Stat. 484, 505-06 (codified at 33 U.S.C. § 2718). The United States did not assert violations of any treaties or claim that federal foreign affairs powers were at issue.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>The Commonwealth disputed each claim of preemption. It argued that Congress had given the states leeway to regulate particularly sensitive local waterways, at least in the absence of an actual conflict with a federal statute or regulation. In the state's view, there was no such conflict.</p>\n<p>The district court, acting on the United States' motion for judgment on the pleadings, and thus without taking evidence, entered judgment for plaintiffs and permanently enjoined all of the challenged provisions.<sup>[3]</sup><i>United States v. Massachusetts,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2562416\"><a href=\"/opinion/2562416/united-states-v-commonwealth-of-massachusetts/\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 48 (D.Mass.2006).</p>\n<p>The Commonwealth's appeal challenges the injunction only insofar as it blocked three of MOSPA's provisions: an enhanced manning requirement for tank barges and tow vessels in Buzzards Bay, <i>see</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21M, § 4; a tug escort requirement for special interest waters, <i>see id.</i> § 6; and a requirement that certain vessels obtain a certificate of financial assurance, the amount of which can vary, <i>see id.</i> ch. 21, § 50C.</p>\n<p>We vacate the entry of judgment and the permanent injunction for the United States, and we remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. As <span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> we explain, the district court did not adhere to the analytical structure the Supreme Court has required to resolve federal-state conflicts in this area. The district court acted prematurely.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Buzzards Bay is one of five recognized Estuaries of National Significance. <i>See</i> 69 Fed.Reg. 62,427, 62,428 (Oct. 26, 2004); <i>see also</i> 33 U.S.C. § 1330 (establishing a national estuary program). Massachusetts has designated the Bay as part of an \"Ocean Sanctuary.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 132A, § 13(c).</p>\n<p>Buzzards Bay is characterized by unusually dangerous ledges, reefs, and currents. Most of the Bay is less than 50 feet deep, and the Bay is less than 8 miles wide. <i>See</i> B. Howes et al., <i>Ecology of Buzzards Bay: An Estuarine Profile</i> 7, 23-24 (U.S. Dep't of the Interior, Biological Report No. 33, 1996), <i>available at</i> http://cuadra.cr.usgs. gov/Techrpt/96-33.pdf. The Bay's Cape Cod Canal has unusually strong tidal currents, and it \"represents a significant navigational challenge.\" <i>Id.</i> at 98.</p>\n<p>Significant volumes of oil are transported through the Bay and Canal each year. In 2002, about 80% of the trips were made in single-hull barges. 71 Fed.Reg. 15,649, 15,650 (Mar. 29, 2006). In the state's view, the waters of Buzzards Bay are subject to a disproportionate and unnecessary risk of an oil spill. A Coast Guard-sponsored report has concluded that \"the risk for oil or hazardous material discharge in Buzzards Bay is relatively high.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>There have already been several damaging spills in the Bay. In 1969, roughly 175,000 gallons of No. 2 fuel oil spilled into the Bay after the barge <i>Florida</i> ran aground. <i>Id.</i> In 1974, a sizable amount of oil spilled from the <i>Bouchard No. 65,</i> inflicting significant damage on local marine life. Howes et al., <i>supra,</i> at 102-03. In 1977, there was yet another <i>Bouchard</i> spill, this one releasing 81,000 gallons of fuel oil into the water. 71 Fed.Reg. at 15,650. In 1986, the tank barge <i>ST-85</i> was grounded in the Bay, spilling 119,000 gallons of gasoline.<sup>[4]</sup><i>Id.</i> In 1999, there was another grounding, this one involving a vessel carrying 4.7 million gallons of No. 6 fuel oil. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Most recently, in April 2003 the barge <i>Bouchard-120</i> released an estimated 98,000 gallons of heavy fuel oil into the Bay, killing hundreds of birds, closing thousands of acres of shellfish beds, affecting over 90 miles of coastline, and generating significant clean-up costs.<sup>[5]</sup> Massachusetts responded by enacting MOSPA on August 4, 2004. 2004 Mass. Acts at 933.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. DESCRIPTION OF FEDERAL LAW</h2>\n<p>A. <i>Background</i></p>\n<p>Federal regulation of maritime commerce has existed since the founding of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> country. <i>See</i> Act of Sept. 1, 1789, ch. 11, § 1, 1 Stat. 55. Federal regulation specifically geared toward the transport of dangerous cargoes started with the Tank Vessel Act of 1936, Pub.L. No. 74-765, 49 Stat. 1889. <i>See</i> K. Brooks, <i>California Oil Spill Laws in the Wake of United States v. Locke,</i> 12 U.S.F. Mar. L.J. 227, 230 (1999-2000). Regulatory involvement increased after 1967, the year of a massive oil spill involving a supertanker off the coast of England. Indeed, Congress has since enacted more stringent legislation for oil tankers and more comprehensive remedies for oil spills.</p>\n<p>The PWSA is a key component of this congressional response. It has two titles, both or which are at issue here, which we describe in greater detail later. Title I authorizes the Coast Guard to issue regulations on subjects within that title, although it does not so mandate. 33 U.S.C. § 1223(a). Title II works differently; it <i>requires</i> the Coast Guard to issue federal regulations governing subjects covered by that title. 46 U.S.C. § 3703(a).</p>\n<p>Several states have enacted statutes and regulations designed to give still greater protection against oil spills. The Supreme Court's 1978 decision in <i>Ray</i> concerned such state laws. <i>Ray</i> held that certain provisions of a Washington statute (concerning tanker design, tanker size, and pilotage requirements for enrolled vessels<sup>[6]</sup> ) were preempted by federal law. 435 U.S. at 159-60, 168, 178, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109811\"><a href=\"/opinion/109811/ray-v-atlantic-richfield-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">988</span></a></span>. <i>Ray</i> did uphold Washington's limited tug escort requirement for Puget Sound against a preemption challenge. <i>Id.</i> at 173, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109811\"><a href=\"/opinion/109811/ray-v-atlantic-richfield-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">988</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>Despite the protections of the PWSA, in 1989 the supertanker <i>Exxon Valdez</i> ran aground in Alaska, causing the largest oil spill in United States history. The key congressional response was the 1990 enactment of OPA. OPA has nine titles, including provisions imposing liability on parties responsible for damages and other costs stemming from oil spills. <i>See</i> 33 U.S.C. § 2702. Two \"savings clauses\" in OPA's Title I expressly preserve and recognize state authority to impose additional liability requirements and penalties. <i>Id.</i> § 2718(a)(1), (c).</p>\n<p>The scope of these savings clauses was at issue in <i>Locke.</i> On certiorari to the Supreme Court, the United States argued that several provisions of the Washington Administrative Code were preempted; the federal government stressed the foreign relations<sup>[7]</sup> and international commerce aspects <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> of the case. <i>Locke,</i> 529 U.S. at 102-03, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118346\"><a href=\"/opinion/118346/united-states-v-locke/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1135</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p><i>Locke</i> governs this case. The distinctions that <i>Locke</i> drew are the subject of dispute among the parties here. <i>Locke</i> held that several provisions of Washington's regulations were preempted by federal law. <i>Id.</i> at 112-17, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118346\"><a href=\"/opinion/118346/united-states-v-locke/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1135</span></a></span>. The <i>Locke</i> Court held that PWSA's Title II preempted three state regulations (requiring training for tanker crews, mandating English language proficiency, and imposing a general statewide navigation-watch requirement). <i>Id.</i> at 112-14, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118346\"><a href=\"/opinion/118346/united-states-v-locke/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1135</span></a></span>. The Court also held that a fourth regulation (governing the reporting of marine casualties) was preempted by a different federal statute, 46 U.S.C. § 6101. <i>Id.</i> at 114-16, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118346\"><a href=\"/opinion/118346/united-states-v-locke/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1135</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p><i>Locke</i> did not definitively rule on all of the regulations before it. Instead, the Court remanded the issue of whether certain regulations, such as the state's watch requirement in times of restricted visibility, were of limited extraterritorial effect and were necessary to address the peculiarities of Puget Soundfactors that would weigh in favor of a Title I conflict preemption analysis rather than a Title II field preemption analysis. <i>Id.</i> at 116-17, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118346\"><a href=\"/opinion/118346/united-states-v-locke/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1135</span></a></span>. The Court stated that the resolution of these matters would benefit from a full development of the record, noting that the United States did not enter the case until appeal. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>For our purposes, <i>Locke</i> established a number of significant rules. <i>Locke</i> held that OPA's savings clauses preserved only \"state laws of a scope similar to the matters contained in Title I of OPA,\" <i>id.</i> at 105, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118346\"><a href=\"/opinion/118346/united-states-v-locke/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1135</span></a></span>, and did not constitute a reversal of <i>Ray</i>'s preemption rules as to Title I and Title II of the PWSA, <i>id.</i> at 105-07, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118346\"><a href=\"/opinion/118346/united-states-v-locke/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1135</span></a></span>. Rather, OPA only preserved state authority in the limited area of establishing liability rules and imposing financial requirements regarding oil spills.<sup>[8]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 105, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118346\"><a href=\"/opinion/118346/united-states-v-locke/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1135</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p><i>Locke</i> also rejected the use of general presumptions, either for or against preemption, and instead called for close analysis of the federal statutory structure. <i>Locke</i> expressly repudiated any notion, which might have survived <i>Ray,</i> that there is any presumption of non-preemption of state rules. <i>Id.</i> at 107-08, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118346\"><a href=\"/opinion/118346/united-states-v-locke/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1135</span></a></span>. <i>Locke</i> pointed out that the federal interest in national and international maritime commerce was one of the reasons cited in the Federalist Papers for adopting the Constitution, and the Court detailed the numerous federal statutes and treaties in the area. <i>Id.</i> at 99-103, 108, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118346\"><a href=\"/opinion/118346/united-states-v-locke/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1135</span></a></span>. At the same time, however, <i>Locke</i> did not put in place the opposite presumption, a presumption favoring preemption. Rather, the validity of state regulation must be judged against the \"federal statutory structure.\" <i>Id.</i> at 108, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118346\"><a href=\"/opinion/118346/united-states-v-locke/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1135</span></a></span>. Indeed, \"[n]o artificial presumption aids us in determining the scope of appropriate local regulation under the PWSA.\" <i>Id.; see also</i> P. Gudridge, Comment, United States v. Locke, <i><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118346\"><a href=\"/opinion/118346/united-states-v-locke/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1135</span></a></span>,</i> Am. J. Int'l L. 745, 748 (2000).</p>\n<p><i>Locke</i> reinforced <i>Ray</i>'s two-category approach to preemption: either field preemption or conflict preemption is to be used. <i>Locke,</i> 529 U.S. at 109-11, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118346\"><a href=\"/opinion/118346/united-states-v-locke/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1135</span></a></span>. <i>Locke</i> also went further, recognizing that it would not always be clear which <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> of the two models would apply. It added a new overlap analysis to resolve that question. <i>See id.</i> at 112, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118346\"><a href=\"/opinion/118346/united-states-v-locke/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1135</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>Field preemption applies to state law on subjects which are within the province of Title II of the PWSA. <i>Id.</i> at 110-11, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118346\"><a href=\"/opinion/118346/united-states-v-locke/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1135</span></a></span>. Other sources of federal maritime regulation may also preempt state law, even if the state law is consistent with federal law. <i>Id.</i> at 114-16, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118346\"><a href=\"/opinion/118346/united-states-v-locke/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1135</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>By contrast, <i>Locke</i> held that conflict preemption applies to state regulations within the scope of Title I. Title I of the PWSA does not expressly preserve state power (unlike OPA). But Title I also does not preempt with the same force as Title II. Rather, state law in areas within the province of Title I are subject to standard conflict preemption analysis, primarily the model which the Court has utilized in Commerce Clause cases. <i>Id.</i> at 109-10, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118346\"><a href=\"/opinion/118346/united-states-v-locke/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We describe that overlap analysis below.</p>\n<p>B. <i>Title I, Title II, and Overlap Analysis</i></p>\n<p>The respective scopes of Title I and Title II play a crucial role in any preemption analysis under the PWSA. This necessitates a more detailed discussion of these provisions.</p>\n<p>Congress has, by statute, occupied the field with respect to subject matters addressed in Title II of the PWSA.<sup>[10]</sup> The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> subject matter of Title II, \"Vessels Carrying Certain Cargoes in Bulk,\" is generally defined at 46 U.S.C. § 3703(a):</p>\n<blockquote>The Secretary shall prescribe regulations for the design, construction, alteration, repair, maintenance, operation, equipping, personnel qualification, and manning of vessels to which this chapter applies, that may be necessary for increased protection against hazards to life and property, for navigation and vessel safety, and for enhanced protection of the marine environment.</blockquote>\n<p>Congress has required the Coast Guard to issue regulations under Title II, which \"shall include requirements about . . . (3) equipment and appliances for . . . prevention and mitigation of damage to the marine environment; [and] (4) the manning of vessels and the duties, qualifications, and training of the officers and crew.\" 46 U.S.C. § 3703(a).</p>\n<p>By contrast, conflict preemption is applied to state statutes and regulations concerning subject matters within Title I of the PWSA. <i>See </i><i>Locke,</i> 529 U.S. at 109, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118346\"><a href=\"/opinion/118346/united-states-v-locke/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1135</span></a></span>. The subject matter of Title I is defined by statute:</p>\n<blockquote>Subject to the requirements of section 1224 of this title, the Secretary</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(1) in any port or place under the jurisdiction of the United States, in the navigable waters of the United States, or in any area covered by an international agreement negotiated pursuant to section 1230 of this title, may construct, operate, maintain, improve, or expand vessel traffic services, consisting of measures for controlling or supervising vessel traffic or for protecting navigation and the marine environment and may include, but need not be limited to one or more of the following: reporting and operating requirements, surveillance and communications systems, routing systems, and fairways. . . .</blockquote>\n<p>33 U.S.C. § 1223(a). As the United States has stated, the subject matter of Title I is characterized generally by matters of local concern, and, absent issuance of federal regulations or a decision not to allow state regulation under Title I, state regulation is not preempted in areas subject to that title.</p>\n<p>Title I and Title II overlap in some instances. For example, both titles cover, in different contexts, \"operating\" requirements. <i>See id.</i> § 1223(a)(1) (Secretary may impose measures including, inter alia, \"operating requirements\"); <i>id.</i> § 1223(a)(4)(D) (Secretary may \"restrict[] operation, in any hazardous area or under hazardous conditions, to vessels which have particular operating characteristics or capabilities which he considers necessary for safe operation under the circumstances\"); 46 U.S.C. § 3703(a) (requiring Secretary to \"prescribe regulations for the . . . operation . . . and manning of vessels to which this chapter applies\"); <i>see also </i><i>Locke,</i> 529 U.S. at 116, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118346\"><a href=\"/opinion/118346/united-states-v-locke/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1135</span></a></span> (remanding for consideration of whether a state navigation-watch requirement should be analyzed under Title I conflict preemption or Title II field preemption). Further, each title purports to have as one of its purposes the protection of the environment. <i>See</i> 33 U.S.C. § 1223(a)(1) (authorizing regulations on covered subjects \"for protecting navigation and the marine environment\"); 46 U.S.C. § 3703(a) (requiring regulations on covered subjects \"that may be necessary . . . for enhanced protection of the marine environment\").</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> As a result, <i>Locke</i> recognized that \"[t]he existence of some overlapping coverage between the two titles of the PWSA may make it difficult to determine whether a pre-emption question is controlled by conflict pre-emption principles, applicable generally to Title I, or by field pre-emption rules, applicable generally to Title II.\" 529 U.S. at 111, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118346\"><a href=\"/opinion/118346/united-states-v-locke/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

VESSEL MANNING REQUIREMENTS FOR BUZZARDS BAY</h2>\n<p>The district court held that the two vessel manning requirements of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21M, § 4for tank barges and for tow vessels in Buzzards Bayare field preempted because they are unambiguously covered by Title II, and not Title I. The district court did not engage in the overlap analysis described in <i>Locke. See </i><i>Massachusetts,</i> 440 F.Supp.2d at 35-37. The United States did not seriously present argument to the district court that if Title I applied, federal regulations preempted the vessel manning requirements.</p>\n<p>Subject to certain exceptions,<sup>[14]</sup> the state's manning provision for \"tank barges\" requires that crews consist of \"2 personnel, 1 of whom shall be a certified tanker-man under [federal regulations] who shall be on the tank barge at all times.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21M, § 4(b). The manning provision for \"tow vessels\" towing 6000 or more barrels of oil requires (a) \"at least 1 licensed deck officer or tow vessel operator, who shall serve exclusively as a lookout with no other concurrent duties,\" and (b) \"three licensed officers or tow vessel operators.\" <i>Id.</i> § 4(a).</p>\n<p>The parties raise different preemption arguments for section 4(b), the tank barge provision, and for section 4(a), the tow vessel provision.</p>\n<p>A. <i>The Section 4(b) Tank Barge Manning Requirement in Buzzards Bay</i></p>\n<p>Massachusetts argues that although section (4)(b)'s tank barge manning requirement could be encompassed by Title II, there is nonetheless overlap with Title I. Because of this overlap, the state contends that more facts needed to be developed, and so the issue should not have been resolved at the pleadings stage.</p>\n<p>The United States disagrees, arguing that because \"the manning of vessels\" is listed in Title II,<sup>[15]</sup><i>see</i> 46 U.S.C. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> § 3703(a)(4), all state manning regulations are field preempted by Title II and no overlap analysis is necessary. That contention overreaches. The position of the United States, which the district court accepted, is inconsistent with <i>Locke</i>'s recognition that Title I and Title II can overlap. <i>See</i> 529 U.S. at 111, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118346\"><a href=\"/opinion/118346/united-states-v-locke/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1135</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>While the district court was correct to <i>begin</i> with the text of the Title II, this should not have ended the inquiry. Title II of the PWSA addresses the \"manning of vessels to which this chapter applies,\" 46 U.S.C. § 3703(a), and the chapter applies to \"tank vessels,\" <i>see id.</i> § 3702(a). A tank vessel is in turn defined as</p>\n<blockquote>a vessel that is constructed or adapted to carry, or that carries, oil or hazardous material in bulk as cargo or cargo residue, and that(A) is a vessel of the United States; (B) operates on the navigable waters of the United States; or (C) transfers oil or hazardous material in a port or place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> § 2101(39). Congress required the Coast Guard to promulgate regulations addressing \"the manning of [tank] vessels and the duties, qualifications, and training of the officers and crew.\" <i>Id.</i> § 3703(a)(4).</p>\n<p>Courts must also examine the text of Title I when analyzing the preemptive effect of the PWSA on particular state regulations. <i>See </i><i>Locke,</i> 529 U.S. at 111-12, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118346\"><a href=\"/opinion/118346/united-states-v-locke/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1135</span></a></span>. As the state points out, Title I gives the Secretary authority to promulgate regulations for protecting the marine environment, which may include \"operating requirements.\" 33 U.S.C. § 1223(a)(1). Further, for areas the Secretary considers to be hazardous, the Secretary may establish \"vessel operating conditions\" and/or may restrict operations to \"vessels which have particular operating characteristics or capabilities which he considers necessary for safe operation.\" <i>Id.</i> § 1223(a)(4)(C), (D). The state argues that its manning requirements are thus a type of operational requirement under Title I, for certain vessels in Buzzards Bay, and not a general manning requirement under Title II.</p>\n<p>The United States responds that the phrase \"operating requirements\" is a term of art that refers only to navigational operations in a traffic safety system of the type expressly addressed in Title I of the PWSA. The general operation and manning of vessels, the United States says, are dealt with in Title II and are thus field preempted. <i>See</i> 46 U.S.C. § 3703(a).</p>\n<p>As the state notes, however, Title I's Statement of Policy also refers to \"manning\": \"The Congress finds and declares . . . that increased supervision of <i>vessel</i> . . . <i>operations</i> is necessary in order to . . . insure that vessels operating in the navigable waters of the United States shall comply with all applicable standards and requirements for vessel construction, equipment, <i>manning,</i> and operational procedures.\" 33 U.S.C. § 1221(c)(3) (emphases added). Analysis of the texts of Title I and Title II does not fully resolve the source of the potential preemption here. Nor does initial consideration of the purposes behind Title I and Title II resolve the matter. Both Titles are concerned with enhanced protection of the marine environment. <i>See </i><i>Locke,</i> 529 U.S. at 110-11, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118346\"><a href=\"/opinion/118346/united-states-v-locke/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1135</span></a></span>. As a result, that cannot itself be the distinguishing factor. Nor is it helpful to talk abstractly about the safety of vessels, which, depending on the particular regulations at issue, may be a Title I or a Title II concern.</p>\n<p>The analysis becomes clearer when one considers <i>Locke</i>'s approach. The Court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> invalidated training requirements which applied statewide, controlled manning outside of state waters, and did not address \"matters unique to the waters of Puget Sound.\" <i>Id.</i> at 113, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118346\"><a href=\"/opinion/118346/united-states-v-locke/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1135</span></a></span>. The Court also invalidated an English language proficiency requirement for tanker crews that affected staffing decisions outside of state waters and was \"not limited to governing local traffic or local peculiarities.\" <i>Id.</i> at 113-14, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118346\"><a href=\"/opinion/118346/united-states-v-locke/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1135</span></a></span>. Further, the Court invalidated as field preempted a statewide navigation-watch requirement. The Court noted that this was a general operation and manning requirement under Title II because \"[t]he general watch requirement is not tied to the peculiarities of Puget Sound; it applies throughout Washington's waters and at all times.\" <i>Id.</i> at 114, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118346\"><a href=\"/opinion/118346/united-states-v-locke/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1135</span></a></span>. <i>Locke</i> thus held that the state's general watch regulationrequiring at least four specified personnel in state waters at all timeswas preempted by Title II as an attempt to regulate a tanker's \"operation\" and \"manning\" under 46 U.S.C. § 3703(a). <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>However, at the same time, the Court remanded for performance of an overlap analysis to determine whether a narrower navigation-watch requirement, for times of restricted visibility, should be analyzed under Title I. In line with the Court's articulation of the method for differentiating between Title I and Title II concerns, the Court suggested that, on remand, consideration should be given to Washington's arguments that the narrower requirement was \"of limited extraterritorial effect and necessary to address the peculiarities of Puget Sound.\" <i>Id.</i> at 116, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118346\"><a href=\"/opinion/118346/united-states-v-locke/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1135</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>Relying on this aspect of <i>Locke,</i> the state suggests that any time a state regulation on a given topic is restricted to a particular local waterway, overlap analysis is required. This argument stretches too far and is inconsistent with the balance of <i>Locke</i> as well as <i>Ray.</i> Some topics are Title II topics, regardless of limited geographic application, as the state has essentially conceded in not attempting to defend other sections of its statute. With regard to the manning requirement before us, however, the district court must undertake an overlap inquiry, including a full consideration of the various <i>Locke</i> factors. Further development of the record is in order to resolve this point.</p>\n<p>The United States suggests to us that even if Title I conflict preemption analysis were used, various federal requirements in the area of manning, including regulations promulgated under Title I, suffice to preempt. <i>See, e.g.,</i> 33 C.F.R. § 164.13(c). The argument has not been sufficiently made either before the district court or on appeal, and can be made on remand.</p>\n<p>B. <i>The Section 4(a) Tow Vessel Manning Requirement in Buzzards Bay</i></p>\n<p>We have concluded that the state's tank barge manning requirements for Buzzards Bay must be reconsidered under overlap analysis. For similar reasons, we also conclude that a remand is necessary on the state's tow vessel manning provisions.</p>\n<p>The state nonetheless asks us to go farther. It points out that the text of Title II addresses \"tank vessels,\" not \"tow vessels,\" <i>see</i> 46 U.S.C. § 3702(a), and it contends that the two are not the same.<sup>[16]</sup> Accordingly, the state argues that section 4(a) cannot be within the scope of Title II, and the provision's validity must instead be considered under Title I conflict preemption analysis.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> The United States disagrees with this interpretation of the PWSA. It argues that although the PWSA expressly addresses \"tank vessels,\" and not \"tow vessels,\" that fact is immaterial. The definition of \"tank vessel\" includes any vessel that \"carries . . . oil or hazardous material in bulk as cargo,\" and not just vessels that are \"constructed or adapted to carry . . . oil or hazardous material in bulk as cargo.\" <i>Id.</i> § 2101(39). That definition, in the United States' view, can encompass a tug vessel when it pushes, pulls, or hauls a vessel containing oil or hazardous material (although the vessel would not be within the scope of the definition when it carries some other type of cargo). This interpretation is based on an argument that when a vessel carrying oil or other hazardous material is not self-propelled and requires a tug (as would be the case with a barge), the tug and the non-self-propelled vessel effectively become one vessel which \"carries\" the cargo.</p>\n<p>The state responds that a 2004 amendment added \"towing vessels\" to the list of vessels covered by a separate chapter of Title 46 of the United States Code, but did not similarly add \"towing vessels\" to the list of vessels covered by Title II of the PWSA. <i>See</i> Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2004, Pub.L. No. 108-293, § 415, 118 Stat. 1028, 1047 (codified at 46 U.S.C. § 3301(15)). The amended section already applied to \"tank vessels.\" 46 U.S.C. § 3301(10). The state argues that this means the term \"tank vessel\" does not encompass towing vessels.</p>\n<p>The district court held that although Title II does not expressly use the term \"tow vessels,\" this was a legally insignificant distinction. <i>Massachusetts,</i> 440 F.Supp.2d at 36-37. The district court adopted the United States' argument that \"towing vessels that are pushing, pulling, or hauling tank barges carrying oil or other hazardous materials are, as part of the tow-barge combination, `tank vessels' and are, thus, within the scope of Title II.\" <i>Id.</i> at 37.</p>\n<p>The court explained that adoption of the state's proposed distinction between tank vessels and tow vessels would undermine important federal interests:</p>\n<blockquote>The towing vessel, although it does not physically carry the oil, is the crucial element of the tow-barge combination and, therefore, poses the most risk to the marine environment. Defendants' argument, furthermore, would give the Coast Guard exclusive jurisdiction to regulate one form of tank vessel, self-propelled tankers, but would grant concurrent jurisdiction with the states to regulate the driving force of the tow-tank barge combination. That result would make little practical sense and would hinder the Congressional goal of creating uniform national regulations for all tank vessels.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> This led the court to hold that the matter was clearly within Title II, and so section 4(a) was field preempted. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Our resolution of this appeal does not require us to determine if the state or the federal government has correctly interpreted the meaning of `tank vessel.' Even if the federal government's interpretation is correct, our discussion in Part III.A shows why overlap analysis would still be required before a court could find preemption as a matter of law. That is sufficient for us to reverse the district court's decision to grant judgment on the pleadings, and to remand this issue.<sup>[17]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> IV. TUG ESCORT REQUIREMENTS</h2>\n<p>The United States argues that the state's tug escort provisions, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21M, § 6, are in conflict with regulations promulgated under Title I, <i>see</i> 33 C.F.R. § 165.100(d)(1). The asserted conflict is that the Coast Guard has made a preemptive choice in these regulations that tug escort requirements be set by the Coast Guard on a regional basis, covering all of the First Coast Guard District.<sup>[18]</sup></p>\n<p>The state tug escort statute has three key provisions. It applies only to \"area[s] of special interest within the waters of the commonwealth,\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21M, § 6(a), which include Buzzards Bay, Vineyard Sound, and Mount Hope Bay,<sup>[19]</sup><i>id.</i> § 1. Further, the statute prohibits a tank vessel carrying 6000 or more barrels of oil from entering or transiting such waters unless the tank vessel is accompanied by a tugboat escort. <i>Id.</i> § 6(a). Finally, the section does not apply to a self-propelled tank vessel. <i>Id.</i> § 6(b).</p>\n<p>The United States makes two preliminary arguments that we quickly reject. First, the United States attempts to redefine what is meant by conflict preemption in the Title I context. It argues that once the Coast Guard promulgates regulations on a subject, that ends the matter; there is essentially no room for any further preemption analysis. For example, the United States argues that \"State regulatory authority does not survive once the Secretary establishes federal regulations under Title I.<sup>[20]</sup> The argument overreaches.<sup>[21]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> As pointed out by the state amici, the position of the United States converts <i>Locke</i>'s Title I conflict preemption analysis into something resembling a field preemption analysis. The United States' argument largely destroys the distinction between the two preemption models set forth in <i>Locke,</i> 529 U.S. at 109-10, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118346\"><a href=\"/opinion/118346/united-states-v-locke/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1135</span></a></span>, as discussed above.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the United States means only that if the Coast Guard Title I regulations had expressly preempted the state statute, courts would view the matter under a different model. An agency's preemption judgment is \"dispositive on the question of implicit intent to pre-empt unless either the agency's position is inconsistent with clearly expressed congressional intent, or subsequent developments reveal a change in that position.\" <i>Hillsborough County v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">664</span></a></span> (1982). As we explain, the district court should engage in this review on remand.</p>\n<p>The United States secondly suggests that Massachusetts' tug escort provisions are statutorily preempted by the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1998 (CGAA), Pub.L. No. 105-383, 112 Stat. 3411, under which Congress, apparently frustrated that the Coast Guard had not acted under Title I as to waters in the Northeast, ordered the Coast Guard to do so. Section 311(b)(1)(A) of the CGAA provides that \"[n]ot later than December 31, 1998, the [Coast Guard] <i>shall</i> promulgate regulations for towing vessel and barge safety for the waters of the Northeast.\" <i>Id.</i> at 3423 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>The statutory phrase is not an expression of intent by Congress that any such Coast Guard regulationsregardless of scope, subject matter, or expression of intent to preemptwould occupy the field. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> It is a command to the Coast Guard to promulgate certain types of regulations, which it already had authority to do under Title I.</p>\n<p>The pertinent federal regulations cover the whole of the First Coast Guard District, including Massachusetts. 33 C.F.R. § 165.100(d)(1)(i), (ii) (effective January 29, 1999); 63 Fed.Reg. 71,764, 71,771 (Dec. 30, 1998). The regulations require that single-hull tank barges, unless being towed by a twin-screw propulsion primary towing vessel (with separate power for each screw), must be accompanied by a tugboat escort.<sup>[22]</sup> 33 C.F.R. § 165.100(d)(1)(i). The federal regulations specifically exclude double-hull tank barges from the tug escort requirement. <i>Id.</i> § 165.100(d)(1)(ii).</p>\n<p>The United States argues that Massachusetts' tug escort provisions for sensitive waters are preempted because they are inconsistent with the Coast Guard's regulatory choice that the topic of tug escorts in Northeast waters be regulated on a regional basis. A federal agency's choice in favor of national or regional regulation is a ground for conflict preemption. <i>See </i><i>Locke,</i> 529 U.S. at 109-10, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118346\"><a href=\"/opinion/118346/united-states-v-locke/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1135</span></a></span>. Significantly, the United States has <i>not</i> argued on appeal that it would literally be impossible for ships to comply with both the state statute and federal regulations concerning tug escorts.<sup>[23]</sup></p>\n<p>The state responds on two fronts. The first argument is that there is no conflict preemption here because the Coast Guard regulations do not impose a \"local navigation rule,\" as does Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21M, § 6. The state asserts that its law is valid if the Coast Guard has not adopted a rule regarding the <i>particular waters</i> addressed by the challenged state law. In essence, the state reads <i>Ray</i> to say that Title I conflict preemption requires an exact coincidence between the subject matters of the federal and state regulations. <i>Ray</i> says no such thing. Although <i>Ray</i> did express an interest in whether the Secretary had \"promulgated his own tug requirement for <i>Puget Sound,</i>\" 435 U.S. at 171, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109811\"><a href=\"/opinion/109811/ray-v-atlantic-richfield-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">988</span></a></span> (emphasis added), the Court did not hold that an exact coincidence in subject matter was required to find conflict preemption, <i>id.</i> at 171-72, 174-75, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109811\"><a href=\"/opinion/109811/ray-v-atlantic-richfield-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">988</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>Indeed, there was no federal regulation in <i>Ray</i> purporting to regulate the use of tug escorts specifically in Puget Sound, nor was there a federal regulation covering a broader area which included Puget Sound.<sup>[24]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 171-72, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109811\"><a href=\"/opinion/109811/ray-v-atlantic-richfield-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">988</span></a></span>. Here, the federal regulations contain within their breadth the narrower group of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> waters which are the subject of state regulation. Crucially, the state's argument contains an assumption that federal regulation on a regional basis is disfavored, and that there is a presumption in favor of state regulation of local waters. Not so, as <i>Locke</i> makes clear. 529 U.S. at 108, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118346\"><a href=\"/opinion/118346/united-states-v-locke/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1135</span></a></span>. As it is framed, the state's argument is untenable.</p>\n<p>More generally, the state argues that the Coast Guard has not determined that 33 C.F.R. § 165.100(d)(1) preempts the state tug escort rule at issue. The initial question is whether the Coast Guard has expressed an intent to preempt Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21M, § 6. The United States argues that it is obvious from the regulation and the Coast Guard's accompanying statements that such an intent has been expressed.</p>\n<p>The law of preemption by agency regulation, as the state amici point out, requires a clear statement from the federal agency of its intention to preempt the state regulation at issue. The Supreme Court has held that \"it is appropriate to expect an administrative regulation to declare any intention to pre-empt state law with some specificity.\" <i>Cal. Coastal Comm'n v.

Like other federal agencies, the Coast Guard must, \"[t]o the extent practicable and permitted by law,\" publish a federalism summary impact statement discussing \"any regulation that has federalism implications and that preempts State law,\" after consultation with state and local officials. Exec. Order No. 13,132, § 6(c), 64 Fed.Reg. 43,255, 43,258 (Aug. 4, 1999). We apply this specificity requirement.</p>\n<p>The relevant administrative record on this issue does not consist merely of the First Coast Guard District regulations, 33 C.F.R. § 165.100, and the attendant 1998 Federal Register statement, 63 Fed.Reg. 71,764. It also consists of two later Federal Register statements, issued in 2004 and 2006, which are more pertinently about a proposed tug escort rule for Buzzards Bay. The 1998 Federal Register statement<sup>[25]</sup> could not have addressed MOSPA because MOSPA was not enacted until 2004. But the Coast Guard was well aware of MOSPA when it issued its two later statements.</p>\n<p>In October 2004, the Coast Guard gave advance notice of proposed rulemaking that would require tug escorts for tank barges transiting Buzzards Bay. <i>See</i> 69 Fed.Reg. at 62,427. The advance notice <span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> solicited comments on, inter alia, seven questions. <i>Id.</i> at 62,429. As to federalism concerns, the 2004 notice took the position that several undefined provisions of MOSPA were preempted by the rulings in <i>Locke</i> and <i>Ray,</i> and specifically that section 17 of MOSPA (codified at Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 103, § 28), concerning pilotage requirements for certain vessels engaged in the coastwise trade, was preempted by operation of law. <i>Id.</i> at 62,429-30; <i>see also</i> 2004 Mass. Acts at 933. It is noteworthy that although the Coast Guard in its 2004 notice was clearly aware of the enactment of MOSPA, its federalism statement did not comment on the preemption of the tug escort provision, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21M, § 6. <i>See</i> 69 Fed.Reg. at 62,429-30. If the only pertinent statements were those in 1998 and 2004, we would conclude that the Coast Guard had not clearly expressed an intent to preempt the state tug escort provisions.</p>\n<p>What throws the matter in doubt is the most recent federalism statement from the Coast Guard. The parties and the district court did not focus on the 2006 statement. In March 2006, the Coast Guard issued a notice of proposed rulemaking for Buzzards Bay, 71 Fed.Reg. 15,649.<sup>[26]</sup> That notice, like the 2004 notice, states that section 17 of MOSPA is void by operation of law. <i>Id.</i> at 15,653. The 2006 notice also suggests that parts of section 11 of MOSPA which is codified at Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21M, §§ 1-8, and so covers the relevant provisionare preempted. The 2006 notice specifically mentions the tug escort requirements for vessels in Buzzards Bay (codified at Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21M, § 6), and suggests, for the first time, that these requirements are preempted. It does so not by expressing a direct intent to preempt, but by stating a conclusion that <i>Locke</i> and <i>Ray</i> operate to preempt Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21M, § 6. 71 Fed.Reg. at 15,653. Further, the language suggesting that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21M, § 6 is preempted is not as explicit as that used to signal the preemption of section 17 of MOSPA. <i>See</i> 71 Fed.Reg. at 15,653.</p>\n<p>Under these circumstances, the better course is to remand. The parties should have the opportunity to address, among any other issues, the questions of whether the Coast Guard sufficiently expressed a clear intent to preempt the state tug escort provisions in 2006, and whether, if so, the Coast Guard's position is clearly inconsistent with congressional intent. <i>See </i><i>Cal.

THE STATE'S FINANCIAL ASSURANCE REQUIREMENT</h2>\n<p>The parties again disagree on the proper frame of analysis of the state's financial assurance statute and its exception. Nonetheless, the parties do agree that the analysis here is different from that of the other regulations at issue because Congress (through its enactment of OPA) has expressly saved the states' power to establish liability rules and related requirements. <i>See</i> 33 U.S.C. § 2718. Indeed, the Supreme Court has clarified that OPA did not preempt state power to \"establish liability rules and financial requirements relating to oil spills.\" <i>Locke,</i> 529 U.S. at 105, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118346\"><a href=\"/opinion/118346/united-states-v-locke/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1135</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>MOSPA's financial assurance requirement has two relevant parts, one of which is under attack, and the other of which is conceded not to be preempted (assuming it is severable). In pertinent part, the state statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote>(a) Any vessel, whether or not self-propelled, in or entering upon the waters of the commonwealth for the purpose of transporting, discharging or receiving a cargo of oil, hazardous material, or hazardous waste, shall be subject to the financial assurance requirements and penalty authority as provided in subsections (b) to (d), inclusive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(b) A certificate of financial assurance obtained individually or jointly by the vessel, its owner or agent, its charterer, or by the owner or operator of the terminal at which the vessel discharges or receives its cargo, shall be provided to the department in the amount of at least $1,000,000,000. Vessels with a capacity of less than 6,000 barrels shall present a certificate of financial assurance to the department of environmental protection in the amount of $5,000,000. A copy of the financial assurance shall be posted on the vessel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(c). . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(d) The department may allow financial assurance in a lower amount based upon criteria that includes, but is not limited to, the type and amount of the above cargo transported by the vessel; the size and construction of the vessel, including whether the vessel is double hulled; the safety record of the vessel or the vessel owner, the loss or accident history of the vessel or vessel owner involving maritime spills and the safety equipment used by the vessel. The financial assurance shall be in a form approved by the department.</blockquote>\n<p>Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21, § 50C.</p>\n<p>The United States concedes that, standing alone, the provisions for the $1 billion and $5 million financial assurance certificates (subsections (a) and (b)) are within the state's power under OPA's savings clauses, 33 U.S.C. § 2718(a)(1), (c).<sup>[27]</sup> The dispute is over section 50C(d), which provides that the state Department of Environmental Protection may lower the amount of the bond according to certain criteria, some of which are defined by statute. The specified criteria include: \"the type and amount of cargo transported . . .; the size and construction of the vessel, including whether the vessel is double hulled; the safety record of the vessel or the vessel owner\"; and the vessel's safety equipment. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21, § 50C(d). The department is also given discretion to use other criteria. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> There are two relevant OPA savings clauses. The first, 33 U.S.C. § 2718(a)(1)(A), provides:</p>\n<blockquote>Nothing in this Act . . . shall </blockquote>\n<blockquote>(1) affect, or be construed or interpreted as preempting, the authority of any State or political subdivision thereof from imposing any additional liability or requirements with respect to </blockquote>\n<blockquote>(A) the discharge of oil or other pollution by oil within such State. . . .</blockquote>\n<p>The second clause, 33 U.S.C. § 2718(c)(1), provides:</p>\n<blockquote>Nothing in this Act . . . shall in any way affect, or be construed to affect, the authority of the United States or any State or political subdivision thereof </blockquote>\n<blockquote>(1) to impose additional liability or additional requirements [relating to the discharge, or substantial threat of a discharge, of oil]. . . .</blockquote>\n<p>These clauses in OPA do not define \"requirements.\" The clauses save state laws from preemption by OPA's Title I, but not from OPA's other titles, or from other federal statutes. <i>Locke,</i> 529 U.S. at 106, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118346\"><a href=\"/opinion/118346/united-states-v-locke/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1135</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>The United States asserts that MOSPA is problematic because the exceptions in section 50C(d) encompass criteria at the core of PWSA's Title II.<sup>[28]</sup> Moreover, the state statute merely provides that the criteria are to be administered by the state agency, and it offers no further guidance.</p>\n<p>The United States asserts that the state may not regulate indirectly what it cannot regulate directly under Title II. The state and the Coalition acknowledge that an indirect regulation argument <i>might</i> survive <i>Ray. Ray</i> did consider such an indirect regulation theory, although there the theory did not concern a state financial, assurance certification under OPA's savings clauses. <i>See</i> 435 U.S. at 173 &amp; n. 25, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109811\"><a href=\"/opinion/109811/ray-v-atlantic-richfield-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">988</span></a></span> (inquiring whether a state's tug escort rule indirectly regulated primary conduct, and rejecting that possibility on the facts presented). Nonetheless, even assuming arguendo that some theory of impermissible indirect regulation is viable even in a savings clause case, the United States has not to date met its burden on its argument that the statute is not within the powers reserved to the states.</p>\n<p>In this case, the two sides take fundamentally different views of what constitutes impermissible indirect regulation. There is a lack of clarity regarding the exact nature of both the United States' claim and the state's defense. The issue can be viewed as a spectrum problem. On the one hand, there is the state's statutory choice to establish a financial assurance program, the cost of which may be reduced by criteria which are attuned to degree of risk. Such gradations are common to most insurance schemes. On the other hand, there is a federal fear that implementation of this scheme will lead to state regulation of primary conduct  conduct <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> that is exclusively under federal control pursuant to Title II.<sup>[29]</sup></p>\n<p>In the United States' view, MOSPA's impermissible indirect effect is inherent in the structure of its financial assurance provision. Because here, according to the United States, \"the potential to influence primary conduct cannot be eliminated or even discounted,\" the statute is preempted as a matter of law. Under this theory, there is no need to present facts demonstrating that the provision would impose an actual burden or impediment to federal Title II authority.</p>\n<p>One might ask why, if the state may impose a $1 billion financial assurance requirement, a state may not also reduce the amount based on the objective criteria set forth in the statute  criteria which appear, on their face, to be rationally related to the degree of the risk posed. After all, there would appear to be less risk of spillage from a double-hulled vessel. Similarly, a vessel's capacity would presumably be related to the amount of expected liability if a spill did occur. Tellingly, OPA itself has a federal financial assurance requirement; as recently amended by Congress, the statute requires differing amounts of financial assurance based on whether or not a vessel is single-hulled, based on whether or not the vessel is a \"tank vessel,\" and based on the gross tonnage<sup>[30]</sup> of the vessel. 33 U.S.C. §§ 2704, 2716.</p>\n<p>The United States responds that MOSPA's $1 billion requirement is effectively no more than a ceiling, and that in practice the amounts charged will vary depending on criteria that are exclusively under federal control under PWSA's Title II. The United States argues that a state may never use criteria within Title II to ground its decisions.<sup>[31]</sup> That is because the state's mechanism amounts to a financial incentive \"for any design, cargo or equipment changes that [state regulators] think appropriate.\" We are doubtful that when Congress authorized the states to set financial assurance requirements it at the same time meant <i>per se</i> to preempt states from using graduated levels rationally related to risk. It is again worth observing that OPA itself imposes federal financial assurance requirements that are not uniform for all vessels. Under the OPA regime, vessels over 300 gross tons with oil on board, and certain other vessels of any size, are required to provide evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to meet OPA's liability maximums. 33 U.S.C. § 2716; <i>see also id.</i> § 2704 (setting forth liability maximums). At the time OPA was enacted, these maximums differed based on the vessel's gross tonnage, and based on whether or not the vessel was a tank vessel.<sup>[32]</sup> Pub.L. No. 101-380, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> § 1004(a), 104 Stat. at 491-92. In light of this, it is difficult to believe that Congress intended to preclude the states from similarly calibrating their financial assurance requirements to account for different vessel characteristics.</p>\n<p>Moreover, we should not be quick to assume that Congress intended preemption here. One commentator has read <i>Ray</i> to mean that when a state provides for alternative courses of behavior, one preempted and one not, the overall state scheme is not preempted unless the state's requirements act to exert pressure on operators in preempted areas. <i>See</i> Tribe, <i>supra,</i> § 6-26, at 486-87. <i>Ray</i> considered and rejected such a claim on its facts, and in light of the Court's treatment of the issue, Professor Tribe has concluded that \"the basic teaching of the [<i>Ray</i>] decision is that state pressure to act in derogation of a federal statutory scheme is not to be inferred lightly.\" <i>Id.</i> at 487.</p>\n<p>That principle has even more force in our case. In OPA, Congress expressly preserved state power to require financial assurance. <i>Ray</i>'s discussion of indirect regulation did not involve any such explicit congressional preservation. Moreover, <i>Ray</i> decided the indirect regulation issue on a detailed record replete with factual stipulations. 435 U.S. at 156, 173 &amp; n. 25, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109811\"><a href=\"/opinion/109811/ray-v-atlantic-richfield-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">988</span></a></span>. In this context, we reject the United States' arguments that the existence of pressure to conform conduct can be decided here as a matter of law, and that the actual effects of the state statute are irrelevant.</p>\n<p>As a fallback argument, the United States contends that it <i>has</i> established the existence of burdensome pressure, as MOSPA gives a state agency the authority to calibrate the assurance requirement on a case-by-case basis with only general guidance. It is not clear whether the United States means to argue that the state could constitutionally enact a financial assurance provision which, for example, allowed reductions according to a legislatively set schedule based on various design and other defined criteria.<sup>[33]</sup> Nor is it clear if the United States' position would permit a state to use regulations (rather than a statute) to enact such a provision, if these regulations reduced and cabined administrative discretion.</p>\n<p>The district court took a different approach. It correctly held that the effect of the statute was relevant. It asked whether the practical effect of the $1 billion rule was to force vessels to seek reductions pursuant to the exemption scheme. <i>Massachusetts,</i> 440 F.Supp.2d at 46. The court then decided, without hearing any evidence and on a motion for judgment on the pleadings, \"that the Commonwealth's one billion dollar financial assurance requirement imposes such an onerous financial obligation on a tank vessel owner that it in effect forces compliance with the statutory exception criteria.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>As an initial matter, the $1 billion amount does not appear to be plainly unreasonable <span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> when measured against risk. The remedial costs of the <i>Exxon Valdez</i> spill in 1989 surpassed $2 billion (as measured in 1990 dollars). A. Rodriguez &amp; P. Jaffe, <i>The Oil Pollution Act of 1990,</i> 15 Tul. Mar. L.J. 1, 16 (1990). In Buzzards Bay, while the clean-up costs from the 2003 spill were significantly lower, they were still sizable.<sup>[34]</sup></p>\n<p>Moreover, the record does not yet contain evidence about the requirements other states have set, industry usage and practice, or the costs of obtaining financial assurance. Nor have the parties even discussed or presented evidence about the requirements set by the federal government. While our own research on this last point has uncovered the federal rules, <i>see</i> 33 U.S.C. §§ 2704, 2716, those rules simply highlight the need for further facts. Indeed, the federal requirements set a complicated formula based in part on a vessel's gross tonnage, and there is nothing in the record informing us about the gross tonnages of vessels that traverse Buzzards Bay.</p>\n<p>Of course, even if the $1 billion amount were not in itself unreasonable, it is possible that such an amount would still place strong pressure on the industry to change its primary conduct. Yet there is simply no evidence on this point.</p>\n<p>The district court also found it significant that there was a lack of notice to vessel owners about the specific criteria that the state would use in lowering the bond amount; this was the crux of its concern about the vagueness of the criteria and the untrammeled delegation to the state agency. <i>See </i><i>Massachusetts,</i> 440 F.Supp.2d at 46. Given its finding that the state system necessarily forced vessels into compliance with the exemptions, the court held that the exemption scheme necessarily undercut the certainty that federal regulation under Title II afforded the industry. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The state characterizes the indirect regulation issue differently. It agrees with the district court that the analysis might turn on the practical effect of the $1 billion amount and the implemented exceptions. But it argues that there was no evidence of record to support the district court's conclusion. It also points out that an offer of proof was made to the court of evidence that no real burden is posed by the exemptions to the statute.</p>\n<p>The analysis presented thus far is insufficient to permit resolution of the matter on its merits. As the state has not yet exercised its administrative authority, it is unclear how it would choose to grant exceptions to the financial assurance requirement. We simply cannot yet say that MOSPA's section 50C(d) is incapable of any constitutional application. It may well be that the state will structure its decision making as to the exemption in a way that would frame the preemption question differently. It may even be that discussions between state and federal authorities would produce an agreed-upon scheme that adequately protects both state and federal interests. Given the absence of evidence at this stage, it is too early to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> know whether the state exception scheme would intrude impermissibly on the Coast Guard's exclusive authority under Title II.<sup>[35]</sup> On this record, the district court was not warranted in permanently enjoining any aspects of the financial assurance provision.<sup>[36]</sup></p>\n<p>Nonetheless, we do share the concerns of the United States that the state has yet to make a showing, by regulation or otherwise, explaining how it will utilize its discretion under section 50C(d). Since the state has not structured its exemption scheme, there is no operational scheme to enjoin. The state should make such a showing on remand; we leave it to the district court to consider the appropriateness of a preliminary injunction thereafter.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VI. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The questions here do not turn on whether the state or the federal regulations best protect Buzzards Bay and the sensitive waters of Massachusetts from oil spills, given the costs imposed by regulation. Making such determinations is not the role of a federal court.</p>\n<p>Our question is whether the district court erred in concluding, as a matter of judgment on the pleadings, that the PWSA left no room for the state government to enact these state statutory provisions. The district court erred in entering permanent injunctions, as well as in entering judgment for the United States, at this stage in the proceedings.</p>\n<p>On remand, the parties should address the question of an interim agreement to stay MOSPA's provisions pendente lite. In the absence of an agreement by the parties, we leave it to the district court to determine whether the United States can, under the proper analysis, meet its burden that the state should be preliminarily enjoined from enforcement of the relevant statutory sections.</p>\n<p>No costs are awarded.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Defendants Mitt Romney and Robert W.

When the Coast Guard makes a determination not to impose a regulation, this may amount to a decision that no regulation at either the state or federal level is appropriate. <i>See </i><i>Ark. Elec.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">988</span></a></span>. However, a decision by the Coast Guard not to regulate in a field does not necessarily mean that the Coast Guard intended to preempt state law. <i>See </i><i>Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"122246\"><a href=\"/opinion/122246/sprietsma-v-mercury-marine/\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span>, 65-67, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"122246\"><a href=\"/opinion/122246/sprietsma-v-mercury-marine/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span> (2002).</p>\n<p>[10]  Other sources of federal maritime law may also preempt state regulation by occupying the field. This is true even if the state requirements are very similar to federal requirements. For example, <i>Locke</i> held that Washington's marine casualty reporting requirement was preempted, despite its similarity to federal requirements, because \"Congress intended that the Coast Guard regulations [under 46 U.S.C. § 6101] be the sole source of a vessel's reporting obligations.\" 529 U.S. at 115, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118346\"><a href=\"/opinion/118346/united-states-v-locke/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1135</span></a></span>. The state's reporting requirement created a significant burden in terms of costs, posed a risk of innocent non-compliance, and affected a vessel operator's out-of-state obligations and conductfactors which called into question the state's authority to regulate. <i>Id.</i> at 116, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118346\"><a href=\"/opinion/118346/united-states-v-locke/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1135</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>[11]  These factors are drawn from themes identified in other Supreme Court cases. \"Whether federal [regulation] operates to preempt state regulation will ordinarily depend on the respective aims of the state and federal schemes.\" L. Tribe, <i>American Constitutional Law</i> § 6-28, at 506-07 (2d ed.1988).</p>\n<p>[12]  In <i>Huron,</i> the Court found that the state law at issue was not preempted; in doing so the Court contrasted the purpose of federal inspection laws, which sought \"to insure the seagoing safety of vessels subject to inspection,\" with the purpose of a Detroit ordinance, which sought to eliminate air pollution \"to protect the health and enhance the cleanliness of the local community.\" 362 U.S. at 445-46, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106041\"><a href=\"/opinion/106041/huron-portland-cement-co-v-detroit/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">813</span></a></span>. In <i>Kelly,</i> the Court similarly upheld state legislation concerning motor-driven tugs, and it considered the state law's purpose of insuring safety and determining seaworthiness. 302 U.S. at 8, 14-16, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></span>.\n</p>\n<p>\"[T]he principles developed [under Commerce Clause preemption] are not limited to [that] context; essentially the same techniques are used to determine the consequences for state action of <i>any</i> exercise of a plenary federal authority.\" Tribe, <i>supra,</i> § 6-29, at 508. Nonetheless, there are some distinctions between Commerce Clause preemption rules and maritime preemption rules. <i>See </i><i>Am. Dredging Co. v. Miller,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112930\"><a href=\"/opinion/112930/american-dredging-co-v-miller/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span>, 452 n. 3, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112930\"><a href=\"/opinion/112930/american-dredging-co-v-miller/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Virtually every state regulation of merchant vessel safety can also be characterized as having a \"pollution prevention\" purpose. Thus, federal legislation on the subject of vessel construction, design, equipment, and manning . . ., but having, by the court's characterization, a purpose other than pollution prevention, would not occupy the field of pollution prevention addressed by the challenged state law.</p>\n<p>C. Allen, <i>Federalism in the Era of International Standards: Federal and State Government Regulation of Merchant Vessels in the United States (Part III),</i> 30 J. Mar. L. &amp; Com. 85, 94 (1999).</p>\n<p>[14]  Section 4(b) exempts barges that carry less than 6000 gallons of oil, as well as barges that are not equipped to carry personnel on board. Section 4(c) additionally exempts double-hulled barges from the requirements of section 4(b).</p>\n<p>[15]  The Coast Guard has in fact promulgated regulations requiring tankers to \"navigate with at least two licensed deck officers on watch . . ., one of whom may be a pilot. In waters where a pilot is required, the second officer . . . must be an individual licensed and assigned to the vessel as master, mate, or officer in charge of a navigational watch,\" separate from the pilot. 33 C.F.R. § 164.13(c).</p>\n<p>[16]  A \"towing vessel\" is \"a commercial vessel engaged in or intending to engage in the service of pulling, pushing, or hauling along side, or any combination of pulling, pushing, or hauling along side.\" 46 U.S.C. § 2101(40).</p>\n<p>[17]  We call the parties' attention to 33 C.F.R. § 138.20. Section 138.20 was not promulgated under Title II, but instead under both OPA and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). The regulation's definition of \"tank vessel\" clearly excludes tow vessels:\n</p>\n<p>Tank vessel means a vessel (<i>other than . . . a towing or pushing vessel (tug) simply because it has in its custody a tank barge</i>) that is constructed or adapted to carry, or that carries, oil or liquid hazardous material in bulk as cargo or cargo residue, and that</p>\n<p>(1) Is a vessel of the United States;</p>\n<p>(2) Operates on the navigable waters; or</p>\n<p>(3) Transfers oil or hazardous material in a place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.</p>\n<p>33 C.F.R. § 138.20(b). With the exception of the parenthetical clause, this definition is nearly identical to the Title II definition of \"tank vessel\" found at 46 U.S.C. § 2101(39). We leave the significance, if any, of this textual difference to the preemption analysis to the district court in the first instance.</p>\n<p>[18]  The First Coast Guard District is comprised of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and parts of New York and New Jersey. 33 C.F.R. § 3.05-1(b).</p>\n<p>[19]  The statute also permits the state Secretary of Environmental Affairs to expand the definition to include other waters which meet particular criteria. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21M, § 1. Further, section 6(c) permits the state commissioner to promulgate certain regulations. This case is confined to the facial constitutionality of the cited statutory provisions. No state regulations are at issue here, nor are any bodies of water implicated other than the three specifically listed in the statute.</p>\n<p>[20]  The district court's decision could be read to have adopted the United States' position: \"In this case, the Coast Guard has regulated on the challenged subject. This court, therefore, need not [delve further into the Title I analysis].\" <i>Massachusetts,</i> 440 F.Supp.2d at 42.</p>\n<p>[21]  The United States relies primarily on <i>Ray</i> to argue that when the federal government adopts a regulation covering an area within the scope of Title I, state regulation on the same subject is preempted. It is true that <i>Ray</i> stated that \"[t]he relevant inquiry under Title I with respect to the State's power to impose a tug-escort rule is thus whether the Secretary has either promulgated his own tug requirement for [local] tanker navigation or has decided that no such requirement should be imposed at all.\" 435 U.S. at 171-72, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109811\"><a href=\"/opinion/109811/ray-v-atlantic-richfield-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">988</span></a></span>. On this record, however, neither of those premises is demonstrated.\n</p>\n<p>We also note that Title I has changed since <i>Ray,</i> another issue that should be addressed on remand. At the time of the <i>Ray</i> decision, 33 U.S.C. § 1222(b) had provided: \"Nothing contained in this <i>chapter</i> [referring to Title I of the PWSA] . . . prevent[s] a State or political subdivision thereof from prescribing <i>for structures only</i> higher safety equipment requirements or safety standards than those which may be prescribed pursuant to this chapter.\" 33 U.S.C. § 1222(b) (1976) (emphases added). <i>Ray</i> reasoned that since § 1222(b) permitted states to impose higher safety standards only for \"structures,\" this \"impliedly forb[ade] higher state standards for vessels.\" <i>Ray,</i> 435 U.S. at 174, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109811\"><a href=\"/opinion/109811/ray-v-atlantic-richfield-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">988</span></a></span>. The Court thus held that \"the State may not impose higher safety standards than those prescribed by the Secretary [limiting the size of vessels in Puget Sound].\" <i>Id.</i> at 175, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109811\"><a href=\"/opinion/109811/ray-v-atlantic-richfield-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">988</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>The language pertaining to higher state safety standards no longer appears at § 1222. In 1978, Congress amended Title I, deleting any mention of state safety standards from § 1222, and instead adding a different provision to § 1225. Port and Tanker Safety Act of 1978, § 2, 92 Stat. at 1471-75. Section 1225, entitled \"Waterfront safety,\" now provides: \"Nothing contained in this <i>section,</i> with respect to <i>structures,</i> prohibits a State or political subdivision thereof from prescribing higher safety equipment requirements or safety standards than those which may be prescribed by [federal] regulations. . . .\" 33 U.S.C. § 1225(b) (emphases added). Again, we leave the significance of this change to the district court on remand.</p>\n<p>[22]  The federal regulations delegate some authority to the \"Captain of the Port\" to grant exceptions to the tug escort rule. 33 C.F.R. § 165.100(d)(1)(iii). In a different paragraph, the regulations also impose special enhanced radio communication requirements for some sensitive locations within Massachusetts' waters. <i>Id.</i> § 165.100(d)(2).</p>\n<p>[23]  The district court did find such an impossibility, stating that \"[t]ank barges traveling through Massachusetts waters . . . cannot comply with both the state and federal regulations.\" <i>Massachusetts,</i> 440 F.Supp.2d at 42. The state protests that there is no impossibility because nothing in the federal regulations prohibits taking on a tugboat escort. The United States has neither relied on nor defended the district court's ruling, so we do not consider it.</p>\n<p>[24]  The Court did comment that then-pending rulemaking \"requir[ing] tug escorts for certain vessels operating in <i>confined waters,</i>\" if passed, had the potential to preempt the state's tug escort rule. <i>Ray,</i> 435 U.S. at 172, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109811\"><a href=\"/opinion/109811/ray-v-atlantic-richfield-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">988</span></a></span> (emphasis added); <i>see also</i> 41 Fed.Reg. 18,770, 18,771 (May 6, 1976). Notably, the Court did not suggest that the federal rule would need to specify <i>particular</i> \"confined waters\" in order to preempt the state's tug escort rule.</p>\n<p>[25]  The Coast Guard made several points in its 1998 explanation of the regulations at 33 C.F.R. § 165.100. Specifically noting the environmental sensitivity of waters in the Northeast, including Massachusetts waters, it stated: \"This rule takes a regional approach responsive to the particular risks inherent in the transportation of petroleum products on the waterways in the Northeastern United States.\" 63 Fed.Reg. at 71,765. The Coast Guard noted that several New England states were attempting to regulate tank barges transporting oil, and that \"[t]he states' differing legislative initiatives might result in inconsistent regulation of the industry.\" <i>Id.</i> The Coast Guard also noted comments that the rules for positive control of barges should be <i>national</i> in scope, but it rejected that position in favor of regional regulation. <i>Id.</i> at 71,765-66. The 1998 explanation contains no explicit statement rejecting state regulation of particularized local waters.\n</p>\n<p>Significantly, under the heading of \"Federalism,\" the Coast Guard discussed whether its regulations would preempt certain provisions of Rhode Island law. The Coast Guard concluded, inter alia, that its regulations would preempt Rhode Island law on positive control for barges, found at R.I. Gen. Laws § 46-12.6-8(a)(3) (repealed 2000). 63 Fed.Reg. at 71,770. The Rhode Island law had statewide application and was not limited to specified local waters. 1997 R.I. Pub. Laws 217, 217-18.</p>\n<p>[26]  The proposed amendments for the First Coast Guard District Regulated Navigation Area\n</p>\n<p>would require that all single-hull tank barges carrying 5000 or more barrels of oil or other hazardous material and being towed through Buzzards Bay, meet the following requirements:</p>\n<p>1. Be accompanied by an escort tug between the west entrance to Buzzards Bay and the east end of the Cape Cod Canal.</p>\n<p>2. Be accompanied by a federally licensed pilot, who may remain on the escort tug vessel, to monitor the navigation of the tug/barge, and to advise the master of the tug/barge accordingly.</p>\n<p>71 Fed.Reg. at 15,652. The proposed amendments also sought to establish a \"Vessel Movement Reporting System\" within Buzzards Bay to monitor the movements of certain vessels. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>[27]  OPA's savings clauses refer only to liability requirements related to the discharge of oil. However, MOSPA has a broader scope, as its financial assurance provisions also apply to vessels carrying hazardous materials. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21, § 50C(a). The parties have not discussed this disconnect in their briefs. Since the topic of hazardous materials has not been addressed by the parties' briefs, we do not discuss it further.</p>\n<p>[28]  In support of its argument that section 50C(d) invades the province of Title II, the United States notes that Title II specifically requires the Coast Guard to issue safety regulations that consider \"the types and grades of cargo permitted to be on board a tank vessel.\" 46 U.S.C. § 3703(b). It also requires the Coast Guard to regulate tank vessel design standards, <i>id.</i> § 3703(a), mandates that the Coast Guard promulgate rules regarding \"superstructures\" and \"hulls,\" <i>id.</i> § 3703(a)(1), requires the Coast Guard to prescribe rules regarding the equipping of tank vessels, <i>id.,</i> and instructs the Coast Guard to issue rules concerning \"equipment and appliances for lifesaving, fire protection, and prevention and mitigation of damage to the marine environment,\" <i>id.</i> § 3703(a)(3). The United States also points out that a different federal statute establishes reporting requirements. <i>See id.</i> § 6101 (requiring that the Coast Guard prescribe regulations on marine incident reporting and listing specific kinds of incidents that the regulations must cover).</p>\n<p>[29]  The state amici argue that there is no reason to assume that the state's scheme is a pretext to regulate Title II subjects, or to assume that the state has improper motives. However, the United States' objection is concerned with the potential effects of the scheme on primary conduct under Title II, regardless of motive. In any event, because there is insufficient evidence even of the statute's effects, we need not decide if improper motive is relevant to the preemption inquiry.</p>\n<p>[30]  It appears that \"gross tonnage\" is a measure for a ship's internal capacity. <i>See</i> Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2407 (1993); <i>see also</i> 46 C.F.R. § 69.9 (\"Gross tonnage means a vessel's approximate volume.\").</p>\n<p>[31]  Under the United States' theory, it would make no difference if the state set a minimum amount for a bond and ratcheted it up according to these defined criteria, or if the state instead set a ceiling and ratcheted down.</p>\n<p>[32]  A later amendment introduced even more gradations. This amendment significantly increased the size of the liability maximums, and also adjusted the limits to take into account whether or not a vessel is single hulled. <i>See</i> Delaware River Protection Act of 2006, Pub.L. No. 109-241, § 603, 120 Stat. 516, 553-54 (codified at 33 U.S.C. § 2704). The amendment also required the Coast Guard to report back to Congress, within 45 days of the amendment's enactment, on the adequacy of the federal liability limits. <i>Id.</i>\n</p>\n<p>The Coast Guard has yet to revise its financial assurance regulations to respond to this statutory amendment. While it \"anticipate[s] initiating a rulemaking\" to institute the changes, 71 Fed.Reg. 47,737, 47,738 (Aug. 18, 2006), it has told vessel operators that the prior requirements for submitting evidence of financial responsibility remain in effect until such rulemaking takes place, <i>id.</i></p>\n<p>[33]  The United States concedes that the state legislature \"has substantial latitude to calibrate the bond requirement.\" But the full reach of this concession is not entirely clear.</p>\n<p>[34]  One estimate, offered by the Executive Director of the Buzzards Bay National Estuary Program, put those costs at $36 million, which was on top of the $10 million the vessel owners paid in criminal penalties. <i>See</i> J. Costa, <i>Costs of the</i> Bouchard No. 120 <i>Oil Spill,</i> http://www.buzzardsbay.org/ oilspillcosts.htm (last updated Dec. 21, 2005); <i>see also</i> R. Mishra, <i>Legal Technicality Derails $10M Redress for Oil Spill,</i> Boston Globe, Sept. 15, 2004, at B2 (stating that $38 million had already been spent on clean-up). That spill involved \"only\" 98,000 gallons of oil. A larger spill, such as the 300,000 gallon spill that nearby Narragansett Bay saw in 1989, might be expected to impose far greater costs.</p>\n<p>[35]  Our conclusion, that a permanent injunction was premature, also encompasses the plaintiffs' claim that section 50C(d) is preempted insofar as it allows reductions based on a vessel's safety record. Plaintiffs have asserted that this part of the law is invalid because it interferes with exclusive Coast Guard reporting requirements. <i>See</i> 46 U.S.C. § 6101. The apparent assumption is that when a vessel applies for the exception, the state will necessarily require the vessel owner to describe past safety incidents. But this conclusion is too hasty. For example, the state agency could decide to simply look at the reports required to be filed under federal law.</p>\n<p>[36]  Although there is some ambiguity, and the parties disagree on appeal, we conclude that the district court sub silentio held that the exception clause, section 50C(d), was severable from the rest of the statute. At the end of its opinion, the court stated that \"[t]he Commonwealth is . . . permanently enjoined from conditioning the one billion dollar financial assurance requirement on criteria of tank vessel design, operation, equipping, or reporting requirements.\" <i>Massachusetts,</i> 440 F.Supp.2d at 48. The court further stated that it was not enjoining <i>all</i> possible uses of the discretionary exception  just those in the specifically mentioned areas. <i>Id.</i> at 48 n. 204. The district court's decision left clauses (a) through (c) fully in place.</p>\n\n</div>",
