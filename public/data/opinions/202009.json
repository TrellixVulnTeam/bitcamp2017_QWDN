Canning, with whom Hinckley, Allen & Snyder LLP\nwas on brief, for appellants.\n          Robert J. Branman, Attorney, Tax Division, Department of\nJustice, with whom Eileen J. O'Connor, Assistant Attorney General,\nand Bruce R. Ellisen, Attorney, Tax Division, were on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n                        January 10, 2006\n\f               LYNCH, Circuit Judge.         As framed by the parties, this\n\ncase       raises   a   question   about    whether   the   Uniform   Fraudulent\n\nTransfer Act (UFTA), in its Rhode Island incarnation, R.I. Gen.\n\nLaws §§ 6-16-1 to -12, restricts a court, in setting aside a\n\nfraudulent conveyance, to awarding against the transferee a money\n\njudgment that is limited to the value of the property at the time\n\nof the transfer.\n\n               On May 14, 1992, Rosalina Verduchi and her husband\n\nCoriolano (\"Cal\") transferred their home at 10 Chestnut Street,\n\nNorth Providence, to their son, Dennis, for no consideration.               The\n\nproblem was that they made this \"gift\" while they owed the IRS more\n\nthan $82,000 in taxes and interest, as had been finally adjudicated\n\nin court a year earlier.           See Schwartz v. Comm'r, 930 F.2d 920 (9th\n\nCir. 1991) (unpublished table decision).1\n\n               On March 18, 1993, the IRS issued an assessment against\n\nRosalina and Cal for their tax liability, which by then had\n\nballooned to almost $400,000 because of interest.                A federal tax\n\nlien arose on all of the Verduchis' property upon the date of\n\nassessment, see 26 U.S.C. §§ 6321, 6322, and in January 1994, the\n\nIRS filed its notice of tax lien.\n\n               Rosalina and Cal successfully went through bankruptcy\n\nproceedings in 1996 and discharged their debts.              But the discharge\n\n\n       1\n          The Verduchis and the IRS had agreed to be bound by the\noutcome of Schwartz, which involved a taxpayer who had participated\nin the same tax shelter as the Verduchis had.\n\n                                           -3-\n\fdid not apply to any tax obligation that the debtors sought to\n\navoid by fraudulently conveying property that would have been\n\navailable to satisfy that debt.    See 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(1)(C).   In\n\nApril 2003, the United States brought suit against Rosalina and\n\nDennis pursuant to 26 U.S.C. §§ 7401 and 7403,2 seeking to reduce\n\nRosalina's unpaid tax liabilities to judgment, to set aside the\n\ntransfer of the Chestnut Street property as fraudulent, and to\n\nforeclose the federal tax lien against the property.\n\n             The government learned in discovery that Dennis, on\n\nNovember 5, 2002, had given a mortgage on 10 Chestnut Street to\n\nOption One Mortgage Corporation (\"Option One\") in exchange for\n\n$196,000.     It then filed an amended complaint on March 2, 2004\n\nnaming Option One as a defendant with an interest.    See 26 U.S.C.\n\n§ 7403(b).    Before trial, the government conceded that any federal\n\ntax lien on the Chestnut Street property would be subordinate to\n\nOption One's mortgage.\n\n             In the amended complaint, the government sought, inter\n\nalia: (1) foreclosure of its federal tax liens upon and the sale of\n\n10 Chestnut Street pursuant to 26 U.S.C. § 7403 and 28 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 2001 and 2002, or (2) money judgment against Dennis for the\n\ngreater of three possible values -- the current market value of the\n\nproperty, the date-of-transfer market value, or the $196,000 he\n\nreceived from the mortgage, plus interest.     Initially, these two\n\n\n     2\n             Cal Verduchi died in 1998.\n\n                                  -4-\n\fremedies were sought in the alternative; however, in a pre-trial\n\nmemorandum submitted to the district court on June 9, 2004, the\n\ngovernment stated its intention to seek foreclosure of the lien, as\n\nwell   as   a    money    judgment     against    Dennis    for   $196,000,   plus\n\ninterest, representing the amount of the mortgage he had taken out\n\non the property.\n\n               After a bench trial on November 8, 2004, the district\n\ncourt held that the transfer of the Chestnut Street property to\n\nDennis was fraudulent, set aside the transfer, and ordered that the\n\nfederal tax lien should be foreclosed and the property sold.                   See\n\nUnited States v. Verduchi, No. 03-139-T, 2005 WL 1027017, at *7\n\n(D.R.I. Apr. 25, 2005). The court ordered that judgment be entered\n\nagainst Rosalina for $397,824.16 plus interest accrued since March\n\n18, 1993 (for a total of more than $875,000) and that the proceeds\n\nfrom the sale of the property in excess of Option One's mortgage\n\namount be applied toward Rosalina's unpaid tax liabilities.                    Id.\n\nThe    court    also     entered   a   money     judgment   against   Dennis    as\n\ntransferee in the sum of $196,000 plus post-judgment interest, on\n\nthe basis that the sum received from the sale of the property would\n\n\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fbe diminished by the amount of Option One's mortgage.3   Id.   Dennis\n\nappeals.4\n\n                                 I.\n\n            We offer a brief background on how the federal tax laws\n\noperate in this arena.\n\n            Where the United States seeks to recover a tax debt, it\n\nhas at its disposal a \"formidable arsenal of collection tools.\"\n\nUnited States v. Rodgers, 461 U.S. 677, 683 (1983); see also\n\nMarkham v. Fay, 74 F.3d 1347, 1353-54 (1st Cir. 1996) (cataloging\n\nvarious means by which the government can collect from deficient\n\ntaxpayers).    In a fraudulent transfer case, the government can\n\nelect, among other options, \"to bring an action either to enforce\n\na lien under 26 U.S.C. § 7403 or against the transferee of a\n\ntaxpayer.\"5    United States v. Perrina, 877 F. Supp. 215, 217\n\n\n     3\n          Dennis has never asserted that he has paid off any part\nof the mortgage or that Option One's take would be less than\n$196,000.\n     4\n          While nominally both Rosalina and Dennis are listed as\nappellants, in fact this appeal concerns only Dennis's challenge to\nthe judgment against him for $196,000.\n     5\n            Section 7403 provides, in relevant part:\n\n     (a) Filing.--In any case where there has been a refusal\n     or neglect to pay any tax, or to discharge any liability\n     in respect thereof, whether or not levy has been made,\n     the Attorney General or his delegate, at the request of\n     the Secretary, may direct a civil action to be filed in\n     a district court of the United States to enforce the lien\n     of the United States under this title with respect to\n     such tax or liability or to subject any property, of\n     whatever nature, of the delinquent, or in which he has\n\n                                 -6-\n\f(D.N.J. 1994) (citing Rodgers, 461 U.S. at 682); see also Leighton\n\nv. United States, 289 U.S. 506, 509 (1933) (noting, among other\n\nmethods of recovering an outstanding tax debt, \"the right of the\n\nUnited States to proceed against transferees by suit\").\n\n          \"The threshold question in . . . all cases where the\n\nFederal Government asserts its tax lien[] is whether and to what\n\nextent the taxpayer had 'property' or 'rights to property' to which\n\nthe tax lien could attach.\"   Aquilino v. United States, 363 U.S.\n\n509, 512 (1960).   \"In answering that question, both federal and\n\nstate courts must look to state law . . . .\"    Id. at 512-13; see\n\nalso United States v. Craft, 535 U.S. 274, 278 (2002) (\"[W]e look\n\ninitially to state law to determine what rights the taxpayer has in\n\nthe property the Government seeks to reach, then to federal law to\n\ndetermine whether the taxpayer's state-delineated rights qualify as\n\n'property' or 'rights to property' within the compass of the\n\n\n     any right, title, or interest, to the payment of such tax\n     or liability. . . .\n\n     (b) Parties.--All persons having liens upon or claiming\n     any interest in the property involved in such action\n     shall be made parties thereto.\n\n     (c)   Adjudication    and   decree.--The   court    shall\n     . . . proceed to adjudicate all matters involved [in the\n     action] and finally determine the merits of all claims to\n     and liens upon the property, and, in all cases where a\n     claim or interest of the United States therein is\n     established, may decree a sale of such property, by the\n     proper officer of the court, and a distribution of the\n     proceeds of such sale according to the findings of the\n     court in respect to the interests of the parties and of\n     the United States.\n\n                               -7-\n\ffederal tax lien legislation.\" (quoting Drye v. United States, 528\n\nU.S. 49, 58 (1999) (internal quotation marks omitted))); United\n\nStates v. Murray, 217 F.3d 59, 63 (1st Cir. 2000).                      Accordingly, in\n\nthe present case, the question of whether the Chestnut Street\n\nproperty was fraudulently transferred is a matter of Rhode Island\n\nlaw.    See R.I. Gen. Laws § 6-16-4; see also United States v.\n\nBryant, 15 F.3d 756, 758 (8th Cir. 1994).\n\n                If the government proceeds under 26 U.S.C. § 7403 to\n\nenforce a lien, once a court declares a transfer fraudulent and\n\nvoid,     the    asset       reverts        back    to    the    ownership       of   the\n\ndebtor-transferor and federal law governs the foreclosure of the\n\nlien and the selling of the asset.                   See 26 U.S.C. § 7403(c); 28\n\nU.S.C. §§ 2001, 2002.\n\n            In    contrast,       if       the   government     seeks    to   recover   a\n\ndebtor's tax deficiency in the form of a judgment against the\n\ntransferee, state law applies to set the amount of recovery.                          See\n\nComm'r v. Stern, 357 U.S. 39, 44-45 (1958) (holding, in an action\n\narising    under    26       U.S.C.    §    6901,    which    provides     the   federal\n\ngovernment      with     a    procedural         remedy   against   transferees       for\n\ntransferors' tax liabilities, that state law governs the extent to\n\nwhich a transferee can be held liable); United States v. Westley,\n\n7 F.App'x 393, 399 (6th Cir. 2001) (unpublished decision) (holding\n\nthat state law controls the determination of transferees' liability\n\neven if the government does not proceed under § 6901); see also\n\n\n                                             -8-\n\fR.I.   Gen.    Laws   §    6-16-8   (defining         the   limits   on   transferee\n\nliability).\n\n              In the present case, the district court determined under\n\nstate law that the conveyance of 10 Chestnut Street was fraudulent,\n\nset aside the transfer of the property, and issued judgment against\n\nRosalina and the property, pursuant to 26 U.S.C. § 7403, as well as\n\nagainst the transferee, Dennis, for $196,000 plus post-judgment\n\ninterest.      See Verduchi, 2005 WL 1027017, at *7.\n\n              On appeal, Dennis does not contest the district court's\n\ndetermination       that   the   property       was   fraudulently    transferred.\n\nInstead, he takes issue only with the district court's remedy,\n\narguing that, pursuant to certain provisions of the Rhode Island\n\nFraudulent Transfer Act, R.I. Gen. Laws § 6-16-8(b), (c), \"[t]he\n\njudgment is wrong because it awards the United States the current\n\nmarket value of 10 Chestnut Street even though the law states\n\nclearly that creditors may recover only the value of the asset at\n\nthe time of the transfer.\"\n\n              Although Dennis does not specify which portion of the\n\njudgment he is contesting, we understand him to be appealing only\n\nthe money judgment against him, not the judgments against Rosalina\n\nand the property, for three reasons.                    First, Rosalina has not\n\ncontested     the   amount    of    her   tax    liability,     which     appellants\n\nacknowledge is far greater than the current market value of the\n\nproperty.      Thus, once the transfer is voided and the ownership of\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\fthe    Chestnut        Street    property     is     reverted        to    Rosalina,        the\n\ngovernment is entitled to force the sale of the property and to\n\ncollect all the proceeds in excess of Option One's take.                                 See 26\n\nU.S.C. §§ 6321, 6323(a), 7403.\n\n             Second, the Rhode Island statute Dennis invokes solely\n\ngoverns    transferee       liability.             See   R.I.   Gen.       Laws      §   6-16-8\n\n(\"Defenses, liability, and protection of transferee.\").                              Because a\n\njudgment pursuant to 26 U.S.C. § 7403 is essentially a judgment\n\nagainst the property, see Rodgers, 461 U.S. at 695 (likening § 7403\n\nto an in rem proceeding), or against the debtor-transferor, not\n\nagainst the transferee, R.I. Gen. Laws § 6-16-8 can apply to limit\n\nonly   the   money       judgment      against      Dennis,     not       the    amount      the\n\ngovernment can recover from the sale of the property.\n\n             Further, the government in its brief framed the issue on\n\nappeal as \"[w]hether the district court erred in entering judgment\n\nagainst Dennis Verduchi for $196,000.\"                    The government also noted\n\nthat   \"Rosalina        raised    no    defense      to   the    amount         of    the   tax\n\nliabilities\" -- and by implication to the amount of the lien on the\n\nproperty     --    \"except       for   her    contention        that      they       had    been\n\ndischarged        in    bankruptcy.\"         Appellants         do    not       contest     the\n\ngovernment's characterizations, and we proceed accordingly.\n\n                                             II.\n\n             As to the money judgment against him, Dennis argues that\n\nby requiring him to pay $196,000 plus post-judgment interest, the\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\fdistrict court was essentially penalizing him as transferee by\n\nawarding the government the current market value of the property,\n\nin violation of certain provisions of the Rhode Island Fraudulent\n\nTransfer Act.   See R.I. Gen. Laws § 6-16-8(b), (c).6   He asks that\n\nthe judgment be reversed or, alternatively, that it be vacated and\n\nthe matter remanded.\n\n          The Rhode Island statute provides, in relevant part:\n\n          (b) Except as otherwise provided in this\n          section, to the extent a transfer is voidable\n          in an action by a creditor . . . , the\n          creditor may recover judgment for the value of\n          the asset transferred, as adjusted under\n          subsection (c) of this section, or the amount\n          necessary to satisfy the creditor's claim,\n          whichever is less.      The judgment may be\n          entered against:\n\n                  (1) The first transferee of the asset\n                  or the person for whose benefit the\n                  transfer was made; or\n\n                  (2) Any subsequent transferee other\n                  than a good faith transferee who took\n                  for value or from any subsequent\n                  transferee.\n\n          (c) If the judgment under subsection (b) is\n          based upon the value of the asset transferred,\n          the judgment must be for an amount equal to\n          the value of the asset at the time of the\n          transfer, subject to adjustment as the\n          equities may require.\n\n\n     6\n          Both parties have assumed that this provision governs the\noutcome of this appeal, an assumption that we will accept for the\npurpose of argument. We note, however, that the district court did\nnot cite to state statutory authority in the remedial portion of\nits opinion. We also note that this is not a proceeding under 26\nU.S.C. § 6901, and neither the district court nor the parties\ncontends that it is.\n\n                               -11-\n\fR.I. Gen. Laws § 6-16-8. Subsection (b) permits the creditor, here\n\nthe government, to recover judgment against Dennis for the lesser\n\nof (1) the value of asset transferred, as adjusted under subsection\n\n(c), or (2) the amount necessary to satisfy the creditor's claim.\n\nAt the time of the fraudulent conveyance judgment, the amount\n\nneeded to satisfy the government's claim was in excess of $875,000.\n\n           Dennis admits that the value of the property is less than\n\nthe amount necessary to satisfy the government's claim.                 He argues\n\nthat this means the \"whichever is less\" sum in subsection (b)\n\nrequires reference to subsection (c), which is explicit that the\n\njudgment \"must be for an amount equal to the value of the asset at\n\nthe time of the transfer,\" subject to equitable adjustment.                     The\n\ndistrict court failed, he says, to make the needed express finding\n\nabout the value of the asset at the time of the transfer in 1992.\n\nOnly after it determined the value of the asset, he argues, could\n\nthe court adjust for the equities.\n\n           There     is    no   doubt   the    district   judge   was   aware    of\n\nDennis's argument about the limitations imposed by R.I. Gen. Laws\n\n§   6-16-8(c)   on   the    judgment    against    the    transferee.     Dennis\n\nadvanced this argument at trial.\n\n           The government responds that the district court simply\n\nmade an equitable decision, as permitted under the Rhode Island\n\nstatute, that in order to make the government whole, Dennis should\n\nhave to pay back to the government the amount of $196,000 plus\n\n                                        -12-\n\finterest    to   offset   the     diminishment       of   the    proceeds      of   the\n\nforfeiture sale by what Option One takes.                 We agree that this is\n\nwhat happened and that there was nothing impermissible about the\n\ncourt's approach.\n\n            In the end, Dennis's appeal rests on three propositions.\n\nThe first is that under R.I. Gen. Laws § 6-16-8(b) and (c), a court\n\nmust    follow   a    sequence    of    decisionmaking:         before   making      an\n\nequitable adjustment, the court must explicitly make a finding of\n\nthe value of property at the time of the transfer.                   Dennis argues\n\nthat the burden of showing that time-of-transfer value falls on the\n\ngovernment, and that the judgment must either be reversed because\n\nthe government failed to make that showing or at least be remanded\n\nto   the   district    court     to    make   such   a    finding.       The   second\n\nproposition is that the order is contrary to the commentary to the\n\nUFTA.   The third is that the award cannot be justified on equitable\n\ngrounds.\n\n            The district court cited two Rhode Island cases, Spaziano\n\nv. Spaziano, 410 A.2d 113 (R.I. 1980), and Nisenzon v. Sadowski,\n\n689 A.2d 1037 (R.I. 1997), each authorizing equitable adjustment.\n\nAs the district court noted, Spaziano gave it ample authority under\n\nRhode Island's general equitable law to enter a money judgment\n\nagainst Dennis in addition to a judgment against the property.                       In\n\nSpaziano, the court held that a money judgment against a transferee\n\nof a fraudulently conveyed property is permissible \"where such\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\ftransferee has disposed of or dealt with the property . . . in such\n\nfashion   that   a   return   of    the   property   is    impossible   or   in\n\nsituations in which the property has been diminished in value.\"\n\n410 A.2d at 115.       And in Nisenzon, the Supreme Court of Rhode\n\nIsland recognized that the state trial courts have wide latitude to\n\ncraft equitable remedies.7         See 689 A.2d at 1050.\n\n           Nothing in the Rhode Island statute compels the court to\n\nmake an express finding before addressing equitable concerns.                It\n\nis commonplace that courts usually need not in their opinions be\n\nexplicit about every detail of an analysis.               See, e.g., Walgreen\n\nCo. v. Sara Creek Prop. Co., B.V., 966 F.2d 273, 276-77 (7th Cir.\n\n1992) (stating that a \"judge is not required to explicate every\n\ndetail of the analysis\" in determining the appropriateness of\n\ninjunctive relief).\n\n           Spaziano and Nisenzon also lead to the rejection of\n\nanother of Dennis's arguments -- that the order violated the\n\ncommentary to UFTA,8 which states:\n\n\n     7\n          Although in Nisenzon, the damages award was fixed by the\namount of the claim rather than the value of the property, the\ncourt approvingly cited the proposition that \"equity will not allow\nitself to be frustrated but will adapt its relief to the exigencies\nof the case and will enter a money judgment if this will achieve an\nequitable result.\" Nisenzon, 689 A.2d at 1050 (quoting Spaziano,\n410 A.2d at 115 (quoting Damazo v. Wahby, 305 A.2d 138, 142 (Md.\n1973))).\n     8\n          Rhode Island enacted the Fraudulent Transfer Act in 1986,\nafter Spaziano was decided. See 1986 R.I. Pub. Laws ch. 438, § 2.\nDennis suggests that the statute displaced the common law\n(presumably including Spaziano).     But Nisenzon, decided after\n\n                                     -14-\n\f          The measure of the recovery of a defrauded\n          creditor against a fraudulent transferee is\n          usually limited to the value of the asset\n          transferred at the time of the transfer. The\n          premise of § 8(c) is that changes in value of\n          the asset transferred that occur after the\n          transfer should ordinarily not affect the\n          amount of the creditor's recovery.\n\nSee Unif. Fraudulent Transfer Act § 8 cmt. 3, 7A U.L.A. 654 (2004)\n\n(citations omitted).\n\n          The UFTA commentary itself only says that the transfer\n\nshould not \"ordinarily\" affect the amount of the recovery.         This\n\nstatement is consistent with the approach taken under the earlier\n\nUniform   Fraudulent   Conveyance   Act   (UFCA);   even   under   the\n\npredecessor UFCA, courts had carved out equitable adjustments.       It\n\nwas for that reason that the explicit equitable adjustment language\n\nwas added to the successor UFTA.      See Dahar v. Jackson (In re\n\nJackson), 318 B.R. 5, 27 (Bankr. D.N.H. 2004).\n\n          Often the exercise of the equitable adjustment power is\n\nmeant to protect the transferee, not the creditor.     The law sought\n\nto avoid giving creditors the windfall of the costs incurred by an\n\ninnocent transferee to improve the property.        See id.   This is\n\nsimilar, as Jackson notes, to a provision of the Bankruptcy Code,\n\n11 U.S.C. § 550(e), which provides to a good faith transferee a\n\n\n\nenactment of the UFTA, expressly cited Spaziano with approval. See\nNisenzon, 689 A.2d at 1044.        More importantly, the statute\nexplicitly grants the court authority to make equitable\nadjustments, whether or not it displaces the common law in some\nrespects. See R.I. Gen. Laws § 6-16-8(c).\n\n                               -15-\n\flien for improvements on the property.           Jackson, 318 B.R. at 27\n\nn.20.\n\n            Here, Dennis is in a vastly different position.                 The\n\ndistrict court did not characterize him as a particularly innocent\n\ntransferee, and the sums involved are not claimed to be from\n\nimprovements he made, but simply cash he took out of the property.\n\nFurther, Dennis paid nothing for the conveyance of the property to\n\nhim.    This is not, then, a situation in which Dennis as transferee\n\nis in a worse position than if he had never received the property.\n\nSee Stanko v. Comm'r, 209 F.3d 1082, 1087 n.5 (8th Cir. 2000).              Nor\n\nis this an instance where the remedy would result in Dennis's\n\ntransferee liability being greater than the transferor's liability.\n\nSee id. at 1087 n.6 (suggesting that it would be \"grossly unfair\"\n\nto impose on a transferee liability greater than that imposed upon\n\nthe transferor).\n\n            The statutory authorization in the UFTA for equitable\n\nadjustment does not say it is a one-way ratchet.           In discussing the\n\ngeneral    provision     for   equitable     adjustment,    the    commentary\n\nexplicitly    provides    protection   for    the   creditor      against   the\n\ndiminution of assets by the transferee.             See Unif. Fraudulent\n\nTransfer Act § 8 cmt. 3 (\"If the value of the asset has been\n\ndiminished by severance and disposition of timber or minerals or\n\nfixtures, the transferee should be liable for the amount of the\n\nresulting reduction.\"      (citing Damazo v. Wahby,        305 A.2d 138, 142\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\f(Md. 1973))).     That equitable discretion can surely be used to\n\navoid an unfair windfall to a not-so-innocent transferee at the\n\nexpense of an undersecured creditor.   That is particularly so when\n\nthe undersecured creditor is the federal government.     Cf. Rodgers,\n\n461 U.S. at 694 (discussing \"the policy inherent in the [federal]\n\ntax statutes in favor of the prompt and certain collection of\n\ndelinquent taxes\"). Moreover, just as the commentary suggests that\n\na \"good faith transferee should be reimbursed\" for his contribution\n\n\"if the value of the asset at the time of levy and sale to enforce\n\nthe judgment of the creditor has been enhanced by . . . [the]\n\ndischarge of liens on the property,\" we see no reason why equity\n\nwould not allow for a money judgment against a transferee who has\n\ndecreased the value of the property by encumbering it with a\n\nmortgage.    Unif. Fraudulent Transfer Act § 8 cmt. 3.\n\n            This gets us into Dennis's remaining argument that the\n\nresult is not equitable for other reasons.    The argument is that\n\ndue to appreciation of the property, the present judgment more\n\nlikely than not exceeds the sum of any judgment that would have\n\nbeen entered based on the 1992 value of the house even if interest\n\nwere allowed from the date of the transfer.        Further, Dennis\n\nargues, it was unfair for the court to hold him liable for the\n\nprejudgment interest owed by his parents.       He argues that no\n\nprejudgment interest can be awarded because the Rhode Island\n\nstatute does not explicitly allow for it.    Even if such interest\n\n\n                                -17-\n\fcould be awarded, Dennis posits, it would run only from the 2003\n\nnotice of the IRS's claim against him and be at most a few thousand\n\ndollars.\n\n           We address his argument about prejudgment interest first.\n\nDennis misunderstands the nature of the district court's judgment\n\nagainst him.      As transferee, he is not personally liable for any\n\nprejudgment      interest;    the     only    judgment    against   him   is    for\n\n$196,000, plus post-judgment interest, and that value was set by\n\nthe mortgage he placed on the property.                   The only prejudgment\n\ninterest accrued was on his parents' debt, and the interest due on\n\ntheir tax liabilities is a matter of federal, not Rhode Island,\n\nlaw.   See 26 U.S.C. § 6601.\n\n           As to Dennis's other argument, there are a few responses.\n\nOne is that it is Dennis who seeks to use the 1992 valuation as a\n\nshield against an equitable alteration meant to make the government\n\nwhole.     But    Dennis     failed    to    produce     any   evidence   of   that\n\nvaluation, and thus his arguments are speculative at most.\n\n           A second response is that whatever the value of the\n\nproperty now, it is axiomatic that the fraudulent transfer of\n\nproperty does not affect the amount of the lien.               See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Bess, 357 U.S. 51, 57 (1958) (noting that \"[t]he transfer\n\nof property subsequent to the attachment of the lien does not\n\naffect the lien, for 'it is the very nature and essence of a lien,\n\nthat no matter into whose hands the property goes, it passes cum\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\fonere'\" (quoting Burton v. Smith, 38 U.S. (13 Pet.) 464, 483\n\n(1839))); see also Rogers, 461 U.S. at 701 (\"[Section] 7403 . . .\n\ngives the Federal Government the opportunity to seek the highest\n\nreturn possible on the forced sale of property interests liable for\n\nthe payment of federal taxes.\").      The district court simply used\n\nthe value of the assessment against Rosalina and accumulated\n\ninterest to set the underlying debt owed.     See 26 U.S.C. §§ 6321,\n\n6601.   The tax debt owed by Rosalina was at the time of the\n\njudgment, with interest, over $875,000.    The debt is large because\n\nthe Verduchis stalled payment of the taxes they owed for over\n\nfifteen years, including a decade after the Tax Court decision\n\ndetermining their tax deficiencies became final.\n\n          Even with the entry of this judgment, the United States\n\nwill likely receive only a fraction of the total sum it is owed.\n\nFurther, Dennis, who is hardly free from blame, has had the benefit\n\nof use of the house for himself and his parents, apparently\n\nmortgage-free, until he chose to mortgage the property.     Had the\n\nproperty been sold earlier to satisfy the debt, Dennis would not\n\nhave been in a position to take out the $196,000 mortgage.       The\n\neffect of the district court order is to try to place the parties\n\ninto the position they would have been in had no fraudulent\n\ntransfer taken place.   Cf. Rodgers, 461 U.S. at 701 (\"[Section]\n\n7403 is intended . . . to reach the entire property in which a\n\n\n\n\n                               -19-\n\fdelinquent taxpayer has or had any 'right, title, or interest . . . .'\").\n\n            Equitable    determinations    such   as   these   are   clearly\n\ncommitted to the trial court's discretion and are reviewed only for\n\nabuse of discretion.      Cf., e.g., Gordon Sel-Way, Inc. v. United\n\nStates (In re Gordon Sel-Way, Inc.), 270 F.3d 280, 289 (6th Cir.\n\n2001)   (noting   that    review   of     bankruptcy   court's   equitable\n\ndeterminations is for abuse of discretion). While Dennis disagrees\n\nwith the ruling, he has not explained why this result is an abuse.\n\nIndeed, the result reached by the trial judge here was entirely\n\nsensible.\n\n            We affirm the judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -20-\n\f",

Laws &#167; 6-16-8 (defining the limits on transferee liability).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the present case, the district court determined under state law that the conveyance of 10 Chestnut Street was fraudulent, set aside the transfer of the property, and issued judgment against Rosalina and the property, pursuant to 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7403, as well as against the transferee, Dennis, for $196,000 plus post-judgment interest. <i>See Verduchi,</i> 2005 WL 1027017, at *7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Dennis does not contest the district court's determination that the property was fraudulently transferred. Instead, he takes issue only with the district court's remedy, arguing that, pursuant to certain provisions of the Rhode Island Fraudulent Transfer Act, R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 6-16-8(b), (c), \"[t]he judgment is wrong because it awards the United States the <i>current</i> market value of 10 Chestnut Street even though the law states clearly that creditors may recover only the value of the asset <i>at the time of the transfer.</i>\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Dennis does not specify which portion of the judgment he is contesting, we understand him to be appealing only the money judgment against him, not the judgments against Rosalina and the property, for three reasons. First, Rosalina has not contested the amount of her tax liability, which appellants acknowledge is far greater than the current market value of the property. Thus, once the transfer is voided and the ownership of the Chestnut Street property is reverted to Rosalina, the government is entitled to force the sale of the property and to collect all the proceeds in excess of Option One's take. <i>See</i> 26 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 6321, 6323(a), 7403.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the Rhode Island statute Dennis invokes solely governs transferee liability. <i>See</i> R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 6-16-8 (\"Defenses, liability, and protection of transferee.\"). Because a judgment pursuant to 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7403 is essentially a judgment against the property, <i>see Rodgers,</i> 461 U.S. at 695, 103 S.Ct. 2132 (likening &#167; 7403 to an in rem proceeding), or against the debtor-transferor, not against the transferee, R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 6-16-8 can apply to limit only the money judgment against Dennis, not the amount the government can recover from the sale of the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the government in its brief framed the issue on appeal as \"[w]hether the district court erred in entering judgment against Dennis Verduchi for $196,000.\" The government also noted that \"Rosalina raised no defense to the amount of the tax liabilities\" &#8212; and by implication to the amount of the lien on the property &#8212; \"except for her contention that they had been discharged in bankruptcy.\" Appellants do not contest the government's characterizations, and we proceed accordingly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the money judgment against him, Dennis argues that by requiring him to pay $196,000 plus post-judgment interest, the district court was essentially penalizing him as transferee by awarding the government the current market value of the property, in violation of certain provisions of the Rhode Island Fraudulent Transfer Act. <i>See</i> R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 6-16-8(b), (c).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> He asks that the judgment be reversed or, alternatively, that it be vacated and the matter remanded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Rhode Island statute provides, in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) Except as otherwise provided in this section, to the extent a transfer is voidable in an action by a creditor . . ., the creditor may recover judgment for the value of the asset transferred, as adjusted under subsection (c) of this section, or the amount necessary to satisfy the creditor's claim, whichever is less. The judgment may be entered against:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) The first transferee of the asset or the person for whose benefit the transfer was made; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) Any subsequent transferee other than a good faith transferee who took for value or from any subsequent transferee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(c) If the judgment under subsection (b) is based upon the value of the asset transferred, the judgment must be for an amount equal to the value of the asset at the time of the transfer, subject to adjustment as the equities may require.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 6-16-8. Subsection (b) permits the creditor, here the government, to recover judgment against Dennis for the lesser of (1) the value of asset transferred, as adjusted under subsection (c), or (2) the amount necessary to satisfy the creditor's claim. At the time of the fraudulent conveyance judgment, the amount needed to satisfy the government's claim was in excess of $875,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dennis admits that the value of the property is less than the amount necessary to satisfy the government's claim. He argues that this means the \"whichever is less\" sum in subsection (b) requires reference to subsection (c), which is explicit that the judgment \"must be for an amount equal to the value of the asset at the time of the transfer,\" subject to equitable adjustment. The district court failed, he says, to make the needed express finding about the value of the asset at the time of the transfer in 1992. Only after it determined the value of the asset, he argues, could the court adjust for the equities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no doubt the district judge was aware of Dennis's argument about the limitations imposed by R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 6-16-8(c) on the judgment against the transferee. Dennis advanced this argument at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government responds that the district court simply made an equitable decision, as permitted under the Rhode Island statute, that in order to make the government whole, Dennis should have to pay back to the government the amount of $196,000 plus interest to offset the diminishment of the proceeds of the forfeiture sale by what Option One takes. We agree that this is what happened and that there was nothing impermissible about the court's approach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, Dennis's appeal rests on three propositions. The first is that under R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 6-16-8(b) and (c), a court must follow a sequence of decisionmaking: before making an equitable adjustment, the court must explicitly make a finding of the value of property at the time of the transfer. Dennis argues that the burden of showing that time-of-transfer value falls on the government, and that the judgment must either be reversed because the government failed to make that showing or at least be remanded to the district court to make such a finding. The second proposition is that the order is contrary to the commentary to the UFTA. The third is that the award cannot be justified on equitable grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court cited two Rhode Island cases, <i>Spaziano v. Spaziano,</i> 122 R.I. 518, 410 A.2d 113 (1980), and <i>Nisenzon v. Sadowski,</i> 689 A.2d 1037 (R.I.1997), each authorizing equitable adjustment. As the district court noted, <i>Spaziano</i> gave it ample authority under Rhode Island's general equitable law to enter a money judgment against Dennis in addition to a judgment against the property. In <i>Spaziano,</i> the court held that a money judgment against a transferee of a fraudulently conveyed property is permissible \"where such transferee has disposed of or dealt with the property. . . in such fashion that a return of the property is impossible or in situations in which the property has been diminished in value.\" 410 A.2d at 115. And in <i>Nisenzon,</i> the Supreme Court of Rhode Island recognized that the state trial courts have wide latitude to craft equitable remedies.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> <i>See</i> 689 A.2d at 1050.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in the Rhode Island statute compels the court to make an express finding before addressing equitable concerns. It is commonplace that courts usually need not in their opinions be explicit about every detail of an analysis. <i>See, e.g., Walgreen Co. v. Sara Creek Prop. Co., B.V.,</i> 966 F.2d 273, 276-77 (7th Cir.1992) (stating that a \"judge is not required to explicate every detail of the analysis\" in determining the appropriateness of injunctive relief).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Spaziano</i> and <i>Nisenzon</i> also lead to the rejection of another of Dennis's arguments &#8212; that the order violated the commentary to UFTA,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> which states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The measure of the recovery of a defrauded creditor against a fraudulent transferee is usually limited to the value of the asset transferred at the time of the transfer. The premise of &#167; 8(c) is that changes in value of the asset transferred that occur after the transfer should ordinarily not affect the amount of the creditor's recovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>See</i> Unif. Fraudulent Transfer Act &#167; 8 cmt. 3, 7A U.L.A. 654 (2004) (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The UFTA commentary itself only says that the transfer should not \"ordinarily\" affect the amount of the recovery. This statement is consistent with the approach taken under the earlier Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act (UFCA); even under the predecessor UFCA, courts had carved out equitable adjustments. It was for that reason that the explicit equitable adjustment language was added to the successor UFTA. <i>See Dahar v. Jackson</i> (<i>In re Jackson</i>), 318 B.R. 5, 27 (Bankr.D.N.H.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Often the exercise of the equitable adjustment power is meant to protect the transferee, not the creditor. The law sought to avoid giving creditors the windfall of the costs incurred by an innocent transferee to improve the property. <i>See id.</i> This is similar, as <i>Jackson</i> notes, to a provision of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. &#167; 550(e), which provides to a good faith transferee a lien for improvements on the property. <i>Jackson,</i> 318 B.R. at 27 n. 20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Dennis is in a vastly different position. The district court did not characterize him as a particularly innocent transferee, and the sums involved are not claimed to be from improvements he made, but simply cash he took out of the property. Further, Dennis paid nothing for the conveyance of the property to him. This is not, then, a situation in which Dennis as transferee is in a worse position than if he had never received the property. <i>See Stanko v. Comm'r,</i> 209 F.3d 1082, 1087 n. 5 (8th Cir.2000). Nor is this an instance where the remedy would result in Dennis's transferee liability being greater than the transferor's liability. <i>See id.</i> at 1087 n. 6 (suggesting that it would be \"grossly unfair\" to impose on a transferee liability greater than that imposed upon the transferor).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statutory authorization in the UFTA for equitable adjustment does not say it is a one-way ratchet. In discussing the general provision for equitable adjustment, the commentary explicitly provides protection for the creditor against the diminution of assets by the transferee. <i>See</i> Unif. Fraudulent Transfer Act &#167; 8 cmt. 3 (\"If the value of the asset has been diminished by severance and disposition of timber or minerals or fixtures, the transferee should be liable for the amount of the resulting reduction.\" (citing <i>Damazo v. Wahby,</i> 269 Md. 252, 305 A.2d 138, 142 (1973))). That equitable discretion can surely be used to avoid an unfair windfall to a not-so-innocent transferee at the expense of an undersecured creditor. That is particularly so when the undersecured creditor is the federal government. <i>Cf. Rodgers,</i> 461 U.S. at 694, 103 S.Ct. 2132 (discussing \"the policy inherent in the [federal] tax statutes in favor of the prompt and certain collection of delinquent taxes\"). Moreover, just as the commentary suggests that a \"good faith transferee should be reimbursed\" for his contribution \"if the value of the asset at the time of levy and sale to enforce the judgment of the creditor has been enhanced by . . . [the] discharge of liens on the property,\" we see no reason why equity would not allow for a money judgment against a transferee who has decreased the value of the property by encumbering it with a mortgage. Unif. Fraudulent Transfer Act &#167; 8 cmt. 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This gets us into Dennis's remaining argument that the result is not equitable for other reasons. The argument is that due to appreciation of the property, the present judgment more likely than not exceeds the sum of any judgment that would have been entered based on the 1992 value of the house even if interest were allowed from the date of the transfer. Further, Dennis argues, it was unfair for the court to hold him liable for the prejudgment interest owed by his parents. He argues that no prejudgment interest can be awarded because the Rhode Island statute does not explicitly allow for it. Even if such interest could be awarded, Dennis posits, it would run only from the 2003 notice of the IRS's claim against him and be at most a few thousand dollars.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We address his argument about prejudgment interest first. Dennis misunderstands the nature of the district court's judgment against him. As transferee, he is not personally liable for any prejudgment interest; the only judgment against him is for $196,000, plus <i>post</i>-judgment interest, and that value was set by the mortgage he placed on the property. The only prejudgment interest accrued was on his parents' debt, and the interest due on their tax liabilities is a matter of federal, not Rhode Island, law. <i>See</i> 26 U.S.C. &#167; 6601.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Dennis's other argument, there are a few responses. One is that it is Dennis who seeks to use the 1992 valuation as a shield against an equitable alteration meant to make the government whole. But Dennis failed to produce any evidence of that valuation, and thus his arguments are speculative at most.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second response is that whatever the value of the property now, it is axiomatic that the fraudulent transfer of property does not affect the amount of the lien. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Bess,</i> 357 U.S. 51, 57, 78 S.Ct. 1054, 2 L.Ed.2d 1135 (1958) (noting that \"[t]he transfer of property subsequent to the attachment of the lien does not affect the lien, for `it is the very nature and essence of a lien, that no matter into whose hands the property goes, it passes cum onere'\" (quoting <i>Burton v. Smith,</i> 38 U.S. (13 Pet.) 464, 483, 10 L.Ed. 248 (1839))); <i>see also Rodgers,</i> 461 U.S. at 701, 103 S.Ct. 2132 (\"[Section] 7403 . . . gives the Federal Government the opportunity to seek the highest return possible on the forced sale of property interests liable for the payment of federal taxes.\"). The district court simply used the value of the assessment against Rosalina and accumulated interest to set the underlying debt owed. <i>See</i> 26 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 6321, 6601. The tax debt owed by Rosalina was at the time of the judgment, with interest, over $875,000. The debt is large because the Verduchis stalled payment of the taxes they owed for over fifteen years, including a decade after the Tax Court decision determining their tax deficiencies became final.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even with the entry of this judgment, the United States will likely receive only a fraction of the total sum it is owed. Further, Dennis, who is hardly free from blame, has had the benefit of use of the house for himself and his parents, apparently mortgage-free, until he chose to mortgage the property. Had the property been sold earlier to satisfy the debt, Dennis would not have been in a position to take out the $196,000 mortgage. The effect of the district court order is to try to place the parties into the position they would have been in had no fraudulent transfer taken place. <i>Cf. Rodgers,</i> 461 U.S. at 701, 103 S.Ct. 2132 (\"[Section] 7403 is intended. . . to reach the entire property in which a delinquent taxpayer has or had any `right, title, or interest. . . .'\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Equitable determinations such as these are clearly committed to the trial court's discretion and are reviewed only for abuse of discretion. <i>Cf., e.g., Gordon Sel-Way, Inc. v. United States</i> (<i>In re Gordon Sel-Way, Inc.</i>), 270 F.3d 280, 289 (6th Cir.2001) (noting that review of bankruptcy court's equitable determinations is for abuse of discretion). While Dennis disagrees with the ruling, he has not explained why this result is an abuse. Indeed, the result reached by the trial judge here was entirely sensible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We <i>affirm</i> the judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Verduchis and the IRS had agreed to be bound by the outcome of<i>Schwartz,</i> which involved a taxpayer who had participated in the same tax shelter as the Verduchis had.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Cal Verduchi died in 1998</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Dennis has never asserted that he has paid off any part of the mortgage or that Option One's take would be less than $196,000</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> While nominally both Rosalina and Dennis are listed as appellants, in fact this appeal concerns only Dennis's challenge to the judgment against him for $196,000</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Section 7403 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(a) Filing.&#8212;In any case where there has been a refusal or neglect to pay any tax, or to discharge any liability in respect thereof, whether or not levy has been made, the Attorney General or his delegate, at the request of the Secretary, may direct a civil action to be filed in a district court of the United States to enforce the lien of the United States under this title with respect to such tax or liability or to subject any property, of whatever nature, of the delinquent, or in which he has any right, title, or interest, to the payment of such tax or liability. . . .</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(b) Parties.&#8212;All persons having liens upon or claiming any interest in the property involved in such action shall be made parties thereto.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(c) Adjudication and decree.&#8212;The court shall . . . proceed to adjudicate all matters involved [in the action] and finally determine the merits of all claims to and liens upon the property, and, in all cases where a claim or interest of the United States therein is established, may decree a sale of such property, by the proper officer of the court, and a distribution of the proceeds of such sale according to the findings of the court in respect to the interests of the parties and of the United States.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Both parties have assumed that this provision governs the outcome of this appeal, an assumption that we will accept for the purpose of argument.

Laws &#167;&#167; 6-16-1 to -12, restricts a court, in setting aside a fraudulent conveyance, to awarding against the transferee a money judgment that is limited to the value of the property <i>at the time of the transfer.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 14, 1992, Rosalina Verduchi and her husband Coriolano (\"Cal\") transferred their home at 10 Chestnut Street, North Providence, to their son, Dennis, for no consideration. The problem was that they made this \"gift\" while they owed the IRS more than $82,000 in taxes and interest, as had been finally adjudicated in court a year earlier. <i>See Schwartz v. Comm'r,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">930</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">920</span></span> (9th Cir.1991) (unpublished table decision).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 18, 1993, the IRS issued an assessment against Rosalina and Cal for their tax liability, which by then had ballooned to almost $400,000 because of interest. A federal tax lien arose on all of the Verduchis' property upon the date of assessment, <i>see</i> 26 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 6321, 6322, and in January 1994, the IRS filed its notice of tax lien.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rosalina and Cal successfully went through bankruptcy proceedings in 1996 and discharged their debts. But the discharge did not apply to any tax obligation that the debtors sought to avoid by fraudulently conveying property that would have been available to satisfy that debt. <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167; 523(a)(1)(C). In April 2003, the United States brought suit against Rosalina and Dennis pursuant to 26 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 7401 and 7403,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> seeking to reduce Rosalina's unpaid tax liabilities to judgment, to set aside the transfer of the Chestnut Street property as fraudulent, and to foreclose the federal tax lien against the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government learned in discovery that Dennis, on November 5, 2002, had given a mortgage on 10 Chestnut Street to Option One Mortgage Corporation (\"Option One\") in exchange for $196,000. It then filed an amended complaint on March 2, 2004 naming Option One as a defendant with an interest. <i>See</i> 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7403(b).

Initially, these two remedies were sought in the alternative; however, in a pre-trial memorandum submitted to the district court on June 9, 2004, the government stated its intention to seek foreclosure of the lien, as well as a money judgment against Dennis for $196,000, plus interest, representing the amount of the mortgage he had taken out on the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a bench trial on November 8, 2004, the district court held that the transfer of the Chestnut Street property to Dennis was fraudulent, set aside the transfer, and ordered that the federal tax lien should be foreclosed and the property sold. <i>See United States v.

First, Rosalina has not contested the amount of her tax liability, which appellants acknowledge is far greater than the current market value of the property. Thus, once the transfer is voided and the ownership of the Chestnut Street property is reverted to Rosalina, the government is entitled to force the sale of the property and to collect all the proceeds in excess of Option One's take. <i>See</i> 26 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 6321, 6323(a), 7403.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the Rhode Island statute Dennis invokes solely governs transferee liability. <i>See</i> R.I.

Subsection (b) permits the creditor, here the government, to recover judgment against Dennis for the lesser of (1) the value of asset transferred, as adjusted under subsection (c), or (2) the amount necessary to satisfy the creditor's claim. At the time of the fraudulent conveyance judgment, the amount needed to satisfy the government's claim was in excess of $875,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dennis admits that the value of the property is less than the amount necessary to satisfy the government's claim. He argues that this means the \"whichever is less\" sum in subsection (b) requires reference to subsection (c), which is explicit that the judgment \"must be for an amount equal to the value of the asset at the time of the transfer,\" subject to equitable adjustment. The district court failed, he says, to make the needed express finding about the value of the asset at the time of the transfer in 1992. Only after it determined the value of the asset, he argues, could the court adjust for the equities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no doubt the district judge was aware of Dennis's argument about the limitations imposed by R.I.

We agree that this is what happened and that there was nothing impermissible about the court's approach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, Dennis's appeal rests on three propositions. The first is that under R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 6-16-8(b) and (c), a court must follow a sequence of decisionmaking: before making an equitable adjustment, the court must explicitly make a finding of the value of property at the time of the transfer. Dennis argues that the burden of showing that time-of-transfer value falls on the government, and that the judgment must either be reversed because the government failed to make that showing or at least be remanded to the district court to make such a finding. The second proposition is that the order is contrary to the commentary to the UFTA. The third is that the award cannot be justified on equitable grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court cited two Rhode Island cases, <i>Spaziano v.

As the district court noted, <i>Spaziano</i> gave it ample authority under Rhode Island's general equitable law to enter a money judgment against Dennis in addition to a judgment against the property. In <i>Spaziano,</i> the court held that a money judgment against a transferee of a fraudulently conveyed property is permissible \"where such transferee has disposed of or dealt with the property. . . in such fashion that a return of the property is impossible or in situations in which the property has been diminished in value.\" 410 A.2d at 115. And in <i>Nisenzon,</i> the Supreme Court of Rhode Island recognized that the state trial courts have wide latitude to craft equitable remedies.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> <i>See</i> 689 A.2d at 1050.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in the Rhode Island statute compels the court to make an express finding before addressing equitable concerns.

Co., B.V.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584238\"><a href=\"/opinion/584238/walgreen-company-v-sara-creek-property-company-b-v-aka-sara-creek/\"><span class=\"volume\">966</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">273</span></a></span>, 276-77 (7th Cir.1992) (stating that a \"judge is not required to explicate every detail of the analysis\" in determining the appropriateness of injunctive relief).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Spaziano</i> and <i>Nisenzon</i> also lead to the rejection of another of Dennis's arguments &#8212; that the order violated the commentary to UFTA,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> which states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The measure of the recovery of a defrauded creditor against a fraudulent transferee is usually limited to the value of the asset transferred at the time of the transfer. The premise of &#167; 8(c) is that changes in value of the asset transferred that occur after the transfer should ordinarily not affect the amount of the creditor's recovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>See</i> Unif. Fraudulent Transfer Act &#167; 8 cmt. 3, 7A U.L.A. 654 (2004) (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The UFTA commentary itself only says that the transfer should not \"ordinarily\" affect the amount of the recovery. This statement is consistent with the approach taken under the earlier Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act (UFCA); even under the predecessor UFCA, courts had carved out equitable adjustments. It was for that reason that the explicit equitable adjustment language was added to the successor UFTA. <i>See Dahar v. Jackson</i> (<i>In re Jackson</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1874234\"><a href=\"/opinion/1874234/in-re-jackson/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 27 (Bankr.D.N.H.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Often the exercise of the equitable adjustment power is meant to protect the transferee, not the creditor. The law sought to avoid giving creditors the windfall of the costs incurred by an innocent transferee to improve the property. <i>See id.</i> This is similar, as <i>Jackson</i> notes, to a provision of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. &#167; 550(e), which provides to a good faith transferee a lien for improvements on the property. <i>Jackson,</i> 318 B.R. at 27 n. 20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Dennis is in a vastly different position. The district court did not characterize him as a particularly innocent transferee, and the sums involved are not claimed to be from improvements he made, but simply cash he took out of the property. Further, Dennis paid nothing for the conveyance of the property to him. This is not, then, a situation in which Dennis as transferee is in a worse position than if he had never received the property. <i>See Stanko v. Comm'r,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768405\"><a href=\"/opinion/768405/jean-a-stanko-v-commissioner-of-internal-revenue/\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1082</span></a></span>, 1087 n. 5 (8th Cir.2000). Nor is this an instance where the remedy would result in Dennis's transferee liability being greater than the transferor's liability. <i>See id.</i> at 1087 n. 6 (suggesting that it would be \"grossly unfair\" to impose on a transferee liability greater than that imposed upon the transferor).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statutory authorization in the UFTA for equitable adjustment does not say it is a one-way ratchet. In discussing the general provision for equitable adjustment, the commentary explicitly provides protection for the creditor against the diminution of assets by the transferee. <i>See</i> Unif. Fraudulent Transfer Act &#167; 8 cmt. 3 (\"If the value of the asset has been diminished by severance and disposition of timber or minerals or fixtures, the transferee should be liable for the amount of the resulting reduction.\" (citing <i>Damazo v. Wahby,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2388540\"><a href=\"/opinion/2388540/damazo-v-wahby/\"><span class=\"volume\">269</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Md.</span> <span class=\"page\">252</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2388540\"><a href=\"/opinion/2388540/damazo-v-wahby/\"><span class=\"volume\">305</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">138</span></a></span>, 142 (1973))). That equitable discretion can surely be used to avoid an unfair windfall to a not-so-innocent transferee at the expense of an undersecured creditor. That is particularly so when the undersecured creditor is the federal government. <i>Cf. Rodgers,</i> 461 U.S. at 694, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110942\"><a href=\"/opinion/110942/united-states-v-rodgers/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2132</span></a></span> (discussing \"the policy inherent in the [federal] tax statutes in favor of the prompt and certain collection of delinquent taxes\"). Moreover, just as the commentary suggests that a \"good faith transferee should be reimbursed\" for his contribution \"if the value of the asset at the time of levy and sale to enforce the judgment of the creditor has been enhanced by . . . [the] discharge of liens on the property,\" we see no reason why equity would not allow for a money judgment against a transferee who has decreased the value of the property by encumbering it with a mortgage. Unif. Fraudulent Transfer Act &#167; 8 cmt. 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This gets us into Dennis's remaining argument that the result is not equitable for other reasons. The argument is that due to appreciation of the property, the present judgment more likely than not exceeds the sum of any judgment that would have been entered based on the 1992 value of the house even if interest were allowed from the date of the transfer. Further, Dennis argues, it was unfair for the court to hold him liable for the prejudgment interest owed by his parents. He argues that no prejudgment interest can be awarded because the Rhode Island statute does not explicitly allow for it. Even if such interest could be awarded, Dennis posits, it would run only from the 2003 notice of the IRS's claim against him and be at most a few thousand dollars.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We address his argument about prejudgment interest first. Dennis misunderstands the nature of the district court's judgment against him. As transferee, he is not personally liable for any prejudgment interest; the only judgment against him is for $196,000, plus <i>post</i>-judgment interest, and that value was set by the mortgage he placed on the property. The only prejudgment interest accrued was on his parents' debt, and the interest due on their tax liabilities is a matter of federal, not Rhode Island, law. <i>See</i> 26 U.S.C. &#167; 6601.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Dennis's other argument, there are a few responses. One is that it is Dennis who seeks to use the 1992 valuation as a shield against an equitable alteration meant to make the government whole. But Dennis failed to produce any evidence of that valuation, and thus his arguments are speculative at most.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second response is that whatever the value of the property now, it is axiomatic that the fraudulent transfer of property does not affect the amount of the lien. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Bess,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105712\"><a href=\"/opinion/105712/united-states-v-bess/\"><span class=\"volume\">357</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span>, 57, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105712\"><a href=\"/opinion/105712/united-states-v-bess/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1135</span></a></span> (1958) (noting that \"[t]he transfer of property subsequent to the attachment of the lien does not affect the lien, for `it is the very nature and essence of a lien, that no matter into whose hands the property goes, it passes cum onere'\" (quoting <i>Burton v. Smith,</i> 38 U.S. (13 Pet.) 464, 483, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">248</span></span> (1839))); <i>see also Rodgers,</i> 461 U.S. at 701, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110942\"><a href=\"/opinion/110942/united-states-v-rodgers/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2132</span></a></span> (\"[Section] 7403 . . . gives the Federal Government the opportunity to seek the highest return possible on the forced sale of property interests liable for the payment of federal taxes.\"). The district court simply used the value of the assessment against Rosalina and accumulated interest to set the underlying debt owed. <i>See</i> 26 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 6321, 6601. The tax debt owed by Rosalina was at the time of the judgment, with interest, over $875,000. The debt is large because the Verduchis stalled payment of the taxes they owed for over fifteen years, including a decade after the Tax Court decision determining their tax deficiencies became final.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even with the entry of this judgment, the United States will likely receive only a fraction of the total sum it is owed. Further, Dennis, who is hardly free from blame, has had the benefit of use of the house for himself and his parents, apparently mortgage-free, until he chose to mortgage the property. Had the property been sold earlier to satisfy the debt, Dennis would not have been in a position to take out the $196,000 mortgage. The effect of the district court order is to try to place the parties into the position they would have been in had no fraudulent transfer taken place. <i>Cf. Rodgers,</i> 461 U.S. at 701, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110942\"><a href=\"/opinion/110942/united-states-v-rodgers/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

United States</i> (<i>In re Gordon Sel-Way, Inc.</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775412\"><a href=\"/opinion/775412/in-re-gordon-sel-way-inc-debtor-gordon-sel-way-inc-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">270</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">280</span></a></span>, 289 (6th Cir.2001) (noting that review of bankruptcy court's equitable determinations is for abuse of discretion). While Dennis disagrees with the ruling, he has not explained why this result is an abuse.
