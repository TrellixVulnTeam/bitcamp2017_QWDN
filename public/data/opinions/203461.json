George Z. Singal, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                        Lynch, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     B. Alan Seidler on brief for appellant and Boris Ayala on\nbrief pro se.\n     Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, and Paula D. Silsby,\nUnited States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           August 28, 2008\n\f            Per Curiam.        This is defendant Boris Ayala's direct\n\nappeal from his sentence for conspiring to distribute and possess\n\nwith intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base (\"crack\") and\n\nfor possessing cocaine with intent to distribute.               After carefully\n\nconsidering      defendant's   counseled      and   pro   se    briefs     and   the\n\nunderlying district court record, we affirm the sentence for the\n\nreasons discussed below.\n\nA.    Issues Related to Crack/Powder Cocaine Disparity\n\n            In    his   counseled    brief,    defendant       argues     that   the\n\nguidelines' 100-to-1 crack/powder ratio1 violates equal protection\n\nand due process because the recommended punishment for crack\n\noffenses is \"unconstitutionally harsh.\"             Because this argument is\n\nundeveloped and unsupported by any authority, we               need not address\n\nit at all.       United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.\n\n1990).     If we nevertheless did so, our review would be only for\n\nplain error because, as defendant concedes, this issue was not\n\nraised in the district court.           Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b); United\n\nStates v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732 (1993).           And, because this court\n\nhas   previously    upheld     the   constitutionality         of   the   100-to-1\n\ncrack/powder ratio against equal protection and Eighth Amendment\n\nproportionality challenges, United States v. Singleterry, 29 F.3d\n\n\n       1\n      Under the guidelines in effect at              the time of defendant's\nsentencing, the marijuana equivalent for            one gram of cocaine base\n(\"crack\") was 100 times greater than                for one gram of powder\ncocaine.    U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1, comment.              (n.10, Drug Equivalency\nTables) (Nov. 1, 2006 ed.).\n\n                                      -2-\n\f733, 741 (1st Cir. 1994) (equal protection); United States v.\n\nGraciani, 61 F.3d 70, 76-77 (1st Cir. 1995) (Eighth Amendment),\n\nthis claim would not constitute error, plain or otherwise. For the\n\nsame reason, trial counsel was not constitutionally deficient in\n\nfailing to raise this argument at sentencing, United States v.\n\nHart, 933 F.2d 80, 83 (1st Cir. 1991), as defendant further argues.\n\n            In his pro se brief, defendant further argues that\n\nbecause the guidelines have recently been amended to reduce,\n\nretroactively, the suggested penalties for crack offenses, his\n\nsentence should be vacated and the case remanded to the district\n\ncourt to consider whether to reduce his sentence under the amended\n\nguidelines.      That   argument   is   misdirected.   The   remedy   for\n\ndefendants who believe that they are entitled to a reduction of\n\ntheir sentences under the amended crack guidelines is to file a\n\nmotion with the district court seeking relief under 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3582(c)(2).    United States v. Chandler, 2008 WL 2780632, at * 6\n\n(1st Cir. July 18, 2008).\n\n            Defendant's final claim concerning crack/powder disparity\n\nis that he is entitled to a remand for resentencing in light of\n\nKimbrough v. United States, 128 S. Ct. 558 (2007).           Because his\n\nKimbrough claim was preserved below, a remand on this basis is\n\nwarranted unless there was no Kimbrough error, or the error was\n\nharmless.     United States v. Tabor, 531 F.3d     688,   692 (8th Cir.\n\nJuly 10, 2008).\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\f              There was a Kimbrough error.            When defendant argued for\n\na more lenient sentence based on crack/powder disparity, the\n\ndistrict court stated, \"[T]hat issue has been decided numerous\n\ntimes; even within the context of this specific case that ratio is\n\nappropriate,\" presumably referring to United States v. Pho, 433\n\nF.3d 53 (1st Cir. 2006), and to subsequent decisions reaffirming\n\nPho's      holding   that    a   categorical       rejection    of    the     ratio   is\n\nimpermissible but that the ratio could be considered unfair in\n\nparticular case-specific circumstances.                Id. at 64-65; see also,\n\ne.g., United States v. Fanfan, 468 F.3d 7, 15 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\nThose comments indicate that the court believed that it was not\n\nfree to disregard the crack guideline in a \"mine run\" case.\n\nKimbrough rendered that belief erroneous. Kimbrough, 128 S. Ct. at\n\n575.\n\n               However, the Kimbrough error was harmless because even\n\nif   the    court    had    ignored   the     crack   guidelines       entirely       and\n\nsentenced      defendant     only     for    the    amount     of    powder    cocaine\n\nattributable to him, his base offense level would still have been\n\nthe same.2     In other words, because \"the crack/powder dichotomy is\n\nirrelevant to the . . . sentence actually imposed in this case[,]\n\n. . . the decision in Kimbrough is of only academic interest here.\"\n\n\n       2\n      The same base offense level would have applied if there were\nno crack involved at all, and the only drug involved was 26.05\nkilograms of cocaine. See U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c)(3) (providing that\nLevel 34 applies to \"[a]t least 15 KG but less than 50 KG of\nCocaine\").\n\n                                            -4-\n\fUnited States v. Jimenez, 512 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2007), cert.\n\ndenied, 128 S. Ct. 2920 (2008).\n\nB.   Issues Related to Judicial Fact-Finding\n\n             In   his   counseled    brief,    defendant   argues,   based    on\n\nApprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), and Blakely v.\n\nWashington,       542   U.S.   296   (2004),    that   the    district    court\n\nunconstitutionally enhanced his sentence based on facts found by a\n\njudge by a preponderance of the evidence rather than by a jury\n\nbeyond   a   reasonable    doubt.      As   this   court   explained     shortly\n\nfollowing United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005), \"Booker\n\nreaffirmed the principle of Apprendi . . ., that '[a]ny fact (other\n\nthan a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence\n\nexceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea\n\nof guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or\n\nproved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt,' but did so only\n\ninsofar as the sentence resulted from a mandatory system imposing\n\nbinding requirements on sentencing judges.\"                  United States v.\n\nAntonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 75 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting Booker,\n\n543 U.S. at 244).        As long as the guidelines are applied in an\n\nadvisory manner, as they were here, they \"'fall[] outside the scope\n\nof Apprendi's requirement.'\" Id. at 76 (quoting Booker at 543 U.S.\n\nat 259).      In other words, \"Booker both created and cured the\n\nconstitutional error at the same time.\"             United States v. Pérez-\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fRuiz, 421 F.3d 11, 15 (1st Cir. 2005).         Therefore, defendant's\n\nApprendi-based argument fails.\n\n           To the extent that defendant separately challenges the\n\ncourt's findings on procedural due process grounds, that argument\n\nis insufficiently developed to warrant appellate consideration.\n\nZannino, 895 F.2d at 17.      Moreover, it is belied by the record,\n\nwhich demonstrates that defendant was given ample opportunity to\n\ncontest the findings made in the Presentence Report (\"PSR\"), which\n\nhe did in only a conclusory manner.        In those circumstances, the\n\ncourt was entitled to rely on the PSR.      United States v. Prochner,\n\n417 F.3d 54, 66 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           To the extent that defendant challenges the accuracy of\n\nthe factual findings, our review is only for clear error.          United\n\nStates v. Robinson, 433 F.3d 31, 38 (1st Cir. 2005).         As defendant\n\nconceded below, a sentencing court's determination of drug quantity\n\n\"is not required to be an exact determination but rather only a\n\nreasoned estimate.\"    United States v. Rodriguez, 525 F.3d 85, 107\n\n(1st Cir. 2008). And, in making such determinations, the court was\n\nentitled to rely, in part, on hearsay evidence, including grand\n\njury testimony and information provided by cooperating witnesses.\n\nUnited States v. Riccio, 529 F.3d 40, 47 (1st Cir. 2008) (hearsay\n\nin general);    United States v. Williams, 10 F.3d 910, 914-15 (1st\n\nCir.   1993)   (grand-jury   testimony);   United   States    v.   Jimenez\n\n\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fMartinez, 83 F.3d 488, 493-94 (1st Cir. 1996) (statements of\n\ncooperating witnesses).\n\n          Here, the district court's findings as to drug amounts\n\nwere amply supported by the evidence detailed in the PSR.                  Rather\n\nthan exaggerate the amounts, the PSR's estimates were expressly\n\n\"conservative\" in several respects.           Moreover, any minor error in\n\ncomputing the drug amounts was harmless, since the same base\n\noffense level would have applied even if the total amount was much\n\nless than the 8,810 kilograms estimated by the PSR.                 See U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2D1.1(c)(3) (providing that level 34 applies to the equivalent of\n\nany amount between 3,000 and 10,000 kilograms of marijuana).\n\n          To the extent that defendant challenges the court's\n\napplication of a role enhancement, any such challenge was waived by\n\ndefendant's   abandonment       of   his    prior    objection      to   the   role\n\nenhancement once the probation officer agreed to a three-level,\n\nrather than a four-level, enhancement. United States v. Rodriguez,\n\n311 F.3d 435, 437 (1st Cir. 2002).                  Moreover, a three-level\n\nenhancement   based   on    a    defendant's        role   as   a   \"manager    or\n\nsupervisor\" is appropriate where, as here, \"'there is evidence that\n\na defendant, in committing the crime, exercised control over, or\n\nwas otherwise responsible for overseeing the activities of, at\n\nleast one other person.'\"        United States v. Hilario-Hilario, 529\n\nF.3d 65, 77 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting United States v. Voccola, 99\n\nF.3d 37, 44 (1st Cir. 1996)).\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fC.    Issues Related to Criminal History\n\n               Defendant argues that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion in failing to grant a downward departure under U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 4A1.3(b)(1) or to vary below the guidelines range under 18 U.S.C.\n\n§    3553(a)    on   the   ground    that   his   criminal      history    category\n\nsubstantially        over-represents      the   seriousness     of   his   criminal\n\nhistory.       To the extent that defendant seeks appellate review of\n\nthe district court's denial of a downward departure, such review of\n\nthat discretionary decision is unavailable.                    United States v.\n\nMeléndez-Torres, 420 F.3d 45, 50 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n               Although the district court's refusal to grant a downward\n\nvariance on that ground is reviewable for \"reasonableness,\" such\n\nreview     is    limited     to     the   \"deferential        abuse-of-discretion\n\nstandard.\"       Gall v. United States, 128 S. Ct. 586, 598 (2007).\n\nHere, the district court carefully considered this ground for\n\nvariance and plausibly explained its conclusion that defendant's\n\ncriminal history score did not over-represent his actual criminal\n\nhistory. In particular, the court noted that, although five of the\n\nprior convictions were obtained on the same day, they were the\n\nresult of five separate offenses and that, each time, despite\n\nhaving   been     arrested    and    released     for   the    previous    offense,\n\ndefendant continued to commit the same type of offense again and\n\nagain.     The court also noted that defendant had reentered the\n\ncountry illegally after being deported and that, even after being\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\farrested for the instant offenses, he was arrested in Texas with\n\nlarge sums of money, indicating that he continued to engage in drug\n\ndealing there. That explanation was procedurally and substantively\n\nsufficient, particularly given the fact that the ultimate sentence\n\nwas within the guidelines range.      Rita v. United States, 127 S. Ct.\n\n2456, 2465, 2468 (2007).\n\nD.   Other Issues\n\n             In his pro se brief, defendant challenges his lifetime\n\nterm of supervised release on the ground that it exceeds the\n\nstatutory maximum. In making that argument, defendant relies on 18\n\nU.S.C.   §    3583(b),   the   general    statute   concerning    terms   of\n\nsupervised release.       That reliance is misplaced.            As we have\n\npreviously held, penalties for drug offenses are governed by 21\n\nU.S.C. § 841(b), not by 18 U.S.C. § 3583(b).            United States v.\n\nCortes-Claudio, 312 F.3d 17, 21 (1st Cir. 2002).           And, under 21\n\nU.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A), the maximum supervised release term is life.\n\nId. at 22-23.     Therefore, the district court did not err, plainly\n\nor otherwise, in this regard.\n\n             The two additional arguments that defendant raised in his\n\npro se post-briefing letter under Rule 28(j) of the Federal Rules\n\nof Appellate Procedure3 are deemed waived for failure to raise them\n\n\n     3\n      Those arguments are that five of defendant's prior\nconvictions should be counted as one offense under U.S.S.G.\n§ 4A1.2(a)(2), as construed in light of amendment 709 (effective\nNov. 1, 2007), and that the case should be remanded for\nresentencing on the basis of \"fast-track\" disparity.\n\n                                    -9-\n\fin defendant's counseled or pro se brief. United States v. Coplin,\n\n463 F.3d 96, 102 n.6 (1st Cir. 2006), cert. denied, 127 S. Ct. 1320\n\n(2007).     In any event, those arguments, which were not raised\n\nbelow, were at least forfeited and fail to establish error, plain\n\nor otherwise.\n\n            Accordingly, the district court's judgment is summarily\n\nAFFIRMED.    See 1st Cir. R. 27.0(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                -10-\n\f",

In particular, the court noted that, although five of the\n\nprior convictions were obtained on the same day, they were the\n\nresult of five separate offenses and that, each time, despite\n\nhaving   been     arrested    and    released     for   the    previous    offense,\n\ndefendant continued to commit the same type of offense again and\n\nagain.
