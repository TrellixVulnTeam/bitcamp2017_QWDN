Appellant-petitioner Mariano Maldonado-Pagán\n\nappeals a district court order dismissing his 28 U.S.C. § 2254\n\npetition for failure to exhaust state remedies.       Finding no cause\n\nand prejudice even assuming a procedural default, we affirm.\n\n                                    I\n\n           On March 6, 1992, Maldonado pled guilty to three counts\n\nof first degree murder and grand arson for the killing and burning\n\nof the bodies of his wife and two children.      He was convicted and\n\nsentenced to more than 300 years imprisonment by the Superior Court\n\nof the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Maldonado failed to appeal his\n\nconviction or sentence.\n\n           On April 21, 1997, Maldonado filed a pro se, state habeas\n\ncorpus petition before the Puerto Rico Supreme Court. Although the\n\nSupreme   Court   denied   it   without   comment,   the   petition    was\n\nimproperly presented pursuant to § 1741 of the Puerto Rico Code of\n\nCriminal Procedure, which requires petitioners to file a Rule 192.1\n\nmotion1 in the trial court prior to seeking habeas relief.            P.R.\n\n\n1\n    Rule 192.1 provides, in relevant part:\n\n      Any person who is imprisoned by virtue of a judgment\n      rendered by any Division of the Court of First Instance\n      and who alleges the right to be released because . . .\n      the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution\n      or the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or of the\n      Constitution and laws of the United States, . . . may\n      file a motion, in the part of the court which imposed the\n      sentence, to vacate, set aside, or correct the judgment.\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 34, App. II, R. 192.1 (1963). The Puerto Rico\nSupreme Court describes Rule 192.1 as \"harmoniz[ing] these\n\n                                   -2-\n\fLaws Ann. tit. 34, § 1741(c) (\"No judge shall consider a writ of\n\nhabeas corpus prosecuted by an inmate imprisoned by virtue of a\n\nfinal judgment which has not exhausted the remedy provided by Rule\n\n192.1 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, App. II of this title.\").\n\n          On May 22, 1998, Maldonado filed a pro se Rule 192.1\n\nmotion before the trial court.        The petition was denied, and\n\nMaldonado did not appeal the denial in the commonwealth courts.\n\n          Maldonado subsequently filed a federal § 2254 habeas\n\npetition,2 arguing, as a basis for relief, ineffective assistance\n\nof counsel.   On October 9, 2003, the district court dismissed the\n\nclaim for failure to exhaust state remedies because Maldonado had\n\nnot appealed the trial court's denial of his Rule 192.1 motion.\n\nMaldonado-Pagán v. Malavé, No. 98-2383 (D.P.R. Oct. 9, 2003).\n\n          This appeal follows.        We review a district court's\n\ndismissal of a habeas petition de novo.    See, e.g., Saint Fort v.\n\nAshcroft, 329 F.3d 191, 202 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n\n\nprocedures,\" -- i.e., the     appeal, the motion to set aside a\njudgment, the writ of habeas corpus, and the writ of coram nobis --\nby \"providing a motion through which all the necessary elements of\njudgment may be submitted to the Court, to allow the latter to\ndetermine the validity of the conviction.\"      Pueblo v. González\nPolidura, 18 P.R. Offic. Trans. 939, 953 n.5 (P.R. 1987) (quoting\nthe Senate Judiciary Committee report at 5 Servicio Legislativo de\nP.R. 592-93 (1967)).\n2\n  28 U.S.C. § 2254, states, in relevant part: \"An applicant shall\nnot be deemed to have exhausted the remedies available in the\ncourts of the State, within the meaning of this section, if he has\nthe right under the law of the State to raise, by any available\nprocedure, the question presented.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(c).\n\n                                -3-\n\f                                    II\n\n           Maldonado argues that his claim is procedurally barred in\n\nthe commonwealth court, but should nonetheless be excused for\n\npurposes of exhaustion since he can demonstrate cause for the\n\nprocedural default -- ineffective assistance of counsel -- and\n\nprejudice resulting therefrom.       We are not convinced.\n\n           At the outset, we note, and the government concedes as\n\nmuch, that Maldonado's claim does not appear to be procedurally\n\nbarred and therefore state remedies have not been exhausted.\n\nMaldonado contends that his failure to appeal within thirty days'\n\nnotice of the trial court's denial of his Rule 192.1 motion bars\n\nsubsequent state appeals, thus foreclosing the resolution of his\n\ncase by the commonwealth's highest tribunal. The government argues\n\notherwise, stating that Maldonado may still file a state habeas\n\nappeal, as it is separate from a Rule 192.1 motion.                 See 34\n\nL.P.R.A. §§ 1741-1781. Given that the commonwealth's highest court\n\nhas not had the opportunity to decide Maldonado's habeas claim on\n\nits   merits,    the   government   argues,   his   claim   has   not   been\n\nexhausted.      See García v. Ramírez, 337 F. Supp. 39 (D.P.R. 1971)\n\n(no federal jurisdiction for lack of exhaustion since prisoner\n\nfailed to appeal the trial court's denial of his habeas petition to\n\nthe Puerto Rico Supreme Court).      It is, after all, up to \"the state\n\ncourt to decide whether the petitioner is procedurally barred\n\n. . . .\"   Rodríguez v. Warden, Escuela Indus. De Mujeres, Vega Alta\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fPuerto Rico, 791 F. Supp. 41, 43 (D.P.R. 1992).            The government\n\neven agreed during oral arguments to stipulate that it will not\n\noppose Maldonado's state habeas petition, should he choose to file\n\none, on the grounds that it is procedurally barred.\n\n             In any event, even assuming, favorably to Maldonado, that\n\nfurther state proceedings are procedurally barred, we find it\n\ndifficult to find cause and prejudice from the procedural default.\n\nGenerally, a state court's finding that a \"defendant procedurally\n\ndefaulted a claim bars federal habeas corpus relief on that claim\n\nunless that defendant as a petitioner shows either cause for the\n\ndefault and prejudice from the claimed violation of federal law, or\n\nthat a fundamental miscarriage of justice will result if the claim\n\nis not considered.\"       Gunter v. Maloney, 291 F.3d 74, 78 (1st Cir.\n\n2002) (citing Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 750 (1991))\n\n(emphasis added).     To show \"cause,\" \"the prisoner must show 'that\n\nsome objective factor external to the defense impeded counsel's\n\nefforts to comply with the State's procedural rule.'\"             Id., 291\n\nF.3d at 81 (quoting Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 488 (1986)).\n\nOne such factor is \"ineffective assistance of counsel at a level\n\nwhich violates the Sixth Amendment,\" id. (citing Coleman, 501 U.S.\n\nat   752),   but   that   \"ineffective    assistance   claim   must   itself\n\nordinarily be fairly presented to the state courts and exhausted,\"\n\nid. (citing Edwards v. Carpenter, 529 U.S. 446, 450-54 (2000)).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f          In the instant case, Maldonado cites as \"cause\" the lack\n\nof legal assistance after his conviction and sentencing which\n\nresulted in an alleged procedural default.       However, since it is\n\n\"established that there is no right to counsel in state collateral\n\nproceedings,\" Coleman, 501 U.S. at 755 (citing Pennsylvania v.\n\nFinley, 481 U.S. 551 (1987); Murray v. Giarratano, 492 U.S. 1\n\n(1989)), appellant's lack of counsel could not constitute \"cause\"\n\nto excuse a procedural default.    Id. at 757.\n\n          We also reject Maldonado's claim that a fundamental\n\nmiscarriage of justice would occur if his claim is not considered,\n\non the theory that his lawyer's failure to raise his mental\n\ncondition resulted in a conviction of one who is innocent.        \"To\n\nshow that a fundamental miscarriage of justice would occur in the\n\nhabeas context, 'petitioner must establish actual innocence.'\"\n\nGunter, 291 F.3d at 83 (emphasis added).     This is indeed a narrow\n\nexception, for \"'[w]ithout any new evidence of innocence, even the\n\nexistence of a concededly meritorious constitutional violation is\n\nnot in itself sufficient to establish a miscarriage of justice that\n\nwould allow a habeas court to reach the merits of a barred claim.'\"\n\nBurks v. Dubois, 55 F.3d 712, 718 (1st Cir. 1995) (quoting Schlup\n\nv. Delo, 513 U.S. 298, 316   (1995)).   Here, we find no new credible\n\nevidence that Maldonado is actually innocent of the murders and\n\narson, and take note of the fact that Maldonado was in a general\n\n\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fpopulation facility -- not a mental facility -- during his alleged\n\nprocedural default.\n\n          For   the   reasons   stated,   the   district   court's   order\n\ndismissing Maldonado's habeas corpus petition is affirmed.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f",
