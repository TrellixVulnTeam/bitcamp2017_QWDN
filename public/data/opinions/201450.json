On November 20, 2001, Cape\n\nWind Associates, L.L.C. (\"Cape Wind\") submitted an application to\n\nthe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (\"Corps\") for a navigability\n\npermit under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899\n\n(\"Section 10\"), 33 U.S.C. § 403,1 to construct and operate an\n\noffshore    data   tower    in   an   area   of   Nantucket    Sound   known   as\n\nHorseshoe   Shoals.        Horseshoe    Shoals     is   located   on   the   Outer\n\nContinental Shelf (\"OCS\"), land subject to federal jurisdiction and\n\ncontrol under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (\"OCSLA\"), 43\n\nU.S.C. § 1331.\n\n            The proposed tower was to consist of a platform and a\n\nfixed monopole approximately 170 feet high, supported by three\n\nsteel piles driven into the ocean floor.                Various instrumentation\n\nwas to be attached to the data tower in order to gather data for\n\nuse in determining the feasibility of locating a wind energy plant\n\non Horseshoe Shoals.        A separate permit application for the wind\n\nenergy plant -- a complex originally proposed to include 170 wind\n\nturbines with blade rotors rising 423 feet above mean sea level,\n\noccupying twenty-six square miles of Horseshoe Shoals -- was\n\nsubmitted to the Corps in November 2001.                That application is not\n\nat issue in the instant appeal, and we therefore will not engage in\n\n\n\n\n1\n  Section 10 delegates authority to the Corps to issue permits for\nprojects that impact on the navigability of United States waters.\n33 U.S.C. § 403.\n\n                                       -3-\n\fany analysis of the Corps's authority to permit construction of the\n\nwind energy plant.\n\n          On December 4, 2001, the Corps announced that it was\n\nconsidering Cape Wind's application for the data tower, and invited\n\nthe public to submit comments during a period that included two\n\npublic hearings and ended on May 13, 2002.    On August 19, the Corps\n\nissued a Section 10 permit authorizing Cape Wind to construct and\n\nmaintain the data tower, subject to the imposition of sixteen\n\nspecial conditions, including that Cape Wind remove the data tower\n\nwithin five years, that it post a $300,000 bond for emergency\n\nrepairs or removal, and that it share the data collected with, and\n\npermit the installation of additional data-gathering equipment by,\n\ngovernment agencies, research institutions, and others. Department\n\nof the Army Permit No. 199902477 (Aug. 19, 2002).        The permit was\n\naccompanied by an Environmental Assessment (\"EA\") and Finding of No\n\nSignificant   Impact   (\"FONSI\"),   as   required   by   the   National\n\nEnvironmental Policy Act (\"NEPA\"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 4331-32.\n\n          Appellants subsequently filed an action against the Corps\n\nin the District of Massachusetts, arguing that (1) the Corps lacked\n\nauthority to issue a Section 10 permit for the data tower; (2) the\n\nCorps acted arbitrarily and capriciously, in violation of the\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), by\n\ngranting Cape Wind's permit application in spite of Cape Wind's\n\nlack of property rights on the OCS; and (3) the Corps failed to\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fcomply with NEPA requirements for evaluating the data tower's\n\nenvironmental impacts.            Upon the receipt of cross motions for\n\nsummary judgment, the district court granted summary judgment in\n\nfavor of the Corps and intervenor Cape Wind.                    We review that\n\ndecision de novo,        construing      the   evidence   in    the   light   most\n\nfavorable to appellants.           See Straughn v. Delta Air Lines, Inc.,\n\n250 F.3d 23, 33 (1st Cir. 2001).               We will uphold the grant of\n\nsummary judgment if there is no genuine issue of material fact and\n\nappellees are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.                   Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 56(c).      We affirm the decision of the district court.\n\n                                  I.   Discussion\n\nA.   Corps jurisdiction\n\n            The reach of the Corps's Section 10 permitting authority\n\non   the   OCS   turns   on   a   question     of   statutory   interpretation.\n\nCongress passed OCSLA in 1953 to assert federal jurisdiction over\n\nthe OCS and to establish a regulatory framework for the extraction\n\nof minerals therefrom.        See 43 U.S.C. § 1332; see also Ten Taxpayer\n\nCitizens Group v. Cape Wind Assocs., 373 F.3d 183, 188 (1st Cir.\n\n2004) (\"A major purpose of the OCSLA was to specify that federal\n\nlaw governs on the [OCS] . . . .\") (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).        Accordingly, OCSLA extended the Corps's Section 10\n\nregulatory authority \"to prevent obstruction to navigation in the\n\nnavigable waters of the United States . . . to artificial islands\n\nand fixed structures located on the [OCS].\"               43 U.S.C. § 1333(f)\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\f(1953).   In 1978, this grant of authority was amended to apply\n\ninstead   to    \"the   artificial   islands,    installations,    and   other\n\ndevices referred to in subsection (a) of this section.\"            43 U.S.C.\n\n§   1333(e)    (2004).     Subsection   (a),   in   turn,   extends    federal\n\njurisdiction to:\n\n              all artificial islands, and all installations\n              and other devices permanently or temporarily\n              attached to the seabed, which may be erected\n              thereon for the purpose of exploring for,\n              developing, or producing resources therefrom,\n              or any such installation or other device\n              (other than a ship or vessel) for the purpose\n              of transporting such resources.\n\nId. at § 1333(a)(1) (emphasis supplied). Appellants argue that the\n\nclause \"which may be erected thereon for the purpose of exploring\n\nfor, developing, or producing resources therefrom,\" is restrictive,\n\nand   limits    the    Corps's   permitting    authority    on   the   OCS   to\n\nstructures related to the extraction of mineral resources.2             Thus,\n\nthey argue, the Corps lacked authority to grant a Section 10 permit\n\nfor construction of Cape Wind's data tower.             The Corps, on the\n\nother hand, has determined that its Section 10 authority \"was\n\nextended to artificial islands, installations, and other devices\n\nlocated on the seabed, to the seaward limit of the [OCS], by\n\n\n\n\n2\n     While the term \"resources\" is not defined in OCSLA,\n\"exploration,\" \"development,\" and \"production\" are all defined in\nterms of \"mineral,\" which is in turn defined as \"includ[ing] oil,\ngas, sulphur, geopressured-geothermal and associated resources, and\nall other minerals which are authorized by an Act of Congress to be\nproduced from 'public lands'.\" 43 U.S.C. § 1331(k), (l), (m), (q).\n\n                                     -6-\n\fsection   4(f)   of   [OCSLA]   as   amended.\"    33   C.F.R.   §   320.2(b)\n\n(internal citation omitted).\n\n           The district court determined that the \"which may be\"\n\nclause of Subsection (a) was not restrictive.            See Alliance to\n\nProtect Nantucket Sound, Inc. v. United States Dep't of the Army,\n\n288 F. Supp. 2d 64, 75 (D. Mass. 2003) (finding that OCSLA's text\n\nsupports the Corps's position that Section 10 jurisdiction extends\n\nto all OCS structures \"including, but not limited to, those that\n\n'may be' used to explore for, develop, or produce resources\"\n\n(quoting 43 U.S.C. § 1333(a)(1)) (emphasis supplied by district\n\ncourt)). Thus, the district court held, the Corps has authority to\n\ngrant a Section 10 permit for all structures on the OCS, regardless\n\nof their function.\n\n           We find the statutory text in question ambiguous.           It is\n\nnot apparent whether the reference to Subsection (a) inserted into\n\nSubsection (e) in 1978 refers to \"all artificial islands, and all\n\ninstallations and other devices permanently or temporarily attached\n\nto the seabed,\" 43 U.S.C. § 1333(a)(1), or only to all such\n\ninstallations used to explore, develop or produce resources.              In\n\nlight of this ambiguity, the Corps and Cape Wind invite us to defer\n\nto the Corps's interpretation of its authority, see 33 C.F.R.\n\n§ 320.2(b), under the Chevron doctrine.          See Chevron U.S.A., Inc.\n\nv. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984).             In this\n\ncase, however, we find it unnecessary to reach the question of\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fChevron   deference    because     legislative     history    reveals,    with\n\nexceptional clarity, Congress's intent that Section 10 authority\n\nunder OCSLA not be restricted to structures related to mineral\n\nextraction.3     See   id.    at   843     n.9   (\"If   a   court,   employing\n\ntraditional    tools   of    statutory     construction,     ascertains   that\n\nCongress had an intention on the precise question at issue, that\n\nintention is the law and must be given effect.\"); Strickland v.\n\nComm'r, ME Dept. of Human Servs., 48 F.3d 12, 19-20 (1st Cir. 1995)\n\n(evaluating legislative history to determine whether Congressional\n\nintent was unambiguously expressed).\n\n           In the conference report for the 1978 OSCLA amendments,\n\nCongress explained that the changes to Subsection (e)\n\n           were technical only and there was no intent to\n           change present law. The existing authority of\n           the Corps of Engineers . . . applies to all\n           artificial islands and fixed structures on the\n           [OCS], whether or not they are erected for the\n           purpose of exploring for, developing, removing\n           and transporting resources therefrom.      The\n\n\n3\n  Appellants' argument that the district court erred by elevating\nthe importance of legislative history to supercede that of the\nplain language of OCSLA is without merit in this case. Even were\nthe text less ambiguous, a reviewing court may consider legislative\nhistory to determine \"whether there is clearly expressed\nlegislative intention contrary to [the statutory] language, which\nwould require [the court] to question the strong presumption that\nCongress expresses its intent through the language it chooses.\"\nINS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 432 n.12 (1987)(internal\nquotation marks omitted); see also Train v. Colorado Public\nInterest Research Group, Inc., 426 U.S. 1, 10 (1976) (\"When aid to\nconstruction of the meaning of words, as used in the statute, is\navailable, there certainly can be no 'rule of law' which forbids\nits use, however clear the words may appear on 'superficial\nexamination.'\").\n\n                                     -8-\n\f          amendment . . . is not intended to change the\n          scope of this authority, but merely to conform\n          the description of the types of structures, no\n          matter what their purpose, to the types of\n          structures listed in subsection (a), namely\n          all    installations    and   other    devices\n          permanently or temporarily attached to the\n          seabed.    It is not the intention of the\n          conferees to limit the authority of the Corps\n          [] as to structures used for the exploration,\n          development, removal, and transportation of\n          resources.\n\nH.R. Conf. Rep. No. 95-1474 (\"Conference Report\") at 82 (1978),\n\nreprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1674, 1681 (emphasis supplied).4\n\nAppellants suggest that the intent expressed in the above-quoted\n\nlanguage was not that Corps authority be unlimited with regard to\n\nthe purpose of the structure in question, but rather with regard to\n\n\n4\n    The need to bring the types of structures referred to in\nSubsection (e) into agreement with those referred to in Subsection\n(a) becomes apparent when one considers the amendments made to the\nlatter in 1978.    The original text of Subsection (a) extended\nfederal jurisdiction over \"all artificial islands and fixed\nstructures which may be erected thereon for the purpose of\nexploring for, developing, removing, and transporting resources\ntherefrom.\"   43 U.S.C. § 1333(a) (1953) (emphasis supplied).\nBecause of the development of relatively impermanent structures,\nwhich did not clearly fall within the \"fixed structures\" rubric,\nCongress amended Subsection (a) in 1978 to apply instead to \"all\nartificial islands and all installations and other devices\npermanently or temporarily attached to the seabed, which may be\nerected thereon for the purpose of exploring for, developing, or\nproducing resources therefrom.\" See H.R. Rep. No. 95-590, at 128\n(1977), reprinted in     1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1450, 1534 (emphasis\nsupplied) (explaining that change in Subsection (a) was made\nbecause \"the Committee intends that federal law is . . . to be\napplicable to all activities on drilling ships, semi-submersible\ndrilling rigs, and other watercraft, when they are attached to the\nseabed\"). The reference to \"fixed structures\" in the predecessor\nof the current Subsection (e), 43 U.S.C. § 1333(f) (1953), was\naccordingly revised to refer instead to those structures \"referred\nto in subsection (a),\" 43 U.S.C. § 1333(e) (2005).\n\n                               -9-\n\fdifferent types of structures within the subset of structures\n\nrelated to exploring for, developing, removing or transporting\n\nminerals.    This   interpretation     strains    the   Conference     Report\n\nlanguage well beyond the meaning it can bear, especially in light\n\nof Congress's awareness when it amended OCSLA that the Corps had\n\nissued Section 10 permits for OCS structures unrelated to mineral\n\nextraction on several occasions between 1953 and 1978, implying its\n\napproval of the exercise of such jurisdiction.               See Conference\n\nReport at 81 (\"[The Corps's existing] authority has been used . . .\n\nto regulate the construction and location of . . . artificial\n\nfishing reefs, radio towers, and a proposed gambling casino which\n\nwas to be constructed on reefs.            It also applies to structures\n\nerected for the purpose of exploring for and transporting resources\n\n. . . .\" (emphasis supplied)). Appellants' efforts to counter this\n\nlegislative history with language from the Senate Report from the\n\noriginal 1953 OCSLA that could be read to imply a limitation of\n\nCorps permitting authority to structures intended for mineral\n\nresource development is unavailing.         The Corps's current authority\n\nis determined by OCSLA as amended in 1978, and the Conference\n\nReport addresses Congress's intent at that time.            See also   United\n\nStates v. Commonwealth Energy Sys. & Subsidiary Cos., 235 F.3d 11,\n\n16   (1st   Cir.    2000)   (\"The    most     dispositive     indicator   of\n\ncongressional intent is the conference report.\").\n\n\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\f          Congress made clear that \"[t]he existing authority of the\n\nCorps . . . applies to all artificial islands and fixed structures\n\non the [OCS], whether or not they are erected for the purpose of\n\nexploring for, developing, removing, and transporting resources\n\ntherefrom.\"     Conference Report at 82.       This express legislative\n\nintent is determinative of the scope of the Corps's authority.\n\nAccordingly, we hold that the Corps had jurisdiction to issue a\n\nSection 10 permit for Cape Wind's data tower.\n\nB.   Property interest\n\n           Appellants    argue   that   the   Corps   failed   to   properly\n\nconsider Cape Wind's lack of a property interest in the OCS land on\n\nwhich it sought to build the data tower when it granted the Section\n\n10 permit.\n\n           1.   Agency regulations\n\n           Appellants first argue that the Corps has a regulation,\n\n33 C.F.R. § 325.1(d)(7), that requires that the applicant actually\n\nhave necessary property rights in the area of the project and make\n\nan affirmation to that effect.            The regulation states:        \"The\n\napplication must be signed by the person who desires to undertake\n\nthe proposed activity . . . .     The signature of the applicant . . .\n\nwill be an affirmation that the applicant possesses or will possess\n\nthe requisite property interest to undertake the activity proposed\n\nin the application . . . .\"       Id.     Of course, the regulation does\n\nnot say that the applicant must actually possess, or possess in the\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\ffuture, the requisite property rights, but only that the applicant\n\nmust make an affirmation to that effect.\n\n          The Corps responds to appellants' argument by referring\n\nto another of its regulations, which provides that:\n\n          A [Corps] permit does not convey any property\n          rights . . . or any exclusive privileges.\n          Furthermore   a  [Corps]   permit  does   not\n          authorize any injury to property or invasion\n          of rights or any infringement of Federal,\n          state or local laws or regulations.       The\n          applicant's signature on an application is an\n          affirmation that the applicant possesses or\n          will possess the requisite property interest\n          to undertake the activity proposed in the\n          application. The [Corps] will not enter into\n          disputes but will remind the applicant of the\n          above.   The dispute over property ownership\n          will not be a factor in the Corps public\n          interest decision.\n\n33 C.F.R. § 320.4(g)(6) (emphasis supplied); see also Environmental\n\nAssessment   and   Statement   of   Findings    at    13    (Aug.   19,   2002)\n\n(paraphrasing § 320.4(g)(6) in response to comments about Cape\n\nWind's lack of property interest).\n\n          The Corps indicated in its response to comments about\n\nCape Wind's lack of a property interest, and articulated more fully\n\nduring the course of this litigation, that it deems § 320.4(g)(6)\n\nto require only that it remind applicants of their need to possess\n\nall requisite property interests.          In the Corps's view, § 320.4\n\n(g)(6)'s requirement that a \"dispute over property ownership will\n\nnot be a factor in the Corps public interest decision\" applies to\n\npreclude consideration    of   a    dispute    over   the    adequacy     of   an\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fapplicant's     property   interests      in   the   project      site.    See\n\nEnvironmental Assessment at 14.\n\n           Appellants argued before the district court that the\n\nrequirement that applicants affirm possession of the requisite\n\nproperty interests for the proposed activity, 33 C.F.R. § 320.4\n\n(g)(6), means that such property interests must, in fact, be\n\npossessed by the applicant.        Because Cape Wind had no property\n\ninterest in the proposed data tower site, nor could it obtain such\n\nan interest under current law, its Section 10 permit application\n\nought to have been denied.          The district court rejected this\n\nargument, deferring instead to the Corps's interpretation that\n\n§ 320.4(g)(6) requires only an affirmation from the applicant,\n\nwhich Cape Wind provided. According to the district court, § 320.4\n\n(g)(6),   as   interpreted   by   the    Corps,   fit   in   as   \"part   of   a\n\n[regulatory] scheme designed to keep the Corps out of property\n\ndisputes.\"     Alliance, 288 F. Supp. 2d at 77.      Accordingly, not only\n\ndid the regulation relieve the Corps of any obligation to consider\n\nthe sufficiency of Cape Wind's property interests, but it precluded\n\nsuch consideration altogether.          Id. at 77-78.\n\n           The face of § 320.4(g)(6) evidences the Corps's intent\n\nnot to be involved in private property disputes.                    And as to\n\ndisputes over public land, § 320.4(g)(6), by its own terms, says\n\nthat a permit does not \"convey any property rights . . . or any\n\nexclusive privileges.\"       Thus, the regulation does not purport to\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\faddress disputes over public property, but rather attempts to\n\ninsulate the Corps from addressing those disputes.              Appellants'\n\nargument that the regulations impose an obligation on the Corps in\n\na Section 10 case to resolve disputes over the ownership of public\n\n(or private) property is simply wrong.\n\n            Even if the regulation did not clearly support the\n\nCorps's interpretation on its face, the Corps's interpretation\n\nwould nonetheless be entitled to deference.            See Thomas Jefferson\n\nUniv. v. Shalala, 512 U.S. 504, 512 (1994) (holding that agency's\n\ninterpretation     during    administrative    adjudication     of   its   own\n\nregulations \"must be given controlling weight unless it is plainly\n\nerroneous or inconsistent with the regulation\") (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted); South Shore Hosp., Inc. v. Thompson, 308 F.3d 91,\n\n98   (1st   Cir.   2002)    (deference   appropriate    where   language   of\n\nregulations \"admits of differing interpretations, and the [agency]\n\nchooses reasonably among them\").           Deference would be appropriate\n\neven though the interpretation was offered in a less formal session\n\nthan the interpretation in Thomas Jefferson.           See Auer v. Robbins,\n\n519 U.S. 452, 462 (1997) (deferring to agency interpretation\n\ncontained in amicus brief submitted in dispute between private\n\nparties); see also Christensen v. Harris County, 529 U.S. 576, 588\n\n(2000) (limiting Auer deference to ambiguous regulations); United\n\nStates v. Hoyts Cinemas Corp., 380 F.3d 558, 567 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(affording \"some weight\" to Justice Department's interpretation of\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\fits regulation \"even though the Department's gloss is offered only\n\nin a brief rather than in some more formal manner\").5\n\n             We find that the Corps's reading of § 320.4(g)(6) is a\n\nreasonable    one:     the    regulation's      text   states   first    that   an\n\napplicant    must    affirm    possession       of   the   requisite    property\n\ninterests, then that the Corps \"will not enter into disputes but\n\nwill remind the applicant of the above\" -- that is, the Corps will\n\nremind the applicant of its need to possess the requisite property\n\ninterest.     The regulation next states that \"[t]he dispute over\n\nproperty ownership will not be a factor in the Corps public\n\ninterest decision.\"      \"The dispute\" refers back to the category of\n\ndisputes that result in a reminder of the need to obtain all\n\nrequired property interests. It is reasonable, in this context, to\n\ndetermine that \"the dispute over property ownership\" into which the\n\nCorps may not enter includes a dispute over whether the applicant\n\nhas acquired all requisite property interests -- that is, a dispute\n\nover   the   sufficiency      of   the    applicant's      property    interests.\n\nFurther, the goal of preventing the Corps from expending its\n\n\n\n5\n  While deference is not due to interpretations that are \"post hoc\nrationalizations offered by an agency seeking to defend past agency\naction against attack,\" Auer, 519 U.S. at 462, or to\ninterpretations that have varied erratically over time, see South\nShore, 308 F.3d at 102, we find neither of these stumbling blocks\nin the instant case.      The Corps's interpretation was issued\nsimultaneously with the permit, and so does not appear to be a post\nhoc rationalization. Further, the Corps has consistently taken the\nposition that nothing in Section 10 requires it to resolve property\ndisputes.\n\n                                         -15-\n\fresources on evaluating the legal question of the sufficiency of\n\nproperty interests is a reasonable one.         This is so whether the\n\ndispute is over the sufficiency of the applicant's interests as\n\nopposed to those of other private property holders in the area, or\n\nas opposed to those of the federal government, especially since the\n\nCorps is permitted to consider the potential impact of the project\n\non others' property interests during its public interest review.\n\nSee 33 C.F.R. § 320.4(a)(1) (listing \"considerations of property\n\nownership\" as factor to consider in determining whether, and under\n\nwhat conditions, to grant permit).        Accordingly, we find that the\n\ndistrict   court   did   not   err   in    deferring   to   the   Corps's\n\ninterpretation of its regulations and its decision not to evaluate\n\nthe sufficiency of Cape Wind's property interests in the OCS.\n\n           2.   Public interest review\n\n           Appellants also argue that the Corps's duty to act in the\n\npublic interest required it to consider the effect that granting\n\nCape Wind's application would have on the federal government's\n\ninterest in the OCS.     The Corps is not shielded from this line of\n\nattack by its reliance on § 320.4(g)(6). Appellants properly point\n\nout that the Corps must consider, despite § 320.4(g)(6), the impact\n\nof a permit issuance on federal property rights in various ways, as\n\npart of its general public interest review.       See 33 C.F.R. § 320.4\n\n(a)(1) (impact of project on \"considerations of property ownership\"\n\nmust be a factor in the Corps's analysis); United States v. Alaska,\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\f503 U.S. 569, 590-91 (1992) (§ 320.4(g)(6) does not prohibit Corps\n\nfrom considering effect of proposed port construction on federal-\n\nstate boundary in submerged waters, under 33 C.F.R. § 320.4(f)).\n\nHere, as we explain below, the Corps reasonably found that the data\n\ntower's impact on federal property rights would be \"negligible,\"\n\nEnvironmental Assessment at 4, and thus appellants' public interest\n\nargument fails.\n\n             3.   Reliance on Cape Wind's affirmation\n\n             Finally, appellants argue that Cape Wind's affirmation\n\nthat it possessed the requisite property interests was obviously\n\nfalse, as there exists no mechanism by which private entities can\n\nobtain a license to construct a data tower on the federally\n\ncontrolled OCS.       The Corps's grant of a Section 10 permit on the\n\nbasis   of   this    false   affirmation      was   therefore   arbitrary   and\n\ncapricious, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5\n\nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A).      Again, this line of attack is not deflected by\n\nreference to Corps regulations.               Appellants note that agency\n\ndecisions based on false factual information run afoul of the\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act.          See, e.g., Missouri Serv. Comm'n v.\n\nFERC, 337 F.3d 1066, 1075 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (\"Reliance on facts that\n\nan agency knows are false at the time it relies on them is the\n\nessence      of     arbitrary    and     capricious      decisionmaking.\").6\n\n\n6\n  Indeed, at oral argument, the Corps's attorney stated that if an\napplicant sought a permit to build a structure for extraction\npurposes under OCSLA and affirmed possession of all requisite\n\n                                       -17-\n\fAppellants'   argument   hinges     on     the   veracity   of    Cape   Wind's\n\naffirmation, which in turn depends, appellants argue, on whether\n\nauthorization in addition to a Section 10 permit is necessary for\n\nconstruction of the data tower.7           The first part of our opinion\n\nholds that a Section 10 permit is necessary for all structures on\n\nthe OCS unless otherwise indicated by law, but does not determine\n\nwhether such a permit is sufficient to authorize building on the\n\nfederally controlled OCS.\n\n          Whether,   and    under     what       circumstances,    additional\n\nauthorization is necessary before a developer infringes on the\n\nfederal government's rights in the OCS is a thorny issue, one that\n\nis unnecessary to delve into in the instant case.            The data tower\n\nat issue here involves no real infringement on federal interests in\n\nthe OCS lands.    To start, the structure is temporary, of five\n\n\nproperty interests, but was refused a lease by the Department of\nthe Interior, then the Corps would consider the lack of an Interior\nlease and would deny the permit.\n7\n  Congress has established regulatory schemes for certain types of\nstructures on the OCS. OCSLA itself sets up a system of oil and\ngas leases that require both a lease from the Secretary of the\nInterior as well as a Corps permit. See 43 U.S.C. § 1331 et seq.\nThe Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion Act of 1980, 42 U.S.C. § 9101\net seq., authorizes the creation of large thermal energy plants by\nrequiring a license from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration, while the Coast Guard is authorized to make rules\nensuring safety of navigation. Id. §§ 9111, 9118. The Deepwater\nPorts Act of 1975, 33 U.S.C. § 1501 et seq., requires a license\nfrom the Secretary of Transportation in order to authorize\nconstruction of deepwater ports. Id. § 1503. The National Fishing\nEnhancement Act of 1984, 33 U.S.C. § 2101 et seq., in contrast,\ndoes not require approval for artificial reefs placed on the OCS\nbeyond a Section 10 permit. Id. § 2104.\n\n                                    -18-\n\fyears' duration, more than two of which have now passed.        The tower\n\nis also not exclusive -- it must accept data collection devices\n\nform the government and others, and it must give the data to the\n\ngovernment.    The tower is a single structure, and it provides\n\nvaluable information that the Corps requires in order to evaluate\n\nthe larger wind energy plant proposal. The Corps's public interest\n\nevaluation of the data tower resulted in a finding of \"negligible\n\nimpact\" on property ownership and stated that collection of the\n\ndata is in the public interest.    Environmental Assessment at 4-5.\n\nIt is inconceivable to us that permission to erect a single,\n\ntemporary scientific device, like this, which gives the federal\n\ngovernment information it requires, could be an infringement on any\n\nfederal property ownership interest in the OCS.\n\n          Thus, the question of infringement of federal property\n\ninterests is entirely hypothetical in this case.         As a result,\n\nappellants' arguments based both on the arbitrary and capricious\n\nprovision in the APA and the public interest standards discussed in\n\nAlaska   are   misplaced.   We    do    not   here   evaluate    whether\n\ncongressional authorization is necessary for construction of Cape\n\nWind's proposed wind energy plant, a structure vastly larger in\n\nscale, complexity, and duration, which is not at issue in the\n\npresent action.    Our analysis is limited to whether additional\n\nCongressional authorization is necessary for the data tower, which\n\n\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\fdoes not infringe on any federal property interest, and we conclude\n\nthat it is not.\n\nC.   National Environmental Policy Act\n\n           The     Council      on   Environmental         Quality     (\"CEQ\")   is\n\nauthorized    to     enact    regulations    to    ensure    federal     agencies'\n\ncompliance with NEPA.          See 42 U.S.C. §§ 4342, 4344.             Appellants\n\nargue that     the    Corps    violated   CEQ     regulations     by   failing   to\n\ncirculate for public comment a draft EA and FONSI.                     We evaluate\n\nagency action to determine if it is \"arbitrary, capricious, an\n\nabuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\"                    5\n\nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C).\n\n             CEQ regulations require that an \"agency shall involve\n\n. . . the public, to the extent practicable, in preparing [an EA],\"\n\n40 C.F.R. § 1501.4(b), and that \"[a]gencies shall . . . make\n\ndiligent     efforts    to     involve    the     public     in   preparing      and\n\nimplementing their NEPA procedures[,] . . . provide public notice\n\nof . . . the availability of environmental documents so as to\n\ninform those persons . . . who may be interested or affected,\" and\n\n\"[s]olicit appropriate information from the public,\" Id. § 1506.6.\n\nAppellants inform us that the Ninth Circuit has held that, under\n\nthese regulations, \"[t]he public must be given an opportunity to\n\ncomment on draft EAs.\"        See Citizens for Better Forestry v. United\n\nStates Dep't of Agric., 341 F.3d 961, 970 (9th Cir. 2003) (quoting\n\nAnderson v. Evans, 314 F.3d 1006, 1016 (9th Cir. 2002), opinion\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\famended and reissued without change to this section, 371 F.3d 475\n\n(9th Cir. 2004)).      Appellees reject this interpretation, citing\n\ncontrary precedent from a number of other circuits and noting that\n\nthe quoted language in Citizens for Better Forestry was dicta.\n\nAppellees argue that the Corps met the requirement of involving the\n\npublic \"to the extent practicable\" in preparing the EA by issuing\n\npublic notice of Cape Wind's application, providing a comment\n\nperiod that they later extended to over five months, carrying out\n\ntwo public hearings, noting and responding to public comments in\n\nthe   EA,   and   conferring   with    federal    and   state   environmental\n\nagencies.     We agree.    Nothing in the CEQ regulations requires\n\ncirculation of a draft EA for public comment, except under certain\n\n\"limited circumstances.\" 40 C.F.R. § 1501.4(e)(2).\n\n            Appellants argue that one of those circumstances8 applies\n\nto this case:      A draft FONSI must be made available for public\n\ncomment when \"[t]he nature of the proposed action is one without\n\nprecedent.\" Id. § 1501.4(e)(2)(ii). Appellants argue that the data\n\ntower proposal is \"without precedent\" because Nantucket Sound is a\n\npristine, undeveloped area and because \"there is no precedent for\n\npermitting a privately-owned structure for wind energy, or even\n\nrelated research, on OCS lands.\"             The Corps, however, determined\n\n\n\n8\n   The other circumstance, when \"[t]he proposed action is, or is\nclosely similar to, one which normally requires the preparation of\nan environmental impact statement,\" § 1501.4(e)(2)(i), has not been\nargued to apply in this case.\n\n                                      -21-\n\fthat   \"[t]here   is   precedent   for    this   type    of   structure   in\n\nMassachusetts's waters,\" in the form of a data tower in Martha's\n\nVineyard.    Environmental Assessment at 10.            The district court\n\nagreed, relying on the Corps's findings that while \"[t]here are no\n\nother similar structures or devices in Horseshoe Shoals,\" a data\n\ntower was permitted in state waters off Martha's Vineyard, and Cape\n\nWind's data tower was \"not inconsistent with other pile supported\n\nstructures in the marine environment in Nantucket Sound.\" Id. at 2;\n\nsee Alliance, 288 F. Supp. 2d at 78-79.\n\n            We find that the Corps's determination that the data\n\ntower is not without precedent, on the basis of physically similar\n\nstructures in nearby waters, was reasonable.        We do not agree with\n\nappellants' argument that construction of structures like the data\n\ntower on the OCS without additional authorization from Congress is\n\nwithout precedent, but even if that were so, it would suggest only\n\nthat issuance of the permit is legally unprecedented.              The CEQ\n\nregulations, however, are designed to address environmental impact.\n\nBased on the Corps's findings about the existence of similar pile-\n\ndriven structures in Martha's Vineyard and near the shore of\n\nNantucket Sound, we can see nothing unprecedented about the way\n\nthis data tower will impact the environment.9           Thus, we find that\n\nthe Corps fully complied with its obligations under NEPA and CEQ\n\n\n9\n   To the extent that appellants' arguments are concerned with\nunprecedented impact of the proposed wind energy plant, that\nproject is not at issue in the current action.\n\n                                   -22-\n\fregulations to engage with the public in preparing the EA and\n\nFONSI.\n\n                           II.    Conclusion\n\n          For   the   reasons    stated   above,   the   judgment   of   the\n\ndistrict court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -23-\n\f",

(\"Cape Wind\") submitted an application to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (\"Corps\") for a navigability permit under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (\"Section 10\"), 33 U.S.C. &#167; 403,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> to construct and operate an offshore data tower in an area of Nantucket Sound known as Horseshoe Shoals. Horseshoe Shoals is located on the Outer Continental Shelf (\"OCS\"), land subject to federal jurisdiction and control under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (\"OCSLA\"), 43 U.S.C. &#167; 1331.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The proposed tower was to consist of a platform and a fixed monopole approximately 170 feet high, supported by three steel piles driven into the ocean floor. Various instrumentation was to be attached to the data tower in order to gather data for use in determining the feasibility of locating a wind energy plant on Horseshoe Shoals. A separate permit application for the wind energy plant &#8212; a complex originally proposed to include 170 wind turbines with blade rotors rising 423 feet above mean sea level, occupying twenty-six square miles of Horseshoe Shoals &#8212; was submitted to the Corps in November 2001. That application is not at issue in the instant appeal, and we therefore will not engage in any analysis of the Corps's authority to permit construction of the wind energy plant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 4, 2001, the Corps announced that it was considering Cape Wind's application for the data tower, and invited the public to submit comments during a period that included two public hearings and ended on May 13, 2002. On August 19, the Corps issued a Section 10 permit authorizing Cape Wind to construct and maintain the data tower, subject to the imposition of sixteen special conditions, including that Cape Wind remove the data tower within five years, that it post a $300,000 bond for emergency repairs or removal, and that it share the data collected with, and permit the installation of additional data-gathering equipment by, government agencies, research institutions, and others. Department of the Army Permit No. 199902477 (Aug. 19, 2002). The permit was accompanied by an Environmental Assessment (\"EA\") and Finding of No Significant Impact (\"FONSI\"), as required by the National Environmental Policy Act (\"NEPA\"), 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 4331-32.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants subsequently filed an action against the Corps in the District of Massachusetts, arguing that (1) the Corps lacked authority to issue a Section 10 permit for the data tower; (2) the Corps acted arbitrarily and capriciously, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), 5 U.S.C. &#167; 706(2)(A), by granting Cape Wind's permit application in spite of Cape Wind's lack of property rights on the OCS; and (3) the Corps failed to comply with NEPA requirements for evaluating the data tower's environmental impacts. Upon the receipt of cross motions for summary judgment, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the Corps and intervenor Cape Wind. We review that decision <i>de novo,</i> construing the evidence in the light most favorable to appellants. <i>See Straughn v. Delta Air Lines, Inc.,</i> 250 F.3d 23, 33 (1st Cir.2001).

Congress passed OCSLA in 1953 to assert federal jurisdiction over the OCS and to establish a regulatory framework for the extraction of minerals therefrom. <i>See</i> 43 U.S.C. &#167; 1332; <i>see also Ten Taxpayer Citizens Group v.

Subsection (a), in turn, extends federal jurisdiction to:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>all</i> artificial islands, and <i>all</i> installations and other devices permanently or temporarily attached to the seabed, <i>which may be erected thereon for the purpose of exploring for, developing, or producing resources therefrom,</i> or any such installation or other device (other than a ship or vessel) for the purpose of transporting such resources.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at &#167; 1333(a)(1) (emphasis supplied).

The Corps, on the other hand, has determined that its Section 10 authority \"was extended to artificial islands, installations, and other devices located on the seabed, to the seaward limit of the [OCS], by section 4(f) of [OCSLA] as amended.\" 33 C.F.R. &#167; 320.2(b) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court determined that the \"which may be\" clause of Subsection (a) was not restrictive. <i>See Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, Inc. v. United States Dep't of the Army,</i> 288 F.Supp.2d 64, 75 (D.Mass.2003) (finding that OCSLA's text supports the Corps's position that Section 10 jurisdiction extends to all OCS structures \"including, but not limited to, those that `<i>may be</i>' used to explore for, develop, or produce resources\" (quoting 43 U.S.C. &#167; 1333(a)(1)) (emphasis supplied by district court)). Thus, the district court held, the Corps has authority to grant a Section 10 permit for all structures on the OCS, regardless of their function.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find the statutory text in question ambiguous. It is not apparent whether the reference to Subsection (a) inserted into Subsection (e) in 1978 refers to \"all artificial islands, and all installations and other devices permanently or temporarily attached to the seabed,\" 43 U.S.C. &#167; 1333(a)(1), or only to all such installations used to explore, develop or produce resources. In light of this ambiguity, the Corps and Cape Wind invite us to defer to the Corps's interpretation of its authority, <i>see</i> 33 C.F.R. &#167; 320.2(b), under the <i>Chevron</i> doctrine. <i>See Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc.,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). In this case, however, we find it unnecessary to reach the question of <i>Chevron</i> deference because legislative history reveals, with exceptional clarity, Congress's intent that Section 10 authority under OCSLA not be restricted to structures related to mineral extraction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>See id.</i> at 843 n. 9, 104 S.Ct. 2778 (\"If a court, employing traditional tools of statutory construction, ascertains that Congress had an intention on the precise question at issue, that intention is the law and must be given effect.\"); <i>Strickland v.

This interpretation strains the Conference Report language well beyond the meaning it can bear, especially in light of Congress's awareness when it amended OCSLA that the Corps had issued Section 10 permits for OCS structures unrelated to mineral extraction on several occasions between 1953 and 1978, implying its approval of the exercise of such jurisdiction. <i>See</i> Conference Report at 81 (\"[The Corps's existing] authority has been used... to regulate the construction and location of ... artificial fishing reefs, radio towers, and a proposed gambling casino which was to be constructed on reefs.

Appellants' efforts to counter this legislative history with language from the Senate Report from the original 1953 OCSLA that could be read to imply a limitation of Corps permitting authority to structures intended for mineral resource development is unavailing. The Corps's current authority is determined by OCSLA as amended in 1978, and the Conference Report addresses Congress's intent at that time. <i>See also United States v.

The regulation states: \"The application must be signed by the person who desires to undertake the proposed activity.... The signature of the applicant ... will be an affirmation that the applicant possesses or will possess the requisite property interest to undertake the activity proposed in the application....\" <i>Id.</i> Of course, the regulation does not say that the applicant must actually possess, or possess in the future, the requisite property rights, but only that the applicant must make an affirmation to that effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Corps responds to appellants' argument by referring to another of its regulations, which provides that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>A [Corps] permit does not convey any property rights ... or any exclusive privileges.

The applicant's signature on an application is an affirmation that the applicant possesses or will possess the requisite property interest to undertake the activity proposed in the application. The [Corps] will not enter into disputes but will remind the applicant of the above. <i>The dispute over property ownership will not be a factor in the Corps public interest decision.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">33 C.F.R. &#167; 320.4(g)(6) (emphasis supplied); <i>see also</i> Environmental Assessment and Statement of Findings at 13 (Aug. 19, 2002) (paraphrasing &#167; 320.4(g)(6) in response to comments about Cape Wind's lack of property interest).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Corps indicated in its response to comments about Cape Wind's lack of a property interest, and articulated more fully during the course of this litigation, that it deems &#167; 320.4(g)(6) to require only that it remind applicants of their need to possess all requisite property interests. In the Corps's view, &#167; 320.4(g)(6)'s requirement that a \"dispute over property ownership will not be a factor in the Corps public interest decision\" applies to preclude consideration of a dispute over the adequacy of an applicant's property interests in the project site. <i>See</i> Environmental Assessment at 14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants argued before the district court that the requirement that applicants affirm possession of the requisite property interests for the proposed activity, 33 C.F.R. &#167; 320.4(g)(6), means that such property interests must, in fact, be possessed by the applicant. Because Cape Wind had no property interest in the proposed data tower site, nor could it obtain such an interest under current law, its Section 10 permit application ought to have been denied. The district court rejected this argument, deferring instead to the Corps's interpretation that &#167; 320.4(g)(6) requires only an affirmation from the applicant, which Cape Wind provided. According to the district court, &#167; 320.4(g)(6), as interpreted by the Corps, fit in as \"part of a [regulatory] scheme designed to keep the Corps out of property disputes.\" <i>Alliance,</i> 288 F.Supp.2d at 77. Accordingly, not only did the regulation relieve the Corps of any obligation to consider the sufficiency of Cape Wind's property interests, but it precluded such consideration altogether. <i>Id.</i> at 77-78.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The face of &#167; 320.4(g)(6) evidences the Corps's intent not to be involved in private property disputes. And as to disputes over public land, &#167; 320.4(g)(6), by its own terms, says that a permit does not \"convey any property rights... or any exclusive privileges.\" Thus, the regulation does not purport to address disputes over public property, but rather attempts to insulate the Corps from addressing those disputes. Appellants' argument that the regulations impose an obligation on the Corps in a Section 10 case to resolve disputes over the ownership of public (or private) property is simply wrong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the regulation did not clearly support the Corps's interpretation on its face, the Corps's interpretation would nonetheless be entitled to deference. <i>See Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala,</i> 512 U.S. 504, 512, 114 S.Ct. 2381, 129 L.Ed.2d 405 (1994) (holding that agency's interpretation during administrative adjudication of its own regulations \"must be given controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation\") (internal quotation marks omitted); <i>South Shore Hosp., Inc. v. Thompson,</i> 308 F.3d 91, 98 (1st Cir.2002) (deference appropriate where language of regulations \"admits of differing interpretations, and the [agency] chooses reasonably among them\"). Deference would be appropriate even though the interpretation was offered in a less formal session than the interpretation in <i>Thomas Jefferson. See Auer v. Robbins,</i> 519 U.S. 452, 462, 117 S.Ct. 905, 137 L.Ed.2d 79 (1997) (deferring to agency interpretation contained in amicus brief submitted in dispute between private parties); <i>see also Christensen v.

The regulation next states that \"[t]he dispute over property ownership will not be a factor in the Corps public interest decision.\" \"The dispute\" refers back to the category of disputes that result in a reminder of the need to obtain all required property interests. It is reasonable, in this context, to determine that \"the dispute over property ownership\" into which the Corps may not enter includes a dispute over whether the applicant has acquired all requisite property interests &#8212; that is, a dispute over the sufficiency of the applicant's property interests. Further, the goal of preventing the Corps from expending its resources on evaluating the legal question of the sufficiency of property interests is a reasonable one. This is so whether the dispute is over the sufficiency of the applicant's interests as opposed to those of other private property holders in the area, or as opposed to those of the federal government, especially since the Corps is permitted to consider the potential <i>impact</i> of the project on others' property interests during its public interest review. <i>See</i> 33 C.F.R. &#167; 320.4(a)(1) (listing \"considerations of property ownership\" as factor to consider in determining whether, and under what conditions, to grant permit). Accordingly, we find that the district court did not err in deferring to the Corps's interpretation of its regulations and its decision not to evaluate the sufficiency of Cape Wind's property interests in the OCS.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Public interest review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants also argue that the Corps's duty to act in the public interest required it to consider the effect that granting Cape Wind's application would have on the federal government's interest in the OCS. The Corps is not shielded from this line of attack by its reliance on &#167; 320.4(g)(6). Appellants properly point out that the Corps must consider, despite &#167; 320.4(g)(6), the impact of a permit issuance on federal property rights in various ways, as part of its general public interest review. <i>See</i> 33 C.F.R. &#167; 320.4(a)(1) (impact of project on \"considerations of property ownership\" must be a factor in the Corps's analysis); <i>United States v. Alaska,</i> 503 U.S. 569, 590-91, 112 S.Ct. 1606, 118 L.Ed.2d 222 (1992) (&#167; 320.4(g)(6) does not prohibit Corps from considering effect of proposed port construction on federal-state boundary in submerged waters, under 33 C.F.R. &#167; 320.4(f)). Here, as we explain below, the Corps reasonably found that the data tower's impact on federal property rights would be \"negligible,\" Environmental Assessment at 4, and thus appellants' public interest argument fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Reliance on Cape Wind's affirmation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, appellants argue that Cape Wind's affirmation that it possessed the requisite property interests was obviously false, as there exists no mechanism by which private entities can obtain a license to construct a data tower on the federally controlled OCS. The Corps's grant of a Section 10 permit on the basis of this false affirmation was therefore arbitrary and capricious, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. &#167; 706(2)(A). Again, this line of attack is not deflected by reference to Corps regulations. Appellants note that agency decisions based on false factual information run afoul of the Administrative Procedure Act. <i>See, e.g., Missouri Serv. Comm'n v. FERC,</i> 337 F.3d 1066, 1075 (D.C.Cir.2003) (\"Reliance on facts that an agency knows are false at the time it relies on them is the essence of arbitrary and capricious decisionmaking.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Appellants' argument hinges on the veracity of Cape Wind's affirmation, which in turn depends, appellants argue, on whether authorization in addition to a Section 10 permit is necessary for construction of the data tower.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> The first part of our opinion holds that a Section 10 permit is <i>necessary</i> for all structures on the OCS unless otherwise indicated by law, but does not determine whether such a permit is <i>sufficient</i> to authorize building on the federally controlled OCS.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether, and under what circumstances, additional authorization is necessary before a developer infringes on the federal government's rights in the OCS is a thorny issue, one that is unnecessary to delve into in the instant case. The data tower at issue here involves no real infringement on federal interests in the OCS lands. To start, the structure is temporary, of five years' duration, more than two of which have now passed. The tower is also not exclusive &#8212; it must accept data collection devices form the government and others, and it must give the data to the government. The tower is a single structure, and it provides valuable information that the Corps requires in order to evaluate the larger wind energy plant proposal. The Corps's public interest evaluation of the data tower resulted in a finding of \"negligible impact\" on property ownership and stated that collection of the data is in the public interest. Environmental Assessment at 4-5. It is inconceivable to us that permission to erect a single, temporary scientific device, like this, which gives the federal government information it requires, could be an infringement on any federal property ownership interest in the OCS.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the question of infringement of federal property interests is entirely hypothetical in this case. As a result, appellants' arguments based both on the arbitrary and capricious provision in the APA and the public interest standards discussed in <i>Alaska</i> are misplaced. We do not here evaluate whether congressional authorization is necessary for construction of Cape Wind's proposed wind energy plant, a structure vastly larger in scale, complexity, and duration, which is not at issue in the present action. Our analysis is limited to whether additional Congressional authorization is necessary for the data tower, which does not infringe on any federal property interest, and we conclude that it is not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.

Appellants argue that the Corps violated CEQ regulations by failing to circulate for public comment a draft EA and FONSI.

Appellees reject this interpretation, citing contrary precedent from a number of other circuits and noting that the quoted language in <i>Citizens for Better Forestry</i> was <i>dicta.</i> Appellees argue that the Corps met the requirement of involving the public \"to the extent practicable\" in preparing the EA by issuing public notice of Cape Wind's application, providing a comment period that they later extended to over five months, carrying out two public hearings, noting and responding to public comments in the EA, and conferring with federal and state environmental agencies. We agree.

Appellants argue that the data tower proposal is \"without precedent\" because Nantucket Sound is a pristine, undeveloped area and because \"there is no precedent for permitting a privately-owned structure for wind energy, or even related research, on OCS lands.\" The Corps, however, determined that \"[t]here is precedent for this type of structure in Massachusetts's waters,\" in the form of a data tower in Martha's Vineyard. Environmental Assessment at 10. The district court agreed, relying on the Corps's findings that while \"[t]here are no other similar structures or devices in Horseshoe Shoals,\" a data tower was permitted in state waters off Martha's Vineyard, and Cape Wind's data tower was \"not inconsistent with other pile supported structures in the marine environment in Nantucket Sound.\" <i>Id.</i> at 2; <i>see Alliance,</i> 288 F.Supp.2d at 78-79.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that the Corps's determination that the data tower is not without precedent, on the basis of physically similar structures in nearby waters, was reasonable. We do not agree with appellants' argument that construction of structures like the data tower on the OCS without additional authorization from Congress is without precedent, but even if that were so, it would suggest only that issuance of the permit is <i>legally</i> unprecedented. The CEQ regulations, however, are designed to address environmental impact. Based on the Corps's findings about the existence of similar pile-driven structures in Martha's Vineyard and near the shore of Nantucket Sound, we can see nothing unprecedented about the way this data tower will impact the environment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Thus, we find that the Corps fully complied with its obligations under NEPA and CEQ regulations to engage with the public in preparing the EA and FONSI.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the district court is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Section 10 delegates authority to the Corps to issue permits for projects that impact on the navigability of United States waters. 33 U.S.C. &#167; 403</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> While the term \"resources\" is not defined in OCSLA, \"exploration,\" \"development,\" and \"production\" are all defined in terms of \"mineral,\" which is in turn defined as \"includ[ing] oil, gas, sulphur, geopressured-geothermal and associated resources, and all other minerals which are authorized by an Act of Congress to be produced from `public lands'.\" 43 U.S.C. &#167; 1331(k), (<i>l</i>), (m), (q).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Appellants' argument that the district court erred by elevating the importance of legislative history to supercede that of the plain language of OCSLA is without merit in this case.

Because of the development of relatively impermanent structures, which did not clearly fall within the \"fixed structures\" rubric, Congress amended Subsection (a) in 1978 to apply instead to \"all artificial islands and <i>all installations and other devices permanently or temporarily attached to the seabed,</i> which may be erected thereon for the purpose of exploring for, developing, or producing resources therefrom.\" <i>See</i> H.R.Rep.

Horseshoe Shoals is located on the Outer Continental Shelf (\"OCS\"), land subject to federal jurisdiction and control under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (\"OCSLA\"), 43 U.S.C. &#167; 1331.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The proposed tower was to consist of a platform and a fixed monopole approximately 170 feet high, supported by three steel piles driven into the ocean floor. Various instrumentation was to be attached to the data tower in order to gather data for use in determining the feasibility of locating a wind energy plant on Horseshoe Shoals. A separate permit application for the wind energy plant &#8212; a complex originally proposed to include 170 wind turbines with blade rotors rising 423 feet above mean sea level, occupying twenty-six square miles of Horseshoe Shoals &#8212; was submitted to the Corps in November 2001. That application is not at issue in the instant appeal, and we therefore will not engage in any analysis of the Corps's authority to permit construction of the wind energy plant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 4, 2001, the Corps announced that it was considering Cape Wind's application for the data tower, and invited the public to submit comments during a period that included two public hearings and ended on May 13, 2002. On August 19, the Corps issued a Section 10 permit authorizing Cape Wind to construct and maintain the data tower, subject to the imposition of sixteen special conditions, including that Cape Wind remove the data tower within five years, that it post a $300,000 bond for emergency repairs or removal, and that it share the data collected with, and permit the installation of additional data-gathering equipment by, government agencies, research institutions, and others. Department of the Army Permit No. 199902477 (Aug. 19, 2002). The permit was accompanied by an Environmental Assessment (\"EA\") and Finding of No Significant Impact (\"FONSI\"), as required by the National Environmental Policy Act (\"NEPA\"), 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 4331-32.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants subsequently filed an action against the Corps in the District of Massachusetts, arguing that (1) the Corps lacked authority to issue a Section 10 permit for the data tower; (2) the Corps acted arbitrarily and capriciously, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), 5 U.S.C. &#167; 706(2)(A), by granting Cape Wind's permit application in spite of Cape Wind's lack of property rights on the OCS; and (3) the Corps failed to comply with NEPA requirements for evaluating the data tower's environmental impacts. Upon the receipt of cross motions for summary judgment, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the Corps and intervenor Cape Wind.

Congress passed OCSLA in 1953 to assert federal jurisdiction over the OCS and to establish a regulatory framework for the extraction of minerals therefrom. <i>See</i> 43 U.S.C. &#167; 1332; <i>see also Ten Taxpayer Citizens Group v.

Accordingly, OCSLA extended the Corps's Section 10 regulatory authority \"to prevent obstruction to navigation in the navigable waters of the United States ... to artificial islands and fixed structures located on the [OCS].\" 43 U.S.C. &#167; 1333(f) (1953). In 1978, this grant of authority was amended to apply instead to \"the artificial islands, installations, and other devices referred to in subsection (a) of this section.\" 43 U.S.C. &#167; 1333(e) (2004). Subsection (a), in turn, extends federal jurisdiction to:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>all</i> artificial islands, and <i>all</i> installations and other devices permanently or temporarily attached to the seabed, <i>which may be erected thereon for the purpose of exploring for, developing, or producing resources therefrom,</i> or any such installation or other device (other than a ship or vessel) for the purpose of transporting such resources.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at &#167; 1333(a)(1) (emphasis supplied).

The Corps, on the other hand, has determined that its Section 10 authority \"was extended to artificial islands, installations, and other devices located on the seabed, to the seaward limit of the [OCS], by section 4(f) of [OCSLA] as amended.\" 33 C.F.R. &#167; 320.2(b) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court determined that the \"which may be\" clause of Subsection (a) was not restrictive. <i>See Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, Inc. v.

Thus, the district court held, the Corps has authority to grant a Section 10 permit for all structures on the OCS, regardless of their function.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find the statutory text in question ambiguous.

In light of this ambiguity, the Corps and Cape Wind invite us to defer to the Corps's interpretation of its authority, <i>see</i> 33 C.F.R. &#167; 320.2(b), under the <i>Chevron</i> doctrine. <i>See Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v.

This interpretation strains the Conference Report language well beyond the meaning it can bear, especially in light of Congress's awareness when it amended OCSLA that the Corps had issued Section 10 permits for OCS structures unrelated to mineral extraction on several occasions between 1953 and 1978, implying its approval of the exercise of such jurisdiction. <i>See</i> Conference Report at 81 (\"[The Corps's existing] authority has been used... to regulate the construction and location of ... artificial fishing reefs, radio towers, and a proposed gambling casino which was to be constructed on reefs. It <i>also</i> applies to structures erected for the purpose of exploring for and transporting resources....\" (emphasis supplied)). Appellants' efforts to counter this legislative history with language from the Senate Report from the original 1953 OCSLA that could be read to imply a limitation of Corps permitting authority to structures intended for mineral resource development is unavailing. The Corps's current authority is determined by OCSLA as amended in 1978, and the Conference Report addresses Congress's intent at that time. <i>See also United States v.

In the Corps's view, &#167; 320.4(g)(6)'s requirement that a \"dispute over property ownership will not be a factor in the Corps public interest decision\" applies to preclude consideration of a dispute over the adequacy of an applicant's property interests in the project site. <i>See</i> Environmental Assessment at 14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants argued before the district court that the requirement that applicants affirm possession of the requisite property interests for the proposed activity, 33 C.F.R. &#167; 320.4(g)(6), means that such property interests must, in fact, be possessed by the applicant. Because Cape Wind had no property interest in the proposed data tower site, nor could it obtain such an interest under current law, its Section 10 permit application ought to have been denied. The district court rejected this argument, deferring instead to the Corps's interpretation that &#167; 320.4(g)(6) requires only an affirmation from the applicant, which Cape Wind provided. According to the district court, &#167; 320.4(g)(6), as interpreted by the Corps, fit in as \"part of a [regulatory] scheme designed to keep the Corps out of property disputes.\" <i>Alliance,</i> 288 F.Supp.2d at 77.

The regulation next states that \"[t]he dispute over property ownership will not be a factor in the Corps public interest decision.\" \"The dispute\" refers back to the category of disputes that result in a reminder of the need to obtain all required property interests. It is reasonable, in this context, to determine that \"the dispute over property ownership\" into which the Corps may not enter includes a dispute over whether the applicant has acquired all requisite property interests &#8212; that is, a dispute over the sufficiency of the applicant's property interests. Further, the goal of preventing the Corps from expending its resources on evaluating the legal question of the sufficiency of property interests is a reasonable one. This is so whether the dispute is over the sufficiency of the applicant's interests as opposed to those of other private property holders in the area, or as opposed to those of the federal government, especially since the Corps is permitted to consider the potential <i>impact</i> of the project on others' property interests during its public interest review. <i>See</i> 33 C.F.R. &#167; 320.4(a)(1) (listing \"considerations of property ownership\" as factor to consider in determining whether, and under what conditions, to grant permit).

The Corps is not shielded from this line of attack by its reliance on &#167; 320.4(g)(6). Appellants properly point out that the Corps must consider, despite &#167; 320.4(g)(6), the impact of a permit issuance on federal property rights in various ways, as part of its general public interest review. <i>See</i> 33 C.F.R. &#167; 320.4(a)(1) (impact of project on \"considerations of property ownership\" must be a factor in the Corps's analysis); <i>United States v.

The Corps's grant of a Section 10 permit on the basis of this false affirmation was therefore arbitrary and capricious, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. &#167; 706(2)(A). Again, this line of attack is not deflected by reference to Corps regulations. Appellants note that agency decisions based on false factual information run afoul of the Administrative Procedure Act. <i>See, e.g., Missouri Serv. Comm'n v.

The data tower at issue here involves no real infringement on federal interests in the OCS lands. To start, the structure is temporary, of five years' duration, more than two of which have now passed. The tower is also not exclusive &#8212; it must accept data collection devices form the government and others, and it must give the data to the government. The tower is a single structure, and it provides valuable information that the Corps requires in order to evaluate the larger wind energy plant proposal. The Corps's public interest evaluation of the data tower resulted in a finding of \"negligible impact\" on property ownership and stated that collection of the data is in the public interest. Environmental Assessment at 4-5. It is inconceivable to us that permission to erect a single, temporary scientific device, like this, which gives the federal government information it requires, could be an infringement on any federal property ownership interest in the OCS.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the question of infringement of federal property interests is entirely hypothetical in this case. As a result, appellants' arguments based both on the arbitrary and capricious provision in the APA and the public interest standards discussed in <i>Alaska</i> are misplaced. We do not here evaluate whether congressional authorization is necessary for construction of Cape Wind's proposed wind energy plant, a structure vastly larger in scale, complexity, and duration, which is not at issue in the present action. Our analysis is limited to whether additional Congressional authorization is necessary for the data tower, which does not infringe on any federal property interest, and we conclude that it is not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.

Appellants argue that the data tower proposal is \"without precedent\" because Nantucket Sound is a pristine, undeveloped area and because \"there is no precedent for permitting a privately-owned structure for wind energy, or even related research, on OCS lands.\" The Corps, however, determined that \"[t]here is precedent for this type of structure in Massachusetts's waters,\" in the form of a data tower in Martha's Vineyard. Environmental Assessment at 10. The district court agreed, relying on the Corps's findings that while \"[t]here are no other similar structures or devices in Horseshoe Shoals,\" a data tower was permitted in state waters off Martha's Vineyard, and Cape Wind's data tower was \"not inconsistent with other pile supported structures in the marine environment in Nantucket Sound.\" <i>Id.</i> at 2; <i>see Alliance,</i> 288 F.Supp.2d at 78-79.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that the Corps's determination that the data tower is not without precedent, on the basis of physically similar structures in nearby waters, was reasonable.
