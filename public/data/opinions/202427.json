Specifically, De Los Santos faults the district\n\ncourt for relying, in large part,1 on his prior illegal reentry\n\nconviction in concluding that he had no respect for the laws of the\n\nUnited   States      (and      therefore      rejecting       the   government's\n\nrecommendation that he be sentenced at the bottom of the applicable\n\nguideline   range)      even   though    that       prior   conviction    and   its\n\nproximity   to    the   instant   offense      were    also   reflected    in   his\n\ncriminal history category.         Assuming that De Los Santos did not\n\nforfeit this ground for objection by not raising it below,2 we\n\nreject it as a basis for invalidating the resulting sentence as\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      The district court also relied on De Los Santos's \"mak[ing]\nup excuses as to why he came [back to the United States]\" after\ntwice being deported even though \"[he] knew he could not come\nagain,\" and commented adversely on this pattern of misconduct by\nsaying that \"we don't need this kind of situation in this country.\"\n     2\n      In the district court, De Los Santos argued only that his\nviolation of the conditions of his supervised release for the prior\nillegal reentry conviction would be taken into account in a pending\nrevocation proceeding in the earlier case. In fact, however, the\nrecord of the earlier case indicates that no action was taken on\nthe violation.    Accordingly, to the extent that De Los Santos\npresses that argument here, we reject it.\n\n                                        -2-\n\funreasonable under United States v.

Compare 28 U.S.C. § 994 with 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).
