Plaintiff Puerto Rico Hospital\n\nSupply,   Inc.   (“PRHS”)   filed    suit   against   Boston   Scientific\n\nCorporation (“BSC”) in the United States District Court in Puerto\n\nRico for the purpose of obtaining a preliminary injunction pending\n\narbitration before the International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC”).\n\nPRHS appeals the district court’s denial of the injunction on the\n\nbasis that the district court applied the wrong legal standard. We\n\nAFFIRM the district court.\n\n                             I.   BACKGROUND\n\n     PRHS is a Puerto Rico company in the business of distributing\n\nmedical products. BSC is a manufacturer of medical products and is\n\nincorporated in Delaware with a principal place of business in\n\nMassachusetts. In 1989, the two businesses entered into a contract\n\nunder which PRHS would become the exclusive distributor of BSC\n\nproducts in Puerto Rico.      The contract specified that PRHS would\n\nuse its “best efforts to develop and promote” BSC’s products and\n\nthat PRHS would “maintain, at [PRHS’s] own expense, an adequate\n\ninventory” of BSC products.         The term of the agreement was one\n\nyear, but it could be extended for additional one-year periods\n\nprovided that both parties agreed to the extension.        The contract\n\nwas extended for one-year periods through the normal course of\n\nbusiness until 2005.        Under the contract, either party could\n\nterminate or not renew the agreement for cause after giving the\n\nbreaching party sixty days to remedy the problem.        Otherwise, any\n\n\n                                    - 2 -\n\fparty could terminate the agreement by giving the other twelve\n\nmonths   notice.        The   choice-of-law   provision   states    that   the\n\nagreement “shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of\n\nMassachusetts and, to the extent applicable, the Commonwealth of\n\nPuerto Rico and the United States of America.”               The agreement\n\nspecifies that all disputes, including those relating to the\n\nconstruction of the contract, shall be arbitrated under the rules\n\nand the governance of the ICC.\n\n       In a letter dated April 29, 2005, BSC sent PRHS notice that it\n\ndid not intend to renew the contract after it was set to expire on\n\nJune 30, 2005.      The letter cited three reasons for not wishing to\n\nrenew:   1) that PRHS “failed to use its best efforts to develop and\n\npromote the use and sale” of BSC products such that “BSC’s goodwill\n\nhas been negatively affected” causing a loss of “millions of\n\ndollars in sales”; 2) that PRHS “failed to maintain an adequate\n\ninventory” of BSC products; and 3) that PRHS failed to “timely pay\n\nthe amounts owed” to BSC.        The letter stated that if PRHS began to\n\nmeet its contractual obligations, BSC would reconsider terminating\n\ntheir relationship.\n\n       PRHS filed a complaint with the ICC to arbitrate the merits of\n\nthis case.     It also filed a complaint in district court for the\n\nsole    purpose    of   obtaining    a   preliminary   injunction    pending\n\narbitration.      The ICC rules provide that either an arbitrator or a\n\ncourt can issue interim relief.           The district court denied the\n\n\n                                     - 3 -\n\fmotion for injunctive relief by analyzing this case under the\n\ntraditional test. PRHS appeals. This court has jurisdiction under\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1).\n\n                             II.    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n      This court reviews the denial of the preliminary injunction\n\nfor an abuse of discretion.               Charlesbank Equity Fund II v. Blinds\n\nTo Go, Inc., 370 F.3d 151, 158 (1st Cir. 2004).                 This court reviews\n\nabstract issues of law de novo, recognizing that an error of law is\n\nalways an abuse of discretion. Id. Factual findings, however, are\n\nreviewed for clear error.                 New Comm Wireless Servs., Inc. v.\n\nSprintCom, Inc., 287 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n                                   III.    DISCUSSION\n\n      A   district     court       has    jurisdiction     to   issue   preliminary\n\ninjunctions     to    preserve       the    status   quo   pending      arbitration.\n\nBercovitch v. Baldwin Sch., Inc., 133 F.3d 141, 151 (1st Cir. 1998)\n\n(citing Teradyne, Inc. v. Mostek Corp., 797 F.2d 43, 51 (1st Cir.\n\n1986)).    Additionally, the ICC rules, which were incorporated into\n\nthe   contract,      allow    either       the   arbitrator     or   “any   competent\n\njudicial authority” to issue interim relief.                  Rules of Arbitration\n\nof        the        ICC,          Article           23,        available         at\n\nhttp://www.iccwbo.org/court/english/arbitration/rules.asp.                     Thus,\n\nthe court did not err in hearing the               case and deciding the matter.\n\n      The essence of PRHS’s argument is that the district court\n\nerred in not making a “provisional choice of law,” and that such a\n\n\n                                           - 4 -\n\fchoice would have resulted in the application of Puerto Rico’s Law\n\n75, 10 P.R. Laws Ann. § 278 (“Law 75”).3          Because this argument was\n\nnot made below, it was waived.        See Carcieri v. Norton, 398 F.3d\n\n22, 39 (1st Cir. 2005) (“The general rule is that issues not raised\n\nin district court cannot be raised for the first time on appeal as\n\na matter of right.”).\n\n      Additionally, PRHS’s actions below appear to have invited the\n\nvery error it now claims.    See     Austin v. Unarco Indus., Inc., 705\n\nF.2d 1, 15 (1st Cir. 1983) (citing McPhail v. Mun. of Culebra, 598\n\nF.2d 603, 607 (1st Cir. 1979)).             In general, “a party may not\n\nappeal from an error to which he contributed, either by failing to\n\nobject or by affirmatively presenting to the court the wrong law.”\n\nId.   The district court repeatedly stated that it would not make a\n\nchoice-of-law determination, despite BSC’s insistence that it must\n\ndo so to properly rule on the motion.         Not only did PRHS not object\n\nto    the   court’s   intentions,    but     it    also   stated   that   the\n\ndetermination would not turn on a choice-of-law interpretation.\n\nRather, PRHS stated, in relevant part:            “My point and my client’s\n\npoint is that this court should not go into either Puerto Rico law\n\n. . . or . . . Massachusetts law to decide whether my client . . .\n\n\n      3\n     Law 75 is a Puerto Rican dealers’ law enacted “to protect\nPuerto Rico dealers from the harm caused when a supplier\narbitrarily terminates a distributorship once the dealer has\ncreated a favorable market for the supplier’s products,” which\nprevents suppliers from refusing to renew or terminating a covered\ncontract, except for just cause. R.W. Int’l Corp. v. Welch Food,\nInc., 13 F.3d 478, 482 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n                                    - 5 -\n\fis entitled to the injunction” and “[m]y only request to this Court\n\nis [to] . . . retain the status quo, and let the arbitrator decide,\n\nwhether it is Massachusetts [or] Puerto Rico” law. In its opinion,\n\nthe district court followed federal law; and, as PRHS implored the\n\ncourt not to determine applicable law, PRHS cannot now assert error\n\nfor the choice.\n\n      Even if there is no invited error or waiver, the district\n\ncourt was faced with an ambiguous choice-of-law provision.               The\n\nparties’ contract stated that “[t]his Agreement . . . shall be\n\ngoverned by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and, to\n\nthe extent applicable, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the\n\nUnited States of America.” This provision is ambiguous because the\n\nphrase “to the extent applicable” does not clearly dictate which\n\nlaw should apply under what circumstances.            PRHS’s witness said\n\nthat he wanted Puerto Rico law to apply, and suggested that this\n\nwas in order to gain the benefits of Law 75.          BSC, of course, may\n\nnot have shared this understanding.”         Because neither the contract\n\nnor   the   evidence   presented   clarify    the   parties’   intent,   the\n\nprovision is ambiguous.\n\n      Ambiguous choice-of-law provisions should be determined by the\n\narbitrator, not the district court.        Medika Int’l, Inc. v. Scanlan\n\nInt’l, Inc., 830 F. Supp. 81, 88 (D.P.R. 1993).         However, the fact\n\nthat the choice-of-law determination is left to the arbitrator\n\nshould not prevent a district court from making a preliminary\n\n\n                                   - 6 -\n\fjudgment   regarding     which    law     to    apply    for   the   purposes    of\n\ninjunctive relief.       In the face of an ambiguous choice-of-law\n\nprovision, the district judge made a permissible choice to apply\n\nfederal law as the default standard for preliminary injunction\n\npurposes. In Medika Int’l, Inc. v. Scanlan Int’l Inc., the court\n\nexamined a contract involving a Minnesota choice-of-law provision\n\nwhich may have contravened Law 75.              Id.     The court held that the\n\narbitrator should decide the applicability of Minnesota law, and it\n\napplied federal law when determining the merits of the plaintiff’s\n\nrequest for a preliminary injunction.                 Id.   Because preliminary\n\nrelief   is   intended    to     deal    with    temporary     conditions,      the\n\ndistrict’s court decision to apply the federal law standard, given\n\nthe ambiguous choice-of-law provision, was a reasonable one.                    The\n\ndistrict court thus did not err in applying federal law.\n\n     PRHS relies on Danieli & C. Officine Meccaniche S.p.A. v.\n\nMorgan Constr. Co., 190 F. Supp. 2d 148, 156-57 (D. Mass. 2002),\n\nfor the proposition that a district court has the authority to make\n\na provisional choice of law.        Yet that decision explicitly stated\n\nthat when “an agreement contains a valid arbitration clause as well\n\nas a choice of law provision, the determination of what law applies\n\nshould be made by the arbitrator.”               Id.     The district judge in\n\nDanieli declined to make a choice-of-law determination; rather, he\n\nsimply selected what law to apply for the limited purpose of\n\nevaluating the availability of preliminary injunctive relief.                   Id.\n\n\n                                        - 7 -\n\fSimilarly, in the case at hand, the district court used the federal\n\nstandard to determine if PRHS was entitled to an injunction, but\n\ndid not address the likelihood of success on the merits because\n\nPRHS had not proven irreparable harm.\n\n        To determine whether PRHS was entitled to an injunction, an\n\napplicable law must be selected - the district court chose federal\n\nlaw.1       Both the Medika and Danieli courts relied on the traditional\n\nfour-part test for preliminary injunctions, and the district court\n\nhere did not err in doing the same.         Because this case involved the\n\ndistrict court’s authority to issue an injunction under the FAA,\n\nand because the choice-of-law provision provided that the case\n\nshould be governed by federal law “to the extent applicable,” the\n\ndistrict court properly applied federal law, leaving for the\n\narbitrator the choice-of-law determination.\n\n\n        1\n      The Massachusetts standard for issuing a preliminary\ninjunction closely tracks the federal standard:\n     The judge initially evaluates in combination the moving\n     party's claim of injury and chance of success on the merits.\n     If the judge is convinced that failure to issue the injunction\n     would subject the moving party to a substantial risk of\n     irreparable harm, the judge must then balance this risk\n     against any similar risk of irreparable harm which granting\n     the injunction would create for the opposing party. What\n     matters as to each party is not the raw amount of irreparable\n     harm the party might conceivably suffer, but rather the risk\n     of such harm in light of the party's chance of success on the\n     merits.\nSiemens Bldg. Techs., Inc. v. Div. of Asset Capital Mgmt., 791\nN.E.2d 340, 343 (Mass. 2003).\n\n\n\n\n                                    - 8 -\n\f     Even if the district court’s application of federal law was in\n\nerror, any such error is harmless because there is no clear\n\nindication that the case would come out differently under Law 75,\n\nwhich, although not explicitly requiring irreparable harm, does\n\nentail a balancing of the equities.    The federal test looks to the\n\nfollowing four factors: 1) the likelihood of success on the merits;\n\n2) the potential for irreparable harm if the injunction is not\n\ngranted; 3) the balance of impositions on both parties; and 4) the\n\neffect of the ruling on the public interest.        Air Line Pilots\n\nAss’n, Int’l. v. Guilford Transp. Indus., Inc., 399 F.3d 89, 95\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).   Law 75 prohibits the termination of established\n\nbusiness relationships in Puerto Rico without “just cause,” and to\n\nobtain an preliminary injunction, the plaintiff must show: 1) the\n\npublic policy of Law 75; 2) whether the plaintiff is a dealer; and\n\n3) the interests of the parties and balancing the equities.   Tatan\n\nMgmt. v. Jacfran Corp., 270 F. Supp. 2d 197, 200 (D.P.R. 2003).\n\n     The district court denied PRHS’s request for an injunction on\n\nthe basis that it could not show an irreparable injury.    There is\n\nlittle to suggest that once the district judge found there was no\n\nirreparable harm threatened, he would have gone on to grant a\n\npreliminary injunction in light of the rather serious breach of\n\ncontract allegations raised by BSC against PRHS. PRHS claimed that\n\nit would be harmed because it would lose profits, that one of its\n\nemployees would be affected in some way, and that its business\n\n\n                               - 9 -\n\fwould be impacted.            None of these factual findings has been\n\nchallenged on appeal, and none of them is clearly erroneous based\n\non the record.      These injuries are not irreparable because later-\n\nissued damages can properly compensate any wrong committed.                   Rio\n\nGrande Cmty. Health Ctr. v. Rullan, 397 F.3d 56, 76 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).      Because    PRHS    cannot      establish   irreparable    harm,   the\n\ndistrict    court     did   not    abuse    its   discretion   in   denying   the\n\ninjunction, and any error of law is harmless.\n\n                                  IV.   CONCLUSION\n\n     For the above reasons, the decision of the district court is\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 10 -\n\f",

Laws Ann. &#167; 278 (\"Law 75\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Because this argument was not made below, it was waived. <i>See Carcieri v.

In general, \"a party may not appeal from an error to which he contributed, either by failing to object or by affirmatively presenting to the court the wrong law.\" <i>Id.</i> The district court repeatedly stated that it would not make a choice-of-law determination, despite BSC's insistence that it must do so to properly rule on the motion. Not only did PRHS not object to the court's intentions, but it also stated that the determination would not turn on a choice-of-law interpretation. Rather, PRHS stated, in relevant part: \"My point and my client's point is that this court should not go into either Puerto Rico law. . . or . . . Massachusetts law to decide whether my client . . . is entitled to the injunction\" and \"[m]y only request to this Court is [to] . . . retain the status quo, and let the arbitrator decide, whether it is Massachusetts [or] Puerto Rico\" law. In its opinion, the district court followed federal law; and, as PRHS implored the court not to determine applicable law, PRHS cannot now assert error for the choice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if there is no invited error or waiver, the district court was faced with an ambiguous choice-of-law provision. The parties' contract stated that \"[t]his Agreement . . . shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and, to the extent applicable, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the United States of America.\" This provision is ambiguous because the phrase \"to the extent applicable\" does not clearly dictate which law should apply under what circumstances. PRHS's witness said that he wanted Puerto Rico law to apply, and suggested that this was in order to gain the benefits of Law 75. BSC, \"of course, may not have shared this understanding.\" Because neither the contract nor the evidence presented clarify the parties' intent, the provision is ambiguous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ambiguous choice-of-law provisions should be determined by the arbitrator, not the district court. <i>Medika Int'l, Inc. v. Scanlan Int'l, Inc.,</i> 830 F.Supp. 81, 88 (D.P.R.1993). However, the fact that the choice-of-law determination is left to the arbitrator should not prevent a district court from making a preliminary judgment regarding which law to apply for the purposes of injunctive relief. In the face of an ambiguous choice-of-law provision, the district judge made a permissible choice to apply federal law as the default standard for preliminary injunction purposes. In <i>Medika Int'l, Inc. v. Scanlan Int'l Inc.,</i> the court examined a contract involving a Minnesota choice-of-law provision which may have contravened Law 75. <i>Id.</i> The court held that the arbitrator should decide the applicability of Minnesota law, and it applied federal law when determining the merits of the plaintiff's request for a preliminary injunction. <i>Id.</i> Because preliminary relief is intended to deal with temporary conditions, the district's court decision to apply the federal law standard, given the ambiguous choice-of-law provision, was a reasonable one. The district court thus did not err in applying federal law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PRHS relies on <i>Danieli &amp; C.

Yet that decision explicitly stated that when \"an agreement contains a valid arbitration clause as well as a choice of law provision, the determination of what law applies should be made by the arbitrator.\" <i>Id.</i> The district judge in <i>Danieli</i> declined to make a choice-of-law determination; rather, he simply selected what law to apply for the limited purpose of evaluating the availability of preliminary injunctive relief. <i>Id.</i> Similarly, in the case at hand, the district court used the federal standard to determine if PRHS was entitled to an injunction, but did not address the likelihood of success on the merits because PRHS had not proven irreparable harm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To determine whether PRHS was entitled to an injunction, an applicable law must be selected &#8212; the district court chose federal law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Both the <i>Medika</i> and <i>Danieli</i> courts relied on the traditional four-part test for preliminary injunctions, and the district court here did not err in doing the same. Because this case involved the district court's authority to issue an injunction under the FAA, and because the choice-of-law provision provided that the case should be governed by federal law \"to the extent applicable,\" the district court properly applied federal law, leaving for the arbitrator the choice-of-law determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the district court's application of federal law was in error, any such error is harmless because there is no clear indication that the case would come out differently under Law 75, which, although not explicitly requiring irreparable harm, does entail a balancing of the equities. The federal test looks to the following four factors: 1) the likelihood of success on the merits; 2) the potential for irreparable harm if the injunction is not granted; 3) the balance of impositions on both parties; and 4) the effect of the ruling on the public interest. <i>Air Line Pilots Ass'n, Int'l. v.

Law 75 prohibits the termination of established business relationships in Puerto Rico without \"just cause,\" and to obtain an preliminary injunction, the plaintiff must show: 1) the public policy of Law 75; 2) whether the plaintiff is a dealer; and 3) the interests of the parties and balancing the equities. <i>Tatan Mgmt. v.

There is little to suggest that once the district judge found there was no irreparable harm threatened, he would have gone on to grant a preliminary injunction in light of the rather serious breach of contract allegations raised by BSC against PRHS. PRHS claimed that it would be harmed because it would lose profits, that one of its employees would be affected in some way, and that its business would be impacted. None of these factual findings has been challenged on appeal, and none of them is clearly erroneous based on the record. These injuries are not irreparable because later-issued damages can properly compensate any wrong committed. <i>Rio Grande Cmty. Health Ctr. v. Rullan,</i> 397 F.3d 56, 76 (1st Cir.2005). Because PRHS cannot establish irreparable harm, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the injunction, and any error of law is harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.

What matters as to each party is not the raw amount of irreparable harm the party might conceivably suffer, but rather the risk of such harm in light of the party's chance of success on the merits.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\"><i>Siemens Bldg.

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PRHS is a Puerto Rico company in the business of distributing medical products. BSC is a manufacturer of medical products and is incorporated in Delaware with a principal place of business in Massachusetts. In 1989, the two businesses entered into a contract under which PRHS would become the exclusive distributor of BSC products in Puerto Rico. The contract specified that PRHS would use its \"best efforts to develop and promote\" BSC's products and that PRHS would \"maintain, at [PRHS's] own expense, an adequate inventory\" of BSC products. The term of the agreement was one year, but it could be extended for additional one-year periods provided that both parties agreed to the extension. The contract was extended for one-year periods through the normal course of business until 2005. Under the contract, either party could terminate or not renew the agreement for cause after giving the breaching party sixty days to remedy the problem. Otherwise, any party could terminate the agreement by giving the other twelve months notice. The choice-of-law provision states that the agreement \"shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and, to the extent applicable, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the United States of America.\" The agreement specifies that all disputes, including those relating to the construction of the contract, shall be arbitrated under the rules and the governance of the ICC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a letter dated April 29, 2005, BSC sent PRHS notice that it did not intend to renew the contract after it was set to expire on June 30, 2005. The letter cited three reasons for not wishing to renew: 1) that PRHS \"failed to use its best efforts to develop and promote the use and sale\" of BSC products such that \"BSC's goodwill has been negatively affected\" causing a loss of \"millions of dollars in sales\"; 2) that PRHS \"failed to maintain an adequate inventory\" of BSC products; and 3) that PRHS failed to \"timely pay the amounts owed\" to BSC. The letter stated that if PRHS began to meet its contractual obligations, BSC would reconsider terminating their relationship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PRHS filed a complaint with the ICC to arbitrate the merits of this case. It also filed a complaint in district court for the sole purpose of obtaining a preliminary injunction pending arbitration. The ICC rules provide that either an arbitrator or a court can issue interim relief. The district court denied the motion for injunctive relief by analyzing this case under the traditional test. PRHS appeals. This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1292(a)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.

If the judge is convinced that failure to issue the injunction would subject the moving party to a substantial risk of irreparable harm, the judge must then balance this risk against any similar risk of irreparable harm which granting the injunction would create for the opposing party. What matters as to each party is not the raw amount of irreparable harm the party might conceivably suffer, but rather the risk of such harm in light of the party's chance of success on the merits.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\"><i>Siemens Bldg.
