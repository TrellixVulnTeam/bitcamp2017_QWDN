Plaintiff-appellant James J.\n\nPalmieri (\"Palmieri\") brought suit against his former employer,\n\ndefendant-appellee Nynex Long Distance Co. d/b/a Verizon Enterprise\n\nSolutions (\"Verizon\"), claiming that he was eligible for overtime\n\npay for his work at the company.            The district court granted\n\nsummary judgment for Verizon, and Palmieri here contests this\n\ndecision.    After careful consideration, we affirm.\n\n                              I.    Facts\n\n            For nearly fifteen years, Palmieri worked for Verizon, a\n\nlarge telecommunications vendor, and its corporate predecessors.\n\nDuring his time at the company, he rose through the ranks and in\n\n1997 attained the position of \"Account Manager,\" later renamed\n\n\"Corporate Account Manager 3\" (\"CAM 3\").            This is one of the\n\nhighest level sales positions at Verizon.            Palmieri held this\n\nposition until his employment was terminated in August 2002.\n\n            As a CAM 3 working out of Verizon's office in Portland,\n\nMaine, Palmieri sold products and services associated with high-\n\nspeed voice and data networks.     He was expected to deal only with\n\na limited number of large customers.             In particular, he was\n\nassigned a module of 20 to 50 large customer accounts.        He was not\n\npermitted to call on customers who were not within his assigned\n\nmodule.   This meant that he needed to make repeat sales to the same\n\ncustomers in his module.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\f          To   accomplish       this,    he    had   quarterly    meetings,    or\n\n\"planning sessions,\" with his customers.              In these meetings, the\n\ncustomers would state their general needs and goals, and Palmieri\n\nwould attempt to sell solutions to satisfy them.                 Palmieri also\n\nentertained the customers in his module by taking them to lunch or\n\ndinner, to Red Sox games, or to shows at the Wang Theater in\n\nBoston.   This     was   done   so    that    Palmieri   could    maintain    his\n\nrelationships and position himself well to make repeat sales to the\n\ncustomers in his module.\n\n          To handle the difficulties associated with making sales\n\nto large, institutional customers, Verizon provided CAM 3s such as\n\nPalmieri with a great deal of institutional support.               For example,\n\nthe company maintained a multi-tiered account team to address\n\ncustomer-service    issues.          This     team   provided    technical    and\n\nadministrative support, so that the CAM 3s could focus their\n\nefforts on sales.\n\n          Verizon also gave Palmieri and other CAM 3s tremendous\n\nfreedom in their daily routines.                Palmieri, for example, was\n\nresponsible for all parts of the sales transactions, including\n\nface-to-face   client    meetings,       contract     negotiations,    and    the\n\nsigning of sales contracts.              He and other CAM 3s also were\n\npermitted to set their own schedules based on their customers.\n\nWhen asked about his schedule, Palmieri testified as follows:\n\n          I approached my job as an entrepreneur. This\n          was my business, these were my customers, and\n\n                                        -3-\n\f              I took full responsibility for that. And as\n              such, I would put in the amount of time\n              necessary to keep my customers happy as if\n              they were my business.\n\nVerizon's only substantive restriction on CAM 3s such as Palmieri\n\nwas that they were required to visit with existing customers at\n\nleast once per quarter.\n\n              For his efforts at Verizon, Palmieri was handsomely\n\nrewarded.      Each year that he worked as a CAM 3, he earned a base\n\nsalary that ranged between $55,000 and $65,000.                  In addition, he\n\nearned    sales    commissions.         When    his     base   salary   and   sales\n\ncommissions       were    combined,    he      earned    $101,515.28    in    1998,\n\n$95,127.67 in 1999, $103,361.09 in 2000, $77,022.27 in 2001, and\n\n$33,164.22 for the first five months of 2002.\n\n              In 1998, Verizon had merged with Bell Atlantic, another\n\ntelecommunications company.           As a result, a number of service and\n\nimplementation positions at Verizon were eliminated.                     Palmieri\n\nthereafter received increased post-sale service implementation\n\nresponsibilities.         He was also assigned a number of accounts,\n\noriginally sold by other CAM 3s, that had chronic service problems.\n\nMany     of   these      accounts     provided     Palmieri      with   no    sales\n\nopportunities, as the companies had already made it clear that they\n\nhad no intention of making further purchases from Verizon.                    With\n\nthese changes, Palmieri found that seventy percent of his daily\n\nactivities     related     to   customer      service    problems.      Moreover,\n\nPalmieri was forced to remain in the office to deal with these\n\n                                        -4-\n\fissues, as this was the only means by which he could receive calls\n\nfrom customers and make calls to Verizon's Network Operations\n\nCenter, the company's nerve center for resolving service-related\n\nissues.\n\n          Palmieri was not happy with this turn of events and\n\ncomplained   to   his   superiors   that    with   this   new   emphasis   on\n\ncustomer-service issues, he did not have enough time for sales.\n\nThis had little effect, however.      Furthermore, in 2002, Palmieri's\n\nsales quota was increased from $1 million to $5 million.           This too\n\ndispleased him, as he thought that such a quota could not possibly\n\nbe met.   After all, his module of accounts had never supported\n\nsales in excess of $1 million.            The changes eventually became\n\noverwhelming for Palmieri, and in May 2002, he took a leave of\n\nabsence from Verizon.     In August 2002, he was fired.\n\n          Approximately two years later, on June 7, 2004, Palmieri\n\nfiled this lawsuit in Maine state court.           His complaint contained\n\nfour counts.   Count I sought unpaid overtime wages pursuant to the\n\nfederal Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\"), 29 U.S.C. § 207.           Count\n\nII alleged a violation of the Maine Prompt Pay Act, Me. Rev. Stat.\n\nAnn. tit. 26, § 626.        Count III sought unpaid overtime wages\n\npursuant to Maine law, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 26, §§ 664(3) and\n\n670.   Count IV, finally, alleged spoliation of evidence.             On or\n\nabout July 1, 2004, Verizon, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1446, filed a\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fnotice of removal to have the proceedings removed to the United\n\nStates District Court for the District of Maine.\n\n           In federal court, the case was referred to United States\n\nMagistrate Judge David M. Cohen.   Following the close of discovery\n\non January 18, 2005, Verizon moved for summary judgment on each of\n\nPalmieri's claims.    Palmieri opposed summary judgment only with\n\nrespect to Count I (the FLSA claim) and Count III (the Maine\n\novertime claim).\n\n           Judge Cohen, in a thorough and well-reasoned opinion,\n\nrecommended that summary judgment be granted for Verizon on all\n\nclaims.    The district court adopted this recommendation and on\n\nApril 22, 2005 granted summary judgment for Verizon.        In this\n\nappeal, Palmieri contests only the district court's resolution of\n\nhis claim for overtime pay under Maine law.\n\n                          II.   Discussion\n\n           We review the district court's entry of summary judgment\n\nde novo.   Cordero-Soto v. Island Fin., Inc., 418 F.3d 114, 118 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).    \"In conducting such review, we examine the summary\n\njudgment record in the light most friendly to the summary judgment\n\nloser, and we indulge all reasonable inferences in that party's\n\nfavor.\"    National Amusements v. Town of Dedham, 43 F.3d 731, 735\n\n(1st Cir. 1995).\n\n           Palmieri argues here that the district court incorrectly\n\nfound that he was not entitled to overtime under Maine law.      In\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fevaluating this claim, we note that the key statutory provision is\n\nMe. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 26, § 663(3)(C), which states that\n\n\"[e]mployees whose earnings are derived in whole or in part from\n\nsales commissions and whose hours and places of employment are not\n\nsubstantially controlled by the employer\" are not entitled to\n\novertime pay.    Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 26, § 663(3)(C) (2005) (the\n\nso-called \"sales commission\" exemption).\n\n          There has never been any question in this case that\n\nPalmieri's earnings were derived, at least in part, from sales\n\ncommissions.    As discussed above, Palmieri received a base salary\n\nof $55,000 to $65,000 during the time he worked as a CAM 3, and his\n\nincome was supplemented each year with the money that he earned\n\nthrough sales commissions.      The district court found that Verizon\n\npaid Palmieri $101,515.28 in 1998, $95,127.67 in 1999, $103,361.09\n\nin 2000, $77,022.27 in 2001, and $33,164.22 for the first five\n\nmonths of 2002.    The difference between these figures and the base\n\nsalary was the result of sales commissions that Palmieri had\n\nearned.\n\n          What is, and has been, at issue is whether Verizon\n\nsubstantially     controlled   the   hours   and   places   of   Palmieri's\n\nemployment.     In the proceedings below, Palmieri, to support his\n\nclaim that the company had indeed exerted substantial control over\n\nhis hours and places of employment, pointed to how the nature of\n\nhis job changed after Verizon's merger with Bell Atlantic in 1998.\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fInstead of working as he had as a sales representative responsible\n\nfor selling new products and services to potential clients, he\n\nfound that his primary function following the merger was ensuring\n\nthat service was delivered to Verizon's customers. He asserts that\n\nby forcing him to handle additional service matters that required\n\nhim to stay in the office, the company substantially controlled the\n\nhours and places of his employment.1   As a result, he argues that\n\nhe does not fall within the terms of the exemption and should have\n\nreceived overtime pay.2\n\n          The district court rejected this argument, noting that\n\nthe Maine statute only raises the question of whether the employer\n\nsubstantially controlled the employee's hours and places of work.\n\nIt did not raise the question of whether the employer adopted\n\npolicies or made assignments that substantially influenced the\n\n\n1\n  As we already noted in our recitation of the facts, Palmieri had\nargued that staying in the office was the only means by which he\ncould receive calls from customers and make calls to Verizon's\nNetwork Operations Center. We find it incredible that a company\nsuch as Verizon -- one that bases its entire business on high\ntechnology -- would fail to make use of that technology and permit\nits sales representatives to make the maximum use of their time by\nallowing them to field service inquiries while they were off-site\nattempting to make sales. Nevertheless, the district court found,\nin a finding of fact, that Palmieri was forced to remain in the\noffice   to  deal   efficiently   with  customer-service   issues.\nTherefore, we accept Palmieri's contention as true for purposes of\nreviewing the district court's decision.\n2\n   We note that there is no allegation here that the employer\nimposed new duties that it knew would have the effect of\ncontrolling the employee's time, but avoided doing so expressly in\norder to evade the overtime law.     The issues raised by such an\nallegation are entirely different, and we do not address them here.\n\n                               -8-\n\fmanner in which the employee could conduct business (including\n\nhours and work locations).             Given this difference, and given\n\nPalmieri's resulting failure to demonstrate that Verizon had, in\n\nfact,   substantially     controlled      the   hours    and    places   of   his\n\nemployment, the district court held that Palmieri fell within the\n\nterms of the exemption and was not entitled to overtime pay.\n\n              In this appeal, Palmieri advances the same argument he\n\nmade below and claims that the district court erred in finding that\n\nhis   hours     and   places    of   employment   were    not    substantially\n\ncontrolled by his employer.          For a number of reasons, we think that\n\nthe district court made the correct decision.\n\n              First, we do not believe that there was any \"substantial\n\ncontrol\" by Verizon.           In addressing this issue, we first must\n\nconsider the proper method of interpreting Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit.\n\n26, § 663(3)(C), the Maine law at issue here.            Verizon argues that\n\nwe should look only at the plain text of the statute.                Palmieri,\n\nhowever, believes that we should look beyond the plain text and\n\nexplore the purposes behind the statutory provision by examining\n\nother sources of information such as legislative history and\n\nanalogous federal statutes, regulations, and case law.3\n\n              We have consistently held that when the plain meaning of\n\na statute is clear, we are not to look beyond that text to discern\n\n\n\n3\n   Both parties note that no court has yet interpreted Me. Rev.\nStat. Ann. tit. 26, § 663(3)(C).\n\n                                       -9-\n\flegislative intent.        See, e.g., Bonilla v. Muebles J.J. Álvarez,\n\nInc., 194 F.3d 275, 277 n.2 (1st Cir. 1999) (When \"the plain\n\nmeaning of the statute resolves the issue sub judice, we need not\n\nrummage    through   the   legislative    history   or   search   for   other\n\ninterpretive aids.\").        In the instant case, however, there is a\n\nportion of the Maine statute that contains some ambiguity --\n\nnamely, the words \"substantially controlled.\"            To determine what\n\nthe Maine legislature meant by such a phrase, we are willing to\n\nadopt the approach advocated by Palmieri.           See United States v.\n\nPub. Util. Comm'n of California, 345 U.S. 295, 315 (1953) (\"Where\n\nthe words [of a statute] are ambiguous, the judiciary may properly\n\nuse the legislative history to reach a conclusion.\"); Gordon v.\n\nMaine Cent. R.R., 657 A.2d 785, 786 (Me. 1995) (\"When . . . a term\n\nis not defined in either the relevant statutory provisions or in\n\nprior decisions of this court, Maine courts may look to analogous\n\nfederal statutes, regulations, and case law for guidance.\").\n\n            Looking first to the federal analogue of the Maine law,\n\nthe federal Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. § 207, and in\n\nparticular to the relevant exemption provision, 29 U.S.C. § 213\n\n(a)(1), we see that employees categorized as exempt from the\n\novertime provision of the FLSA include \"any employee employed . . .\n\nin the capacity of an outside salesman (as such term is defined and\n\ndelimited from time to time by regulations of the Secretary [of\n\nLabor].\"    29 U.S.C. § 213(a)(1).       Turning then to the regulations\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fin effect during the relevant time frame to determine what is meant\n\nby an \"outside salesman,\" we learn that an \"outside salesman\" is\n\ncharacterized solely by the relative percentages of time that he\n\nspends on sales and other work.    See 29 C.F.R. § 541.5 (2002).   The\n\ndegree of control by the employer is a non-factor in determining\n\nwhether someone is exempt.   Therefore, the examination of similar\n\nfederal legislation does little to help us determine the precise\n\nmeaning of the Maine statute.4\n\n           The legislative history of the Maine statute itself is\n\nalso of limited assistance. Although Palmieri, in his reply brief,\n\ntraces in detail the evolution of the language in the statute over\n\nthe years, see Reply Brief of Appellant 5-6, his discussion does\n\nnot shed light on what the Maine legislature might have meant by\n\nits use of the phrase \"substantially controlled.\"\n\n           Thus, although we have adopted the approach to statutory\n\ninterpretation advocated by Palmieri, we do not find it to be\n\nhelpful.   We therefore find ourselves compelled to rely on the\n\nplain meaning of the statutory language to determine whether, in\n\nfact, Verizon \"substantially controlled\" the hours and places of\n\nPalmieri's employment.\n\n\n\n\n4\n  The district court agreed, noting that \"the substance of Maine's\nsales exemption differs significantly enough from that of its\nclosest analogue (the federal outside-sales exemption [in 29 U.S.C.\n§ 213(a)(1)] that federal regulations and caselaw are not helpful\nin construing it.\"\n\n                                  -11-\n\f            Maine's basic rules of statutory interpretation require\n\nthat words in a statute be given \"their plain, common, and ordinary\n\nmeaning.\"    Butterfield v. Norfolk & Dedham Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 860\n\nA.2d 861, 862 (Me. 2004).      \"Control,\" the verb in the statute,\n\nmeans \"to exercise restraining or directing influence over\" or \"to\n\nhave   power     over.\"      Merriam-Webster      Online       Dictionary,\n\nhttp://www.m-w.com.       \"Substantially,\"     the    adverb     modifying\n\n\"control,\"   means   \"considerable   in   quantity\"   or   \"significantly\n\ngreat.\"   Id.5\n\n            Using these definitions as a guide, we simply do not see\n\nhow Verizon's oversight of Palmieri can be deemed \"substantial\n\ncontrol.\"    This was not a case where Verizon told Palmieri that he\n\nhad to be at his desk every day for a set number of hours in order\n\n\n5\n   We wish to emphasize the Maine legislature's use of the word\n\"substantially.\"    In his brief, Palmieri points to two other\nstates, Washington and California, that incorporate the element of\n\"control\" in any determination of whether an employee is exempt\nfrom receiving overtime pay.     As Verizon correctly points out,\nhowever, these statutes differ from the Maine statute at issue in\nthis case. Although the Washington and California statutes mention\n\"control,\" they do not contain the word \"substantially\" to modify\n\"control.\" The Washington statute uses the phrase \"no control,\"\nthus tightly restricting the applicability of the exemption. See\nWash. Admin. Code 296-128-540 (\"where . . . the employer has no\ncontrol over the total number of hours worked\"). The California\nprovision contains no modifier whatsoever. See 8 Cal. Code Regs.\n§ 11010(2)(G) (\"subject to the control of their employer\"). These\ndifferences are not without consequence. See Mertens v. Hewitt\nAssocs., 508 U.S. 248, 258 (1993) (\"We will not read the statute to\nrender the modifier superfluous.\"); United States v. Nordic\nVillage, Inc., 503 U.S. 30, 36 (1992) (declining to adopt a\nconstruction that would violate the \"settled rule that a statute\nmust, if possible, be construed in such fashion that every word has\nsome operative effect\").\n\n                                 -12-\n\fto answer service-related calls from customers.        Rather than being\n\n\"substantially controlled,\" he was given substantial latitude to\n\nwork as he saw fit.     He saw himself as an \"entrepreneur\" and noted\n\nthat he put in the amount of time necessary to keep customers\n\nhappy.     Furthermore, he admitted that Verizon placed few controls\n\nover his places of work.     This hardly sounds to us like a person\n\nwho has his hours and places of employment controlled by the\n\nemployer, let alone \"substantially\" controlled.\n\n            To be sure, Verizon's decision to impose upon Palmieri\n\nadditional     service-related     responsibilities        may   well   have\n\ninfluenced the manner in which Palmieri could conduct business\n\n(including hours and work locations).       It may have required him to\n\ncome to the office more frequently to check if anyone called.            If\n\na customer did call with a problem, he would have to stay and deal\n\nwith it.    If, however, no one called, he could leave as he saw fit\n\nand work on sales.     The point is that he was not required by his\n\nemployer to sit at his desk every day and wait for customers to\n\ncall.    He had substantial freedom each day to structure his hours\n\nand places of employment.        Although he may have had less freedom\n\nthan before the Bell Atlantic merger to structure his day, he still\n\nwas not under the substantial control of his employer.                  The\n\ndistrict court was therefore correct in stating that although\n\nPalmieri's choices were impacted and circumscribed by Verizon's\n\nassignments,     the   company    plainly   cannot    be    said   to   have\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\fsubstantially controlled his hours and places of work for purposes\n\nof § 663(3)(C).\n\n          What     undergirds   this    holding     is   our      belief     that\n\n\"substantially    controlled\"   within    the    meaning     of     the   statute\n\nrequires more specific direction on hours and places of employment\n\nthan was the case here.   A contrary holding -- one in which we were\n\nto agree with Palmieri and find that Verizon in this instance did\n\nprovide enough direction on hours and places of employment such\n\nthat Palmieri had his hours and places of employment \"substantially\n\ncontrolled\" for the purposes of the statute -- could lead to\n\nunworkable situations in which temporary assignments of new tasks\n\ncould move employees into and out of exempt status for brief\n\nperiods of time.    If \"substantially controlled\" covered more than\n\nwhat is explicitly required by the employer, claims could be made\n\nat any time that a special, temporary work assignment made it\n\ninconvenient or impossible for an employee to maintain the level of\n\nhis usual commission-based workload and effectively, though not\n\nexplicitly, required \"attendance\" during given days and hours.                 It\n\nseems to us that drawing lines based on percentages of \"effective\"\n\ncontrol is wholly untenable.         In the absence of any legislative\n\ninsight, we believe that it makes sense to confine the reach of\n\n\"substantially    controlled\"   to     those    situations     in    which    the\n\nemployer actually articulates specified work hours and locations.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\f             The second, and related, reason we believe the district\n\ncourt was correct is the ample record evidence that it was not the\n\nemployer that was controlling Palmieri's \"hours and places of\n\nemployment\" (as is required by the statute), but rather Palmieri\n\nhimself who was in control.      Although Palmieri spent a great deal\n\nof   time    on   service-related   issues,   there   are   a   number    of\n\nindications that this emphasis was by choice.          For example, the\n\ndistrict court found that \"Palmieri played an active role in\n\nservice-related issues and was more deeply involved than other\n\nCAMs.\"      If Palmieri was doing more in the customer-service arena\n\nthan what was expected of CAM 3s, a jury would have to conclude\n\nthat such \"extra\" work was by choice and was not imposed upon him\n\nby Verizon.\n\n             The court also found that \"Palmieri tried to maintain his\n\nrelationships with his customers by providing good service.\"             This\n\ndesire to \"maintain relationships\" was, without a doubt, tied to\n\nPalmieri's sales responsibilities and stemmed from the goal of\n\nmaking additional sales to customers and earning additional sales\n\ncommissions.      To counter the suggestion that he focused on service\n\nissues by choice because he had something to gain, Palmieri notes\n\nthat providing good service would have had no effect on sales\n\nrelationships in a number of his accounts (e.g., Public Service of\n\nNew Hampshire, Desktek, and Laconia Savings Bank), because these\n\ncompanies had already made clear their intent not to purchase\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\fadditional products or services from Verizon.          Attention to such\n\nservice-related accounts, he contends, was forced upon him by\n\nVerizon.\n\n            Palmieri's attempt to negate the significance of the time\n\nhe allocated to customer service falls short, however, because even\n\nif there were a number of accounts where he had no sales prospects,\n\nhe did have other accounts in which sales were possible and where\n\nhis emphasis on service issues would have gone a long way toward\n\nhelping    him   maintain   these   account   relationships   and   earning\n\nadditional sales commissions.          Thus, Palmieri's time spent on\n\nservice-related issues does not mean that the company exerted\n\ncontrol over him but was meaningful evidence of his own desire to\n\nmaintain and even expand the accounts.\n\n            Third,    we     are     persuaded    by    Palmieri's      own\n\ncharacterization of the summary judgment calculus. Palmieri frames\n\nthe issue posed by summary judgment as whether there was any\n\nprospect of sales.     But, by his own admission, he spent at least\n\ntwenty percent of his time making sales, and a substantial portion\n\nof his income each year came from the commissions earned as a\n\nresult of those sales.        Clearly, then, there was at least some\n\nprospect of Palmieri making sales. Thus, there remained no genuine\n\nissue of material fact as to whether Palmieri had any prospect of\n\nmaking sales.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\f          For these three reasons, we think that the district court\n\nwas correct in holding that there was no triable issue as to the\n\nsubstantiality of Verizon's control over Palmieri's hours and\n\nplaces of employment, and that summary judgment on Palmieri's state\n\nlaw claim was proper.     Since we uphold the district court's\n\ndetermination that Palmieri was not entitled to overtime pay under\n\nthe \"sales commission\" exemption under Maine law, we need not reach\n\nVerizon's alternative argument that Palmieri is also exempt under\n\nMaine's so-called \"administrative\" exemption.   See Me. Rev. Stat.\n\nAnn. tit. 26, § 663(3)(K) (2005).\n\n                         III.   Conclusion\n\n          For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the order of\n\nthe district court.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -17-\n\f",

Palmieri (\"Palmieri\") brought suit against his former employer, defendant-appellee Nynex Long Distance Co. d/b/a Verizon Enterprise Solutions (\"Verizon\"), claiming that he was eligible for overtime pay for his work at the company. The district court granted summary judgment for Verizon, and Palmieri here contests this decision. After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Facts</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For nearly fifteen years, Palmieri worked for Verizon, a large telecommunications vendor, and its corporate predecessors. During his time at the company, he rose through the ranks and in 1997 attained the position of \"Account Manager,\" later renamed \"Corporate Account Manager 3\" (\"CAM 3\"). This is one of the highest level sales positions at Verizon. Palmieri held this position until his employment was terminated in August 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a CAM 3 working out of Verizon's office in Portland, Maine, Palmieri sold products and services associated with high-speed voice and data networks. He was expected to deal only with a limited number of large customers. In particular, he was assigned a module of 20 to 50 large customer accounts. He was not permitted to call on customers who were not within his assigned module. This meant that he needed to make repeat sales to the same customers in his module.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To accomplish this, he had quarterly meetings, or \"planning sessions,\" with his customers. In these meetings, the customers would state their general needs and goals, and Palmieri would attempt to sell solutions to satisfy them. Palmieri also entertained the customers in his module by taking them to lunch or dinner, to Red Sox games, or to shows at the Wang Theater in Boston. This was done so that Palmieri could maintain his relationships and position himself well to make repeat sales to the customers in his module.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To handle the difficulties associated with making sales to large, institutional customers, Verizon provided CAM 3s such as Palmieri with a great deal of institutional support. For example, the company maintained a multi-tiered account team to address customer-service issues. This team provided technical and administrative support, so that the CAM 3s could focus their efforts on sales.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Verizon also gave Palmieri and other CAM 3s tremendous freedom in their daily routines. Palmieri, for example, was responsible for all parts of the sales transactions, including face-to-face client meetings, contract negotiations, and the signing of sales contracts. He and other CAM 3s also were permitted to set their own schedules based on their customers. When asked about his schedule, Palmieri testified as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I approached my job as an entrepreneur. This was my business, these were my customers, and I took full responsibility for that. And as such, I would put in the amount of time necessary to keep my customers happy as if they were my business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Verizon's only substantive restriction on CAM 3s such as Palmieri was that they were required to visit with existing customers at least once per quarter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For his efforts at Verizon, Palmieri was handsomely rewarded. Each year that he worked as a CAM 3, he earned a base salary that ranged between $55,000 and $65,000. In addition, he earned sales commissions. When his base salary and sales commissions were combined, he earned $101,515.28 in 1998, $95,127.67 in 1999, $103,361.09 in 2000, $77,022.27 in 2001, and $33,164.22 for the first five months of 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1998, Verizon had merged with Bell Atlantic, another telecommunications company. As a result, a number of service and implementation positions at Verizon were eliminated. Palmieri thereafter received increased post-sale service implementation responsibilities. He was also assigned a number of accounts, originally sold by other CAM 3s, that had chronic service problems. Many of these accounts provided Palmieri with no sales opportunities, as the companies had already made it clear that they had no intention of making further purchases from Verizon. With these changes, Palmieri found that seventy percent of his daily activities related to customer service problems. Moreover, Palmieri was forced to remain in the office to deal with these issues, as this was the only means by which he could receive calls from customers and make calls to Verizon's Network Operations Center, the company's nerve center for resolving service-related issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Palmieri was not happy with this turn of events and complained to his superiors that with this new emphasis on customer-service issues, he did not have enough time for sales. This had little effect, however. Furthermore, in 2002, Palmieri's sales quota was increased from $1 million to $5 million. This too displeased him, as he thought that such a quota could not possibly be met. After all, his module of accounts had never supported sales in excess of $1 million. The changes eventually became overwhelming for Palmieri, and in May 2002, he took a leave of absence from Verizon. In August 2002, he was fired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approximately two years later, on June 7, 2004, Palmieri filed this lawsuit in Maine state court. His complaint contained four counts. Count I sought unpaid overtime wages pursuant to the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\"), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 207. Count II alleged a violation of the Maine Prompt Pay Act, Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 26, &#167; 626. Count III sought unpaid overtime wages pursuant to Maine law, Me.Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 26, &#167;&#167; 664(3) and 670. Count IV, finally, alleged spoliation of evidence. On or about July 1, 2004, Verizon, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1446, filed a notice of removal to have the proceedings removed to the United States District Court for the District of Maine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In federal court, the case was referred to United States Magistrate Judge David M. Cohen. Following the close of discovery on January 18, 2005, Verizon moved for summary judgment on each of Palmieri's claims. Palmieri opposed summary judgment only with respect to Count I (the FLSA claim) and Count III (the Maine overtime claim).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Cohen, in a thorough and well-reasoned opinion, recommended that summary judgment be granted for Verizon on all claims. The district court adopted this recommendation and on April 22, 2005 granted summary judgment for Verizon. In this appeal, Palmieri contests only the district court's resolution of his claim for overtime pay under Maine law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Discussion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's entry of summary judgment <i>de novo. Cordero-Soto v. Island Fin., Inc.,</i> 418 F.3d 114, 118 (1st Cir.2005). \"In conducting such review, we examine the summary judgment record in the light most friendly to the summary judgment loser, and we indulge all reasonable inferences in that party's favor.\" <i>National Amusements v. Town of Dedham,</i> 43 F.3d 731, 735 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Palmieri argues here that the district court incorrectly found that he was not entitled to overtime under Maine law. In evaluating this claim, we note that the key statutory provision is Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 26, &#167; 663(3)(C), which states that \"[e]mployees whose earnings are derived in whole or in part from sales commissions and whose hours and places of employment are not substantially controlled by the employer\" are not entitled to overtime pay. Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 26, &#167; 663(3)(C) (2005) (the so-called \"sales commission\" exemption).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There has never been any question in this case that Palmieri's earnings were derived, at least in part, from sales commissions. As discussed above, Palmieri received a base salary of $55,000 to $65,000 during the time he worked as a CAM 3, and his income was supplemented each year with the money that he earned through sales commissions. The district court found that Verizon paid Palmieri $101,515.28 in 1998, $95,127.67 in 1999, $103,361.09 in 2000, $77,022.27 in 2001, and $33,164.22 for the first five months of 2002. The difference between these figures and the base salary was the result of sales commissions that Palmieri had earned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What is, and has been, at issue is whether Verizon substantially controlled the hours and places of Palmieri's employment. In the proceedings below, Palmieri, to support his claim that the company had indeed exerted substantial control over his hours and places of employment, pointed to how the nature of his job changed after Verizon's merger with Bell Atlantic in 1998. Instead of working as he had as a sales representative responsible for selling new products and services to potential clients, he found that his primary function following the merger was ensuring that service was delivered to Verizon's customers. He asserts that by forcing him to handle additional service matters that required him to stay in the office, the company substantially controlled the hours and places of his employment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> As a result, he argues that he does not fall within the terms of the exemption and should have received overtime pay.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected this argument, noting that the Maine statute only raises the question of whether the employer substantially controlled the employee's hours and places of work. It did not raise the question of whether the employer adopted policies or made assignments that substantially influenced the manner in which the employee could conduct business (including hours and work locations). Given this difference, and given Palmieri's resulting failure to demonstrate that Verizon had, in fact, substantially controlled the hours and places of his employment, the district court held that Palmieri fell within the terms of the exemption and was not entitled to overtime pay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this appeal, Palmieri advances the same argument he made below and claims that the district court erred in finding that his hours and places of employment were not substantially controlled by his employer. For a number of reasons, we think that the district court made the correct decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, we do not believe that there was any \"substantial control\" by Verizon. In addressing this issue, we first must consider the proper method of interpreting Me. Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 26, &#167; 663(3)(C), the Maine law at issue here. Verizon argues that we should look only at the plain text of the statute. Palmieri, however, believes that we should look beyond the plain text and explore the purposes behind the statutory provision by examining other sources of information such as legislative history and analogous federal statutes, regulations, and case law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have consistently held that when the plain meaning of a statute is clear, we are not to look beyond that text to discern legislative intent. <i>See, e.g., Bonilla v. Muebles J.J. &#193;lvarez, Inc.,</i> 194 F.3d 275, 277 n. 2 (1st Cir.1999) (When \"the plain meaning of the statute resolves the issue <i>sub judice,</i> we need not rummage through the legislative history or search for other interpretive aids.\"). In the instant case, however, there is a portion of the Maine statute that contains some ambiguity &#8212; namely, the words \"substantially controlled.\" To determine what the Maine legislature meant by such a phrase, we are willing to adopt the approach advocated by Palmieri. <i>See United States v. Pub. Util. Comm'n of California,</i> 345 U.S. 295, 315, 73 S.Ct. 706, 97 L.Ed. 1020 (1953) (\"Where the words [of a statute] are ambiguous, the judiciary may properly use the legislative history to reach a conclusion.\"); <i>Gordon v. Maine Cent. R.R.,</i> 657 A.2d 785, 786 (Me. 1995) (\"When ... a term is not defined in either the relevant statutory provisions or in prior decisions of this court, Maine courts may look to analogous federal statutes, regulations, and case law for guidance.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Looking first to the federal analogue of the Maine law, the federal Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 207, and in particular to the relevant exemption provision, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 213(a)(1), we see that employees categorized as exempt from the overtime provision of the FLSA include \"any employee employed ... in the capacity of an outside salesman (as such term is defined and delimited from time to time by regulations of the Secretary [of Labor]).\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 213(a)(1). Turning then to the regulations in effect during the relevant time frame to determine what is meant by an \"outside salesman,\" we learn that an \"outside salesman\" is characterized solely by the relative percentages of time that he spends on sales and other work. <i>See</i> 29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.5 (2002). The degree of control by the employer is a non-factor in determining whether someone is exempt. Therefore, the examination of similar federal legislation does little to help us determine the precise meaning of the Maine statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative history of the Maine statute itself is also of limited assistance. Although Palmieri, in his reply brief, traces in detail the evolution of the language in the statute over the years, <i>see</i> Reply Brief of Appellant 5-6, his discussion does not shed light on what the Maine legislature might have meant by its use of the phrase \"substantially controlled.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, although we have adopted the approach to statutory interpretation advocated by Palmieri, we do not find it to be helpful. We therefore find ourselves compelled to rely on the plain meaning of the statutory language to determine whether, in fact, Verizon \"substantially controlled\" the hours and places of Palmieri's employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maine's basic rules of statutory interpretation require that words in a statute be given \"their plain, common, and ordinary meaning.\" <i>Butterfield v. Norfolk &amp; Dedham Mut. Fire Ins. Co.,</i> 860 A.2d 861, 862 (Me.2004). \"Control,\" the verb in the statute, means \"to exercise restraining or directing influence over\" or \"to have power over.\" Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, <i>http://www.m-w.com.</i> \"Substantially,\" the adverb modifying \"control,\" means \"considerable in quantity\" or \"significantly great.\" <i>Id.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Using these definitions as a guide, we simply do not see how Verizon's oversight of Palmieri can be deemed \"substantial control.\" This was not a case where Verizon told Palmieri that he had to be at his desk every day for a set number of hours in order to answer service-related calls from customers. Rather than being \"substantially controlled,\" he was given substantial latitude to work as he saw fit. He saw himself as an \"entrepreneur\" and noted that he put in the amount of time necessary to keep customers happy. Furthermore, he admitted that Verizon placed few controls over his places of work. This hardly sounds to us like a person who has his hours and places of employment controlled by the employer, let alone \"substantially\" controlled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, Verizon's decision to impose upon Palmieri additional service-related responsibilities may well have influenced the manner in which Palmieri could conduct business (including hours and work locations). It may have required him to come to the office more frequently to check if anyone called. If a customer did call with a problem, he would have to stay and deal with it. If, however, no one called, he could leave as he saw fit and work on sales. The point is that he was not required by his employer to sit at his desk every day and wait for customers to call. He had substantial freedom each day to structure his hours and places of employment. Although he may have had less freedom than before the Bell Atlantic merger to structure his day, he still was not under the substantial control of his employer. The district court was therefore correct in stating that although Palmieri's choices were impacted and circumscribed by Verizon's assignments, the company plainly cannot be said to have substantially controlled his hours and places of work for purposes of &#167; 663(3)(C).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What undergirds this holding is our belief that \"substantially controlled\" within the meaning of the statute requires more specific direction on hours and places of employment than was the case here. A contrary holding &#8212; one in which we were to agree with Palmieri and find that Verizon in this instance did provide enough direction on hours and places of employment such that Palmieri had his hours and places of employment \"substantially controlled\" for the purposes of the statute &#8212; could lead to unworkable situations in which temporary assignments of new tasks could move employees into and out of exempt status for brief periods of time. If \"substantially controlled\" covered more than what is <i>explicitly</i> required by the employer, claims could be made at any time that a special, temporary work assignment made it inconvenient or impossible for an employee to maintain the level of his usual commission-based workload and effectively, though not explicitly, required \"attendance\" during given days and hours. It seems to us that drawing lines based on percentages of \"effective\" control is wholly untenable. In the absence of any legislative insight, we believe that it makes sense to confine the reach of \"substantially controlled\" to those situations in which the employer actually articulates specified work hours and locations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second, and related, reason we believe the district court was correct is the ample record evidence that it was not the <i>employer</i> that was controlling Palmieri's \"hours and places of employment\" (as is required by the statute), but rather <i>Palmieri</i> himself who was in control. Although Palmieri spent a great deal of time on service-related issues, there are a number of indications that this emphasis was by choice. For example, the district court found that \"Palmieri played an active role in service-related issues and was more deeply involved than other CAMs.\" If Palmieri was doing more in the customer-service arena than what was expected of CAM 3s, a jury would have to conclude that such \"extra\" work was by choice and was not imposed upon him by Verizon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also found that \"Palmieri tried to maintain his relationships with his customers by providing good service.\" This desire to \"maintain relationships\" was, without a doubt, tied to Palmieri's sales responsibilities and stemmed from the goal of making additional sales to customers and earning additional sales commissions. To counter the suggestion that he focused on service issues by choice because he had something to gain, Palmieri notes that providing good service would have had no effect on sales relationships in a number of his accounts (e.g., Public Service of New Hampshire, Desktek, and Laconia Savings Bank), because these companies had already made clear their intent not to purchase additional products or services from Verizon. Attention to such service-related accounts, he contends, was forced upon him by Verizon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Palmieri's attempt to negate the significance of the time he allocated to customer service falls short, however, because even if there were a number of accounts where he had no sales prospects, he did have other accounts in which sales were possible and where his emphasis on service issues would have gone a long way toward helping him maintain these account relationships and earning additional sales commissions. Thus, Palmieri's time spent on service-related issues does not mean that the company exerted control over him but was meaningful evidence of his own desire to maintain and even expand the accounts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, we are persuaded by Palmieri's own characterization of the summary judgment calculus. Palmieri frames the issue posed by summary judgment as whether there was <i>any</i> prospect of sales. But, by his own admission, he spent at least twenty percent of his time making sales, and a substantial portion of his income each year came from the commissions earned as a result of those sales. Clearly, then, there was at least some prospect of Palmieri making sales. Thus, there remained no genuine issue of material fact as to whether Palmieri had <i>any</i> prospect of making sales.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these three reasons, we think that the district court was correct in holding that there was no triable issue as to the substantiality of Verizon's control over Palmieri's hours and places of employment, and that summary judgment on Palmieri's state law claim was proper. Since we uphold the district court's determination that Palmieri was not entitled to overtime pay under the \"sales commission\" exemption under Maine law, we need not reach Verizon's alternative argument that Palmieri is also exempt under Maine's so-called \"administrative\" exemption. <i>See</i> Me.Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 26, &#167; 663(3)(K) (2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the order of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> As we already noted in our recitation of the facts, Palmieri had argued that staying in the office was the only means by which he could receive calls from customers and make calls to Verizon's Network Operations Center. We find it incredible that a company such as Verizon &#8212; one that bases its entire business on high technology &#8212; would fail to make use of that technology and permit its sales representatives to make the maximum use of their time by allowing them to field service inquiries while they were off-site attempting to make sales. Nevertheless, the district court found, in a finding of fact, that Palmieri was forced to remain in the office to deal efficiently with customer-service issues. Therefore, we accept Palmieri's contention as true for purposes of reviewing the district court's decision</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We note that there is no allegation here that the employer imposed new duties that it knew would have the effect of controlling the employee's time, but avoided doing so expressly in order to evade the overtime law. The issues raised by such an allegation are entirely different, and we do not address them here</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Both parties note that no court has yet interpreted Me.Rev.Stat.

As Verizon correctly points out, however, these statutes differ from the Maine statute at issue in this case. Although the Washington and California statutes mention \"control,\" they do not contain the word \"substantially\" to modify \"control.\" The Washington statute uses the phrase \"no control,\" thus tightly restricting the applicability of the exemption<i>See</i> Wash. Admin. Code 296-128-540 (\"where ... the employer has no control over the total number of hours worked\"). The California provision contains no modifier whatsoever. <i>See</i> 8 Cal.Code Regs. &#167; 11010(2)(G) (\"subject to the control of their employer\"). These differences are not without consequence. <i>See Mertens v.

Palmieri (\"Palmieri\") brought suit against his former employer, defendant-appellee Nynex Long Distance Co. d/b/a Verizon Enterprise Solutions (\"Verizon\"), claiming that he was eligible for overtime pay for his work at the company. The district court granted summary judgment for Verizon, and Palmieri here contests this decision. After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Facts</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For nearly fifteen years, Palmieri worked for Verizon, a large telecommunications vendor, and its corporate predecessors. During his time at the company, he rose through the ranks and in 1997 attained the position of \"Account Manager,\" later renamed \"Corporate Account Manager 3\" (\"CAM 3\"). This is one of the highest level sales positions at Verizon. Palmieri held this position until his employment was terminated in August 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a CAM 3 working out of Verizon's office in Portland, Maine, Palmieri sold products and services associated with high-speed voice and data networks. He was expected to deal only with a limited number of large customers. In particular, he was assigned a module of 20 to 50 large customer accounts. He was not permitted to call on customers who were not within his assigned module. This meant that he needed to make repeat sales to the same customers in his module.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To accomplish this, he had quarterly meetings, or \"planning sessions,\" with his customers. In these meetings, the customers would state their general needs and goals, and Palmieri would attempt to sell solutions to satisfy them. Palmieri also entertained the customers in his module by taking them to lunch or dinner, to Red Sox games, or to shows at the Wang Theater in Boston. This was done so that Palmieri could maintain his relationships and position himself well to make repeat sales to the customers in his module.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To handle the difficulties associated with making sales to large, institutional customers, Verizon provided CAM 3s such as Palmieri with a great deal of institutional support. For example, the company maintained a multi-tiered account team to address customer-service issues. This team provided technical and administrative support, so that the CAM 3s could focus their efforts on sales.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Verizon also gave Palmieri and other CAM 3s tremendous freedom in their daily routines. Palmieri, for example, was responsible for all parts of the sales transactions, including face-to-face client meetings, contract negotiations, and the signing of sales contracts. He and other CAM 3s also were permitted to set their own schedules based on their customers. When asked about his schedule, Palmieri testified as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I approached my job as an entrepreneur. This was my business, these were my customers, and I took full responsibility for that. And as such, I would put in the amount of time necessary to keep my customers happy as if they were my business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Verizon's only substantive restriction on CAM 3s such as Palmieri was that they were required to visit with existing customers at least once per quarter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For his efforts at Verizon, Palmieri was handsomely rewarded. Each year that he worked as a CAM 3, he earned a base salary that ranged between $55,000 and $65,000. In addition, he earned sales commissions. When his base salary and sales commissions were combined, he earned $101,515.28 in 1998, $95,127.67 in 1999, $103,361.09 in 2000, $77,022.27 in 2001, and $33,164.22 for the first five months of 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1998, Verizon had merged with Bell Atlantic, another telecommunications company. As a result, a number of service and implementation positions at Verizon were eliminated. Palmieri thereafter received increased post-sale service implementation responsibilities. He was also assigned a number of accounts, originally sold by other CAM 3s, that had chronic service problems. Many of these accounts provided Palmieri with no sales opportunities, as the companies had already made it clear that they had no intention of making further purchases from Verizon. With these changes, Palmieri found that seventy percent of his daily activities related to customer service problems. Moreover, Palmieri was forced to remain in the office to deal with these issues, as this was the only means by which he could receive calls from customers and make calls to Verizon's Network Operations Center, the company's nerve center for resolving service-related issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Palmieri was not happy with this turn of events and complained to his superiors that with this new emphasis on customer-service issues, he did not have enough time for sales. This had little effect, however. Furthermore, in 2002, Palmieri's sales quota was increased from $1 million to $5 million. This too displeased him, as he thought that such a quota could not possibly be met. After all, his module of accounts had never supported sales in excess of $1 million. The changes eventually became overwhelming for Palmieri, and in May 2002, he took a leave of absence from Verizon. In August 2002, he was fired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approximately two years later, on June 7, 2004, Palmieri filed this lawsuit in Maine state court. His complaint contained four counts. Count I sought unpaid overtime wages pursuant to the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\"), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 207. Count II alleged a violation of the Maine Prompt Pay Act, Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 26, &#167; 626. Count III sought unpaid overtime wages pursuant to Maine law, Me.Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 26, &#167;&#167; 664(3) and 670. Count IV, finally, alleged spoliation of evidence. On or about July 1, 2004, Verizon, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1446, filed a notice of removal to have the proceedings removed to the United States District Court for the District of Maine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In federal court, the case was referred to United States Magistrate Judge David M. Cohen. Following the close of discovery on January 18, 2005, Verizon moved for summary judgment on each of Palmieri's claims. Palmieri opposed summary judgment only with respect to Count I (the FLSA claim) and Count III (the Maine overtime claim).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Cohen, in a thorough and well-reasoned opinion, recommended that summary judgment be granted for Verizon on all claims. The district court adopted this recommendation and on April 22, 2005 granted summary judgment for Verizon. In this appeal, Palmieri contests only the district court's resolution of his claim for overtime pay under Maine law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Discussion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's entry of summary judgment <i>de novo.

In evaluating this claim, we note that the key statutory provision is Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 26, &#167; 663(3)(C), which states that \"[e]mployees whose earnings are derived in whole or in part from sales commissions and whose hours and places of employment are not substantially controlled by the employer\" are not entitled to overtime pay. Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 26, &#167; 663(3)(C) (2005) (the so-called \"sales commission\" exemption).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There has never been any question in this case that Palmieri's earnings were derived, at least in part, from sales commissions. As discussed above, Palmieri received a base salary of $55,000 to $65,000 during the time he worked as a CAM 3, and his income was supplemented each year with the money that he earned through sales commissions. The district court found that Verizon paid Palmieri $101,515.28 in 1998, $95,127.67 in 1999, $103,361.09 in 2000, $77,022.27 in 2001, and $33,164.22 for the first five months of 2002. The difference between these figures and the base salary was the result of sales commissions that Palmieri had earned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What is, and has been, at issue is whether Verizon substantially controlled the hours and places of Palmieri's employment. In the proceedings below, Palmieri, to support his claim that the company had indeed exerted substantial control over his hours and places of employment, pointed to how the nature of his job changed after Verizon's merger with Bell Atlantic in 1998. Instead of working as he had as a sales representative responsible for selling new products and services to potential clients, he found that his primary function following the merger was ensuring that service was delivered to Verizon's customers. He asserts that by forcing him to handle additional service matters that required him to stay in the office, the company substantially controlled the hours and places of his employment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> As a result, he argues that he does not fall within the terms of the exemption and should have received overtime pay.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected this argument, noting that the Maine statute only raises the question of whether the employer substantially controlled the employee's hours and places of work. It did not raise the question of whether the employer adopted policies or made assignments that substantially influenced the manner in which the employee could conduct business (including hours and work locations). Given this difference, and given Palmieri's resulting failure to demonstrate that Verizon had, in fact, substantially controlled the hours and places of his employment, the district court held that Palmieri fell within the terms of the exemption and was not entitled to overtime pay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this appeal, Palmieri advances the same argument he made below and claims that the district court erred in finding that his hours and places of employment were not substantially controlled by his employer. For a number of reasons, we think that the district court made the correct decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, we do not believe that there was any \"substantial control\" by Verizon. In addressing this issue, we first must consider the proper method of interpreting Me. Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 26, &#167; 663(3)(C), the Maine law at issue here. Verizon argues that we should look only at the plain text of the statute. Palmieri, however, believes that we should look beyond the plain text and explore the purposes behind the statutory provision by examining other sources of information such as legislative history and analogous federal statutes, regulations, and case law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have consistently held that when the plain meaning of a statute is clear, we are not to look beyond that text to discern legislative intent. <i>See, e.g., Bonilla v. Muebles J.J. &#193;lvarez, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198699\"><a href=\"/opinion/198699/bonilla-v-muebles/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">275</span></a></span>, 277 n. 2 (1st Cir.1999) (When \"the plain meaning of the statute resolves the issue <i>sub judice,</i> we need not rummage through the legislative history or search for other interpretive aids.\"). In the instant case, however, there is a portion of the Maine statute that contains some ambiguity &#8212; namely, the words \"substantially controlled.\" To determine what the Maine legislature meant by such a phrase, we are willing to adopt the approach advocated by Palmieri. <i>See United States v. Pub. Util. Comm'n of California,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105109\"><a href=\"/opinion/105109/united-states-v-public-utilities-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">345</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">295</span></a></span>, 315, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105109\"><a href=\"/opinion/105109/united-states-v-public-utilities-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Turning then to the regulations in effect during the relevant time frame to determine what is meant by an \"outside salesman,\" we learn that an \"outside salesman\" is characterized solely by the relative percentages of time that he spends on sales and other work. <i>See</i> 29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.5 (2002). The degree of control by the employer is a non-factor in determining whether someone is exempt. Therefore, the examination of similar federal legislation does little to help us determine the precise meaning of the Maine statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative history of the Maine statute itself is also of limited assistance. Although Palmieri, in his reply brief, traces in detail the evolution of the language in the statute over the years, <i>see</i> Reply Brief of Appellant 5-6, his discussion does not shed light on what the Maine legislature might have meant by its use of the phrase \"substantially controlled.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, although we have adopted the approach to statutory interpretation advocated by Palmieri, we do not find it to be helpful. We therefore find ourselves compelled to rely on the plain meaning of the statutory language to determine whether, in fact, Verizon \"substantially controlled\" the hours and places of Palmieri's employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maine's basic rules of statutory interpretation require that words in a statute be given \"their plain, common, and ordinary meaning.\" <i>Butterfield v. Norfolk &amp; Dedham Mut. Fire Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">860</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">861</span></span>, 862 (Me.2004). \"Control,\" the verb in the statute, means \"to exercise restraining or directing influence over\" or \"to have power over.\" Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, <i>http://www.m-w.com.</i> \"Substantially,\" the adverb modifying \"control,\" means \"considerable in quantity\" or \"significantly great.\" <i>Id.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Using these definitions as a guide, we simply do not see how Verizon's oversight of Palmieri can be deemed \"substantial control.\" This was not a case where Verizon told Palmieri that he had to be at his desk every day for a set number of hours in order to answer service-related calls from customers. Rather than being \"substantially controlled,\" he was given substantial latitude to work as he saw fit. He saw himself as an \"entrepreneur\" and noted that he put in the amount of time necessary to keep customers happy. Furthermore, he admitted that Verizon placed few controls over his places of work. This hardly sounds to us like a person who has his hours and places of employment controlled by the employer, let alone \"substantially\" controlled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, Verizon's decision to impose upon Palmieri additional service-related responsibilities may well have influenced the manner in which Palmieri could conduct business (including hours and work locations). It may have required him to come to the office more frequently to check if anyone called. If a customer did call with a problem, he would have to stay and deal with it. If, however, no one called, he could leave as he saw fit and work on sales. The point is that he was not required by his employer to sit at his desk every day and wait for customers to call. He had substantial freedom each day to structure his hours and places of employment. Although he may have had less freedom than before the Bell Atlantic merger to structure his day, he still was not under the substantial control of his employer. The district court was therefore correct in stating that although Palmieri's choices were impacted and circumscribed by Verizon's assignments, the company plainly cannot be said to have substantially controlled his hours and places of work for purposes of &#167; 663(3)(C).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What undergirds this holding is our belief that \"substantially controlled\" within the meaning of the statute requires more specific direction on hours and places of employment than was the case here. A contrary holding &#8212; one in which we were to agree with Palmieri and find that Verizon in this instance did provide enough direction on hours and places of employment such that Palmieri had his hours and places of employment \"substantially controlled\" for the purposes of the statute &#8212; could lead to unworkable situations in which temporary assignments of new tasks could move employees into and out of exempt status for brief periods of time. If \"substantially controlled\" covered more than what is <i>explicitly</i> required by the employer, claims could be made at any time that a special, temporary work assignment made it inconvenient or impossible for an employee to maintain the level of his usual commission-based workload and effectively, though not explicitly, required \"attendance\" during given days and hours. It seems to us that drawing lines based on percentages of \"effective\" control is wholly untenable. In the absence of any legislative insight, we believe that it makes sense to confine the reach of \"substantially controlled\" to those situations in which the employer actually articulates specified work hours and locations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second, and related, reason we believe the district court was correct is the ample record evidence that it was not the <i>employer</i> that was controlling Palmieri's \"hours and places of employment\" (as is required by the statute), but rather <i>Palmieri</i> himself who was in control. Although Palmieri spent a great deal of time on service-related issues, there are a number of indications that this emphasis was by choice. For example, the district court found that \"Palmieri played an active role in service-related issues and was more deeply involved than other CAMs.\" If Palmieri was doing more in the customer-service arena than what was expected of CAM 3s, a jury would have to conclude that such \"extra\" work was by choice and was not imposed upon him by Verizon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also found that \"Palmieri tried to maintain his relationships with his customers by providing good service.\" This desire to \"maintain relationships\" was, without a doubt, tied to Palmieri's sales responsibilities and stemmed from the goal of making additional sales to customers and earning additional sales commissions. To counter the suggestion that he focused on service issues by choice because he had something to gain, Palmieri notes that providing good service would have had no effect on sales relationships in a number of his accounts (e.g., Public Service of New Hampshire, Desktek, and Laconia Savings Bank), because these companies had already made clear their intent not to purchase additional products or services from Verizon. Attention to such service-related accounts, he contends, was forced upon him by Verizon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Palmieri's attempt to negate the significance of the time he allocated to customer service falls short, however, because even if there were a number of accounts where he had no sales prospects, he did have other accounts in which sales were possible and where his emphasis on service issues would have gone a long way toward helping him maintain these account relationships and earning additional sales commissions. Thus, Palmieri's time spent on service-related issues does not mean that the company exerted control over him but was meaningful evidence of his own desire to maintain and even expand the accounts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, we are persuaded by Palmieri's own characterization of the summary judgment calculus. Palmieri frames the issue posed by summary judgment as whether there was <i>any</i> prospect of sales. But, by his own admission, he spent at least twenty percent of his time making sales, and a substantial portion of his income each year came from the commissions earned as a result of those sales. Clearly, then, there was at least some prospect of Palmieri making sales. Thus, there remained no genuine issue of material fact as to whether Palmieri had <i>any</i> prospect of making sales.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these three reasons, we think that the district court was correct in holding that there was no triable issue as to the substantiality of Verizon's control over Palmieri's hours and places of employment, and that summary judgment on Palmieri's state law claim was proper. Since we uphold the district court's determination that Palmieri was not entitled to overtime pay under the \"sales commission\" exemption under Maine law, we need not reach Verizon's alternative argument that Palmieri is also exempt under Maine's so-called \"administrative\" exemption. <i>See</i> Me.Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 26, &#167; 663(3)(K) (2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the order of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> As we already noted in our recitation of the facts, Palmieri had argued that staying in the office was the only means by which he could receive calls from customers and make calls to Verizon's Network Operations Center. We find it incredible that a company such as Verizon &#8212; one that bases its entire business on high technology &#8212; would fail to make use of that technology and permit its sales representatives to make the maximum use of their time by allowing them to field service inquiries while they were off-site attempting to make sales. Nevertheless, the district court found, in a finding of fact, that Palmieri was forced to remain in the office to deal efficiently with customer-service issues. Therefore, we accept Palmieri's contention as true for purposes of reviewing the district court's decision</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We note that there is no allegation here that the employer imposed new duties that it knew would have the effect of controlling the employee's time, but avoided doing so expressly in order to evade the overtime law. The issues raised by such an allegation are entirely different, and we do not address them here</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Both parties note that no court has yet interpreted Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 26, &#167; 663(3)(C)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The district court agreed, noting that \"the substance of Maine's sales exemption differs significantly enough from that of its closest analogue (the federal outside-sales exemption [in 29 U.S.C. &#167; 213(a)(1)]) that federal regulations and caselaw are not helpful in construing it.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> We wish to emphasize the Maine legislature's use of the word \"substantially.\" In his brief, Palmieri points to two other states, Washington and California, that incorporate the element of \"control\" in any determination of whether an employee is exempt from receiving overtime pay. As Verizon correctly points out, however, these statutes differ from the Maine statute at issue in this case. Although the Washington and California statutes mention \"control,\" they do not contain the word \"substantially\" to modify \"control.\" The Washington statute uses the phrase \"no control,\" thus tightly restricting the applicability of the exemption<i>See</i> Wash. Admin. Code 296-128-540 (\"where ... the employer has no control over the total number of hours worked\"). The California provision contains no modifier whatsoever. <i>See</i> 8 Cal.Code Regs. &#167; 11010(2)(G) (\"subject to the control of their employer\").
