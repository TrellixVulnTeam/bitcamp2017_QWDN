Patti B. Saris, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                          Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                     Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                       and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     David G.

After Robert Marrama filed for\n\nChapter 7 bankruptcy protection, Citizens Bank contended that\n\nMarrama should be denied a discharge because he recently had\n\ntransferred      assets    to   defraud    his     creditors.     See     11   U.S.C.\n\nยง 727(a)(2)(A). The bankruptcy court entered summary judgement for\n\nthe bank.    Marrama appealed to the district court, which sustained\n\nthe bankruptcy court's judgment.               On Marrama's further appeal, we\n\ntoo conclude that summary judgment was appropriate and affirm.\n\n                                          I.\n\n            We review the facts in the light most favorable to\n\nMarrama,    the   non-movant      in   the      summary    judgment   proceedings.\n\nMedeiros v. Vincent, 431 F.3d 25, 29 (1st Cir. 2005).1                   Before his\n\nbankruptcy       filing,    Marrama       owned      RLM     Flooring,     a    small\n\nMassachusetts company that sold and installed flooring products.\n\nRLM Flooring maintained a line of credit with Citizens Bank, which\n\nMarrama    had    guaranteed     personally.          When    Marrama's    flooring\n\nbusiness ran into problems, Citizens demanded repayment of the line\n\nof credit -- roughly $255,000 -- in June 2002.                  Two weeks later,\n\nCitizens commenced a Massachusetts state court collection action.\n\nIn August, the state court granted Citizens the authority to seize\n\nRLM Flooring and sell its assets.                 At the same time, that court\n\n\n     1\n       We also narrated facts relating to this case in our previous\nopinion affirming the bankruptcy court's finding that Marrama's\n\"bad faith\" warranted the court's refusal to allow him to convert\nhis petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection into a Chapter 13\ncase. See In re Marrama, 430 F.3d 474 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                                          -2-\n\falso ordered Marrama not to dispose of any personal assets except\n\nto   pay   for    his   normal    living   expenses.       Citizens     liquidated\n\nMarrama's flooring business, but sale of the company's assets\n\nfailed to satisfy the bank's claim.\n\n             Meanwhile, Marrama made some unusual personal financial\n\ntransactions.       In July 2002, Marrama refinanced a vacation home he\n\nowned in York, Maine.        In connection with the refinancing, Marrama\n\nreceived $118,000 in cash.              He deposited these proceeds into a\n\nMaine bank account he held jointly with his girlfriend, Josephine\n\nBolleterio.        From the joint account, he withdrew approximately\n\n$8,000, which he told the trustee that he used, at least in part,\n\nto   pay    certain     personal    and    business      creditors.       Then    he\n\ntransferred       roughly    $109,000      into     an   account      standing    in\n\nBolleterio's name alone, leaving only a small sum in the joint\n\naccount.     In late August 2002 -- after the Massachusetts court\n\nordered him not to transfer any assets -- Marrama used the York\n\nproperty to fund \"the Bo-Mar Realty Trust,\" a spendthrift trust of\n\nwhich Bolleterio is the trustee.           The York home is the trust's only\n\nasset,     and    Marrama   is   its    only     beneficiary.      Marrama   later\n\ntestified that he placed the home into the trust to \"try to protect\n\nit.\"\n\n             In    March    2003,      Marrama    petitioned    for     Chapter    7\n\nbankruptcy protection.           On forms and schedules he filed with his\n\nbankruptcy petition, Marrama disclosed his beneficial interest in\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fthe Bo-Mar trust but stated, under penalty of perjury, that he had\n\nnot transferred any assets during the previous year. Marrama later\n\ntermed his failure to disclose the transfer of the York home a\n\nscrivener's error.        Marrama does not point to anything in the\n\nrecord suggesting an excuse for his failure to disclose his deposit\n\nof the refinancing proceeds into Bolleterio's solo account.\n\n            Citizens soon filed a bankruptcy court adversary action\n\nto deny Marrama a discharge.       The bank contended that Marrama had\n\nforfeited his right to a discharge by transferring the York home to\n\nthe trust; by transferring the refinancing proceeds to Bolleterio;\n\nand by transferring $40,000 to the lawyer who represented him in\n\nstate court,2 also less than a year before his petition for\n\nbankruptcy protection. Any of these allegedly fraudulent transfers\n\ncould constitute an independent ground for denying Marrama a\n\ndischarge, pursuant to ยง 727(a)(2)(A).3\n\n            Contentious proceedings followed.           Citizens demanded\n\ndiscovery    testimony    from   Marrama.     Marrama     answered   certain\n\ninquiries    from   the   bankruptcy    trustee.   But,    in   reaction   to\n\n\n\n     2\n         Marrama is represented by a different lawyer in this action.\n     3\n       The bank leveled other accusations as well. Altogether, its\ncomplaint against Marrama included nine counts, including one that\nalleged Marrama's \"commission of Bankruptcy Crimes for making false\noaths and withholding records.\" The bankruptcy court relied on the\nfraudulent transfer issue in granting summary judgment to the bank.\nBecause a fraudulent transfer is a sufficient ground for denying\nMarrama a discharge, we need not reach Marrama's objections about\nthe other counts of Citizens's complaint.\n\n                                       -4-\n\fCitizens's insistent complaints about his \"bankruptcy crimes,\"\n\nMarrama   cited   the    Fifth   Amendment   and   refused   to   respond   to\n\nCitizens's questions about the transfers to the trust, Bolleterio,\n\nand his lawyer.\n\n           The    bankruptcy     court   granted   the   bank's   motion    for\n\nsummary judgment.       Ruling from the bench, the court concluded:\n\n           [T]he bank has certainly made a prima facie\n           case that . . . disclosures were not made that\n           should have been made, that transfers were\n           made that should have been reported.       All\n           these things are set out in the motion for\n           summary judgment, and if standing alone with\n           no opposition would certainly justify the\n           granting of summary judgment and the denial of\n           Marrama's discharge.\n\n                  One of the problems here is that the\n           defendant debtor is in the unenviable position\n           of wishing to claim the Fifth Amendment and\n           defending against a motion for summary\n           judgment.   Now he claims that the bank is\n           unable to give proof of evidence that he\n           intended to defraud, but at the same time he\n           claims that the bank is not prejudiced. But\n           there's no way to find out his intent if he's\n           claiming the Fifth because he won't tell us\n           what his intent was. Indeed, I can and will\n           draw a negative inference from the fact that\n           he is standing mute when it comes to these\n           matters which are civil and not criminal.\n\n                  When I come to the response to the\n           motion for summary [judgment], which I\n           permitted to be filed in open court today, and\n           I look over it, I don't find anything that\n           contradicts the assertions made in the bank's\n           moving papers to the extent that they are\n           necessary for me to grant summary judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f            Marrama's appeal to the district court focused on the\n\nbankruptcy court's determination that it could draw a negative\n\ninference,       in    summary      judgment      proceedings,         from   Marrama's\n\ninvocation       of    the    Fifth      Amendment     in    adversarial      discovery\n\nproceedings.           Marrama      argued     that     such    an     inference     was\n\ninconsistent with the maxim that, on summary judgment, inferences\n\nare drawn in favor of the non-movant.                       The district court was\n\nunconvinced by Marrama's argument but concluded that, even without\n\nany negative inference, the record warranted summary judgment for\n\nthe bank.\n\n                                            II.\n\n            On     further      appeal,      Marrama    again     claims      that   the\n\nbankruptcy       court       drew   an    impermissible        inference      from   his\n\ninvocation of his Fifth Amendment rights.                    Marrama admits that he\n\ntransferred property less than one year before his bankruptcy\n\npetition.        He contends only that, without an inference drawn\n\nagainst   him,        the    summary     judgment    record     does    not   permit   a\n\nconclusion that Marrama intended to defraud his creditors when he\n\nmade the transfers.\n\n             We have recognized that four elements are required to\n\ndeny a discharge pursuant to ยง 727(a)(2)(A): (1) transfer or\n\nconcealment of property (2) that belonged to the debtor (3) less\n\nthan a year before the bankruptcy petition (4) with actual intent\n\nto hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor.                    See In re Schifano, 378\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\fF.3d 60, 66-67 (1st Cir. 2004).          Because a debtor rarely gives\n\ndirect evidence of fraudulent intent, we have recognized that, even\n\non summary judgment, intent to defraud a creditor can be proved by\n\ncircumstantial evidence. See In re Varrasso, 37 F.3d 760, 764 (1st\n\nCir. 1994).       In weighing evidence of fraudulent intent courts\n\nshould look to the following \"objective indicia\":\n\n            (1) insider relationships between the parties;\n            (2) the retention of possession, benefit or\n            use of the property in question; (3) the lack\n            or inadequacy of consideration for the\n            transfer; (4) the financial condition of the\n            [debtor] both before and after the transaction\n            at issue; (5) the existence or cumulative\n            effect   of   the   pattern   or   series   of\n            transactions or course of conduct after the\n            incurring of the debt, onset of financial\n            difficulties, or pendency or threat of suits\n            by creditors; (6) the general chronology of\n            the events and transactions under inquiry; and\n            (7) an attempt by the debtor to keep the\n            transfer a secret.\n\nIn re Watman, 301 F.3d 3, 8 (1st Cir. 2002) (internal citations\n\nomitted).\n\n            Evidence of fraud is conclusive enough to support summary\n\njudgment in a ยง 727(a)(2)(A) action when it yields no plausible\n\nconclusion but that the debtor's intent was fraudulent.         See In re\n\nVarrasso, 37 F.3d at 764 (\"[I]n certain cases, circumstantial\n\nevidence may be sufficiently potent to establish fraudulent intent\n\nbeyond hope of contradiction.\"). In the face of such evidence, the\n\ndebtor   hoping    to   resist   summary    judgment   cannot   rest   on\n\n\"'conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fspeculation.'\"     Id. (quoting Medina-Munoz v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco\n\nCo., 896 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 1990)).\n\n             We acknowledge our reservations about the bankruptcy\n\ncourt's decision to draw a negative inference against Marrama, at\n\nthe summary judgment stage, on the basis of his invocation of a\n\nFifth Amendment privilege.          It is clear that the bankruptcy court\n\ncan draw an inference at trial from a party's invocation of a Fifth\n\nAmendment privilege, see In re Carp, 340 F.3d 15, 23 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).   But we have expressed doubt as to whether a court can draw\n\nthe   same   inference   at   the    summary   judgment    stage,   where   all\n\nreasonable inferences must be drawn for the non-movant.                     See\n\nMulero-Rodrรญguez v. Ponte, Inc., 98 F.3d 670, 678 (1st Cir. 1996)\n\n(explaining that a party's invocation of the Fifth Amendment in\n\ndiscovery does not alter requirement that inferences be drawn in\n\nfavor of summary judgment non-movant); see also United States v.\n\n4003-4005 5th Ave., 55 F.3d 78, 83 (2d Cir. 1995) (noting that\n\ninvocation    of   the   Fifth   Amendment     privilege    does    not   alter\n\nevidentiary burdens (citing United States v. Rylander, 460 U.S. 752\n\n(1983)); LaSalle Bank Lake View v. Seguban, 54 F.3d 387, 389-94\n\n(7th Cir. 1995) (holding that non-movant's invocation of the Fifth\n\nAmendment privilege does not free the summary judgment movant from\n\nshowing that the evidence in the record requires judgment as a\n\nmatter of law).\n\n\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\f           We need not determine here whether the bankruptcy court's\n\ninference constituted error.         Our standard of review in this case\n\nis de novo.    In re Spookyworld, Inc., 346 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).   We are in the same position as the bankruptcy court and can\n\naffirm a grant of summary judgment \"on any independently sufficient\n\nground\" in the record.      Mesnick v. General Elec. Co, 950 F.2d 816,\n\n822 (1st Cir. 1991).       We draw no inference from Marrama's silence\n\nbut still see no issue of material fact that precludes summary\n\njudgment. We also note one other difference between the bankruptcy\n\ncourt's analysis and our own.        While the bankruptcy court appears\n\nto have looked generally at Marrama's course of conduct in granting\n\nsummary judgment, we focus specifically on Marrama's transfer of\n\nhis York vacation home to the Bo-Mar trust and his deposit of over\n\n$100,000 into an account under the sole control of his girlfriend.\n\n           The summary judgment record includes Marrama's direct\n\nadmission that he had transferred his vacation home \"to protect\n\nit,\" and several circumstantial badges of fraud.               As for the\n\ntransfer to the trust:        Marrama acted in direct violation of a\n\nstate court order that he not dispose of any assets except to pay\n\nfor normal living expenses; Marrama transferred the property to a\n\nspendthrift   trust,   a    device    designed   to   shield   assets   from\n\ncreditors;4 Marrama attempted to retain his right to use his\n\n\n     4\n       \"A spendthrift trust is defined as one created to provide a\nfund for a beneficiary and at the same time secure it against his\nimprovidence or incapacity. It is an active trust with provision\n\n                                      -9-\n\fvacation home by making himself the sole beneficiary of his new\n\nspendthrift trust; and Marrama failed to include the transfer in\n\nthe papers accompanying his bankruptcy petition.                 As for the\n\ndeposit of the refinancing proceeds into Bolleterio's account:\n\nMarrama admits that he continued to have access to the money after\n\nthe transfer; he did not disclose the transfer or any financial\n\ninterest in Bolleterio's account (or the joint account in which the\n\nfunds previously were held) in his bankruptcy papers; the transfer\n\noccurred during a period of financial distress and actual or\n\nimpending litigation; and he had a close relationship with the\n\nperson to whom he made the transfer.\n\n            Marrama notes that he recorded the transfer of the home\n\nto   the   trust   with   the   local   deeds   office,   that   his   lawyer\n\ntestified that the omission of the transfer of the home to the\n\ntrust from the bankruptcy schedules had been his scrivner's error,\n\nand that he disclosed his beneficial interest in the spendthrift\n\ntrust, and its holdings, in the bankruptcy petition.             As for the\n\ntransfer of funds to Bolleterio, Marrama points to his equivocal\n\nstatement that he put the refinancing proceeds in Bolleterio's\n\naccount because having two accounts was unnecessary, and that the\n\nmoney rightfully belonged to Bolleterio as trustee of the Bo-Mar\n\n\n\n\nagainst alienation of the fund or property by voluntary act of the\nbeneficiary or through legal process by creditors.\" Sec. Pac. Bank\nv. Chang, 80 F.3d 1412, 1415 (9th Cir. 1996).\n\n                                    -10-\n\ftrust.5   Also, he argues that Citizens has not proved that the\n\ntransferred property constituted \"all or substantially all\" of his\n\nassets, even though the bankruptcy court has recognized such\n\nevidence as probative of fraudulent intent.         See In re Lang, 246\n\nB.R. 463, 469 n.9 (Bankr. D. Mass.), aff'd 256 B.R. 539 (B.A.P. 1st\n\nCir. 2000).   Marrama argues that this evidence is sufficient to\n\ncreate a triable issue of fact on the question of his intent in\n\nmaking the transfer.\n\n          We disagree. Marrama's argument that the transfer of the\n\nrefinancing proceeds to Bolleterio was warranted because she was\n\nthe trustee of the Bo-Mar trust overlooks the fact that Marrama\n\n\n\n     5\n       This evidence comes from comments Marrama made to the\nbankruptcy trustee about the transfer.   The exchange between\nMarrama and the trustee was as follows:\n\n     The trustee:   Why   did   you   give   [the   money]   to\n     Josephine?\n\n     Marrama: Just um, no reason. No reason to have\n     two accounts, so Josephine you know, was -- I had\n     no reason for it.\n\n     The trustee:   Well, did you give it to her --\n\n     Marrama: Well, Josephine asked, you know -- even\n     though she's not on paper with the home and\n     everything she is part, was part of the trust.\n\n     The trustee:   Uh-huh.\n\n     Marrama: Um, I had owed her some money that we had\n     borrowed to -- you know, at different times she had\n     given me money.    But ah, she had asked me about\n     just have her hold the money.

The bankruptcy court entered summary judgement for the bank. Marrama appealed to the district court, which sustained the bankruptcy court's judgment. On Marrama's further appeal, we too conclude that summary judgment was appropriate and affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the facts in the light most favorable to Marrama, the non-movant in the summary judgment proceedings. <i>Medeiros v. Vincent,</i> 431 F.3d 25, 29 (1st Cir.2005).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Before his bankruptcy filing, Marrama owned RLM Flooring, a small Massachusetts company that sold and installed flooring products. RLM Flooring maintained a line of credit with Citizens Bank, which Marrama had guaranteed personally. When Marrama's flooring business ran into problems, Citizens demanded repayment of the line of credit &#8212; roughly $255,000 &#8212; in June 2002. Two weeks later, Citizens commenced a Massachusetts state court collection action. In August, the state court granted Citizens the authority to seize RLM Flooring and sell its assets. At the same time, that court also ordered Marrama not to dispose of any personal assets except to pay for his normal living expenses. Citizens liquidated Marrama's flooring business, but sale of the company's assets failed to satisfy the bank's claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, Marrama made some unusual personal financial transactions. In July 2002, Marrama refinanced a vacation home he owned in York, Maine. In connection with the refinancing, Marrama received $118,000 in cash. He deposited these proceeds into a Maine bank account he held jointly with his girlfriend, Josephine Bolleterio. From the joint account, he withdrew approximately $8,000, which he told the trustee that he used, at least in part, to pay certain personal and business creditors. Then he transferred roughly $109,000 into an account standing in Bolleterio's name alone, leaving only a small sum in the joint account. In late August 2002 &#8212; after the Massachusetts court ordered him not to transfer any assets &#8212; Marrama used the York property to fund \"the Bo-Mar Realty Trust,\" a spendthrift trust of which Bolleterio is the trustee. The York home is the trust's only asset, and Marrama is its only beneficiary. Marrama later testified that he placed the home into the trust to \"try to protect it.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 2003, Marrama petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. On forms and schedules he filed with his bankruptcy petition, Marrama disclosed his beneficial interest in the Bo-Mar trust but stated, under penalty of perjury, that he had not transferred any assets during the previous year. Marrama later termed his failure to disclose the transfer of the York home a scrivener's error. Marrama does not point to anything in the record suggesting an excuse for his failure to disclose his deposit of the refinancing proceeds into Bolleterio's solo account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Citizens soon filed a bankruptcy court adversary action to deny Marrama a discharge. The bank contended that Marrama had forfeited his right to a discharge by transferring the York home to the trust; by transferring the refinancing proceeds to Bolleterio; and by transferring $40,000 to the lawyer who represented him in state court,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> also less than a year before his petition for bankruptcy protection. Any of these allegedly fraudulent transfers could constitute an independent ground for denying Marrama a discharge, pursuant to &#167; 727(a)(2)(A).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contentious proceedings followed. Citizens demanded discovery testimony from Marrama. Marrama answered certain inquiries from the bankruptcy trustee. But, in reaction to Citizens's insistent complaints about his \"bankruptcy crimes,\" Marrama cited the Fifth Amendment and refused to respond to Citizens's questions about the transfers to the trust, Bolleterio, and his lawyer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy court granted the bank's motion for summary judgment. Ruling from the bench, the court concluded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he bank has certainly made a <i>prima facie</i> case that ... disclosures were not made that should have been made, that transfers were made that should have been reported. All these things are set out in the motion for summary judgment, and if standing alone with no opposition would certainly justify the granting of summary judgment and the denial of Marrama's discharge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of the problems here is that the defendant debtor is in the unenviable position of wishing to claim the Fifth Amendment and defending against a motion for summary judgment. Now he claims that the bank is unable to give proof of evidence that he intended to defraud, but at the same time he claims that the bank is not prejudiced. But there's no way to find out his intent if he's claiming the Fifth because he won't tell us what his intent was. Indeed, I can and will draw a negative inference from the fact that he is standing mute when it comes to these matters which are civil and not criminal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When I come to the response to the motion for summary [judgment], which I permitted to be filed in open court today, and I look over it, I don't find anything that contradicts the assertions made in the bank's moving papers to the extent that they are necessary for me to grant summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marrama's appeal to the district court focused on the bankruptcy court's determination that it could draw a negative inference, in summary judgment proceedings, from Marrama's invocation of the Fifth Amendment in adversarial discovery proceedings. Marrama argued that such an inference was inconsistent with the maxim that, on summary judgment, inferences are drawn in favor of the non-movant. The district court was unconvinced by Marrama's argument but concluded that, even without any negative inference, the record warranted summary judgment for the bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On further appeal, Marrama again claims that the bankruptcy court drew an impermissible inference from his invocation of his Fifth Amendment rights. Marrama admits that he transferred property less than one year before his bankruptcy petition. He contends only that, without an inference drawn against him, the summary judgment record does not permit a conclusion that Marrama intended to defraud his creditors when he made the transfers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have recognized that four elements are required to deny a discharge pursuant to &#167; 727(a)(2)(A): (1) transfer or concealment of property (2) that belonged to the debtor (3) less than a year before the bankruptcy petition (4) with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor. <i>See In re Schifano,</i> 378 F.3d 60, 66-67 (1st Cir.2004). Because a debtor rarely gives direct evidence of fraudulent intent, we have recognized that, even on summary judgment, intent to defraud a creditor can be proved by circumstantial evidence. <i>See In re Varrasso,</i> 37 F.3d 760, 764 (1st Cir. 1994). In weighing evidence of fraudulent intent courts should look to the following \"objective indicia\":</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) insider relationships between the parties; (2) the retention of possession, benefit or use of the property in question; (3) the lack or inadequacy of consideration for the transfer; (4) the financial condition of the [debtor] both before and after the transaction at issue; (5) the existence or cumulative effect of the pattern or series of transactions or course of conduct after the incurring of the debt, onset of financial difficulties, or pendency or threat of suits by creditors; (6) the general chronology of the events and transactions under inquiry; and (7) an attempt by the debtor to keep the transfer a secret.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>In re Watman,</i> 301 F.3d 3, 8 (1st Cir.2002) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidence of fraud is conclusive enough to support summary judgment in a &#167; 727(a)(2)(A) action when it yields no plausible conclusion but that the debtor's intent was fraudulent. <i>See In re Varrasso,</i> 37 F.3d at 764 (\"[I]n certain cases, circumstantial evidence may be sufficiently potent to establish fraudulent intent beyond hope of contradiction.\"). In the face of such evidence, the debtor hoping to resist summary judgment cannot rest on \"`conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Medina-Munoz v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.,</i> 896 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir.1990)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We acknowledge our reservations about the bankruptcy court's decision to draw a negative inference against Marrama, at the summary judgment stage, on the basis of his invocation of a Fifth Amendment privilege. It is clear that the bankruptcy court can draw an inference at trial from a party's invocation of a Fifth Amendment privilege, <i>see In re Carp,</i> 340 F.3d 15, 23 (1st Cir.2003). But we have expressed doubt as to whether a court can draw the same inference at the summary judgment stage, where all reasonable inferences must be drawn for the non-movant. <i>See Mulero-Rodr&#237;guez v. Ponte, Inc.,</i> 98 F.3d 670, 678 (1st Cir.1996) (explaining that a party's invocation of the Fifth Amendment in discovery does not alter requirement that inferences be drawn in favor of summary judgment non-movant); <i>see also United States v. 4003-4005 5th Ave.,</i> 55 F.3d 78, 83 (2d Cir.1995) (noting that invocation of the Fifth Amendment privilege does not alter evidentiary burdens) (citing <i>United States v. Rylander,</i> 460 U.S. 752, 103 S.Ct. 1548, 75 L.Ed.2d 521 (1983)); <i>LaSalle Bank Lake View v. Seguban,</i> 54 F.3d 387, 389-94 (7th Cir. 1995) (holding that non-movant's invocation of the Fifth Amendment privilege does not free the summary judgment movant from showing that the evidence in the record requires judgment as a matter of law).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not determine here whether the bankruptcy court's inference constituted error. Our standard of review in this case is <i>de novo. In re Spookyworld, Inc.,</i> 346 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.2003). We are in the same position as the bankruptcy court and can affirm a grant of summary judgment \"on any independently sufficient ground\" in the record. <i>Mesnick v. General Elec. Co.,</i> 950 F.2d 816, 822 (1st Cir.1991). We draw no inference from Marrama's silence but still see no issue of material fact that precludes summary judgment. We also note one other difference between the bankruptcy court's analysis and our own. While the bankruptcy court appears to have looked generally at Marrama's course of conduct in granting summary judgment, we focus specifically on Marrama's transfer of his York vacation home to the Bo-Mar trust and his deposit of over $100,000 into an account under the sole control of his girlfriend.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The summary judgment record includes Marrama's direct admission that he had transferred his vacation home \"to protect it,\" and several circumstantial badges of fraud. As for the transfer to the trust: Marrama acted in direct violation of a state court order that he not dispose of any assets except to pay for normal living expenses; Marrama transferred the property to a spendthrift trust, a device designed to shield assets from creditors;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Marrama attempted to retain his right to use his vacation home by making himself the sole beneficiary of his new spendthrift trust; and Marrama failed to include the transfer in the papers accompanying his bankruptcy petition. As for the deposit of the refinancing proceeds into Bolleterio's account: Marrama admits that he continued to have access to the money after the transfer; he did not disclose the transfer or any financial interest in Bolleterio's account (or the joint account in which the funds previously were held) in his bankruptcy papers; the transfer occurred during a period of financial distress and actual or impending litigation; and he had a close relationship with the person to whom he made the transfer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marrama notes that he recorded the transfer of the home to the trust with the local deeds office, that his lawyer testified that the omission of the transfer of the home to the trust from the bankruptcy schedules had been his scrivner's error, and that he disclosed his beneficial interest in the spendthrift trust, and its holdings, in the bankruptcy petition. As for the transfer of funds to Bolleterio, Marrama points to his equivocal statement that he put the refinancing proceeds in Bolleterio's account because having two accounts was unnecessary, and that the money rightfully belonged to Bolleterio as trustee of the Bo-Mar trust.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Also, he argues that Citizens has not proved that the transferred property constituted \"all or substantially all\" of his assets, even though the bankruptcy court has recognized such evidence as probative of fraudulent intent. <i>See In re Lang,</i> 246 B.R. 463, 469 n. 9 (Bankr. D.Mass.), <i>aff'd</i> 256 B.R. 539 (B.A.P. 1st Cir.2000). Marrama argues that this evidence is sufficient to create a triable issue of fact on the question of his intent in making the transfer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree. Marrama's argument that the transfer of the refinancing proceeds to Bolleterio was warranted because she was the trustee of the Bo-Mar trust overlooks the fact that Marrama deposited the refinancing proceeds on July 29, before the transfer of the home to the trust. The funds belonged to Marrama alone, and he has not presented any legitimate financial explanation for the action other than a desire to let Bolleterio control the money. Although Marrama argues that his payments to creditors with the funds from the refinancing demonstrate that he had no fraudulent intent, Marrama only claims to have used a small portion of the money to pay creditors, and he concealed the funds transferred to Bolleterio when listing his assets. In other words, he continued to have access to and control over the money, and any reasonable finder of fact would be compelled to conclude on the evidence presented that the transfer was motivated at least in part by a desire to keep the funds out of the hands of his creditors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, an array of undisputed facts support nearly every indication of fraudulent intent that we have recognized. Marrama transferred assets to the control of a person with whom he had a confidential relationship; Marrama admits that he retained beneficial interest in the assets; Marrama points to no evidence that he received valuable consideration for his transfer of the refinancing proceeds to Bolleterio; Marrama made the transfers while in financial distress and facing seizure of his assets; the transfers constitute a pattern of hiding assets that should have been subject to the bankruptcy proceeding; at least one of the transfers took place in violation of a state court order; and Marrama attempted to conceal at least his transfer of the refinancing proceeds to Bolleterio. <i>See In re Watman,</i> 301 F.3d at 8; <i>see also In re Marrama,</i> 430 F.3d at 482 (\"The instant case comports in all material respects with the classic profile of playing fast and loose with the bankruptcy process.\"); <i>In re Lang,</i> 246 B.R. at 470 (noting \"common fact pattern seen in &#167; 727(a)(2)(A) cases\" of a debtor who \"transfers property to a family member or close friend but retains the control or enjoyment of the transferred assets\"). To boot, Marrama admitted that he had transferred his vacation home to the trust in order to \"protect it,\" an inescapable reference to protection from his creditors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is only one reasonable inference that can be drawn from this record: that Marrama transferred valuable assets belonging to him, less than a year before he petitioned for bankruptcy protection, with the actual intent to defraud his creditors. <i>See In re Schifano,</i> 378 F.3d at 66-67. The bankruptcy court correctly granted summary judgment, and the district court correctly upheld that disposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We also narrated facts relating to this case in our previous opinion affirming the bankruptcy court's finding that Marrama's \"bad faith\" warranted the court's refusal to allow him to convert his petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection into a Chapter 13 case<i>See In re Marrama,</i> 430 F.3d 474 (1st Cir. 2005).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Marrama is represented by a different lawyer in this action</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The bank leveled other accusations as well. Altogether, its complaint against Marrama included nine counts, including one that alleged Marrama's \"commission of Bankruptcy Crimes for making false oaths and withholding records.\" The bankruptcy court relied on the fraudulent transfer issue in granting summary judgment to the bank.

Vincent,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201955\"><a href=\"/opinion/201955/medeiros-v-atlantic-states-mari/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 29 (1st Cir.2005).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Before his bankruptcy filing, Marrama owned RLM Flooring, a small Massachusetts company that sold and installed flooring products. RLM Flooring maintained a line of credit with Citizens Bank, which Marrama had guaranteed personally. When Marrama's flooring business ran into problems, Citizens demanded repayment of the line of credit &#8212; roughly $255,000 &#8212; in June 2002. Two weeks later, Citizens commenced a Massachusetts state court collection action. In August, the state court granted Citizens the authority to seize RLM Flooring and sell its assets. At the same time, that court also ordered Marrama not to dispose of any personal assets except to pay for his normal living expenses. Citizens liquidated Marrama's flooring business, but sale of the company's assets failed to satisfy the bank's claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, Marrama made some unusual personal financial transactions. In July 2002, Marrama refinanced a vacation home he owned in York, Maine. In connection with the refinancing, Marrama received $118,000 in cash. He deposited these proceeds into a Maine bank account he held jointly with his girlfriend, Josephine Bolleterio. From the joint account, he withdrew approximately $8,000, which he told the trustee that he used, at least in part, to pay certain personal and business creditors. Then he transferred roughly $109,000 into an account standing in Bolleterio's name alone, leaving only a small sum in the joint account. In late August 2002 &#8212; after the Massachusetts court ordered him not to transfer any assets &#8212; Marrama used the York property to fund \"the Bo-Mar Realty Trust,\" a spendthrift trust of which Bolleterio is the trustee. The York home is the trust's only asset, and Marrama is its only beneficiary. Marrama later testified that he placed the home into the trust to \"try to protect it.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 2003, Marrama petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. On forms and schedules he filed with his bankruptcy petition, Marrama disclosed his beneficial interest in the Bo-Mar trust but stated, under penalty of perjury, that he had not transferred any assets during the previous year. Marrama later termed his failure to disclose the transfer of the York home a scrivener's error. Marrama does not point to anything in the record suggesting an excuse for his failure to disclose his deposit of the refinancing proceeds into Bolleterio's solo account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Citizens soon filed a bankruptcy court adversary action to deny Marrama a discharge. The bank contended that Marrama had forfeited his right to a discharge by transferring the York home to the trust; by transferring the refinancing proceeds to Bolleterio; and by transferring $40,000 to the lawyer who represented him in state court,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> also less than a year before his petition for bankruptcy protection. Any of these allegedly fraudulent transfers could constitute an independent ground for denying Marrama a discharge, pursuant to &#167; 727(a)(2)(A).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contentious proceedings followed. Citizens demanded discovery testimony from Marrama. Marrama answered certain inquiries from the bankruptcy trustee. But, in reaction to Citizens's insistent complaints about his \"bankruptcy crimes,\" Marrama cited the Fifth Amendment and refused to respond to Citizens's questions about the transfers to the trust, Bolleterio, and his lawyer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy court granted the bank's motion for summary judgment. Ruling from the bench, the court concluded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he bank has certainly made a <i>prima facie</i> case that ... disclosures were not made that should have been made, that transfers were made that should have been reported. All these things are set out in the motion for summary judgment, and if standing alone with no opposition would certainly justify the granting of summary judgment and the denial of Marrama's discharge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of the problems here is that the defendant debtor is in the unenviable position of wishing to claim the Fifth Amendment and defending against a motion for summary judgment. Now he claims that the bank is unable to give proof of evidence that he intended to defraud, but at the same time he claims that the bank is not prejudiced. But there's no way to find out his intent if he's claiming the Fifth because he won't tell us what his intent was. Indeed, I can and will draw a negative inference from the fact that he is standing mute when it comes to these matters which are civil and not criminal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When I come to the response to the motion for summary [judgment], which I permitted to be filed in open court today, and I look over it, I don't find anything that contradicts the assertions made in the bank's moving papers to the extent that they are necessary for me to grant summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marrama's appeal to the district court focused on the bankruptcy court's determination that it could draw a negative inference, in summary judgment proceedings, from Marrama's invocation of the Fifth Amendment in adversarial discovery proceedings. Marrama argued that such an inference was inconsistent with the maxim that, on summary judgment, inferences are drawn in favor of the non-movant. The district court was unconvinced by Marrama's argument but concluded that, even without any negative inference, the record warranted summary judgment for the bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On further appeal, Marrama again claims that the bankruptcy court drew an impermissible inference from his invocation of his Fifth Amendment rights. Marrama admits that he transferred property less than one year before his bankruptcy petition. He contends only that, without an inference drawn against him, the summary judgment record does not permit a conclusion that Marrama intended to defraud his creditors when he made the transfers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have recognized that four elements are required to deny a discharge pursuant to &#167; 727(a)(2)(A): (1) transfer or concealment of property (2) that belonged to the debtor (3) less than a year before the bankruptcy petition (4) with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor. <i>See In re Schifano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"787191\"><a href=\"/opinion/787191/in-re-frank-schifano-debtor-alfred-razzaboni-and-henry-razzaboni-v-frank/\"><span class=\"volume\">378</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span>, 66-67 (1st Cir.2004). Because a debtor rarely gives direct evidence of fraudulent intent, we have recognized that, even on summary judgment, intent to defraud a creditor can be proved by circumstantial evidence. <i>See In re Varrasso,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195673\"><a href=\"/opinion/195673/varrasso-v-desmond/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">760</span></a></span>, 764 (1st Cir. 1994).

In the face of such evidence, the debtor hoping to resist summary judgment cannot rest on \"`conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Medina-Munoz v.

It is clear that the bankruptcy court can draw an inference at trial from a party's invocation of a Fifth Amendment privilege, <i>see In re Carp,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">340</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></span>, 23 (1st Cir.2003). But we have expressed doubt as to whether a court can draw the same inference at the summary judgment stage, where all reasonable inferences must be drawn for the non-movant. <i>See Mulero-Rodr&#237;guez v.

Our standard of review in this case is <i>de novo. In re Spookyworld, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200665\"><a href=\"/opinion/200665/spookyworld-inc-v-town-of-berlin/\"><span class=\"volume\">346</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir.2003). We are in the same position as the bankruptcy court and can affirm a grant of summary judgment \"on any independently sufficient ground\" in the record. <i>Mesnick v. General Elec. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573068\"><a href=\"/opinion/573068/samuel-mesnick-v-general-electric-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">816</span></a></span>, 822 (1st Cir.1991). We draw no inference from Marrama's silence but still see no issue of material fact that precludes summary judgment. We also note one other difference between the bankruptcy court's analysis and our own. While the bankruptcy court appears to have looked generally at Marrama's course of conduct in granting summary judgment, we focus specifically on Marrama's transfer of his York vacation home to the Bo-Mar trust and his deposit of over $100,000 into an account under the sole control of his girlfriend.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The summary judgment record includes Marrama's direct admission that he had transferred his vacation home \"to protect it,\" and several circumstantial badges of fraud. As for the transfer to the trust: Marrama acted in direct violation of a state court order that he not dispose of any assets except to pay for normal living expenses; Marrama transferred the property to a spendthrift trust, a device designed to shield assets from creditors;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Marrama attempted to retain his right to use his vacation home by making himself the sole beneficiary of his new spendthrift trust; and Marrama failed to include the transfer in the papers accompanying his bankruptcy petition. As for the deposit of the refinancing proceeds into Bolleterio's account: Marrama admits that he continued to have access to the money after the transfer; he did not disclose the transfer or any financial interest in Bolleterio's account (or the joint account in which the funds previously were held) in his bankruptcy papers; the transfer occurred during a period of financial distress and actual or impending litigation; and he had a close relationship with the person to whom he made the transfer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marrama notes that he recorded the transfer of the home to the trust with the local deeds office, that his lawyer testified that the omission of the transfer of the home to the trust from the bankruptcy schedules had been his scrivner's error, and that he disclosed his beneficial interest in the spendthrift trust, and its holdings, in the bankruptcy petition. As for the transfer of funds to Bolleterio, Marrama points to his equivocal statement that he put the refinancing proceeds in Bolleterio's account because having two accounts was unnecessary, and that the money rightfully belonged to Bolleterio as trustee of the Bo-Mar trust.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Also, he argues that Citizens has not proved that the transferred property constituted \"all or substantially all\" of his assets, even though the bankruptcy court has recognized such evidence as probative of fraudulent intent. <i>See In re Lang,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1842137\"><a href=\"/opinion/1842137/in-re-lang/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">463</span></a></span>, 469 n. 9 (Bankr. D.Mass.), <i>aff'd</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1549634\"><a href=\"/opinion/1549634/in-re-lang/\"><span class=\"volume\">256</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">539</span></a></span> (B.A.P. 1st Cir.2000). Marrama argues that this evidence is sufficient to create a triable issue of fact on the question of his intent in making the transfer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree. Marrama's argument that the transfer of the refinancing proceeds to Bolleterio was warranted because she was the trustee of the Bo-Mar trust overlooks the fact that Marrama deposited the refinancing proceeds on July 29, before the transfer of the home to the trust. The funds belonged to Marrama alone, and he has not presented any legitimate financial explanation for the action other than a desire to let Bolleterio control the money. Although Marrama argues that his payments to creditors with the funds from the refinancing demonstrate that he had no fraudulent intent, Marrama only claims to have used a small portion of the money to pay creditors, and he concealed the funds transferred to Bolleterio when listing his assets. In other words, he continued to have access to and control over the money, and any reasonable finder of fact would be compelled to conclude on the evidence presented that the transfer was motivated at least in part by a desire to keep the funds out of the hands of his creditors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, an array of undisputed facts support nearly every indication of fraudulent intent that we have recognized. Marrama transferred assets to the control of a person with whom he had a confidential relationship; Marrama admits that he retained beneficial interest in the assets; Marrama points to no evidence that he received valuable consideration for his transfer of the refinancing proceeds to Bolleterio; Marrama made the transfers while in financial distress and facing seizure of his assets; the transfers constitute a pattern of hiding assets that should have been subject to the bankruptcy proceeding; at least one of the transfers took place in violation of a state court order; and Marrama attempted to conceal at least his transfer of the refinancing proceeds to Bolleterio. <i>See In re Watman,</i> 301 F.3d at 8; <i>see also In re Marrama,</i> 430 F.3d at 482 (\"The instant case comports in all material respects with the classic profile of playing fast and loose with the bankruptcy process.\"); <i>In re Lang,</i> 246 B.R. at 470 (noting \"common fact pattern seen in &#167; 727(a)(2)(A) cases\" of a debtor who \"transfers property to a family member or close friend but retains the control or enjoyment of the transferred assets\"). To boot, Marrama admitted that he had transferred his vacation home to the trust in order to \"protect it,\" an inescapable reference to protection from his creditors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is only one reasonable inference that can be drawn from this record: that Marrama transferred valuable assets belonging to him, less than a year before he petitioned for bankruptcy protection, with the actual intent to defraud his creditors. <i>See In re Schifano,</i> 378 F.3d at 66-67. The bankruptcy court correctly granted summary judgment, and the district court correctly upheld that disposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We also narrated facts relating to this case in our previous opinion affirming the bankruptcy court's finding that Marrama's \"bad faith\" warranted the court's refusal to allow him to convert his petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection into a Chapter 13 case<i>See In re Marrama,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201956\"><a href=\"/opinion/201956/marrama-v-citizens-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">474</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 2005).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Marrama is represented by a different lawyer in this action</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The bank leveled other accusations as well.
