Appellants Arthur L. and\n\nRita M. Clark, the trustees of the several Clark family trusts,\n\nTheodore     Pérez,    and    Golden    Acres    Development      Corporation\n\n(collectively, \"Appellants\") brought suit against the former mayor\n\nof the City of Westfield and various former city council members\n\nand commissioners (collectively, \"Westfield\") for obstructing the\n\ndevelopment of a residential subdivision on their land. Appellants\n\nasserted     constitutional     substantive      due    process    and    equal\n\nprotection claims and sought monetary damages under 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1983.    The District Court for the District of Massachusetts, on\n\nrecommendation from the magistrate judge, dismissed Appellants'\n\nsuit under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for failing to state claims\n\nupon which relief could be granted.           Appellants now appeal.         For\n\nthe   reasons   set   forth   below,    we   affirm    the   district    court's\n\ndismissal.\n\n                               I. BACKGROUND\n\n           Arthur L. and Rita M. Clark acquired several parcels of\n\nland in Westfield, Massachusetts, which they sought to develop as\n\na residential subdivision.         In furtherance of this plan, they\n\ntransferred portions of their real estate holdings to various\n\nfamily trusts (collectively, \"the Clarks\") and hired an engineering\n\nfirm to prepare the necessary subdivision plans.\n\n           The Clarks' first subdivision plan was submitted to the\n\nCity of Westfield's Planning Board in 1997.             Following a hearing,\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fthe Planning Board rejected the plan because it included a fifty-\n\nfoot strip of land surrounding Chapin Pond that was allegedly owned\n\nby the city. The Clarks unsuccessfully revised and resubmitted the\n\nplan four times between 1997 and 2001.1          In 1998 the Clarks also\n\nfiled a petition in the Massachusetts Land Court to compel the city\n\nto try title to Chapin Pond.       Nine years later on March 2, 2007,\n\nthe Land Court found the City of Westfield to be the record title\n\nholder of Chapin Pond.2\n\n           In 2001, the Clarks entered into an agreement with their\n\nneighbor   and     Co-Appellant   Theodore      Pérez   to    combine   their\n\ncontiguous lands and develop them into residential subdivisions.\n\nTogether they created the Golden Acres Development Corporation and\n\nin December 2001 submitted plans for two proposed subdivisions to\n\nthe   Westfield    Planning   Board.3     The   Planning     Board   summarily\n\nrejected both these proposals in February 2002.\n\n           These same two plans were revised and resubmitted one\n\nmonth later.      Concurrently, the Clarks' attorney sent a letter to\n\nthe Westfield City Council requesting that the city's master plan\n\ntake into account the increased water and sewage capacity required\n\n\n1\n  The Planning Board rejected all of these submissions for various\nreasons, including inadequate access, danger to the local aquifer,\nand the city's claim of title over Chapin Pond.\n2\n  An adverse possession claim put forth by the Clarks as a part of\nthis same action is still pending.\n3\n   These were the Fairway Club Estates and Emerald Acres Estates\nsubdivision projects.\n\n                                    -4-\n\fby the Clarks' proposed subdivisions.          The request was unanimously\n\nrejected by the City Council and in April 2002, the Planning Board\n\nalso rejected at least one of Appellants' revised subdivision plans\n\nbecause it included property over which the city claimed ownership.\n\n            In June 2002, the Clarks' engineer met with the Westfield\n\nWater Commission to connect the proposed subdivisions to the\n\nmunicipal water supply.      At that meeting the engineer was advised\n\nthat the commissioners did not intend to grant Appellants municipal\n\nwater service because \"the City did not want the project there.\"\n\nDespite the finding by a Water Department contractor that the loop\n\ncreated by the proposed subdivisions would benefit the entire city\n\nwith increased water pressure and flow, the Water Commission voted\n\nto formally deny the Clarks' request on July 12, 2002.                        On\n\nSeptember    6,   2002,   Appellants    filed       suit   against   the   Water\n\nCommission in Massachusetts Superior Court. The suit was dismissed\n\nfor lack of jurisdiction.\n\n            Appellants assert that they were denied municipal water\n\nservice because they failed to first secure a connection to the\n\nmunicipal    sewer   line.      While   the    request     before    the   Water\n\nCommission    was    pending,   however,      the    Clarks'   engineer    also\n\npetitioned the Westfield Sewer Commission for service, and was\n\nturned down because Appellants had not yet been connected to the\n\nmunicipal water line.        The Sewer Commission was also concerned\n\nabout the sewer system's capacity and the Appellants' proposed\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fnumber of lots, and it indicated that any excess capacity that\n\nexisted in the sewer system would be allocated to other developers\n\nwho had previously requested service.\n\n          In   October   2002,   Appellants   submitted   their   final\n\nsubdivision plan to the Westfield Planning Board.          Due to the\n\ndenial of municipal water and sewage service, this plan proposed\n\nfewer lots and relied on the use of on-site water and waste\n\ndisposal systems.   This time the Planning Board solicited comments\n\nfrom all interested municipal boards and commissions, and the Water\n\nCommission responded by expressing its concern that the proposed\n\nsubdivision would threaten the municipal water supply and that its\n\nprimary access route crossed over a dam.          The city's health\n\ndirector also worried about the impact that the onsite septic\n\nsystems would have on the underlying aquifer, and recommended that\n\nthe city consider granting access to the municipal sewer and water\n\nlines.   After a public hearing, the Planning Board voted to deny\n\nthe modified plan on January 3, 2003.\n\n          On January 24, 2003, Appellants responded by filing a\n\ncomplaint against the Planning Board and the Water Commission in\n\nMassachusetts Land Court.   The Land Court eventually dismissed all\n\nclaims against the Water Commission for lack of jurisdiction.4       In\n\n\n\n\n4\n  As of the filing of this appeal the charges against the Planning\nBoard were ongoing.\n\n                                  -6-\n\fApril 2003, Appellants also filed a new request with the Westfield\n\nSewer Commission to gain access to the municipal sewer line.5\n\n          On October 7, 2003, the City of Westfield exercised its\n\neminent domain power to occupy thirty-eight acres of Pérez's\n\nproperty for the purpose of water supply protection.       Appellants\n\nallege   that   such   taking   rendered   their   development   plans\n\nunfeasible, as the proposed subdivision's access to the municipal\n\nroadway was planned through the Pérez land.\n\n          Appellants filed the instant suit in district court on\n\nJuly 8, 2005, asserting violations of the due process and equal\n\nprotection guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment, and requesting\n\ndamages under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.6 They alleged that Westfield\n\nconspired to interfere with the residential development of their\n\nlands. Westfield moved to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 12(b)(6) and the district court referred the matter to a\n\nmagistrate judge.\n\n          On August 14, 2006, the magistrate judge issued a report\n\nand recommendation that Appellants' claims be dismissed because\n\n\"land usage controversies between a plaintiff and state or local\n\nadministrative and political entities do not rise to the level of\n\ndue process violations, absent evidence of 'fundamental procedural\n\n\n5\n   At the time of filing of this appeal, the Commission had taken\nno action on the Appellants' request.\n6\n    Appellants also asserted state equal protection and civil\nconspiracy charges, which were dismissed and are not appealed.\n\n                                 -7-\n\firregularity, racial animus, or the like,'\" which Appellants did\n\nnot allege or produce.        Report and Recommendation With Regard to\n\nDefendants' Motion to Dismiss at 7, Clark v. Boscher, No. 05-30163-\n\nMAP (D. Mass. August 14, 2006)(quoting Matney v. City of N. Adams,\n\n359 F. Supp. 2d 20, 23 (D. Mass. 2005) (internal quotations\n\nomitted)). The magistrate judge also recommended dismissal for the\n\nequal   protection   claim.      Having   failed   to   raise   a   colorable\n\nconstitutional or federal statutory cause of action, Appellants\n\nwere not entitled to recovery under § 1983. The district court\n\nadopted the magistrate judge's report and recommendation in its\n\nentirety and dismissed Appellants' claims.\n\n                              II. DISCUSSION\n\n           A. Standard of Review\n\n           We review a district court's grant of a Rule 12(b)(6)\n\nmotion to dismiss de novo.      Garita Hotel Ltd. P'ship v. Ponce Fed.\n\nBank, F.S.B., 958 F.2d 15, 17 (1st Cir. 1992). In doing so, we\n\naccept as true all of Appellants' well-pleaded facts \"indulging all\n\nreasonable inferences therefrom.\" Ramos-Piñero v. Puerto Rico, 453\n\nF.3d 48, 51 (1st Cir. 2006).      Nonetheless, we reject \"'unsupported\n\nconclusions or interpretations of law.'\"           Stein v. Royal Bank of\n\nCanada, 239 F.3d 389, 392 (1st Cir. 2001) (quoting Wash. Legal\n\nFound. v. Mass. Bar Found., 993 F.2d 962, 971 (1st Cir. 1993)).            To\n\nsurvive Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, Appellants' well-pleaded facts\n\nmust \"possess enough heft to 'sho[w] that [Appellants are] entitled\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fto relief.'\"    Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, __ U.S. __, 127 S.\n\nCt. 1955, 1959 (2007).\n\n           B. Recovery under 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n\n           42 U.S.C. § 1983 does not endow plaintiffs with any\n\nsubstantive rights independent of those already granted under\n\nfederal law. Cruz-Erazo v. Rivera-Montañez, 212 F.3d 617, 621 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).    To recover under § 1983, a plaintiff must prove that\n\na deprivation of \"rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the\n\nConstitution and laws\" of the United States was carried out by\n\npersons acting under color of state law.         42 U.S.C. § 1983 (2000);\n\nRodríguez-Cirilo v. García, 115 F.3d 50, 52 (1st Cir. 1997).            Our\n\nfirst line of inquiry then is to determine whether Appellants'\n\nwell-pleaded facts demonstrate violations of their constitutional\n\ndue process and equal protection rights under the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment.\n\n                   1. Substantive Due Process\n\n           Appellants contend that their averred facts state a valid\n\nsubstantive due process claim entitling them to relief under § 1983\n\nbecause \"the actions of all City officials amount to an [sic]\n\npattern   of   arbitrary,   unreasonable   and    capricious   acts   which\n\ndeprive the Plaintiffs of their right to reasonably and legally use\n\ntheir property.\"    We disagree.\n\n           Substantive due process is a constitutional cause of\n\naction that leaves the door \"slightly ajar for federal relief in\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\ftruly horrendous situations.\"          Néstor Colón-Medina & Sucesores,\n\nInc. v. Custodio, 964 F.2d 32, 45 (1st Cir. 1992).                    In order to\n\nassert a valid substantive due process claim, Appellants have to\n\nprove that they suffered the deprivation of an established life,\n\nliberty, or property interest, and that such deprivation occurred\n\nthrough governmental action that shocks the conscience.                  Pagán v.\n\nCalderón, 448 F.3d 16, 32 (1st Cir. 2006); Rivera v. Rhode Island,\n\n402 F.3d 27, 33-34 (1st Cir. 2005).            In the instant case, whether\n\nAppellants have a recognized property interest in developing their\n\nland is ultimately immaterial because they have failed to prove\n\nthat Westfield engaged in behavior that shocks the conscience.\n\nSee, e.g., Mongeau v. City of Marlborough, 492 F.3d 14, 17 (1st\n\nCir. 2007) (stating that in order to assert a valid substantive due\n\nprocess claim, plaintiff who was involved in a land-use dispute was\n\nrequired to prove that the defendant city government's actions\n\nshocked the conscience).\n\n           We   have    repeatedly    held   that     \"'the     substantive    due\n\nprocess doctrine may not, in the ordinary course, be invoked to\n\nchallenge discretionary permitting or licensing determinations of\n\nstate or local decisionmakers, whether those decisions are right or\n\nwrong.'\"      Id. (quoting Pagán, 448 F.3d at 33); see also PFZ\n\nProperties,     Inc.   v.   Rodríguez,      928    F.2d   28,    31    (1st   Cir.\n\n1991)(\"[R]ejections of development projects and refusals to issue\n\nbuilding   permits     do   not   ordinarily      implicate     substantive    due\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fprocess.\"); Custodio, 964 F.2d at 45 (\"[T]he due process clause may\n\nnot ordinarily be used to involve federal courts in the rights and\n\nwrongs   of    local   planning     disputes.    In   the   vast     majority   of\n\ninstances, local and state agencies and courts are closer to the\n\nsituation and better equipped to provide relief.\").\n\n              Consequently, a run-of-the-mill land-use case such as\n\nthis one does not rise to the level of behavior that shocks the\n\nconscience.       Here, Appellants do not allege any \"fundamental\n\nprocedural irregularity, racial animus, or the like.\" See Creative\n\nEnvironments, Inc. v. Estabrook, 680 F.2d 822, 833 (1st Cir. 1982).\n\nNor do they contend that a fundamental principle has been violated.\n\nSee Amsden v. Moran, 904 F.2d 748, 754 (1st Cir. 1990).               Appellants\n\nmerely complain that they were denied the necessary permits to\n\ndevelop residential subdivisions on the Clark and Pérez land, and\n\nthat the City of Westfield denied such permits in furtherance of\n\nits own interests.\n\n              Indeed, the regulatory actions Appellants complain of are\n\nvirtually indistinguishable from others we have declined to find\n\nactionable in the past. See, e.g., Creative Environments, 680 F.2d\n\nat 826, 833-34 (holding that city planning board's denial of the\n\npermits required to develop a residential subdivision, allegedly\n\npremised   on    criteria    that   were     arbitrary   and   capricious       and\n\nexceeded   the    planning   board's    discretion,      did   not    constitute\n\nbehavior that shocked the conscience); SFW Arecibo, 415 F.3d at\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\f140-41 (holding that state planning board's revocation of building\n\npermits, allegedly without jurisdiction and thereby usurping the\n\njurisdiction of a state permitting agency, did not constitute\n\nconduct that shocked the conscience); Licari v. Ferruzzi, 22 F.3d\n\n344, 349-50 (1st Cir. 1994) (holding that city planning board's\n\nrevocation of building permits, delay in granting new permits, and\n\nunauthorized enforcement actions allegedly motivated by hostility\n\ntowards developer did not amount to conduct that shocked the\n\nconscience).    Given that Appellants' well-pleaded facts have not\n\nmet the Mongeau \"shocks the consciousness\" standard, Appellants\n\nhave   failed   to    establish    a   plausible    violation   of     their\n\nconstitutional right to substantive due process.\n\n                     2. Equal Protection7\n\n            Appellants contend that they \"were treated differently\n\nfrom others similarly situated\" with regard to Westfield's refusal\n\nto connect their proposed subdivisions to the municipal water and\n\nsewer lines. In support of this contention, Appellants identify\n\nthree development projects that, unlike Appellants', were granted\n\nmunicipal water and sewer service in April 2004 and May 2005.               A\n\nplausible   equal     protection   violation   is   established      when   a\n\nplaintiff shows by his or her well-pleaded facts that she was\n\n\n\n7\n   Though Appellants mistakenly label this a due process claim in\ntheir brief, the nature of their arguments and the allegations in\ntheir complaint make clear that they are advancing an equal\nprotection claim.\n\n                                   -12-\n\ftreated differently from \"others similarly situated . . . based on\n\nimpermissible considerations such as race, religion, intent to\n\ninhibit   or   punish   the   exercise    of   constitutional   rights,   or\n\nmalicious or bad faith intent to injure a person.\"          Aponte-Torres\n\nv. Univ. of P.R., 445 F.3d 50, 57 (1st Cir. 2006)                 (quoting\n\nBarrington Cove Ltd. P'ship v. R.I. Hous. and Mortgage Fin. Corp.,\n\n246 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2001)).          Even granting Appellants every\n\nreasonable inference, their well-pleaded facts fail to meet this\n\nstandard.8\n\n             Two persons or entities are similarly situated if \"a\n\nprudent person, looking objectively at the incidents [complained\n\nof], would think them roughly equivalent and the protagonists\n\nsimilarly situated . . . 'in all relevant respects.'\"           Barrington\n\nCove, 246 F.3d at 8 (quoting Dartmouth Review v. Dartmouth Coll.,\n\n889 F.2d 13, 19 (1st Cir. 1989)).          Applying the Barrington Cove\n\ntest, this Court must be able to compare apples to apples.         See id.\n\nAppellants in this case, however, have presented us with a fruit\n\nbasket. The three development projects identified by Appellants as\n\nhaving been granted access to Westfield's water and sewer lines\n\n\n\n8\n    In his report and recommendation, the magistrate judge\ninexplicably treated Appellants' equal protection charge as a 42\nU.S.C. § 1981(a) claim and recommended dismissal, \"as there is no\nargument that plaintiffs have been denied contract rights 'enjoyed\nby white citizens.'\" We find this analysis perplexing given that\nAppellants' assertion of disparate treatment is not related to\ntheir ability to enter or enforce contracts, nor is it related to\ntheir race.\n\n                                   -13-\n\fare: a private subdivision in the Munger Hill neighborhood, a 250-\n\nunit affordable housing community, and an industrial park.             All of\n\nthem were granted access in or after April 2004, almost two years\n\nafter the final time such access was denied to Appellants.                 By\n\ntheir   very    nature,   the   affordable   housing    community    and   the\n\nindustrial park differ significantly from Appellants' proposed\n\nsubdivisions, and it is therefore expected that different policy\n\ngrounds     influenced    Westfield's   decision      to   grant    municipal\n\nservices.      The Munger Hill subdivision, though of the same type as\n\nAppellants' proposed development, is located on a parcel of land\n\ndifferent      from    Appellants'.     As    such,    Westfield's   concern\n\nregarding the possible contamination of the aquifer underlying\n\nAppellants' tract does not come into play.

Consequently, the\n\nthree identified development projects are not similarly situated\n\nvis-à-vis Appellants' proposed subdivisions, and Appellants' well-\n\npleaded facts have failed to state a plausible violation of the\n\nequal protection clause.

Clark, the trustees of the several Clark family trusts, Theodore Peérez, and Golden Acres <span class=\"star-pagination\">*110</span> Development Corporation (collectively, \"Appellants\") brought suit against the former mayor of the City of Westfield and various former city council members and commissioners (collectively, \"Westfield\") for obstructing the development of a residential subdivision on their land. Appellants asserted constitutional substantive due process and equal protection claims and sought monetary damages under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The District Court for the District of Massachusetts, on recommendation from the magistrate judge, dismissed Appellants' suit under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) for failing to state claims upon which relief could be granted. Appellants now appeal. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the district court's dismissal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>BACKGROUND</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Arthur L. and Rita M. Clark acquired several parcels of land in Westfield, Massachusetts, which they sought to develop as a residential subdivision. In furtherance of this plan, they transferred portions of their real estate holdings to various family trusts (collectively, \"the Clarks\") and hired an engineering firm to prepare the necessary subdivision plans.</p>\n<p>The Clarks' first subdivision plan was submitted to the City of Westfield's Planning Board in 1997. Following a hearing, the Planning Board rejected the plan because it included a fifty-foot strip of land. surrounding Chapin Pond that was allegedly owned by the city. The Clarks unsuccessfully revised and resubmitted the plan four times between 1997 and 2001.<sup>[1]</sup> In 1998 the Clarks also filed a petition in the Massachusetts Land Court to compel the city to try title to Chapin Pond. Nine years later on March 2, 2007, the Land Court found the City of Westfield to be the record title holder of Chapin Pond.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>In 2001, the Clarks entered into an agreement with their neighbor and Co-Appellant Theodore Peérez to combine their contiguous lands and develop them into residential subdivisions. Together they created the Golden Acres Development Corporation and in December 2001 submitted plans for two proposed subdivisions to the Westfield Planning Board.<sup>[3]</sup> The Planning Board summarily rejected both these proposals in February 2002.</p>\n<p>These same two plans were revised and resubmitted one month later. Concurrently, the Clarks' attorney sent a letter to the Westfield City Council requesting that the city's master plan take into account the increased water and sewage capacity required by the Clarks' proposed subdivisions. The request was unanimously rejected by the City Council and in April 2002, the Planning Board also rejected at least one of Appellants' revised subdivision plans because it included property over which the city claimed ownership.</p>\n<p>In June 2002, the Clarks' engineer met with the Westfield Water Commission to connect the proposed subdivisions to the municipal water supply. At that meeting the engineer was advised that the commissioners did not intend to grant Appellants municipal water service because \"the City did not want the project there.\" Despite the finding by a Water Department contractor that the loop created by the proposed subdivisions would benefit the entire <span class=\"star-pagination\">*111</span> city with increased water pressure and flow, the Water Commission voted to formally deny the Clarks' request on July 12, 2002. On September 6, 2002, Appellants filed suit against the Water Commission in Massachusetts Superior Court. The suit was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>Appellants assert that they were denied municipal water service because they failed to first secure a connection to the municipal sewer line. While the request before the Water Commission was pending, however, the Clarks' engineer also petitioned the Westfield Sewer Commission for service, and was turned down because Appellants had not yet been connected to the municipal water line. The Sewer Commission was also concerned about the sewer system's capacity and the Appellants' proposed number of lots, and it indicated that any excess capacity that existed in the sewer system would be allocated to other developers who had previously requested service.</p>\n<p>In October 2002, Appellants submitted their final subdivision plan to the Westfield Planning Board. Due to the denial of municipal water and sewage service, this plan proposed fewer lots and relied on the use of on-site water and waste disposal systems. This time the Planning Board solicited comments from all interested municipal boards and commissions, and the Water Commission responded by expressing its concern that the proposed subdivision would threaten the municipal water supply and that its primary access route crossed Over a dam. The city's health director also worried about the impact that the onsite septic systems would have on the underlying aquifer, and recommended that the city consider granting access to the municipal sewer and water lines. After a public hearing, the Planning Board voted to deny the modified plan on January 3, 2003.</p>\n<p>On January 24, 2003, Appellants responded by filing a complaint against the Planning Board and the Water Commission in Massachusetts Land Court. The Land Court eventually dismissed all claims against the Water Commission for lack of jurisdiction.<sup>[4]</sup> In April 2003, Appellants also filed a new request with the Westfield Sewer Commission to gain access to the municipal sewer line.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>On October 7, 2003, the City of Westfield exercised its eminent domain power to occupy thirty-eight acres of Peérez's property for the purpose of water supply protection. Appellants allege that such taking rendered their development plans unfeasible, as the proposed subdivision's access to the municipal roadway was planned through the Peérez land.</p>\n<p>Appellants filed the instant suit in district court on July 8, 2005, asserting violations of the due process and equal protection guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment, and requesting damages under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.<sup>[6]</sup> They alleged that Westfield conspired to interfere with the residential development of their lands. Westfield moved to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and the district court referred the matter to a magistrate judge.</p>\n<p>On August 14, 2006, the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation that Appellants' claims be dismissed because <span class=\"star-pagination\">*112</span> \"land usage controversies between a plaintiff and state or local administrative and political entities do not rise to the level of due process violations, absent evidence of `fundamental procedural irregularity, racial animus, or the like,'\" which Appellants did not allege or produce. Report and Recommendation With Regard to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss at 7, <i>Clark v. Boscher,</i> No. 05-30163-MAP (D.Mass. August 14, 2006)(quoting <i>Matney v. City of N. Adams,</i> 359 F.Supp.2d 20, 23 (D.Mass. 2005) (internal quotations omitted)). The magistrate judge also recommended dismissal for the equal protection claim. Having failed to raise a colorable constitutional or federal statutory cause of action, Appellants were not entitled to recovery under § 1983. The district court adopted the magistrate judge's report and recommendation in its entirety and dismissed Appellants' claims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>DISCUSSION</i>\n</h2>\n<p>A. <i>Standard of Review</i></p>\n<p>We review a district court's grant of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss <i>de novo. </i><i>Garita Hotel Ltd. P'ship v. Ponce Fed. Bank, F.S.B.,</i> 958 F.2d 15, 17 (1st Cir.1992). In doing so, we accept as true all of Appellants' well-pleaded facts \"indulging all reasonable inferences therefrom.\" <i>Ramos-Pinero v. Puerto Rico,</i> 458 F.3d 48, 51 (1st Cir.2006). Nonetheless, we reject \"`unsupported conclusions or interpretations of law.'\" <i>Stein v. Royal Bank of Canada,</i> 239 F.3d 389, 392 (1st Cir.2001) (quoting <i>Wash. Legal Found. v. Mass. Bar Found.,</i> 993 F.2d 962, 971 (1st Cir.1993)). To survive Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, Appellants' well-pleaded facts must \"possess enough heft to `sho[w] that [Appellants are] entitled to relief.'\" <i>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1959, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007).</p>\n<p>B. <i>Recovery under 42 U.S.C. § 1983</i></p>\n<p>42 U.S.C. § 1983 does not endow plaintiffs with any substantive rights independent of those already granted under federal law. <i>Cruz-Erato v. Rivera-Monñtanez,</i> 212 F.3d 617, 621 (1st Cir.2000). To recover under § 1983, a plaintiff must prove that a deprivation of \"rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws\" of the United States was carried out by persons acting under color of state law. 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (2000); <i>Rodriguez-Cirilo v. Garcia,</i> 115 F.3d 50, 52 (1st Cir.1997). Our first line of inquiry then is to determine whether Appellants' well-pleaded facts demonstrate violations of their constitutional due process and equal protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p>1. <i>Substantive Due Process</i></p>\n<p>Appellants contend that their averred facts state a valid substantive due process claim entitling them to relief under § 1983 because \"the actions of all City officials amount to an [sic] pattern of arbitrary, unreasonable and capricious acts which deprive the Plaintiffs of their right to reasonably and legally use their property.\" We disagree.</p>\n<p>Substantive due process is a constitutional cause of action that leaves the door \"slightly a jar for federal relief in truly horrendous situations.\" <i>Neéstor Colon-Medina &amp; Sucesores, Inc. v. Custodio,</i> 964 F.2d 32, 45 (1st Cir.1992). In order to assert a valid substantive due process claim, Appellants have to prove that they suffered the deprivation of an established life, liberty, or property interest, and that such deprivation occurred through governmental action that shocks the conscience. <i>Pagán v. Calderón,</i> 448 F.3d 16, 32 (1st Cir.2006); <i>Rivera v. Rhode Island,</i> 402 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*113</span> F.3d 27, 33-34 (1st Cir.2005). In the instant case, whether Appellants have a recognized property interest in developing their land is ultimately immaterial because they have failed to prove that Westfield engaged in behavior that shocks the conscience. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Mongeau v. City of Marlborough,</i> 492 F.3d 14, 17 (1st Cir. 2007) (stating that in order to assert a valid substantive due process claim, plaintiff who was involved in a land-use dispute was required to prove that the defendant city government's actions shocked the conscience).</p>\n<p>We have repeatedly held that \"`the substantive due process doctrine may not, in the ordinary course, be invoked to challenge discretionary permitting or licensing determinations of state or local decision-makers, whether those decisions are right or wrong.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Pagan,</i> 448 F.3d at 33); <i>see also </i><i>PFZ Properties, Inc. v. Rodriguez,</i> 928 F.2d 28, 31 (1st Cir.1991)(\"[R]ejections of development projects and refusals to issue building permits do not ordinarily implicate substantive due process.\"); <i>Custodio,</i> 964 F.2d at 45 (\"[T]he due process clause may not ordinarily be used to involve federal courts in the rights and wrongs of local planning disputes. In the vast majority of instances, local and state agencies and courts are closer to the situation and better equipped to provide relief.\").</p>\n<p>Consequently, a run-of-the-mill land-use case such as this one does not rise to the level of behavior that shocks the conscience. Here, Appellants do not allege any \"fundamental procedural irregularity, racial animus, or the like.\" <i>See </i><i>Creative Environments, Inc. v. Estabrook,</i> 680 F.2d 822, 833 (1st Cir.1982). Nor do they contend that a fundamental principle has been violated. <i>See </i><i>Amsden v. Moran,</i> 904 F.2d 748, 754 (1st Cir.1990). Appellants merely complain that they were denied the necessary permits to develop residential subdivisions on the Clark and Peérez land, and that the City of Westfield denied such permits in furtherance of its own interests.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the regulatory actions Appellants complain of are virtually indistinguishable from others we have declined to find actionable in the past. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Creative Environments,</i> 680 F.2d at 826, 833-34 (holding that city planning board's denial of the permits required to develop a residential subdivision, allegedly premised on criteria that were arbitrary and capricious and exceeded the planning board's discretion, did not constitute behavior that shocked the \"conscience); <i>SFW Arecibo,</i> 415 F.3d at 140-41 (holding that state planning board's revocation of building permits, allegedly without jurisdiction and thereby usurping the jurisdiction of a state permitting agency, did not constitute conduct that shocked the conscience); <i>Licari v. Ferruzzi,</i> 22 F.3d 344, 349-50 (1st Cir. 1994) (holding that city planning board's revocation of building permits, delay in granting new permits, and unauthorized enforcement actions allegedly motivated by hostility towards developer did not amount to conduct that shocked the conscience). Given that Appellants' well-pleaded facts have not met the <i>Mongeau</i> \"shocks the consciousness\" standard, Appellants have failed to establish a plausible violation of their constitutional right to substantive due process.</p>\n<p>2. <i>Equal Protection</i><sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>Appellants contend that they \"were treated differently from others similarly situated\" with regard to Westfield's refusal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*114</span> to connect their proposed subdivisions to the municipal water and sewer lines. In support of this contention, Appellants identify three development projects that, unlike Appellants', were granted municipal water and sewer service in April 2004 and May 2005. A plausible equal protection violation is established when a plaintiff shows by his or her well-pleaded facts that she was treated differently from \"others similarly situated. . . . based on impermissible considerations such as race, religion, intent to inhibit or punish the exercise of constitutional rights, or malicious or bad faith intent to injure a person.\" <i>Aponte-Tirres v. Univ. of P.R.,</i> 445 F.3d 50, 57 (1st Cir.2006) (quoting <i>Barrington Cove Ltd. P'ship v. R.I. Hous. and Mortgage Fin, Corp.,</i> 246 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.2001)). Even granting Appellants every reasonable inference, their well-pleaded facts fail to meet this standard.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>Two persons or entities are similarly situated if \"a prudent person, looking objectively at the incidents [complained of], would think them roughly equivalent and the protagonists similarly situated . . . `in all relevant respects.'\" <i>Barrington Cove,</i> 246 F.3d at 8 (quoting <i>Dartmouth Review v. Dartmouth Coll.,</i> 889 F.2d 13, 19 (1st Cir.1989)). Applying the <i>Barrington Cove</i> test, this Court must be able to compare apples to apples. <i>See id.</i> Appellants in this case, however, have presented us with a fruit basket. The three development projects identified by Appellants as having been granted access to Westfield's water and sewer lines are: a private subdivision in the Munger Hill neighborhood, a 250-unit affordable housing community, and an industrial park. All of them were granted access in or after April 2004, almost two years after the final time such access was denied to Appellants. By their very nature, the affordable housing community and the industrial park differ significantly from Appellants' proposed subdivisions, and it is therefore expected that different policy grounds influenced Westfield's decision to grant municipal services. The Munger Hill subdivision, though of the same type as Appellants' proposed development, is located on a parcel of land different from Appellants'. As such, Westfield's concern regarding the possible contamination of the aquifer underlying Appellants' tract does not come into play. Neither does the still-pending property dispute regarding Chapin Pond. Consequently, the three identified development projects are not similarly situated vis-a-vis Appellants' proposed subdivisions, and Appellants' well-pleaded facts have failed to state a plausible violation of the equal protection clause. We need not reach the question of whether an equal protection claim would be established in this case if differential treatment had been shown. <i>See </i><i>Buchanan v. Maine,</i> 469 F.3d 158, 178 (\"[A] plaintiff not relying on `typical' impermissible categories, such as race or religion, must show that he was intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated, and that the different treatment was based on a malicious or bad faith intent to injure.\").</p>\n<p>As Appellants' well-pleaded facts have not established a plausible entitlement to relief under the Fourteenth Amendment, their § 1983 claim does not survive Rule <span class=\"star-pagination\">*115</span> 12(b)(6) review, and was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>CONCLUSION</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The Planning Board rejected all of these submissions for various reasons, including inadequate access, danger to the local aquifer, and the city's claim of title over Chapin Pond.</p>\n<p>[2]  An adverse possession claim put forth by the Clarks as a part of this same action is still pending.</p>\n<p>[3]  These were the Fairway Club Estates and Emerald Acres Estates subdivision projects.</p>\n<p>[4]  As of the filing of this appeal the charges against the Planning Board were ongoing.</p>\n<p>[5]  At the time of filing of this appeal, the Commission had taken no action on the Appellants' request.</p>\n<p>[6]  Appellants also asserted state equal protection and civil conspiracy charges, which were dismissed and are not appealed.</p>\n<p>[7]  Though Appellants mistakenly label this a due process claim in their brief, the nature of their arguments and the allegations in their complaint make clear that they are advancing an equal protection claim.</p>\n<p>[8]  In his report and recommendation, the magistrate judge inexplicably treated Appellants' equal protection, charge as a 42 U.S.C. § 1981(a) claim and recommended dismissal, \"as there is no argument that plaintiffs have been denied contract rights `enjoyed by white citizens.'\" We find this analysis perplexing given that Appellants' assertion of disparate treatment is not related to their ability to enter or enforce contracts, nor is it related to their race.</p>\n\n</div>",

Having failed to raise a colorable constitutional or federal statutory cause of action, Appellants were not entitled to recovery under § 1983. The district court adopted the magistrate judge's report and recommendation in its entirety and dismissed Appellants' claims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>DISCUSSION</i>\n</h2>\n<p>A. <i>Standard of Review</i></p>\n<p>We review a district court's grant of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss <i>de novo. </i><i>Garita Hotel Ltd.

Rivera-Monñtanez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768711\"><a href=\"/opinion/768711/no-99-1675/\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">617</span></a></span>, 621 (1st Cir.2000). To recover under § 1983, a plaintiff must prove that a deprivation of \"rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws\" of the United States was carried out by persons acting under color of state law. 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (2000); <i>Rodriguez-Cirilo v. Garcia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197391\"><a href=\"/opinion/197391/rodriguez-cirilo-v-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 52 (1st Cir.1997). Our first line of inquiry then is to determine whether Appellants' well-pleaded facts demonstrate violations of their constitutional due process and equal protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p>1. <i>Substantive Due Process</i></p>\n<p>Appellants contend that their averred facts state a valid substantive due process claim entitling them to relief under § 1983 because \"the actions of all City officials amount to an [sic] pattern of arbitrary, unreasonable and capricious acts which deprive the Plaintiffs of their right to reasonably and legally use their property.\" We disagree.</p>\n<p>Substantive due process is a constitutional cause of action that leaves the door \"slightly a jar for federal relief in truly horrendous situations.\" <i>Neéstor Colon-Medina &amp; Sucesores, Inc. v. Custodio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583574\"><a href=\"/opinion/583574/nestor-colon-medina-sucesores-inc-v-patria-g-custodio/\"><span class=\"volume\">964</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></a></span>, 45 (1st Cir.1992). In order to assert a valid substantive due process claim, Appellants have to prove that they suffered the deprivation of an established life, liberty, or property interest, and that such deprivation occurred through governmental action that shocks the conscience. <i>Pagán v. Calderón,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202216\"><a href=\"/opinion/202216/pagan-v-calderon/\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 32 (1st Cir.2006); <i>Rivera v. Rhode Island,</i> 402 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*113</span> F.3d 27, 33-34 (1st Cir.2005). In the instant case, whether Appellants have a recognized property interest in developing their land is ultimately immaterial because they have failed to prove that Westfield engaged in behavior that shocks the conscience. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Mongeau v. City of Marlborough,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202812\"><a href=\"/opinion/202812/mongeau-v-city-of-marlborough/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir. 2007) (stating that in order to assert a valid substantive due process claim, plaintiff who was involved in a land-use dispute was required to prove that the defendant city government's actions shocked the conscience).</p>\n<p>We have repeatedly held that \"`the substantive due process doctrine may not, in the ordinary course, be invoked to challenge discretionary permitting or licensing determinations of state or local decision-makers, whether those decisions are right or wrong.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Pagan,</i> 448 F.3d at 33); <i>see also </i><i>PFZ Properties, Inc. v. Rodriguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"557363\"><a href=\"/opinion/557363/pfz-properties-inc-v-rene-alberto-rodriguez-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">928</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span>, 31 (1st Cir.1991)(\"[R]ejections of development projects and refusals to issue building permits do not ordinarily implicate substantive due process.\"); <i>Custodio,</i> 964 F.2d at 45 (\"[T]he due process clause may not ordinarily be used to involve federal courts in the rights and wrongs of local planning disputes. In the vast majority of instances, local and state agencies and courts are closer to the situation and better equipped to provide relief.\").</p>\n<p>Consequently, a run-of-the-mill land-use case such as this one does not rise to the level of behavior that shocks the conscience. Here, Appellants do not allege any \"fundamental procedural irregularity, racial animus, or the like.\" <i>See </i><i>Creative Environments, Inc. v. Estabrook,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"405155\"><a href=\"/opinion/405155/creative-environments-inc-v-robert-estabrook/\"><span class=\"volume\">680</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">822</span></a></span>, 833 (1st Cir.1982). Nor do they contend that a fundamental principle has been violated. <i>See </i><i>Amsden v. Moran,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"542853\"><a href=\"/opinion/542853/henry-h-amsden-v-thomas-f-moran-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">904</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">748</span></a></span>, 754 (1st Cir.1990). Appellants merely complain that they were denied the necessary permits to develop residential subdivisions on the Clark and Peérez land, and that the City of Westfield denied such permits in furtherance of its own interests.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the regulatory actions Appellants complain of are virtually indistinguishable from others we have declined to find actionable in the past. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Creative Environments,</i> 680 F.2d at 826, 833-34 (holding that city planning board's denial of the permits required to develop a residential subdivision, allegedly premised on criteria that were arbitrary and capricious and exceeded the planning board's discretion, did not constitute behavior that shocked the \"conscience); <i>SFW Arecibo,</i> 415 F.3d at 140-41 (holding that state planning board's revocation of building permits, allegedly without jurisdiction and thereby usurping the jurisdiction of a state permitting agency, did not constitute conduct that shocked the conscience); <i>Licari v. Ferruzzi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195323\"><a href=\"/opinion/195323/licari-v-ferruzzi/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">344</span></a></span>, 349-50 (1st Cir. 1994) (holding that city planning board's revocation of building permits, delay in granting new permits, and unauthorized enforcement actions allegedly motivated by hostility towards developer did not amount to conduct that shocked the conscience). Given that Appellants' well-pleaded facts have not met the <i>Mongeau</i> \"shocks the consciousness\" standard, Appellants have failed to establish a plausible violation of their constitutional right to substantive due process.</p>\n<p>2. <i>Equal Protection</i><sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>Appellants contend that they \"were treated differently from others similarly situated\" with regard to Westfield's refusal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*114</span> to connect their proposed subdivisions to the municipal water and sewer lines. In support of this contention, Appellants identify three development projects that, unlike Appellants', were granted municipal water and sewer service in April 2004 and May 2005. A plausible equal protection violation is established when a plaintiff shows by his or her well-pleaded facts that she was treated differently from \"others similarly situated. . . . based on impermissible considerations such as race, religion, intent to inhibit or punish the exercise of constitutional rights, or malicious or bad faith intent to injure a person.\" <i>Aponte-Tirres v. Univ. of P.R.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></span>, 57 (1st Cir.2006) (quoting <i>Barrington Cove Ltd. P'ship v. R.I. Hous. and Mortgage Fin, Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199364\"><a href=\"/opinion/199364/barrington-cove-v-rhode-island-housing/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir.2001)). Even granting Appellants every reasonable inference, their well-pleaded facts fail to meet this standard.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>Two persons or entities are similarly situated if \"a prudent person, looking objectively at the incidents [complained of], would think them roughly equivalent and the protagonists similarly situated . . . `in all relevant respects.'\" <i>Barrington Cove,</i> 246 F.3d at 8 (quoting <i>Dartmouth Review v. Dartmouth Coll.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"531870\"><a href=\"/opinion/531870/the-dartmouth-review-on-behalf-of-its-officers-staff-and-subscribers-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 19 (1st Cir.1989)). Applying the <i>Barrington Cove</i> test, this Court must be able to compare apples to apples. <i>See id.</i> Appellants in this case, however, have presented us with a fruit basket. The three development projects identified by Appellants as having been granted access to Westfield's water and sewer lines are: a private subdivision in the Munger Hill neighborhood, a 250-unit affordable housing community, and an industrial park. All of them were granted access in or after April 2004, almost two years after the final time such access was denied to Appellants. By their very nature, the affordable housing community and the industrial park differ significantly from Appellants' proposed subdivisions, and it is therefore expected that different policy grounds influenced Westfield's decision to grant municipal services. The Munger Hill subdivision, though of the same type as Appellants' proposed development, is located on a parcel of land different from Appellants'. As such, Westfield's concern regarding the possible contamination of the aquifer underlying Appellants' tract does not come into play. Neither does the still-pending property dispute regarding Chapin Pond. Consequently, the three identified development projects are not similarly situated vis-a-vis Appellants' proposed subdivisions, and Appellants' well-pleaded facts have failed to state a plausible violation of the equal protection clause. We need not reach the question of whether an equal protection claim would be established in this case if differential treatment had been shown. <i>See </i><i>Buchanan v. Maine,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">158</span></span>, 178 (\"[A] plaintiff not relying on `typical' impermissible categories, such as race or religion, must show that he was intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated, and that the different treatment was based on a malicious or bad faith intent to injure.\").</p>\n<p>As Appellants' well-pleaded facts have not established a plausible entitlement to relief under the Fourteenth Amendment, their § 1983 claim does not survive Rule <span class=\"star-pagination\">*115</span> 12(b)(6) review, and was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>CONCLUSION</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The Planning Board rejected all of these submissions for various reasons, including inadequate access, danger to the local aquifer, and the city's claim of title over Chapin Pond.</p>\n<p>[2]  An adverse possession claim put forth by the Clarks as a part of this same action is still pending.</p>\n<p>[3]  These were the Fairway Club Estates and Emerald Acres Estates subdivision projects.</p>\n<p>[4]  As of the filing of this appeal the charges against the Planning Board were ongoing.</p>\n<p>[5]  At the time of filing of this appeal, the Commission had taken no action on the Appellants' request.</p>\n<p>[6]  Appellants also asserted state equal protection and civil conspiracy charges, which were dismissed and are not appealed.</p>\n<p>[7]  Though Appellants mistakenly label this a due process claim in their brief, the nature of their arguments and the allegations in their complaint make clear that they are advancing an equal protection claim.</p>\n<p>[8]  In his report and recommendation, the magistrate judge inexplicably treated Appellants' equal protection, charge as a 42 U.S.C. § 1981(a) claim and recommended dismissal, \"as there is no argument that plaintiffs have been denied contract rights `enjoyed by white citizens.'\" We find this analysis perplexing given that Appellants' assertion of disparate treatment is not related to their ability to enter or enforce contracts, nor is it related to their race.</p>\n\n</div>",
