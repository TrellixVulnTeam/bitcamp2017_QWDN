Accordingly,    \"appellate    review   is\n\ndeferential:     the district court's resolution of a dispute over a\n\ndefendant's role is reviewed only for clear error.\" Id. at 148-49.\n\nThat standard of review of factual determinations in the sentencing\n\ncontext remains unchanged after United States v.

This case is no\n\nexception.\n\n           \"A defendant who seeks a downward adjustment stemming\n\nfrom his supposedly peripheral role in the offense bears the burden\n\nof proof on that issue.            To qualify for a minor role reduction\n\n. . . , the defendant must satisfy a two-pronged test.                 First, he\n\nmust demonstrate that he is less culpable than most of those\n\ninvolved in the offenses of conviction.            Second, he must establish\n\nthat he is less culpable than most of those who have perpetrated\n\nsimilar crimes.\"       United States v. Mateo-Espejo, 426 F.3d 508, 512\n\n(1st Cir. 2005) (citations omitted), cert. denied, 126 S. Ct. 414\n\n(2006). Here, the district court did not clearly err in concluding\n\nthat Pérez had failed to satisfy that two-pronged burden.\n\n           In    declining    to    apply    a   minor-role     adjustment,    the\n\ndistrict court relied on undisputed evidence that, rather than\n\nsimply serve as a deckhand and intended offloader of the drugs once\n\nthey were onboard, Pérez had traveled 12 miles to get the drugs,\n\nhad   loaded    them   onto   a    speedboat     headed   for    a   known   drug-\n\ntrafficking location, was one of only two people onboard the\n\nspeedboat, and participated in throwing some of the drugs overboard\n\nonce the vessel was approached by law enforcement authorities. The\n\ncourt further noted that the amount of drugs--over 1,000 kilograms\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fof cocaine and over 6 kilograms of heroine--was \"huge\" as was the\n\namount   of    money   ($80,000)   that      Pérez   was   promised   for   his\n\nparticipation. In reaching the conclusion that these circumstances\n\nmade him more than a minor participant, the court properly rejected\n\nPérez's speculative argument that the other person onboard was more\n\nculpable simply because he was the captain of the ship.                In the\n\nabsence of any evidence of their respective roles, the fact that\n\none of the two individuals served as a captain \"does not indicate\n\nthat   [the]    other[]   on   board   had   a   less   significant   function\n\nrelative to the criminal activities.\"             United States, v. Coneo-\n\nGuerrero, 148 F.3d 44, 50-51 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n              Moreover, even if Pérez were the less culpable of the\n\ntwo, that would not automatically entitle him to a minor-role\n\nadjustment.      United States v. Murphy, 193 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).   To satisfy the second prong of the minor-role standard, a\n\ndefendant must be less culpable, not only than his co-participants,\n\nbut also than the ordinary average participant in the offense of\n\nconviction.      United States v. Sanchez, 354 F.3d 70, 75 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).    Where, as here, the offense of conviction is simply\n\npossession with intent to distribute drugs, not a broad-ranging\n\ndrug-trafficking conspiracy, \"it matters little . . . whether\n\ndefendant[] substantially participated in an alleged overall drug\n\nconspiracy.     The fact that [he] may or may not have been a smaller\n\npart of a larger conspiracy does not diminish [his] role in the\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fcocaine   possession   offense   charged   here.\"    United   States   v.\n\nRosario-Peralta, 199 F.3d 552, 571-72 (1st Cir. 1999); see also\n\nUnited States v. Wright, 873 F.2d 437, 442-43 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n           Thus, based on the totality of circumstances evidenced in\n\nthe record, we cannot say that the district court clearly erred in\n\nrejecting Pérez's bid for a minor-role reduction in his offense\n\nlevel.    Absent such an adjustment, the district court correctly\n\ncalculated Pérez's advisory guidelines sentencing range as 135 to\n\n168 months.    Nevertheless, applying the \"rule of leniency,\" the\n\ncourt sentenced him to only 110 months' imprisonment.2\n\n           Despite receiving a below-guidelines sentence, Pérez\n\nfaults the court for failing to explain the reasons for the\n\nsentence in terms of the statutory factors.         From the sentencing\n\ntranscript, it is obvious that the sentence was based primarily on\n\nthe guidelines calculations, which is not impermissible, since the\n\nguidelines \"continue . . . to be an important consideration in\n\nsentencing.\"   Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d at 518.      Both at the change\n\nof plea hearing and at sentencing, the court expressly recognized\n\nthat the guidelines are now advisory rather than mandatory, and,\n\nbefore imposing sentence, the court expressly stated that it had\n\n\n     2\n      That exercise of leniency was based on the court's\n(questionable) belief that because Pérez satisfied the requirements\nfor the \"safety valve,\" the applicable statute, 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3553(f), required that he be sentenced below the applicable\nstatutory minimum of 120-months. Understandably, Pérez does not\ncomplain about that exercise of leniency, and neither does the\ngovernment. Hence, we do not address it.\n\n                                  -5-\n\fconsidered not only the guidelines but also the sentencing factors\n\nset forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553.         Although the court did not discuss\n\nthose factors individually, such discussion is required only as to\n\nthose factors raised for the court's consideration at sentencing.\n\nUnited States v. Alli, 444 F.3d 34, 41 (1st Cir. 2006).                        At\n\nsentencing, defense counsel alluded briefly to some of Pérez's\n\npersonal circumstances, including his lack of a criminal record,\n\nhis status as an illegal alien, his parents' poverty, and his\n\nresulting need to work rather than complete his schooling, but he\n\nmade no arguments as to why those circumstances warranted a lighter\n\nsentence in light of any of the statutory factors.3\n\n           Moreover,       to    the   extent     that   the    district   court\n\nimplicitly      rejected   such    relatively     ordinary     circumstances   as\n\nwarranting a sentence even lower than the sentence imposed-- which\n\nwas already 15 months below the bottom of the guidelines range and\n\n10 months below the statutory minimum--we see nothing unreasonable\n\nabout    that    implicit       rationale    or   the    resulting    sentence.\n\nAccordingly, the judgment is affirmed.             See Loc. R. 27.0(c).\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      On appeal, Pérez argues, for the first time, that his status\nas a deportable alien warranted a lighter sentence because, as\nsuch, he is ineligible for any time-reduction programs while\nincarcerated.   This unpreserved claim falls far short of plain\nerror. See United States v. Beriguete Meran, 463 F.3d 47, 49 (1st\nCir. 2006) (per curiam) (finding rejection of similar argument to\nbe not unreasonable).\n\n                                       -6-\n\f",

From the sentencing\n\ntranscript, it is obvious that the sentence was based primarily on\n\nthe guidelines calculations, which is not impermissible, since the\n\nguidelines \"continue . . . to be an important consideration in\n\nsentencing.\"   Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d at 518.      Both at the change\n\nof plea hearing and at sentencing, the court expressly recognized\n\nthat the guidelines are now advisory rather than mandatory, and,\n\nbefore imposing sentence, the court expressly stated that it had\n\n\n     2\n      That exercise of leniency was based on the court's\n(questionable) belief that because Pérez satisfied the requirements\nfor the \"safety valve,\" the applicable statute, 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3553(f), required that he be sentenced below the applicable\nstatutory minimum of 120-months. Understandably, Pérez does not\ncomplain about that exercise of leniency, and neither does the\ngovernment. Hence, we do not address it.\n\n                                  -5-\n\fconsidered not only the guidelines but also the sentencing factors\n\nset forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553.         Although the court did not discuss\n\nthose factors individually, such discussion is required only as to\n\nthose factors raised for the court's consideration at sentencing.\n\nUnited States v. Alli, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202173\"><a href=\"/opinion/202173/united-states-v-alli/\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 41 (1st Cir. 2006).                        At\n\nsentencing, defense counsel alluded briefly to some of Pérez's\n\npersonal circumstances, including his lack of a criminal record,\n\nhis status as an illegal alien, his parents' poverty, and his\n\nresulting need to work rather than complete his schooling, but he\n\nmade no arguments as to why those circumstances warranted a lighter\n\nsentence in light of any of the statutory factors.3\n\n           Moreover,       to    the   extent     that   the    district   court\n\nimplicitly      rejected   such    relatively     ordinary     circumstances   as\n\nwarranting a sentence even lower than the sentence imposed-- which\n\nwas already 15 months below the bottom of the guidelines range and\n\n10 months below the statutory minimum--we see nothing unreasonable\n\nabout    that    implicit       rationale    or   the    resulting    sentence.\n\nAccordingly, the judgment is affirmed.             See Loc. R. 27.0(c).\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      On appeal, Pérez argues, for the first time, that his status\nas a deportable alien warranted a lighter sentence because, as\nsuch, he is ineligible for any time-reduction programs while\nincarcerated.   This unpreserved claim falls far short of plain\nerror. See United States v.
