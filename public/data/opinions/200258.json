The appellant, United Food and\n\nCommercial Workers International Union AFL-CIO-CLC, Local 1445\n\n(\"Union\")    appeals   from   the   district    court's      summary   judgment\n\nvacating an arbitration award that reinstated employee Leo Beaupre\n\nand reduced his discharge to a suspension without pay. Appellee is\n\nthe Poland Spring Corporation (\"Poland Spring\"), which terminated\n\nBeaupre for insubordinate behavior on February 5, 2000. We affirm.\n\n                              Background Facts\n\n            Poland Spring is a bottler of non-carbonated water with\n\nbottling facilities in Maine.           In 2000, Leo Beaupre worked for\n\nPoland Spring as a palletizer operator.          A palletizer is a machine\n\nthat loads cases of bottles onto pallets and wraps the full pallets\n\nin plastic for shipping.        As a palletizer operator, Beaupre was\n\nresponsible for placing empty pallets on the machine, removing\n\nloaded pallets, and keeping the area around his machine clean.\n\nSince his palletizer was elevated on legs above the floor, this\n\nhousekeeping task occasionally required him to remove stray bottles\n\nfrom under the machine.\n\n            The incident which led to Beaupre's termination occurred\n\non   the   night   shift   beginning    on   February   5,    2000.    Beaupre's\n\nsupervisor that night was Mike Arsenault, a former co-worker of\n\nBeaupre's who had recently been promoted to a supervisory role. At\n\nsome point during the shift, a group of employees got together and\n\nbegan playfully teasing Arsenault.           This group included Beaupre.\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fThe employees teased Arsenault rather crudely about his recent\n\npromotion, stating in starkly graphic terms how he was promoted for\n\nproviding an imaginative variety of sexual favors to the plant\n\nmanager, another male.\n\n             Arsenault did not appear offended at first.         In fact, at\n\nsome point Arsenault actually joined in the ribbing, pretending to\n\ncall up the plant manager on his radio to tell the manager that he\n\nwould be right up to see him.              Predictably, this spirit of\n\njocularity did not last.    According to Arsenault, the joking ended\n\nwhen the group received a radio call, and Arsenault assigned the\n\nemployees to various work tasks.         Beaupre, in contrast, testified\n\nthat Arsenault suddenly \"became unglued,\" stated \"[t]hat will be\n\nenough,\" and ordered everyone back to work.\n\n             When the banter ended, Arsenault directed Beaupre and\n\nanother worker to go into the filler room and help clean up stray\n\nbottles that were on the floor.          Beaupre explained to Arsenault\n\nthat due to an asthmatic condition, he could not work in the filler\n\nroom where elevated levels of ozone could be present.             Arsenault\n\nresponded that if Beaupre could not work in the filler room, he\n\nshould go clean bottles out from underneath the accumulation table.\n\nThe accumulation table is a large table where filled bottles coming\n\nfrom   the   filler   operation   can    accumulate   if   the   palletizer\n\noperation is interrupted.    The task would require Beaupre to crawl\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\funder the accumulation table, which stands on legs only a few feet\n\noff the floor.\n\n            Beaupre refused to follow this directive from Arsenault,\n\ntelling Arsenault that his \"crawling days [were] over; it's hard\n\nfor me to crawl into bed [and] hard for me to crawl out of bed.\"\n\nArsenault then repeated his directive to Beaupre, but Beaupre\n\ncontinued to refuse to clean out the bottles.                   According to\n\nArsenault, he then warned Beaupre that his non-compliance would\n\nconstitute    an    act   of   insubordination    which    could   result   in\n\nBeaupre's termination.         Nevertheless, Beaupre again refused to\n\ncomply with the order.\n\n             Arsenault then directed Beaupre to accompany him to a\n\nconference room.     On the way there Beaupre asked Arsenault whether\n\nhe was really going to fire Beaupre over a bottle of water, and\n\nalso asked Arsenault whether that would make him feel like a man.\n\nDespite the fact that Arsenault had now made it clear to Beaupre\n\nthat   he   could   face   termination     for   failure   to   comply   with\n\nArsenault's directives, he refused to clean up the bottles.\n\n             While they were walking toward the conference room,\n\nArsenault radioed a more experienced supervisor to join them. Also\n\njoining them were two other plant employees who came at Arsenault's\n\nrequest as witnesses.          Once again, the supervisors instructed\n\nBeaupre to go pick up the bottles as directed, and once again\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fBeaupre   refused   to    perform   the       assigned   work.   Beaupre    was\n\nsuspended pending investigation, and sent home.\n\n           The following day, the Union filed a grievance, alleging\n\nthat Arsenault's fraternizing and joking with the plant employees\n\nwas unprofessional, and that after being the subject of so much\n\nteasing, Arsenault retaliated by trying \"to embarrass [Beaupre] in\n\nfront of his peers by making him crawl under a conveyer for one\n\nbottle[.]\"\n\n           At a post-suspension \"Step 2\" hearing, Beaupre and the\n\nUnion offered two affirmative defenses explaining Beaupre's refusal\n\nto obey a directive. The Union's arguments were rejected, and\n\nfollowing the Step 2 grievance meeting, Poland Spring converted\n\nBeaupre's suspension to a termination of employment.\n\n                 The Collective Bargaining Agreement\n\n           The    Union   submitted       a    grievance    pursuant   to   the\n\ncollective bargaining agreement then in existence between it and\n\nPoland Spring. Article 32 of the agreement is entitled \"Discipline\n\nand Discharge\" and provides in plain language that insubordination\n\n\"shall\" constitute just cause for termination.              That Article also\n\nprovides that a number of offenses may warrant a lower level of\n\ndiscipline prior to discharge.        Insubordination, however, is not\n\nsuch an offense.    The relevant section of Article 32 provides:\n\n             Discipline and discharge shall only occur for\n             just cause. The parties agree that just cause\n             for discharge shall include, but not be\n             limited to, the following:\n\n                                    -5-\n\f            . . .\n            8. Insubordination\n            . . .\n\n            Under Article 33, the arbitrator's authority is expressly\n\nlimited to the provisions of the Agreement.         Accordingly \"[t]he\n\narbitrator shall have no power to alter or modify any of the terms\n\nof this Agreement or to impose on any party a limitation or\n\nobligation not explicitly provided for in this Agreement.\"\n\n                        The Arbitrator's Award\n\n            The factual findings of the arbitrator are substantially\n\nthose previously discussed.       Nevertheless, because the primary\n\nissue for our consideration is whether the arbitrator unambiguously\n\nfound that Beaupre's February 5 conduct was insubordinate, it is\n\nhelpful here to reproduce substantial portions of the arbitrator's\n\ndecision.\n\n            His discussion of the termination began:\n\n                   There is little doubt in this case that\n            absent some persuasive affirmative defense,\n            [Beaupre] was guilty of the offense of\n            insubordination on the February 5, 2000 night\n            shift.    Arsenault repeatedly ordered the\n            grievant to clean out the scrap bottle(s) from\n            under the accumulation table.     The grievant\n            repeatedly refused to comply with that\n            directive, even after first Arsenault and then\n            [another supervisor] made it clear to him that\n            he could be terminated for so refusing.\n\n            The   arbitrator   then   evaluated   the   two   affirmative\n\ndefenses raised by the Union.           First, the Union argued that\n\nBeaupre's repeated refusals to follow his supervisor's order were\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fmotivated    by       a   sincerely   held    concern       for   his   health.     The\n\narbitrator determined that this argument was not credible and that\n\nBeaupre's health was not the reason he refused to clean up the\n\nbottles.    The Union alternatively argued that because the order to\n\nclean up the bottles followed so closely upon the sexual banter\n\nbetween Arsenault and the plant workers, Beaupre believed he might\n\nhave been subjected to undue humiliation or embarrassment, or even\n\nrisk of sexual assault.               The arbitrator determined that this\n\ndefense    was    entirely      unpersuasive        and   that    any   apprehensions\n\nBeaupre might have had were not reasonable.\n\n            Since the arbitrator began his discussion by stating that\n\n\"absent some persuasive affirmative defense [Beaupre] was guilty of\n\nthe offense of insubordination,\" one might have expected the\n\narbitrator       to       conclude    his    analysis       after    rejecting     both\n\naffirmative       defenses      proffered     by    the     Union.      Instead,    the\n\narbitrator       stated      that    there    was    \"one    remaining     issue    for\n\ndiscussion, that being the level of discipline imposed.\"                           After\n\nthus declaring that he was now exploring remedial possibilities the\n\narbitrator broke down the term \"insubordination\" into two types:\n\nstraightforward           insubordination,        and     insubordination     in    the\n\npresence of mitigating circumstances.                   The arbitrator reasoned:\n\n                    [Article 32] may well establish that in\n             clear,     straight-forward       cases     of\n             insubordination,      without      mitigating\n             considerations, the parties by agreement have\n             established the per se rule that there is just\n             cause for termination. However, the language\n\n                                            -7-\n\f           of Article 32 does not state that even in the\n           presence    of    mitigating    circumstances,\n           insubordination still will necessarily provide\n           the company with just cause for termination.\n           On the contrary, where significant mitigating\n           considerations are present, the culpability of\n           the employee may be diminished, and summary\n           termination may no longer be justified. This\n           more complex fact situation must be considered\n           under the general, just cause standard set\n           forth in article 32, giving due weight to the\n           fact that the parties have agreed that a pure\n           case of insubordination, without mitigating\n           considerations, would provide just cause to\n           terminate.\n\n           Having distinguished straightforward insubordination from\n\ninsubordination        with   mitigating      circumstances,     the   arbitrator\n\nplaced Beaupre's claim in the latter category.                   The arbitrator\n\nfound that Beaupre's refusal to comply with his supervisor's\n\ndirective was mitigated by his supervisor's misconduct, which\n\n\"blurred   the    line    between      the    supervisor   and   the    workers.\"\n\nAccording to the arbitrator, once the supervisor joined in the\n\nribbing and sexual banter, his \"improper fraternizing with the\n\nworkers created an environment where one of the employees might\n\nthink, at least initially, that Arsenault was not acting in his\n\nsupervisory capacity, but rather only as one of the guys joking\n\naround on the shop floor.\"          The arbitrator concluded that \"it was\n\nunjust   for     the    Company   to    terminate    the   grievant      for   his\n\ninsubordinate behavior which immediately followed.\"               Nevertheless,\n\ndespite the presence of mitigating circumstances, the arbitrator\n\nconcluded that Beaupre's protracted refusal to comply with the\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fdirective     still   constituted   \"insubordinate   behavior.\"   The\n\narbitrator determined that:\n\n            [Beaupre] should have been able to figure out\n            that Arsenault had shifted gears and was now\n            acting in his supervisory capacity; he should\n            have promptly followed the directives of the\n            person   he  knew   to   be  his   supervisor.\n            Furthermore . . . Arsenault first alone and\n            then   with   the   assistance   of   [another\n            supervisor] gave the grievant clear warning of\n            the fact that his behavior had become\n            insubordinate, and gave the grievant numerous\n            opportunities over an extended period of time\n            to abandon his initial refusal, and to perform\n            the work as directed.\n\n             Ultimately the arbitrator concluded that while mitigating\n\ncircumstances rendered the company's decision to terminate Beaupre\n\nunjust, Beaupre's insubordinate behavior over an extended period of\n\ntime warranted a two week suspension without pay.\n\n                            Summary Judgment\n\n            Poland Spring filed suit in district court to vacate the\n\narbitration award.      The court granted summary judgment, finding\n\nthat the award exceeded the arbitrator's authority under the\n\nAgreement.    The court held that in the Agreement there is \"nothing\n\nabout 'clear, straight-forward' cases, 'pure' cases, or 'mitigating\n\ncircumstances.'\" The court found that under the circumstances, the\n\narbitrator lacked the authority under Article 32 to reinstate an\n\ninsubordinate employee.     The Union appealed.\n\n                               Discussion\n\n\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\f          Judicial review of an arbitrator's decision is extremely\n\nnarrow and deferential.   United Paperworks Intern. Union, AFL-CIO\n\nv. Misco, Inc., 484 U.S. 29, 36 (1987); Keebler Co. v. Truck\n\nDrivers, Local 170, 247 F.3d 8, 10 (1st Cir. 2001).    We do not sit\n\nas a court of appeal to hear claims of factual or legal error by an\n\narbitrator or to consider the merits of an award.   Misco, Inc., 484\n\nU.S. at 36-37.   We cannot vacate the award because the arbitrator\n\nmisreads the contract, where there is room to do so.   Id. at 37-38.\n\nNor are we authorized to reject his honest judgment as to the\n\nappropriate remedy, if the contract gives him the authority to\n\ndecide that question.   Id. at 38.   \"[A]s long as the arbitrator is\n\neven arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within\n\nthe scope of his authority, that a court is convinced he committed\n\nserious error does not suffice to overturn his decision.\"    Id.\n\n          Nevertheless, acknowledging that our role is a limited\n\none is not the equivalent of granting limitless power to the\n\narbitrator.   Georgia Pacific Co. v. Local 27, United Paperworkers\n\nInt'l Union, 864 F.2d 940, 944 (1st Cir. 1988).     The decision to\n\nsettle labor-management disputes through arbitration is a wholly\n\nvoluntary decision by private parties, grounded on their will as\n\nexpressed in the collective bargaining agreement. Id. \"Therefore,\n\nthe paramount point to be remembered in labor arbitration is that\n\nthe power and authority of an arbitrator is totally derived from\n\nthe collective bargaining agreement and that he violates his\n\n\n                               -10-\n\fobligation to the parties if he substitutes 'his own brand of\n\nindustrial justice' for what has been agreed to by the parties in\n\nthat contract.\"         Id. (quoting United Steelworkers v. Enterprise\n\nWheel & Car, 363 U.S. 593, 597 (1960); see also Misco Inc., 484\n\nU.S. at    38.     If     the   language      of   an   agreement    is    clear   and\n\nunequivocal, an arbitrator cannot give it a meaning other than that\n\nexpressed by the agreement.           Georgia-Pacific Co., 864 F.2d at 944.\n\n           In support of the arbitration award, the Union contends\n\nthat the arbitrator did not unambiguously find Beaupre guilty of\n\ninsubordination as that term is used in Article 32.                       Instead, it\n\nclaims, the arbitrator found that because Beaupre's actions were\n\nmitigated by the horseplay of his supervisor, Beaupre's conduct\n\nshould not be treated as insubordination per se, but should rather\n\nbe evaluated under the general, \"just cause\" standard also set\n\nforth in Article 32.            That is, since Beaupre's culpability was\n\nlessened   by    his    supervisor's       own     misconduct,      the    arbitrator\n\nproperly considered Beaupre's misconduct under the flexible \"just\n\ncause\" provision of Article 32, rather than the \"insubordination\"\n\nstandard of that same section.\n\n           We disagree with the Union's selective reading of the\n\narbitration      award.         The   award    unambiguously        concluded      that\n\nBeaupre's misconduct on the night of February 5, 2000 constituted\n\ninsubordination pursuant to Article 32 of the Agreement.                            The\n\narbitrator unequivocally found: first, that a clear order was\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\frepeatedly given to Beaupre; second, that Beaupre fully understood\n\nthe consequences of failure to comply with the order and yet\n\nrepeatedly refused to do so; and finally, the arbitrator concluded\n\nthat Beaupre's refusals to comply with the order constituted acts\n\nof insubordination subject to discipline under Article 32 of the\n\nagreement.\n\n           First, it is beyond dispute that the arbitrator found\n\nthat Beaupre repeatedly refused to comply with his supervisor's\n\ndirectives.     He concluded that \"the grievant declined to follow\n\nthis directive from Arsenault. Arsenault repeated his directive to\n\nthe grievant, but the grievant continued to refuse to clean out the\n\nbottles from under the accumulation table.\"\n\n             Second, the arbitrator found as a fact that Beaupre fully\n\nunderstood the consequences of his failure to comply with his\n\nsupervisor's directive.      After his second refusal of the order,\n\nBeaupre   accompanied    Arsenault   to   the   conference   room   for   a\n\ndisciplinary meeting.     On the way there, Beaupre asked Arsenault\n\nwhether \"he was the man that was going to take the grievant's job\n\nover a bottle of water, and if he did, would that make him feel\n\nlike a man.\"     Based on that statement, the arbitrator concluded\n\nthat \"[c]ertainly, then, the grievant at least by that point\n\nunderstood that he could face termination for failing to comply\n\nwith Arsenault's directive.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\f          Finally the arbitrator concluded that Beaupre's knowing\n\nrefusal to comply with the directive was \"insubordinate\" within the\n\nmeaning of the Agreement.    First, the arbitrator twice used the\n\nlanguage \"insubordinate behavior\" to describe Beaupre's conduct on\n\nthe night of February 5, 2000.     Second, the portion of the award\n\nconcerning Beaupre's culpability begins with the statement that\n\n\"[t]here is little doubt in this case that absent some persuasive\n\naffirmative defense, the grievant was guilty of the offense of\n\ninsubordination.\"   The award then proceeded to evaluate and reject\n\nthe affirmative defenses raised by Beaupre, leaving little doubt\n\nthat the arbitrator found Beaupre guilty of insubordination.\n\n          Upon reaching the conclusion that Beaupre's conduct was\n\ninsubordinate, the arbitrator was \"barred from further inquiry\n\nbecause such additional probing constituted 'ignor[ing] the plain\n\nlanguage of the contract.'\"      Georgia-Pacific Corp. v. Local 27\n\nUnited Paperworkers Int'l Union, 864 F.2d 940, 945 (1st Cir. 1988)\n\n(quoting Misco, Inc., 429 U.S. at 38).    This Court has long held\n\nthat once an arbitrator finds that an employee has committed an act\n\nspecifically listed in the collective bargaining agreement as\n\nproviding just cause for termination, the arbitrator is not free to\n\nfashion a separate remedy apart from the one provided by the\n\nparties' agreement. See Georgia-Pacific, 864 F.2d at 945; S.D.\n\nWarren Co. v. United Paperworkers' Int'l Union, 845 F.2d 3, 8 (1st\n\nCir. 1988); Metro Chevrolet, Inc. v. Unión de Tronquistas de Puerto\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fRico, 835 F.2d 3, 5 (1st Cir. 1987).        The rationale for this line\n\nof cases is simple: contractual provisions like the insubordination\n\nclause of Article 32 are bargained for and inserted precisely to\n\ntake discretion away from arbitrators charged with enforcing the\n\ncollective bargaining agreement.          Cf. Georgia-Pacific Corp, 864\n\nF.2d at 945 (\"'[A]n arbitrator does not have unfettered discretion.\n\nHe may not impose a remedy which directly contradicts the express\n\nlanguage   of   the   collective   bargaining   agreement.'\")   (quoting\n\nBruno's Inc. v. United Food & Com. Wkrs. Int'l Union, Local 1657,\n\n858 F.2d 1529, 1531 (11th Cir. 1988)). Consequently, the plain\n\nlanguage of Articles 32 and 33 left nothing to the arbitrator's\n\ndiscretion except to determine whether or not Beaupre's conduct was\n\ninsubordinate.\n\n           In Georgia-Pacific, this Court held that nearly identical\n\ncontract language gave the employer the right to discharge, leaving\n\nan arbitrator no discretion to fashion a remedy different from the\n\nparties' agreed-upon level of discipline.        864 F.2d at 942, 946.1\n\n\n1\n    In Georgia-Pacific, the agreement in issue provided that:\n\n           Any employee may be discharged for just cause.\n           Without limiting the generality of the\n           foregoing some of the causes for immediate\n           discharge are:\n           . . .\n           (5) dishonesty\n           . . . Georgia-Pacific, 864 F.2d at 942.\n\nThe arbitrator in Georgia-Pacific found that an employee had\nengaged in an act of dishonesty subjecting him to discipline.\nHowever, the arbitrator then overruled the company's decision to\n\n                                   -14-\n\fEvaluating the agreement in Georgia-Pacific, we determined: (1)\n\nthat   the   agreement    specifying     that     committing      an   offense    of\n\ndishonesty    subjected    an     employee   to    immediate      discharge      was\n\nunambiguous    on   its   face;    (2)   that     the   parties    inserted      the\n\nprovision \"precisely [to remove] optional choice on the part of the\n\narbitrator;\" and (3) that the arbitrator had no discretion to\n\nimpose another form of discipline once he found dishonesty. Id. at\n\n945-46.\n\n             By enumerating offenses that are subject to immediate\n\ndischarge and distinguishing those offenses from other forms of\n\nmisconduct that warrant a warning prior to discharge, the parties\n\nmanifested their intent to remove from the arbitrator's discretion\n\nthe power to fashion his own remedy for those offenses expressly\n\nsubjected to automatic discharge. See S.D. Warren Co., 845 F.2d at\n\n7-8 (finding that the purpose of an automatic discharge provision\n\nin a collective bargaining agreement reflects the parties' intent\n\nto \"remov[e] from the arbitrator the authority to determine a\n\nremedy once she concludes that a certain rule has been breached\").\n\nIf the parties intended mitigating circumstances to affect whether\n\n\n\nterminate the employee, based in part upon the employee's overall\nemployment record. This Court found that the arbitrator had no\ndiscretion to impose his own remedy once he found that the employee\nwas guilty of dishonesty.   Looking at the agreement, we concluded\nthat \"[i]t is difficult to imagine how one could use the English\nlanguage to state more clearly that dishonesty leads to immediate\ndischarge than is stated in [the agreement].\" Id. at 946 (citation\nand quotation omitted).\n\n                                     -15-\n\finsubordination constitutes just cause for termination, then they\n\nwould have expressed their intent in the contract. Because we find\n\nthat   the   arbitrator   determined    that   Beaupre   was   guilty   of\n\ninsubordination, his decision to fashion a separate remedy due to\n\nmitigating circumstances impermissibly substituted his own notions\n\nof industrial justice over those established by the contract. Id.;\n\naccord Misco, 484 U.S. at 38.2\n\n\n2\n   The Union asserts that instead of applying Georgia-Pacific, our\nanalysis ought to be guided by Keebler Co. v. Truck Drivers, Local\n170, 247 F.3d 8 (1st Cir. 2001) (holding that an arbitrator's\ndecision that conduct did not constitute gross insubordination drew\nits essence from the contract) and Crafts Precision Industries Inc.\nv. Lodge No. 1836, 889 F.2d 1184 (1st Cir. 1989) (upholding an\narbitrator's determination that some types of insubordination\nwarrant discharge while other less serious instances may warrant\nonly suspension).      We disagree. There are two key issues\ndistinguishing this case from the rule of law established in\nKeebler and Crafts Precision.\n\n   First, as we explained in Keebler, Keebler does not apply where,\nas is the case here, \"the arbitrator unambiguously found that the\ngrievant had committed conduct listed in his employment agreement\nas grounds for termination.\" Keebler, 247 F.3d at 14 n.2.\n\n   Second, the language of the collective bargaining agreements\ninvolved in both Keebler and Crafts Precision was substantially\nmore open and ambiguous than the contract language in Georgia-\nPacific, Warren and the instant case. As we explained in Crafts\nPrecision, the question of whether an arbitrator exceeded his\nauthority will often turn on whether the agreement delegated open-\nended discretion to the arbitrator, or instead, whether the\nagreement expressly provided that certain types misconduct shall\nconstitute just cause for discharge. Crafts Precision, 889 F.2 at\n1185; compare Keebler, 247 F.3d at 12-13 (noting that the agreement\nexpressly required arbitrator to distinguish between gross\ninsubordination, which would be subject to immediate discharge,\nfrom less serious instances of insubordination, which would not);\nand Craft Precision, 889 F.2d at 1185-86 (noting that the agreement\nvested the employer and arbitrator with the discretion to\ndistinguish conduct that \"may result in suspension\" from conduct\n\n                                 -16-\n\f           Lastly, the Union argues that because the collective\n\nbargaining agreement did not define the term insubordination, it\n\nwas   necessary   for   the   arbitrator     to   devise   a   definition   of\n\ninsubordination and determine whether the actions of Beaupre were\n\nthose which constitute insubordination warranting termination under\n\nthe Agreement.     According to this argument, when the arbitrator\n\ndistinguished     between     straightforward        insubordination        and\n\ninsubordination in the presence of mitigating circumstances, this\n\nwas precisely the type of interpretive analysis arbitrators are\n\nregularly called on to do.      Consequently, rather than fashioning a\n\nseparate remedy at odds with the one provided in the contract, the\n\narbitrator   merely      clarified     the    latently     ambiguous    term\n\ninsubordination and determined that the conduct involved here was\n\nsimply too minor to constitute insubordination as that term was\n\nintended by the parties.\n\n           Were it in fact true that the arbitrator was merely\n\ninterpreting the term insubordination, this argument might have\n\n\n\nthat warrants discharge) with Georgia-Pacific, 864 F.2d at 942\n(involving a contract which provided that any \"employee may be\ndischarged for just cause\" and then expressly listed dishonesty as\n\"one of the causes for immediate discharge\"). The language in the\ninstant agreement is nearly-identical to that of Georgia-Pacific in\nthat it enumerates misconduct which may warrant discharge without\nwarning. That is, it provides that \"just cause for discharge shall\ninclude . . . insubordination.\" (Emphasis added). Unlike Keebler\nand Crafts-Precision, the instant agreement lacks any language that\nwould authorize an arbitrator to distinguish between degrees of\ninsubordination, or permit an arbitrator to select from a variety\nof disciplinary remedies.\n\n                                     -17-\n\fsome   merit.      After       all,    the    Union    correctly       asserts    that\n\narbitrators have significant discretion to interpret the terms of\n\na collective bargaining agreement.             It is up to the arbitrator to\n\ndecide   whether      a        given    pattern       of     conduct     constitutes\n\ninsubordination.      Furthermore, the term insubordination is not\n\ndefined in the agreement and is obviously susceptible to multiple\n\ninterpretations.      Thus, the arbitrator here certainly would have\n\nbeen free to decide that Beaupre's conduct was simply too minor to\n\nrise to the level of insubordination as that term is used in the\n\ncontract.\n\n            Nevertheless, in this case it cannot be said that the\n\narbitrator's mitigating circumstances analysis was merely part of\n\nan   interpretation       of    the    term   insubordination.           First,    the\n\narbitrator never debated the meaning of the term insubordination,\n\nand concluded that Beaupre was guilty of \"insubordinate behavior\"\n\nthat \"extended over a lengthy period of time.\"                          Second, the\n\narbitrator did not begin his mitigating circumstances analysis\n\nuntil after he had established Beaupre's culpability and stated\n\nthat there was only            \"one remaining issue for discussion, that\n\nbeing the level of discipline imposed.\"                    Clearly, the mitigation\n\nsection of the award only arose when the arbitrator was considering\n\nhis remedial options, and not when he was supposedly engaged in an\n\ninterpretation of the term insubordination.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -18-\n\f          Beaupre's       situation      is   a   regrettable   one.        His\n\nsupervisor's misconduct undoubtedly temporarily blurred the line\n\nseparating supervisor and employee, and in so doing, created a\n\nscenario in which Beaupre, insulted and hurt by Arsenault's sudden\n\ntransformation from \"one of the guys\" to stern company supervisor,\n\nfelt justified in refusing the order.              Nevertheless, Beaupre's\n\ndefiance outlasted the confusion caused by Arsenault's horseplay.\n\nHe repeatedly refused a company directive even after that directive\n\nhad   become    a     formal   warning    delivered    repeatedly      by   two\n\nsupervisors.        The arbitrator deemed this conduct insubordinate,\n\nand, having done so, lacked the contractual authority to mitigate\n\nthe disciplinary action provided by the collective bargaining\n\nagreement.     Consequently, the arbitration award is unenforceable\n\nand the district court's judgment is affirmed.\n\n          Affirmed.       No costs are imposed.\n\n\n\n\n                           \"Concurrence follows\"\n\n\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\f            BOUDIN, Chief Judge (Concurring).    Leo Beaupre, then an\n\nemployee of Poland Spring Corp. at its facility in Maine, refused\n\nin February 2000 several direct instructions from two supervisors\n\nto pick up some bottles scattered under a table.        The company's\n\ncontract with Beaupre's union provides that \"[d]iscipline and\n\ndischarge shall occur only for just cause.      The parties agree that\n\njust cause for discharge shall include, but not be limited to, the\n\nfollowing: . . . Insubordination . . . .\"    After a warning, Beaupre\n\nwas discharged, and the union sought arbitration pursuant to the\n\ncontract.\n\n            In due course, the arbitrator found that Beaupre had\n\nclearly violated direct orders from his superiors even after he was\n\nadvised that this could be a firing offense, and the arbitrator\n\nfound unsupported several excuses offered for Beaupre's refusals\n\n(e.g., health concerns).   However, the arbitrator ruled that under\n\nthe contract \"mitigating considerations\" permitted the arbitrator\n\nto conclude that termination was too severe a penalty; finding\n\nmitigation here -- for example, tasteless jokes by Beaupre's direct\n\nsupervisor -- the arbitrator ruled that the penalty should be\n\nreduced to two weeks' suspension without pay.\n\n            Affirming the district court, the panel majority now\n\nholds that the arbitrator exceeded his authority in directing\n\nBeaupre's reinstatement.   It is common ground that the arbitrator\n\nis bound by provisions of the contract but also that the arbitrator\n\n\n                                -20-\n\fcan construe the contract.            See United Paperworkers Int'l Union v.\n\nMisco, Inc., 484 U.S. 29, 38 (1987).                 In effect, the arbitrator\n\ntakes over the court's role of initial construction; but there\n\nremains a vaguely defined limit:                a reviewing court may still\n\nconclude that the arbitrator is re-writing the terms instead of\n\nconstruing them.        See id.\n\n           Here, the arbitrator could permissibly have read the\n\ncontract   to    mean     that    some   acts   of    disobedience   constitute\n\n\"insubordination\" within the meaning of the contract and that\n\nother, less severe acts -- although literally disobedience -- do\n\nnot.   \"Insubordination\" is not defined in the contract nor is it\n\nself-defining and, reading the provision in context, a judge (and\n\neven more surely an arbitrator) would be likely to exclude trivial\n\ndisobedience,      such    as     a   refusal   to    light   the   supervisor's\n\ncigarette.      Consider that lack of cleanliness is also listed as a\n\nbasis for discharge under this contract, but certainly a smudge on\n\na nose would not qualify for discharge.              So, taking account of the\n\nseverity of the disobedience is, within broad limits, surely a part\n\nof the arbitrator's authority.\n\n           Viewed de novo, it is a more difficult question whether\n\nthe present contract can be read to limit management's right to\n\ndischarge an insubordinate employee where there exist \"mitigating\n\nconsiderations.\"        Of course, lack of the severity of disobedience\n\ncould be viewed as a mitigating consideration; but the arbitrator's\n\n\n                                         -21-\n\fclaim in this case is not focused on lack of severity.                Rather, he\n\nclaimed and exercised a broader mandate to take into account\n\nanything that might equitably bear on whether a discharge for\n\ndisobedience seemed fair and proportionate.\n\n             Most judges, interpreting this contract for themselves,\n\nwould probably reject this latter reading.             Taking the contract as\n\na   whole,    it    explicitly     reserves      disciplinary      authority   to\n\nmanagement, save as constrained by other provisions.                 Most judges\n\nwould likely take the \"just cause\" provision quoted above as\n\nlicensing management to discharge an employee who was patently\n\n\"insubordinate,\" even if he had served the company loyally for a\n\ndecade and had a sick wife at home and a child in college.                     The\n\ncontract     does   not   say   that    discharge     for   insubordination     is\n\npermitted only where \"just\" or \"fair.\"\n\n             Even so, the parties in this case empowered an arbitrator\n\nto interpret the contract and that includes the power to adopt\n\nreadings that a judge might reject if no arbitrator were involved.\n\nDoes this include a reading that allows the arbitrator to say that\n\ndisobedience is \"insubordination\" if there are adequate \"mitigating\n\nconsiderations\"      that   have       nothing   to    do   with    whether    the\n\ndisobedience was clear, deliberate, and pertinent to the employee's\n\nduties?    This is a stretch of language, to be sure, but whether it\n\n\n\n\n                                        -22-\n\fgoes too far to be a permissible arbitrator reading is something\n\nabout which reasonable judges might differ.3\n\n          This debatable issue has been resolved in this circuit.\n\nIn two different cases, this court has ruled that contracts,\n\nsimilarly structured as that at issue here, give management a right\n\nto discharge an employee guilty of a listed offense, and that an\n\narbitrator cannot mitigate the penalty because of ameliorative\n\ncircumstances.   See Georgia-Pacific Corp. v. Local 27, United\n\nPaperworkers Int'l Union, 864 F.2d 940 (1st Cir. 1988); S.D. Warren\n\nCo. v. United Paperworkers' Int'l Union, 845 F.2d 3 (1st Cir.),\n\ncert. denied, 488 U.S. 992 (1988).\n\n          In S.D. Warren, 845 F.2d at 6, the contract reserved to\n\nmanagement \"sole\" authority to discipline, subject to appended\n\nrules; and the appended rules said that \"[v]iolations\" of specified\n\nrules were \"causes for discharge,\" including \"[p]ossession\" of\n\nmarijuana on company property.          The discharged employees had\n\npossessed marijuana at the plant, but the arbitrator ruled that the\n\nsanction was too severe.   Id.    The Warren decision held that the\n\narbitrator had exceeded his power.      Id. at 8.\n\n\n\n\n3\n  For example, immediate consideration of \"fairness\" might push in\none direction; in the other, the long-term cost of unpredictability\nleading in turn to increased difficulty in negotiating even more\ndetailed provisions. Another factor, which might cut either way,\nmight be the practice in the industry. Yet another would be how\nfar the particular equities urged still had some connection with\nthe statutory language.\n\n                                 -23-\n\f            A similar conclusion was reached in Georgia-Pacific, 864\n\nF.2d at 942-43: the contract permitted discharge for \"dishonesty,\"\n\nand the employee had reported himself unable to work for medical\n\nreasons and had instead participated in a golf tournament.                       The\n\narbitrator ordered reinstatement based on the employee's many years\n\nof service.    Id. at 944.     Again, the court held that the arbitrator\n\nwas improperly rewriting the contract.              Id. at 946.        Thereafter,\n\nthis court several times acknowledged that S.D. Warren/Georgia-\n\nPacific were the rule even in cases where the court managed to\n\ndistinguish those cases on their facts. E.g., Keebler Co. v. Truck\n\nDrivers, Local 170, 247 F.3d 8, 13-14 & n.2 (1st Cir. 2001); Crafts\n\nPrecision     Indus.,   Inc.    v.   Lodge    No.    1836,     Int'l    Ass'n    of\n\nMachinists, 889 F.2d 1184, 1185-86 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n            Based on first principles and Supreme Court precedent,\n\nthe dissenting opinion in this case argues (in substance) that S.D.\n\nWarren and Georgia-Pacific were mistaken.              The first principles,\n\nthemselves derived from Supreme Court precedent, are inevitably\n\nquite   general   statements     about      the   scope   of    and     limits   to\n\narbitrator authority; some language helps Beaupre, some helps the\n\ncompany, and none of it in a debatable case like this one would be\n\ndecisive if we were deciding this case without any governing\n\ncircuit precedent.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -24-\n\f              As for the Supreme Court's holdings, only Misco has facts\n\narguably close to our own.4      In Misco, 484 U.S. at 41-42, the Court\n\nsaid   that    an   arbitrator   could    impose   a   lesser   remedy   than\n\ndischarge, arguably in a situation not too far from our own.              But\n\nthe Court's rationale is somewhat cryptic and turned in some\n\nmeasure on a peculiar stipulation of the parties that the issue in\n\ndispute was the existence of \"just cause,\" which was said to be\n\nopen to arbitral determination.          Id.   Read evenhandedly, Misco is\n\nof some help to Beaupre but also could itself be distinguished.\n\n              But this panel is not free to resolve this case based on\n\nfirst principles or a reading of Misco favorable to Beaupre.             S.D.\n\nWarren was decided after Misco -- indeed, on remand after an\n\nearlier S.D. Warren decision had been vacated by the Supreme Court\n\nfor reconsideration in light of Misco.         S.D. Warren, 845 F.3d at 4.\n\nThe decision in S.D. Warren is expressly a determination that\n\nneither Misco nor first principles preclude the decision by this\n\ncourt in S.D. Warren -- a decision that pretty clearly embraces our\n\nown facts.\n\n\n\n\n4\n  Other decisions include Eastern Associated Coal Corp. v. United\nMine Workers, 531 U.S. 57 (2000), and Major League Baseball Players\nAss'n v. Garvey, 532 U.S. 504 (2001). In Eastern, 531 U.S. at 60,\n67, the Court affirmed the arbitrator's award because           the\narbitrator did not find \"just cause\" for discharge, and the\nparties, by agreement, entrusted the remedial decision to the\narbitrator. In Garvey, 532 U.S. at 510, the Court held that an\narbitrator's award could not be set aside because of a court's\ndisagreement with the arbitrator's factual findings.\n\n                                   -25-\n\f          If our own case were before us as the first one to arise\n\nafter Misco, its proper disposition would present a difficult and\n\ninteresting issue. But the rule that binds successor panels, which\n\nserves to make law predictable, is decisive for me.   United States\n\nv.

I also agree that the\n\ndistrict court could reasonably have concluded that it was bound to\n\nreverse the arbitrator under Georgia-Pacific Corp. v. Local 27,\n\nUnited Paperworkers International Union, 864 F.2d 940 (1st Cir.\n\n1988), or S.D. Warren Co. v. United Paperworkers' International\n\nUnion, 845 F.2d 3 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 992 (1988).\n\nNonetheless, developments in the law of judicial review of arbitral\n\nawards make me doubt that Georgia-Pacific is good law now.\n\n            Under that evolving law, I think we are required to\n\naffirm the arbitrator's award.5             The majority relies on language\n\n\n5\n   Alternatively, remand to the arbitrator would be preferable to\nreversal.   \"[W]here the basis for an arbitrator's decision is\nunclear, but the arbitrator's opinion suggests that the decision\ndoes not draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement,\nremand is appropriate to have the arbitrator clarify the basis for\n\n                                        -27-\n\ffrom United Steelworkers of America v. Enterprise Wheel & Car\n\nCorp., 363 U.S. 593, 597 (1960), exempting awards that are merely\n\n\"[the arbitrator's] own brand of industrial justice\" from a general\n\npolicy of judicial deference. This qualification was reiterated in\n\nUnited Paperworkers International Union v. Misco, Inc., 484 U.S.\n\n29, 36 (1987).    In Misco, however, the Court went on to emphasize\n\nlanguage which the majority recites at the outset, but overlooks in\n\nits reasoning: \"But as long as the arbitrator is even arguably\n\nconstruing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of\n\nhis authority, that a court is convinced he committed serious error\n\ndoes not suffice to overturn his decision.\"     Id. at 38.      The Misco\n\nCourt then reversed the court of appeals decision to overturn an\n\narbitral award for misreading the evidence.     Id. at 45.\n\n           The Supreme Court has continued to mandate judicial\n\ndeference to arbitral awards in subsequent decisions.        In Eastern\n\nAssociated Coal Corp. v. United Mine Workers, 531 U.S. 57 (2000),\n\nthe Court again reversed a decision overturning an arbitral award.\n\nIn Eastern, the arbitrator had ordered reinstatement of an employee\n\nwho had been fired for failing a random drug test.

Id. at 60, 67.       The lower courts\n\nhad set aside the award on public policy grounds, a reason rejected\n\nby the Supreme Court.\n\n          Last    year,   the   Court   strongly       reaffirmed   the    high\n\nstandard required for judicial interference in arbitral decisions.\n\nIn Major League Baseball Players Ass'n v. Garvey, 532 U.S. 504\n\n(2001), the Court overturned the Ninth Circuit's reversal of an\n\narbitral award.      The Ninth Circuit had found reversal warranted\n\nbecause the arbitrator \"dispensed his own brand of industrial\n\njustice,\" id. at 507, in refusing to consider evidence supporting\n\nGarvey's claim.      The court of appeals labelled the arbitrator's\n\nfinding   \"completely     inexplicable\"     and    \"border[ing]      on    the\n\nirrational.\" Garvey v. Roberts, 203 F.3d 580, 590 (9th Cir. 2000).\n\nNonetheless,   the    Supreme   Court   responded       by   reiterating   its\n\nholdings in Misco and Eastern:\n\n          Courts are not authorized to review the\n          arbitrator's decision on the merits despite\n          allegations that the decision rests on factual\n          errors   or    misinterprets   the    parties'\n          agreement. We recently reiterated that if an\n          \"arbitrator is even arguably construing or\n          applying the contract and acting within the\n          scope of his authority,\" the fact that \"a\n          court is convinced he committed serious error\n          does not suffice to overturn his decision.\"\n\n532 U.S. at 509 (citations omitted).        Moreover, the Court went on\n\nto conclude that the error alleged -- ignoring important evidence\n\n-- did not even rise to the standard of serious error: \"The\n\n                                  -29-\n\farbitrator's analysis may have been unpersuasive to the Court of\n\nAppeals, but his decision hardly qualifies as serious error, let\n\nalone irrational or inexplicable error.            And, as we have said, any\n\nsuch error would not justify the actions taken by the court.\"                  Id.\n\nat 511 n.2.      In short, the court of appeals may not substitute its\n\nown   contractual     interpretation    for    the      arbitrator's,    without\n\nshowing more than \"serious error.\"          That is not the case here.\n\n             The majority finds that the arbitrator exceeded his\n\nauthority in interpreting the collective bargaining agreement and\n\nin his decision to reinstate Beaupre.          But the agreement gives him\n\nprecisely that authority.        The arbitrator's authority is set forth\n\nin Article 33, which governs grievance and arbitration.                        The\n\npresentation of a grievance is required to resolve \"differences ...\n\nas    to   the   meaning   or   application   of     the    provisions    of   the\n\nAgreement.\"       Any dispute after the third step of the grievance\n\nprocess is submitted to the arbitrator.            It is true that Article 33\n\ncontains a restriction:         \"The arbitrator shall have no power to\n\nalter or modify any of the terms of this Agreement or to impose on\n\nany party a limitation or obligation not explicitly provided for in\n\nthis Agreement.\"      Even with such a restriction, it is commonplace\n\nthat an arbitrator has authority to construe the terms of the\n\nagreement he is enforcing.         See, e.g., Steelworkers, 363 U.S. at\n\n599 (\"As we [have] emphasized, the question of interpretation of\n\nthe    collective    bargaining    agreement       is   a   question     for   the\n\n\n                                     -30-\n\farbitrator.         It   is     the   arbitrator's        construction        which   was\n\nbargained for; and so far as the arbitrator's decision concerns\n\nconstruction    of       the    contract,       the   courts    have     no    business\n\noverruling him because their interpretation of the contract is\n\ndifferent    from    his.\").          I   see   nothing    in   this    clause    which\n\nprohibits the arbitrator from construing the agreement, as he has\n\ndone here.\n\n            The majority also overestimates the restrictions placed\n\non arbitrators' ability to fashion a remedy.                    The majority holds\n\nthat \"once an arbitrator finds that an employee has committed an\n\nact specifically listed in the collective bargaining agreement as\n\nproviding just cause for termination, the arbitrator is not free to\n\nfashion a separate remedy apart from the one provided by the\n\nparties' agreement.\" Opinion at 12-13.                The majority takes this to\n\nmean that once the arbitrator found insubordination in this case,\n\nhe had no discretion as to remedy -- he was bound to uphold the\n\nemployee's termination.           But this view overlooks well-established\n\nlaw granting the arbitrator the same level of freedom in crafting\n\na remedy as he has in contractual interpretation.                      \"[W]here it is\n\ncontemplated   that       the    arbitrator      will     determine     remedies      for\n\ncontract violations that he finds, courts have no authority to\n\ndisagree with his honest judgment in that respect.\"                       Misco, 484\n\nU.S. at 38.    In Misco, it was the use or possession of controlled\n\nsubstances on company property which was listed as cause for\n\n\n                                          -31-\n\fdischarge.       The   arbitrator's     authority     was     limited    to\n\ninterpretation   and   application     of   terms    in     the   contract.\n\nNonetheless, the Court upheld the arbitrator's reinstatement of an\n\nemployee terminated for drug use on company property.             Id. at 35.\n\nThe remedy of reinstatement, under a contractual regime similar to\n\nthe one at issue here, was within the power of the arbitrator to\n\nfashion.\n\n           Admittedly, this result -- which I believe to be mandated\n\nby Supreme Court precedent -- poses some problems.                It is not\n\nentirely satisfactory to say to employers that they can draft the\n\ncollective bargaining agreement to clearly restrict the arbitrator\n\nfrom exercising the authority that the arbitrator applied here.\n\nThe realities of what happens at the bargaining table may make this\n\nillusory. Article 32 was admirably drafted to give management some\n\nflexibility and give workers the protection that not every instance\n\nof insubordination must mean termination. It can be questioned why\n\nthe price of that flexibility should be to permit an arbitrator to\n\nsecond guess management's judgment to be less forgiving of an\n\nemployee's disobedience of a direct order.          Here, the employer's\n\nunforgiving attitude is not irrational.      Beaupre was asked several\n\ntimes, including by a more mature and senior supervisor, to comply\n\nwith Arsenault's directive.   But that is not the question for the\n\ncourt.\n\n\n\n\n                                -32-\n\f          Instead,    under   the   law    that   the    Supreme   Court   has\n\ncrafted, we must defer to the arbitrator so long as he is \"even\n\narguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the\n\nscope of his authority.\"      Misco, 484 U.S. at 36.        I think we must\n\ndefer to the award.    The majority's decision is thoughtful, well-\n\nwritten, and sensitive.       The majority and I simply have a good\n\nfaith disagreement about the law.          To the extent Georgia-Pacific\n\nand S.D. Warren are taken to control the outcome of this case, I\n\nthink it time for this court to disavow both of those cases as\n\ninconsistent with Supreme Court precedent.              With regret, I find\n\nmyself in dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -33-\n\f",

Appellee is the Poland Spring Corporation (\"Poland Spring\"), which terminated Beaupre for insubordinate behavior on February 5, 2000. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Background Facts</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Poland Spring is a bottler of non-carbonated water with bottling facilities in Maine. In 2000, Leo Beaupre worked for Poland Spring as a palletizer operator. A palletizer is a machine that loads cases of bottles onto pallets and wraps the full pallets in plastic for shipping. As a palletizer operator, Beaupre was responsible for placing empty pallets on the machine, removing loaded pallets, and keeping the area around his machine clean. Since his palletizer was elevated on legs above the floor, this housekeeping task occasionally required him to remove stray bottles from under the machine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The incident which led to Beaupre's termination occurred on the night shift beginning on February 5, 2000. Beaupre's supervisor that night was Mike Arsenault, a former co-worker of Beaupre's who had recently been promoted to a supervisory role. At some point during the shift, a group of employees got together and began playfully teasing Arsenault. This group included Beaupre. The employees teased Arsenault rather crudely about his recent promotion, stating in starkly graphic terms how he was promoted for providing an imaginative variety of sexual favors to the plant manager, another male.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arsenault did not appear offended at first. In fact, at some point Arsenault actually joined in the ribbing, pretending to call up the plant manager on his radio to tell the manager that he would be right up to see him. Predictably, this spirit of jocularity did not last. According to Arsenault, the joking ended when the group received a radio call, and Arsenault assigned the employees to various work tasks. Beaupre, in contrast, testified that Arsenault suddenly \"became unglued,\" stated \"[t]hat will be enough,\" and ordered everyone back to work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the banter ended, Arsenault directed Beaupre and another worker to go into the filler room and help clean up stray bottles that were on the floor. Beaupre explained to Arsenault that due to an asthmatic condition, he could not work in the filler room where elevated levels of ozone could be present. Arsenault responded that if Beaupre could not work in the filler room, he should go clean bottles out from underneath the accumulation table. The accumulation table is a large table where filled bottles coming from the filler operation can accumulate if the palletizer operation is interrupted. The task would require Beaupre to crawl under the accumulation table, which stands on legs only a few feet off the floor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beaupre refused to follow this directive from Arsenault, telling Arsenault that his \"crawling days [were] over; it's hard for me to crawl into bed [and] hard for me to crawl out of bed.\" Arsenault then repeated his directive to Beaupre, but Beaupre continued to refuse to clean out the bottles. According to Arsenault, he then warned Beaupre that his non-compliance would constitute an act of insubordination which could result in Beaupre's termination. Nevertheless, Beaupre again refused to comply with the order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arsenault then directed Beaupre to accompany him to a conference room. On the way there Beaupre asked Arsenault whether he was really going to fire Beaupre over a bottle of water, and also asked Arsenault whether that would make him feel like a man. Despite the fact that Arsenault had now made it clear to Beaupre that he could face termination for failure to comply with Arsenault's directives, he refused to clean up the bottles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While they were walking toward the conference room, Arsenault radioed a more experienced supervisor to join them. Also joining them were two other plant employees who came at Arsenault's request as witnesses. Once again, the supervisors instructed Beaupre to go pick up the bottles as directed, and once again Beaupre refused to perform the assigned work. Beaupre was suspended pending investigation, and sent home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following day, the Union filed a grievance, alleging that Arsenault's fraternizing and joking with the plant employees was unprofessional, and that after being the subject of so much teasing, Arsenault retaliated by trying \"to embarrass [Beaupre] in front of his peers by making him crawl under a conveyer for one bottle[.]\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a post-suspension \"Step 2\" hearing, Beaupre and the Union offered two affirmative defenses explaining Beaupre's refusal to obey a directive. The Union's arguments were rejected, and following the Step 2 grievance meeting, Poland Spring converted Beaupre's suspension to a termination of employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>The Collective Bargaining Agreement</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Union submitted a grievance pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement then in existence between it and Poland Spring. Article 32 of the agreement is entitled \"Discipline and Discharge\" and provides in plain language that insubordination \"shall\" constitute just cause for termination. That Article also provides that a number of offenses may warrant a lower level of discipline prior to discharge. Insubordination, however, is not such an offense. The relevant section of Article 32 provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Discipline and discharge shall only occur for just cause. The parties agree that just cause for discharge shall include, but not be limited to, the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">8. Insubordination</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Article 33, the arbitrator's authority is expressly limited to the provisions of the Agreement. Accordingly \"[t]he arbitrator shall have no power to alter or modify any of the terms of this Agreement or to impose on any party a limitation or obligation not explicitly provided for in this Agreement.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>The Arbitrator's Award</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The factual findings of the arbitrator are substantially those previously discussed. Nevertheless, because the primary issue for our consideration is whether the arbitrator unambiguously found that Beaupre's February 5 conduct was insubordinate, it is helpful here to reproduce substantial portions of the arbitrator's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">His discussion of the termination began:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is little doubt in this case that absent some persuasive affirmative defense, [Beaupre] was guilty of the offense of insubordination on the February 5, 2000 night shift. Arsenault repeatedly ordered the grievant to clean out the scrap bottle(s) from under the accumulation table. The grievant repeatedly refused to comply with that directive, even after first Arsenault and then [another supervisor] made it clear to him that he could be terminated for so refusing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The arbitrator then evaluated the two affirmative defenses raised by the Union. First, the Union argued that Beaupre's repeated refusals to follow his supervisor's order were motivated by a sincerely held concern for his health. The arbitrator determined that this argument was not credible and that Beaupre's health was not the reason he refused to clean up the bottles. The Union alternatively argued that because the order to clean up the bottles followed so closely upon the sexual banter between Arsenault and the plant workers, Beaupre believed he might have been subjected to undue humiliation or embarrassment, or even risk of sexual assault. The arbitrator determined that this defense was entirely unpersuasive and that any apprehensions Beaupre might have had were not reasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the arbitrator began his discussion by stating that \"absent some persuasive affirmative defense [Beaupre] was guilty of the offense of insubordination,\" one might have expected the arbitrator to conclude his analysis after rejecting both affirmative defenses proffered by the Union. Instead, the arbitrator stated that there was \"one remaining issue for discussion, that being the level of discipline imposed.\" After thus declaring that he was now exploring remedial possibilities the arbitrator broke down the term \"insubordination\" into two types: straightforward insubordination, and insubordination in the presence of mitigating circumstances. The arbitrator reasoned:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Article 32] may well establish that in clear, straight-forward cases of insubordination, without mitigating considerations, the parties by agreement have established the per se rule that there is just cause for termination. However, the language of Article 32 does not state that even in the presence of mitigating circumstances, insubordination still will necessarily provide the company with just cause for termination. On the contrary, where significant mitigating considerations are present, the culpability of the employee may be diminished, and summary termination may no longer be justified. This more complex fact situation must be considered under the general, just cause standard set forth in article 32, giving due weight to the fact that the parties have agreed that a pure case of insubordination, without mitigating considerations, would provide just cause to terminate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having distinguished straightforward insubordination from insubordination with mitigating circumstances, the arbitrator placed Beaupre's claim in the latter category. The arbitrator found that Beaupre's refusal to comply with his supervisor's directive was mitigated by his supervisor's misconduct, which \"blurred the line between the supervisor and the workers.\" According to the arbitrator, once the supervisor joined in the ribbing and sexual banter, his \"improper fraternizing with the workers created an environment where one of the employees might think, at least initially, that Arsenault was not acting in his supervisory capacity, but rather only as one of the guys joking around on the shop floor.\" The arbitrator concluded that \"it was unjust for the Company to terminate the grievant for his insubordinate behavior which immediately followed.\" Nevertheless, despite the presence of mitigating circumstances, the arbitrator concluded that Beaupre's protracted refusal to comply with the directive still constituted \"insubordinate behavior.\" The arbitrator determined that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Beaupre] should have been able to figure out that Arsenault had shifted gears and was now acting in his supervisory capacity; he should have promptly followed the directives of the person he knew to be his supervisor. Furthermore...

The decision to settle labor-management disputes through arbitration is a wholly voluntary decision by private parties, grounded on their will as expressed in the collective bargaining agreement. <i>Id.</i> \"Therefore, the paramount point to be remembered in labor arbitration is that the power and authority of an arbitrator is totally derived from the collective bargaining agreement and that he violates his obligation to the parties if he substitutes `his own brand of industrial justice' for what has been agreed to by the parties in that contract.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>United Steelworkers v.

Instead, it claims, the arbitrator found that because Beaupre's actions were mitigated by the horseplay of his supervisor, Beaupre's conduct should not be treated as insubordination per se, but should rather be evaluated under the general, \"just cause\" standard also set forth in Article 32. That is, since Beaupre's culpability was lessened by his supervisor's own misconduct, the arbitrator properly considered Beaupre's misconduct under the flexible \"just cause\" provision of Article 32, rather than the \"insubordination\" standard of that same section.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree with the Union's selective reading of the arbitration award. The award unambiguously concluded that Beaupre's misconduct on the night of February 5, 2000 constituted insubordination pursuant to Article 32 of the Agreement. The arbitrator unequivocally found: first, that a clear order was repeatedly given to Beaupre; second, that Beaupre fully understood the consequences of failure to comply with the order and yet repeatedly refused to do so; and finally, the arbitrator concluded that Beaupre's refusals to comply with the order constituted acts of insubordination subject to discipline under Article 32 of the agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, it is beyond dispute that the arbitrator found that Beaupre repeatedly refused to comply with his supervisor's directives. He concluded that \"the grievant declined to follow this directive from Arsenault. Arsenault repeated his directive to the grievant, but the grievant continued to refuse to clean out the bottles from under the accumulation table.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the arbitrator found as a fact that Beaupre fully understood the consequences of his failure to comply with his supervisor's directive. After his second refusal of the order, Beaupre accompanied Arsenault to the conference room for a disciplinary meeting. On the way there, Beaupre asked Arsenault whether \"he was the man that was going to take the grievant's job over a bottle of water, and if he did, would that make him feel like a man.\" Based on that statement, the arbitrator concluded that \"[c]ertainly, then, the grievant at least by that point understood that he could face termination for failing to comply with Arsenault's directive.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally the arbitrator concluded that Beaupre's knowing refusal to comply with the directive was \"insubordinate\" within the meaning of the Agreement. First, the arbitrator twice used the language \"insubordinate behavior\" to describe Beaupre's conduct on the night of February 5, 2000. Second, the portion of the award concerning Beaupre's culpability begins with the statement that \"[t]here is little doubt in this case that absent some persuasive affirmative defense, the grievant was guilty of the offense of insubordination.\" The award then proceeded to evaluate and reject the affirmative defenses raised by Beaupre, leaving little doubt that the arbitrator found Beaupre guilty of insubordination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon reaching the conclusion that Beaupre's conduct was insubordinate, the arbitrator was \"barred from further inquiry because such additional probing constituted `ignor[ing] the plain language of the contract.'\" <i>Georgia-Pacific Corp. v. Local 27 United Paperworkers Int'l Union,</i> 864 F.2d 940, 945 (1st Cir.1988) (quoting <i>Misco, Inc.,</i> 484 U.S. at 38, 108 S.Ct. 364). This Court has long held that once an arbitrator finds that an employee has committed an act specifically listed in the collective bargaining agreement as providing just cause for termination, the arbitrator is not free to fashion a separate remedy apart from the one provided by the parties' agreement. <i>See Georgia-Pacific,</i> 864 F.2d at 945; <i>S.D. Warren Co. v. United Paperworkers' Int'l Union,</i> 845 F.2d 3, 8 (1st Cir.1988); <i>Metro Chevrolet, Inc. v. Union de Tronquistas de Puerto Rico,</i> 835 F.2d 3, 5 (1st Cir.1987). The rationale for this line of cases is simple: contractual provisions like the insubordination clause of Article 32 are bargained for and inserted precisely to take discretion away from arbitrators charged with enforcing the collective bargaining agreement. <i>Cf. Georgia-Pacific Corp.,</i> 864 F.2d at 945 (\"`[A]n arbitrator does not have unfettered discretion. He may not impose a remedy which directly contradicts the express language of the collective bargaining agreement.'\") (quoting <i>Bruno's, Inc. v. United Food &amp; Com. Wkrs. Int'l Union, Local 1657,</i> 858 F.2d 1529, 1531 (11th Cir.1988)). Consequently, the plain language of Articles 32 and 33 left nothing to the arbitrator's discretion except to determine whether or not Beaupre's conduct was insubordinate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Georgia-Pacific,</i> this Court held that nearly identical contract language gave the employer the right to discharge, leaving an arbitrator no discretion to fashion a remedy different from the parties' agreed-upon level of discipline. 864 F.2d at 942, 946.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Evaluating the agreement in <i>Georgia-Pacific,</i> we determined: (1) that the agreement specifying that committing an offense of dishonesty subjected an employee to immediate discharge was unambiguous on its face; (2) that the parties inserted the provision \"precisely [to remove] optional choice on the part of the arbitrator;\" and (3) that the arbitrator had no discretion to impose another form of discipline once he found dishonesty. <i>Id.</i> at 945-46.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By enumerating offenses that are subject to immediate discharge and distinguishing those offenses from other forms of misconduct that warrant a warning prior to discharge, the parties manifested their intent to remove from the arbitrator's discretion the power to fashion his own remedy for those offenses expressly subjected to automatic discharge. <i>See S.D. Warren Co.,</i> 845 F.2d at 7-8 (finding that the purpose of an automatic discharge provision in a collective bargaining agreement reflects the parties' intent to \"remov[e] from the arbitrator the authority to determine a remedy once she concludes that a certain rule has been breached\"). If the parties intended mitigating circumstances to affect whether insubordination constitutes just cause for termination, then they would have expressed their intent in the contract. Because we find that the arbitrator determined that Beaupre was guilty of insubordination, his decision to fashion a separate remedy due to mitigating circumstances impermissibly substituted his own notions of industrial justice over those established by the contract. <i>Id.; accord Misco,</i> 484 U.S. at 38, 108 S.Ct. 364.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, the Union argues that because the collective bargaining agreement did not define the term insubordination, it was necessary for the arbitrator to devise a definition of insubordination and determine whether the actions of Beaupre were those which constitute insubordination warranting termination under the Agreement. According to this argument, when the arbitrator distinguished between straightforward insubordination and insubordination in the presence of mitigating circumstances, this was precisely the type of interpretive analysis arbitrators are regularly called on to do. Consequently, rather than fashioning a separate remedy at odds with the one provided in the contract, the arbitrator merely clarified the latently ambiguous term insubordination and determined that the conduct involved here was simply too minor to constitute insubordination as that term was intended by the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Were it in fact true that the arbitrator was merely interpreting the term insubordination, this argument might have some merit. After all, the Union correctly asserts that arbitrators have significant discretion to interpret the terms of a collective bargaining agreement. It is up to the arbitrator to decide whether a given pattern of conduct constitutes insubordination. Furthermore, the term insubordination is not defined in the agreement and is obviously susceptible to multiple interpretations. Thus, the arbitrator here certainly would have been free to decide that Beaupre's conduct was simply too minor to rise to the level of insubordination as that term is used in the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, in this case it cannot be said that the arbitrator's mitigating circumstances analysis was merely part of an interpretation of the term insubordination. First, the arbitrator never debated the meaning of the term insubordination, and concluded that Beaupre was guilty of \"insubordinate behavior\" that \"extended over a lengthy period of time.\" Second, the arbitrator did not begin his mitigating circumstances analysis until after he had established Beaupre's culpability and stated that there was only \"one remaining issue for discussion, that being the level of discipline imposed.\" Clearly, the mitigation section of the award only arose when the arbitrator was considering his remedial options, and not when he was supposedly engaged in an interpretation of the term insubordination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beaupre's situation is a regrettable one. His supervisor's misconduct undoubtedly temporarily blurred the line separating supervisor and employee, and in so doing, created a scenario in which Beaupre, insulted and hurt by Arsenault's sudden transformation from \"one of the guys\" to stern company supervisor, felt justified in refusing the order. Nevertheless, Beaupre's defiance outlasted the confusion caused by Arsenault's horseplay. He repeatedly refused a company directive even after that directive had become a formal warning delivered repeatedly by two supervisors. The arbitrator deemed this conduct insubordinate, and, having done so, lacked the contractual authority to mitigate the disciplinary action provided by the collective bargaining agreement. Consequently, the arbitration award is unenforceable and the district court's judgment is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Affirmed.</i> No costs are imposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In<i>Georgia-Pacific,</i> the agreement in issue provided that:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Any employee may be discharged for just cause.

However, the arbitrator then overruled the company's decision to terminate the employee, based in part upon the employee's overall employment record. This Court found that the arbitrator had no discretion to impose his own remedy once he found that the employee was guilty of dishonesty. Looking at the agreement, we concluded that \"[i]t is difficult to imagine how one could use the English language to state more clearly that dishonesty leads to immediate discharge than is stated in [the agreement].\" <i>Id.</i> at 946 (citation and quotation omitted).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The Union asserts that instead of applying<i>Georgia-Pacific,</i> our analysis ought to be guided by <i>Keebler Co. v. Truck Drivers, Local 170,</i> 247 F.3d 8 (1st Cir.2001) (holding that an arbitrator's decision that conduct did not constitute gross insubordination drew its essence from the contract) and <i>Crafts Precision Industries Inc. v. Lodge No. 1836,</i> 889 F.2d 1184 (1st Cir.1989) (upholding an arbitrator's determination that some types of insubordination warrant discharge while other less serious instances may warrant only suspension). We disagree. There are two key issues distinguishing this case from the rule of law established in <i>Keebler</i> and <i>Crafts Precision.</i></p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">First, as we explained in <i>Keebler, Keebler</i> does not apply where, as is the case here, \"the arbitrator unambiguously found that the grievant had committed conduct listed in his employment agreement as grounds for termination.\" <i>Keebler,</i> 247 F.3d at 14 n. 2.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Second, the language of the collective bargaining agreements involved in both <i>Keebler</i> and <i>Crafts Precision</i> was substantially more open and ambiguous than the contract language in Georgia-Pacific, <i>Warren</i> and the instant case. As we explained in <i>Crafts Precision,</i> the question of whether an arbitrator exceeded his authority will often turn on whether the agreement delegated open-ended discretion to the arbitrator, or instead, whether the agreement expressly provided that certain types misconduct shall constitute just cause for discharge. <i>Crafts Precision,</i> 889 F.2d at 1185; <i>compare Keebler,</i> 247 F.3d at 12-13 (noting that the agreement expressly required arbitrator to distinguish between <i>gross</i> insubordination, which would be subject to immediate discharge, from less serious instances of insubordination, which would not); <i>and Crafts Precision,</i> 889 F.2d at 1185-86 (noting that the agreement vested the employer and arbitrator with the discretion to distinguish conduct that \"<i>may</i> result in suspension\" from conduct that warrants discharge) <i>with Georgia-Pacific,</i> 864 F.2d at 942 (involving a contract which provided that any \"employee may be discharged for just cause\" and then expressly listed dishonesty as \"one of the causes for immediate discharge\"). The language in the instant agreement is nearly-identical to that of <i>Georgia-Pacific</i> in that it enumerates misconduct which may warrant discharge without warning. That is, it provides that \"just cause for discharge <i>shall include</i>... insubordination.\" (Emphasis added). Unlike <i>Keebler</i> and <i>Crafts-Precision,</i> the instant agreement lacks any language that would authorize an arbitrator to distinguish between degrees of insubordination, or permit an arbitrator to select from a variety of disciplinary remedies.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BOUDIN, Chief Judge (Concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leo Beaupre, then an employee of Poland Spring Corp. at its facility in Maine, refused in February 2000 several direct instructions from two supervisors to pick up some bottles scattered under a table. The company's contract with Beaupre's union provides that \"[d]iscipline and discharge shall occur only for just cause. The parties agree that just cause for discharge shall include, but not be limited to, the following: ... Insubordination....\" After a warning, Beaupre was discharged, and the union sought arbitration pursuant to the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, the arbitrator found that Beaupre had clearly violated direct orders from his superiors even after he was advised that this could be a firing offense, and the arbitrator found unsupported several excuses offered for Beaupre's refusals (<i>e.g.,</i> health concerns). However, the arbitrator ruled that under the contract \"mitigating considerations\" permitted the arbitrator to conclude that termination was too severe a penalty; finding mitigation here &#8212; for example, tasteless jokes by Beaupre's direct supervisor &#8212; the arbitrator ruled that the penalty should be reduced to two weeks' suspension without pay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirming the district court, the panel majority now holds that the arbitrator exceeded his authority in directing Beaupre's reinstatement. It is common ground that the arbitrator is bound by provisions of the contract but also that the arbitrator can construe the contract. <i>See United Paperworkers Int'l Union v. Misco, Inc.,</i> 484 U.S. 29, 38, 108 S.Ct. 364, 98 L.Ed.2d 286 (1987). In effect, the arbitrator takes over the court's role of initial construction; but there remains a vaguely defined limit: a reviewing court may still conclude that the arbitrator is re-writing the terms instead of construing them. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the arbitrator could permissibly have read the contract to mean that some acts of disobedience constitute \"insubordination\" within the meaning of the contract and that other, less severe acts &#8212; although literally disobedience &#8212; do not. \"Insubordination\" is not defined in the contract nor is it self-defining and, reading the provision in context, a judge (and even more surely an arbitrator) would be likely to exclude trivial disobedience, such as a refusal to light the supervisor's cigarette. Consider that lack of cleanliness is also listed as a basis for discharge under this contract, but certainly a smudge on a nose would not qualify for discharge. So, taking account of the severity of the disobedience is, within broad limits, surely a part of the arbitrator's authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed <i>de novo,</i> it is a more difficult question whether the present contract can be read to limit management's right to discharge an insubordinate employee where there exist \"mitigating considerations.\" Of course, lack of the severity of disobedience could be viewed as a mitigating consideration; but the arbitrator's claim in this case is not focused on lack of severity. Rather, he claimed and exercised a broader mandate to take into account anything that might equitably bear on whether a discharge for disobedience seemed fair and proportionate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most judges, interpreting this contract for themselves, would probably reject this latter reading. Taking the contract as a whole, it explicitly reserves disciplinary authority to management, save as constrained by other provisions. Most judges would likely take the \"just cause\" provision quoted above as licensing management to discharge an employee who was patently \"insubordinate,\" even if he had served the company loyally for a decade and had a sick wife at home and a child in college. The contract does not say that discharge for insubordination is permitted only where \"just\" or \"fair.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even so, the parties in this case empowered an <i>arbitrator</i> to interpret the contract and that includes the power to adopt readings that a judge might reject if no arbitrator were involved. Does this include a reading that allows the arbitrator to say that disobedience is \"insubordination\" if there are adequate \"mitigating considerations\" that have nothing to do with whether the disobedience was clear, deliberate, and pertinent to the employee's duties? This is a stretch of language, to be sure, but whether it goes too far to be a permissible <i>arbitrator</i> reading is something about which reasonable judges might differ.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This debatable issue has been resolved in this circuit. In two different cases, this court has ruled that contracts, similarly structured as that at issue here, give management a right to discharge an employee guilty of a listed offense, and that an arbitrator cannot mitigate the penalty because of ameliorative circumstances. <i>See Georgia-Pacific Corp. v. Local 27, United Paperworkers Int'l Union,</i> 864 F.2d 940 (1st Cir.1988); <i>S.D. Warren Co. v. United Paperworkers' Int'l Union,</i> 845 F.2d 3 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 488 U.S. 992, 109 S.Ct. 555, 102 L.Ed.2d 582 (1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>S.D. Warren,</i> 845 F.2d at 6, the contract reserved to management \"sole\" authority to discipline, subject to appended rules; and the appended rules said that \"[v]iolations\" of specified rules were \"causes for discharge,\" including \"[p]ossession\" of marijuana on company property. The discharged employees had possessed marijuana at the plant, but the arbitrator ruled that the sanction was too severe. <i>Id.</i> The <i>Warren</i> decision held that the arbitrator had exceeded his power. <i>Id.</i> at 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A similar conclusion was reached in <i>Georgia-Pacific,</i> 864 F.2d at 942-43: the contract permitted discharge for \"dishonesty,\" and the employee had reported himself unable to work for medical reasons and had instead participated in a golf tournament. The arbitrator ordered reinstatement based on the employee's many years of service. <i>Id.</i> at 944. Again, the court held that the arbitrator was improperly rewriting the contract. <i>Id.</i> at 946. Thereafter, this court several times acknowledged that <i>S.D. Warren/Georgia-Pacific</i> were the rule even in cases where the court managed to distinguish those cases on their facts. <i>E.g., Keebler Co. v. Truck Drivers, Local 170,</i> 247 F.3d 8, 13-14 &amp; n. 2 (1st Cir.2001); <i>Crafts Precision Indus., Inc. v.

Warren</i> and <i>Georgia-Pacific</i> were mistaken. The first principles, themselves derived from Supreme Court precedent, are inevitably quite general statements about the scope of and limits to arbitrator authority; some language helps Beaupre, some helps the company, and none of it in a debatable case like this one would be decisive if we were deciding this case without any governing circuit precedent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the Supreme Court's <i>holdings,</i> only <i>Misco</i> has facts arguably close to our own.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> In <i>Misco,</i> 484 U.S. at 41-42, 108 S.Ct. 364, the Court said that an arbitrator could impose a lesser remedy than discharge, arguably in a situation not too far from our own. But the Court's rationale is somewhat cryptic and turned in some measure on a peculiar stipulation of the parties that the issue in dispute was the existence of \"just cause,\" which was said to be open to arbitral determination. <i>Id.</i> Read evenhandedly, <i>Misco</i> is of some help to Beaupre but also could itself be distinguished.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But this panel is not free to resolve this case based on first principles or a reading of <i>Misco</i> favorable to Beaupre. <i>S.D.

Warren,</i> 845 F.2d at 4. The decision in <i>S.D. Warren</i> is expressly a determination that neither <i>Misco</i> nor first principles preclude the decision by this court in <i>S.D.

But the rule that binds successor panels, which serves to make law predictable, is decisive for me. <i>United States v. Wogan,</i> 938 F.2d 1446, 1449 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 502 U.S. 969, 112 S.Ct. 441, 116 L.Ed.2d 460 (1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> For example, immediate consideration of \"fairness\" might push in one direction; in the other, the long-term cost of unpredictability leading in turn to increased difficulty in negotiating even more detailed provisions.

In <i>Eastern,</i> 531 U.S. at 60, 67, 121 S.Ct. 462, the Court affirmed the arbitrator's award because the arbitrator did not find \"just cause\" for discharge, and the parties, by agreement, entrusted the remedial decision to the arbitrator. In <i>Garvey,</i> 532 U.S. at 510, 121 S.Ct. 1724, the Court held that an arbitrator's award could not be set aside because of a court's disagreement with the arbitrator's factual findings.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LYNCH, Circuit Judge (Dissenting).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The arbitrator interpreted Article 32 of the collective bargaining agreement to say the type of insubordination meant to be encompassed within the \"just cause\" for termination was insubordination without any mitigating circumstances. The majority says that this interpretation exceeded the arbitrator's scope of authority. I disagree, and so, with respect, I dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I do agree that this case can be distinguished from <i>Keebler Co. v.

Lodge No. 1836, International Ass'n of Machinists,</i> 889 F.2d 1184 (1st Cir.1989), on the grounds given by the majority. I also agree that the district court could reasonably have concluded that it was bound to reverse the arbitrator under <i>Georgia-Pacific Corp. v. Local 27, United Paperworkers International Union,</i> 864 F.2d 940 (1st Cir.1988), or <i>S.D. Warren Co. v. United Paperworkers' International Union,</i> 845 F.2d 3 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 488 U.S. 992, 109 S.Ct. 555, 102 L.Ed.2d 582 (1988). Nonetheless, developments in the law of judicial review of arbitral awards make me doubt that <i>Georgia-Pacific</i> is good law now.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under that evolving law, I think we are required to affirm the arbitrator's award.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The majority relies on language from <i>United Steelworkers of America v. Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp.,</i> 363 U.S. 593, 597, 80 S.Ct. 1358, 4 L.Ed.2d 1424 (1960), exempting awards that are merely \"[the arbitrator's] own brand of industrial justice\" from a general policy of judicial deference. This qualification was reiterated in <i>United Paperworkers International Union v. Misco, Inc.,</i> 484 U.S. 29, 36, 108 S.Ct. 364, 98 L.Ed.2d 286 (1987). In <i>Misco,</i> however, the Court went on to emphasize language which the majority recites at the outset, but overlooks in its reasoning: \"But as long as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority, that a court is convinced he committed serious error does not suffice to overturn his decision.\" <i>Id.</i> at 38, 108 S.Ct. 364. The <i>Misco</i> Court then reversed the court of appeals decision to overturn an arbitral award for misreading the evidence. <i>Id.</i> at 45, 108 S.Ct. 364.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has continued to mandate judicial deference to arbitral awards in subsequent decisions. In <i>Eastern Associated Coal Corp. v. United Mine Workers,</i> 531 U.S. 57, 121 S.Ct. 462, 148 L.Ed.2d 354 (2000), the Court again reversed a decision overturning an arbitral award. In <i>Eastern,</i> the arbitrator had ordered reinstatement of an employee who had been fired for failing a random drug test. The arbitrator reasoned that mitigating circumstances &#8212; including a long employment history and stress caused by family problems &#8212; outweighed the admitted drug use. <i>Id.</i> at 60, 67, 121 S.Ct. 462. The lower courts had set aside the award on public policy grounds, a reason rejected by the Supreme Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Last year, the Court strongly reaffirmed the high standard required for judicial interference in arbitral decisions. In <i>Major League Baseball Players Ass'n v. Garvey,</i> 532 U.S. 504, 121 S.Ct. 1724, 149 L.Ed.2d 740 (2001), the Court overturned the Ninth Circuit's reversal of an arbitral award. The Ninth Circuit had found reversal warranted because the arbitrator \"dispensed his own brand of industrial justice,\" <i>id.</i> at 507, 121 S.Ct. 1724, in refusing to consider evidence supporting Garvey's claim. The court of appeals labelled the arbitrator's finding \"completely inexplicable\" and \"border[ing] on the irrational.\" <i>Garvey v. Roberts,</i> 203 F.3d 580, 590 (9th Cir.2000). Nonetheless, the Supreme Court responded by reiterating its holdings in <i>Misco</i> and <i>Eastern:</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts are not authorized to review the arbitrator's decision on the merits despite allegations that the decision rests on factual errors or misinterprets the parties' agreement. We recently reiterated that if an \"arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority,\" the fact that \"a court is convinced he committed serious error does not suffice to overturn his decision.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">532 U.S. at 509, 121 S.Ct. 1724 (citations omitted). Moreover, the Court went on to conclude that the error alleged &#8212; ignoring important evidence &#8212; did not even rise to the standard of serious error: \"The arbitrator's analysis may have been unpersuasive to the Court of Appeals, but his decision hardly qualifies as serious error, let alone irrational or inexplicable error. And, as we have said, any such error would not justify the actions taken by the court.\" <i>Id.</i> at 511 n. 2, 121 S.Ct. 1724. In short, the court of appeals may not substitute its own contractual interpretation for the arbitrator's, without showing more than \"serious error.\" That is not the case here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority finds that the arbitrator exceeded his authority in interpreting the collective bargaining agreement and in his decision to reinstate Beaupre. But the agreement gives him precisely that authority. The arbitrator's authority is set forth in Article 33, which governs grievance and arbitration. The presentation of a grievance is required to resolve \"differences ... as to the meaning or application of the provisions of the Agreement.\" Any dispute after the third step of the grievance process is submitted to the arbitrator. It is true that Article 33 contains a restriction: \"The arbitrator shall have no power to alter or modify any of the terms of this Agreement or to impose on any party a limitation or obligation not explicitly provided for in this Agreement.\" Even with such a restriction, it is commonplace that an arbitrator has authority to construe the terms of the agreement he is enforcing. <i>See, e.g., Steelworkers,</i> 363 U.S. at 599, 80 S.Ct. 1358 (\"As we [have] emphasized, the question of interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement is a question for the arbitrator. It is the arbitrator's construction which was bargained for; and so far as the arbitrator's decision concerns construction of the contract, the courts have no business overruling him because their interpretation of the contract is different from his.\"). I see nothing in this clause which prohibits the arbitrator from construing the agreement, as he has done here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority also overestimates the restrictions placed on arbitrators' ability to fashion a remedy. The majority holds that \"once an arbitrator finds that an employee has committed an act specifically listed in the collective bargaining agreement as providing just cause for termination, the arbitrator is not free to fashion a separate remedy apart from the one provided by the parties' agreement.\" <i>Opinion</i> at 34. The majority takes this to mean that once the arbitrator found insubordination in this case, he had no discretion as to remedy &#8212; he was bound to uphold the employee's termination. But this view overlooks well-established law granting the arbitrator the same level of freedom in crafting a remedy as he has in contractual interpretation. \"[W]here it is contemplated that the arbitrator will determine remedies for contract violations that he finds, courts have no authority to disagree with his honest judgment in that respect.\" <i>Misco,</i> 484 U.S. at 38, 108 S.Ct. 364. In <i>Misco,</i> it was the use or possession of controlled substances on company property which was listed as cause for discharge. The arbitrator's authority was limited to interpretation and application of terms in the contract. Nonetheless, the Court upheld the arbitrator's reinstatement of an employee terminated for drug use on company property. <i>Id.</i> at 35, 108 S.Ct. 364. The remedy of reinstatement, under a contractual regime similar to the one at issue here, was within the power of the arbitrator to fashion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admittedly, this result &#8212; which I believe to be mandated by Supreme Court precedent &#8212; poses some problems. It is not entirely satisfactory to say to employers that they can draft the collective bargaining agreement to clearly restrict the arbitrator from exercising the authority that the arbitrator applied here. The realities of what happens at the bargaining table may make this illusory. Article 32 was admirably drafted to give management some flexibility and give workers the protection that not every instance of insubordination must mean termination. It can be questioned why the price of that flexibility should be to permit an arbitrator to second guess management's judgment to be less forgiving of an employee's disobedience of a direct order. Here, the employer's unforgiving attitude is not irrational. Beaupre was asked several times, including by a more mature and senior supervisor, to comply with Arsenault's directive. But that is not the question for the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, under the law that the Supreme Court has crafted, we must defer to the arbitrator so long as he is \"even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority.\" <i>Misco,</i> 484 U.S. at 36, 108 S.Ct. 364. I think we must defer to the award. The majority's decision is thoughtful, well-written, and sensitive. The majority and I simply have a good faith disagreement about the law. To the extent <i>Georgia-Pacific</i> and <i>S.D. Warren</i> are taken to control the outcome of this case, I think it time for this court to disavow both of those cases as inconsistent with Supreme Court precedent. With regret, I find myself in dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Alternatively, remand to the arbitrator would be preferable to reversal. \"[W]here the basis for an arbitrator's decision is unclear, but the arbitrator's opinion suggests that the decision does not draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement, remand is appropriate to have the arbitrator clarify the basis for his or her decision.\"<i>Young Radiator Co. v.

Appellee is the Poland Spring Corporation (\"Poland Spring\"), which terminated Beaupre for insubordinate behavior on February 5, 2000. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Background Facts</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Poland Spring is a bottler of non-carbonated water with bottling facilities in Maine. In 2000, Leo Beaupre worked for Poland Spring as a palletizer operator. A palletizer is a machine that loads cases of bottles onto pallets and wraps the full pallets in plastic for shipping. As a palletizer operator, Beaupre was responsible for placing empty pallets on the machine, removing loaded pallets, and keeping the area around his machine clean. Since his palletizer was elevated on legs above the floor, this housekeeping task occasionally required him to remove stray bottles from under the machine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The incident which led to Beaupre's termination occurred on the night shift beginning on February 5, 2000. Beaupre's supervisor that night was Mike Arsenault, a former co-worker of Beaupre's who had recently been promoted to a supervisory role. At some point during the shift, a group of employees got together and began playfully teasing Arsenault. This group included Beaupre. The employees teased Arsenault rather crudely about his recent promotion, stating in starkly graphic terms how he was promoted for providing an imaginative variety of sexual favors to the plant manager, another male.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arsenault did not appear offended at first. In fact, at some point Arsenault actually joined in the ribbing, pretending to call up the plant manager on his radio to tell the manager that he would be right up to see him. Predictably, this spirit of jocularity did not last. According to Arsenault, the joking ended when the group received a radio call, and Arsenault assigned the employees to various work tasks. Beaupre, in contrast, testified that Arsenault suddenly \"became unglued,\" stated \"[t]hat will be enough,\" and ordered everyone back to work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the banter ended, Arsenault directed Beaupre and another worker to go into the filler room and help clean up stray bottles that were on the floor. Beaupre explained to Arsenault that due to an asthmatic condition, he could not work in the filler room where elevated levels of ozone could be present. Arsenault responded that if Beaupre could not work in the filler room, he should go clean bottles out from underneath the accumulation table. The accumulation table is a large table where filled bottles coming from the filler operation can accumulate if the palletizer operation is interrupted. The task would require Beaupre to crawl under the accumulation table, which stands on legs only a few feet off the floor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beaupre refused to follow this directive from Arsenault, telling Arsenault that his \"crawling days [were] over; it's hard for me to crawl into bed [and] hard for me to crawl out of bed.\" Arsenault then repeated his directive to Beaupre, but Beaupre continued to refuse to clean out the bottles. According to Arsenault, he then warned Beaupre that his non-compliance would constitute an act of insubordination which could result in Beaupre's termination. Nevertheless, Beaupre again refused to comply with the order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arsenault then directed Beaupre to accompany him to a conference room. On the way there Beaupre asked Arsenault whether he was really going to fire Beaupre over a bottle of water, and also asked Arsenault whether that would make him feel like a man. Despite the fact that Arsenault had now made it clear to Beaupre that he could face termination for failure to comply with Arsenault's directives, he refused to clean up the bottles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While they were walking toward the conference room, Arsenault radioed a more experienced supervisor to join them. Also joining them were two other plant employees who came at Arsenault's request as witnesses. Once again, the supervisors instructed Beaupre to go pick up the bottles as directed, and once again Beaupre refused to perform the assigned work. Beaupre was suspended pending investigation, and sent home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following day, the Union filed a grievance, alleging that Arsenault's fraternizing and joking with the plant employees was unprofessional, and that after being the subject of so much teasing, Arsenault retaliated by trying \"to embarrass [Beaupre] in front of his peers by making him crawl under a conveyer for one bottle[.]\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a post-suspension \"Step 2\" hearing, Beaupre and the Union offered two affirmative defenses explaining Beaupre's refusal to obey a directive. The Union's arguments were rejected, and following the Step 2 grievance meeting, Poland Spring converted Beaupre's suspension to a termination of employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>The Collective Bargaining Agreement</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Union submitted a grievance pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement then in existence between it and Poland Spring. Article 32 of the agreement is entitled \"Discipline and Discharge\" and provides in plain language that insubordination \"shall\" constitute just cause for termination. That Article also provides that a number of offenses may warrant a lower level of discipline prior to discharge. Insubordination, however, is not such an offense. The relevant section of Article 32 provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Discipline and discharge shall only occur for just cause. The parties agree that just cause for discharge shall include, but not be limited to, the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">8. Insubordination</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Article 33, the arbitrator's authority is expressly limited to the provisions of the Agreement. Accordingly \"[t]he arbitrator shall have no power to alter or modify any of the terms of this Agreement or to impose on any party a limitation or obligation not explicitly provided for in this Agreement.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>The Arbitrator's Award</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The factual findings of the arbitrator are substantially those previously discussed. Nevertheless, because the primary issue for our consideration is whether the arbitrator unambiguously found that Beaupre's February 5 conduct was insubordinate, it is helpful here to reproduce substantial portions of the arbitrator's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">His discussion of the termination began:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is little doubt in this case that absent some persuasive affirmative defense, [Beaupre] was guilty of the offense of insubordination on the February 5, 2000 night shift. Arsenault repeatedly ordered the grievant to clean out the scrap bottle(s) from under the accumulation table. The grievant repeatedly refused to comply with that directive, even after first Arsenault and then [another supervisor] made it clear to him that he could be terminated for so refusing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The arbitrator then evaluated the two affirmative defenses raised by the Union. First, the Union argued that Beaupre's repeated refusals to follow his supervisor's order were motivated by a sincerely held concern for his health. The arbitrator determined that this argument was not credible and that Beaupre's health was not the reason he refused to clean up the bottles. The Union alternatively argued that because the order to clean up the bottles followed so closely upon the sexual banter between Arsenault and the plant workers, Beaupre believed he might have been subjected to undue humiliation or embarrassment, or even risk of sexual assault. The arbitrator determined that this defense was entirely unpersuasive and that any apprehensions Beaupre might have had were not reasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the arbitrator began his discussion by stating that \"absent some persuasive affirmative defense [Beaupre] was guilty of the offense of insubordination,\" one might have expected the arbitrator to conclude his analysis after rejecting both affirmative defenses proffered by the Union. Instead, the arbitrator stated that there was \"one remaining issue for discussion, that being the level of discipline imposed.\" After thus declaring that he was now exploring remedial possibilities the arbitrator broke down the term \"insubordination\" into two types: straightforward insubordination, and insubordination in the presence of mitigating circumstances. The arbitrator reasoned:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Article 32] may well establish that in clear, straight-forward cases of insubordination, without mitigating considerations, the parties by agreement have established the per se rule that there is just cause for termination. However, the language of Article 32 does not state that even in the presence of mitigating circumstances, insubordination still will necessarily provide the company with just cause for termination. On the contrary, where significant mitigating considerations are present, the culpability of the employee may be diminished, and summary termination may no longer be justified. This more complex fact situation must be considered under the general, just cause standard set forth in article 32, giving due weight to the fact that the parties have agreed that a pure case of insubordination, without mitigating considerations, would provide just cause to terminate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having distinguished straightforward insubordination from insubordination with mitigating circumstances, the arbitrator placed Beaupre's claim in the latter category. The arbitrator found that Beaupre's refusal to comply with his supervisor's directive was mitigated by his supervisor's misconduct, which \"blurred the line between the supervisor and the workers.\" According to the arbitrator, once the supervisor joined in the ribbing and sexual banter, his \"improper fraternizing with the workers created an environment where one of the employees might think, at least initially, that Arsenault was not acting in his supervisory capacity, but rather only as one of the guys joking around on the shop floor.\" The arbitrator concluded that \"it was unjust for the Company to terminate the grievant for his insubordinate behavior which immediately followed.\" Nevertheless, despite the presence of mitigating circumstances, the arbitrator concluded that Beaupre's protracted refusal to comply with the directive still constituted \"insubordinate behavior.\" The arbitrator determined that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Beaupre] should have been able to figure out that Arsenault had shifted gears and was now acting in his supervisory capacity; he should have promptly followed the directives of the person he knew to be his supervisor. Furthermore... Arsenault first alone and then with the assistance of [another supervisor] gave the grievant clear warning of the fact that his behavior had become insubordinate, and gave the grievant numerous opportunities over an extended period of time to abandon his initial refusal, and to perform the work as directed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately the arbitrator concluded that while mitigating circumstances rendered the company's decision to terminate Beaupre unjust, Beaupre's insubordinate behavior over an extended period of time warranted a two week suspension without pay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Summary Judgment</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Poland Spring filed suit in district court to vacate the arbitration award.

If the language of an agreement is clear and unequivocal, an arbitrator cannot give it a meaning other than that expressed by the agreement. <i>Georgia-Pacific Co.,</i> 864 F.2d at 944.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of the arbitration award, the Union contends that the arbitrator did not unambiguously find Beaupre guilty of insubordination as that term is used in Article 32. Instead, it claims, the arbitrator found that because Beaupre's actions were mitigated by the horseplay of his supervisor, Beaupre's conduct should not be treated as insubordination per se, but should rather be evaluated under the general, \"just cause\" standard also set forth in Article 32. That is, since Beaupre's culpability was lessened by his supervisor's own misconduct, the arbitrator properly considered Beaupre's misconduct under the flexible \"just cause\" provision of Article 32, rather than the \"insubordination\" standard of that same section.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree with the Union's selective reading of the arbitration award. The award unambiguously concluded that Beaupre's misconduct on the night of February 5, 2000 constituted insubordination pursuant to Article 32 of the Agreement. The arbitrator unequivocally found: first, that a clear order was repeatedly given to Beaupre; second, that Beaupre fully understood the consequences of failure to comply with the order and yet repeatedly refused to do so; and finally, the arbitrator concluded that Beaupre's refusals to comply with the order constituted acts of insubordination subject to discipline under Article 32 of the agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, it is beyond dispute that the arbitrator found that Beaupre repeatedly refused to comply with his supervisor's directives. He concluded that \"the grievant declined to follow this directive from Arsenault. Arsenault repeated his directive to the grievant, but the grievant continued to refuse to clean out the bottles from under the accumulation table.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the arbitrator found as a fact that Beaupre fully understood the consequences of his failure to comply with his supervisor's directive. After his second refusal of the order, Beaupre accompanied Arsenault to the conference room for a disciplinary meeting. On the way there, Beaupre asked Arsenault whether \"he was the man that was going to take the grievant's job over a bottle of water, and if he did, would that make him feel like a man.\" Based on that statement, the arbitrator concluded that \"[c]ertainly, then, the grievant at least by that point understood that he could face termination for failing to comply with Arsenault's directive.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally the arbitrator concluded that Beaupre's knowing refusal to comply with the directive was \"insubordinate\" within the meaning of the Agreement. First, the arbitrator twice used the language \"insubordinate behavior\" to describe Beaupre's conduct on the night of February 5, 2000. Second, the portion of the award concerning Beaupre's culpability begins with the statement that \"[t]here is little doubt in this case that absent some persuasive affirmative defense, the grievant was guilty of the offense of insubordination.\" The award then proceeded to evaluate and reject the affirmative defenses raised by Beaupre, leaving little doubt that the arbitrator found Beaupre guilty of insubordination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon reaching the conclusion that Beaupre's conduct was insubordinate, the arbitrator was \"barred from further inquiry because such additional probing constituted `ignor[ing] the plain language of the contract.'\" <i>Georgia-Pacific Corp. v.

This Court has long held that once an arbitrator finds that an employee has committed an act specifically listed in the collective bargaining agreement as providing just cause for termination, the arbitrator is not free to fashion a separate remedy apart from the one provided by the parties' agreement. <i>See Georgia-Pacific,</i> 864 F.2d at 945; <i>S.D. Warren Co. v. United Paperworkers' Int'l Union,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"504703\"><a href=\"/opinion/504703/sd-warren-company-a-division-of-scott-paper-company-v-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">845</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir.1988); <i>Metro Chevrolet, Inc. v.

The rationale for this line of cases is simple: contractual provisions like the insubordination clause of Article 32 are bargained for and inserted precisely to take discretion away from arbitrators charged with enforcing the collective bargaining agreement. <i>Cf. Georgia-Pacific Corp.,</i> 864 F.2d at 945 (\"`[A]n arbitrator does not have unfettered discretion. He may not impose a remedy which directly contradicts the express language of the collective bargaining agreement.'\") (quoting <i>Bruno's, Inc. v. United Food &amp; Com. Wkrs.

Consequently, the plain language of Articles 32 and 33 left nothing to the arbitrator's discretion except to determine whether or not Beaupre's conduct was insubordinate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Georgia-Pacific,</i> this Court held that nearly identical contract language gave the employer the right to discharge, leaving an arbitrator no discretion to fashion a remedy different from the parties' agreed-upon level of discipline. 864 F.2d at 942, 946.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Evaluating the agreement in <i>Georgia-Pacific,</i> we determined: (1) that the agreement specifying that committing an offense of dishonesty subjected an employee to immediate discharge was unambiguous on its face; (2) that the parties inserted the provision \"precisely [to remove] optional choice on the part of the arbitrator;\" and (3) that the arbitrator had no discretion to impose another form of discipline once he found dishonesty. <i>Id.</i> at 945-46.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By enumerating offenses that are subject to immediate discharge and distinguishing those offenses from other forms of misconduct that warrant a warning prior to discharge, the parties manifested their intent to remove from the arbitrator's discretion the power to fashion his own remedy for those offenses expressly subjected to automatic discharge. <i>See S.D. Warren Co.,</i> 845 F.2d at 7-8 (finding that the purpose of an automatic discharge provision in a collective bargaining agreement reflects the parties' intent to \"remov[e] from the arbitrator the authority to determine a remedy once she concludes that a certain rule has been breached\"). If the parties intended mitigating circumstances to affect whether insubordination constitutes just cause for termination, then they would have expressed their intent in the contract. Because we find that the arbitrator determined that Beaupre was guilty of insubordination, his decision to fashion a separate remedy due to mitigating circumstances impermissibly substituted his own notions of industrial justice over those established by the contract. <i>Id.; accord Misco,</i> 484 U.S. at 38, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111965\"><a href=\"/opinion/111965/paperworkers-v-misco-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

According to this argument, when the arbitrator distinguished between straightforward insubordination and insubordination in the presence of mitigating circumstances, this was precisely the type of interpretive analysis arbitrators are regularly called on to do. Consequently, rather than fashioning a separate remedy at odds with the one provided in the contract, the arbitrator merely clarified the latently ambiguous term insubordination and determined that the conduct involved here was simply too minor to constitute insubordination as that term was intended by the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Were it in fact true that the arbitrator was merely interpreting the term insubordination, this argument might have some merit. After all, the Union correctly asserts that arbitrators have significant discretion to interpret the terms of a collective bargaining agreement. It is up to the arbitrator to decide whether a given pattern of conduct constitutes insubordination. Furthermore, the term insubordination is not defined in the agreement and is obviously susceptible to multiple interpretations. Thus, the arbitrator here certainly would have been free to decide that Beaupre's conduct was simply too minor to rise to the level of insubordination as that term is used in the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, in this case it cannot be said that the arbitrator's mitigating circumstances analysis was merely part of an interpretation of the term insubordination. First, the arbitrator never debated the meaning of the term insubordination, and concluded that Beaupre was guilty of \"insubordinate behavior\" that \"extended over a lengthy period of time.\" Second, the arbitrator did not begin his mitigating circumstances analysis until after he had established Beaupre's culpability and stated that there was only \"one remaining issue for discussion, that being the level of discipline imposed.\" Clearly, the mitigation section of the award only arose when the arbitrator was considering his remedial options, and not when he was supposedly engaged in an interpretation of the term insubordination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beaupre's situation is a regrettable one. His supervisor's misconduct undoubtedly temporarily blurred the line separating supervisor and employee, and in so doing, created a scenario in which Beaupre, insulted and hurt by Arsenault's sudden transformation from \"one of the guys\" to stern company supervisor, felt justified in refusing the order. Nevertheless, Beaupre's defiance outlasted the confusion caused by Arsenault's horseplay. He repeatedly refused a company directive even after that directive had become a formal warning delivered repeatedly by two supervisors. The arbitrator deemed this conduct insubordinate, and, having done so, lacked the contractual authority to mitigate the disciplinary action provided by the collective bargaining agreement. Consequently, the arbitration award is unenforceable and the district court's judgment is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Affirmed.</i> No costs are imposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In<i>Georgia-Pacific,</i> the agreement in issue provided that:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Any employee may be discharged for just cause.

We disagree. There are two key issues distinguishing this case from the rule of law established in <i>Keebler</i> and <i>Crafts Precision.</i></p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">First, as we explained in <i>Keebler, Keebler</i> does not apply where, as is the case here, \"the arbitrator unambiguously found that the grievant had committed conduct listed in his employment agreement as grounds for termination.\" <i>Keebler,</i> 247 F.3d at 14 n. 2.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Second, the language of the collective bargaining agreements involved in both <i>Keebler</i> and <i>Crafts Precision</i> was substantially more open and ambiguous than the contract language in Georgia-Pacific, <i>Warren</i> and the instant case. As we explained in <i>Crafts Precision,</i> the question of whether an arbitrator exceeded his authority will often turn on whether the agreement delegated open-ended discretion to the arbitrator, or instead, whether the agreement expressly provided that certain types misconduct shall constitute just cause for discharge. <i>Crafts Precision,</i> 889 F.2d at 1185; <i>compare Keebler,</i> 247 F.3d at 12-13 (noting that the agreement expressly required arbitrator to distinguish between <i>gross</i> insubordination, which would be subject to immediate discharge, from less serious instances of insubordination, which would not); <i>and Crafts Precision,</i> 889 F.2d at 1185-86 (noting that the agreement vested the employer and arbitrator with the discretion to distinguish conduct that \"<i>may</i> result in suspension\" from conduct that warrants discharge) <i>with Georgia-Pacific,</i> 864 F.2d at 942 (involving a contract which provided that any \"employee may be discharged for just cause\" and then expressly listed dishonesty as \"one of the causes for immediate discharge\"). The language in the instant agreement is nearly-identical to that of <i>Georgia-Pacific</i> in that it enumerates misconduct which may warrant discharge without warning. That is, it provides that \"just cause for discharge <i>shall include</i>... insubordination.\" (Emphasis added). Unlike <i>Keebler</i> and <i>Crafts-Precision,</i> the instant agreement lacks any language that would authorize an arbitrator to distinguish between degrees of insubordination, or permit an arbitrator to select from a variety of disciplinary remedies.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BOUDIN, Chief Judge (Concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leo Beaupre, then an employee of Poland Spring Corp. at its facility in Maine, refused in February 2000 several direct instructions from two supervisors to pick up some bottles scattered under a table. The company's contract with Beaupre's union provides that \"[d]iscipline and discharge shall occur only for just cause.

However, the arbitrator ruled that under the contract \"mitigating considerations\" permitted the arbitrator to conclude that termination was too severe a penalty; finding mitigation here &#8212; for example, tasteless jokes by Beaupre's direct supervisor &#8212; the arbitrator ruled that the penalty should be reduced to two weeks' suspension without pay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirming the district court, the panel majority now holds that the arbitrator exceeded his authority in directing Beaupre's reinstatement.

In effect, the arbitrator takes over the court's role of initial construction; but there remains a vaguely defined limit: a reviewing court may still conclude that the arbitrator is re-writing the terms instead of construing them. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the arbitrator could permissibly have read the contract to mean that some acts of disobedience constitute \"insubordination\" within the meaning of the contract and that other, less severe acts &#8212; although literally disobedience &#8212; do not. \"Insubordination\" is not defined in the contract nor is it self-defining and, reading the provision in context, a judge (and even more surely an arbitrator) would be likely to exclude trivial disobedience, such as a refusal to light the supervisor's cigarette. Consider that lack of cleanliness is also listed as a basis for discharge under this contract, but certainly a smudge on a nose would not qualify for discharge. So, taking account of the severity of the disobedience is, within broad limits, surely a part of the arbitrator's authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed <i>de novo,</i> it is a more difficult question whether the present contract can be read to limit management's right to discharge an insubordinate employee where there exist \"mitigating considerations.\" Of course, lack of the severity of disobedience could be viewed as a mitigating consideration; but the arbitrator's claim in this case is not focused on lack of severity. Rather, he claimed and exercised a broader mandate to take into account anything that might equitably bear on whether a discharge for disobedience seemed fair and proportionate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most judges, interpreting this contract for themselves, would probably reject this latter reading. Taking the contract as a whole, it explicitly reserves disciplinary authority to management, save as constrained by other provisions. Most judges would likely take the \"just cause\" provision quoted above as licensing management to discharge an employee who was patently \"insubordinate,\" even if he had served the company loyally for a decade and had a sick wife at home and a child in college. The contract does not say that discharge for insubordination is permitted only where \"just\" or \"fair.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even so, the parties in this case empowered an <i>arbitrator</i> to interpret the contract and that includes the power to adopt readings that a judge might reject if no arbitrator were involved. Does this include a reading that allows the arbitrator to say that disobedience is \"insubordination\" if there are adequate \"mitigating considerations\" that have nothing to do with whether the disobedience was clear, deliberate, and pertinent to the employee's duties? This is a stretch of language, to be sure, but whether it goes too far to be a permissible <i>arbitrator</i> reading is something about which reasonable judges might differ.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This debatable issue has been resolved in this circuit. In two different cases, this court has ruled that contracts, similarly structured as that at issue here, give management a right to discharge an employee guilty of a listed offense, and that an arbitrator cannot mitigate the penalty because of ameliorative circumstances. <i>See Georgia-Pacific Corp. v.

The discharged employees had possessed marijuana at the plant, but the arbitrator ruled that the sanction was too severe. <i>Id.</i> The <i>Warren</i> decision held that the arbitrator had exceeded his power. <i>Id.</i> at 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A similar conclusion was reached in <i>Georgia-Pacific,</i> 864 F.2d at 942-43: the contract permitted discharge for \"dishonesty,\" and the employee had reported himself unable to work for medical reasons and had instead participated in a golf tournament. The arbitrator ordered reinstatement based on the employee's many years of service. <i>Id.</i> at 944. Again, the court held that the arbitrator was improperly rewriting the contract. <i>Id.</i> at 946. Thereafter, this court several times acknowledged that <i>S.D.

The first principles, themselves derived from Supreme Court precedent, are inevitably quite general statements about the scope of and limits to arbitrator authority; some language helps Beaupre, some helps the company, and none of it in a debatable case like this one would be decisive if we were deciding this case without any governing circuit precedent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the Supreme Court's <i>holdings,</i> only <i>Misco</i> has facts arguably close to our own.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> In <i>Misco,</i> 484 U.S. at 41-42, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111965\"><a href=\"/opinion/111965/paperworkers-v-misco-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

But the Court's rationale is somewhat cryptic and turned in some measure on a peculiar stipulation of the parties that the issue in dispute was the existence of \"just cause,\" which was said to be open to arbitral determination. <i>Id.</i> Read evenhandedly, <i>Misco</i> is of some help to Beaupre but also could itself be distinguished.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But this panel is not free to resolve this case based on first principles or a reading of <i>Misco</i> favorable to Beaupre. <i>S.D.

The presentation of a grievance is required to resolve \"differences ... as to the meaning or application of the provisions of the Agreement.\" Any dispute after the third step of the grievance process is submitted to the arbitrator. It is true that Article 33 contains a restriction: \"The arbitrator shall have no power to alter or modify any of the terms of this Agreement or to impose on any party a limitation or obligation not explicitly provided for in this Agreement.\" Even with such a restriction, it is commonplace that an arbitrator has authority to construe the terms of the agreement he is enforcing. <i>See, e.g., Steelworkers,</i> 363 U.S. at 599, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106086\"><a href=\"/opinion/106086/steelworkers-v-enterprise-wheel-car-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1358</span></a></span> (\"As we [have] emphasized, the question of interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement is a question for the arbitrator. It is the arbitrator's construction which was bargained for; and so far as the arbitrator's decision concerns construction of the contract, the courts have no business overruling him because their interpretation of the contract is different from his.\"). I see nothing in this clause which prohibits the arbitrator from construing the agreement, as he has done here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority also overestimates the restrictions placed on arbitrators' ability to fashion a remedy. The majority holds that \"once an arbitrator finds that an employee has committed an act specifically listed in the collective bargaining agreement as providing just cause for termination, the arbitrator is not free to fashion a separate remedy apart from the one provided by the parties' agreement.\" <i>Opinion</i> at 34. The majority takes this to mean that once the arbitrator found insubordination in this case, he had no discretion as to remedy &#8212; he was bound to uphold the employee's termination. But this view overlooks well-established law granting the arbitrator the same level of freedom in crafting a remedy as he has in contractual interpretation. \"[W]here it is contemplated that the arbitrator will determine remedies for contract violations that he finds, courts have no authority to disagree with his honest judgment in that respect.\" <i>Misco,</i> 484 U.S. at 38, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111965\"><a href=\"/opinion/111965/paperworkers-v-misco-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></a></span>. In <i>Misco,</i> it was the use or possession of controlled substances on company property which was listed as cause for discharge. The arbitrator's authority was limited to interpretation and application of terms in the contract. Nonetheless, the Court upheld the arbitrator's reinstatement of an employee terminated for drug use on company property. <i>Id.</i> at 35, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111965\"><a href=\"/opinion/111965/paperworkers-v-misco-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></a></span>. The remedy of reinstatement, under a contractual regime similar to the one at issue here, was within the power of the arbitrator to fashion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admittedly, this result &#8212; which I believe to be mandated by Supreme Court precedent &#8212; poses some problems. It is not entirely satisfactory to say to employers that they can draft the collective bargaining agreement to clearly restrict the arbitrator from exercising the authority that the arbitrator applied here. The realities of what happens at the bargaining table may make this illusory. Article 32 was admirably drafted to give management some flexibility and give workers the protection that not every instance of insubordination must mean termination. It can be questioned why the price of that flexibility should be to permit an arbitrator to second guess management's judgment to be less forgiving of an employee's disobedience of a direct order. Here, the employer's unforgiving attitude is not irrational. Beaupre was asked several times, including by a more mature and senior supervisor, to comply with Arsenault's directive. But that is not the question for the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, under the law that the Supreme Court has crafted, we must defer to the arbitrator so long as he is \"even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority.\" <i>Misco,</i> 484 U.S. at 36, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111965\"><a href=\"/opinion/111965/paperworkers-v-misco-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></a></span>. I think we must defer to the award. The majority's decision is thoughtful, well-written, and sensitive. The majority and I simply have a good faith disagreement about the law. To the extent <i>Georgia-Pacific</i> and <i>S.D. Warren</i> are taken to control the outcome of this case, I think it time for this court to disavow both of those cases as inconsistent with Supreme Court precedent. With regret, I find myself in dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Alternatively, remand to the arbitrator would be preferable to reversal. \"[W]here the basis for an arbitrator's decision is unclear, but the arbitrator's opinion suggests that the decision does not draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement, remand is appropriate to have the arbitrator clarify the basis for his or her decision.\"<i>Young Radiator Co. v.
