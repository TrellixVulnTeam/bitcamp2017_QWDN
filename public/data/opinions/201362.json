Odom,\n\nformer general agents for the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance\n\nCompany (\"MassMutual\"), filed suit against MassMutual on behalf of\n\nthemselves and all other similarly situated MassMutual general\n\nagents.     The   claims    are   Massachusetts        state   law    claims   and\n\njurisdiction is premised on diversity.              Plaintiffs participated in\n\na non-qualified deferred compensation plan; they allege that the\n\nplan was    managed    by   MassMutual       in   violation    of   the   contract\n\nunderlying the plan, the implied covenant of good faith and fair\n\ndealing    in   the   contract,   and    a    fiduciary    duty     running    from\n\nMassMutual to plan participants.             They also allege violations of\n\nMassachusetts General Laws Chapter 93A, which prohibits unfair and\n\ndeceptive trade practices.\n\n     Specifically,      McAdams    and       Odom    allege    that   MassMutual\n\nunlawfully assessed a tax charge against participants' deferred\n\ncompensation earnings that was designed to fully offset the tax\n\ncosts to MassMutual from running the plan.                Under the contract,\n\nthey argue, no such charge can be assessed, and even if such a\n\ncharge could be assessed, the charge assessed by MassMutual was, in\n\nreality, far too high merely to offset MassMutual's tax costs.\n\nMassMutual admits that such a tax charge was assessed but argues\n\nthat the contract allowed it and that the amount of the charge was\n\nreasonable.\n\n     After discovery, the district court dismissed all of McAdams's\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fand Odom's claims on summary judgment and also, after denying a\n\nmotion for class certification, dismissed all of the actions of\n\nthirty related plaintiffs.     Because the undisputed record shows\n\nthat MassMutual's actions remained well within the bounds of\n\ndiscretion permitted to MassMutual by the contract and by the\n\nunderlying covenant of good faith and fair dealing, we now affirm\n\nthe district court.\n\n                                 I.\n\n     We recount all facts in the light most favorable to the party\n\nopposing summary judgment, McAdams and Odom in this case.   Dwan v.\n\nCity of Boston, 329 F.3d 275, 277 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n     McAdams and Odom worked as general agents for MassMutual in\n\nTexas; they ran and owned fairly large (forty- to eighty-person)\n\nagencies that sold insurance and other products for the company.\n\nBoth of their general agencies sold deferred compensation plans to\n\ntheir customers.      These general agents were not classified as\n\nemployees of MassMutual and in fact were closer to independent\n\ncontractors than to employees -- for example, the general agents\n\ndid not receive a salary from MassMutual and did not send profit\n\nand loss statements for their general agencies to MassMutual,\n\nalthough MassMutual did pick up certain expenses, such as rent.\n\nA. The Deferred Compensation Plan\n\n     MassMutual first established a deferred compensation plan for\n\ngeneral agents in 1967; this first plan allowed for accumulation of\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fdeferred amounts of earned income at a fixed interest rate.              The\n\nplan at issue here was created in 1970.          The new plan, unlike the\n\nold, provided an option, should MassMutual wish to provide it, of\n\ninvesting deferred compensation in stocks (a higher-risk, higher-\n\nreturn option) rather than investing in a fixed income account.\n\nMcAdams first began deferring compensation with the plan in 1983;\n\nOdom in 1986.    All of the related plaintiffs (whose claims in the\n\nputative class have been joined in this consolidated appeal) were\n\ngeneral agents who deferred compensation under this plan. At least\n\n117 general agents were participants in this plan at some point.\n\n     The deferred compensation plan was created and advertised as\n\na perk for the general agents.      As one MassMutual employee noted in\n\na communication with the general agents, \"There is no purely\n\ncorporate reason for [this] plan.         It is provided for the benefit\n\nof our General Agents solely.\"           Like most deferred compensation\n\nplans,   the   general   purposes   of    this   one   were   to   provide   a\n\nconvenient \"vehicle to save additional funds for retirement\" and,\n\nmost importantly, to \"shelter current contributions from current\n\nincome taxation . . . and to allow assets to accumulate tax free.\"\n\nPersonal income tax would only need to be paid by participants on\n\nthis compensation when it was actually disbursed to the general\n\nagents (upon retirement or death); in the meantime the deferred\n\ncompensation could accumulate income on the investment free and\n\nclear of the personal income tax.\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f     Because the general agents are not \"employees\" as that term is\n\nused by the IRS, MassMutual could not create a \"qualified\" deferred\n\ncompensation plan for the general agents but instead had to create\n\na \"non-qualified\" plan.          This had important tax consequences.\n\nMoney can accumulate in qualified plans, which are considered\n\nseparate entities from the employer, without any adverse tax\n\nconsequences for the employer at any time, but the same is not true\n\nof non-qualified plans.     The money invested in non-qualified plans\n\nis considered part of the employer's assets and thus the employer\n\nhas to pay tax on the funds invested in the plan (although the\n\nemployer   may   get   a   tax   deduction   later,   when   the   deferred\n\ncompensation is actually disbursed to the general agents).\n\n     Article V of the plan's standard contract, which was signed by\n\nMassMutual and by all the plan participants (including McAdams and\n\nOdom), provided that MassMutual could choose two different ways of\n\ndealing with compensation deferred under the plan: it could either\n\ninvest such compensation separately from its general reserves and\n\nassets (say, in a trust or mutual fund) or it could commingle this\n\ncompensation with its general reserves and assets.\n\n     Article V explains how investment earnings would be credited\n\nto general agents' accounts under each of these two choices.            The\n\nfirst paragraph of the Article notes that if MassMutual invests the\n\ndeferred compensation separately, then\n\n     it shall credit to the General Agent's account from time to\n     time whatever net earnings the assets so invested have\n\n                                    -5-\n\f     produced. Net earnings from separate investments for purposes\n     of this Agreement shall mean gross earnings, including but not\n     limited to, interest, dividends, realized and unrealized\n     appreciation or loss in the value of such investments, less\n     all expenses and taxes attributable to the making, carrying\n     and liquidation of such investments, including but not limited\n     to, an appropriate accrual of taxes for unrealized\n     appreciation in the value of the investments. [MassMutual]\n     alone shall determine the amount of net earnings that will be\n     credited   to   the  General   Agent's   account;   and   such\n     determination of net earnings, including the determination as\n     to charges for expenses and taxes, shall be final.\n\nThus, the Article explicitly indicates that when MassMutual invests\n\nmoney deferred under the plan in separate accounts, MassMutual is\n\nallowed   to   deduct    any   expenses,      including    taxes,     that   those\n\ninvestments cause.       The purpose here seems to be to ensure that\n\nMassMutual does not lose money by administering any separate\n\ninvestments under the plan: if these investments lead to any\n\nexpenses or taxes, these will be paid for by the plan participants\n\nand not by the plan administrator, MassMutual.\n\n     The third and last paragraph of Article V discusses the\n\ncrediting of earnings to deferred compensation accounts when this\n\ncompensation is not separately invested but instead is kept within\n\nthe company's general reserves and assets.                MassMutual will then\n\n\"credit   interest      on   that   portion   .   .   .   of   the   account   not\n\nrepresented by separate investments of [MassMutual] assets.                    Such\n\ninterest shall be credited to the account from time to time, in\n\nlieu of net earnings from separate investments of [MassMutual]\n\nassets, at a rate determined from time to time by the Company.\"\n\nThe interpretation of this provision lies at the heart of the\n\n                                       -6-\n\fcurrent dispute between McAdams, Odom, and MassMutual.\n\nB. MassMutual's Administration of the Plan\n\n     MassMutual     chose     to    invest    the     deferred     compensation\n\nseparately for only a few years early on, from 1970 through 1975;\n\nduring this period the money was invested in a separate trust\n\nadministered by a bank. From 1976 onward, MassMutual ceased making\n\nseparate investments of deferred money. Instead, participants were\n\ngenerally offered two options.         First, they could \"shadow\" certain\n\nequity accounts (Oppenheimer funds, for example).                In this shadow\n\noption, the rate of return on the participants' accounts for a\n\ngiven year would track whatever was the rate of return for the\n\nshadowed account.     In other words, MassMutual would pretend the\n\nmoney had actually been invested in the shadowed account even\n\nthough it had not been.\n\n     Second, participants could instead choose a fixed interest\n\noption, in which their accounts would be credited with a fixed rate\n\nof return every year.       This fixed rate seems to have been designed\n\nto be equivalent with the return on long-term, money-based (low-\n\nrisk) accounts (like bonds or certificates of deposit).\n\n     In   1983,   MassMutual       began   imposing   a   tax    charge   on   the\n\nearnings of deferred compensation that used the shadow account\n\noption.   This tax charge varied from 1983 to 1993, but tended to\n\nhover around 30% (although it was much lower in a few years).                  From\n\n1994 to 2001, the rate of the tax charge on this option remained\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fconstant at 34.16%.   MassMutual began in 1983 taking into account\n\ntax charges on the credited earnings of deferred compensation\n\nplaced in the fixed account option; a formal tax charge for this\n\noption was put in place in 1987.    This formal rate was 40% for\n\n1987, 34% for 1988 through 1993, and 35% for 1994 through 1999.\n\n     These tax charges reduce the rate of earnings on deferred\n\nmoney: the tax charge is multiplied by the gross rate of earnings\n\n(either the periodic rate of return on the shadowed account or the\n\nfixed interest rate determined by MassMutual) to determine a net\n\nearnings rate that is actually credited to the general agents'\n\naccounts.   Thus, a nine percent gross rate of return would be\n\nreduced to about six percent after the tax charge.    If a general\n\nagent chose the shadow option and the shadowed fund were to have\n\nlost money during a given period, then the result of the tax charge\n\nwould actually be to reduce the agent's loss.    No tax charge is\n\nassessed against the principal; only the rate of earnings is\n\nreduced by a tax charge.    The rate of the tax charge has been\n\nroughly equal to MassMutual's marginal tax rate.1\n\n\n     1\n      The tax charge for the fixed interest rate option has merely\nequaled MassMutual's federal corporate income tax rate on simple\nincome. MassMutual thus simplified by assuming that all deferred\nmoney placed in the fixed interest option was held as cash (rather\nthan bonds or something else). In reality, this money was held as\npart of MassMutual's general cash reserves, which apparently\nreflected a mix of asset types.\n     The tax charge on the shadow option was a bit more complex;\nthe company followed the practice of treating this money as though\nit was actually invested in a shadowed fund, and so the tax charge\non all shadowed accounts equaled an approximate \"weighted average\"\nof the federal marginal tax rates on the various types of income\n                                -8-\n\f       MassMutual has stated many times that the purpose of this tax\n\ncharge is roughly to offset the tax costs to MassMutual from\n\nrunning the plan and to place it in a revenue-neutral position\n\nrelative to where it would be if it instead paid compensation to\n\nthe general agents immediately.            It is true that MassMutual is\n\nlater able to deduct compensation to its general agents, but only\n\nwhen   it   actually   pays   out   this    compensation.   The   deferred\n\ncompensation plan, by forcing MassMutual to keep general agent\n\ncompensation in its coffers longer than it otherwise would, burdens\n\nit with two additional tax costs: 1) it gets a deduction on the\n\nprincipal only a number of years down the road, rather than\n\nimmediately, and 2) it is now forced to pay taxes on any earnings\n\nthat are accumulated on this extra principal.           The tax charge is\n\ndesigned to offset these tax costs to MassMutual.\n\n       The undisputed facts show that MassMutual's tax charges have,\n\nin a rough sense, correctly achieved this stated goal of tax\n\nneutrality from MassMutual's perspective.            A November 13, 1986\n\n\n\nfound in all of these funds, such as dividend income, capital\ngains, and bond income, as well as simple income. In treating this\nincome as though it were actually being taxed at the same rate as\nthe shadowed funds, MassMutual was, of course, using a fiction.\nThis shadowed money was really held in MassMutual's general\nreserves, and thus its effective tax rate was dependent on the mix\nof assets in those general reserves.      But the fiction was not\nunfair; it treated general agents approximately the same way they\nwould have been treated if they had actually put their money in the\nfund that was being shadowed.\n     At any rate, this difference in method of calculation had\nlittle impact on the ultimate rate: the rates for the fixed\ninterest and shadow options were generally similar.\n                                -9-\n\fmemorandum from Douglas Jangraw, an actuary for MassMutual who was\n\nheavily involved with calculating the tax charge, states that\n\nbecause   MassMutual      ultimately   gets      a    deduction   for    \"interest\n\ncredited\" to participant accounts (when that money is actually paid\n\nout), \"the current tax charge is probably excessive and should\n\neither be eliminated or reduced.\"           But this analysis was either a\n\nmistake   or,    as    Jangraw   explains   in       an   affidavit    and   in   his\n\ndeposition, reflected the results of a partial analysis that\n\nconsidered only the tax cost due to credited interest and not the\n\ntax cost due to the principal.         Several other memoranda written by\n\nJangraw, on October 21, 1986, December 4, 1986, January 10, 1987,\n\nand December 1, 1993, all concluded and clearly demonstrated that\n\nthe tax charge was appropriately calculated when both tax costs to\n\nMassMutual      (the   principal    cost    and      the    earnings    cost)     are\n\nconsidered.2\n\n     A January 26, 1995 memorandum from Jangraw stated that the tax\n\ncharge, although it did not make a general agent any worse off from\n\n\n\n     2\n      The record has one other piece of evidence which plaintiffs\nargue demonstrates that the tax charge was incorrectly calculated.\nAn outside consultant hired by MassMutual during a 1992 committee\nreview of deferred compensation plans stated, in a \"position\npaper,\" that \"we feel that the way the rate is currently calculated\nresults in a rate which is too low.       We do not feel that the\nultimate company tax deduction was taken into account when the rate\nis calculated.\"    This point, which is made only cursorily and\nwithout any supporting documentation in the paper, simply seems to\nbe based on a misunderstanding of the charge, as noted by Margaret\nSperry, a manager and lawyer for MassMutual, who corrected the\nconsultant about his mistake. It is, in any event, insufficient to\nsupport the inferences needed to withstand summary judgment.\n                                -10-\n\fa   tax   perspective   than   if   she   had   taken   her   compensation\n\nimmediately rather than deferring it, did \"essentially put[] the\n\nparticipant in a neutral position relative to where he or she would\n\nhave been had they taken their compensation immediately.\"           But an\n\nattachment to this memo, along with two other documents, a 1994\n\nfact sheet sent from MassMutual to its participating general agents\n\nand the \"written version\" of a 1994 discussion between a MassMutual\n\nofficer and a group of general agents, clarifies this remark\n\nconsiderably.    The 1994 fact sheet notes that the tax-charged\n\ndeferred compensation plan would not always be better for employees\n\nthan taking compensation immediately; however, it would be better\n\nwhenever \"[the general agent's] marginal tax rate is greater than\n\nthe 34.16% tax charge.\"        In other words, it would generally be\n\nbetter whenever the total of the general agent's marginal personal\n\nfederal income tax rate, marginal personal state income tax rate,\n\nand marginal payroll tax rate were greater than the rate of the tax\n\ncharge.    This seems to have been a common situation.\n\n      The tax charge was a rough calculation that reflected some\n\nsimplification;3 it is undisputed in the record that certain things\n\nwere not considered in the calculation.         First, the charge did not\n\ntake into account the fact that unrealized gains in equities were\n\n\n     3\n      Jangraw noted in his deposition testimony that the purpose of\nthe plan was to keep the cost to the company \"approximately\"\nneutral while at the same time not having too high \"an\nadministrative burden on the plan administrators.\" There was thus\nsome interest by MassMutual in not making the plan unreasonably\ncomplex.\n                                -11-\n\fnot taxed until those gains were realized (the stocks were actually\n\nsold).    There was a reason for that.         Three memoranda from Jangraw\n\n-- dated March 15, 1993, January 26, 1995, and April 26, 1995 --\n\noffer several reasons why unrealized gain had not historically been\n\nfactored into the calculations.              First, the effect on the tax\n\ncharge is \"not that significant\": the January 1995 memo stated that\n\nstudies had shown that the tax charge percentage would change by\n\nonly about 3%, from 34.16% to \"roughly 31%.\"               This change would\n\nhave only a very small impact on the net interest rate credited to\n\nthe    general   agents'    accounts.        Jangraw   also    stressed       that\n\ncalculating      this    sort   of   gain    would   add   quite    a   bit     of\n\nadministrative complexity to the calculation of the tax charge;\n\nthe reduction would depend on the specific characteristics of funds\n\nand on the length of deferral for individual general agents.\n\n       The tax charge has also never taken into account a certain tax\n\nthat the company was sometimes subject to, the add-on tax.              This is\n\na special tax, assessed between 1984 and 2000 and paid by mutual\n\nfund     companies,     based   on   surplus   equity.        The   liabilities\n\nestablished by the plan reduce the amount of the surplus and\n\ntherefore theoretically might justify a lower tax charge.                 A 1987\n\ninternal committee (including Jangraw, Margaret Sperry, and four\n\nother MassMutual employees) concluded that the tax charge was\n\ngenerally correctly calculated, except for the add-on tax factor,\n\nwhich the committee felt should be included in the tax charge\n\ncalculations.      Some calculations in that report suggested that\n                                      -12-\n\freflecting the add-on tax might result in a 1.50% increase in the\n\nnet return rate of earnings that general agents received.             There\n\nwas testimony from Sperry and Jangraw that these calculations were\n\n\"hypothetical\" and were based on an \"assumption\" that Jangraw said\n\nhe did not remember and Sperry said was probably not backed by any\n\ndata.    Sperry stated that the add-on tax was zero for 10 of the 17\n\nyears between 1984 and 2000, and was less than one percent for five\n\nmore years.          So only in two years did the add-on tax exceed one\n\npercent.       Jangraw testified that a conscious decision was made not\n\nto adopt the committee's recommendation by including the add-on\n\ntax,     but    he    does   not   remember   why.   The   answer   may   be\n\nsimplification of the calculation.\n\n       One simplification adopted by the company worked clearly to\n\nthe advantage of the general agents. MassMutual did not reduce net\n\nrates of return for state taxes.\n\n        Aside from the tax charge, the evidence demonstrates that for\n\nthe fixed interest rate option but not the shadow account option,\n\nMassMutual also reduced the gross rates of returns that it posted\n\nto the general agents' accounts by two other, very small charges.\n\nFirst, there was an administrative charge designed to offset\n\nMassMutual's costs of administration. This ran at 20 basis points,\n\nresulting in a two-tenths of one percent reduction in the net fixed\n\ninterest rate. For all non-qualified benefit plans that MassMutual\n\nadministered, this apparently resulted in an annual provision of\n\nabout $200,000 for the approximately five people who spent the\n                                       -13-\n\fmajority of their time working on these plans, which seemed \"quite\n\nreasonable\" to Jangraw in a December 1, 1993 memorandum.\n\n      Second, there was a charge which had been called conflicting\n\nthings: it was sometimes referred to as a \"profit charge\" and\n\nsometimes as a \"risk charge.\"            Jangraw and another actuary (and\n\nsenior     vice-president)       with   MassMutual,     Isadore      Jermyn,     both\n\nexplained    that    the     purpose    of   this   charge     is   not   to     allow\n\nMassMutual to make a profit, but rather to offset the risk of rapid\n\nasset loss associated with holding additional capital; this offset\n\nwas   required       by    the     National      Association        of    Insurance\n\nCommissioners.      The amount of this risk or profit charge was also\n\nquite small, running at 40 basis points before 1993 and 50 basis\n\npoints after 1993.           Jangraw concluded in his December 1, 1993\n\nmemorandum, after performing some calculations and considering the\n\n\"risk-based capital requirements associated with these [deferred\n\ncompensation] accounts,\" that the \"40-50 basis point [risk] charge\n\ndoes not seem unreasonably high.\"               Thus the total effect of the\n\nexpense and risk charges was only to subtract six- or seven-tenths\n\nof one percent from the gross rate of return.\n\n      Significantly, for the fixed interest rate option, the rate\n\nwas then increased above its otherwise net value (after tax,\n\nexpense, and risk charges) by a subsidy.                  The amount of this\n\nsubsidy has varied widely, but it hovered between 254 basis points\n\nand   48   basis    points    between    1987    and   1999.        It   would    have\n\napproximately at least canceled out the expense and risk charges in\n                               -14-\n\fall but one year, 1999.\n\n     It   was     common    for   insurance      companies        with     deferred\n\ncompensation plans for general agents to impose tax charges.                  Some\n\n1994 research      found   that   the   rate   of    return      that    MassMutual\n\ncredited on its fixed interest rate option was about the same as\n\nthe rates of return for four of the five insurance companies that\n\noffered similar plans (the other company offered a substantially\n\nhigher rate of return).           MassMutual employees were attuned to\n\nstandard industry practice and considered it when setting their\n\nrates of return: this was one purpose for the subsidy.\n\n     In   1999,    MassMutual     discontinued       the   tax    charge    due    to\n\ncomplaints      from    general   agents,      but    only    for       prospective\n\ncontributions; for equity reasons, contributions made before 1999\n\nwould continue to be reduced by the amount of the tax charge.\n\nC. MassMutual's Efforts to Inform Agents about the Tax Charge\n\n     There is no evidence that MassMutual ever tried to hide the\n\nfact that it was assessing a tax charge; there is, in fact,\n\nconsiderable evidence that it communicated what it was doing to\n\nthe general agents.\n\n     This is very clear from 1993 onward.                  Throughout 1993 and\n\n1994, the tax charge was a constant topic of discussion between\n\nMassMutual and the general agents at the various meetings of the\n\ngeneral agents.        In 1993, a MassMutual employee wrote a letter to\n\nall general agent participants in the deferred compensation plan,\n\nexplaining the development of the credited rates of return.                       The\n                              -15-\n\fletter clearly identifies the tax charge as an issue, explains its\n\nrationale, and suggests that general agents \"check with their\n\ninvestment/financial advisors\" to see if the plan is beneficial to\n\nthem.\n\n     In 1994, the company sent two letters, on July 15 and December\n\n20, discussing the tax charge in question and answer format.   The\n\nJuly 15 memorandum answered the question, \"What is the tax charge?\n\nHow is it determined?,\" explained why a more complex, fund-specific\n\ntype of tax charge was not used on the shadow account option, and\n\nnoted that in the event of losses on a shadowed account, the effect\n\nof the tax charge would actually be to reduce the losses.      The\n\nDecember 20, 1994 memorandum went further; it included explanations\n\nof the three issues described above and also explained precisely\n\nwhen participating in the plan was likely to be worthwhile for\n\nagents.   In general, the memo emphasized, both through words and\n\nthrough a tabular illustration, that participation was likely to be\n\na good idea whenever the rate of the tax charge was lower than the\n\nparticipant's own, personal marginal tax rate (including federal\n\nincome, state income, and payroll taxes).4    The memorandum also\n\n\n\n     4\n      The memo actually noted that the issue of whether the plan\nwas beneficial to the general agents was a bit more complex. The\ndiscussion included \"some important qualifiers\": 1) \"changes in tax\nrates have a big impact on the financial advantages of [the plan],\"\n2) because the plan is nonqualified, the general agents would have\nmere unsecured general creditor status if MassMutual were to\ndeclare bankruptcy, and 3) general agents should put as much money\nas possible into 401(k) plans before putting money into this plan,\nbecause 401(k)'s have more advantageous tax treatment.\n                                -16-\n\fstressed that \"[i]n the final analysis, the decision to participate\n\nor not, should be made after fully considering all of your tax and\n\nretirement planning strategies.\"\n\n     The evidence on MassMutual's communications before 1993 with\n\nits general agents is considerably sparser.    One employee, Robert\n\nMassaro, testified that he began working with the compensation\n\ncommittee of the general agents' association in 1986; thereafter,\n\nhe would refer issues dealing with the tax charge back to the\n\ncompany when general agents would raise them \"[f]rom time to time.\"\n\nThere was some more specific evidence that the tax charge was the\n\nsubject of discussion between some general agents (perhaps only\n\nretired general agents) and company employees at a conference in\n\nthe late 1980s.   A letter sent from MassMutual to Odom's general\n\nagency in 1989 referenced this conference and explained the tax\n\ncharge.\n\n     In a letter, McAdams stated that he became aware of the tax\n\ncharge a \"few years\" after 1983.   A 1990 letter from MassMutual to\n\nMcAdams in March 1990 noted in passing that \"we adjust the unit\n\nvalues for taxes\" and this indicated to McAdams that a tax charge\n\nwas applied.   McAdams certainly understood the tax charge by 1991\n\nor 1992, when he discussed the issue at length with MassMutual's\n\nCEO at a general agents' conference.    Finally, the company always\n\nsent periodic balance statements to each of its participants; these\n\nstatements did not include any reference to the rate or dollar\n\nvalue of the tax charge, however.      They merely showed the total\n                               -17-\n\fgain or loss on a participant's account.\n\n                                         II.\n\n     McAdams     and    Odom    filed    suit       against    MassMutual     in   U.S.\n\nDistrict Court for the District of Massachusetts on December 28,\n\n1999, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated.\n\nThey alleged that MassMutual's use of the tax charge and related\n\ncharges constituted a breach of contract, a breach of the covenant\n\nof good faith and fair dealing, a breach of fiduciary duty, fraud,\n\nnegligent   misrepresentation,          and     a   violation     of   Massachusetts\n\nGeneral Laws Chapter 93A, section 11.\n\n     MassMutual moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state\n\na claim.    Senior Judge Freedman granted this motion in part and\n\ndenied it in part on December 13, 2000.               McAdams v. Mass. Mut. Life\n\nIns. Co., No. Civ. A.99-30284-FHF, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22068 (D.\n\nMass. December 13, 2000).             The court held that on the contract\n\ncount,   the    \"language,      at    best    [for    MassMutual],        presents   an\n\nambiguity      with    regard    to     whether      the      Agreement    authorizes\n\nMassMutual to deduct the tax charge from funds invested in the\n\ngeneral reserves and assets.\"            Id. at *12.           The court emphasized\n\nthat the agreement expressly provides for a deduction of taxes\n\nwhere deferred accounts are separately invested, but the portion of\n\nthe agreement dealing with situations where the deferred accounts\n\nare not separately invested but instead are placed in MassMutual's\n\nown general reserves and assets does not contain this express\n\nlanguage.      The court also noted the principle that ambiguous\n                                -18-\n\flanguage is to be construed against the drafter, in this case\n\nMassMutual.     Id.\n\n     The court held that plaintiffs' breach of covenant of good\n\nfaith and fair dealing count also had to stand, because the\n\nallegation that MassMutual breached the contract and \"capitalized\n\non [its] position as the administrators of the [p]lan would amply\n\njustify recovery.\"     Id. at *14.       The court refused to dismiss the\n\nfiduciary duty count as well, holding that McAdams and Odom had\n\nalleged enough facts to withstand dismissal of the fiduciary claim\n\nbecause \"the defendants maintained the dominant voice in the\n\nmanagement of the deferred compensation incomes.\"              Id. at *17.\n\n     The district court did dismiss the Chapter 93A count because\n\nChapter 93A does not apply to \"purely private transactions.\"                 This\n\nplan was a purely private transaction because it was never offered\n\nto the general public and only applied to a small subset of general\n\nagents.   Id. at *20-*21.       The district court also dismissed the\n\nfraud and negligent misrepresentation counts as pled without the\n\nrequisite specificity of fact.         Id. at *19-*20.     The court granted\n\nleave to amend the complaint, but McAdams and Odom did not do so.\n\n     McAdams     and   Odom     then    moved    to   certify    the       class;\n\ncertification    was   denied   by     Judge   Freedman   on   May   15,    2002.\n\nMcAdams v. Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co., No. Civ. A.99-30284-FHF, 2002\n\nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 9944 (D. Mass. May 15, 2002).             On June 13, 2002,\n\nthirty-five former general agents moved for leave to join or\n\nintervene in the McAdams/Odom suit.             Judge Freedman denied that\n                              -19-\n\fmotion on March 26, 2003.     On April 7, 2003, thirty of these\n\nthirty-five filed individual actions in district court based on the\n\nsame basic legal theories.\n\n     After a period for discovery, MassMutual moved for summary\n\njudgment on all remaining claims, and District Court Judge Ponsor\n\ngranted the motion in its entirety on March 26, 2004.    The court\n\nfocused on what it saw as the central issue, the problem of\n\ncontract interpretation.   It held that the language in the general\n\nreserves section of the contract authorizing MassMutual to credit\n\n\"interest . . . to the account from time to time . . . at a rate\n\ndetermined by the Company\" was unambiguously \"a broad grant [of\n\ndiscretion] to MassMutual . . . . [It] gives the defendants\n\nexpansive discretion to determine the rate in any rational manner\n\nit sees fit.\"   The express mention in the contract of deductions\n\nfor taxes and expenses where money is separately invested and the\n\nabsence of this express language in the section dealing with\n\nsituations where the money is kept in MassMutual's general reserves\n\ndid not properly lead to an application of the expressio unius est\n\nexclusio alterius maxim to deny MassMutual's ability to deduct\n\ntaxes from these types of accounts because the \"glaring omission of\n\nany limitation on [MassMutual's] discretion . . . trump[ed] any\n\nattempt to attribute significance to a lack of an itemization of\n\nfactors.\"   The court concluded that \"[a]bsent demonstrable bad\n\nfaith, fraud or egregiously unreasonable behavior,\" MassMutual\n\ncould do whatever it wanted with the rate of return on the deferred\n                               -20-\n\ffunds.\n\n       The court concluded that the claims for breach of fiduciary\n\nduty and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing also\n\nfailed.     The   court     noted   that    it   was   \"questionable\"    whether\n\nMassMutual was a fiduciary, but even if it was, neither fiduciary\n\nduties nor the duties imposed by the covenant of good faith and\n\nfair   dealing    were    violated.        Plaintiffs    had   offered   only   a\n\n\"difference in opinion\" as to how to calculate the rate of return;\n\nthere was no showing that MassMutual's method was a result of bad\n\nfaith.     Moreover, the court emphasized the \"transparency\" of\n\nMassMutual's conduct, and the fact that McAdams and Odom continued\n\nto defer even after they were well aware of the tax charge.\n\nFinally, the court concluded that McAdams's own claims would be\n\ndismissed regardless because of a release he signed with MassMutual\n\nin 1998.\n\n       On May 5, 2004, after having issued an order to show cause why\n\nsummary judgment should not be granted, the district court granted\n\nsummary judgment against the thirty general-agent plaintiffs in the\n\nrelated cases as well.\n\n       All of the plaintiffs filed timely appeals, and the appeals of\n\nthe thirty related plaintiffs were consolidated with the appeal of\n\nMcAdams and Odom by this court.        The plaintiffs have not raised the\n\nissue of fraud or negligent representation before us; this claim is\n\nwaived.    The claims of breach of contract, breach of covenant of\n\ngood   faith   and   fair    dealing, breach       of    fiduciary   duty,   and\n                                    -21-\n\fviolation of Chapter 93A are before us.\n\n                               III.\n\n     All of the claims were denied either on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion\n\nto dismiss or on summary judgment; our review is de novo.

Breach of contract\n\n     Whether a contract is ambiguous is an issue to be determined\n\nby the court.   Alison v. Byard, 163 F.3d 2, 6 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\nOrdinarily, contracts are construed by a court \"as a matter of law\"\n\nunless there are material disputes as to extrinsic facts bearing on\n\nthe correct interpretation. Fenoglio v. Augat, Inc., 254 F.3d 368,\n\n370 (1st Cir. 2001) (quoting Principal Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Racal-\n\nDatacom, Inc., 233 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2000)).   This is true even\n\nin \"close cases\"; the jury does not become involved when words and\n\ncontext alone are used, but only when extrinsic evidence is at\n\nissue.   See Fishman v. LaSalle Nat'l Bank, 247 F.3d 300, 303 (1st\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      The choice of law clause in the agreement states that\nMassachusetts state law applies to \"[a]ll questions pertaining to\nthe construction, validity and effect of the provisions of this\nAgreement.\" In the briefs before this court, both sides have cited\nMassachusetts law for all of their claims, including the fiduciary\nduty and 93A claims. Because of this implicit agreement between\nthe parties that Massachusetts law should apply to all claims, we\napply it in this diversity case without inquiring further. Hershey\nv. Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Sec. Corp., 317 F.3d 16, 20 (1st\nCir. 2003).\n                                -22-\n\fCir. 2001).6     Words are not viewed in isolation within a contract.\n\nThe meaning of a contract cannot be understood merely by \"isolating\n\nwords and interpreting them as though they stood alone.\"            Starr v.\n\nFordham,   648    N.E.2d    1261,   1269   (Mass.   1995)   (quoting   Boston\n\nElevated Ry. v. Metro. Transit Auth., 83 N.E.2d 445, 451 (Mass.\n\n1949)).    Contracts must, in other words, be read as a whole.            Id.\n\n     Even if a contract might arguably appear ambiguous from its\n\nwords alone, the decision remains with the judge if the alternative\n\nreading    is    inherently    unreasonable    when   placed   in   context.\n\nContract interpretation under Massachusetts law depends heavily on\n\ncontext and recognizes that words can have different meanings in\n\ndifferent contexts.        See id.; Shea v. Bay State Gas Co., 418 N.E.2d\n\n597, 600 (Mass. 1981).        Thus, agreements should be construed \"with\n\nreference to the situation of the parties when they made it and to\n\nthe objects sought to be accomplished.\"         Starr, 648 N.E.2d at 1269\n\n(quoting Bryne v. City of Gloucester, 8 N.E.2d 170, 171 (Mass.\n\n1937) (internal quotation marks omitted)). This sort of contextual\n\n\n\n     6\n      Even where there are ambiguities in the language and there is\nrelevant extrinsic evidence, there is support for the view that\nunder Massachusetts law the judge decides the issue if all of this\nextrinsic evidence is undisputed, even if the outcome is debatable.\nSee Fishman, 247 F.3d at 303; Atwood v. City of Boston, 37 N.E.2d\n131, 134 (Mass. 1941).      And of course, judges interpret even\nambiguous contracts involving disputed extrinsic evidence where the\nevidence is so one-sided that no reasonable finder of fact could\ndecide for the alternative interpretation. Boston Five Cents Sav.\nBank v. Sec'y of Hous. and Urban Dev., 768 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir.\n1985). These rules about extrinsic evidence are not necessary to\ndecide this case, because the meaning of this contract is clear\nafter looking at its language and context.\n                                -23-\n\fevidence is not the kind of evidence that is intended to be barred\n\nby the parol evidence rule if no ambiguity is found; rather,\n\ncontext should be used as a tool to find unambiguous meaning in the\n\nfirst place.   See Robert Indus., Inc. v. Spence, 291 N.E.2d 407,\n\n409-10 (Mass. 1973); see also SAPC, Inc. v. Lotus Dev. Corp., 921\n\nF.2d 360, 361 n.2 (1st Cir. 1991).     On the basis of such context,\n\nthis court has often affirmed entry of summary judgment in contract\n\ncases.   See Nat'l Tax Inst., Inc. v. Topnotch at Stowe Resort &\n\nSpa, No. 03-1924, 2004 WL 2494967, at *3-*4 (1st Cir. Nov. 5,\n\n2004); Fishman, 247 F.3d at 302-03.\n\n     Here, importantly, we see no material disputes as to extrinsic\n\nfacts. The contract may be interpreted on the face of the document\n\nitself against a contextual understanding of the nature of various\n\ntypes of deferred compensation plans.\n\n     Plaintiffs argue the contract is not ambiguous and it does not\n\npermit the assessment of any tax charges when separate investments\n\nare made.   They also argue that if there are any ambiguities, they\n\nmust be construed against MassMutual.      Only as a last resort do\n\nthey argue that if there are any ambiguities, and they cannot be\n\nresolved against MassMutual, then a jury should resolve them.\n\n     The precise language being construed is contained in paragraph\n\nthree of Article V and provides:\n\n     If during any period . . ., [MassMutual] . . . makes no\n     separate investments of its property, . . . it shall then\n     credit interest on that portion or all of the account not\n     represented by separate investments of [MassMutual] assets.\n     Such interest shall be credited to the account from time to\n                                -24-\n\f     time, in lieu of net earnings from separate investments of\n     [MassMutual] assets, at a rate determined from time to time by\n     [MassMutual] . . . .\n\nThis language must be understood in the context of paragraph one of\n\nthat article, which governed separate investments:\n\n     If [MassMutual] invests its property separately . . . , it\n     shall credit to the General Agent's account from time to time\n     whatever net earnings the assets so invested have produced.\n     Net earnings from separate investments for purposes of this\n     Agreement shall mean gross earnings, including but not limited\n     to, interest, dividends, realized and unrealized appreciation\n     or loss in the value of such investments, less all expenses\n     and taxes attributable to the making, carrying, and\n     liquidation of such investments, including but not limited to,\n     an appropriate accrual of taxes for unrealized appreciation in\n     the value of the investments.       [MassMutual] alone shall\n     determine the amount of net earnings that will be credited to\n     the General Agent's account; and such determination of net\n     earnings, including the determination as to charges for\n     expenses and taxes, shall be final.\n\n     The district court found paragraph three to be unambiguous:\n\n\"It is a broad grant to MassMutual to determine, as it sees fit,\n\nthe rate of interest credited to the accounts of the general\n\nagents.\"   More specifically, the court determined that the clause\n\nrequiring the company to credit interest \"at a rate determined from\n\ntime to time by [MassMutual]\" permitted MassMutual to deduct\n\nexpenses and taxes in determining that interest.     We agree with\n\nthis narrower formulation. Specifically, we reject the plaintiffs'\n\nargument that in the face of an explicit contractual grant of\n\nauthority to the company, the company could not deduct expenses and\n\ntaxes unless the contract permitted it to do so in haec verba.\n\n     Plaintiffs point to the term \"interest,\" ignoring the phrase\n\nthat interest is to be credited \"at a rate determined from time to\n                               -25-\n\ftime by the company.\"         \"Interest\" has been defined as \"[t]he\n\ncompensation fixed by agreement or allowed by law for the use or\n\ndetention of money . . . esp., the amount owed to a lender in\n\nreturn for the use of borrowed money.\"          Black's Law Dictionary 829\n\n(8th ed. 2004).    The term does not preclude deduction of expenses\n\nincurred in determining the rate of return.             Here the deferred\n\ncompensation is invested with the common assets of the company.\n\nThe making of investments itself involves costs and any sensible\n\nrate of return accounts for those costs.          The fact that this is an\n\nunqualified plan means that the company has additional taxes it\n\nmust pay (unlike a qualified plan).            The decision to account for\n\nthose taxes in setting the rate of interest is within the literal\n\nlanguage affording the company the discretion to set the rate of\n\ninterest.\n\n      The reasonableness of this reading is reinforced by the fact\n\nthat the company is explicitly granted the authority in the first\n\nparagraph to deduct from net earnings, when funds are invested\n\nseparately, \"all expenses and taxes attributable to the making,\n\ncarrying and liquidation of such investments.\"               The clause in\n\nparagraph three gives the company even broader authority. It would\n\nbe unreasonable to interpret that broader grant of authority in\n\nparagraph three as not encompassing powers explicitly authorized in\n\nthe   narrower   grant   of   authority   in    paragraph   one.   In   this\n\nsituation, the principle of expressio unius est exclusio alterius\n\nhas no place.\n                                   -26-\n\f     Nothing in industry custom operates to render this clear\n\nreading suspect.   Most others in the industry follow the same\n\npractices as MassMutual.   At least one company does not, but we do\n\nnot know its precise contractual arrangements.\n\n     The canon of construing an ambiguous contract against the\n\ndrafter does not change the result.   First, there is no ambiguity.\n\nSecond, as said in National Tax Institute,\n\n     [T]he canon is a qualified one . . . a default rule that\n     arguably has more force where the parties differ in\n     sophistication or where standard forms are used (e.g.,\n     insurance contracts). In any event, the canon has little to\n     do with actual intentions and should only be used, as a last\n     resort, if other aids to construction leave the case in\n     equipoise.\n\nNat'l Tax Inst., 2004 WL 2494967, at *2.     Here, the parties are\n\nextremely sophisticated and there is no need to turn to a last\n\nresort canon.\n\nB. Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing\n\n     McAdams and Odom respond that MassMutual's assessment of the\n\ntax charge was a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and\n\nfair dealing in two senses: that there could be no consideration of\n\ntaxes at all in the setting of the interest rate and that the\n\nparticular rates set violate the covenant.     Under Massachusetts\n\nlaw, every contract implies such a covenant. Anthony's Pier Four,\n\nInc. v. HBC Assocs., 583 N.E.2d 806, 820 (Mass. 1991).   The purpose\n\nof the covenant is not to add terms to a contract; indeed, it may\n\n\n\n\n                               -27-\n\fnot do so.7\n\n       The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court recently reinforced\n\nthis understanding of the covenant.           In Uno Restaurants, Inc. v.\n\nBoston Kenmore Realty Corp., 805 N.E.2d 957 (Mass. 2004), the court\n\nheld that a directed verdict should enter against a claim of breach\n\nof the covenant.       The court stressed that\n\n       [t]he covenant may not . . . be invoked to create rights and\n       duties not otherwise provided for in the existing contractual\n       relationship, as the purpose of the covenant is to guarantee\n       that the parties remain faithful to the intended and agreed\n       expectations of the parties in their performance.\n\nId. at 964; see also Sparks v. Fid. Nat'l Title Ins. Co., 294 F.3d\n\n259, 274 (1st Cir. 2002) (\"An implied covenant . . . imposes on the\n\nparties the obligation . . . to act in good faith to accomplish the\n\npurposes of their agreement.             It does not, however, add new\n\nsubstantive      obligations    to    their   contractual   undertakings.\")\n\n(citation omitted).\n\n       This contract, read in light of the covenant of good faith and\n\nfair       dealing,   constrains     MassMutual's   contractual   discretion\n\nsomewhat.       See 2 E. Allan Farnsworth, Farnsworth on Contracts §\n\n7.17, at 365 (3d ed. 2004) (covenant is often used to limit\n\ndiscretion where the terms of the contract give one side discretion\n\nover another).        There is obviously a requirement that the company\n\n\n\n       7\n      We note that the breach of implied covenant claim alleged\nhere is not the theory recognized in Fortune v. Nat'l Cash Register\nCo., 364 N.E.2d 1251, 1255-59 (Mass. 1977). There is no claim here\nthat plaintiffs' employment was terminated to avoid paying them\nbenefits earned and due.\n                               -28-\n\fact in good faith; the lack of good faith can be inferred from\n\n\"unreasonable[ness] under all the circumstances.\"                  Nile v. Nile,\n\n734 N.E.2d 1153, 1160 (Mass. 2000); see Krapf v. Krapf, 786 N.E.2d\n\n318,   324-25    (Mass.    2003).      While,    as    MassMutual         urges,   an\n\n\"arbitrary   and      capricious\"    use   of   discretion     would      certainly\n\nviolate the covenant, the Massachusetts courts have also used the\n\nlanguage of \"unreasonableness,\" which is the usage we employ.                      See\n\nNile, 734 N.E.2d at 1160.\n\n       The core of the covenant is to ensure that one party does not\n\ndeprive another of the \"fruits of the contract.\"                   Anthony's Pier\n\nFour, Inc., 583 N.E.2d at 820 (quoting Drucker v. Roland Wm. Jutras\n\nAssocs., Inc., 348 N.E.2d 763, 765 (Mass. 1976) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted)) (emphasis added).            \"The covenant is preserved so\n\nlong as neither party injures the rights of another to reap the\n\nbenefits prescribed by the terms of the contract.\" Uno Rests., 805\n\nN.E.2d at 964 (emphasis added).\n\n       The general agents argue that such deprivation is precisely\n\nwhat happened here.       They argue that by assessing the tax charge,\n\nMassMutual      was   wiping   out   the   whole      point   of    the    deferred\n\ncompensation plan, which was to allow the general agents to invest\n\nmoney tax free until it was actually distributed to participants.\n\nThe agents believe that the company's imposition of an annual tax\n\ncharge based on its corporate tax liability completely frustrated\n\nthis purpose and deprived the agents of the benefits of this type\n\nof plan.\n                                      -29-\n\f      This argument is misplaced because it focuses merely on the\n\nphrase \"deferred compensation plan\" and not on the contractual\n\nlanguage of the second sentence of paragraph three.                       We have\n\ninterpreted      the   contract     as   giving    MassMutual       discretion   to\n\nconsider taxes, expenses and other costs in setting the rate of\n\ninterest.      A proper exercise of this discretion cannot deprive the\n\nagents of the fruit of the contract.                As Uno Restaurants makes\n\nclear, the covenant cannot be used to contradict clear contractual\n\nterms.   The agents' first argument on the covenant claim was thus\n\nresolved in our discussion of the contract claim.\n\n      There remains the possibility that MassMutual might have\n\nexercised its discretion to set a rate so unreasonably as to\n\nviolate the covenant.             Plaintiffs make exactly that argument.\n\nMcAdams and Odom argue that unreasonableness is shown by the fact\n\nthat MassMutual was told that its basic methodology for calculating\n\nthe tax charge was wrong and resulted in an excessive charge on\n\nseveral occasions; its continuing use of the methodology showed bad\n\nfaith.   But the evidence indisputably shows that the basic method\n\nwas, after several minor simplifications, correct; the occasional\n\ncriticisms of it were themselves based on errors.\n\n      The general agents next stress that the refusal to reduce the\n\ntax   charge    due    to   the   add-on   tax    and   the   tax    treatment   of\n\nunrealized gain shows MassMutual's bad faith.                   The evidence is\n\nundisputed that MassMutual made these two simplifications because\n\nit understood that they cut down on the company's administrative\n                                         -30-\n\fcosts without having a significant impact on the tax charge rate.\n\nAnd not all of the simplifications ran against the general agents:\n\nthe failure to consider state corporate income taxes when setting\n\nthe tax charge probably aided general agents considerably.\n\n        The agents also unsuccessfully argue that the expense and\n\nrisk/profit charges on the fixed interest option violate the\n\ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing.   In theory these are, like\n\nthe tax charge, reasonable attempts to allow MassMutual to break\n\neven and avoid losses from administering the deferred compensation\n\nplan.     In practice, the assessment of these charges has not been\n\nunreasonable; the charges have been approximately correct after\n\nsome sensible simplifications. At any rate, these two charges have\n\nbeen quite small and usually have been far more than offset by the\n\nsubsidy added by MassMutual to fixed interest rate returns.\n\n        We note finally that a lack of transparency, with other\n\nevidence, may be important evidence in supporting a breach of the\n\ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing.     Bad faith may be shown\n\npartially by the fact that a party is trying to hide what she is\n\ndoing from the other party in order to disadvantage that party.\n\nFor example, where a party uses discretionary rights under a\n\ncontract pretextually, as cover for a hidden and illicit motive, an\n\ninference of bad faith may be warranted.   See Anthony's Pier Four,\n\nInc., 583 N.E.2d at 820-21; Starr v. Fordham, 648 N.E.2d 1261, 1266\n\n(Mass. 1995) (finding breach of covenant on partnership contract\n\nwhere partners unfairly reduced one partner's share by fabricating\n                                -31-\n\fa list of negative factors and by \"select[ing] performance criteria\n\nin order to justify the lowest possible payment to the plaintiff\").\n\nHere, MassMutual was reasonably transparent about what it was doing\n\nand why.     The 1993 and 1994 communications marked a substantial\n\nattempt to inform the general agents about the workings of the tax\n\ncharge and about whether it would still be a good idea for the\n\nagents to participate in the plan.          Even before 1993, MassMutual\n\nwas not trying to hide anything; there is evidence that it tried to\n\ncommunicate the tax charge to the general agents on some occasions\n\nin the 1980s.\n\n     Based on the evidence, no reasonable finder of fact could\n\nconclude in the plaintiffs' favor on the covenant claim.\n\nC. Breach of Fiduciary Duty\n\n     Under Massachusetts law, the question of whether one party\n\nowes fiduciary duties to another is a question of fact.             Indus.\n\nGen. Corp. v. Sequoia Pac. Sys. Corp., 44 F.3d 40, 44 (1st Cir.\n\n1995).     Key factors in this fact-specific inquiry include one\n\nparty's lack of sophistication relative to another on the relevant\n\nissues, and whether one party has granted another party a great\n\ndeal of discretion.     Patsos v. First Albany Corp., 741 N.E.2d 841,\n\n849-51 (Mass. 2001).\n\n     We need not decide whether there is a disputed issue of fact\n\nconcerning    the   existence   of   a   fiduciary   relationship   between\n\nMassMutual and any or all of the general agents, because even if\n\nfiduciary duties existed, there was no breach.         The core fiduciary\n                                     -32-\n\fobligation in this sort of context is a duty on MassMutual to\n\nexercise any discretionary power that it has in good faith, with\n\nprudence and after serious consideration, and reasonably according\n\nto the purposes of the agreement and standard fiduciary principles.\n\nSee Ventura v. Ventura, 555 N.E.2d 872, 875 (Mass. 1990); Briggs v.\n\nCrowley, 224 N.E.2d 417, 421-22 (Mass. 1967); Copp v. Worcester\n\nCounty    Nat'l       Bank,   199   N.E.2d   200,    203     (Mass.    1964).        This\n\nobligation was met here: the tax charge was both created and\n\napplied in a manner that was well thought out and reasonable in\n\nlight    of     the    plan's   purpose,     and     there    was     no    bad    faith.\n\nSometimes, there may be a breach of a fiduciary duty if the\n\nfiduciary fails to disclose certain information.                           Puritan Med.\n\nCtr.,    Inc.    v.    Cashman,     596   N.E.2d     1004,    1010     (Mass.      1992).\n\nMassMutual has satisfied any such obligation by making, as already\n\nexplained, considerable efforts to pass information about the tax\n\ncharge on to the general agent participants.\n\nD. Chapter 93A\n\n        Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 93A, section 11 protects\n\nagainst unfair and deceptive trade practices.                         A dispute must\n\ninvolve a \"commercial transaction\" to fall into the reach of the\n\nstatute. Szalla v. Locke, 657 N.E.2d 1267, 1270 (Mass. 1995).                            The\n\nMassachusetts         Supreme   Judicial     Court    has    interpreted          this    to\n\ninclude only transactions that are \"offered generally by a person\n\nfor sale to the public in a business transaction\" and to exclude\n\ntransactions that \"are principally 'private in nature,'\" such as a\n                                          -33-\n\fdispute between employer and employee.            Manning v. Zuckerman, 444\n\nN.E.2d 1262, 1265-66 (Mass. 1983).            MassMutual argues that the\n\ndispute at issue here is private in nature, and thus no 93A claim\n\ncan lie; plaintiffs counter that such a claim is stated because\n\nthey are independent contractors and not employees.                 Whether an\n\nindependent contractor can recover for a 93A violation is unclear\n\nunder Massachusetts law.      See Schinkel v. Maxi-Holding, Inc., 565\n\nN.E.2d 1219, 1224-25 (Mass. App. Ct. 1991).             The issue may hinge\n\nnot on the label of \"independent contractor,\" but on a fact-\n\nspecific, case-by-case analysis into the type of relationship that\n\nthe independent contractor has with the company at issue.                      See\n\nLinkage Corp. v. Trs. of Boston Univ., 679 N.E.2d 191, 207 (Mass.\n\n1997) (corporation that worked for a university as, according to\n\nthe contract, independent contractor rather than employee or agent,\n\ncould maintain 93A action against university); Benoit v. Landry,\n\nLyons & Whyte Co., 580 N.E.2d 1053, 1053 (Mass. App. Ct. 1991)\n\n(real    estate   salesman   could   not    use   93A   even   if   he   was   an\n\nindependent contractor).       Because the state law is unclear, we\n\ndecline to decide the 93A claim on this ground.\n\n        Even if the transaction between MassMutual and the general\n\nagents was commercial in nature and the claim should have survived\n\na Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim,\n\nMassMutual's actions in this case did not violate Chapter 93A, as\n\namply demonstrated by the summary judgment record.              Plaintiffs do\n\nnot argue that there is any additional evidence pertinent to this\n                                     -34-\n\fclaim that is not on this record.       Conduct that is \"'in disregard\n\nof known contractual arrangements' and intended to secure benefits\n\nfor the breaching party\" falls afoul of Chapter 93A.         Anthony's\n\nPier Four, Inc. v. HBC Assocs., 583 N.E.2d 806, 821 (Mass. 1991)\n\n(quoting Wang Labs., Inc. v. Bus. Incentives, Inc., 501 N.E.2d\n\n1163, 1167 (Mass. 1986)).   Here, MassMutual did not disregard the\n\ncontract and behaved reasonably in its application of the contract.\n\nA 93A claim is based on unfairness or deception, not a mere\n\n\"difference of opinion\": \"a good faith dispute as to whether money\n\nis owed, or performance of some kind is due, is not the stuff of\n\nwhich a c. 93A claim is made.\"    Duclersaint v. Fed. Nat'l Mortgage\n\nAss'n, 696 N.E.2d 536, 540 (Mass. 1998). MassMutual's actions were\n\nall fair, reasonable, in good faith, and transparent; the general\n\nagents' differences of opinions do not come close to raising a\n\nviolation of Chapter 93A.\n\n     Given the way we have resolved the case, we need not consider\n\nthe general agents' motion to certify the class, MassMutual's\n\nstatute of limitations defense, or MassMutual's assertion that\n\nMcAdams released his own claims.\n\n                                 IV.\n\n     The district court's grant of summary judgment on all claims\n\nfor MassMutual is affirmed.      So ordered.     Costs are awarded to\n\nMassMutual.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -35-\n\f-36-\n\f",

McAdams and Farrell D. Odom, former general agents for the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company (\"MassMutual\"), filed suit against MassMutual on behalf of themselves and all other similarly situated MassMutual general agents. The claims are Massachusetts state law claims and jurisdiction is premised on diversity. Plaintiffs participated in a non-qualified deferred compensation plan; they allege that the plan was managed by MassMutual in violation of the contract underlying the plan, the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the contract, and a fiduciary duty running from MassMutual to plan participants. They also allege violations of Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 93A, which prohibits unfair and deceptive trade practices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Specifically, McAdams and Odom allege that MassMutual unlawfully assessed a tax charge against participants' deferred compensation earnings that was designed to fully offset the tax costs to MassMutual from running the plan. Under the contract, they argue, no such charge can be assessed, and even if such a charge could be assessed, the charge assessed by MassMutual was, in reality, far too high merely to offset MassMutual's tax costs. MassMutual admits that such a tax charge was assessed but argues that the contract allowed it and that the amount of the charge was reasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After discovery, the district court dismissed all of McAdams's and Odom's claims on summary judgment and also, after denying a motion for class certification, dismissed all of the actions of thirty related plaintiffs. Because the undisputed record shows that MassMutual's actions remained well within the bounds of discretion permitted to MassMutual by the contract and by the underlying covenant of good faith and fair dealing, we now affirm the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recount all facts in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment, McAdams and Odom in this case. <i>Dwan v. City of Boston,</i> 329 F.3d 275, 277 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McAdams and Odom worked as general agents for MassMutual in Texas; they ran and owned fairly large (forty- to eighty-person) agencies that sold insurance and other products for the company. Both of their general agencies sold deferred compensation plans to their customers. These general agents were not classified as employees of MassMutual and in fact were closer to independent contractors than to employees &#8212; for example, the general agents did not receive a salary from MassMutual and did not send profit and loss statements for their general agencies to MassMutual, although MassMutual did pick up certain expenses, such as rent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>A. The Deferred Compensation Plan</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MassMutual first established a deferred compensation plan for general agents in 1967; this first plan allowed for accumulation of deferred amounts of earned income at a fixed interest rate. The plan at issue here was created in 1970. The new plan, unlike the old, provided an option, should MassMutual wish to provide it, of investing deferred compensation in stocks (a higher-risk, higher-return option) rather than investing in a fixed income account. McAdams first began deferring compensation with the plan in 1983; Odom in 1986. All of the related plaintiffs (whose claims in the putative class have been joined in this consolidated appeal) were general agents who deferred compensation under this plan. At least 117 general agents were participants in this plan at some point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The deferred compensation plan was created and advertised as a perk for the general agents. As one MassMutual employee noted in a communication with the general agents, \"There is no purely corporate reason for [this] plan. It is provided for the benefit of our General Agents solely.\" Like most deferred compensation plans, the general purposes of this one were to provide a convenient \"vehicle to save additional funds for retirement\" and, most importantly, to \"shelter current contributions from current income taxation ... and to allow assets to accumulate tax free.\" Personal income tax would only need to be paid by participants on this compensation when it was actually disbursed to the general agents (upon retirement or death); in the meantime the deferred compensation could accumulate income on the investment free and clear of the personal income tax.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the general agents are not \"employees\" as that term is used by the IRS, MassMutual could not create a \"qualified\" deferred compensation plan for the general agents but instead had to create a \"non-qualified\" plan. This had important tax consequences. Money can accumulate in qualified plans, which are considered separate entities from the employer, without any adverse tax consequences for the employer at any time, but the same is not true of non-qualified plans. The money invested in non-qualified plans is considered part of the employer's assets and thus the employer has to pay tax on the funds invested in the plan (although the employer may get a tax deduction later, when the deferred compensation is actually disbursed to the general agents).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Article V of the plan's standard contract, which was signed by MassMutual and by all the plan participants (including McAdams and Odom), provided that MassMutual could choose two different ways of dealing with compensation deferred under the plan: it could either invest such compensation separately from its general reserves and assets (say, in a trust or mutual fund) or it could commingle this compensation with its general reserves and assets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Article V explains how investment earnings would be credited to general agents' accounts under each of these two choices. The first paragraph of the Article notes that if MassMutual invests the deferred compensation separately, then</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">it shall credit to the General Agent's account from time to time whatever net earnings the assets so invested have produced. Net earnings from separate investments for purposes of this Agreement shall mean gross earnings, including but not limited to, interest, dividends, realized and unrealized appreciation or loss in the value of such investments, less all expenses and taxes attributable to the making, carrying and liquidation of such investments, including but not limited to, an appropriate accrual of taxes for unrealized appreciation in the value of the investments. [MassMutual] alone shall determine the amount of net earnings that will be credited to the General Agent's account; and such determination of net earnings, including the determination as to charges for expenses and taxes, shall be final.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the Article explicitly indicates that when MassMutual invests money deferred under the plan in separate accounts, MassMutual is allowed to deduct any expenses, including taxes, that those investments cause. The purpose here seems to be to ensure that MassMutual does not lose money by administering any separate investments under the plan: if these investments lead to any expenses or taxes, these will be paid for by the plan participants and not by the plan administrator, MassMutual.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third and last paragraph of Article V discusses the crediting of earnings to deferred compensation accounts when this compensation is not separately invested but instead is kept within the company's general reserves and assets. MassMutual will then \"credit interest on that portion ... of the account not represented by separate investments of [MassMutual] assets. Such interest shall be credited to the account from time to time, in lieu of net earnings from separate investments of [MassMutual] assets, at a rate determined from time to time by the Company.\" The interpretation of this provision lies at the heart of the current dispute between McAdams, Odom, and MassMutual.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>B. MassMutual's Administration of the Plan</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MassMutual chose to invest the deferred compensation separately for only a few years early on, from 1970 through 1975; during this period the money was invested in a separate trust administered by a bank. From 1976 onward, MassMutual ceased making separate investments of deferred money. Instead, participants were generally offered two options. First, they could \"shadow\" certain equity accounts (Oppenheimer funds, for example). In this shadow option, the rate of return on the participants' accounts for a given year would track whatever was the rate of return for the shadowed account. In other words, MassMutual would pretend the money had actually been invested in the shadowed account even though it had not been.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, participants could instead choose a fixed interest option, in which their accounts would be credited with a fixed rate of return every year. This fixed rate seems to have been designed to be equivalent with the return on long-term, money-based (low-risk) accounts (like bonds or certificates of deposit).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1983, MassMutual began imposing a tax charge on the earnings of deferred compensation that used the shadow account option. This tax charge varied from 1983 to 1993, but tended to hover around 30% (although it was much lower in a few years). From 1994 to 2001, the rate of the tax charge on this option remained constant at 34.16%. MassMutual began in 1983 taking into account tax charges on the credited earnings of deferred compensation placed in the fixed account option; a formal tax charge for this option was put in place in 1987. This formal rate was 40% for 1987, 34% for 1988 through 1993, and 35% for 1994 through 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These tax charges reduce the rate of earnings on deferred money: the tax charge is multiplied by the gross rate of earnings (either the periodic rate of return on the shadowed account or the fixed interest rate determined by MassMutual) to determine a net earnings rate that is actually credited to the general agents' accounts. Thus, a nine percent gross rate of return would be reduced to about six percent after the tax charge. If a general agent chose the shadow option and the shadowed fund were to have lost money during a given period, then the result of the tax charge would actually be to reduce the agent's loss. No tax charge is assessed against the principal; only the rate of earnings is reduced by a tax charge. The rate of the tax charge has been roughly equal to MassMutual's marginal tax rate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MassMutual has stated many times that the purpose of this tax charge is roughly to offset the tax costs to MassMutual from running the plan and to place it in a revenue-neutral position relative to where it would be if it instead paid compensation to the general agents immediately. It is true that MassMutual is later able to deduct compensation to its general agents, but only when it actually pays out this compensation. The deferred compensation plan, by forcing MassMutual to keep general agent compensation in its coffers longer than it otherwise would, burdens it with two additional tax costs: 1) it gets a deduction on the principal only a number of years down the road, rather than immediately, and 2) it is now forced to pay taxes on any earnings that are accumulated on this extra principal. The tax charge is designed to offset these tax costs to MassMutual.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The undisputed facts show that MassMutual's tax charges have, in a rough sense, correctly achieved this stated goal of tax neutrality from MassMutual's perspective. A November 13, 1986 memorandum from Douglas Jangraw, an actuary for MassMutual who was heavily involved with calculating the tax charge, states that because MassMutual ultimately gets a deduction for \"interest credited\" to participant accounts (when that money is actually paid out), \"the current tax charge is probably excessive and should either be eliminated or reduced.\" But this analysis was either a mistake or, as Jangraw explains in an affidavit and in his deposition, reflected the results of a partial analysis that considered only the tax cost due to credited interest and not the tax cost due to the principal. Several other memoranda written by Jangraw, on October 21, 1986, December 4, 1986, January 10, 1987, and December 1, 1993, all concluded and clearly demonstrated that the tax charge was appropriately calculated when both tax costs to MassMutual (the principal cost and the earnings cost) are considered.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A January 26, 1995 memorandum from Jangraw stated that the tax charge, although it did not make a general agent any worse off from a tax perspective than if she had taken her compensation immediately rather than deferring it, did \"essentially put[] the participant in a neutral position relative to where he or she would have been had they taken their compensation immediately.\" But an attachment to this memo, along with two other documents, a 1994 fact sheet sent from MassMutual to its participating general agents and the \"written version\" of a 1994 discussion between a MassMutual officer and a group of general agents, clarifies this remark considerably. The 1994 fact sheet notes that the tax-charged deferred compensation plan would not always be better for employees than taking compensation immediately; however, it would be better whenever \"[the general agent's] marginal tax rate is greater than the 34.16% tax charge.\" In other words, it would generally be better whenever the total of the general agent's marginal personal federal income tax rate, marginal personal state income tax rate, and marginal payroll tax rate were greater than the rate of the tax charge. This seems to have been a common situation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The tax charge was a rough calculation that reflected some simplification;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> it is undisputed in the record that certain things were not considered in the calculation. First, the charge did not take into account the fact that unrealized gains in equities were not taxed until those gains were realized (the stocks were actually sold). There was a reason for that. Three memoranda from Jangraw &#8212; dated March 15, 1993, January 26, 1995, and April 26, 1995 &#8212; offer several reasons why unrealized gain had not historically been factored into the calculations. First, the effect on the tax charge is \"not that significant\": the January 1995 memo stated that studies had shown that the tax charge percentage would change by only about 3%, from 34.16% to \"roughly 31%.\" This change would have only a very small impact on the net interest rate credited to the general agents' accounts. Jangraw also stressed that calculating this sort of gain would add quite a bit of administrative complexity to the calculation of the tax charge; the reduction would depend on the specific characteristics of funds and on the length of deferral for individual general agents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The tax charge has also never taken into account a certain tax that the company was sometimes subject to, the add-on tax. This is a special tax, assessed between 1984 and 2000 and paid by mutual fund companies, based on surplus equity. The liabilities established by the plan reduce the amount of the surplus and therefore theoretically might justify a lower tax charge. A 1987 internal committee (including Jangraw, Margaret Sperry, and four other MassMutual employees) concluded that the tax charge was generally correctly calculated, except for the add-on tax factor, which the committee felt should be included in the tax charge calculations. Some calculations in that report suggested that reflecting the add-on tax might result in a 1.50% increase in the net return rate of earnings that general agents received. There was testimony from Sperry and Jangraw that these calculations were \"hypothetical\" and were based on an \"assumption\" that Jangraw said he did not remember and Sperry said was probably not backed by any data. Sperry stated that the add-on tax was zero for 10 of the 17 years between 1984 and 2000, and was less than one percent for five more years. So only in two years did the add-on tax exceed one percent. Jangraw testified that a conscious decision was made not to adopt the committee's recommendation by including the add-on tax, but he does not remember why. The answer may be simplification of the calculation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One simplification adopted by the company worked clearly to the advantage of the general agents. MassMutual did not reduce net rates of return for state taxes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aside from the tax charge, the evidence demonstrates that for the fixed interest rate option but not the shadow account option, MassMutual also reduced the gross rates of returns that it posted to the general agents' accounts by two other, very small charges. First, there was an administrative charge designed to offset MassMutual's costs of administration. This ran at 20 basis points, resulting in a two-tenths of one percent reduction in the net fixed interest rate. For all non-qualified benefit plans that MassMutual administered, this apparently resulted in an annual provision of about $200,000 for the approximately five people who spent the majority of their time working on these plans, which seemed \"quite reasonable\" to Jangraw in a December 1, 1993 memorandum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, there was a charge which had been called conflicting things: it was sometimes referred to as a \"profit charge\" and sometimes as a \"risk charge.\" Jangraw and another actuary (and senior vice-president) with MassMutual, Isadore Jermyn, both explained that the purpose of this charge is not to allow MassMutual to make a profit, but rather to offset the risk of rapid asset loss associated with holding additional capital; this offset was required by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. The amount of this risk or profit charge was also quite small, running at 40 basis points before 1993 and 50 basis points after 1993. Jangraw concluded in his December 1, 1993 memorandum, after performing some calculations and considering the \"risk-based capital requirements associated with these [deferred compensation] accounts,\" that the \"40-50 basis point [risk] charge does not seem unreasonably high.\" Thus the total effect of the expense and risk charges was only to subtract six- or seven-tenths of one percent from the gross rate of return.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Significantly, for the fixed interest rate option, the rate was then increased above its otherwise net value (after tax, expense, and risk charges) by a subsidy. The amount of this subsidy has varied widely, but it hovered between 254 basis points and 48 basis points between 1987 and 1999. It would have approximately at least canceled out the expense and risk charges in all but one year, 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was common for insurance companies with deferred compensation plans for general agents to impose tax charges. Some 1994 research found that the rate of return that MassMutual credited on its fixed interest rate option was about the same as the rates of return for four of the five insurance companies that offered similar plans (the other company offered a substantially higher rate of return). MassMutual employees were attuned to standard industry practice and considered it when setting their rates of return: this was one purpose for the subsidy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1999, MassMutual discontinued the tax charge due to complaints from general agents, but only for prospective contributions; for equity reasons, contributions made before 1999 would continue to be reduced by the amount of the tax charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>C. MassMutual's Efforts to Inform Agents about the Tax Charge</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no evidence that MassMutual ever tried to hide the fact that it was assessing a tax charge; there is, in fact, considerable evidence that it communicated what it was doing to the general agents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is very clear from 1993 onward. Throughout 1993 and 1994, the tax charge was a constant topic of discussion between MassMutual and the general agents at the various meetings of the general agents. In 1993, a MassMutual employee wrote a letter to all general agent participants in the deferred compensation plan, explaining the development of the credited rates of return. The letter clearly identifies the tax charge as an issue, explains its rationale, and suggests that general agents \"check with their investment/financial advisors\" to see if the plan is beneficial to them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1994, the company sent two letters, on July 15 and December 20, discussing the tax charge in question and answer format. The July 15 memorandum answered the question, \"What is the tax charge? How is it determined?,\" explained why a more complex, fund-specific type of tax charge was not used on the shadow account option, and noted that in the event of losses on a shadowed account, the effect of the tax charge would actually be to reduce the losses. The December 20, 1994 memorandum went further; it included explanations of the three issues described above and also explained precisely when participating in the plan was likely to be worthwhile for agents. In general, the memo emphasized, both through words and through a tabular illustration, that participation was likely to be a good idea whenever the rate of the tax charge was lower than the participant's own, personal marginal tax rate (including federal income, state income, and payroll taxes).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The memorandum also stressed that \"[i]n the final analysis, the decision to participate or not, should be made after fully considering all of your tax and retirement planning strategies.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence on MassMutual's communications before 1993 with its general agents is considerably sparser. One employee, Robert Massaro, testified that he began working with the compensation committee of the general agents' association in 1986; thereafter, he would refer issues dealing with the tax charge back to the company when general agents would raise them \"[f]rom time to time.\" There was some more specific evidence that the tax charge was the subject of discussion between some general agents (perhaps only retired general agents) and company employees at a conference in the late 1980s. A letter sent from MassMutual to Odom's general agency in 1989 referenced this conference and explained the tax charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a letter, McAdams stated that he became aware of the tax charge a \"few years\" after 1983. A 1990 letter from MassMutual to McAdams in March 1990 noted in passing that \"we adjust the unit values for taxes\" and this indicated to McAdams that a tax charge was applied. McAdams certainly understood the tax charge by 1991 or 1992, when he discussed the issue at length with MassMutual's CEO at a general agents' conference. Finally, the company always sent periodic balance statements to each of its participants; these statements did not include any reference to the rate or dollar value of the tax charge, however. They merely showed the total gain or loss on a participant's account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McAdams and Odom filed suit against MassMutual in U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts on December 28, 1999, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated. They alleged that MassMutual's use of the tax charge and related charges constituted a breach of contract, a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, a breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and a violation of Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 93A, section 11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MassMutual moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. Senior Judge Freedman granted this motion in part and denied it in part on December 13, 2000. <i>McAdams v. Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co.,</i> No. Civ. A.99-30284-FHF, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22068 (D.Mass. December 13, 2000). The court held that on the contract count, the \"language, at best [for MassMutual], presents an ambiguity with regard to whether the Agreement authorizes MassMutual to deduct the tax charge from funds invested in the general reserves and assets.\" <i>Id.</i> at *12. The court emphasized that the agreement expressly provides for a deduction of taxes where deferred accounts are separately invested, but the portion of the agreement dealing with situations where the deferred accounts are not separately invested but instead are placed in MassMutual's own general reserves and assets does not contain this express language. The court also noted the principle that ambiguous language is to be construed against the drafter, in this case MassMutual. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court held that plaintiffs' breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing count also had to stand, because the allegation that MassMutual breached the contract and \"capitalized on [its] position as the administrators of the [p]lan would amply justify recovery.\" <i>Id.</i> at *14. The court refused to dismiss the fiduciary duty count as well, holding that McAdams and Odom had alleged enough facts to withstand dismissal of the fiduciary claim because \"the defendants maintained the dominant voice in the management of the deferred compensation incomes.\" <i>Id.</i> at *17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did dismiss the Chapter 93A count because Chapter 93A does not apply to \"purely private transactions.\" This plan was a purely private transaction because it was never offered to the general public and only applied to a small subset of general agents. <i>Id.</i> at *20-*21. The district court also dismissed the fraud and negligent misrepresentation counts as pled without the requisite specificity of fact. <i>Id.</i> at *19-*20. The court granted leave to amend the complaint, but McAdams and Odom did not do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McAdams and Odom then moved to certify the class; certification was denied by Judge Freedman on May 15, 2002. <i>McAdams v.

On June 13, 2002, thirty-five former general agents moved for leave to join or intervene in the McAdams/Odom suit. Judge Freedman denied that motion on March 26, 2003. On April 7, 2003, thirty of these thirty-five filed individual actions in district court based on the same basic legal theories.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a period for discovery, MassMutual moved for summary judgment on all remaining claims, and District Court Judge Ponsor granted the motion in its entirety on March 26, 2004. The court focused on what it saw as the central issue, the problem of contract interpretation. It held that the language in the general reserves section of the contract authorizing MassMutual to credit \"interest ... to the account from time to time ... at a rate determined by the Company\" was unambiguously \"a broad grant [of discretion] to MassMutual.... [It] gives the defendants expansive discretion to determine the rate in <i>any</i> rational manner it sees fit.\" The express mention in the contract of deductions for taxes and expenses where money is separately invested and the absence of this express language in the section dealing with situations where the money is kept in MassMutual's general reserves did not properly lead to an application of the <i>expressio unius est exclusio alterius</i> maxim to deny MassMutual's ability to deduct taxes from these types of accounts because the \"glaring omission of <i>any</i> limitation on [MassMutual's] discretion... trump[ed] any attempt to attribute significance to a lack of an itemization of factors.\" The court concluded that \"[a]bsent demonstrable bad faith, fraud or egregiously unreasonable behavior,\" MassMutual could do whatever it wanted with the rate of return on the deferred funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court concluded that the claims for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing also failed. The court noted that it was \"questionable\" whether MassMutual was a fiduciary, but even if it was, neither fiduciary duties nor the duties imposed by the covenant of good faith and fair dealing were violated. Plaintiffs had offered only a \"difference in opinion\" as to how to calculate the rate of return; there was no showing that MassMutual's method was a result of bad faith. Moreover, the court emphasized the \"transparency\" of MassMutual's conduct, and the fact that McAdams and Odom continued to defer even after they were well aware of the tax charge. Finally, the court concluded that McAdams's own claims would be dismissed regardless because of a release he signed with MassMutual in 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 5, 2004, after having issued an order to show cause why summary judgment should not be granted, the district court granted summary judgment against the thirty general-agent plaintiffs in the related cases as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of the plaintiffs filed timely appeals, and the appeals of the thirty related plaintiffs were consolidated with the appeal of McAdams and Odom by this court.

Byard,</i> 163 F.3d 2, 6 (1st Cir.1998). Ordinarily, contracts are construed by a court \"as a matter of law\" unless there are material disputes as to extrinsic facts bearing on the correct interpretation. <i>Fenoglio v. Augat, Inc.,</i> 254 F.3d 368, 370 (1st Cir.2001) (quoting <i>Principal Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Racal-Datacom, Inc.,</i> 233 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.2000)). This is true even in \"close cases\"; the jury does not become involved when words and context alone are used, but only when extrinsic evidence is at issue. <i>See Fishman v. LaSalle Nat'l Bank,</i> 247 F.3d 300, 303 (1st Cir.2001).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Words are not viewed in isolation within a contract.

Contract interpretation under Massachusetts law depends heavily on context and recognizes that words can have different meanings in different contexts. <i>See id.; Shea v. Bay State Gas Co.,</i> 383 Mass. 218, 418 N.E.2d 597, 600 (1981). Thus, agreements should be construed \"with reference to the situation of the parties when they made it and to the objects sought to be accomplished.\" <i>Starr,</i> 648 N.E.2d at 1269 (quoting <i>Bryne v. City of Gloucester,</i> 297 Mass. 156, 8 N.E.2d 170, 171 (1937) (internal quotation marks omitted)). This sort of contextual evidence is not the kind of evidence that is intended to be barred by the parol evidence rule if no ambiguity is found; rather, context should be used as a tool to find unambiguous meaning in the first place. <i>See Robert Indus., Inc. v.

[MassMutual] alone shall determine the amount of net earnings that will be credited to the General Agent's account; and such determination of net earnings, including the determination as to charges for expenses and taxes, shall be final.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found paragraph three to be unambiguous: \"It is a broad grant to MassMutual to determine, as it sees fit, the rate of interest credited to the accounts of the general agents.\" More specifically, the court determined that the clause requiring the company to credit interest \"at a rate determined from time to time by [MassMutual]\" permitted MassMutual to deduct expenses and taxes in determining that interest. We agree with this narrower formulation. Specifically, we reject the plaintiffs' argument that in the face of an explicit contractual grant of authority to the company, the company could not deduct expenses and taxes unless the contract permitted it to do so <i>in haec verba.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs point to the term \"interest,\" ignoring the phrase that interest is to be credited \"at a rate determined from time to time by the company.\" \"Interest\" has been defined as \"[t]he compensation fixed by agreement or allowed by law for the use or detention of money ... esp., the amount owed to a lender in return for the use of borrowed money.\" <i>Black's Law Dictionary</i> 829 (8th ed.2004). The term does not preclude deduction of expenses incurred in determining the rate of return. Here the deferred compensation is invested with the common assets of the company. The making of investments itself involves costs and any sensible rate of return accounts for those costs. The fact that this is an unqualified plan means that the company has additional taxes it must pay (unlike a qualified plan). The decision to account for those taxes in setting the rate of interest is within the literal language affording the company the discretion to set the rate of interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reasonableness of this reading is reinforced by the fact that the company is explicitly granted the authority in the first paragraph to deduct from net earnings, when funds are invested separately, \"all expenses and taxes attributable to the making, carrying and liquidation of such investments.\" The clause in paragraph three gives the company even broader authority. It would be unreasonable to interpret that broader grant of authority in paragraph three as not encompassing powers explicitly authorized in the narrower grant of authority in paragraph one. In this situation, the principle of <i>expressio unius est exclusio alterius</i> has no place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in industry custom operates to render this clear reading suspect.

Under Massachusetts law, every contract implies such a covenant. <i>Anthony's Pier Four, Inc. v. HBC Assocs.,</i> 411 Mass. 451, 583 N.E.2d 806, 820 (1991). The purpose of the covenant is not to add terms to a contract; indeed, it may not do so.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court recently reinforced this understanding of the covenant. In <i>UNO Restaurants, Inc. v. Boston Kenmore Realty Corp.,</i> 441 Mass. 376, 805 N.E.2d 957 (2004), the court held that a directed verdict should enter against a claim of breach of the covenant. The court stressed that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[t]he covenant may not ... be invoked to create rights and duties not otherwise provided for in the existing contractual relationship, as the purpose of the covenant is to guarantee that the parties remain faithful to the intended and agreed expectations of the parties in their performance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 964; <i>see also Sparks v.

It does not, however, add new substantive obligations to their contractual undertakings.\") (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This contract, read in light of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, constrains MassMutual's contractual discretion somewhat. <i>See</i> 2 E. Allan Farnsworth, <i>Farnsworth on Contracts</i> &#167; 7.17, at 365 (3d ed.2004) (covenant is often used to limit discretion where the terms of the contract give one side discretion over another). There is obviously a requirement that the company act in good faith; the lack of good faith can be inferred from \"unreasonable[ness] under all the circumstances.\" <i>Nile v. Nile,</i> 432 Mass. 390, 734 N.E.2d 1153, 1160 (2000); <i>see Krapf v. Krapf,</i> 439 Mass. 97, 786 N.E.2d 318, 324-25 (2003). While, as MassMutual urges, an \"arbitrary and capricious\" use of discretion would certainly violate the covenant, the Massachusetts courts have also used the language of \"unreasonableness,\" which is the usage we employ. <i>See Nile,</i> 734 N.E.2d at 1160.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The core of the covenant is to ensure that one party does not deprive another of the \"fruits of <i>the contract.</i>\" <i>Anthony's Pier Four, Inc.,</i> 583 N.E.2d at 820 (quoting <i>Druker v. Roland Wm. Jutras Assocs., Inc.,</i> 370 Mass. 383, 348 N.E.2d 763, 765 (1976) (internal quotation marks omitted)) (emphasis added). \"The covenant is preserved so long as neither party injures the rights of another to reap the benefits <i>prescribed by the terms of the contract.</i>\" <i>UNO Rests.,</i> 805 N.E.2d at 964 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The general agents argue that such deprivation is precisely what happened here. They argue that by assessing the tax charge, MassMutual was wiping out the whole point of the deferred compensation plan, which was to allow the general agents to invest money tax free until it was actually distributed to participants. The agents believe that the company's imposition of an annual tax charge based on its corporate tax liability completely frustrated this purpose and deprived the agents of the benefits of this type of plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is misplaced because it focuses merely on the phrase \"deferred compensation plan\" and not on the contractual language of the second sentence of paragraph three. We have interpreted the contract as giving MassMutual discretion to consider taxes, expenses and other costs in setting the rate of interest. A proper exercise of this discretion cannot deprive the agents of the fruit of the contract. As <i>UNO Restaurants</i> makes clear, the covenant cannot be used to contradict clear contractual terms. The agents' first argument on the covenant claim was thus resolved in our discussion of the contract claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There remains the possibility that MassMutual might have exercised its discretion to set a rate so unreasonably as to violate the covenant. Plaintiffs make exactly that argument. McAdams and Odom argue that unreasonableness is shown by the fact that MassMutual was told that its basic methodology for calculating the tax charge was wrong and resulted in an excessive charge on several occasions; its continuing use of the methodology showed bad faith. But the evidence indisputably shows that the basic method was, after several minor simplifications, correct; the occasional criticisms of it were themselves based on errors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The general agents next stress that the refusal to reduce the tax charge due to the add-on tax and the tax treatment of unrealized gain shows MassMutual's bad faith. The evidence is undisputed that MassMutual made these two simplifications because it understood that they cut down on the company's administrative costs without having a significant impact on the tax charge rate. And not all of the simplifications ran against the general agents: the failure to consider state corporate income taxes when setting the tax charge probably aided general agents considerably.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agents also unsuccessfully argue that the expense and risk/profit charges on the fixed interest option violate the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. In theory these are, like the tax charge, reasonable attempts to allow MassMutual to break even and avoid losses from administering the deferred compensation plan. In practice, the assessment of these charges has not been unreasonable; the charges have been approximately correct after some sensible simplifications. At any rate, these two charges have been quite small and usually have been far more than offset by the subsidy added by MassMutual to fixed interest rate returns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note finally that a lack of transparency, with other evidence, may be important evidence in supporting a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Bad faith may be shown partially by the fact that a party is trying to hide what she is doing from the other party in order to disadvantage that party. For example, where a party uses discretionary rights under a contract pretextually, as cover for a hidden and illicit motive, an inference of bad faith may be warranted. <i>See Anthony's Pier Four, Inc.,</i> 583 N.E.2d at 820-21; <i>Starr v. Fordham,</i> 420 Mass. 178, 648 N.E.2d 1261, 1266 (1995) (finding breach of covenant on partnership contract where partners unfairly reduced one partner's share by fabricating a list of negative factors and by \"select[ing] performance criteria in order to justify the lowest possible payment to the plaintiff\"). Here, MassMutual was reasonably transparent about what it was doing and why. The 1993 and 1994 communications marked a substantial attempt to inform the general agents about the workings of the tax charge and about whether it would still be a good idea for the agents to participate in the plan. Even before 1993, MassMutual was not trying to hide anything; there is evidence that it tried to communicate the tax charge to the general agents on some occasions in the 1980s.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the evidence, no reasonable finder of fact could conclude in the plaintiffs' favor on the covenant claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>C. Breach of Fiduciary Duty</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Massachusetts law, the question of whether one party owes fiduciary duties to another is a question of fact. <i>Indus. Gen. Corp. v. Sequoia Pac. Sys. Corp.,</i> 44 F.3d 40, 44 (1st Cir.1995). Key factors in this fact-specific inquiry include one party's lack of sophistication relative to another on the relevant issues, and whether one party has granted another party a great deal of discretion. <i>Patsos v. First Albany Corp.,</i> 433 Mass. 323, 741 N.E.2d 841, 849-51 (2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not decide whether there is a disputed issue of fact concerning the existence of a fiduciary relationship between MassMutual and any or all of the general agents, because even if fiduciary duties existed, there was no breach. The core fiduciary obligation in this sort of context is a duty on MassMutual to exercise any discretionary power that it has in good faith, with prudence and after serious consideration, and reasonably according to the purposes of the agreement and standard fiduciary principles. <i>See Ventura v. Ventura,</i> 407 Mass. 724, 555 N.E.2d 872, 875 (1990); <i>Briggs v. Crowley,</i> 352 Mass. 194, 224 N.E.2d 417, 421-22 (1967); <i>Copp v. Worcester County Nat'l Bank,</i> 347 Mass. 548, 199 N.E.2d 200, 203 (1964). This obligation was met here: the tax charge was both created and applied in a manner that was well thought out and reasonable in light of the plan's purpose, and there was no bad faith. Sometimes, there may be a breach of a fiduciary duty if the fiduciary fails to disclose certain information. <i>Puritan Med. Ctr., Inc. v. Cashman,</i> 413 Mass. 167, 596 N.E.2d 1004, 1010 (1992). MassMutual has satisfied any such obligation by making, as already explained, considerable efforts to pass information about the tax charge on to the general agent participants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>D. Chapter 93A</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 93A, section 11 protects against unfair and deceptive trade practices. A dispute must involve a \"commercial transaction\" to fall into the reach of the statute. <i>Szalla v. Locke,</i> 421 Mass. 448, 657 N.E.2d 1267, 1270 (1995). The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has interpreted this to include only transactions that are \"offered generally by a person for sale to the public in a business transaction\" and to exclude transactions that \"are principally `private in nature,'\" such as a dispute between employer and employee. <i>Manning v. Zuckerman,</i> 388 Mass. 8, 444 N.E.2d 1262, 1265-66 (1983). MassMutual argues that the dispute at issue here is private in nature, and thus no 93A claim can lie; plaintiffs counter that such a claim is stated because they are independent contractors and not employees. Whether an independent contractor can recover for a 93A violation is unclear under Massachusetts law. <i>See Schinkel v. Maxi-Holding, Inc.,</i> 30 Mass.App.Ct. 41, 565 N.E.2d 1219, 1224-25 (1991). The issue may hinge not on the label of \"independent contractor,\" but on a fact-specific, case-by-case analysis into the type of relationship that the independent contractor has with the company at issue. <i>See Linkage Corp. v. Trs. of Boston Univ.,</i> 425 Mass. 1, 679 N.E.2d 191, 207 (1997) (corporation that worked for a university as, according to the contract, independent contractor rather than employee or agent, could maintain 93A action against university); <i>Benoit v. Landry, Lyons &amp; Whyte Co.,</i> 31 Mass.App.Ct. 948, 580 N.E.2d 1053, 1053 (1991) (real estate salesman could not use 93A even if he was an independent contractor). Because the state law is unclear, we decline to decide the 93A claim on this ground.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the transaction between MassMutual and the general agents was commercial in nature and the claim should have survived a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, MassMutual's actions in this case did not violate Chapter 93A, as amply demonstrated by the summary judgment record. Plaintiffs do not argue that there is any additional evidence pertinent to this claim that is not on this record. Conduct that is \"`in disregard of known contractual arrangements' and intended to secure benefits for the breaching party\" falls afoul of Chapter 93A. <i>Anthony's Pier Four, Inc. v. HBC Assocs.,</i> 411 Mass. 451, 583 N.E.2d 806, 821 (1991) (quoting <i>Wang Labs., Inc. v. Bus. Incentives, Inc.,</i> 398 Mass. 854, 501 N.E.2d 1163, 1167 (1986)). Here, MassMutual did not disregard the contract and behaved reasonably in its application of the contract. A 93A claim is based on unfairness or deception, not a mere \"difference of opinion\": \"a good faith dispute as to whether money is owed, or performance of some kind is due, is not the stuff of which a c. 93A claim is made.\" <i>Duclersaint v. Fed. Nat'l Mortgage Ass'n,</i> 427 Mass. 809, 696 N.E.2d 536, 540 (1998). MassMutual's actions were all fair, reasonable, in good faith, and transparent; the general agents' differences of opinions do not come close to raising a violation of Chapter 93A.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the way we have resolved the case, we need not consider the general agents' motion to certify the class, MassMutual's statute of limitations defense, or MassMutual's assertion that McAdams released his own claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's grant of summary judgment on all claims for MassMutual is <i>affirmed.</i> So ordered.

MassMutual thus simplified by assuming that all deferred money placed in the fixed interest option was held as cash (rather than bonds or something else). In reality, this money was held as part of MassMutual's general cash reserves, which apparently reflected a mix of asset types</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The tax charge on the shadow option was a bit more complex; the company followed the practice of treating this money as though it was actually invested in a shadowed fund, and so the tax charge on all shadowed accounts equaled an approximate \"weighted average\" of the federal marginal tax rates on the various types of income found in all of these funds, such as dividend income, capital gains, and bond income, as well as simple income. In treating this income as though it were actually being taxed at the same rate as the shadowed funds, MassMutual was, of course, using a fiction. This shadowed money was really held in MassMutual's general reserves, and thus its effective tax rate was dependent on the mix of assets in those general reserves. But the fiction was not unfair; it treated general agents approximately the same way they would have been treated if they had actually put their money in the fund that was being shadowed.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">At any rate, this difference in method of calculation had little impact on the ultimate rate: the rates for the fixed interest and shadow options were generally similar.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The record has one other piece of evidence which plaintiffs argue demonstrates that the tax charge was incorrectly calculated. An outside consultant hired by MassMutual during a 1992 committee review of deferred compensation plans stated, in a \"position paper,\" that \"we feel that the way the rate is currently calculated results in a rate which is too low. We do not feel that the ultimate company tax deduction was taken into account when the rate is calculated.\" This point, which is made only cursorily and without any supporting documentation in the paper, simply seems to be based on a misunderstanding of the charge, as noted by Margaret Sperry, a manager and lawyer for MassMutual, who corrected the consultant about his mistake. It is, in any event, insufficient to support the inferences needed to withstand summary judgment</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Jangraw noted in his deposition testimony that the purpose of the plan was to keep the cost to the company \"approximately\" neutral while at the same time not having too high \"an administrative burden on the plan administrators.\" There was thus some interest by MassMutual in not making the plan unreasonably complex</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The memo actually noted that the issue of whether the plan was beneficial to the general agents was a bit more complex. The discussion included \"some important qualifiers\": 1) \"changes in tax rates have a big impact on the financial advantages of [the plan],\" 2) because the plan is nonqualified, the general agents would have mere unsecured general creditor status if MassMutual were to declare bankruptcy, and 3) general agents should put as much money as possible into 401(k) plans before putting money into this plan, because 401(k)'s have more advantageous tax treatment</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The choice of law clause in the agreement states that Massachusetts state law applies to \"[a]ll questions pertaining to the construction, validity and effect of the provisions of this Agreement.\" In the briefs before this court, both sides have cited Massachusetts law for all of their claims, including the fiduciary duty and 93A claims. Because of this implicit agreement between the parties that Massachusetts law should apply to all claims, we apply it in this diversity case without inquiring further<i>Hershey v.

McAdams and Farrell D. Odom, former general agents for the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company (\"MassMutual\"), filed suit against MassMutual on behalf of themselves and all other similarly situated MassMutual general agents. The claims are Massachusetts state law claims and jurisdiction is premised on diversity. Plaintiffs participated in a non-qualified deferred compensation plan; they allege that the plan was managed by MassMutual in violation of the contract underlying the plan, the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the contract, and a fiduciary duty running from MassMutual to plan participants. They also allege violations of Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 93A, which prohibits unfair and deceptive trade practices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Specifically, McAdams and Odom allege that MassMutual unlawfully assessed a tax charge against participants' deferred compensation earnings that was designed to fully offset the tax costs to MassMutual from running the plan. Under the contract, they argue, no such charge can be assessed, and even if such a charge could be assessed, the charge assessed by MassMutual was, in reality, far too high merely to offset MassMutual's tax costs. MassMutual admits that such a tax charge was assessed but argues that the contract allowed it and that the amount of the charge was reasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After discovery, the district court dismissed all of McAdams's and Odom's claims on summary judgment and also, after denying a motion for class certification, dismissed all of the actions of thirty related plaintiffs. Because the undisputed record shows that MassMutual's actions remained well within the bounds of discretion permitted to MassMutual by the contract and by the underlying covenant of good faith and fair dealing, we now affirm the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recount all facts in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment, McAdams and Odom in this case. <i>Dwan v. City of Boston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781981\"><a href=\"/opinion/781981/robert-a-dwan-catherine-m-dwan-allyson-m-dwan-by-her-parents-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">329</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">275</span></a></span>, 277 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McAdams and Odom worked as general agents for MassMutual in Texas; they ran and owned fairly large (forty- to eighty-person) agencies that sold insurance and other products for the company. Both of their general agencies sold deferred compensation plans to their customers. These general agents were not classified as employees of MassMutual and in fact were closer to independent contractors than to employees &#8212; for example, the general agents did not receive a salary from MassMutual and did not send profit and loss statements for their general agencies to MassMutual, although MassMutual did pick up certain expenses, such as rent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>A. The Deferred Compensation Plan</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MassMutual first established a deferred compensation plan for general agents in 1967; this first plan allowed for accumulation of deferred amounts of earned income at a fixed interest rate. The plan at issue here was created in 1970. The new plan, unlike the old, provided an option, should MassMutual wish to provide it, of investing deferred compensation in stocks (a higher-risk, higher-return option) rather than investing in a fixed income account. McAdams first began deferring compensation with the plan in 1983; Odom in 1986. All of the related plaintiffs (whose claims in the putative class have been joined in this consolidated appeal) were general agents who deferred compensation under this plan. At least 117 general agents were participants in this plan at some point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The deferred compensation plan was created and advertised as a perk for the general agents. As one MassMutual employee noted in a communication with the general agents, \"There is no purely corporate reason for [this] plan. It is provided for the benefit of our General Agents solely.\" Like most deferred compensation plans, the general purposes of this one were to provide a convenient \"vehicle to save additional funds for retirement\" and, most importantly, to \"shelter current contributions from current income taxation ... and to allow assets to accumulate tax free.\" Personal income tax would only need to be paid by participants on this compensation when it was actually disbursed to the general agents (upon retirement or death); in the meantime the deferred compensation could accumulate income on the investment free and clear of the personal income tax.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the general agents are not \"employees\" as that term is used by the IRS, MassMutual could not create a \"qualified\" deferred compensation plan for the general agents but instead had to create a \"non-qualified\" plan. This had important tax consequences. Money can accumulate in qualified plans, which are considered separate entities from the employer, without any adverse tax consequences for the employer at any time, but the same is not true of non-qualified plans. The money invested in non-qualified plans is considered part of the employer's assets and thus the employer has to pay tax on the funds invested in the plan (although the employer may get a tax deduction later, when the deferred compensation is actually disbursed to the general agents).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Article V of the plan's standard contract, which was signed by MassMutual and by all the plan participants (including McAdams and Odom), provided that MassMutual could choose two different ways of dealing with compensation deferred under the plan: it could either invest such compensation separately from its general reserves and assets (say, in a trust or mutual fund) or it could commingle this compensation with its general reserves and assets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Article V explains how investment earnings would be credited to general agents' accounts under each of these two choices. The first paragraph of the Article notes that if MassMutual invests the deferred compensation separately, then</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">it shall credit to the General Agent's account from time to time whatever net earnings the assets so invested have produced. Net earnings from separate investments for purposes of this Agreement shall mean gross earnings, including but not limited to, interest, dividends, realized and unrealized appreciation or loss in the value of such investments, less all expenses and taxes attributable to the making, carrying and liquidation of such investments, including but not limited to, an appropriate accrual of taxes for unrealized appreciation in the value of the investments. [MassMutual] alone shall determine the amount of net earnings that will be credited to the General Agent's account; and such determination of net earnings, including the determination as to charges for expenses and taxes, shall be final.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the Article explicitly indicates that when MassMutual invests money deferred under the plan in separate accounts, MassMutual is allowed to deduct any expenses, including taxes, that those investments cause. The purpose here seems to be to ensure that MassMutual does not lose money by administering any separate investments under the plan: if these investments lead to any expenses or taxes, these will be paid for by the plan participants and not by the plan administrator, MassMutual.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third and last paragraph of Article V discusses the crediting of earnings to deferred compensation accounts when this compensation is not separately invested but instead is kept within the company's general reserves and assets. MassMutual will then \"credit interest on that portion ... of the account not represented by separate investments of [MassMutual] assets. Such interest shall be credited to the account from time to time, in lieu of net earnings from separate investments of [MassMutual] assets, at a rate determined from time to time by the Company.\" The interpretation of this provision lies at the heart of the current dispute between McAdams, Odom, and MassMutual.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>B. MassMutual's Administration of the Plan</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MassMutual chose to invest the deferred compensation separately for only a few years early on, from 1970 through 1975; during this period the money was invested in a separate trust administered by a bank. From 1976 onward, MassMutual ceased making separate investments of deferred money. Instead, participants were generally offered two options. First, they could \"shadow\" certain equity accounts (Oppenheimer funds, for example). In this shadow option, the rate of return on the participants' accounts for a given year would track whatever was the rate of return for the shadowed account. In other words, MassMutual would pretend the money had actually been invested in the shadowed account even though it had not been.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, participants could instead choose a fixed interest option, in which their accounts would be credited with a fixed rate of return every year. This fixed rate seems to have been designed to be equivalent with the return on long-term, money-based (low-risk) accounts (like bonds or certificates of deposit).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1983, MassMutual began imposing a tax charge on the earnings of deferred compensation that used the shadow account option. This tax charge varied from 1983 to 1993, but tended to hover around 30% (although it was much lower in a few years). From 1994 to 2001, the rate of the tax charge on this option remained constant at 34.16%. MassMutual began in 1983 taking into account tax charges on the credited earnings of deferred compensation placed in the fixed account option; a formal tax charge for this option was put in place in 1987. This formal rate was 40% for 1987, 34% for 1988 through 1993, and 35% for 1994 through 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These tax charges reduce the rate of earnings on deferred money: the tax charge is multiplied by the gross rate of earnings (either the periodic rate of return on the shadowed account or the fixed interest rate determined by MassMutual) to determine a net earnings rate that is actually credited to the general agents' accounts. Thus, a nine percent gross rate of return would be reduced to about six percent after the tax charge. If a general agent chose the shadow option and the shadowed fund were to have lost money during a given period, then the result of the tax charge would actually be to reduce the agent's loss. No tax charge is assessed against the principal; only the rate of earnings is reduced by a tax charge. The rate of the tax charge has been roughly equal to MassMutual's marginal tax rate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MassMutual has stated many times that the purpose of this tax charge is roughly to offset the tax costs to MassMutual from running the plan and to place it in a revenue-neutral position relative to where it would be if it instead paid compensation to the general agents immediately. It is true that MassMutual is later able to deduct compensation to its general agents, but only when it actually pays out this compensation. The deferred compensation plan, by forcing MassMutual to keep general agent compensation in its coffers longer than it otherwise would, burdens it with two additional tax costs: 1) it gets a deduction on the principal only a number of years down the road, rather than immediately, and 2) it is now forced to pay taxes on any earnings that are accumulated on this extra principal. The tax charge is designed to offset these tax costs to MassMutual.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The undisputed facts show that MassMutual's tax charges have, in a rough sense, correctly achieved this stated goal of tax neutrality from MassMutual's perspective. A November 13, 1986 memorandum from Douglas Jangraw, an actuary for MassMutual who was heavily involved with calculating the tax charge, states that because MassMutual ultimately gets a deduction for \"interest credited\" to participant accounts (when that money is actually paid out), \"the current tax charge is probably excessive and should either be eliminated or reduced.\" But this analysis was either a mistake or, as Jangraw explains in an affidavit and in his deposition, reflected the results of a partial analysis that considered only the tax cost due to credited interest and not the tax cost due to the principal. Several other memoranda written by Jangraw, on October 21, 1986, December 4, 1986, January 10, 1987, and December 1, 1993, all concluded and clearly demonstrated that the tax charge was appropriately calculated when both tax costs to MassMutual (the principal cost and the earnings cost) are considered.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A January 26, 1995 memorandum from Jangraw stated that the tax charge, although it did not make a general agent any worse off from a tax perspective than if she had taken her compensation immediately rather than deferring it, did \"essentially put[] the participant in a neutral position relative to where he or she would have been had they taken their compensation immediately.\" But an attachment to this memo, along with two other documents, a 1994 fact sheet sent from MassMutual to its participating general agents and the \"written version\" of a 1994 discussion between a MassMutual officer and a group of general agents, clarifies this remark considerably. The 1994 fact sheet notes that the tax-charged deferred compensation plan would not always be better for employees than taking compensation immediately; however, it would be better whenever \"[the general agent's] marginal tax rate is greater than the 34.16% tax charge.\" In other words, it would generally be better whenever the total of the general agent's marginal personal federal income tax rate, marginal personal state income tax rate, and marginal payroll tax rate were greater than the rate of the tax charge. This seems to have been a common situation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The tax charge was a rough calculation that reflected some simplification;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> it is undisputed in the record that certain things were not considered in the calculation. First, the charge did not take into account the fact that unrealized gains in equities were not taxed until those gains were realized (the stocks were actually sold). There was a reason for that. Three memoranda from Jangraw &#8212; dated March 15, 1993, January 26, 1995, and April 26, 1995 &#8212; offer several reasons why unrealized gain had not historically been factored into the calculations. First, the effect on the tax charge is \"not that significant\": the January 1995 memo stated that studies had shown that the tax charge percentage would change by only about 3%, from 34.16% to \"roughly 31%.\" This change would have only a very small impact on the net interest rate credited to the general agents' accounts. Jangraw also stressed that calculating this sort of gain would add quite a bit of administrative complexity to the calculation of the tax charge; the reduction would depend on the specific characteristics of funds and on the length of deferral for individual general agents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The tax charge has also never taken into account a certain tax that the company was sometimes subject to, the add-on tax. This is a special tax, assessed between 1984 and 2000 and paid by mutual fund companies, based on surplus equity. The liabilities established by the plan reduce the amount of the surplus and therefore theoretically might justify a lower tax charge. A 1987 internal committee (including Jangraw, Margaret Sperry, and four other MassMutual employees) concluded that the tax charge was generally correctly calculated, except for the add-on tax factor, which the committee felt should be included in the tax charge calculations. Some calculations in that report suggested that reflecting the add-on tax might result in a 1.50% increase in the net return rate of earnings that general agents received. There was testimony from Sperry and Jangraw that these calculations were \"hypothetical\" and were based on an \"assumption\" that Jangraw said he did not remember and Sperry said was probably not backed by any data. Sperry stated that the add-on tax was zero for 10 of the 17 years between 1984 and 2000, and was less than one percent for five more years. So only in two years did the add-on tax exceed one percent. Jangraw testified that a conscious decision was made not to adopt the committee's recommendation by including the add-on tax, but he does not remember why. The answer may be simplification of the calculation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One simplification adopted by the company worked clearly to the advantage of the general agents. MassMutual did not reduce net rates of return for state taxes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aside from the tax charge, the evidence demonstrates that for the fixed interest rate option but not the shadow account option, MassMutual also reduced the gross rates of returns that it posted to the general agents' accounts by two other, very small charges. First, there was an administrative charge designed to offset MassMutual's costs of administration. This ran at 20 basis points, resulting in a two-tenths of one percent reduction in the net fixed interest rate. For all non-qualified benefit plans that MassMutual administered, this apparently resulted in an annual provision of about $200,000 for the approximately five people who spent the majority of their time working on these plans, which seemed \"quite reasonable\" to Jangraw in a December 1, 1993 memorandum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, there was a charge which had been called conflicting things: it was sometimes referred to as a \"profit charge\" and sometimes as a \"risk charge.\" Jangraw and another actuary (and senior vice-president) with MassMutual, Isadore Jermyn, both explained that the purpose of this charge is not to allow MassMutual to make a profit, but rather to offset the risk of rapid asset loss associated with holding additional capital; this offset was required by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. The amount of this risk or profit charge was also quite small, running at 40 basis points before 1993 and 50 basis points after 1993. Jangraw concluded in his December 1, 1993 memorandum, after performing some calculations and considering the \"risk-based capital requirements associated with these [deferred compensation] accounts,\" that the \"40-50 basis point [risk] charge does not seem unreasonably high.\" Thus the total effect of the expense and risk charges was only to subtract six- or seven-tenths of one percent from the gross rate of return.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Significantly, for the fixed interest rate option, the rate was then increased above its otherwise net value (after tax, expense, and risk charges) by a subsidy. The amount of this subsidy has varied widely, but it hovered between 254 basis points and 48 basis points between 1987 and 1999. It would have approximately at least canceled out the expense and risk charges in all but one year, 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was common for insurance companies with deferred compensation plans for general agents to impose tax charges. Some 1994 research found that the rate of return that MassMutual credited on its fixed interest rate option was about the same as the rates of return for four of the five insurance companies that offered similar plans (the other company offered a substantially higher rate of return). MassMutual employees were attuned to standard industry practice and considered it when setting their rates of return: this was one purpose for the subsidy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1999, MassMutual discontinued the tax charge due to complaints from general agents, but only for prospective contributions; for equity reasons, contributions made before 1999 would continue to be reduced by the amount of the tax charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>C. MassMutual's Efforts to Inform Agents about the Tax Charge</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no evidence that MassMutual ever tried to hide the fact that it was assessing a tax charge; there is, in fact, considerable evidence that it communicated what it was doing to the general agents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is very clear from 1993 onward. Throughout 1993 and 1994, the tax charge was a constant topic of discussion between MassMutual and the general agents at the various meetings of the general agents. In 1993, a MassMutual employee wrote a letter to all general agent participants in the deferred compensation plan, explaining the development of the credited rates of return. The letter clearly identifies the tax charge as an issue, explains its rationale, and suggests that general agents \"check with their investment/financial advisors\" to see if the plan is beneficial to them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1994, the company sent two letters, on July 15 and December 20, discussing the tax charge in question and answer format. The July 15 memorandum answered the question, \"What is the tax charge? How is it determined?,\" explained why a more complex, fund-specific type of tax charge was not used on the shadow account option, and noted that in the event of losses on a shadowed account, the effect of the tax charge would actually be to reduce the losses. The December 20, 1994 memorandum went further; it included explanations of the three issues described above and also explained precisely when participating in the plan was likely to be worthwhile for agents. In general, the memo emphasized, both through words and through a tabular illustration, that participation was likely to be a good idea whenever the rate of the tax charge was lower than the participant's own, personal marginal tax rate (including federal income, state income, and payroll taxes).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The memorandum also stressed that \"[i]n the final analysis, the decision to participate or not, should be made after fully considering all of your tax and retirement planning strategies.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence on MassMutual's communications before 1993 with its general agents is considerably sparser. One employee, Robert Massaro, testified that he began working with the compensation committee of the general agents' association in 1986; thereafter, he would refer issues dealing with the tax charge back to the company when general agents would raise them \"[f]rom time to time.\" There was some more specific evidence that the tax charge was the subject of discussion between some general agents (perhaps only retired general agents) and company employees at a conference in the late 1980s. A letter sent from MassMutual to Odom's general agency in 1989 referenced this conference and explained the tax charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a letter, McAdams stated that he became aware of the tax charge a \"few years\" after 1983. A 1990 letter from MassMutual to McAdams in March 1990 noted in passing that \"we adjust the unit values for taxes\" and this indicated to McAdams that a tax charge was applied. McAdams certainly understood the tax charge by 1991 or 1992, when he discussed the issue at length with MassMutual's CEO at a general agents' conference. Finally, the company always sent periodic balance statements to each of its participants; these statements did not include any reference to the rate or dollar value of the tax charge, however. They merely showed the total gain or loss on a participant's account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McAdams and Odom filed suit against MassMutual in U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts on December 28, 1999, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated. They alleged that MassMutual's use of the tax charge and related charges constituted a breach of contract, a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, a breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and a violation of Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 93A, section 11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MassMutual moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. Senior Judge Freedman granted this motion in part and denied it in part on December 13, 2000. <i>McAdams v. Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co.,</i> No. Civ. A.99-30284-FHF, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. Dist. LEXIS</span> <span class=\"page\">22068</span></span> (D.Mass. December 13, 2000).

The court focused on what it saw as the central issue, the problem of contract interpretation. It held that the language in the general reserves section of the contract authorizing MassMutual to credit \"interest ... to the account from time to time ... at a rate determined by the Company\" was unambiguously \"a broad grant [of discretion] to MassMutual.... [It] gives the defendants expansive discretion to determine the rate in <i>any</i> rational manner it sees fit.\" The express mention in the contract of deductions for taxes and expenses where money is separately invested and the absence of this express language in the section dealing with situations where the money is kept in MassMutual's general reserves did not properly lead to an application of the <i>expressio unius est exclusio alterius</i> maxim to deny MassMutual's ability to deduct taxes from these types of accounts because the \"glaring omission of <i>any</i> limitation on [MassMutual's] discretion... trump[ed] any attempt to attribute significance to a lack of an itemization of factors.\" The court concluded that \"[a]bsent demonstrable bad faith, fraud or egregiously unreasonable behavior,\" MassMutual could do whatever it wanted with the rate of return on the deferred funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court concluded that the claims for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing also failed. The court noted that it was \"questionable\" whether MassMutual was a fiduciary, but even if it was, neither fiduciary duties nor the duties imposed by the covenant of good faith and fair dealing were violated. Plaintiffs had offered only a \"difference in opinion\" as to how to calculate the rate of return; there was no showing that MassMutual's method was a result of bad faith. Moreover, the court emphasized the \"transparency\" of MassMutual's conduct, and the fact that McAdams and Odom continued to defer even after they were well aware of the tax charge. Finally, the court concluded that McAdams's own claims would be dismissed regardless because of a release he signed with MassMutual in 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 5, 2004, after having issued an order to show cause why summary judgment should not be granted, the district court granted summary judgment against the thirty general-agent plaintiffs in the related cases as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of the plaintiffs filed timely appeals, and the appeals of the thirty related plaintiffs were consolidated with the appeal of McAdams and Odom by this court.

We agree with this narrower formulation. Specifically, we reject the plaintiffs' argument that in the face of an explicit contractual grant of authority to the company, the company could not deduct expenses and taxes unless the contract permitted it to do so <i>in haec verba.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs point to the term \"interest,\" ignoring the phrase that interest is to be credited \"at a rate determined from time to time by the company.\" \"Interest\" has been defined as \"[t]he compensation fixed by agreement or allowed by law for the use or detention of money ... esp., the amount owed to a lender in return for the use of borrowed money.\" <i>Black's Law Dictionary</i> 829 (8th ed.2004). The term does not preclude deduction of expenses incurred in determining the rate of return. Here the deferred compensation is invested with the common assets of the company. The making of investments itself involves costs and any sensible rate of return accounts for those costs. The fact that this is an unqualified plan means that the company has additional taxes it must pay (unlike a qualified plan). The decision to account for those taxes in setting the rate of interest is within the literal language affording the company the discretion to set the rate of interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reasonableness of this reading is reinforced by the fact that the company is explicitly granted the authority in the first paragraph to deduct from net earnings, when funds are invested separately, \"all expenses and taxes attributable to the making, carrying and liquidation of such investments.\" The clause in paragraph three gives the company even broader authority. It would be unreasonable to interpret that broader grant of authority in paragraph three as not encompassing powers explicitly authorized in the narrower grant of authority in paragraph one.

The agents' first argument on the covenant claim was thus resolved in our discussion of the contract claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There remains the possibility that MassMutual might have exercised its discretion to set a rate so unreasonably as to violate the covenant. Plaintiffs make exactly that argument. McAdams and Odom argue that unreasonableness is shown by the fact that MassMutual was told that its basic methodology for calculating the tax charge was wrong and resulted in an excessive charge on several occasions; its continuing use of the methodology showed bad faith. But the evidence indisputably shows that the basic method was, after several minor simplifications, correct; the occasional criticisms of it were themselves based on errors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The general agents next stress that the refusal to reduce the tax charge due to the add-on tax and the tax treatment of unrealized gain shows MassMutual's bad faith. The evidence is undisputed that MassMutual made these two simplifications because it understood that they cut down on the company's administrative costs without having a significant impact on the tax charge rate. And not all of the simplifications ran against the general agents: the failure to consider state corporate income taxes when setting the tax charge probably aided general agents considerably.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agents also unsuccessfully argue that the expense and risk/profit charges on the fixed interest option violate the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. In theory these are, like the tax charge, reasonable attempts to allow MassMutual to break even and avoid losses from administering the deferred compensation plan. In practice, the assessment of these charges has not been unreasonable; the charges have been approximately correct after some sensible simplifications. At any rate, these two charges have been quite small and usually have been far more than offset by the subsidy added by MassMutual to fixed interest rate returns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note finally that a lack of transparency, with other evidence, may be important evidence in supporting a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Bad faith may be shown partially by the fact that a party is trying to hide what she is doing from the other party in order to disadvantage that party. For example, where a party uses discretionary rights under a contract pretextually, as cover for a hidden and illicit motive, an inference of bad faith may be warranted. <i>See Anthony's Pier Four, Inc.,</i> 583 N.E.2d at 820-21; <i>Starr v.

Here, MassMutual was reasonably transparent about what it was doing and why. The 1993 and 1994 communications marked a substantial attempt to inform the general agents about the workings of the tax charge and about whether it would still be a good idea for the agents to participate in the plan. Even before 1993, MassMutual was not trying to hide anything; there is evidence that it tried to communicate the tax charge to the general agents on some occasions in the 1980s.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the evidence, no reasonable finder of fact could conclude in the plaintiffs' favor on the covenant claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>C.

Key factors in this fact-specific inquiry include one party's lack of sophistication relative to another on the relevant issues, and whether one party has granted another party a great deal of discretion. <i>Patsos v. First Albany Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">323</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">741</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">841</span></span>, 849-51 (2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not decide whether there is a disputed issue of fact concerning the existence of a fiduciary relationship between MassMutual and any or all of the general agents, because even if fiduciary duties existed, there was no breach. The core fiduciary obligation in this sort of context is a duty on MassMutual to exercise any discretionary power that it has in good faith, with prudence and after serious consideration, and reasonably according to the purposes of the agreement and standard fiduciary principles. <i>See Ventura v.

This obligation was met here: the tax charge was both created and applied in a manner that was well thought out and reasonable in light of the plan's purpose, and there was no bad faith. Sometimes, there may be a breach of a fiduciary duty if the fiduciary fails to disclose certain information. <i>Puritan Med. Ctr., Inc. v. Cashman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2218717\"><a href=\"/opinion/2218717/puritan-medical-center-inc-v-cashman/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2218717\"><a href=\"/opinion/2218717/puritan-medical-center-inc-v-cashman/\"><span class=\"volume\">596</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1004</span></a></span>, 1010 (1992). MassMutual has satisfied any such obligation by making, as already explained, considerable efforts to pass information about the tax charge on to the general agent participants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>D.

A dispute must involve a \"commercial transaction\" to fall into the reach of the statute. <i>Szalla v.

The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has interpreted this to include only transactions that are \"offered generally by a person for sale to the public in a business transaction\" and to exclude transactions that \"are principally `private in nature,'\" such as a dispute between employer and employee. <i>Manning v. Zuckerman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2032926\"><a href=\"/opinion/2032926/manning-v-zuckerman/\"><span class=\"volume\">388</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2032926\"><a href=\"/opinion/2032926/manning-v-zuckerman/\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1262</span></a></span>, 1265-66 (1983). MassMutual argues that the dispute at issue here is private in nature, and thus no 93A claim can lie; plaintiffs counter that such a claim is stated because they are independent contractors and not employees. Whether an independent contractor can recover for a 93A violation is unclear under Massachusetts law. <i>See Schinkel v. Maxi-Holding, Inc.,</i> 30 Mass.App.Ct. 41, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2091129\"><a href=\"/opinion/2091129/schinkel-v-maxi-holding-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">565</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1219</span></a></span>, 1224-25 (1991). The issue may hinge not on the label of \"independent contractor,\" but on a fact-specific, case-by-case analysis into the type of relationship that the independent contractor has with the company at issue. <i>See Linkage Corp. v.

Plaintiffs do not argue that there is any additional evidence pertinent to this claim that is not on this record. Conduct that is \"`in disregard of known contractual arrangements' and intended to secure benefits for the breaching party\" falls afoul of Chapter 93A. <i>Anthony's Pier Four, Inc. v.

Here, MassMutual did not disregard the contract and behaved reasonably in its application of the contract. A 93A claim is based on unfairness or deception, not a mere \"difference of opinion\": \"a good faith dispute as to whether money is owed, or performance of some kind is due, is not the stuff of which a c. 93A claim is made.\" <i>Duclersaint v.

MassMutual thus simplified by assuming that all deferred money placed in the fixed interest option was held as cash (rather than bonds or something else). In reality, this money was held as part of MassMutual's general cash reserves, which apparently reflected a mix of asset types</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The tax charge on the shadow option was a bit more complex; the company followed the practice of treating this money as though it was actually invested in a shadowed fund, and so the tax charge on all shadowed accounts equaled an approximate \"weighted average\" of the federal marginal tax rates on the various types of income found in all of these funds, such as dividend income, capital gains, and bond income, as well as simple income. In treating this income as though it were actually being taxed at the same rate as the shadowed funds, MassMutual was, of course, using a fiction. This shadowed money was really held in MassMutual's general reserves, and thus its effective tax rate was dependent on the mix of assets in those general reserves. But the fiction was not unfair; it treated general agents approximately the same way they would have been treated if they had actually put their money in the fund that was being shadowed.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">At any rate, this difference in method of calculation had little impact on the ultimate rate: the rates for the fixed interest and shadow options were generally similar.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The record has one other piece of evidence which plaintiffs argue demonstrates that the tax charge was incorrectly calculated. An outside consultant hired by MassMutual during a 1992 committee review of deferred compensation plans stated, in a \"position paper,\" that \"we feel that the way the rate is currently calculated results in a rate which is too low. We do not feel that the ultimate company tax deduction was taken into account when the rate is calculated.\" This point, which is made only cursorily and without any supporting documentation in the paper, simply seems to be based on a misunderstanding of the charge, as noted by Margaret Sperry, a manager and lawyer for MassMutual, who corrected the consultant about his mistake. It is, in any event, insufficient to support the inferences needed to withstand summary judgment</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Jangraw noted in his deposition testimony that the purpose of the plan was to keep the cost to the company \"approximately\" neutral while at the same time not having too high \"an administrative burden on the plan administrators.\" There was thus some interest by MassMutual in not making the plan unreasonably complex</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The memo actually noted that the issue of whether the plan was beneficial to the general agents was a bit more complex. The discussion included \"some important qualifiers\": 1) \"changes in tax rates have a big impact on the financial advantages of [the plan],\" 2) because the plan is nonqualified, the general agents would have mere unsecured general creditor status if MassMutual were to declare bankruptcy, and 3) general agents should put as much money as possible into 401(k) plans before putting money into this plan, because 401(k)'s have more advantageous tax treatment</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The choice of law clause in the agreement states that Massachusetts state law applies to \"[a]ll questions pertaining to the construction, validity and effect of the provisions of this Agreement.\" In the briefs before this court, both sides have cited Massachusetts law for all of their claims, including the fiduciary duty and 93A claims.
