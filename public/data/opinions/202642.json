Oronoz-\nRodríguez, Deputy Solicitor General, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          February 21, 2007\n\f             LYNCH, Circuit Judge.           Plaintiff Justino Acevedo-Luis\n\nbrought suit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, claiming a violation of\n\nhis First Amendment rights.         The case was tried before a jury, and\n\nthere was testimony that Mercedes Pagán, an official in the Puerto\n\nRico Family Department, transferred Acevedo-Luis to a new job where\n\nhe had very little to do.             Throughout, the Family Department\n\nretained plaintiff on its payroll. Based on these and other facts,\n\nthe   jury    concluded     that    Pagán      had    engaged   in       political\n\ndiscrimination against Acevedo-Luis, see Rutan v. Republican Party\n\nof Ill., 497 U.S. 62, 75 (1990), but it also concluded that\n\nAcevedo-Luis had suffered no compensatory damages.                  The jury did\n\naward punitive damages in the amount of $5,000.\n\n             Unhappy    with   this       outcome,    Acevedo-Luis       appeals,\n\ncontending that there were three different errors which led to the\n\npaucity of the jury award.            He argues that the district court1\n\nerred: (1) in failing to give a proffered jury instruction that any\n\ninjury to First Amendment rights must be deemed to be \"irreparable\n\ninjury\" for purposes of determining a compensatory damages award;\n\n(2) in instructing the jurors that they may consider the financial\n\nresources    of   the   defendant    in    fixing    the   amount   of   punitive\n\ndamages; and (3) in denying his motion for a new trial for damages\n\nunder Rule 59 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n\n\n      1\n       With the consent of the parties, the case was tried before\na magistrate judge; we shall use the term \"district court.\"\n\n                                       -2-\n\f              In an opinion and order dated February 28, 2006, the\n\ndistrict court explained its reasons for rejecting each of these\n\nclaims.      We affirm.\n\n                                          I.\n\n              A brief statement of the background facts suffices.\n\nTestimony at trial established that Acevedo-Luis was a member of\n\nthe New Progressive Party.               He started working at the Family\n\nDepartment in July 1978 as a career employee.                  He gradually worked\n\nhis way up through the ranks, ultimately assuming the position of\n\nLocal      Director    in    the   San   Sebastián,         Puerto   Rico,   office.\n\nPlaintiff had about 90 to 98 people working under him, and he\n\nsupervised the work of other local supervisors, as well as the work\n\nof service providers to the public.\n\n              Acevedo-Luis was not the only Family Department official\n\nat his level in San Sebastián.                 In fact, the Family Department\n\nmaintained     two    local    offices    there:      San    Sebastián   I   and   San\n\nSebastián II.     Plaintiff was in charge of San Sebastián II and Juan\n\nSotomayor was head of San Sebastián I.                 Sotomayor had been placed\n\nin   his    position    by    virtue     of    a    court    order   requiring     his\n\nreinstatement.\n\n              The two offices were integrated in April 2002 as a result\n\nof a departmental reorganization.                  Sotomayor became head of the\n\nintegrated San Sebastián office.                   On May 6, 2002, Acevedo-Luis\n\n\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\flearned that defendants Mercedes Pagán and Yolanda Zayas2 had\n\nordered that he be transferred to the office in Aguadilla.                 Both\n\nPagán and Zayas were members of the Popular Democratic Party.               At\n\nthe time Acevedo-Luis was transferred, there was at least one\n\nvacant director position available in a nearby area.\n\n          Before his arrival in Aguadilla, Acevedo-Luis had been\n\ninformed that he would receive new orders and be assigned new\n\nduties in the Aguadilla office.           But after he reported to his new\n\njob, he was assigned no substantive tasks, had no one to supervise,\n\nwas given no office space, and had only a few menial duties.              Other\n\nwitnesses confirmed this.        Acevedo-Luis testified that he felt\n\nhumiliated   and   useless,    but   he    offered   no   medical   or   expert\n\ntestimony as to his emotional distress.              He also did not offer\n\nevidence of any economic damages.\n\n          On October 14, 2005, after spending approximately three\n\nand one-half years at the Aguadilla office, plaintiff was relocated\n\nto an office in Aguada.       There he apparently performed real work.\n\nHe testified that, during the time he was assigned to Aguadilla, he\n\n\n     2\n       By the time this case went to trial, both Pagán and Zayas\nwere defendants only in their personal capacities, as the district\ncourt had dismissed the case against them in their official\ncapacities on the grounds of Eleventh Amendment immunity.\nAdditionally, before submitting the case to the jury, the court\ngranted defendant Zayas's Rule 50 motion for judgment as a matter\nof law, with the result that the personal capacity case against her\nwas dismissed as well. On appeal, Acevedo-Luis does not challenge\nany of these dismissals. His appeal is concerned only with his\nclaim against defendant Pagán in her personal capacity. That was\nthe sole claim submitted to the jury.\n\n                                     -4-\n\fhad    been   doing      nothing   because      he   was    a   member    of    the    New\n\nProgressive Party.\n\n              We turn to his appeal.\n\n                                          II.\n\nA.            The Jury Instructions on First Amendment Damages\n\n              Acevedo-Luis requested a jury instruction stating that\n\nany violation of his First Amendment rights constituted irreparable\n\ninjury.       He believed this would have aided the jurors in their\n\ncalculation        of    compensatory    damages.          To   support   his     claim,\n\nAcevedo-Luis cited language in Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347 (1976),\n\nstating that \"[t]he loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even\n\nminimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable\n\ninjury.\"      Id. at 373.\n\n              The district court rejected the instruction.                     It noted\n\nthat    while      the     language     accurately     described         one     of    the\n\nrequirements for a preliminary injunction in a First Amendment\n\ncase, see id., it would not be helpful to a jury in determining the\n\ncompensatory damages for a First Amendment violation.\n\n              In    essence,    Acevedo-Luis's        argument     is     that    he    is\n\nentitled to an instruction that compensatory damages must be\n\nawarded whenever a jury finds a First Amendment violation. But the\n\nlaw is exactly the opposite.               It is usually the case that \"no\n\ncompensatory damages may be awarded in a § 1983 suit absent proof\n\nof actual injury.\"          Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103, 112 (1992); see\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\falso Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247, 264 (1978).           The Supreme Court\n\nhas held that in § 1983 actions, such as this, \"damages based on\n\nthe abstract 'value' or 'importance' of constitutional rights are\n\nnot a permissible element of compensatory damages.\"           Memphis Cmty.\n\nSch. Dist. v. Stachura, 477 U.S. 299, 310 (1986).                     We have\n\nsimilarly    rejected    any   argument     that   the   importance   of   the\n\ninterests at stake requires that there be an award of damages.             See\n\nAzimi v. Jordan's Meats, Inc., 456 F.3d 228, 234 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n            To the extent plaintiff is making an argument that he is\n\nentitled to at least nominal damages, he did not request a nominal\n\ndamages instruction from the district court and did not raise the\n\nissue    until   after   the   jury   was   discharged.     Plaintiff      thus\n\nforfeited,3 and most likely waived, any claim for nominal damages.\n\nSee id. at 240; see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 51(c).\n\n            The district court was also correct in concluding that\n\nthe elements of compensatory damages, including emotional distress\n\ndamages, were adequately covered by other instructions on the\n\nmanner in which damages were to be considered and determined.               As\n\n\n\n     3\n       The failure to issue a nominal damages instruction was not\nplainly erroneous. See Azimi, 456 F.3d at 239 (explaining that,\nthus far, this circuit has only required nominal damages for\nprocedural due process claims). Moreover, in this case a nominal\ndamages award does not affect rights important enough to require\nreversal under plain error review. See Alexander v. Riga, 208 F.3d\n419, 429 (3d Cir. 2000) (holding that a court's failure to rectify\nan error on nominal damages would not result in a \"miscarriage of\njustice\" because only one dollar was at stake); cf. Barnett v.\nLuther, 2 F. Cas. 879, 880 (C.C.D. Mass. 1853) (No. 1,025).\n\n                                      -6-\n\fto pain and suffering, the court instructed the jury that no\n\nevidence of monetary value of such intangible things needed to be\n\nintroduced into evidence.      The plaintiff's proffered instruction\n\nabout irreparable injury could have caused confusion or misled the\n\njury, and the court properly declined to give it.           See White v.\n\nN.H. Dep't of Corrs., 221 F.3d 254, 263 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\nB.         The Jury Instructions on Punitive Damages\n\n           The court also committed no error in instructing the\n\njurors that they could consider Pagán's financial resources, in her\n\npersonal capacity, in fixing the amount of punitive damages.          The\n\nplaintiff's   argument   is   that   this   instruction   was   misleading\n\nbecause it was possible that Puerto Rico would indemnify the\n\ndefendant under a statute commonly referred to as \"Law 9.\"            See\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 32, §§ 3085-3092.\n\n           It was entirely proper to instruct the jury that it could\n\nconsider the defendant's financial worth in assessing punitive\n\ndamages.   See City of Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., 453 U.S. 247,\n\n269 (1981); see also 4 L. Sand et al., Modern Federal Jury\n\nInstructions, Instruction 77-5 & n.21 (collecting cases).\n\n           Additionally,      here    the   court   correctly    rejected\n\nplaintiff's argument on the ground that indemnity under Law 9 is\n\nneither required nor always available. Indeed, the Commonwealth is\n\nnot required to pay indemnity when there is a punitive damages\n\naward or judgment.   See Ortiz-Feliciano v. Toledo-Davila, 175 F.3d\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f37, 39 (1st Cir. 1999); id. at 40 n.1 (discussing the narrow\n\ncircumstances, inapplicable here, in which Law 9 says it requires\n\nindemnification); Ortiz Feliciano v. Estado Libre Asociado de P.R.,\n\n158 P.R. Dec. 62, 72 (P.R. 2002) (per curiam) (stating that Law 9\n\ngives the Secretary of Justice discretion to indemnify officials);\n\nsee    also      P.R.    Laws   Ann.   tit.     32,    §   3085   (stating    that   a\n\nCommonwealth employee \"may request the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\n\n. . . to subsequently assume the payment of any judgment that may\n\nbe entered against his person\" (emphasis added)); id. § 3087\n\n(stating that the Secretary of Justice \"shall determine whether it\n\nis    in   order    to    pay   the    full   judgment      imposed\").       Further,\n\nindemnification is not allowed at all where there is inexcusable\n\nnegligence or certain other conditions.                Ortiz-Feliciano, 175 F.3d\n\nat 40 n.1; see also P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 32, § 3088.\n\nC.            The Motion for a New Trial\n\n              This leaves the contention that the district court erred\n\nin denying a new trial on damages.              We review the district court's\n\nruling on the new trial motion only for clear abuse of discretion.\n\nAzimi, 456 F.3d at 235; Ahern v. Scholz, 85 F.3d 774, 780 (1st Cir.\n\n1996).     The district court may grant such a motion only if \"the\n\nverdict is against the clear weight of the evidence, such that\n\nletting     it    stand    would   result     in   a   miscarriage    of   justice.\"\n\nValentín-Almeyda v. Municipality of Aguadilla, 447 F.3d 85, 104\n\n(1st Cir. 2006).\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\f           The district court's refusal to grant a new trial was\n\nentirely understandable.      Plaintiff suffered no out-of-pocket-loss\n\nduring his three and one-half years of exile into a make-work job.\n\nFurther, as to mental and emotional distress, non-economic damages\n\nmust be proven, and the proof of such damages is distinct from the\n\nproof required to show discrimination. See Azimi, 456 F.3d at 235.\n\nThe only testimony plaintiff offered regarding emotional distress\n\ndamages was his own testimony about feeling useless and humiliated.\n\nThe jury was not required to accept his uncorroborated testimony.\n\nId. at 235-37.4\n\n           Acevedo-Luis points out that no evidence was offered as\n\nto   Pagán's   ability   to   pay.    Nonetheless,   in   this   case   the\n\nconservative damages award of $5,000 against a public official was\n\nreasonable.\n\n           The judgment is affirmed.        No costs are awarded on\n\nappeal.\n\n\n\n\n      4\n       Acevedo-Luis does not argue that the jury verdict was\ninconsistent insofar as it awarded punitive damages while\nsimultaneously awarding zero compensatory damages.\n\n                                     -9-\n\f",

Based on these and other facts, the jury concluded that Pag&#225;n had engaged in political discrimination against Acevedo-Luis, <i>see Rutan v.

He believed this would have aided the jurors in their calculation of compensatory damages. To support his claim, Acevedo-Luis cited language in <i>Elrod v. Burns,</i> 427 U.S. 347, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976), stating that \"[t]he loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.\" <i>Id.</i> at 373, 96 S.Ct. 2673.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected the instruction.

But the law is exactly the opposite. It is usually the case that \"no compensatory damages may be awarded in a &#167; 1983 suit absent proof of actual injury.\" <i>Farrar v. Hobby,</i> 506 U.S. 103, 112, 113 S.Ct. 566, 121 L.Ed.2d 494 (1992); <i>see also Carey v. Piphus,</i> 435 U.S. 247, 264, 98 S.Ct. 1042, 55 L.Ed.2d 252 (1978).

Sch. Dist. v. Stachura,</i> 477 U.S. 299, 310, 106 S.Ct. 2537, 91 L.Ed.2d 249 (1986). We have similarly rejected any argument that the importance of the interests at stake requires that there be an award of damages. <i>See Azimi v. Jordan's Meats, Inc.,</i> 456 F.3d 228, 234 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent plaintiff is making an argument that he is entitled to at least nominal damages, he did not request a nominal damages instruction from the district court and did not raise the issue until after the jury was discharged. Plaintiff thus forfeited,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and most likely waived, any claim for nominal damages. <i>See id.</i> at 240; <i>see also</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 51(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court was also correct in concluding that the elements of compensatory damages, including emotional distress damages, were adequately covered by other instructions on the manner in which damages were to be considered and determined. As to pain and suffering, the court instructed the jury that no evidence of monetary value of such intangible things needed to be introduced into evidence. The plaintiff's proffered instruction about irreparable injury could have caused confusion or misled the jury, and the court properly declined to give it. <i>See White v. N.H. Dep't of Corrs.,</i> 221 F.3d 254, 263 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The Jury Instructions on Punitive Damages</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also committed no error in instructing the jurors that they could consider Pag&#225;n's financial resources, in her personal capacity, in fixing the amount of punitive damages. The plaintiff's argument is that this instruction was misleading because it was possible that Puerto Rico would indemnify the defendant under a statute commonly referred to as \"Law 9.\" <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 32, &#167;&#167; 3085-3092.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was entirely proper to instruct the jury that it could consider the defendant's financial worth in assessing punitive damages. <i>See City of Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc.,</i> 453 U.S. 247, 269, 101 S.Ct. 2748, 69 L.Ed.2d 616 (1981); <i>see also</i> 4 L.

Indeed, the Commonwealth is not required to pay indemnity when there is a punitive damages award or judgment. <i>See Ortiz-Feliciano v. Toledo-Davila,</i> 175 F.3d 37, 39 (1st Cir.1999); <i>id.</i> at 40 n. 1 (discussing the narrow circumstances, inapplicable here, in which Law 9 says it requires indemnification); <i>Ortiz Feliciano v.

Further, indemnification is not allowed at all where there is inexcusable negligence or certain other conditions. <i>Ortiz-Feliciano,</i> 175 F.3d at 40 n. 1; <i>see also</i> P.R.

We review the district court's ruling on the new trial motion only for clear abuse of discretion. <i>Azimi,</i> 456 F.3d at 235; <i>Ahern v. Scholz,</i> 85 F.3d 774, 780 (1st Cir.1996). The district court may grant such a motion only if \"the verdict is against the clear weight of the evidence, such that letting it stand would result in a miscarriage of justice.\" <i>Valent&#237;n-Almeyda v. Municipality of Aguadilla,</i> 447 F.3d 85, 104 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's refusal to grant a new trial was entirely understandable. Plaintiff suffered no out-of-pocket-loss during his three and one-half years of exile into a make-work job. Further, as to mental and emotional distress, non-economic damages must be proven, and the proof of such damages is distinct from the proof required to show discrimination. <i>See Azimi,</i> 456 F.3d at 235. The only testimony plaintiff offered regarding emotional distress damages was his own testimony about feeling useless and humiliated. The jury was not required to accept his uncorroborated testimony. <i>Id.</i> at 235-37.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Acevedo-Luis points out that no evidence was offered as to Pag&#225;n's ability to pay.

The case was tried before a jury, and there was testimony that Mercedes Pag&#225;n, an official in the Puerto Rico Family Department, transferred Acevedo-Luis to a new job where he had very little to do. Throughout, the Family Department retained plaintiff on its payroll. Based on these and other facts, the jury concluded that Pag&#225;n had engaged in political discrimination against Acevedo-Luis, <i>see Rutan v. Republican Party of Ill.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112472\"><a href=\"/opinion/112472/rutan-v-republican-party-of-ill/\"><span class=\"volume\">497</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></a></span>, 75, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112472\"><a href=\"/opinion/112472/rutan-v-republican-party-of-ill/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

He argues that the district court<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> erred: (1) in failing to give a proffered jury instruction that any injury to First Amendment rights must be deemed to be \"irreparable injury\" for purposes of determining a compensatory damages award; (2) in instructing the jurors that they may consider the financial resources of the defendant in fixing the amount of punitive damages; and (3) in denying his motion for a new trial for damages under Rule 59 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an opinion and order dated February 28, 2006, the district court explained its reasons for rejecting each of these claims.

Testimony at trial established that Acevedo-Luis was a member of the New Progressive Party. He started working at the Family Department in July 1978 as a career employee. He gradually worked his way up through the ranks, ultimately assuming the position of Local Director in the San Sebasti&#225;n, Puerto Rico, office. Plaintiff had about 90 to 98 people working under him, and he supervised the work of other local supervisors, as well as the work of service providers to the public.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Acevedo-Luis was not the only Family Department official at his level in San Sebasti&#225;n. In fact, the Family Department maintained two local offices there: San Sebasti&#225;n I and San Sebasti&#225;n II. Plaintiff was in charge of San Sebasti&#225;n II and Juan Sotomayor was head of San Sebasti&#225;n I. Sotomayor had been placed in his position by virtue of a court order requiring his reinstatement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two offices were integrated in April 2002 as a result of a departmental reorganization. Sotomayor became head of the integrated San Sebasti&#225;n office. On May 6, 2002, Acevedo-Luis learned that defendants Mercedes Pag&#225;n and Yolanda Zayas<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> had ordered that he be transferred to the office in Aguadilla. Both Pag&#225;n and Zayas were members of the Popular Democratic Party. At the time Acevedo-Luis was transferred, there was at least one vacant director position available in a nearby area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before his arrival in Aguadilla, Acevedo-Luis had been informed that he would receive new orders and be assigned new duties in the Aguadilla office. But after he reported to his new job, he was assigned no substantive tasks, had no one to supervise, was given no office space, and had only a few menial duties. Other witnesses confirmed this. Acevedo-Luis testified that he felt humiliated and useless, but he offered no medical or expert testimony as to his emotional distress. He also did not offer evidence of any economic damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 14, 2005, after spending approximately three and one-half years at the Aguadilla office, plaintiff was relocated to an office in Aguada.

Dep't of Corrs.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199025\"><a href=\"/opinion/199025/white-v-new-hampshire-depart/\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">254</span></a></span>, 263 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The Jury Instructions on Punitive Damages</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also committed no error in instructing the jurors that they could consider Pag&#225;n's financial resources, in her personal capacity, in fixing the amount of punitive damages. The plaintiff's argument is that this instruction was misleading because it was possible that Puerto Rico would indemnify the defendant under a statute commonly referred to as \"Law 9.\" <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 32, &#167;&#167; 3085-3092.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was entirely proper to instruct the jury that it could consider the defendant's financial worth in assessing punitive damages. <i>See City of Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110553\"><a href=\"/opinion/110553/newport-v-fact-concerts-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">453</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">247</span></a></span>, 269, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110553\"><a href=\"/opinion/110553/newport-v-fact-concerts-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Indeed, the Commonwealth is not required to pay indemnity when there is a punitive damages award or judgment. <i>See Ortiz-Feliciano v. Toledo-Davila,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198433\"><a href=\"/opinion/198433/ortiz-feliciano-v-toledo-davila/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, 39 (1st Cir.1999); <i>id.</i> at 40 n. 1 (discussing the narrow circumstances, inapplicable here, in which Law 9 says it requires indemnification); <i>Ortiz Feliciano v. Estado Libre Asociado de P.R.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Dec.</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></span>, 72 (P.R.2002) (per curiam) (stating that Law 9 gives the Secretary of Justice discretion to indemnify officials); <i>see also</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 32, &#167; 3085 (stating that a Commonwealth employee \"<i>may request</i> the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico . . . to subsequently assume the payment of any judgment that may be entered against his person\" (emphasis added)); <i>id.</i> &#167; 3087 (stating that the Secretary of Justice \"shall determine whether it is in order to pay the full judgment imposed\"). Further, indemnification is not allowed at all where there is inexcusable negligence or certain other conditions. <i>Ortiz-Feliciano,</i> 175 F.3d at 40 n. 1; <i>see also</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 32, &#167; 3088.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>The Motion for a New Trial</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves the contention that the district court erred in denying a new trial on damages. We review the district court's ruling on the new trial motion only for clear abuse of discretion. <i>Azimi,</i> 456 F.3d at 235; <i>Ahern v. Scholz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196795\"><a href=\"/opinion/196795/ahern-v-scholz/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">774</span></a></span>, 780 (1st Cir.1996). The district court may grant such a motion only if \"the verdict is against the clear weight of the evidence, such that letting it stand would result in a miscarriage of justice.\" <i>Valent&#237;n-Almeyda v. Municipality of Aguadilla,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202202\"><a href=\"/opinion/202202/valentin-v-mun-of-aquadilla/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></a></span>, 104 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's refusal to grant a new trial was entirely understandable. Plaintiff suffered no out-of-pocket-loss during his three and one-half years of exile into a make-work job. Further, as to mental and emotional distress, non-economic damages must be proven, and the proof of such damages is distinct from the proof required to show discrimination. <i>See Azimi,</i> 456 F.3d at 235. The only testimony plaintiff offered regarding emotional distress damages was his own testimony about feeling useless and humiliated. The jury was not required to accept his uncorroborated testimony. <i>Id.</i> at 235-37.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Acevedo-Luis points out that no evidence was offered as to Pag&#225;n's ability to pay.

Additionally, before submitting the case to the jury, the court granted defendant Zayas's Rule 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law, with the result that the personal capacity case against her was dismissed as well. On appeal, Acevedo-Luis does not challenge any of these dismissals. His appeal is concerned only with his claim against defendant Pag&#225;n in her personal capacity.
