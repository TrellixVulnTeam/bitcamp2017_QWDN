Robert E. Keeton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                     Selya, Circuit Judge,\n               Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                  and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n\n     Darryl Whiting on brief pro se.\n     Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, and Dickens\nMathieu, Assistant U.S. Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\f                               June 21, 2002\n\n\n                Per Curiam.       After being denied leave by             this\n\n court,    in    No.   00-1249,    to    file   a   second     or   successive\n\n petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2255, petitioner Darryl Whiting\n\n proceeded to submit just such a petition in district court.\n\n Much as he had done in this court, Whiting there disputed\n\n the applicability of AEDPA to his case.              Understandably, the\n\n lower court summarily dismissed that action in light of our\n\n March 23, 2000 ruling, and this appeal ensued.                     Whiting has\n\n provided       nothing   to   call      our    earlier    rationale      into\n\n question.         Accordingly,     the       judgment    of   dismissal    is\n\n summarily affirmed.1\n\n                Whiting also sought to amend his petition below to\n\n  advance a claim that the government had suborned perjury at\n\n  trial.   The district court properly concluded that leave of\n\n  this court was needed to pursue the matter.                       Construing\n\n\n    1\n         We pause simply to note that Whiting's two new\nassertions--that a conviction for aiding and abetting a drug\noffense cannot constitute a CCE predicate, and that a jury must\nunanimously agree upon the applicable prong of the aiding and\nabetting statute--are both in error. See, e.g., United States\nv. Escobar-De Jesus, 187 F.3d 148, 157 n.1, 160 n.6 (1st Cir.\n1999) (as to the former), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1176 (2000);\nUnited States v. Rivera-Martinez, 931 F.2d 148, 153-54 (1st Cir.\n1991) (same); United States v. Kim, 196 F.3d 1079, 1082-83 (9th\nCir. 1999) (as to the latter).\n\n                                        -2-\n\fWhiting's notice of appeal as an application therefor, we\n\ndeny such leave.   In a March 20, 2000 ruling, we rejected a\n\nsimilar request made by four of Whiting's codefendants.   See\n\nCarmichael v. United States, No. 99-1897 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\nThe new evidence on which Whiting relies, even if deemed\n\ntimely proffered, is too generalized to warrant a different\n\noutcome.   The suggestion that he need not demonstrate how\n\nthe alleged perjury might have affected the outcome of his\n\ntrial is misplaced.   See, e.g., Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S.\n\n419, 433 n.7 (1995); United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97,\n\n103 (1976).\n\n           The judgment is affirmed.   Leave to file a second\n\nor successive petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                             -3-\n\f",
