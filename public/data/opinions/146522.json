Henwood, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Rosa Emilia Rodríguez-Velez, United States Attorney, Nelson\nPérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, Chief, Appellate\nDivision, and Luke Cass, Assistant United States Attorney, were on\nbrief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                              May 14, 2010\n\f            LYNCH, Chief Judge.   The four appealing defendants were\n\nconvicted for their roles in a conspiracy to distribute cocaine,\n\ncrack cocaine, and marijuana in Barriada San Miguel, known as El\n\nCerro, in Naranjito, Puerto Rico, from 2005 to 2007.      Three were\n\nconvicted after a jury trial, Marcos Rivera-Perez, Juan Carlos\n\nTorres-Rodriguez, and Emanuel Rivera Maldonado; and one by a guilty\n\nplea, Luis Rosado-Pérez.    Rivera Maldonado was a corrupt municipal\n\npolice officer who aided the conspiracy.\n\n            Rivera-Perez, Torres-Rodriguez, and Rivera Maldonado each\n\nchallenge the sufficiency of the evidence for their convictions.\n\nRivera-Perez and Torres-Rodriguez also argue that the government\n\nimproperly presented an overview witness. We affirm. The evidence\n\nsufficed, and a government agent witness did not give improper\n\noverview testimony.      He appropriately testified from personal\n\nknowledge and explained drug activity and coded language to the\n\njury, based on his experience.\n\n            Rosado-Pérez argues, for the first time on appeal, that\n\nhe did not understand the terms of his plea and that the district\n\ncourt did not ascertain that a sufficient factual basis supported\n\nhis plea.    On plain error review, we affirm, finding no error at\n\nall.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\f                      I.   FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n          The structure of the conspiracy and the appellants' roles\n\nin it are described below as a rational jury could have found;\n\nfurther facts relevant to the claims on appeal follow.\n\n          Between 2005 and 2007 Manuel Chevres-Motta, not a party\n\nto these appeals, led an organization that distributed cocaine,\n\ncrack cocaine, heroin, and marijuana in the El Cerro ward of\n\nNaranjito.   Each of the appellants worked for Chevres-Motta, in\n\nvarious roles.\n\n          Chevres-Motta's drug organization sold only to known or\n\nvouched-for clients, usually from El Cerro.     El Cerro's geography,\n\nwhich sets it apart from the rest of Naranjito, also limited the\n\nscope of this organization's drug trade.      El Cerro rests atop a\n\nhill, and only one road, which cuts through El Cerro, connects it\n\nto Naranjito.\n\n          El Cerro \"runners\" supplied street dealers with drugs and\n\nensured the dealers gave correct money to Chevres-Motta. \"Sellers\"\n\nthen sold those drugs at regular drug points in El Cerro, including\n\na basketball court and a nearby stairwell.         Sellers sold small\n\npackets of drugs out of black fanny packs, a characteristic of the\n\nEl Cerro organization.     \"Escorts,\" usually local drug users,\n\nbrought clients to drug points and vouched for them.\n\n          Luis   Rosado-Pérez   supervised   the   cocaine    trade   for\n\nChevres-Motta.   Marcos Rivera-Perez was a seller.           Juan Carlos\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fTorres-Rodriguez \"cooked\" cocaine hydrochloride into crack cocaine.\n\nAnd   Rivera   Maldonado,     a   Naranjito       municipal     police     officer,\n\nprovided information to the group.\n\n           The    conspiracy      first    came   to    the    attention    of   law\n\nenforcement      during   a     separate       drug    and     money    laundering\n\ninvestigation.      A confidential informant in that case set up a\n\nmeeting to sell drugs; Rolando Motta-Morales, a member of the\n\nconspiracy in this case, came to that drug meeting.               For two months\n\nin 2006, federal officials wiretapped Motta-Morales's phone and\n\nlearned that Motta-Morales cooked crack cocaine for his cousin,\n\nChevres-Motta.     They also learned that Torres-Rodriguez was Motta-\n\nMorales's neighbor and cooked crack with Motta-Morales, and that\n\nRivera Maldonado was Motta-Morales's cousin and brother-in-law, as\n\nwell as a corrupt officer.\n\n           Federal     officers         investigated     the    El     Cerro     drug\n\norganization     for   almost     two    years.        Investigators     conducted\n\npersonal and video surveillance, wiretapped phones, completed about\n\nthirteen controlled drug buys through an undercover police officer\n\nbuyer, and used a confidential informant from El Cerro.\n\n           On September 26, 2007, a federal grand jury handed up a\n\ntwenty-eight-count indictment against thirty individuals, including\n\nthe four on appeal in this case, for their participation in the\n\nconspiracy.    The defendants in this case were charged in count one\n\nwith conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute controlled\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fsubstances,      21    U.S.C.    §   846,    and    in    count   twenty-eight    with\n\ncriminal forfeiture, id. §§ 853, 881.1\n\n               On May 2, 2008, a jury convicted Rivera-Perez, the\n\nseller, Torres-Rodriguez, the crack cooker, and Rivera Maldonado,\n\nthe corrupt officer, on the conspiracy count, count one.                      The jury\n\nalso       imposed    criminal   forfeiture        on    Rivera-Perez   and   Torres-\n\nRodriguez.           On August 11, 2008, the district court sentenced\n\nRivera-Perez and Torres-Rodriguez to 120 months in prison and\n\nRivera Maldonado to 48 months in prison.                    It also sentenced all\n\nthree defendants to five years' supervised release and a $100\n\nspecial assessment.\n\n               Earlier,    on    March   14,      2008,   Luis    Rosado-Pérez,    the\n\nsupervisor of the cocaine trade, had pled guilty to the conspiracy\n\nand forfeiture counts, specifically to conspiring to distribute\n\nbetween 1.5 and 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine.                      That quantity,\n\ncombined with Rosado-Pérez's criminal history category, gave him a\n\nbase offense level of 33 after a three-level downward departure for\n\nacceptance of responsibility. Rosado-Pérez's sentencing guidelines\n\nrange was 135 to 168 months.                      The government, per the plea\n\nagreement, recommended a sentence of 135 months in prison, which\n\nthe court accepted and imposed.\n\n\n\n       1\n          Marcos Rivera-Perez was also charged in count twenty-\nseven with dealing in firearms without a license, 18 U.S.C.\n§ 922(a)(1)(A). That charge was not submitted to the jury and was\ndismissed at sentencing.\n\n                                            -5-\n\fII.    CLAIMS OF MARCOS RIVERA-PEREZ, JUAN CARLOS TORRES-RODRIGUEZ,\n        AND EMANUEL RIVERA MALDONADO AS TO THEIR CONVICTIONS\n\n            Three defendants argue that the evidence of intent and\n\nagreement to participate in the conspiracy was insufficient for a\n\nconviction.       Rivera-Perez and Torres-Rodriguez also argue that the\n\ncourt    erred    in    admitting        the    testimony     of   Federal     Bureau    of\n\nInvestigation Special Agent Regino Chavez, alleging Chavez gave\n\nimproper \"overview\" testimony.                 We reject both claims.\n\nA.          Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n            We     review      the       sufficiency    of    the     evidence    for    a\n\nconviction de novo.          United States v. Azubike, 564 F.3d 59, 64 (1st\n\nCir.    2009).         We   take     the   evidence     and    draw    all     reasonable\n\ninferences in the light most favorable to the prosecution.                        Id.    If\n\na    reasonable    jury      could    find      the   defendants      guilty    beyond    a\n\nreasonable doubt of all elements of the charged offense, we must\n\naffirm the conviction.             Id.\n\n            On count one, the prosecution had to prove, through\n\ndirect or circumstantial evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt that\n\n\"each defendant knowingly and voluntarily agreed with others\" to\n\ndistribute drugs.           United States v. Rivera Calderón, 578 F.3d 78,\n\n88 (1st Cir. 2009).          Evidence of a knowing agreement could include\n\nevidence that the defendants took actions that furthered the\n\nconspiracy's goals.           United States v. García-Pastrana, 584 F.3d\n\n351, 377 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n\n\n                                               -6-\n\f          1.     Marcos Rivera-Perez\n\n          Marcos Rivera-Perez admits on appeal, as he conceded\n\nwhile testifying at trial, that he sold drugs in El Cerro, but he\n\nsays the evidence did not show he sold drugs for the Chevres-Motta\n\nconspiracy.\n\n          Sufficient   evidence    connected   Rivera-Perez   to   the\n\nChevres-Motta conspiracy. Both a lead investigator in the case and\n\na confidential informant identified him and testified that he sold\n\ndrugs in El Cerro.     Videos showed him selling drugs from black\n\nfanny packs, as the conspiracy's other sellers did.     Rivera-Perez\n\nwas shown selling drugs from the stairwell near the basketball\n\ncourt, a regular drug point for this conspiracy.       Videos showed\n\nRivera-Perez selling to, interacting with, and standing nearby\n\nknown conspiracy members and clients.\n\n          A jury could easily reject the idea that Chevres-Motta\n\nand his coconspirators would permit a competing drug dealer to sell\n\nin the heart of their small, isolated neighborhood at one of their\n\nusual drug points.   A reasonable juror instead could conclude that\n\nRivera-Perez sold drugs for this conspiracy and therefore agreed\n\nand intended to further its aims.\n\n          2.     Juan Carlos Torres-Rodriguez\n\n          Torres-Rodriguez, the crack cooker, who lived twenty\n\nminutes from El Cerro, also argues that the evidence showed at most\n\n\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fhe cooked crack with his neighbor, Motta-Morales, but not for the\n\nrest of the El Cerro conspiracy led by Chevres-Motta.\n\n               The evidence was sufficient.       In several phone calls,\n\nplayed    at    trial,   Torres-Rodriguez   and   Motta-Morales   discussed\n\ncooking    crack    together.     The   evidence   supported   the   jury's\n\nconclusion that they were collaborating to cook crack for Chevres-\n\nMotta's El Cerro organization for two reasons.\n\n               First, the jury heard many phone calls in which Motta-\n\nMorales discussed his work as a cooker with a number of conspiracy\n\nmembers over a period of months.            In particular, Motta-Morales\n\ndiscussed his work with the conspiracy leader, Chevres-Motta, who\n\nwas Motta-Morales's cousin.          He reported his progress cooking\n\ncrack, discussed how to buy more cocaine to cook, and planned how\n\nto deliver drugs to Chevres-Motta and receive payment.\n\n               Second, many calls played before the jury between Torres-\n\nRodriguez and Motta-Morales supported the inference that they were\n\nworking for Chevres-Motta, since they referenced Chevres-Motta\n\nseveral times by his street name.             Motta-Morales reported to\n\nTorres-Rodriguez Chevres-Motta's instructions and comments about\n\ntheir work cooking crack, and he did so once shortly after he had\n\nended a call with Chevres-Motta.\n\n               3.     Emanuel Rivera Maldonado\n\n               Rivera Maldonado, the former Naranjito municipal police\n\nofficer, urges that the evidence did not show that he intended to\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fhelp a drug conspiracy or even that he knew he had spoken with a\n\nconspiracy member; he says he was simply helping family.                           He did,\n\nfrom   his    position       as    a    police       officer,    provide    help    to   the\n\nconspiracy, and a reasonable jury could conclude that he knew what\n\nhe was doing and intended to assist the drug conspiracy.                              Phone\n\ncalls captured on the wiretap between Rivera Maldonado and Rolando\n\nMotta-Morales, who cooked for the El Cerro group, linked Rivera\n\nMaldonado to the larger conspiracy.                      Rivera Maldonado was Motta-\n\nMorales's cousin and brother-in-law.                    A jury could have reasonably\n\nconcluded that, in those calls, Rivera Maldonado gave Motta-Morales\n\nconfidential police information to help Motta-Morales avoid police\n\ndetection.\n\n              On March 2, 2008, Motta-Morales called Rivera Maldonado.\n\nMotta-Morales reported that a white Ford Mustang had been following\n\nhim    and    provided       the       car's     license    plate.         Two     officers\n\ninvestigating the conspiracy had been using that car that day for\n\nsurveillance.\n\n              In response to this report, Rivera Maldonado went through\n\npolice       channels    and       learned        that     the    license     plate      was\n\nunregistered.           In   Puerto       Rico,       unregistered     license      plates\n\ntypically denote law enforcement vehicles.                       Although he knew this\n\ninformation was confidential and its release could jeopardize a\n\npolice investigation, Rivera Maldonado called Motta-Morales and\n\nreported that the license plate was unregistered. Rivera Maldonado\n\n\n                                               -9-\n\fwarned Motta-Morales to be careful and acknowledged that the plate\n\ncould belong to a police vehicle.\n\n          The officers in the vehicle, realizing from the wiretap\n\ntheir cover was blown, then tested for the source of the leak.\n\nThey drove the white Mustang to the police station on March 3.\n\nRivera Maldonado came out and inspected the car in the parking lot.\n\nThe officers approached Rivera Maldonado, told him they were using\n\nthe car to locate a fugitive in Palmarito, and asked Rivera\n\nMaldonado for help.   Rivera Maldonado told them his cousin, who\n\nlived in that area, had reported that car was watching him.     He\n\ncalled Motta-Morales, while standing with the investigators, and\n\ntold Motta-Morales that the car belonged to police.\n\n          About three hours later, Rivera Maldonado again called\n\nMotta-Morales and encouraged him to help find the fugitive, stating\n\nthat police would leave the area once the fugitive was captured.\n\nMotta-Morales agreed that he would prefer less police presence near\n\nhis home, observing that the police were placing too much \"heat\" on\n\nhis \"place.\"   On March 9, 2008, Rivera Maldonado called Motta-\n\nMorales again to report having seen strange cars on property Motta-\n\nMorales's family owned.\n\n          The jury could reasonably reject Rivera Maldonado's story\n\nthat he gave his cousin the license plate information because\n\nanother drug dealer, \"El Gordo,\" had threatened Motta-Morales's\n\nlife.   Rivera Maldonado testified that he believed the car could\n\n\n                               -10-\n\fbelong to El Gordo and did not know his cousin was involved in the\n\nEl Cerro drug conspiracy. Rivera Maldonado admitted, however, that\n\nhe   was   aware   that   Motta-Morales   knew    Chevres-Motta   and   that\n\nChevres-Motta ran a drug ring in El Cerro.         And although he claimed\n\nhe believed Motta-Morales's life was in danger, he never made a\n\nreport of Motta-Morales's phone call or took steps to protect him\n\nfrom a death threat.\n\n            A jury also could have inferred that Rivera Maldonado\n\nintended to further the conspiracy's aims by helping Motta-Morales\n\navoid police detection.      Rivera Maldonado knew that he gave Motta-\n\nMorales confidential information that could risk other officers'\n\ninvestigation and even lives. Rivera Maldonaldo also counseled his\n\ncousin to be careful and to help locate the fugitive, which would\n\nremove police scrutiny from Motta-Morales's area.\n\nB.          \"Overview\" Testimony by Agent Chavez\n\n            Evidentiary objections, including to overview testimony,\n\nare reviewed for abuse of discretion when they were preserved and\n\nfor plain error when they were not.2        See United States v. Hall,\n\n434 F.3d 42, 56-57 (1st Cir. 2006); United States v. Casas, 356\n\nF.3d 104, 113 (1st Cir. 2004).            Even if there was an error,\n\nhowever, we affirm if it was harmless.           See Hall, 434 F.3d at 57.\n\n\n\n      2\n          The defendants did not always clearly object to the\nfoundation for Agent Chavez's testimony. Although they may not\nhave preserved every concern they raise on appeal, we treat their\nobjections under the abuse-of-discretion standard.\n\n                                   -11-\n\f           Rivera-Perez, the seller, and Torres-Rodriguez, the crack\n\ncooker, object to the lay witness testimony of Special Agent Regino\n\nChavez, who was a lead investigator on this case.              While Agent\n\nChavez was testifying, the government played for the jury video\n\ntapes of conspiracy members participating in drug activity and\n\nwiretap recordings of phone conversations between conspirators.3\n\nOn appeal, the defendants argue that eighteen portions of this\n\ntestimony were improper \"overview\" testimony.\n\n           We break those portions into two categories.         First, the\n\ndefendants object to Chavez's testimony that placed the videos and\n\nrecordings in the context of this conspiracy.             He identified\n\nmembers of the conspiracy and their roles and related what they\n\nwere doing and saying to the broader conspiracy.              Second, they\n\ncontest Chavez's testimony translating for the jury how actions\n\ntaken on the video and statements made in the recordings related to\n\ndrug activity.    Chavez identified drug activity and interpreted\n\ncoded language.\n\n           We have previously cautioned that prosecutors should not\n\npermit   investigators   to   give    overview   testimony,   in   which   a\n\ngovernment witness testifies about the results of a criminal\n\ninvestigation, usually including aspects of the investigation the\n\n\n     3\n          The government played digital copies of video recordings\nmade on tape, after Agent Chavez testified that he had seen the\noriginal recordings and the digital copies were identical. Torres-\nRodriguez's argument that the digital copies violated the best\nevidence rule is meritless. See Fed. R.

Overview testimony at times involves a\n\nwitness's assertion of facts not based on his own knowledge when\n\nthose facts are not otherwise proven.               E.g., United States v.\n\nRodriguez, 525 F.3d 85, 95-96 (1st Cir. 2008); Casas, 356 F.3d at\n\n118-20.\n\n               The prohibition on overly broad overview testimony arises\n\nfrom the basic principle in the Federal Rules of Evidence that\n\nwitnesses,      other   than   experts   giving    expert    opinions,     should\n\ntestify from personal knowledge.         See Fed. R. Evid. 602, 701, 802;\n\nsee also, e.g., Casas, 356 F.3d at 118-20 (criticizing overview\n\ntestimony because it was not based on the witness's personal\n\nknowledge); United States v. Mazza, 792 F.2d 1210, 1214-16 (1st\n\nCir. 1986) (holding that an officer's testimony was inadmissible\n\nhearsay when he gave an overview of an investigation based in part\n\non what other officers told him).            A foundation should be laid\n\nestablishing the basis of a witness's knowledge, opinion, or\n\nexpertise.      See Fed. R. Evid. 602, 701, 702; see also, e.g., United\n\nStates    v.    García-Morales,    382   F.3d     12,   17   (1st   Cir.    2004)\n\n(criticizing overview testimony \"that [the defendant] was a member\n\nof the drug conspiracy, even though the prosecution had not yet\n\nintroduced evidence supporting this conclusion\"); 6 J.B Weinstein\n\n& M.A. Berger, Weinstein's Federal Evidence § 1006.04[3], at 1006-\n\n14 (J.M. McLaughlin ed., 2d ed. 2006) (\"It is improper . . . for a\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fparty to open its case with an overview witness who summarizes\n\nevidence that has not yet been presented to the jury.\").\n\n              The district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\nadmitting Chavez's testimony about how the videos and wiretap\n\nrecordings fit into the rest of the conspiracy as based on Chavez's\n\npersonal knowledge.      The prosecution laid a foundation that Chavez\n\nhad personal knowledge of the conspiracy and its membership.               He\n\nwas a lead investigator; went to El Cerro at least fifty times; and\n\nrepeatedly participated in video and personal surveillance, wiretap\n\nsurveillance, and controlled drug buys.              He testified that his\n\nknowledge was based on his personal observations.\n\n              If a proper foundation is laid, government witnesses may\n\ntestify about matters within their personal knowledge and give lay\n\nor, if qualified, exert opinion testimony.           Relevant here, we have\n\nlong   held    that   government   witnesses    with   experience   in    drug\n\ninvestigations may explain the drug trade and translate coded\n\nlanguage for juries, either through lay or, if qualified, expert\n\ntestimony.      See United States v. Santiago, 560 F.3d 62, 66 & n.1\n\n(1st Cir. 2009).      This testimony is not overview testimony and is\n\nproperly admitted.      See Casas, 356 F.3d at 119.\n\n              Chavez's testimony translating the videos and wiretap\n\nrecordings helped the jury understand evidence it was hearing and\n\nseeing.       E.g.,   Santiago,    560   F.3d   at   66.   The   jury    could\n\nindependently evaluate Chavez's interpretations, and the defendants\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fexhaustively     cross-examined    Chavez    about    possible      alternative\n\ninterpretations.\n\n         III.    CLAIMS OF LUIS ROSADO-PÉREZ AS TO HIS PLEA\n\n            Rosado-Pérez argues on appeal that his plea was invalid\n\nbecause the district court did not ensure that he knowingly and\n\nvoluntarily entered into several terms of his plea or ascertain\n\nthat a factual basis existed for his plea.                  Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n11(b)(2), (3).\n\n            Rosado-Pérez      concedes    that   he   did   not    raise    these\n\nobjections in the district court, and so our review is for plain\n\nerror.   United States v. Torres-Oliveras, 583 F.3d 37, 40-41 (1st\n\nCir. 2009); United States v. Serrano-Beauvaix, 400 F.3d 50, 53 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).     Rosado-Pérez must demonstrate that the district court\n\ncommitted    clear    error   affecting    his   substantial       rights    that\n\nundermined    the    \"fairness,   integrity,     or   public      reputation   of\n\njudicial proceedings.\"        Torres-Oliveras, 583 F.3d at 41.          To show\n\nhis substantial rights were affected, Rosado-Pérez must \"show a\n\nreasonable probability that, but for the [Rule 11] error, he would\n\nnot have entered the plea.\"       United States v. Borrero-Acevedo, 533\n\nF.3d 11, 16 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting United States v. Dominguez\n\nBenitez, 542 U.S. 74, 76 (2004)) (alteration in original) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\fA.           Voluntariness of Rosado-Pérez's Plea\n\n             Rosado-Pérez argues that he did not understand the type\n\nand    amount   of   drugs   he   was   pleading    to   having   conspired   to\n\ndistribute or that he was waiving his right to have the court\n\nconsider further sentence reductions under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).4\n\n             Even if Rosado-Pérez could demonstrate that he would not\n\nhave otherwise pled guilty, which he has not, he cannot show the\n\ncourt committed any error, much less plain error, by accepting his\n\nplea.5     The prosecutor reported, in Rosado-Pérez's presence, each\n\nof the three terms Rosado-Pérez claims he misunderstood.                      The\n\ndistrict court then explained them again to Rosado-Pérez and asked\n\nwhether the defendant understood.              Rosado-Pérez confirmed that he\n\ndid.\n\n             It is true there was some discussion at sentencing about\n\nthe type and quantity of drugs Rosado-Pérez had pled to conspiring\n\nto distribute.       But after reviewing the plea colloquy transcript,\n\n\n\n       4\n          Rosado-Pérez also argues that he did not understand the\nprosecutor's statement that several terms of his plea agreement\nmirrored the terms for other defendants in the case.           The\nprosecutor said that, like the other defendants, Rosado-Pérez was\nwaiving his right to appeal and to other downward departures or\nsentence reductions under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).\n     There was no plain error or even confusion about these terms.\nThe prosecutor proceeded to discuss these terms in greater depth,\nand the district court ensured that Rosado-Pérez understood them.\n       5\n           The prosecution does not press the waiver-of-appeal\nprovision of his plea before this court. We therefore need not\naddress Rosado-Pérez's claim that he did not understand his waiver\nof appeal.\n\n                                        -16-\n\fthe court, the prosecutor, and even defense counsel agreed that\n\nRosado-Pérez unambiguously pled to conspiring to distribute 1.5 to\n\n4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine.           Not only did Rosado-Pérez agree,\n\nduring the plea colloquy, that he was pleading to having conspired\n\nto   distribute     crack,   but   he    later   asked    what    effect   recent\n\namendments     to   crack    sentencing    would    have    on    his    sentence.\n\nMoreover, this drug type and amount corresponded accurately to the\n\nbase offense level to which Rosado-Pérez pled.\n\nB.         The Factual Basis for Rosado-Pérez's Plea\n\n           Before accepting a guilty plea, a district court must\n\nfind that a factual basis exists for the defendant's plea.                 Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 11(b)(3).      We look at the offense the defendant has pled\n\nto committing and ask whether \"the plea has a rational basis in\n\nfacts   that   the    defendant    concede[d]      or    that    the    government\n\nproffer[ed] as supported by credible evidence.\"             Serrano-Beauvaix,\n\n400 F.3d at 53 (quoting United States v. Gandia-Maysonet, 227 F.3d\n\n1, 6 (1st Cir. 2000)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n           The district court explained every element of count one,\n\nconspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute narcotics. The\n\ncourt explained both the elements of a conspiracy and the elements\n\nof possession of narcotics with intent to distribute. Rosado-Pérez\n\nconfirmed that he was admitting he committed that offense by\n\nacknowledging that he had acted as the district court recited and\n\nas the prosecutor had suggested in his version of the offense.\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\fThen       Rosado-Pérez   admitted    the   type   and   amount   of   narcotics\n\nunderlying that offense.\n\n               Rosado-Pérez argues that the court committed plain error,\n\nfirst, by not ascertaining the time frame of the conspiracy.                The\n\ndistrict court ascertained the facts essential to the offense\n\nRosado-Pérez was admitting he committed; it did not need to go into\n\nsuch great factual detail.           Cf. United States v. Jiminez, 498 F.3d\n\n82, 87 (1st Cir. 2007) (noting that the facts established at a plea\n\ncolloquy need only \"touch all the bases\" and need not develop the\n\ndefendant's guilt in depth).\n\n               Rosado-Pérez also argues that the kind of drug he was\n\npleading to was not adequately established because the prosecutor\n\noffered to stipulate that Rosado-Pérez had conspired to distribute\n\npowder rather than crack cocaine.6                 In the end, Rosado-Pérez\n\nexplicitly admitted to distributing crack and pled to conspiring to\n\ndistribute crack, and that plea was the basis of his sentence.\n\nThat admission provided a sufficient factual basis for the court to\n\naccept his plea, and there was no error.\n\n\n\n\n       6\n          At his plea colloquy, Rosado-Pérez's attorney stressed\nthat, although his client was pleading to having conspired to\ndistribute crack, the government had agreed to a sentence at the\nlow end of Rosado-Pérez's guidelines range.        The prosecutor\nresponded that, if the defendant was worried, the government would\nstipulate that Rosado-Pérez had distributed an amount of powder\nrather than crack cocaine that would have produced an identical\nguidelines range.    The defense apparently did not accept this\noffer.\n\n                                        -18-\n\f                     IV.\n\nWe affirm the judgments of conviction.\n\n\n\n\n                    -19-\n\f",

The four appealing defendants were\n\nconvicted for their roles in a conspiracy to distribute cocaine,\n\ncrack cocaine, and marijuana in Barriada San Miguel, known as El\n\nCerro, in Naranjito, Puerto Rico, from 2005 to 2007.      Three were\n\nconvicted after a jury trial, Marcos Rivera-Perez, Juan Carlos\n\nTorres-Rodriguez, and Emanuel Rivera Maldonado; and one by a guilty\n\nplea, Luis Rosado-Pérez.    Rivera Maldonado was a corrupt municipal\n\npolice officer who aided the conspiracy.\n\n            Rivera-Perez, Torres-Rodriguez, and Rivera Maldonado each\n\nchallenge the sufficiency of the evidence for their convictions.\n\nRivera-Perez and Torres-Rodriguez also argue that the government\n\nimproperly presented an overview witness. We affirm. The evidence\n\nsufficed, and a government agent witness did not give improper\n\noverview testimony.      He appropriately testified from personal\n\nknowledge and explained drug activity and coded language to the\n\njury, based on his experience.\n\n            Rosado-Pérez argues, for the first time on appeal, that\n\nhe did not understand the terms of his plea and that the district\n\ncourt did not ascertain that a sufficient factual basis supported\n\nhis plea.    On plain error review, we affirm, finding no error at\n\nall.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\f                      I.   FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n          The structure of the conspiracy and the appellants' roles\n\nin it are described below as a rational jury could have found;\n\nfurther facts relevant to the claims on appeal follow.\n\n          Between 2005 and 2007 Manuel Chevres-Motta, not a party\n\nto these appeals, led an organization that distributed cocaine,\n\ncrack cocaine, heroin, and marijuana in the El Cerro ward of\n\nNaranjito.   Each of the appellants worked for Chevres-Motta, in\n\nvarious roles.\n\n          Chevres-Motta's drug organization sold only to known or\n\nvouched-for clients, usually from El Cerro.     El Cerro's geography,\n\nwhich sets it apart from the rest of Naranjito, also limited the\n\nscope of this organization's drug trade.      El Cerro rests atop a\n\nhill, and only one road, which cuts through El Cerro, connects it\n\nto Naranjito.\n\n          El Cerro \"runners\" supplied street dealers with drugs and\n\nensured the dealers gave correct money to Chevres-Motta. \"Sellers\"\n\nthen sold those drugs at regular drug points in El Cerro, including\n\na basketball court and a nearby stairwell.         Sellers sold small\n\npackets of drugs out of black fanny packs, a characteristic of the\n\nEl Cerro organization.     \"Escorts,\" usually local drug users,\n\nbrought clients to drug points and vouched for them.\n\n          Luis   Rosado-Pérez   supervised   the   cocaine    trade   for\n\nChevres-Motta.   Marcos Rivera-Perez was a seller.           Juan Carlos\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fTorres-Rodriguez \"cooked\" cocaine hydrochloride into crack cocaine.\n\nAnd   Rivera   Maldonado,     a   Naranjito       municipal     police     officer,\n\nprovided information to the group.\n\n           The    conspiracy      first    came   to    the    attention    of   law\n\nenforcement      during   a     separate       drug    and     money    laundering\n\ninvestigation.      A confidential informant in that case set up a\n\nmeeting to sell drugs; Rolando Motta-Morales, a member of the\n\nconspiracy in this case, came to that drug meeting.               For two months\n\nin 2006, federal officials wiretapped Motta-Morales's phone and\n\nlearned that Motta-Morales cooked crack cocaine for his cousin,\n\nChevres-Motta.     They also learned that Torres-Rodriguez was Motta-\n\nMorales's neighbor and cooked crack with Motta-Morales, and that\n\nRivera Maldonado was Motta-Morales's cousin and brother-in-law, as\n\nwell as a corrupt officer.\n\n           Federal     officers         investigated     the    El     Cerro     drug\n\norganization     for   almost     two    years.        Investigators     conducted\n\npersonal and video surveillance, wiretapped phones, completed about\n\nthirteen controlled drug buys through an undercover police officer\n\nbuyer, and used a confidential informant from El Cerro.\n\n           On September 26, 2007, a federal grand jury handed up a\n\ntwenty-eight-count indictment against thirty individuals, including\n\nthe four on appeal in this case, for their participation in the\n\nconspiracy.    The defendants in this case were charged in count one\n\nwith conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute controlled\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fsubstances,      21    U.S.C.    §   846,    and    in    count   twenty-eight    with\n\ncriminal forfeiture, id. §§ 853, 881.1\n\n               On May 2, 2008, a jury convicted Rivera-Perez, the\n\nseller, Torres-Rodriguez, the crack cooker, and Rivera Maldonado,\n\nthe corrupt officer, on the conspiracy count, count one.                      The jury\n\nalso       imposed    criminal   forfeiture        on    Rivera-Perez   and   Torres-\n\nRodriguez.           On August 11, 2008, the district court sentenced\n\nRivera-Perez and Torres-Rodriguez to 120 months in prison and\n\nRivera Maldonado to 48 months in prison.                    It also sentenced all\n\nthree defendants to five years' supervised release and a $100\n\nspecial assessment.\n\n               Earlier,    on    March   14,      2008,   Luis    Rosado-Pérez,    the\n\nsupervisor of the cocaine trade, had pled guilty to the conspiracy\n\nand forfeiture counts, specifically to conspiring to distribute\n\nbetween 1.5 and 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine.                      That quantity,\n\ncombined with Rosado-Pérez's criminal history category, gave him a\n\nbase offense level of 33 after a three-level downward departure for\n\nacceptance of responsibility. Rosado-Pérez's sentencing guidelines\n\nrange was 135 to 168 months.                      The government, per the plea\n\nagreement, recommended a sentence of 135 months in prison, which\n\nthe court accepted and imposed.\n\n\n\n       1\n          Marcos Rivera-Perez was also charged in count twenty-\nseven with dealing in firearms without a license, 18 U.S.C.\n§ 922(a)(1)(A). That charge was not submitted to the jury and was\ndismissed at sentencing.\n\n                                            -5-\n\fII.    CLAIMS OF MARCOS RIVERA-PEREZ, JUAN CARLOS TORRES-RODRIGUEZ,\n        AND EMANUEL RIVERA MALDONADO AS TO THEIR CONVICTIONS\n\n            Three defendants argue that the evidence of intent and\n\nagreement to participate in the conspiracy was insufficient for a\n\nconviction.       Rivera-Perez and Torres-Rodriguez also argue that the\n\ncourt    erred    in    admitting        the    testimony     of   Federal     Bureau    of\n\nInvestigation Special Agent Regino Chavez, alleging Chavez gave\n\nimproper \"overview\" testimony.                 We reject both claims.\n\nA.          Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n            We     review      the       sufficiency    of    the     evidence    for    a\n\nconviction de novo.

Evidence of a knowing agreement could include\n\nevidence that the defendants took actions that furthered the\n\nconspiracy's goals.           United States v. García-Pastrana, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"204077\"><a href=\"/opinion/204077/united-states-v-garcia-pastrana/\"><span class=\"volume\">584</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">351</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 377 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n\n\n                                               -6-\n\f          1.     Marcos Rivera-Perez\n\n          Marcos Rivera-Perez admits on appeal, as he conceded\n\nwhile testifying at trial, that he sold drugs in El Cerro, but he\n\nsays the evidence did not show he sold drugs for the Chevres-Motta\n\nconspiracy.\n\n          Sufficient   evidence    connected   Rivera-Perez   to   the\n\nChevres-Motta conspiracy. Both a lead investigator in the case and\n\na confidential informant identified him and testified that he sold\n\ndrugs in El Cerro.     Videos showed him selling drugs from black\n\nfanny packs, as the conspiracy's other sellers did.     Rivera-Perez\n\nwas shown selling drugs from the stairwell near the basketball\n\ncourt, a regular drug point for this conspiracy.       Videos showed\n\nRivera-Perez selling to, interacting with, and standing nearby\n\nknown conspiracy members and clients.\n\n          A jury could easily reject the idea that Chevres-Motta\n\nand his coconspirators would permit a competing drug dealer to sell\n\nin the heart of their small, isolated neighborhood at one of their\n\nusual drug points.   A reasonable juror instead could conclude that\n\nRivera-Perez sold drugs for this conspiracy and therefore agreed\n\nand intended to further its aims.\n\n          2.     Juan Carlos Torres-Rodriguez\n\n          Torres-Rodriguez, the crack cooker, who lived twenty\n\nminutes from El Cerro, also argues that the evidence showed at most\n\n\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fhe cooked crack with his neighbor, Motta-Morales, but not for the\n\nrest of the El Cerro conspiracy led by Chevres-Motta.\n\n               The evidence was sufficient.       In several phone calls,\n\nplayed    at    trial,   Torres-Rodriguez   and   Motta-Morales   discussed\n\ncooking    crack    together.     The   evidence   supported   the   jury's\n\nconclusion that they were collaborating to cook crack for Chevres-\n\nMotta's El Cerro organization for two reasons.\n\n               First, the jury heard many phone calls in which Motta-\n\nMorales discussed his work as a cooker with a number of conspiracy\n\nmembers over a period of months.            In particular, Motta-Morales\n\ndiscussed his work with the conspiracy leader, Chevres-Motta, who\n\nwas Motta-Morales's cousin.          He reported his progress cooking\n\ncrack, discussed how to buy more cocaine to cook, and planned how\n\nto deliver drugs to Chevres-Motta and receive payment.\n\n               Second, many calls played before the jury between Torres-\n\nRodriguez and Motta-Morales supported the inference that they were\n\nworking for Chevres-Motta, since they referenced Chevres-Motta\n\nseveral times by his street name.             Motta-Morales reported to\n\nTorres-Rodriguez Chevres-Motta's instructions and comments about\n\ntheir work cooking crack, and he did so once shortly after he had\n\nended a call with Chevres-Motta.\n\n               3.     Emanuel Rivera Maldonado\n\n               Rivera Maldonado, the former Naranjito municipal police\n\nofficer, urges that the evidence did not show that he intended to\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fhelp a drug conspiracy or even that he knew he had spoken with a\n\nconspiracy member; he says he was simply helping family.                           He did,\n\nfrom   his    position       as    a    police       officer,    provide    help    to   the\n\nconspiracy, and a reasonable jury could conclude that he knew what\n\nhe was doing and intended to assist the drug conspiracy.                              Phone\n\ncalls captured on the wiretap between Rivera Maldonado and Rolando\n\nMotta-Morales, who cooked for the El Cerro group, linked Rivera\n\nMaldonado to the larger conspiracy.                      Rivera Maldonado was Motta-\n\nMorales's cousin and brother-in-law.                    A jury could have reasonably\n\nconcluded that, in those calls, Rivera Maldonado gave Motta-Morales\n\nconfidential police information to help Motta-Morales avoid police\n\ndetection.\n\n              On March 2, 2008, Motta-Morales called Rivera Maldonado.\n\nMotta-Morales reported that a white Ford Mustang had been following\n\nhim    and    provided       the       car's     license    plate.         Two     officers\n\ninvestigating the conspiracy had been using that car that day for\n\nsurveillance.\n\n              In response to this report, Rivera Maldonado went through\n\npolice       channels    and       learned        that     the    license     plate      was\n\nunregistered.           In   Puerto       Rico,       unregistered     license      plates\n\ntypically denote law enforcement vehicles.                       Although he knew this\n\ninformation was confidential and its release could jeopardize a\n\npolice investigation, Rivera Maldonado called Motta-Morales and\n\nreported that the license plate was unregistered. Rivera Maldonado\n\n\n                                               -9-\n\fwarned Motta-Morales to be careful and acknowledged that the plate\n\ncould belong to a police vehicle.\n\n          The officers in the vehicle, realizing from the wiretap\n\ntheir cover was blown, then tested for the source of the leak.\n\nThey drove the white Mustang to the police station on March 3.\n\nRivera Maldonado came out and inspected the car in the parking lot.\n\nThe officers approached Rivera Maldonado, told him they were using\n\nthe car to locate a fugitive in Palmarito, and asked Rivera\n\nMaldonado for help.   Rivera Maldonado told them his cousin, who\n\nlived in that area, had reported that car was watching him.     He\n\ncalled Motta-Morales, while standing with the investigators, and\n\ntold Motta-Morales that the car belonged to police.\n\n          About three hours later, Rivera Maldonado again called\n\nMotta-Morales and encouraged him to help find the fugitive, stating\n\nthat police would leave the area once the fugitive was captured.\n\nMotta-Morales agreed that he would prefer less police presence near\n\nhis home, observing that the police were placing too much \"heat\" on\n\nhis \"place.\"   On March 9, 2008, Rivera Maldonado called Motta-\n\nMorales again to report having seen strange cars on property Motta-\n\nMorales's family owned.\n\n          The jury could reasonably reject Rivera Maldonado's story\n\nthat he gave his cousin the license plate information because\n\nanother drug dealer, \"El Gordo,\" had threatened Motta-Morales's\n\nlife.   Rivera Maldonado testified that he believed the car could\n\n\n                               -10-\n\fbelong to El Gordo and did not know his cousin was involved in the\n\nEl Cerro drug conspiracy. Rivera Maldonado admitted, however, that\n\nhe   was   aware   that   Motta-Morales   knew    Chevres-Motta   and   that\n\nChevres-Motta ran a drug ring in El Cerro.         And although he claimed\n\nhe believed Motta-Morales's life was in danger, he never made a\n\nreport of Motta-Morales's phone call or took steps to protect him\n\nfrom a death threat.\n\n            A jury also could have inferred that Rivera Maldonado\n\nintended to further the conspiracy's aims by helping Motta-Morales\n\navoid police detection.      Rivera Maldonado knew that he gave Motta-\n\nMorales confidential information that could risk other officers'\n\ninvestigation and even lives. Rivera Maldonaldo also counseled his\n\ncousin to be careful and to help locate the fugitive, which would\n\nremove police scrutiny from Motta-Morales's area.\n\nB.          \"Overview\" Testimony by Agent Chavez\n\n            Evidentiary objections, including to overview testimony,\n\nare reviewed for abuse of discretion when they were preserved and\n\nfor plain error when they were not.2        See United States v.

Even if there was an error,\n\nhowever, we affirm if it was harmless.           See Hall, 434 F.3d at 57.\n\n\n\n      2\n          The defendants did not always clearly object to the\nfoundation for Agent Chavez's testimony. Although they may not\nhave preserved every concern they raise on appeal, we treat their\nobjections under the abuse-of-discretion standard.\n\n                                   -11-\n\f           Rivera-Perez, the seller, and Torres-Rodriguez, the crack\n\ncooker, object to the lay witness testimony of Special Agent Regino\n\nChavez, who was a lead investigator on this case.              While Agent\n\nChavez was testifying, the government played for the jury video\n\ntapes of conspiracy members participating in drug activity and\n\nwiretap recordings of phone conversations between conspirators.3\n\nOn appeal, the defendants argue that eighteen portions of this\n\ntestimony were improper \"overview\" testimony.\n\n           We break those portions into two categories.         First, the\n\ndefendants object to Chavez's testimony that placed the videos and\n\nrecordings in the context of this conspiracy.             He identified\n\nmembers of the conspiracy and their roles and related what they\n\nwere doing and saying to the broader conspiracy.              Second, they\n\ncontest Chavez's testimony translating for the jury how actions\n\ntaken on the video and statements made in the recordings related to\n\ndrug activity.    Chavez identified drug activity and interpreted\n\ncoded language.\n\n           We have previously cautioned that prosecutors should not\n\npermit   investigators   to   give    overview   testimony,   in   which   a\n\ngovernment witness testifies about the results of a criminal\n\ninvestigation, usually including aspects of the investigation the\n\n\n     3\n          The government played digital copies of video recordings\nmade on tape, after Agent Chavez testified that he had seen the\noriginal recordings and the digital copies were identical. Torres-\nRodriguez's argument that the digital copies violated the best\nevidence rule is meritless. See Fed. R. Evid. 1003.\n\n                                     -12-\n\fwitness did not participate in, before the government has presented\n\nsupporting evidence.           Overview testimony at times involves a\n\nwitness's assertion of facts not based on his own knowledge when\n\nthose facts are not otherwise proven.

The prosecution laid a foundation that Chavez\n\nhad personal knowledge of the conspiracy and its membership.               He\n\nwas a lead investigator; went to El Cerro at least fifty times; and\n\nrepeatedly participated in video and personal surveillance, wiretap\n\nsurveillance, and controlled drug buys.              He testified that his\n\nknowledge was based on his personal observations.\n\n              If a proper foundation is laid, government witnesses may\n\ntestify about matters within their personal knowledge and give lay\n\nor, if qualified, exert opinion testimony.           Relevant here, we have\n\nlong   held    that   government   witnesses    with   experience   in    drug\n\ninvestigations may explain the drug trade and translate coded\n\nlanguage for juries, either through lay or, if qualified, expert\n\ntestimony.

E.g.,   Santiago,    560   F.3d   at   66.   The   jury    could\n\nindependently evaluate Chavez's interpretations, and the defendants\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fexhaustively     cross-examined    Chavez    about    possible      alternative\n\ninterpretations.\n\n         III.    CLAIMS OF LUIS ROSADO-PÉREZ AS TO HIS PLEA\n\n            Rosado-Pérez argues on appeal that his plea was invalid\n\nbecause the district court did not ensure that he knowingly and\n\nvoluntarily entered into several terms of his plea or ascertain\n\nthat a factual basis existed for his plea.

Voluntariness of Rosado-Pérez's Plea\n\n             Rosado-Pérez argues that he did not understand the type\n\nand    amount   of   drugs   he   was   pleading    to   having   conspired   to\n\ndistribute or that he was waiving his right to have the court\n\nconsider further sentence reductions under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).4\n\n             Even if Rosado-Pérez could demonstrate that he would not\n\nhave otherwise pled guilty, which he has not, he cannot show the\n\ncourt committed any error, much less plain error, by accepting his\n\nplea.5     The prosecutor reported, in Rosado-Pérez's presence, each\n\nof the three terms Rosado-Pérez claims he misunderstood.                      The\n\ndistrict court then explained them again to Rosado-Pérez and asked\n\nwhether the defendant understood.              Rosado-Pérez confirmed that he\n\ndid.\n\n             It is true there was some discussion at sentencing about\n\nthe type and quantity of drugs Rosado-Pérez had pled to conspiring\n\nto distribute.       But after reviewing the plea colloquy transcript,\n\n\n\n       4\n          Rosado-Pérez also argues that he did not understand the\nprosecutor's statement that several terms of his plea agreement\nmirrored the terms for other defendants in the case.           The\nprosecutor said that, like the other defendants, Rosado-Pérez was\nwaiving his right to appeal and to other downward departures or\nsentence reductions under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).\n     There was no plain error or even confusion about these terms.\nThe prosecutor proceeded to discuss these terms in greater depth,\nand the district court ensured that Rosado-Pérez understood them.\n       5\n           The prosecution does not press the waiver-of-appeal\nprovision of his plea before this court. We therefore need not\naddress Rosado-Pérez's claim that he did not understand his waiver\nof appeal.\n\n                                        -16-\n\fthe court, the prosecutor, and even defense counsel agreed that\n\nRosado-Pérez unambiguously pled to conspiring to distribute 1.5 to\n\n4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine.           Not only did Rosado-Pérez agree,\n\nduring the plea colloquy, that he was pleading to having conspired\n\nto   distribute     crack,   but   he    later   asked    what    effect   recent\n\namendments     to   crack    sentencing    would    have    on    his    sentence.\n\nMoreover, this drug type and amount corresponded accurately to the\n\nbase offense level to which Rosado-Pérez pled.\n\nB.         The Factual Basis for Rosado-Pérez's Plea\n\n           Before accepting a guilty plea, a district court must\n\nfind that a factual basis exists for the defendant's plea.                 Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 11(b)(3).      We look at the offense the defendant has pled\n\nto committing and ask whether \"the plea has a rational basis in\n\nfacts   that   the    defendant    concede[d]      or    that    the    government\n\nproffer[ed] as supported by credible evidence.\"             Serrano-Beauvaix,\n\n400 F.3d at 53 (quoting United States v.

The\n\ncourt explained both the elements of a conspiracy and the elements\n\nof possession of narcotics with intent to distribute. Rosado-Pérez\n\nconfirmed that he was admitting he committed that offense by\n\nacknowledging that he had acted as the district court recited and\n\nas the prosecutor had suggested in his version of the offense.\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\fThen       Rosado-Pérez   admitted    the   type   and   amount   of   narcotics\n\nunderlying that offense.\n\n               Rosado-Pérez argues that the court committed plain error,\n\nfirst, by not ascertaining the time frame of the conspiracy.                The\n\ndistrict court ascertained the facts essential to the offense\n\nRosado-Pérez was admitting he committed; it did not need to go into\n\nsuch great factual detail.           Cf. United States v. Jiminez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202892\"><a href=\"/opinion/202892/united-states-v-jiminez/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">82</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 87 (1st Cir. 2007) (noting that the facts established at a plea\n\ncolloquy need only \"touch all the bases\" and need not develop the\n\ndefendant's guilt in depth).\n\n               Rosado-Pérez also argues that the kind of drug he was\n\npleading to was not adequately established because the prosecutor\n\noffered to stipulate that Rosado-Pérez had conspired to distribute\n\npowder rather than crack cocaine.6                 In the end, Rosado-Pérez\n\nexplicitly admitted to distributing crack and pled to conspiring to\n\ndistribute crack, and that plea was the basis of his sentence.\n\nThat admission provided a sufficient factual basis for the court to\n\naccept his plea, and there was no error.\n\n\n\n\n       6\n          At his plea colloquy, Rosado-Pérez's attorney stressed\nthat, although his client was pleading to having conspired to\ndistribute crack, the government had agreed to a sentence at the\nlow end of Rosado-Pérez's guidelines range.        The prosecutor\nresponded that, if the defendant was worried, the government would\nstipulate that Rosado-Pérez had distributed an amount of powder\nrather than crack cocaine that would have produced an identical\nguidelines range.    The defense apparently did not accept this\noffer.\n\n                                        -18-\n\f                     IV.\n\nWe affirm the judgments of conviction.\n\n\n\n\n                    -19-\n\f</pre>",
