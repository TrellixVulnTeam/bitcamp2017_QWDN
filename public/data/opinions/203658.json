The Sierra Club, along with two\n\nother conservation groups (for simplicity we refer only to the\n\nSierra Club), challenges the Forest Service's approval of two\n\nforest resource management projects in the White Mountain National\n\nForest (\"Forest\" or \"WMNF\"): the Than Forest Resource Management\n\nProject   (\"Than   Project\")   and    the    Batchelder    Brook     Vegetation\n\nManagement Project (\"Batchelder Project\").             The district court's\n\ndecision,    upholding   the   Forest       Service,      provides    detailed\n\nbackground, Sierra Club v. Wagner, ___ F. Supp. 2d ___, 2008 WL\n\n2336902, at *1-5 (D.N.H. Jun. 6, 2008), which we summarize here.\n\n            The Forest Service, an agency of the U.S. Department of\n\nAgriculture, is responsible for national forests.               The National\n\nForest Management Act (\"NFMA\"), 16 U.S.C. §§ 472a, 521b, 1600 et\n\nseq. (2006), provides for management of national forests at two\n\nlevels, the programmatic (or plan) level and the project level\n\n(where the Forest Service implements the broader programs and goals\n\nlaid out in the forest plan).        Ohio Forestry Ass'n v. Sierra Club,\n\n523 U.S. 726, 729-30 (1998).\n\n            All projects within a forest must comply with the overall\n\nplan for that forest, 16 U.S.C. § 1604(i), which is revised\n\nperiodically, id. § 1604(f)(5).             The governing White Mountain\n\nNational Forest Land and Resource Management Plan was most recently\n\nrevised and adopted in September 2005 (\"the 2005 Plan\").               The 2005\n\nPlan was revised pursuant to the 1982 forest service regulations\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f(\"the 1982 rules\"), which could still permissibly be considered for\n\nPlan revisions when the new plan was adopted.                 See 36 C.F.R. §\n\n219.35(b).\n\n               The White Mountain National Forest covers almost 800,000\n\nacres in northern New Hampshire and western Maine.              The governing\n\n2005       Plan   promotes   multiple    uses    for   the   Forest   including\n\nrecreation, timber harvesting, and preservation of wildlife and\n\nwilderness, as required by the NFMA.             16 U.S.C. §§ 1604(a), (e).\n\nThe 2005 Plan classifies approximately 281,000 acres in the WMNF as\n\nappropriate for harvesting timber, but currently harvesting is\n\nallowed only on roughly 3,400 acres annually, a tiny fraction of\n\nthe forest.\n\n               During the 2005 Plan revision process, the land was\n\ninventoried to determine whether it qualified as \"roadless.\"                  36\n\nC.F.R. § 219.17(a) (1983).              In the eastern United States, to\n\nqualify as roadless, land must meet certain environmental standards\n\nincluding very few constructed roads or recent timber harvesting.1\n\nTwenty-seven areas, totaling 403,000 acres, met these criteria and\n\ncomprise      inventoried    roadless    areas    (\"IRA's\"),    which   can   be\n\ndesignated by Congress as Wilderness Areas, thereby affording the\n\n\n       1\n      To qualify requires a natural, untrammeled appearance;\nimprovements in the area must be disappearing or muted; the\nlocation must be conducive to perpetuating wilderness values; the\narea may contain no more than one-half mile of improved road for\neach 1,000 acres; and only twenty percent or less of the area may\nhave been the subject of timber harvesting within the past ten\nyears. Forest Serv. Handbook 1909.12, § 7.12 (1992).\n\n                                        -3-\n\flands special protection, 16 U.S.C. § 1132(b).                 The Forest Service\n\nrecommended that Congress so designate 34,500 acres over and above\n\nthe 114,000 acres previously protected.\n\n           After adoption of the 2005 Plan, the Forest Service\n\nevaluated various management areas within the Forest to determine\n\nwhat new projects were required to achieve the 2005 Plan goals.                   It\n\ndetermined, for the areas encompassing the Than and Batchelder\n\nprojects, that more diverse habitats, including new vegetation in\n\nyounger age classes, were needed and that it would be beneficial to\n\nharvest   some      mature   trees   to    create     room    for    younger    trees\n\n(creating what is known as early successional habitat).\n\n           Ultimately the Forest Service proposed to allow timber\n\nharvesting     of    approximately      929   acres    in     the    Than    project,\n\ncreating up to 231 acres of early successional habitat.                         Some\n\nexisting roads would receive maintenance or reconstruction, and a\n\n500 foot section of new road was planned.                   Part of this project\n\nwould affect the Wild River Inventoried Roadless Area, including\n\n464 acres of timber harvesting in that area.\n\n           The      other    proposed     action,   the      Batchelder      Project,\n\ninvolved harvesting on 380 acres, including 139 acres within the\n\nSouth   Carr   Mountain      Inventoried      Roadless       Area.     The    Project\n\nrequires no new road construction, but does authorize maintenance\n\non approximately three miles of road, one-half mile of which is\n\nlocated in the South Carr Mountain IRA.\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\f            The National Environmental Policy Act (\"NEPA\"), 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 4321 et seq., obligates agencies such as the Forest Service to\n\nevaluate the environmental impacts of its proposed actions. Dubois\n\nv. U.S. Dep't of Agriculture, 102 F.3d 1273, 1284 (1st Cir. 1996),\n\ncert. denied sub. nom. Loon Mtn. Recreation Corp. v. Dubois, 521\n\nU.S. 1119 (1997).        To comply with NEPA, the Forest Service was\n\nfirst   required    to    determine         whether    either      the    Than   or   the\n\nBatchelder Project would have a significant environmental impact.\n\n40 C.F.R. § 1501.4 (2007); Save Our Heritage, Inc. v. F.A.A., 269\n\nF.3d 49, 57 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n            A detailed environmental impact statement (\"EIS\") is\n\nrequired whenever proposed actions will \"significantly affect the\n\nquality of the human environment.\"                42 U.S.C. § 4332; 40 C.F.R. §§\n\n1502.1, 1502.14; Dubois, 102 F.3d at 1285.                      If uncertain about\n\nimpact, the agency may start with a less detailed Environmental\n\nAssessment    (\"EA\");     40    C.F.R.      §     1501.3.     If    the    EA    finds   a\n\nsignificant impact, a full EIS must be prepared; if not, the agency\n\nmakes   a   \"Finding     of    No   Significant       Impact\"      (\"FONSI\"),      which\n\nexhausts    its   obligation        under    NEPA.      Id.   §§    1501.4,      1508.9,\n\n1508.13.\n\n            The Forest Service prepared an EIS in connection with the\n\n2005 Plan revision and it was also required to prepare either an\n\nEIS or EA for both the Than and Batchelder projects.                       40 C.F.R. §\n\n1501.4; see also Blue Mountains Biodiversity Project v. Blackwood,\n\n\n                                            -5-\n\f161 F.3d 1208, 1214 (9th Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 527 U.S. 1003\n\n(1999).   Under the 2005 Plan, specific projects' environmental\n\nanalyses may incorporate by reference (\"tier\") information that is\n\nin the Plan EIS, so an EA need not start from scratch.             40 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1508.28.\n\n              The Forest Service prepared an initial EA for the Than\n\nProject in May 2006 but, after an administrative appeal, issued in\n\nNovember 2006 a revised EA for public comment.               After receiving\n\ncomments and after an injunction deferred the operation of new\n\nForest Service rules relied on in the November 2006 draft, the\n\nForest Service revised the EA and issued the final Than EA in April\n\n2007.\n\n              Despite certain possible adverse effects of the Than\n\nProject on the Wild River Inventoried Roadless Area--including\n\nsediment inputs to streams, some soil disturbance, and effects on\n\nstream temperature--the Forest Service concluded that the project\n\nwould\n\n              not significantly alter the character of the\n              area or the qualities which qualified it for\n              inclusion in the inventory . . . because the\n              harvests are of limited intensity and minimal\n              road systems will be used [and that there\n              would be no] lasting or significant effect on\n              the roadless character of the area.\n\nIt   issued    a   FONSI   and   thereafter   denied   the    Sierra   Club's\n\nadministrative appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f           As for the Batchelder project, an initial EA draft was\n\nwithdrawn when the initial Than EA was set aside; a revised EA was\n\nissued in December 2006 for public comment followed by a final EA\n\nand a revised decision notice with a FONSI in May 2007.             The FONSI\n\nconceded   certain   potential     adverse   effects    (on     wildlife   and\n\npossible   sedimentation     of    streams),   but     concluded    that    no\n\nsignificant impact would result on the South Carr Mountain Area's\n\nroadless   or   wilderness        characteristics.        A     Sierra     Club\n\nadministrative appeal was thereafter denied.\n\n           In August 2007, the Sierra Club filed a complaint in the\n\ndistrict court challenging the Than Project.                  It amended its\n\ncomplaint to incorporate claims regarding the Batchelder Brook\n\nProject in October 2007.      On cross-motions for summary judgment,\n\nthe district court upheld the Forest Service's actions, granted the\n\nForest Service's motion and denied Sierra Club's. We denied a stay\n\npending appeal but expedited the case.\n\n           On appeal, Sierra Club claims error by the Forest Service\n\nin several respects.   We review questions of law de novo, WorldNet\n\nTelecommunications, Inc. v. Puerto Rico Telephone Co., 497 F.3d 1,\n\n5 (1st Cir. 2007), but are deferential to the agency in its\n\ninterpretation of its own rules, Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural\n\nRes. Def. Council, 467 U.S. 837, 843-44 (1984), and in judgment\n\ncalls as to the likely impact of proposed actions.                 Associated\n\nFisheries of Maine, Inc. v. Daley, 127 F.3d 104, 109 (1st Cir.\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f1997).   The latter, reflected in the FONSI findings, are to be\n\nupheld unless arbitrary and capricious.     Marsh v. Oregon Natural\n\nRes. Council, 490 U.S. 360, 374, 376 (1989); see also 5 U.S.C. §\n\n706(2)(A).\n\n          Sierra Club argues first that the Forest Service erred by\n\napplying the \"best available science\" standard found in the Forest\n\nService rules, adopted in 2000, see 36 C.F.R. § 219.35(a) (2001),\n\nto its evaluation of the Than and Batchelder Brook projects, rather\n\nthan a set of rules adopted in 1982.   One might think from the name\n\nthat \"best available science\" is an unexceptionable standard, but\n\naccording to Sierra Club, the 1982 rules provided a set of precise\n\ntests for evaluating a project's impact on species that are more\n\nrigorous and were intentionally weakened by the 2000 rules.\n\n          Its brief provides a short description of the difference\n\nand, as the characterization is not denied by the Forest Service's\n\nbrief, we will assume it to be true.      See Forest Watch v. U.S.\n\nForest Serv., 410 F.3d 115, 116-17 (2d Cir. 2005). However, Sierra\n\nClub's brief fails to explain whether or how the allegedly more\n\nrigorous standards of the 1982 rules would likely have altered the\n\nForest Service's ultimate evaluation of the two projects. This may\n\nnot derail the argument but it reduces one's enthusiasm for it.\n\n          In all events, Sierra Club contends that the 1982 rules\n\napply in this case, and understanding the argument requires a brief\n\nexcursion.   When the new 2000 NFMA rules were announced, their\n\n\n                               -8-\n\ftransition provision deferred many of the new rules until November\n\n2003 (a date thereafter extended)2; but the provision said that\n\neffective immediately the Forest Service \"must consider the best\n\navailable science in implementing . . . the current plan.\"                  36\n\nC.F.R. § 219.35(a).       The parties take this language to supercede\n\nthe allegedly more stringent 1982 rules on species evaluation, but\n\ndisagree as to whether the transition provision covers the two\n\nprojects in issue here.\n\n          Sierra    Club    argues   that   the    plain   language   of   the\n\ntransition    provision    applies   only   to    forest   plans   that    were\n\n\"current\" when the transition provision was adopted in 2000.               See\n\nUtah Environmental Congress v. Troyer, 479 F.3d 1269, 1272-74 (10th\n\nCir. 2007).    And, the argument goes, the 2005 Plan for the forest\n\n(which had been implemented when the two projects were approved)\n\nwas not \"current\" in 2000. The Forest Service counters that Sierra\n\nClub waived this argument because it was not presented to the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n          Ordinarily, arguments not raised in the district court\n\ncannot be raised for the first time on appeal.                 E.g., Boston\n\n\n     2\n      The extensions continued until January 2005 when a revised\nset of rules were adopted, which (according to Sierra Club) are\neven weaker in protecting the environment; but they have been\nenjoined nationwide pendente lite, Citizens for Better Forestry v.\nU.S. Dep't of Agriculture, 481 F. Supp. 2d 1059, 1100 (N.D. Cal.\n2007), so prior rules, including the 2000 transition provision,\nseemingly remain in effect for the present. See Action on Smoking\n& Health v. Civil Aeronautics Bd., 713 F.2d 795, 797 (D.C. Cir.\n1983).\n\n                                     -9-\n\fCeltics Ltd. P'ship v. Shaw, 908 F.2d 1041, 1045 (1st Cir.1990).\n\nSierra Club agrees that it did not raise its \"current plan\"\n\nargument in the district court but says that it did there oppose\n\nthe \"best available science\" standard on other grounds and this is\n\nenough to allow us to consider its new legal theory in support of\n\nthe same result.    This is a misunderstanding of the requirements\n\nfor preserving issues for review.\n\n          We can affirm a judgment on a legal ground not relied\n\nupon in the district court, Plymouth Sav. Bank v. I.R.S., 187 F.3d\n\n203, 209-10 (1st Cir. 1999)--after all, why send the case back if\n\nthe result was right--but it is altogether different to reverse a\n\njudgment on a ground never raised in the lower court.    See In re\n\nBoston Reg'l Med. Ctr., 291 F.3d 111, 125 n.16 (1st Cir. 2002).   We\n\nmay ourselves choose to consider newly minted arguments from the\n\nparties, or devise them ourselves, but this is not an entitlement\n\nof the parties.3   See, e.g., United States v. La Guardia, 902 F.2d\n\n1010, 1013 (1st Cir. 1990)).\n\n          In sum, the Sierra Club has forfeited the argument, and\n\nwe decline to consider it.   The 2005 rules have been enjoined but\n\n\n\n     3\n      For example, we may choose to hear an argument not raised\nbelow in “cases that involv[e] important constitutional or\ngovernmental issues [which are] exceptional . . . and, as such\n[warrant] a full legal treatment of all legal issues involved,\nwhether squarely introduced by the parties or not.” TI Fed. Credit\nUnion v. DelBonis, 72 F.3d 921, 930 (1st Cir. 1995) (citing Nat'l\nAss'n of Social Workers v. Harwood, 69 F.3d 622, 628 (1st\nCir.1995)).\n\n                                -10-\n\fto return to the 1982 rules, instead of the 2000 transition\n\nprovision, is not appealing where, as here, Sierra Club has not\n\ntroubled to explain why the outcome would change (delay aside) if\n\nthe 1982 rules were applied.     Nor do we find the Forest Service's\n\nreading of the transition provision patently wrong, a circumstance\n\nthat might help persuade us to excuse the forfeiture.\n\n           Utah Envtl. Cong. v. Troyer, 479 F.3d 1269, 1281 (10th\n\nCir. 2007), agrees with Sierra Club's belated argument--indeed,\n\nprobably   prompted   it--but   Troyer      is   quite   possibly    wrong   in\n\nthinking the word \"current\" can yield only one meaning. And Troyer\n\nis at odds with a 2004 interpretive rule issued by the Forest\n\nService, 69 Fed. Reg. 58055, 58057 (2004),4 ordinarily entitled to\n\n\"substantial     deference\"   where   the    subject     is   \"the   agency's\n\ninterpretation of its own regulations.\"           N. Wind, Inc. v. Daley,\n\n200 F.3d 13, 17 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n           Next, Sierra Club contends that the Than Project EA was\n\nbased on the Management Indicator Species Provision of the 2005\n\nrules, 36 C.F.R. § 219.14(f) (2005), which were enjoined nationwide\n\nin March 2007.    See Citizens for Better Forestry, 481 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 1100.    Admittedly, the final Than Project EA says once that\n\n\"[t]he analysis of MIS [the species analysis] was undertaken in the\n\n\n     4\n      The rule, directly addressing the claim now advanced by the\nSierra Club as to the meaning of its transition rule, states that\n\"the best available science\" standard should be used in\n\"implementing national forest land management plans.\" 69 Fed. Reg.\nat 58,056.\n\n                                  -11-\n\fcontext of 36 C.F.R. § 219.14(f)\" [which is only found in the\n\nenjoined 2005 rules].    Below, the Forest Service disclaimed this\n\nreference as a typographical error--and the district court agreed.\n\n            It appears that when the revised draft Than EA was\n\npublished for public comment in 2006, the 2005 rules had been\n\nadopted as a rewriting of the long deferred 2000 rules.     Once the\n\ninjunction against the 2005 rules issued, the Forest Service\n\nremoved almost all of the references in the draft to the 2005 rules\n\nand issued the final Than Project EA shortly thereafter, relying\n\ninstead on the 2000 transition provision's \"best available science\"\n\nstandard.    But, says the Forest Service, the one reference to the\n\n2005 rules was missed in the clean-up.\n\n            This is hardly the \"post hoc rationalization\" claimed by\n\nSierra Club, see NRDC v. U.S. Envtl. Prot. Agency, 824 F.2d 1258,\n\n1286 n.19 (1st Cir. 1987), since the agency itself identified the\n\ntypographical error as such in denying Sierra Club's administrative\n\nappeal and the explanation is therefore part of the administrative\n\nrecord.     Nor does Sierra Club provide any reason to doubt the\n\nForest Service's explanation.       So the citation may fairly be\n\ntreated as a typographical error; but this is not automatically\n\ndispositive.\n\n            Had the revised draft Than EA relied on the 2005 rules in\n\nany way critical to the outcome, Sierra Club might well have an\n\nargument--regardless of missed citations--that the Than Project EA\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fcould not be saved by an overnight mechanical deletion of specific\n\nreferences. But whatever weakening attended the 2005 rules, Sierra\n\nClub has not shown that those rules were pertinently less demanding\n\nthan the 2000 rule's \"best available science\" standard.       Instead,\n\nthe distinctions it draws are between the 1982 rules and the 2000\n\nrules, which is not the relevant comparison.\n\n          Sierra Club also contends that because the 2005 rules\n\nwere enjoined by a district court, the 1982 rules went back into\n\neffect.   Had we in fact found that the 2000 rules did not apply,\n\nthis argument would have merit.    See Action on Smoking & Health,\n\n713 F.2d at 797 (holding that where one agency rule is invalidated\n\nthe previous rule in force applies).    However, because we hold the\n\nbest available science standard applied, that portion of the 2000\n\nrules went back into effect when the 2005 rules were enjoined.\n\n          Sierra Club next says that the EAs were inconsistent in\n\nidentifying which rules governed and did not explicitly use the\n\n\"best available science\" standard on which the Forest Service now\n\nrelies.   Sierra   Club's   argument   rests   heavily   on the Second\n\nCircuit's opinion in Forest Watch v. U.S. Forest Service, 410 F.3d\n\n115, 119 (2d Cir. 2005), which held that Forest Service's failure\n\nto \"consider or mention the 'best available science' standard\" in\n\nimplementing two site-specific projects amounted to conduct that\n\nwas arbitrary and capricious.\n\n\n\n\n                                -13-\n\f          In fact, the Batchelder EA did refer to the best evidence\n\nstandard, the Forest Service says that the Than EA complied with it\n\nin substance and the FONSIs for the projects state the Forest\n\nService relied on the \"best available science\"--all consistent with\n\nthe Forest Service's view of the 2000 transition provision.     By\n\ncontrast, in Forest Watch, the EAs and the FONSIs made no reference\n\nto \"best available science\" and, more significant, there were\n\nrepeated citations to the 1982 rules.    Forest Watch, 410 F.3d at\n\n119.\n\n          On top of all this, it is not clear why references to\n\n\"best available science\" matter: unlike Forest Watch, there is no\n\nindication here that the Forest Service invoked the 1982 rules,\n\nallegedly misapplied them and is now claiming that it used the\n\nnewer standard instead.   Of course, Sierra Club could point us to\n\nsome specific substantive dispute and then argue the science relied\n\nupon by the agency was not \"the best.\"   But Sierra Club identifies\n\nno such controversy in this case.\n\n          Sierra Club next argues that even if the 1982 rules did\n\nnot apply to the Than and Batchelder projects by their own force,\n\nthey apply because the Forest Service chose to revise the 2005\n\nForest Plan so as to incorporate the 1982 rules for future site-\n\nspecific projects.   The Forest Service agrees that the conclusion\n\nwould follow if the premise were correct, see Troyer, 479 F.3d at\n\n\n\n\n                               -14-\n\f1282; but it denies that the 2005 Plan adopted the 1982 rules as\n\nrequirements for subsequent projects like Than and Batchelder.\n\n             The district court found that the 2005 Plan did not\n\n\"specifically incorporate\" the 1982 rules and so they did not apply\n\nunder   an   \"adoption\"   theory   to   the   Than   and   Batchelder   Brook\n\nprojects.     Wagner, 2008 WL 4560669, at *11.         The 2005 Plan does\n\nrefer to the 1982 rules on several different occasions, notably\n\nseveral references to \"MIS Monitoring.\" But the 2005 Plan does not\n\nsay that the 1982 rules govern plan projects; in fact, it states\n\nthat \"[t]he regulations do not require MIS monitoring on every\n\nproject.\"\n\n             In addition to its \"wrong rules\" arguments, Sierra Club\n\nobjects to the Forest Service's substantive finding that the Than\n\nand Batchelder projects would have no significant impact on the\n\nenvironment.     This is an argument that one might think could have\n\npromise because the two projects are not trivial and the Forest\n\nService itself conceded that there would be some negative effects.\n\nBut Sierra Club's own arguments do not seriously undermine the\n\nFONSI findings.\n\n             A substantive attack on an impact assessment is not easy.\n\nThe Council on Environmental Quality (\"CEQ\") and case law standards\n\nfor \"significance\" are (perhaps inevitably) general, and courts\n\nhave good reason to take seriously the deference due to the agency\n\nin technical and scientific matters.          Kleppe v. Sierra Club, 427\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\fU.S. 390, 410 n.21 (1976); see also Sierra Club v. Marsh, 769 F.2d\n\n868, 871 (1st Cir. 1985) (Breyer, J.).   Ordinarily, the attack has\n\nto start by explaining just what harms might result and make, in\n\nthe Third Circuit's words,\n\n          at least some effort . . . to advance specific\n          allegations    that   the   agency   .   .   .\n          misinterpreted    the   evidence,   overlooked\n          certain testimony, or unreasonably reached its\n          'no significant impact determination.'\n\nLower Alloways Creek Twp. v. Pub. Serv. Elec. & Gas Co., 687 F.2d\n\n732, 747 (3d Cir. 1982).\n\n          The Forest is almost 800,000 acres and has a history of\n\nmixed uses included timber harvesting.    The Than Project involves\n\ntimber harvesting, subject to maximum amounts, on 929 acres, with\n\nclear cutting for new timber on up to 231 acres; Batchelder Brook\n\nProject involves harvesting on 380 acres; some of the harvesting in\n\neach case is in inventoried roadless areas. Than requires 500 feet\n\nof new road; Batchelder none.   On an order of magnitude basis these\n\ndo not seem like negligible enterprises but--without more--neither\n\nare they self-evidently \"significant\" in potential negative impact.\n\n          Yet Sierra Club makes only a single concrete point as to\n\nimmediate harm: it argues that harvesting, especially clear cutting\n\nfor new growths, creates visual scars visible even from outside the\n\narea; that the Forest Service concedes that the effects could\n\nendure for a decade or two; and that in California v. Block, 690\n\nF.2d 753, 763 (9th Cir. 1982), the court said that \"[t]he 'critical\n\n\n                                -16-\n\fdecision' to commit [roadless] areas for nonwilderness uses, at\n\nleast for the next ten to fifteen years, is 'irreversible and\n\nirretrievable.'\"\n\n              Block, very different from this case, involved a decision\n\nby the Forest Service to \"command that [certain roadless areas\n\nnationwide] be used for non-wilderness purposes\" without troubling\n\nto \"assess the wilderness value of each area [that would have been\n\nallocated] and to evaluate the impact of Nonwilderness designations\n\nupon each area's wilderness characteristics and value.\"                         Id. at\n\n764.     Here we have a narrow judgment that neither of the two\n\nprecisely     defined      projects   will     have   a    \"significant\"    adverse\n\neffect.\n\n              In estimating duration, the Forest Service was talking\n\nonly of the visual effect from clear-cutting, which diminishes over\n\ntime and a more complete version of its verdict is that the effects\n\n\"should not be noticeable to the untrained eye within a decade or\n\ntwo.\"     If so, the visual blight would begin to be dissipating\n\nalmost from the start. So, too, harvesting would disturb solitude;\n\nbut    this   would   be    primarily   limited       to   the   period    in    which\n\nharvesting was occurring.\n\n              It is perhaps more troubling that the Forest Service EAs\n\nalso conceded that there would or could be negative effects from\n\nsedimentation in waters due to erosion and other effects from\n\nlogging and that disturbances could harm both water and wildlife.\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\fStill, mitigating measures were promised and are relevant, e.g.,\n\nCabinet Mountains Wilderness/Scotchman's Peak Grizzly Bears v.\n\nPeterson, 685 F.2d 678, 682 (D.C. Cir. 1982), and Sierra Club's\n\nbrief makes no effort to develop an attack on their adequacy.\n\n            Sierra Club does argue that the Forest Service failed to\n\nconsider the impact the projects would have on so-called \"roadless\n\ncharacteristics,\" which are identified in the 2001 Roadless Area\n\nConservation Rule (\"Roadless Rule\"), 36 C.F.R. § 294.                    The Forest\n\nService    says,    without      any   answer   from    Sierra   Club,    that   the\n\nRoadless Rule does not apply to these projects.5                    Sierra Club\n\nconcedes    in     its   reply    brief   that    the    Roadless   Rule    merely\n\nidentifies concerns that the Forest Service must address.\n\n            The so-called roadless characteristics to which Sierra\n\nClub points are a catch-all list of potential concerns,6 and some\n\n\n     5\n      The Forest Service says that the Roadless Rule applies only\nto areas so designated at the time the new regime was established\nin November 2000 or before, 66 Fed. Reg. at 3272, and that the IRAs\ninvolved in Than and Batchelder were not included.\n     6\n      They are as follows:\n     (1) high quality or undisturbed soil, water, and air;\n     (2) sources of public drinking water;\n     (3) diversity of plant and animal communities;\n     (4) habitat for threatened, endangered, proposed, candidate,\n     and sensitive species and for those species dependent on\n     large, undisturbed areas of land;\n     (5) primitive, semi-primitive nonmotorized and semi-primitive\n     motorized classes of dispersed recreation;\n     (6) reference landscapes;\n     (7) natural appearing landscapes with high scenic quality;\n     (8) traditional cultural properties and sacred sites; and\n     (9) other locally identified unique characteristics.\n\n\n                                        -18-\n\fwere certainly considered (soil and water quality, appearance)\n\nwhile others (e.g., sacred sites) are not even alleged to be of\n\nissue.         It   is   up     to    Sierra    Club     to   identify      important\n\nconsiderations that were presented by the record but were not\n\nseriously addressed in an EA.            The generality of the argument made\n\nrenders it ineffective.\n\n               Sierra Club next says that the Forest Service failed to\n\nconsider whether the timber harvesting would disqualify any of the\n\nland involved from future recommended designation for wilderness\n\nprotection that Congress may afford.                   The Forest Service fairly\n\nresponds that harvesting does not automatically preclude such a\n\ndesignation7 and that the South Carr Mountain area was considered\n\nfor    designation       despite     past     timber    harvesting    but    thought\n\nunsuitable for other reasons.\n\n               Further, the 2005 Plan (to whose analysis the Than and\n\nBatchelder      projects      were    tiered)   contains      even   more   specific\n\nanalysis, including explicit findings that the areas in question\n\nwere       inappropriate      for    future    wilderness     designation.       See\n\nHeartwood, Inc. v. U.S. Forest Serv., 380 F.3d 428, 433 (8th Cir.\n\n\n66 Fed. Reg. 3,244, 3272 (Jan. 12, 2001).\n       7\n      The Forest Service has recognized in its own handbook the\ndifference between Eastern and Western forests, with Eastern land\nwith up to 20 percent of a given area harvested for timber still\neligible for wilderness designation. FSH 1909.12 ch. 71.12 (2005).\nLand is eligible in the west for wilderness designation only in\n\"areas where logging and prior road construction are not evident.\"\nFSH 1909.12 ch. 71.1, 71.11 (2005).\n\n                                         -19-\n\f2004) (EA permissible when tiered to broader plan that did address\n\nimpact). And contrary to Sierra Club's assertion that wildlife was\n\nnot taken into consideration, the Forest Service explicitly looked\n\nat the impact on a host of species.\n\n            Independent of concrete harms from this project, Sierra\n\nClub makes a set of arguments that the projects are significant\n\nbecause of their \"context\" and ostensibly controversial nature.\n\nOne might be surprised to discover that even if a particular\n\nproject threatens no significant environmental harm, the decision\n\nto permit it may still be significant, depending on \"contextual\n\nfactors.\"    Yet, the regulations do suggest such a reading.     40\n\nC.F.R. § 1508.27 (2008).    Sierra Club argues that the Forest\n\nService failed to consider that \"these projects are the first to\n\nauthorize commercial logging and road building in an IRA in the\n\neastern United States and the first to enter a roadless area under\n\nthe 'Forest Plan IRAs' theory, since promulgation of the Roadless\n\nRule.\"   However, such a broad definition of context is explicitly\n\ndisclaimed by the relevant regulation, which states that the\n\nrelevant context for \"site specific action[s] . . . would usually\n\ndepend upon the effects in the locale rather than in the world as\n\na whole.\"   40 C.F.R. § 1508.27 (2008).\n\n            Its other argument is that the effects of the projects\n\nwere \"controversial,\" requiring the completion of an EIS. But once\n\nagain, the highly general character of this claim deprives it of\n\n\n                                -20-\n\fforce.   We are not told where the controversy lies, or even amongst\n\nwhom there is a meaningful dispute.            As best we can tell, the\n\ncontroversy is that the Sierra Club disagrees with the conclusions\n\nthe Forest Service reaches, which is not sufficient by itself to\n\nwarrant an EIS.      Cf. Native Ecosystems Council v. United States\n\nForest Serv., 428 F.3d 1233, 1240 (9th Cir. 2005).\n\n            The Forest Service did no EIS but also did not brush off\n\nenvironmental concerns.      Its EAs that are lengthy by any standard\n\n(appendices aside, the Than EA is 194 pages and the Batchelder EA\n\nis 146 pages) addressing in detail the environmental concerns that\n\nmight    arise   before   concluding   that,   as   subject   to   intended\n\nmitigation, the impacts were not significant.            The substantive\n\ndecisions thus did not ignore the possible environmental effects.\n\n            The Forest Service's EA discussion makes clear that it\n\nconsidered all of the arguable categories of harm--such as visual\n\neffects, noise, soil effects, impact on wildlife, road and bridge\n\nconstruction or maintenance, and impact on watershed--and that it\n\naddressed and answered claims concerning precedential significance,\n\nimpact on wilderness designation and the impact of the roadless\n\nrule.    Possibly little was saved by doing EAs of this character\n\ninstead of EISs, but it is not clear that anything was lost.\n\n            Sierra Club ends with a procedural argument that the\n\nForest Service violated NEPA by not making the FONSIs available\n\nfor thirty days of notice and comment.          CEQ regulations require\n\n\n                                  -21-\n\fthat draft FONSIs be made available for public review and comment,\n\ninter alia, when \"[t]he proposed action is, or is closely similar\n\nto,   one     which   normally   requires   the   preparation   of   an\n\nenvironmental impact statement.\"         40 C.F.R. § 1501.4(e)(2)(i)\n\n(2008).     Sierra Club says that the projects here meet the test for\n\nsuch notice.\n\n             Whether or not this is so, the evident intent to allow\n\npublic comment on FONSI findings seems to have been satisfied here\n\nin spades.     An agency that adopts a FONSI without seeking input\n\ncan be expected at least to accept comments before acting on the\n\nmerits of a decision; but here both EAs were circulated in draft\n\nform and comments solicited even before any FONSI was finally\n\nadopted.     Why this does not satisfy the purpose of the thirty day\n\nrule Sierra Club does not explain.\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -22-\n\f",

The governing White Mountain\n\nNational Forest Land and Resource Management Plan was most recently\n\nrevised and adopted in September 2005 (\"the 2005 Plan\").               The 2005\n\nPlan was revised pursuant to the 1982 forest service regulations\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f(\"the 1982 rules\"), which could still permissibly be considered for\n\nPlan revisions when the new plan was adopted.

The governing\n\n2005       Plan   promotes   multiple    uses    for   the   Forest   including\n\nrecreation, timber harvesting, and preservation of wildlife and\n\nwilderness, as required by the NFMA.             16 U.S.C. §§ 1604(a), (e).\n\nThe 2005 Plan classifies approximately 281,000 acres in the WMNF as\n\nappropriate for harvesting timber, but currently harvesting is\n\nallowed only on roughly 3,400 acres annually, a tiny fraction of\n\nthe forest.\n\n               During the 2005 Plan revision process, the land was\n\ninventoried to determine whether it qualified as \"roadless.\"                  36\n\nC.F.R. § 219.17(a) (1983).

The Forest Service\n\nrecommended that Congress so designate 34,500 acres over and above\n\nthe 114,000 acres previously protected.\n\n           After adoption of the 2005 Plan, the Forest Service\n\nevaluated various management areas within the Forest to determine\n\nwhat new projects were required to achieve the 2005 Plan goals.                   It\n\ndetermined, for the areas encompassing the Than and Batchelder\n\nprojects, that more diverse habitats, including new vegetation in\n\nyounger age classes, were needed and that it would be beneficial to\n\nharvest   some      mature   trees   to    create     room    for    younger    trees\n\n(creating what is known as early successional habitat).\n\n           Ultimately the Forest Service proposed to allow timber\n\nharvesting     of    approximately      929   acres    in     the    Than    project,\n\ncreating up to 231 acres of early successional habitat.                         Some\n\nexisting roads would receive maintenance or reconstruction, and a\n\n500 foot section of new road was planned.                   Part of this project\n\nwould affect the Wild River Inventoried Roadless Area, including\n\n464 acres of timber harvesting in that area.\n\n           The      other    proposed     action,   the      Batchelder      Project,\n\ninvolved harvesting on 380 acres, including 139 acres within the\n\nSouth   Carr   Mountain      Inventoried      Roadless       Area.     The    Project\n\nrequires no new road construction, but does authorize maintenance\n\non approximately three miles of road, one-half mile of which is\n\nlocated in the South Carr Mountain IRA.\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\f            The National Environmental Policy Act (\"NEPA\"), 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 4321 et seq., obligates agencies such as the Forest Service to\n\nevaluate the environmental impacts of its proposed actions.

One might think from the name\n\nthat \"best available science\" is an unexceptionable standard, but\n\naccording to Sierra Club, the 1982 rules provided a set of precise\n\ntests for evaluating a project's impact on species that are more\n\nrigorous and were intentionally weakened by the 2000 rules.\n\n          Its brief provides a short description of the difference\n\nand, as the characterization is not denied by the Forest Service's\n\nbrief, we will assume it to be true.

However, Sierra\n\nClub's brief fails to explain whether or how the allegedly more\n\nrigorous standards of the 1982 rules would likely have altered the\n\nForest Service's ultimate evaluation of the two projects. This may\n\nnot derail the argument but it reduces one's enthusiasm for it.\n\n          In all events, Sierra Club contends that the 1982 rules\n\napply in this case, and understanding the argument requires a brief\n\nexcursion.   When the new 2000 NFMA rules were announced, their\n\n\n                               -8-\n\ftransition provision deferred many of the new rules until November\n\n2003 (a date thereafter extended)2; but the provision said that\n\neffective immediately the Forest Service \"must consider the best\n\navailable science in implementing . . . the current plan.\"                  36\n\nC.F.R. § 219.35(a).       The parties take this language to supercede\n\nthe allegedly more stringent 1982 rules on species evaluation, but\n\ndisagree as to whether the transition provision covers the two\n\nprojects in issue here.\n\n          Sierra    Club    argues   that   the    plain   language   of   the\n\ntransition    provision    applies   only   to    forest   plans   that    were\n\n\"current\" when the transition provision was adopted in 2000.

And, the argument goes, the 2005 Plan for the forest\n\n(which had been implemented when the two projects were approved)\n\nwas not \"current\" in 2000.

Below, the Forest Service disclaimed this\n\nreference as a typographical error--and the district court agreed.\n\n            It appears that when the revised draft Than EA was\n\npublished for public comment in 2006, the 2005 rules had been\n\nadopted as a rewriting of the long deferred 2000 rules.     Once the\n\ninjunction against the 2005 rules issued, the Forest Service\n\nremoved almost all of the references in the draft to the 2005 rules\n\nand issued the final Than Project EA shortly thereafter, relying\n\ninstead on the 2000 transition provision's \"best available science\"\n\nstandard.    But, says the Forest Service, the one reference to the\n\n2005 rules was missed in the clean-up.\n\n            This is hardly the \"post hoc rationalization\" claimed by\n\nSierra Club, see NRDC v.

Nor does Sierra Club provide any reason to doubt the\n\nForest Service's explanation.       So the citation may fairly be\n\ntreated as a typographical error; but this is not automatically\n\ndispositive.\n\n            Had the revised draft Than EA relied on the 2005 rules in\n\nany way critical to the outcome, Sierra Club might well have an\n\nargument--regardless of missed citations--that the Than Project EA\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fcould not be saved by an overnight mechanical deletion of specific\n\nreferences. But whatever weakening attended the 2005 rules, Sierra\n\nClub has not shown that those rules were pertinently less demanding\n\nthan the 2000 rule's \"best available science\" standard.       Instead,\n\nthe distinctions it draws are between the 1982 rules and the 2000\n\nrules, which is not the relevant comparison.\n\n          Sierra Club also contends that because the 2005 rules\n\nwere enjoined by a district court, the 1982 rules went back into\n\neffect.   Had we in fact found that the 2000 rules did not apply,\n\nthis argument would have merit.    See Action on Smoking & Health,\n\n713 F.2d at 797 (holding that where one agency rule is invalidated\n\nthe previous rule in force applies).    However, because we hold the\n\nbest available science standard applied, that portion of the 2000\n\nrules went back into effect when the 2005 rules were enjoined.\n\n          Sierra Club next says that the EAs were inconsistent in\n\nidentifying which rules governed and did not explicitly use the\n\n\"best available science\" standard on which the Forest Service now\n\nrelies.   Sierra   Club's   argument   rests   heavily   on the Second\n\nCircuit's opinion in Forest Watch v. U.S. Forest Service, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790481\"><a href=\"/opinion/790481/forest-watch-forest-conservation-council-friends-of-the-earth-v-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">115</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 119 (2d Cir. 2005), which held that Forest Service's failure\n\nto \"consider or mention the 'best available science' standard\" in\n\nimplementing two site-specific projects amounted to conduct that\n\nwas arbitrary and capricious.\n\n\n\n\n                                -13-\n\f          In fact, the Batchelder EA did refer to the best evidence\n\nstandard, the Forest Service says that the Than EA complied with it\n\nin substance and the FONSIs for the projects state the Forest\n\nService relied on the \"best available science\"--all consistent with\n\nthe Forest Service's view of the 2000 transition provision.     By\n\ncontrast, in Forest Watch, the EAs and the FONSIs made no reference\n\nto \"best available science\" and, more significant, there were\n\nrepeated citations to the 1982 rules.    Forest Watch, 410 F.3d at\n\n119.\n\n          On top of all this, it is not clear why references to\n\n\"best available science\" matter: unlike Forest Watch, there is no\n\nindication here that the Forest Service invoked the 1982 rules,\n\nallegedly misapplied them and is now claiming that it used the\n\nnewer standard instead.   Of course, Sierra Club could point us to\n\nsome specific substantive dispute and then argue the science relied\n\nupon by the agency was not \"the best.\"   But Sierra Club identifies\n\nno such controversy in this case.\n\n          Sierra Club next argues that even if the 1982 rules did\n\nnot apply to the Than and Batchelder projects by their own force,\n\nthey apply because the Forest Service chose to revise the 2005\n\nForest Plan so as to incorporate the 1982 rules for future site-\n\nspecific projects.   The Forest Service agrees that the conclusion\n\nwould follow if the premise were correct, see Troyer, 479 F.3d at\n\n\n\n\n                               -14-\n\f1282; but it denies that the 2005 Plan adopted the 1982 rules as\n\nrequirements for subsequent projects like Than and Batchelder.\n\n             The district court found that the 2005 Plan did not\n\n\"specifically incorporate\" the 1982 rules and so they did not apply\n\nunder   an   \"adoption\"   theory   to   the   Than   and   Batchelder   Brook\n\nprojects.

The 2005 Plan does\n\nrefer to the 1982 rules on several different occasions, notably\n\nseveral references to \"MIS Monitoring.\" But the 2005 Plan does not\n\nsay that the 1982 rules govern plan projects; in fact, it states\n\nthat \"[t]he regulations do not require MIS monitoring on every\n\nproject.\"\n\n             In addition to its \"wrong rules\" arguments, Sierra Club\n\nobjects to the Forest Service's substantive finding that the Than\n\nand Batchelder projects would have no significant impact on the\n\nenvironment.     This is an argument that one might think could have\n\npromise because the two projects are not trivial and the Forest\n\nService itself conceded that there would be some negative effects.\n\nBut Sierra Club's own arguments do not seriously undermine the\n\nFONSI findings.\n\n             A substantive attack on an impact assessment is not easy.\n\nThe Council on Environmental Quality (\"CEQ\") and case law standards\n\nfor \"significance\" are (perhaps inevitably) general, and courts\n\nhave good reason to take seriously the deference due to the agency\n\nin technical and scientific matters.

The Than Project involves\n\ntimber harvesting, subject to maximum amounts, on 929 acres, with\n\nclear cutting for new timber on up to 231 acres; Batchelder Brook\n\nProject involves harvesting on 380 acres; some of the harvesting in\n\neach case is in inventoried roadless areas. Than requires 500 feet\n\nof new road; Batchelder none.   On an order of magnitude basis these\n\ndo not seem like negligible enterprises but--without more--neither\n\nare they self-evidently \"significant\" in potential negative impact.\n\n          Yet Sierra Club makes only a single concrete point as to\n\nimmediate harm: it argues that harvesting, especially clear cutting\n\nfor new growths, creates visual scars visible even from outside the\n\narea; that the Forest Service concedes that the effects could\n\nendure for a decade or two; and that in California v. Block, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"409483\"><a href=\"/opinion/409483/state-of-california-v-john-r-block-in-his-official-capacity-as/\"><span class=\"volume\">690</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">753</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 763 (9th Cir. 1982), the court said that \"[t]he 'critical\n\n\n                                -16-\n\fdecision' to commit [roadless] areas for nonwilderness uses, at\n\nleast for the next ten to fifteen years, is 'irreversible and\n\nirretrievable.'\"\n\n              Block, very different from this case, involved a decision\n\nby the Forest Service to \"command that [certain roadless areas\n\nnationwide] be used for non-wilderness purposes\" without troubling\n\nto \"assess the wilderness value of each area [that would have been\n\nallocated] and to evaluate the impact of Nonwilderness designations\n\nupon each area's wilderness characteristics and value.\"                         Id. at\n\n764.     Here we have a narrow judgment that neither of the two\n\nprecisely     defined      projects   will     have   a    \"significant\"    adverse\n\neffect.\n\n              In estimating duration, the Forest Service was talking\n\nonly of the visual effect from clear-cutting, which diminishes over\n\ntime and a more complete version of its verdict is that the effects\n\n\"should not be noticeable to the untrained eye within a decade or\n\ntwo.\"     If so, the visual blight would begin to be dissipating\n\nalmost from the start. So, too, harvesting would disturb solitude;\n\nbut    this   would   be    primarily   limited       to   the   period    in    which\n\nharvesting was occurring.\n\n              It is perhaps more troubling that the Forest Service EAs\n\nalso conceded that there would or could be negative effects from\n\nsedimentation in waters due to erosion and other effects from\n\nlogging and that disturbances could harm both water and wildlife.\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\fStill, mitigating measures were promised and are relevant, e.g.,\n\nCabinet Mountains Wilderness/Scotchman's Peak Grizzly Bears v.\n\nPeterson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"407571\"><a href=\"/opinion/407571/cabinet-mountains-wildernessscotchmans-peak-grizzly-bears-v-r-max/\"><span class=\"volume\">685</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">678</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 682 (D.C.

The Forest\n\nService    says,    without      any   answer   from    Sierra   Club,    that   the\n\nRoadless Rule does not apply to these projects.5                    Sierra Club\n\nconcedes    in     its   reply    brief   that    the    Roadless   Rule    merely\n\nidentifies concerns that the Forest Service must address.\n\n            The so-called roadless characteristics to which Sierra\n\nClub points are a catch-all list of potential concerns,6 and some\n\n\n     5\n      The Forest Service says that the Roadless Rule applies only\nto areas so designated at the time the new regime was established\nin November 2000 or before, 66 Fed. Reg. at 3272, and that the IRAs\ninvolved in Than and Batchelder were not included.\n     6\n      They are as follows:\n     (1) high quality or undisturbed soil, water, and air;\n     (2) sources of public drinking water;\n     (3) diversity of plant and animal communities;\n     (4) habitat for threatened, endangered, proposed, candidate,\n     and sensitive species and for those species dependent on\n     large, undisturbed areas of land;\n     (5) primitive, semi-primitive nonmotorized and semi-primitive\n     motorized classes of dispersed recreation;\n     (6) reference landscapes;\n     (7) natural appearing landscapes with high scenic quality;\n     (8) traditional cultural properties and sacred sites; and\n     (9) other locally identified unique characteristics.\n\n\n                                        -18-\n\fwere certainly considered (soil and water quality, appearance)\n\nwhile others (e.g., sacred sites) are not even alleged to be of\n\nissue.         It   is   up     to    Sierra    Club     to   identify      important\n\nconsiderations that were presented by the record but were not\n\nseriously addressed in an EA.            The generality of the argument made\n\nrenders it ineffective.\n\n               Sierra Club next says that the Forest Service failed to\n\nconsider whether the timber harvesting would disqualify any of the\n\nland involved from future recommended designation for wilderness\n\nprotection that Congress may afford.                   The Forest Service fairly\n\nresponds that harvesting does not automatically preclude such a\n\ndesignation7 and that the South Carr Mountain area was considered\n\nfor    designation       despite     past     timber    harvesting    but    thought\n\nunsuitable for other reasons.\n\n               Further, the 2005 Plan (to whose analysis the Than and\n\nBatchelder      projects      were    tiered)   contains      even   more   specific\n\nanalysis, including explicit findings that the areas in question\n\nwere       inappropriate      for    future    wilderness     designation.

Reg. 3,244, 3272 (Jan. 12, 2001).\n       7\n      The Forest Service has recognized in its own handbook the\ndifference between Eastern and Western forests, with Eastern land\nwith up to 20 percent of a given area harvested for timber still\neligible for wilderness designation. FSH 1909.12 ch. 71.12 (2005).\nLand is eligible in the west for wilderness designation only in\n\"areas where logging and prior road construction are not evident.\"\nFSH 1909.12 ch. 71.1, 71.11 (2005).\n\n                                         -19-\n\f2004) (EA permissible when tiered to broader plan that did address\n\nimpact). And contrary to Sierra Club's assertion that wildlife was\n\nnot taken into consideration, the Forest Service explicitly looked\n\nat the impact on a host of species.\n\n            Independent of concrete harms from this project, Sierra\n\nClub makes a set of arguments that the projects are significant\n\nbecause of their \"context\" and ostensibly controversial nature.\n\nOne might be surprised to discover that even if a particular\n\nproject threatens no significant environmental harm, the decision\n\nto permit it may still be significant, depending on \"contextual\n\nfactors.\"    Yet, the regulations do suggest such a reading.     40\n\nC.F.R. § 1508.27 (2008).    Sierra Club argues that the Forest\n\nService failed to consider that \"these projects are the first to\n\nauthorize commercial logging and road building in an IRA in the\n\neastern United States and the first to enter a roadless area under\n\nthe 'Forest Plan IRAs' theory, since promulgation of the Roadless\n\nRule.\"   However, such a broad definition of context is explicitly\n\ndisclaimed by the relevant regulation, which states that the\n\nrelevant context for \"site specific action[s] . . . would usually\n\ndepend upon the effects in the locale rather than in the world as\n\na whole.\"   40 C.F.R. § 1508.27 (2008).\n\n            Its other argument is that the effects of the projects\n\nwere \"controversial,\" requiring the completion of an EIS. But once\n\nagain, the highly general character of this claim deprives it of\n\n\n                                -20-\n\fforce.   We are not told where the controversy lies, or even amongst\n\nwhom there is a meaningful dispute.            As best we can tell, the\n\ncontroversy is that the Sierra Club disagrees with the conclusions\n\nthe Forest Service reaches, which is not sufficient by itself to\n\nwarrant an EIS.      Cf. Native Ecosystems Council v. United States\n\nForest Serv., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792432\"><a href=\"/opinion/792432/native-ecosystems-council-v-united-states-forest-service-an-agency-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1233</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1240 (9th Cir. 2005).\n\n            The Forest Service did no EIS but also did not brush off\n\nenvironmental concerns.      Its EAs that are lengthy by any standard\n\n(appendices aside, the Than EA is 194 pages and the Batchelder EA\n\nis 146 pages) addressing in detail the environmental concerns that\n\nmight    arise   before   concluding   that,   as   subject   to   intended\n\nmitigation, the impacts were not significant.            The substantive\n\ndecisions thus did not ignore the possible environmental effects.\n\n            The Forest Service's EA discussion makes clear that it\n\nconsidered all of the arguable categories of harm--such as visual\n\neffects, noise, soil effects, impact on wildlife, road and bridge\n\nconstruction or maintenance, and impact on watershed--and that it\n\naddressed and answered claims concerning precedential significance,\n\nimpact on wilderness designation and the impact of the roadless\n\nrule.    Possibly little was saved by doing EAs of this character\n\ninstead of EISs, but it is not clear that anything was lost.\n\n            Sierra Club ends with a procedural argument that the\n\nForest Service violated NEPA by not making the FONSIs available\n\nfor thirty days of notice and comment.          CEQ regulations require\n\n\n                                  -21-\n\fthat draft FONSIs be made available for public review and comment,\n\ninter alia, when \"[t]he proposed action is, or is closely similar\n\nto,   one     which   normally   requires   the   preparation   of   an\n\nenvironmental impact statement.\"         40 C.F.R. § 1501.4(e)(2)(i)\n\n(2008).     Sierra Club says that the projects here meet the test for\n\nsuch notice.\n\n             Whether or not this is so, the evident intent to allow\n\npublic comment on FONSI findings seems to have been satisfied here\n\nin spades.     An agency that adopts a FONSI without seeking input\n\ncan be expected at least to accept comments before acting on the\n\nmerits of a decision; but here both EAs were circulated in draft\n\nform and comments solicited even before any FONSI was finally\n\nadopted.     Why this does not satisfy the purpose of the thirty day\n\nrule Sierra Club does not explain.\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -22-\n\f</pre>",
