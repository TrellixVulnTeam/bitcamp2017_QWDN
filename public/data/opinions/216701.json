Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the\nSupreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.\n\f     SOUTER, Associate Justice.         This is a declaratory judgment\n\naction to determine coverage under a commercial policy insuring\n\nagainst liability for injury caused by advertising.         The plaintiff\n\nCynosure, Inc., is the defendant in an underlying civil action\n\ncharging it with responsibility for sending commercial fax messages\n\n“without consent from the recipients” in violation of the Telephone\n\nConsumer Protection Act, 47 U.S.C. § 227(b)(1)(C).                Cynosure’s\n\ninsurers and the defendants here are St. Paul Fire and Marine\n\nInsurance Company and St. Paul Guardian Insurance Company, which we\n\nwill speak of singularly as “St. Paul.”               It denied that the\n\nrelevant policies’ coverage for “making known to any person or\n\norganization covered material that violates a person’s right of\n\nprivacy” extends to liability under the Act. It explained that the\n\npolicy language applied “where an insured makes known to others\n\ncovered   material   that   violates   some   other    person’s    right   of\n\nprivacy,” but not in the circumstances of the underlying action\n\nalleging that the recipient of a fax had thereby suffered injury to\n\nprivacy of his own.\n\n     This ensuing request for declaratory judgment joins a line of\n\ncases addressing whether policies insuring against liability for\n\nviolating privacy by advertising activity mean privacy understood\n\nas repose undisturbed by commercial intrusion (and thus liability\n\nfor violating the Act), or privacy as freedom from disclosure to a\n\nthird-party recipient of information that the subject of the\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fdisclosure claims an interest in not having divulged.             Compare\n\nSummit Loans, Inc. v. Pecola, 265 Md. 43, 288 A.2d 114 (1972)\n\n(hundreds of harassing phone calls violate the recipient’s right to\n\nprivacy), with Alberts v. Devine, 395 Mass. 59, 479 N.E.2d 113\n\n(1985)   (physician’s   disclosure   of   medical   information   gained\n\nthrough the professional relationship violates the patient’s right\n\nto privacy).   We hold that on a fair reading of these policies,\n\nthey refer to disclosure, not intrusion, so that liability for\n\nviolating the Act is not covered.1\n\n     There is no question that Massachusetts law governs in this\n\ndiversity action, and the district court rested its decision in\n\nfavor of coverage on the opinion of the Supreme Judicial Court of\n\nMassachusetts in Terra Nova Ins. Co. v. Fray-Witzer, 449 Mass. 406,\n\n869 N.E.2d 565 (2007).2   The policy construed in Terra Nova covered\n\nadvertising liability for “publication of material that violates a\n\nperson’s right of privacy.” Id. at 569.        The Court applied the\n\ncommon rule that ordinary, plain meaning governs the analysis of\n\ninsurance contract terms, along with the corollary that ambiguity\n\n\n\n     1\n     Summary judgment orders are reviewed de novo.          Fithian v.\nReed, 204 F.3d 306, 308 (1st Cir. 2000).\n     2\n     The substantive law applied in Terra Nova was actually that\nof New Jersey, which the parties stipulated was identical to the\nlaw of the Massachusetts forum.     Terra Nova Ins. Co. v. Fray-\nWitzer, 449 Mass. 406, 869 N.E.2d 565, 570 (2007). While the Court\ndid not expressly approve that stipulation, the interpretive\nprinciples applied leave no doubt that the analysis does represent\nMassachusetts law.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fin the language as it would be understood by an ordinary insured is\n\nconstrued in favor of coverage.           Id. at 571-72.    Because it found\n\n“the    term   ‘right     of   privacy’    to   be   ambiguous     [as   to   the\n\nalternatives     of     intrusion   and    disclosure]     in    the   insurers’\n\npolicies,” id. at 573, it held that liability for violating the Act\n\nwas covered.\n\n       It is not that the district court thought that the particular\n\nresult reached in applying the Massachusetts interpretive rules in\n\nTerra Nova necessarily governed the result in a case like this.\n\nFinding ambiguity in “publication of material that violates a\n\nperson’s right of privacy” does not imply the same conclusion about\n\n“making known to any person or organization covered material that\n\nviolates a person’s right of privacy,” and the Massachusetts Court\n\nwas careful to say that it found “right of privacy” ambiguous in\n\nthe policies then before it, not categorically.                 But neither did\n\nthe district court think that state law left the scope of the\n\nmaking-known term in limbo, for it saw a clue in Terra Nova’s\n\nfootnote 12: “Several courts have interpreted identical or similar\n\npolicy language to mean that unsolicited facsimile advertisements\n\nconstitute advertising injury.”             Id. at 574 n.12 (citations to\n\neight cases omitted, as are citations to four further cases, placed\n\nin a separate paragraph, that the Court noted as reaching “the\n\nopposite conclusion.”)         Although the footnote did not explain the\n\nscope of “similar policy language,” the district court understood\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fthe phrase to extend to a “making known” provision like the one\n\nhere.\n\n      Counsel for St. Paul, however, calls our attention to several\n\nother details of Terra Nova that point away from reading the\n\nfootnote as deciding this case.        Seven out of the eight cases in\n\nthe string citation following the reference to “identical or\n\nsimilar policy language” dealt with a “publication,” not a “making\n\nknown,” policy term. The remaining case involved a policy covering\n\n“invasions of rights of privacy” with no further definition of the\n\nterm.    See Universal Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Lou Fusz Auto.\n\nNetwork, Inc., 401 F.3d 876, 879 n.2, 882-83 (8th Cir. 2005).            And\n\nalthough three “making known” cases were included in the subsequent\n\ncitation of cases that “reached the opposite conclusion” from Terra\n\nNova, the placement of those cases in a separate footnote paragraph\n\nat   least   raises   a   question   whether   the    Massachusetts   Court\n\nunderstood    that    “making    known”    was   “similar”      enough    to\n\n“publication” to call for the same result.           In fact, if we go back\n\nprior to footnote 12 of the opinion, the Massachusetts Court\n\nprobably answered that question when it distinguished Resource\n\nBankshares Corp. v. St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co., 407 F.3d 631 (4th\n\nCir. 2005), as inapplicable because the policy at issue there “was\n\ndifferent from” the “publication” policies at issue in Terra Nova\n\n“inasmuch as it defined an ‘advertising injury’ as ‘[m]aking known\n\nto any person or organization written or spoken material that\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fviolates a person’s right of privacy.’”              Terra Nova, 869 N.E.2d at\n\n415 n.10.       We therefore think that the Terra Nova Court did not\n\nmean that the “making known” policies here would be treated as\n\nsimilar    to    “publication”       policies,    with    the   consequence       that\n\nMassachusetts law is a clean slate on our issue, and we are\n\nconsigned to making our own best guess about the state-law issue\n\nbased     on     the    familiar      principles     of     insurance       contract\n\ninterpretation that the Commonwealth follows.\n\n     The       first   of   those    principles    is    that   we   look    to    the\n\nparticulars of the very policy in issue, Allmerica Fin. Corp. v.\n\nCertain Underwriters at Lloyd’s, London, 449 Mass. 621, 871 N.E.2d\n\n418, 425 (2007) (“An insurance contract is to be interpreted\n\n‘according to the fair and reasonable meaning of the words in which\n\nthe agreement of the parties is expressed.’”) (quoting Cody v.\n\nConn. Gen. Life Ins. Co., 387 Mass. 142, 146 N.E.2d 234, 237\n\n(1982)), which requires us to dispense for a moment with the\n\nshorthand classifications of “publication” and “making known,” and\n\nexamine the whole provision at issue.              When we do, its remarkable\n\ndifferences from the clause at issue in Terra Nova include not only\n\nits description of advertising injury as occurring by making\n\ncertain material known, but its identification of the recipient of\n\nsuch material as “a person or organization.”                    By distinguishing\n\n“person” and “organization” and thus providing that a covered\n\nadvertising      injury     occurs   when   an    insured   makes    known    to    an\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\f“organization” some material that violates a “person’s” right of\n\nprivacy, the policy provision describes a communication to a\n\nrecipient (organization) that violates the right of a non-recipient\n\nthird party (person).    Since a mere intrusion into the recipient’s\n\nrepose does not violate any right of a non-recipient, in practical\n\nterms this means that the communication to the recipient violates\n\nthe non-recipient’s right of privacy only if it is a communication\n\nabout the non-recipient.    In order to give rise to tort liability\n\nfor violating the third party’s right of privacy, the material\n\ncommunicated must therefore reveal some fact the third party\n\nreasonably wishes to keep others from being told.          See Terra Nova,\n\n869 N.E.2d at 573 n.11 (“Black’s Law Dictionary 1350 (8th ed. 2004)\n\ndefines ‘right of privacy’ as ‘[t]he right to personal autonomy,’\n\nor ‘the right of a person and the person’s property to be free from\n\nunwarranted public scrutiny or exposure.’”).\n\n     Taking   this   interpretation    to   define   the   limits   of   the\n\ncoverage clauses is consistent with the straightforward meaning of\n\nrelated provisions in the St. Paul policies covering liability for\n\nother advertising offenses, those that involve libel or slander,\n\nmaking known material that disparages the products or work of\n\nothers, and unauthorized use of the advertising materials of\n\nothers; for each offense, the injury turns on the content of the\n\nmaterial communicated to a third party.              More significantly,\n\ntreating this analysis as definitive is, of course, congruent with\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fthe accepted definition of the verb phrase “make known,” which\n\nother courts have read as commonly meaning “telling, sharing or\n\notherwise divulging,” Resource Bankshares, 407 F.3d at 641.                  See\n\nalso Melrose Hotel Co. v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co., 432 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 488, 503 (E.D. Penn. 2006), aff’d, 503 F.3d 339 (3d Cir.\n\n2007) (“disclosure to a third party or divulging of a secret”).\n\nThe relative specificity of “making known” thus distinguishes it\n\nfrom the more general verb “publishing,” which can be used in\n\neither of two normal senses, to refer to revealing information or\n\nmerely to the act itself of conveying material considered apart\n\nfrom its content.      See Terra Nova, 869 N.E.2d at 572, 574.               The\n\nupshot is that in contrast to a “publication” provision, there is\n\nno apparent ambiguity in the provision considered here, describing\n\ncoverage   of     liability      for    making   known   to   one   person    or\n\norganization something about a third person.\n\n     What logic and definition require, syntax confirms.                On our\n\nreading,   the    content   of    the    material   communicated    (revealing\n\nsomething about a third party) is necessary for a covered violation\n\nof a right of privacy. Under Cynosure’s argument, on the contrary,\n\nmaking known alone (to the recipient) would violate privacy without\n\nregard to content.     That is, the modifying phrase “that violates a\n\nperson’s right of privacy” would refer to “making known,” not to\n\n“material.”      But to do that, the modifier would have to jump back\n\nover the words “to any person or organization covered material,”\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fand that would be not only a broad jump, but an unlikely one at\n\nall, since the phrase “that violates . . .” has an obvious\n\nantecedent in its contiguous neighbor, “covered material.”           While\n\nnot every commercial contract term may intend to respect this\n\nconvention of looking to the most direct antecedent as the subject\n\nof a modifier, the more complex a sentence is, the more likely it\n\nis that the most direct antecedent is the one that commercial\n\ncontracting parties understood.3\n\n     Aside from that, reading the modifier “that violates. . .” to\n\nrefer to “making known” would involve usage so awkward and so\n\nunusual as to make it too unlikely to be reasonable.         On Cynosure’s\n\nview, it would have to make sense to read the policy provision\n\nwithout the reference to covered material, that is, as covering\n\nliability for a “making known . . . that violates a person’s right\n\nof privacy.”     But that is not how we speak, and it would be\n\nbarbarous to talk or write that way.          Cynosure, in other words,\n\nasks us to read the provision as if it were written some other way,\n\nand that is just what the Terra Nova Court has told us the law of\n\nMassachusetts will not tolerate.        869 N.E.2d at 574.\n\n     In   sum,   we   believe   that   the   Supreme   Judicial   Court   of\n\n\n\n     3\n     Contrast the provision here with Terra Nova’s “publication of\nmaterial that violates a person’s right of privacy.” “[M]aterial”\nis again the closest probable antecedent, but “publication,”\nanother noun, is only two words back. It is not so clear that\n“publication” would not be fairly read as modified, even with\n“material” in between.\n\n                                   -9-\n\fMassachusetts would conclude that St. Paul’s language in these\n\n“making known” policies is not ambiguous, and that the person who\n\nwrote the coverage disclaimer got it right in a nutshell, by\n\nexplaining   that   the   policies’   advertising   liability   coverage\n\napplies only “where an insured makes known to others covered\n\nmaterial that violates some other person’s right of privacy.” Such\n\nis not the basis for liability incurred by sending faxes in\n\nviolation of § 227(b)(1)(C), as indeed we understand every case to\n\nhave held when dealing with making-known policy language like the\n\nprovisions here.4   St. Paul is entitled to judgment.\n\n     Reversed.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      Resource Bankshares Corp. v.

While the Court\ndid not expressly approve that stipulation, the interpretive\nprinciples applied leave no doubt that the analysis does represent\nMassachusetts law.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fin the language as it would be understood by an ordinary insured is\n\nconstrued in favor of coverage.           Id. at 571-72.    Because it found\n\n“the    term   ‘right     of   privacy’    to   be   ambiguous     [as   to   the\n\nalternatives     of     intrusion   and    disclosure]     in    the   insurers’\n\npolicies,” id. at 573, it held that liability for violating the Act\n\nwas covered.\n\n       It is not that the district court thought that the particular\n\nresult reached in applying the Massachusetts interpretive rules in\n\nTerra Nova necessarily governed the result in a case like this.\n\nFinding ambiguity in “publication of material that violates a\n\nperson’s right of privacy” does not imply the same conclusion about\n\n“making known to any person or organization covered material that\n\nviolates a person’s right of privacy,” and the Massachusetts Court\n\nwas careful to say that it found “right of privacy” ambiguous in\n\nthe policies then before it, not categorically.                 But neither did\n\nthe district court think that state law left the scope of the\n\nmaking-known term in limbo, for it saw a clue in Terra Nova’s\n\nfootnote 12: “Several courts have interpreted identical or similar\n\npolicy language to mean that unsolicited facsimile advertisements\n\nconstitute advertising injury.”             Id. at 574 n.12 (citations to\n\neight cases omitted, as are citations to four further cases, placed\n\nin a separate paragraph, that the Court noted as reaching “the\n\nopposite conclusion.”)         Although the footnote did not explain the\n\nscope of “similar policy language,” the district court understood\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fthe phrase to extend to a “making known” provision like the one\n\nhere.\n\n      Counsel for St. Paul, however, calls our attention to several\n\nother details of Terra Nova that point away from reading the\n\nfootnote as deciding this case.        Seven out of the eight cases in\n\nthe string citation following the reference to “identical or\n\nsimilar policy language” dealt with a “publication,” not a “making\n\nknown,” policy term. The remaining case involved a policy covering\n\n“invasions of rights of privacy” with no further definition of the\n\nterm.    See Universal Underwriters Ins. Co. v.

And\n\nalthough three “making known” cases were included in the subsequent\n\ncitation of cases that “reached the opposite conclusion” from Terra\n\nNova, the placement of those cases in a separate footnote paragraph\n\nat   least   raises   a   question   whether   the    Massachusetts   Court\n\nunderstood    that    “making    known”    was   “similar”      enough    to\n\n“publication” to call for the same result.

When we do, its remarkable\n\ndifferences from the clause at issue in Terra Nova include not only\n\nits description of advertising injury as occurring by making\n\ncertain material known, but its identification of the recipient of\n\nsuch material as “a person or organization.”                    By distinguishing\n\n“person” and “organization” and thus providing that a covered\n\nadvertising      injury     occurs   when   an    insured   makes    known    to    an\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\f“organization” some material that violates a “person’s” right of\n\nprivacy, the policy provision describes a communication to a\n\nrecipient (organization) that violates the right of a non-recipient\n\nthird party (person).    Since a mere intrusion into the recipient’s\n\nrepose does not violate any right of a non-recipient, in practical\n\nterms this means that the communication to the recipient violates\n\nthe non-recipient’s right of privacy only if it is a communication\n\nabout the non-recipient.    In order to give rise to tort liability\n\nfor violating the third party’s right of privacy, the material\n\ncommunicated must therefore reveal some fact the third party\n\nreasonably wishes to keep others from being told.          See Terra Nova,\n\n869 N.E.2d at 573 n.11 (“Black’s Law Dictionary 1350 (8th ed. 2004)\n\ndefines ‘right of privacy’ as ‘[t]he right to personal autonomy,’\n\nor ‘the right of a person and the person’s property to be free from\n\nunwarranted public scrutiny or exposure.’”).\n\n     Taking   this   interpretation    to   define   the   limits   of   the\n\ncoverage clauses is consistent with the straightforward meaning of\n\nrelated provisions in the St. Paul policies covering liability for\n\nother advertising offenses, those that involve libel or slander,\n\nmaking known material that disparages the products or work of\n\nothers, and unauthorized use of the advertising materials of\n\nothers; for each offense, the injury turns on the content of the\n\nmaterial communicated to a third party.              More significantly,\n\ntreating this analysis as definitive is, of course, congruent with\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fthe accepted definition of the verb phrase “make known,” which\n\nother courts have read as commonly meaning “telling, sharing or\n\notherwise divulging,” Resource Bankshares, 407 F.3d at 641.                  See\n\nalso Melrose Hotel Co. v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co., 432 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 488, 503 (E.D. Penn. 2006), aff’d, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">339</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir.\n\n2007) (“disclosure to a third party or divulging of a secret”).\n\nThe relative specificity of “making known” thus distinguishes it\n\nfrom the more general verb “publishing,” which can be used in\n\neither of two normal senses, to refer to revealing information or\n\nmerely to the act itself of conveying material considered apart\n\nfrom its content.      See Terra Nova, 869 N.E.2d at 572, 574.               The\n\nupshot is that in contrast to a “publication” provision, there is\n\nno apparent ambiguity in the provision considered here, describing\n\ncoverage   of     liability      for    making   known   to   one   person    or\n\norganization something about a third person.\n\n     What logic and definition require, syntax confirms.                On our\n\nreading,   the    content   of    the    material   communicated    (revealing\n\nsomething about a third party) is necessary for a covered violation\n\nof a right of privacy. Under Cynosure’s argument, on the contrary,\n\nmaking known alone (to the recipient) would violate privacy without\n\nregard to content.     That is, the modifying phrase “that violates a\n\nperson’s right of privacy” would refer to “making known,” not to\n\n“material.”      But to do that, the modifier would have to jump back\n\nover the words “to any person or organization covered material,”\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fand that would be not only a broad jump, but an unlikely one at\n\nall, since the phrase “that violates . . .” has an obvious\n\nantecedent in its contiguous neighbor, “covered material.”           While\n\nnot every commercial contract term may intend to respect this\n\nconvention of looking to the most direct antecedent as the subject\n\nof a modifier, the more complex a sentence is, the more likely it\n\nis that the most direct antecedent is the one that commercial\n\ncontracting parties understood.3\n\n     Aside from that, reading the modifier “that violates. . .” to\n\nrefer to “making known” would involve usage so awkward and so\n\nunusual as to make it too unlikely to be reasonable.         On Cynosure’s\n\nview, it would have to make sense to read the policy provision\n\nwithout the reference to covered material, that is, as covering\n\nliability for a “making known . . . that violates a person’s right\n\nof privacy.”     But that is not how we speak, and it would be\n\nbarbarous to talk or write that way.          Cynosure, in other words,\n\nasks us to read the provision as if it were written some other way,\n\nand that is just what the Terra Nova Court has told us the law of\n\nMassachusetts will not tolerate.        869 N.E.2d at 574.\n\n     In   sum,   we   believe   that   the   Supreme   Judicial   Court   of\n\n\n\n     3\n     Contrast the provision here with Terra Nova’s “publication of\nmaterial that violates a person’s right of privacy.” “[M]aterial”\nis again the closest probable antecedent, but “publication,”\nanother noun, is only two words back. It is not so clear that\n“publication” would not be fairly read as modified, even with\n“material” in between.\n\n                                   -9-\n\fMassachusetts would conclude that St. Paul’s language in these\n\n“making known” policies is not ambiguous, and that the person who\n\nwrote the coverage disclaimer got it right in a nutshell, by\n\nexplaining   that   the   policies’   advertising   liability   coverage\n\napplies only “where an insured makes known to others covered\n\nmaterial that violates some other person’s right of privacy.” Such\n\nis not the basis for liability incurred by sending faxes in\n\nviolation of § 227(b)(1)(C), as indeed we understand every case to\n\nhave held when dealing with making-known policy language like the\n\nprovisions here.4   St. Paul is entitled to judgment.\n\n     Reversed.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      Resource Bankshares Corp. v.
