Douglas P. Woodlock, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n              Selya, Lynch, and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Richard E. Burke, Jr., with whom James Hodgson and Law Offices\nof Beauregard, Burke & Franco were on brief, for appellant.\n     Laurence J. Donoghue, with whom Corinne L.

Mulloy\n\nappeals from the entry of summary judgment for his former employer,\n\nAcushnet Company, in a suit alleging disability discrimination in\n\nviolation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 12101-12213, and the Massachusetts anti-discrimination statute,\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, § 4.             Mulloy contends that Acushnet\n\nfailed to accommodate his disability when it refused to allow him\n\nto work from a remote location.            The district court held that\n\nMulloy was not a \"qualified individual with a disability\" under the\n\nADA or a \"qualified handicapped person\" under Chapter 151B, § 4.\n\nWe affirm.\n\n                                      I.\n\n           The following facts are undisputed except as otherwise\n\nnoted.     Acushnet,     headquartered     in   Fairhaven,    Massachusetts,\n\nmanufactures and sells golf balls and other golf equipment and\n\naccessories.     It has several manufacturing facilities, including a\n\nfacility   in    Dartmouth,     Massachusetts    (\"Ball    Plant    II\").    In\n\nDecember of 1998, Acushnet hired Michael Mulloy as one of two\n\nelectrical engineers at Ball Plant II.\n\n           The    golf   ball    manufacturing    process    uses     materials\n\ncontaining chemical sensitizers known as isocynates.                The parties\n\ndisagree as to the hazards of isocynate exposure:                  according to\n\nAcushnet, exposure to isocynates may exacerbate the symptoms of\n\nthose with asthma, allergies, or chronic respiratory problems,\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fwhile    Mulloy     believes     isocynate        exposure   may    cause     these\n\nconditions.        All   of    Acushnet's      manufacturing     facilities    use\n\nisocynates. As a result, Acushnet has developed a formal isocynate\n\nprotocol \"[t]o ensure the safe placement of any associate in an\n\narea    with    isocynate     exposure   and      to   provide   ongoing    medical\n\nmonitoring post exposure to isocynates.\"\n\n               From December 1998 through January 2001, Mulloy designed\n\nprograms for the golf ball manufacturing machines (governing their\n\nmovement and timing); specified, purchased, and supervised the\n\ninstallation of electronic controls for new and modified equipment;\n\nevaluated      machine   capabilities       and    identified    mechanical    and\n\nelectrical changes; trained and supported maintenance personnel to\n\n\"troubleshoot\" (i.e., respond to malfunctions with) electrical and\n\nelectronic controls; supported electrical safety programs; and\n\nspecified electrical services for new machines.                      During this\n\nperiod, Mulloy spent an average of two hours per day on the\n\nmanufacturing floor, and another six hours per day in his cubicle\n\naway from the manufacturing floor.             Some days, Mulloy spent all or\n\na majority of his day on the plant floor.                  The parties disagree\n\nabout whether Mulloy sometimes worked on the plant floor for a full\n\nweek or more at a time.\n\n               At the time of his hire, Mulloy completed a medical\n\nhistory form, reporting that he had no allergies, was taking no\n\nmedication, and had no prior exposure to isocynates.                 Nine months\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\flater,   however,    Mulloy   began     to   experience     throat   and    chest\n\ntightness and discomfort, and presented Acushnet with a note from\n\nhis physician reporting these symptoms.                 Acushnet responded by\n\ntaking steps under its isocynate protocol, which involved Mulloy's\n\ncompletion of an allergy questionnaire and his taking a pulmonary\n\nfunction   test.      Dr.   Charles     Lutton,    Acushnet's      occupational\n\nmedicine   consultant,      examined    Mulloy     and    referred   him    to   a\n\nrespiratory specialist, who noted no signs of isocynate sensitivity\n\nand cleared him to return to work.\n\n           On May 9, 2000, while working in the paint spray room\n\n(where golf balls are spray painted), Mulloy began to feel dizzy.\n\nOver the next several days, he felt \"foggy and feverish.\" Acushnet\n\nkept Mulloy out of the paint spray room pending further pulmonary\n\nfunction   testing   and    examination      by   Dr.    Lutton.     Dr.   Lutton\n\nrecommended that Mulloy not be exposed to isocynates or another\n\nrespiratory irritant, CX-100.          Accordingly, Mulloy was restricted\n\nfrom areas in the plant where these irritants are generated, known\n\nas \"red zones,\" and was reassigned to work on machines outside of\n\nthe red zones on the other side of the building, in areas of the\n\nplant such as \"core molding\" (where the rubber cores of golf balls\n\nare made).    When Mulloy needed to work on machines in the red\n\nzones, he did so remotely from the other side of the building by\n\nrelying on other personnel to download his programs into these\n\nmachines located in the restricted areas.\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f             This arrangement worked for over a year.                           However,\n\nbeginning in November 2001, Mulloy began to experience dizziness\n\nand other symptoms while outside of the red zones.                            Dr. Lutton\n\nexamined     Mulloy   and    recommended        that    he    be    removed    from    all\n\nAcushnet     buildings      where   isocynates         were   used.         Accordingly,\n\nAcushnet     transferred      him    to   its     headquarters         in     Fairhaven,\n\nMassachusetts, located fifteen miles away from Ball Plant II, where\n\nthere   is   no   manufacturing       and   no     use       of    chemicals    such   as\n\nisocynates.\n\n             The parties disagree about the extent to which Mulloy\n\ncontinued to perform his job functions in Fairhaven.                              Mulloy\n\ncontends that he continued to perform all of his job functions in\n\nFairhaven, and even received a positive job performance evaluation\n\nthree months after his transfer.                 Acushnet contends that while\n\nMulloy was able to perform some of the functions of his job, his\n\ninability to enter the plant prevented him from performing others.\n\nFollowing his transfer to Fairhaven, the Vice President of Employee\n\nRelations, Ken Riall, consulted with Acushnet's Vice President of\n\nGolf Ball Manufacturing, Eric Bartsch, and its Director of Health\n\nSafety and Field Services, Jean Sutherland, regarding what tasks\n\nMulloy could perform and what accommodations could be made for his\n\nlimitations. Riall specifically asked Bartsch whether Mulloy could\n\nperform his job remotely.           Bartsh concluded that Mulloy could not.\n\nRiall did not consult with Kimberly Francis, the Director of\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fEngineering at Ball Plant II and Mulloy's immediate supervisor. On\n\nJanuary 10, 2002, Acushnet told Mulloy that his employment would be\n\nterminated effective March 4, 2002.\n\n          Approximately 50% of the work that Mulloy used to perform\n\nis now done by Acushnet employees inside the plant.             Due to a\n\nshortage of personnel, another 40% of the work Mulloy used to\n\nperform is handled by outside vendors, and the majority of this\n\nwork (70%) is likewise performed inside the plant.                  A small\n\npercentage of the work (10%) that Mulloy used to perform has been\n\ndesignated low-priority by Acushnet and, therefore, is not being\n\ndone.\n\n          Since his termination from Acushnet, Mulloy has been\n\ndiagnosed with occupational asthma. The parties disagree about the\n\nextent of the limitations imposed by this diagnosis.                 Mulloy\n\ncontends that he is \"permanently partially disabled\" and can work\n\nonly in a \"meticulously clean work environment because exposure to\n\ndusts and numerous common chemical compounds . . . can trigger a\n\nrespiratory attack.\"      Acushnet argues that, based on the medical\n\nevidence, Mulloy need only avoid working in areas containing\n\nisocynates or other volatile chemicals.        Mulloy also contends that\n\nhe sustained emotional and psychological damage as a result of his\n\ntermination which may preclude him from future employment.\n\n          For   several    years   following   his   termination,    Mulloy\n\nsought employment as an electrical engineer and also considered\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fother job options such as teaching, to no avail.                         He eventually\n\nenrolled as a full-time student at Syracuse Law School.                       On May 28,\n\n2003, Mulloy filed a complaint in the district court, alleging that\n\nAcushnet discriminated against him on the basis of his disability\n\nin   violation    of   the     ADA     and    Chapter       151B,   §    4.      Acushnet\n\nsubsequently     filed    a    motion    for     summary      judgment,       which   the\n\ndistrict court granted.          This appeal followed.\n\n                                         II.\n\n            Summary      judgment       is    proper        where   \"the      pleadings,\n\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\n\ntogether with affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled\n\nto judgment as a matter of law.\"              Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).           \"The mere\n\nexistence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will\n\nnot defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary\n\njudgment; the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact.\"        Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242,\n\n247-48 (1986) (emphasis in original). \"For the purposes of summary\n\njudgment,   'genuine'         means    that    the    evidence      is    such    that   a\n\nreasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party, and\n\na 'material fact' is one which 'might affect the outcome of the\n\nsuit under the governing law.'\"                 Seaboard Sur. Co. v.

While   we\n\n\"constru[e] the record in the light most favorable to the nonmovant\n\nand resolv[e] all reasonable inferences in that party's favor[,] .\n\n.    .   we    can    safely    ignore    conclusory     allegations,     improbable\n\ninferences, and unsupported speculation.\"                 Carroll v. Xerox Corp.,\n\n294 F.3d 231, 237 (1st Cir. 2002) (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitation omitted).             In so doing, \"[w]e are not wed to the lower\n\ncourt's rationale but, rather, may affirm the entry of summary\n\njudgment on any ground made manifest by the record.\"                     Okmyansky v.\n\nHerbalife Int'l of America, Inc., 415 F.3d 154, 158 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).\n\n                                           III.\n\nA.              The ADA\n\n                The ADA prohibits discrimination against \"a qualified\n\nindividual with a disability\" –- that is, \"an individual with a\n\ndisability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can\n\nperform the essential functions of the employment position that\n\nsuch individual holds or desires\" –- \"based on that disability.\"\n\n42 U.S.C. §§ 12111(8), 12112(a).                  In order to establish a claim\n\nunder the ADA, a plaintiff must prove the following three elements\n\nby a preponderance of the evidence:                 first, that she is disabled\n\nwithin the meaning of the ADA, i.e., that she has \"a physical or\n\n\n                                           -8-\n\fmental impairment that substantially limits one or more [] major\n\nlife activities,\" 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2); \"second, . . . that with or\n\nwithout reasonable accommodation she was a qualified individual\n\nable       to   perform   the   essential   functions    of   the   job;   and\n\nthird, . . . that the employer discharged her because of her\n\ndisability.\"        García-Ayala v. Lederle Parenterals, Inc., 212 F.3d\n\n638, 646 (1st Cir. 2000) (internal citation and quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\nB.              The District Court Proceeding\n\n                The district court held that Mulloy's disability claim\n\nfailed to satisfy both the first and second elements of the ADA.1\n\nUnder the first element, the district court held that Mulloy failed\n\nto \"present[] sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment on\n\nthe issue of 'substantial impairment' either of breathing or of\n\nworking.\"        Mulloy, 2005 WL 1528208, at *5.        With respect to the\n\nmajor life activity of breathing, the district court held that\n\n\"[Mulloy was] not symptomatic most of the time,\" and that \"[i]t is\n\nnot sufficient . . . simply to have intermittent responses to\n\nparticular irritants.\"          Id.   As for the major life activity of\n\nworking, the district court held that \"it is a particular job at a\n\n\n       1\n       Relying on our authority that Chapter 151B, § 4 \"tracks the\nADA in virtually all respects,\" Gillen v. Fallon Ambulance Serv.,\nInc., 283 F.3d 11, 21 n.5 (1st Cir. 2002), the district court did\nnot separately analyze Mulloy's claim under Chapter 151B, § 4. See\nMulloy v. Acushnet Co., No. Civ.A. 03-11077-DPW, 2005 WL 1528208,\nat *1 n.1 (D. Mass. June 20, 2005). We analyze the state law claim\nlater in this opinion, see infra Part III(D).\n\n                                      -9-\n\fparticular location for which [Mulloy's] breathing difficulties\n\ncreate an impairment,\" and that \"it is not enough to show that an\n\nindividual is substantially limited in his ability to perform his\n\nparticular job.\"   Id. at *4.\n\n           Turning to the second element of the ADA,2 the district\n\ncourt held that Mulloy was not an otherwise qualified individual\n\ncapable of performing the essential functions of his job with or\n\nwithout reasonable accommodation. Specifically, the district court\n\nfound that \"it is essential not only that [Mulloy] interact with\n\nthose for whom he has responsibility [for] training and supporting,\n\nbut also that he interact . . . with machines found in the plant.\"\n\nId. at *9.   These essential functions, the district court held,\n\n\"require [Mulloy's] physical presence\" in Ball Plant II.    Id. at\n\n*10.\n\n           Since the only accommodation proposed by Mulloy –- i.e.,\n\nworking from a remote location –- \"inherently vitiate[d] [Mulloy's]\n\n\n\n       2\n       While the district court could have ended its analysis after\ndeciding that Mulloy failed to satisfy the first element of the\nADA, the district court turned to the second element \"[i]n the\ninterests of completeness and recognizing that the law of\nsubstantial impairment –- at least to 'working' –- is not yet\ncompletely settled.\" Mulloy, 2005 WL 1528208, at *5. The district\ncourt's comment is understandable. Compare Sutton v. United Air\nLines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471, 492 (1999) (noting \"some conceptual\ndifficulty in defining 'major life activities' to include work\"\nunder the ADA), with Guzmán-Rosario v. United Parcel Serv., Inc.,\n397 F.3d 6, 11 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"Awaiting a definitive ruling from\nthe Supreme Court otherwise, we have assumed that 'working' is a\nmajor life activity.\"), and Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 151B, § 1(20)\n(including \"working\" among \"major life activities\").\n\n                                -10-\n\fability       to    perform    essential     functions,\"      the    district    court\n\nconcluded that it was not reasonable.               Id.     Such an accommodation,\n\nthe    district        court    stated,      \"in   essence      requires     not      an\n\naccommodation but a redefinition of his job.\"                  Id.    Even assuming\n\nthat technological aids such as a web camera \"might permit [Mulloy]\n\nto do his job from another location,\" the district court concluded\n\nthat such an accommodation would necessitate the hiring of an\n\nadditional employee to man the camera, and would thus impose an\n\nundue hardship on Acushnet.            Id.\n\nC.             Application of the ADA\n\n               1.       First Element:       Substantial Limitation of a Major\n                        Life Activity\n\n               Mulloy argues that he is disabled under the ADA because\n\nhis occupational asthma substantially limits his ability to breathe\n\nand work.3         Acushnet argues that Mulloy is not \"disabled\" because\n\n\"his       breathing   was     only   affected     at   a   particular     job   at   a\n\nparticular location\" and, with respect to the major life activity\n\nof working, he \"did not show that he was limited from a broad range\n\nor class of jobs.\"        We need not decide whether Mulloy was disabled\n\nwithin the meaning of the ADA.             The second element of an ADA claim\n\n-– i.e., whether Mulloy was a qualified individual capable of\n\n\n\n       3\n       For argument's sake, we assume that \"working\" is a \"major\nlife activity\" under the ADA. See Guzmán-Rosario, 397 F.3d at 11.\nUnlike the ADA, Chapter 151B, § 1(20) of the General Laws of the\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts includes \"working\" among \"major life\nactivities\".\n\n                                          -11-\n\fperforming the essential functions of his job with or without\n\nreasonable accommodation –- provides a sufficient basis for the\n\ndecision.    We therefore assume without deciding that Mulloy was\n\ndisabled under the ADA.\n\n            2.        Second Element: Qualified Individual Capable of\n                      Performing Essential Functions With or Without\n                      Reasonable Accommodation\n\n            \"In order to be a 'qualified individual' under the Act,\n\nthe burden is on the employee to show:           first, that she possesses\n\nthe requisite skill, experience, education and other job-related\n\nrequirements for the position, and second, that she is able to\n\nperform the essential functions of the position with or without\n\nreasonable accommodation.\" García-Ayala, 212 F.3d at 646 (internal\n\ncitation, quotation marks, and brackets omitted); see also 29\n\nC.F.R. § 1630.2(m).      There is no dispute that Mulloy satisfies the\n\nfirst of these requirements.\n\n            Turning    to   the   second    requirement,   we   must   analyze\n\n\"whether the individual can perform the essential functions of her\n\nposition\" without reasonable accommodation; and if not, whether\n\n\"any reasonable accommodation by her employer would allow her to do\n\nso.\"     Phelps v.

Courts have treated the issue both ways.\n\nCompare Mason, 357 F.3d at 1122 (\"[T]he district court properly\n\nheld Mason's physical attendance at the administration center was\n\nan essential function of the service coordinator position because\n\nthe position required supervision and teamwork.\"), and Hypes v.\n\nFirst Commerce Corp., 134 F.3d 721, 727 (5th Cir. 1998) (\"[R]egular\n\nattendance is an essential function of most jobs.\"), with Kvorjak,\n\n259 F.3d at 54 (\"The particular question we face here is whether\n\nappellant can 'perform the essential functions of the position' if\n\ngiven the accommodation he seeks, working at home.\"), and Smith v.\n\n\n                               -14-\n\fAmeritech, 129 F.3d 857, 867 (6th Cir. 1997) (concluding that\n\n\"plaintiff       failed    to    propose      an   objectively   reasonable\n\naccommodation for his disability\" because he could not perform any\n\nof his job functions from home).             The district court referred to\n\nboth approaches in its decision.           See Mulloy, 2005 WL 1528208, at\n\n*6 n.2, 11 (referring to physical presence as both \"necessary for\n\n[Mulloy] to be able to perform the essential functions of his\n\nposition,\" on the one hand, and as \"an essential function of Mr.\n\nMulloy's position\" and \"a shorthand for [essential] functions,\" on\n\nthe other).      We think it makes more sense on the facts of this case\n\nto treat Mulloy's remote location claim as a question of essential\n\nfunctions.\n\n                      a.   Essential Functions\n\n               Here, the parties do not dispute that Mulloy's essential\n\nfunctions as a senior electrical engineer at Acushnet's Ball Plant\n\nII   included     designing     and   programming;   troubleshooting4;   and\n\ntraining, supervising, and supporting personnel.             They disagree\n\nabout whether physical presence was required to perform these\n\nfunctions and was thereby, itself, an essential function of the\n\njob.       Mulloy bears the burden of establishing that he can perform\n\nhis job remotely.      See Kvorjak, 259 F.3d at 55.       Acushnet produced\n\nvoluminous evidence in the summary judgment record to challenge\n\n\n\n       4\n       As discussed below, Mulloy tries unpersuasively to create a\ndispute about troubleshooting as an essential function.\n\n                                      -15-\n\fthat proposition.     We turn now to an evaluation of the evidence on\n\nthis essential function issue.\n\n                          i.       Employer's Judgment\n\n           Acushnet argues that, in the judgment of those most\n\nfamiliar with Mulloy's job functions, Mulloy's physical presence at\n\nBall Plant II was an essential function of his job.                   Kimberly\n\nFrancis, who was Acushnet's Director of Engineering and Mulloy's\n\nsupervisor, stated that \"[t]o carry out the full responsibilities\n\nof the job, [Mulloy] was required to have interaction with the\n\noperator of the machine and the machine itself,\" which necessarily\n\n\"required entrance into the Ball Plant.\"             Specifically, Francis\n\nstated that in order to troubleshoot, support electrical safety\n\nprograms, lead investigations, and take corrective actions, Mulloy\n\n\"had to enter the plant floor, plug his computer into the system to\n\naccess the program and observe how the machine was reacting to the\n\nprogram   commands.   .   .    .   This   task   could   not   be   efficiently\n\nperformed from a remote location since many of the adjustments are\n\ntime sensitive.\" According to Francis, \"[Mulloy] needed to be able\n\nto visually watch the equipment to be able to trouble-shoot it.\"\n\nWhile he could \"see the controls operation\" from a remote location,\n\nhe could not \"assess [] what the operator is doing, product\n\nquality, whether or not [the machine is] shooting balls in the\n\nair.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\f            In order to design and program the machines, Francis\n\nstated    that    Mulloy    \"had   to    work    with   technicians      and    other\n\nengineers on the plant floor . . . [and] enter the area with the\n\nmachine to make adjustments and finalize the program.                        To fully\n\nperform   this     function,     the    engineer     must    have   access     to   the\n\nmachines.\"       Francis stated that Mulloy also needed to be able to\n\nphysically       access    the   machines       in   order    to    perform    manual\n\nadjustments on them and to fully perform the \"hands-on\" training\n\nfunction of his job.\n\n            Francis stated that from May 2000 to November 2001, when\n\nMulloy was restricted from accessing machines in the red zones,\n\n\"Mulloy was reassigned to machines outside of the red zone in the\n\nBall Plant so that he could fully perform all of the necessary\n\nfunctions of the job.            During this time, approximately eighty\n\npercent (80%) of his work was on machines located outside of the\n\nred zone.\"       Mulloy continued to perform a small amount of work -–\n\npresumably, approximately 20% –- on machines inside the red zones,\n\nbut relied on others physically to access the machines for him.\n\nWhen Mulloy was restricted from Ball Plant II, however, Francis\n\nstated that he no longer had \"regular[] access [to] the machines\"\n\nand the machine operators and, thus, \"was unable to perform the\n\nnecessary responsibilities and functions of his job as a senior\n\nelectrical engineer.\"        Eric Bartsch, Acushnet's Vice President of\n\nGolf Ball Manufacturing, who had supervised Acushnet's electrical\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\fengineers during his eighteen years at Acushnet, also stated that\n\n\"Mr. Mulloy could not perform the necessary responsibilities and\n\nfunctions    of    the    electrical      engineering       job    from   a   remote\n\nlocation.\"        According   to   Francis,       Mulloy's    job    in   Fairhaven\n\nconsisted of \"finishing up\" the documentation of previous projects\n\non which he worked in Ball Plant II.             Francis stated that \"[Mulloy]\n\nwas no longer assigned work that required access to the machines,\"\n\nand instead, [these] assignments were given to other engineers or\n\ntechnicians in the Ball Plant or to outside vendors.\"                         Bartsch\n\nsimilarly stated that after Mulloy was transferred to Fairhaven,\n\n\"his tasks were reprioritized and he was instructed to work on\n\ndocumentation and a few small tasks that did not require him to\n\nenter the Ball Plant.\"\n\n            Not    surprisingly,      Mulloy      rejects    the    views     of   his\n\nemployer.    Instead, he asserts that his physical presence in Ball\n\nPlant II was not required, and that he performed –- and could have\n\ncontinued to perform –- his essential job functions remotely from\n\nthe Fairhaven facility. Mulloy presents five arguments challenging\n\nthe judgment of his employer.\n\n                                   (1)    Mulloy's Familiarity With the\n                                          Machines and Their Operators\n\n            Mulloy first offers his own testimony that he did not\n\nhave to see the machines or those operating them in order to\n\nperform   his     job    functions,      given    his   \"long      experience      and\n\nfamiliarity with the programming, the machines, the electrical\n\n                                         -18-\n\fcircuits,     and   the   machine   operators,\"   and    his   ability    to\n\ncommunicate    with   mechanical    engineers   and   technicians   on   the\n\nmanufacturing floor \"using telephone communications and remote\n\ncomputer technology.\"      In light of the substantial weight we must\n\naccord Acushnet's view of Mulloy's job requirements, together with\n\nthe wealth of authority recognizing physical attendance as an\n\nessential function of most jobs,5 we agree with the district court\n\nthat Mulloy's own self-serving testimony that he could perform the\n\nessential functions of his job from Fairhaven \"is insufficient\n\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c) to create a 'genuine' issue of material\n\nfact concerning the essential functions of [his job].\"          Mason, 357\n\nF.3d at 1121; see id. at 1122 (\"We are reluctant to allow employees\n\n\n     5\n       See, e.g., Mason, 357 F.3d at 1122 (\"[T]he district court\nproperly held Mason's physical attendance at the administration\ncenter was an essential function of the service coordinator\nposition because the position required supervision and teamwork.\");\naccord Hypes, 134 F.3d at 727; Vande Zande v. State of Wis. Dep't\nof Admin., 44 F.3d 538, 545 (7th Cir. 1995) (\"[I]t would take a\nvery extraordinary case for the employee to be able to create a\ntriable issue of the employer's failure to allow the employee to\nwork at home.\"); Carr v. Reno, 23 F.3d 525, 530 (D.C. Cir. 1994);\nTyndall v. Nat'l Educ.

Although most of these cases\ninvolve requests to work from home as opposed to a satellite\noffice, we agree with Acushnet that they are not distinguishable on\nthat basis since both involve work from a location remote from the\nactual worksite.\n\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\fto define the essential functions of their positions based solely\n\non their personal viewpoint and experience.\").\n\n                                (2)     Mulloy's Ability to Work On-Site\n                                        but Outside of Red Zones\n\n            Mulloy   points    to     his   performance       of   the    essential\n\nfunctions of his job on-site but outside of the red zones as\n\nevidence of his ability to work off-site.             We find this comparison\n\nunavailing.    Acushnet does not dispute that Mulloy performed the\n\nessential functions of his job when he was on-site.6                   After being\n\nrestricted from the red zones, Francis stated that 80% of Mulloy's\n\nwork assignments were reallocated to machines located outside of\n\nthe red zones.       The other 20% of his work related to machines\n\nlocated within the red zones that did not require physical access.\n\nFrancis stated that, with respect to those machines located in the\n\nred zones, Mulloy relied on another electrical engineer, Ken Souza,\n\nand one of Acushnet's electrical technicians, George Desrosiers, to\n\naccess the restricted areas.          Mulloy similarly testified that when\n\nhe was restricted from the red zones, his focus shifted to problems\n\nin   the   non-restricted     \"half    of     the   plant,\"    while     Desrosiers\n\n\"switched places\" with him.            In this way, Mulloy was able to\n\nperform the essential functions of his job while on-site, even\n\n\n      6\n       In her affidavit, Francis states that after Mulloy was\nremoved from the red zones, \"he was not capable of fully performing\nthe training function of his job.\" Acushnet does not press this\nargument in its brief, and instead concedes that while Mulloy could\nperform his essential functions on-site, he could not do so after\nhe was restricted from Ball Plant II.\n\n                                       -20-\n\fthough he was not able to access all of the manufacturing machines\n\nbecause some of them were located in the red zones.\n\n          When Mulloy was transferred off-site, however, he could\n\nno longer access any of the manufacturing machines, including those\n\noutside of the red zones.   As the district court stated, the fact\n\nthat Mulloy may have been able to perform the essential functions\n\nof his job on-site despite \"not [being] able to see some of the\n\nmachines upon which he directed work to be done . . . does not\n\nsupport an inference that he could adequately perform his job\n\nwithout being able to see any of the machines or be easily\n\naccessible to those working on them.\"    Mulloy, 2005 WL 1528208, at\n\n*8.   In short, Mulloy's ability to perform his job functions on-\n\nsite has nothing to do with his ability to perform his job remotely\n\nand, therefore, does not support his argument that he could perform\n\nthe essential functions of his job from Fairhaven.\n\n                            (3)    Francis'   Positive   Evaluation   of\n                                   Mulloy\n\n          Mulloy argues that Francis' positive evaluation of his\n\nwork on February 19, 2002, more than two months after he was\n\ntransferred to Fairhaven, demonstrates that he was able to perform\n\nthe essential functions of his job remotely.      We disagree.   While\n\nthe evaluation does not set forth the period of evaluation, it\n\nappears to be an annual evaluation based on the numerous work\n\nprojects listed and its reference to \"last year's review.\"       It is\n\nundisputed that after his transfer to the Fairhaven facility at the\n\n                                  -21-\n\fend of November 2001, Mulloy continued performing some of the tasks\n\nthat he had performed at Ball Plant II for approximately one and a\n\nhalf months, until January 10, 2002, when Mulloy was asked to spend\n\n90% of his time typing manuals and his projects were assigned to\n\nother   engineers.       Therefore,     regardless       of    when    the   annual\n\nevaluation      began,   Mulloy's   off-site      work    on    Ball     Plant    II\n\nassignments comprised only one and a half months of the work\n\nreviewed in that evaluation period.            Francis' positive evaluation\n\nof   Mulloy's     performance    for    the    entire    year    thus     provides\n\ninadequate   support     for    Mulloy's      argument   that    he    could     work\n\nremotely from Fairhaven.        In fact, Francis states unequivocally in\n\nboth her deposition testimony and affidavit that Mulloy could not\n\nwork remotely.\n\n                                 (4)    Francis' Post-Termination\n                                        Statements\n\n            Mulloy also argues that the district court should not\n\nhave credited Francis' statements because Riall did not consult\n\nFrancis prior to terminating Mulloy, and thus did not rely on the\n\ninformation that she provided in his decision to terminate.                       We\n\ndisagree.    Francis' statements mirror the conclusions of Bartsch\n\nwho was consulted prior to Mulloy's termination and, therefore,\n\ncorroborate Acushnet's basis for terminating him.                     The district\n\ncourt, therefore, did not err in considering this evidence.                      The\n\ndistrict court likewise did not err in considering the statements\n\nof Bartsch, who \"ha[d] worked at Acushnet for eighteen (18) years,\"\n\n                                       -22-\n\f\"was knowledgeable of the necessary responsibilities and functions\n\nof the senior electrical engineering job at Ball Plant II,\" and who\n\n\"determined that Mr. Mulloy was unable to perform the necessary\n\nresponsibilities and functions of the senior electrical engineer\n\njob from a remote location.\"\n\n                                   (5)     Francis' Statements About\n                                           Troubleshooting\n\n              Mulloy also argues that the district court erred in\n\ncrediting Francis' statement that Mulloy needed to see the machines\n\nin   order    to    troubleshoot    them.         Mulloy    notes    that    the   job\n\ndescription refers only to \"training and supporting maintenance\n\npersonnel     to    troubleshoot.\"         According   to     Mulloy,   it    is   the\n\nmaintenance personnel -– not Mulloy -– who need to be able to see\n\nthe machines.       Even if we ascribe this meaning to the words cited\n\nby Mulloy, Mulloy's argument is not significantly probative and, in\n\nall events, it is directly contradicted by other items in the\n\nrecord.      In a second, more detailed job description not referenced\n\nby   Mulloy,       the   duties    of     an     electrical    engineer      include\n\n\"troubleshoot[ing] process-related issues using proven problem\n\nsolving techniques\" as well as \"[t]rain[ing] and support[ing]\n\nmaintenance personnel to troubleshoot.\"                And in his Statement of\n\nMaterial Facts, Mulloy expressly agreed with Acushnet's list of job\n\nresponsibilities,        which     included        \"training     and     supporting\n\nmaintenance        personnel,     [and]     troubleshooting         electrical     and\n\nelectronic controls,\" as well as with Acushnet's statement that\n\n                                          -23-\n\fMulloy \"was responsible for troubleshooting and developing new\n\nequipment.\" The district court did not err in considering Francis'\n\nstatements about troubleshooting.\n\n                            ii.    Job Description\n\n              Acushnet points to the job description for an electrical\n\nengineer at Acushnet in support of its argument that physical\n\npresence was an essential function.          Among the essential functions\n\nlisted   in    the   job   description   are   teamwork,      troubleshooting,\n\nevaluating, and training and supporting –- all of which imply some\n\nlevel of interaction with the machines and personnel at Ball Plant\n\nII.    \"We are not persuaded the absence of [physical attendance]\n\nfrom   the    job    description    demonstrates     th[at]    function   [was]\n\nnon-essential.       As commonsense suggests, [the employer] probably\n\ndid not even consider informing its employees that they were\n\nactually required to show up at the workplace . . . when it drafted\n\nthe [] job description –- that is a given.\"              Mason, 357 F.3d at\n\n1122; see also Kvorjak, 259 F.3d at 57 n.17 (holding that \"claims\n\nadjudicator's duties as advisor to other call center staff,\" which\n\ninclude troubleshooting, teamwork, and training staff members,\n\n\"demonstrate[] that the position cannot be performed at home\"); id.\n\nat 57 (\"Courts that have rejected working at home as a reasonable\n\naccommodation focus on evidence that personal contact, interaction,\n\nand coordination are needed for a specific position.\" (quoting EEOC\n\nEnforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship\n\n\n                                      -24-\n\fUnder the Americans with Disabilities Act, 1999 WL 33305876, at *34\n\nn. 93 (March 1, 1999)) (internal quotation marks omitted)); Vande\n\nZande, 44 F.3d at 544 (\"Most jobs in organizations public or\n\nprivate involve team work under supervision rather than solitary\n\nunsupervised work, and team work under supervision generally cannot\n\nbe performed at home without a substantial reduction in the quality\n\nof the employee's performance.\"). We therefore agree with Acushnet\n\nthat the job description for an electrical engineer supports\n\nAcushnet's   argument   that   Mulloy's   physical   presence   was   an\n\nessential function of his job.\n\n          Mulloy argues that since \"the job description specifies\n\nthat the troubleshooting oversight function represents only 10% of\n\nMulloy's overall responsibilities,\" troubleshooting is a \"marginal\"\n\n–- not an \"essential\" -– function. This argument also lacks merit.\n\nMulloy explicitly states that the parties \"stipulated that the\n\n'essential functions' of Mulloy's former position as a senior\n\nelectrical engineer in Acushnet's Ball Plant II are accurately\n\nrepresented in a company-drafted job description for Mulloy's\n\nposition.\" This job description lists \"trouble-shooting\" as one of\n\nthose functions.   Mulloy cannot now claim that troubleshooting is\n\nonly a marginal function. Even if Mulloy had not stipulated to the\n\nessential nature of this function, a job function requiring 10% of\n\nMulloy's time is not insignificant when considered in relation to\n\n\n\n\n                                 -25-\n\fthe five remaining essential functions of his job, each of which\n\nrequires only 10% to 25% of his time.\n\n                           iii. Work Experience of Past Incumbents and\n                                Current Incumbents\n\n              Mulloy offers no evidence that any electrical engineer at\n\nAcushnet has ever performed the job remotely.           As the district\n\ncourt stated, \"Mulloy has no testimony from other former and\n\ncurrent employees –- and in particular, from the other senior\n\nelectrical engineer at Acushnet –- to substantiate his view of the\n\nessential duties of his position.\" Mulloy, 2005 WL 1528208, at *8;\n\nsee id. (\"Appellant could have, but did not, depose current claims\n\nadjudicators about their duties.\" (quoting Kvorjak, 259 F.3d at 58)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted)). The absence of such evidence,\n\ntogether with Francis' testimony that she was not aware of any\n\nelectrical engineer working out of Fairhaven, supports Acushnet's\n\nargument that physical presence was an essential function of\n\nMulloy's job.\n\n              The experience of those who have taken over Mulloy's job\n\nfunctions since his termination also supports the conclusion that\n\nthe job cannot be performed remotely.         It is undisputed that over\n\n70% of Mulloy's former job functions are performed in Ball Plant II\n\nby   either    employees   or   outside   vendors.   Based   on   the   work\n\nexperience of past and current employees, Mulloy has failed to\n\npresent an adequate basis to challenge the company's contention\n\nthat his physical presence was an essential function of his job.\n\n                                    -26-\n\f                    b.   Reasonable Accommodation\n\n           Having determined that Mulloy's physical presence was an\n\nessential function of his job, we next ask whether his proposed\n\naccommodation –- working remotely from Fairhaven –- was reasonable.\n\nIt is well established that, while a reasonable accommodation may\n\ninclude job restructuring, 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B), \"[t]he law does\n\nnot require an employer to accommodate a disability by foregoing an\n\nessential function of the position or by reallocating essential\n\nfunctions to make other workers' jobs more onerous.\"          Kvorjak, 259\n\nF.3d at 57 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted); see\n\nalso Mason, 357 F.3d at 1124 (\"[A] request to work at home is\n\nunreasonable if it eliminates an essential function of the job.\");\n\nPhelps, 251 F.3d at 26 (\"Although a reasonable accommodation may\n\ninclude job restructuring, an employer need not exempt an employee\n\nfrom   performing   essential    functions,     nor   need   it   reallocate\n\nessential functions to other employees.\" (internal citation and\n\nquotation marks omitted)).      Here, Mulloy requests an accommodation\n\nwhich would prevent him from performing an essential function of\n\nhis job, namely, being physically present at Ball Plant II.\n\n           As the district court stated, Mulloy's request to work\n\nfrom Fairhaven \"in essence requires not an accommodation but a\n\nredefinition of his job.\"       Mulloy, 2005 WL 1528208, at *10.        But\n\n\"[a]n employer is not required by the ADA to create a new job for\n\nan   employee.\"     Phelps,   251   F.3d   at   27.    Mulloy's    proposed\n\n\n                                    -27-\n\faccommodation is therefore per se unreasonable.         See Mason, 357\n\nF.3d at 1124 (\"[Employee's] request for an at-home accommodation is\n\nunreasonable on its face because it seeks to eliminate an essential\n\nfunction of [employment] position.\").7      The district court did not\n\nerr   in   concluding   that   Mulloy's   proposed   accommodation   was\n\nunreasonable, and that he thus was not a \"qualified individual with\n\na disability\" under the ADA.8\n\nD.           Application of Massachusetts' Countpart to the ADA,\n             Chapter 151B, § 4\n\n             1.     Consistency Between ADA and Chapter 151B, § 4\n\n             Our analysis so far has focused on whether Mulloy was a\n\n\"qualified individual with a disability\" under the ADA.        We must\n\nnow address whether Mulloy was a \"qualified handicapped person\"\n\nunder Massachusetts' state-law counterpart to the ADA, Chapter\n\n151B, § 4.    We have previously noted that this statute \"tracks the\n\nADA in virtually all respects.\"      Gillen, 283 F.3d at 20 n.5; see\n\n\n      7\n       Since Mulloy did not propose a reasonable accommodation, we\nneed not address whether the accommodation he did propose imposed\nan undue hardship on Acushnet. See Cisneros v. Wilson, 226 F.3d\n1113, 1129 (10th Cir. 2000) (\"[Since] Plaintiff never established\nthat her request for leave was 'reasonable' . . . the court need\nnot address whether her request would constitute undue hardship.\"),\noverruled on other grounds by Bd. of Tr. of Univ. of Ala. v.\nGarrett, 531 U.S. 356, 374 n. 9 (2001); Vande Zande, 44 F.3d at 543\n(\"The employee must show that the accommodation is reasonable . .\n. . Even if this prima facie showing is made, the employer has an\nopportunity to prove that upon more careful consideration the costs\nare excessive.\").\n      8\n       Because we decide this case on the second element of the\nADA, we need not address the third element -- whether Acushnet\ndischarged Mulloy because of his disability.\n\n                                  -28-\n\falso Labonte v. Hutchins & Wheeler, 678 N.E.2d 853, 856 n.5 (Mass.\n\n1997) (\"[O]ur statutes in the area of employee discrimination law\n\nclosely mirror the [ADA].\").              The action proscribed by Chapter\n\n151B, § 4 is nearly identical to the action proscribed by the ADA.\n\nUnder Chapter 151B, an employer shall not \"discriminate against,\n\nbecause of his handicap, any person alleging to be a qualified\n\nhandicapped person,\" that is, \"a handicapped person who is capable\n\nof performing the essential functions of a particular job, or who\n\nwould   be   capable    of      performing     the   essential   functions      of   a\n\nparticular job with reasonable accommodation to his handicap.\" Id.\n\n§§ 1(16), 4.    In order to establish a claim of unlawful employment\n\ndiscrimination under Chapter 151B, a plaintiff must demonstrate the\n\nsame three requirements as under the ADA: (1) she suffers from a\n\n\"handicap,\"     i.e.,      \"a     physical      or   mental    impairment     which\n\nsubstantially limits one or more major life activities,\" id. §\n\n1(17); (2) \"[s]he is a 'qualified handicapped person'; and (3)\n\n[s]he was fired solely because of h[er] handicap,\" Labonte, 678\n\nN.E.2d at 859.\n\n             In light of these similarities, \"[t]he Supreme Judicial\n\nCourt   of   Massachusetts         has   indicated     that    federal   case    law\n\nconstruing     the   ADA     should      be    followed   in   interpreting      the\n\nMassachusetts disability law.\"                Ward, 209 F.3d at 33 n.2 (citing\n\nWheatley v. Am. Tel. & Tel.

Accordingly, while \"we write in terms of the ADA, our\n\ncomments apply with equal force to [Mulloy's] claim under [Chapter\n\n151B].\" Gillen, 283 F.3d at 20 n.5; see also Whitney v. Greenberg,\n\nRosenblatt, Kull & Bitsoli, P.C., 258 F.3d 30, 32 n.1 (1st Cir.\n\n2001)   (\"Given     the    similarity   [between      ADA   and   Massachusetts\n\ndisability law], our singular analysis disposes of both the federal\n\nand state claims.\").\n\n            2.       Impact of Massachusetts' Workers' Compensation Law\n                     on Chapter 151, § 4\n\n            Notwithstanding the many similarities between Chapter\n\n151B, § 4 and the ADA, there is a gloss which Massachusetts'\n\nworkers' compensation law, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 152, § 75B(1),\n\narguably places on the determination of a \"qualified handicapped\n\nindividual\" under Chapter 151B, § 4 for a work-related injury.\n\nChapter 152, § 75B(1) states that\n\n     [a]ny employee who has sustained a work-related injury\n     and is capable of performing the essential functions of\n     a particular job, or who would be capable of performing\n     the essential functions of such job with reasonable\n     accommodations, shall be deemed to be a qualified\n     handicapped person under the provisions of chapter one\n     hundred and fifty-one B.\n\n            Mulloy argues that even if he is not disabled under the\n\nADA, he is nevertheless a per se \"qualified handicapped person\"\n\nunder     Chapter   151B     by   virtue    of   the    interaction     between\n\nMassachusetts' anti-discrimination law and Massachusetts' workers'\n\ncompensation law.         In other words, Mulloy contends that Chapter\n\n                                     -30-\n\f152, § 75B(1) entitles him to special treatment under Chapter 151B,\n\n§ 4 –- treatment not recognized under the ADA.\n\n             The meaning of Chapter 152, § 75B(1) is unclear.              The\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Massachusetts has\n\ndescribed the statute as a \"major exception to the traditional\n\ndefinition of a 'handicapped person,'\" which expands the protection\n\nafforded by Chapter 151B to plaintiffs regardless of whether they\n\ncan demonstrate substantial limitation of a major life activity.\n\nSee Gilman v. C & S Wholesale Grocers, Inc., 170 F. Supp. 2d 77, 85\n\n(D. Mass. 2001) (holding that a plaintiff who suffered a work-\n\nrelated   injury    and    was     capable   of   performing   the   essential\n\nfunctions of his job under Chapter 152, § 75B(1) \"cannot be\n\nexcluded as a matter of law, . . . from being a 'qualified\n\nhandicapped person' under chapter 151B\" -– notwithstanding his\n\ninability to demonstrate substantial limitation of a major life\n\nactivity).\n\n             While the Supreme Judicial Court has declined to consider\n\nthis issue, see Dartt v. Browning-Ferris Indus., Inc., 691 N.E.2d\n\n526,   536    &   n.30    (Mass.     1998)   (refusing   to    consider   \"the\n\napplicability, if any, of [Chapter 152, § 75B(1)] to [plaintiff's]\n\nclaim,\" given the \"slight\" evidence that plaintiff was regarded as\n\nhaving a substantially limiting impairment under Chapter 151B), the\n\nmajority of Massachusetts' lower courts similarly view Chapter 152,\n\n§ 75B(1) as an alternative means for plaintiffs to demonstrate that\n\n\n                                      -31-\n\fthey are \"qualified handicapped persons.\"    Compare Everett Indus.,\n\nInc. v. Mass. Comm'n Against Discrimination, No. 98-P-960, 2000 WL\n\n1476321, at *5 & n.13 (Mass. App. Ct. June 29, 2000) (unpublished),\n\nand Zarrella v.

July\n\n22, 1998).\n\n          We need not resolve this uncertainty here.        While it\n\nremains unclear whether, by virtue of Chapter 152, § 75B(1), a\n\nplaintiff can forego showing substantial limitation of a major life\n\nactivity and still be deemed a \"qualified handicapped person\" under\n\nChapter 151B, § 4, one thing is clear:    both Chapter 151B, § 4 and\n\nChapter 152, § 75B(1) require that a plaintiff be \"capable of\n\nperforming the essential functions of a particular job, or [] be\n\ncapable of performing the essential functions of a particular job\n\nwith reasonable accommodation.\"       Mulloy argues that since \"the\n\nonset of [his] occupational asthma was work-related,\" he should be\n\ndeemed a \"qualified handicapped person\" under Chapter 151B, § 4 by\n\nvirtue of Chapter 152, § 75B(1).   We disagree.   Since Mulloy cannot\n\nshow that he was capable of performing the essential functions of\n\nhis job with or without reasonable accommodation, he is not a\n\n\"qualified handicapped person\" under Chapter 151B, § 4. See Poh v.\n\nMass. Corr. Officers Federated Union, No. 03-11987-RWZ, 2006 WL\n\n1877089, at *4 (D. Mass. July 7, 2006) (holding that even if\n\n\n                               -32-\n\fChapter 152, § 75B(1) constitutes an exception to the traditional\n\ndefinition of a \"qualified handicapped person\" under Chapter 151B,\n\nplaintiff still \"does not fall within [Chapter 152, § 75B(1)'s]\n\nconfines\" because \"plaintiff has presented no evidence that he was\n\ncapable of performing the essential functions of his job.\").

Mulloy appeals from the entry of summary judgment for his former employer, Acushnet Company, in a suit alleging disability discrimination in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 12101-12213, and the Massachusetts anti-discrimination statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, &#167; 4. Mulloy contends that Acushnet failed to accommodate his disability when it refused to allow him to work from a remote location. The district court held that Mulloy was not a \"qualified individual with a disability\" under the ADA or a \"qualified handicapped person\" under Chapter 151B, &#167; 4. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following facts are undisputed except as otherwise noted. Acushnet, headquartered in Fairhaven, Massachusetts, manufactures and sells golf balls and other golf equipment and accessories. It has several manufacturing facilities, including a facility in Dartmouth, Massachusetts (\"Ball Plant II\"). In December of 1998, Acushnet hired Michael Mulloy as one of two electrical engineers at Ball Plant II.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The golf ball manufacturing process uses materials containing chemical sensitizers known as isocynates. The parties disagree as to the hazards of isocynate exposure: according to Acushnet, exposure to isocynates may exacerbate the symptoms of those with asthma, allergies, or chronic respiratory problems, while Mulloy believes isocynate exposure may cause these conditions. All of Acushnet's manufacturing facilities use isocynates. As a result, Acushnet has developed a formal isocynate protocol \"[t]o ensure the safe placement of any associate in an area with isocynate exposure and to provide ongoing medical monitoring post exposure to isocynates.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From December 1998 through January 2001, Mulloy designed programs for the golf ball manufacturing machines (governing their movement and timing); specified, purchased, and supervised the installation of electronic controls for new and modified equipment; evaluated machine capabilities and identified mechanical and electrical changes; trained and supported maintenance personnel to \"troubleshoot\" (i.e., respond to malfunctions with) electrical and electronic controls; supported electrical safety programs; and specified electrical services for new machines. During this period, Mulloy spent an average of two hours per day on the manufacturing floor, and another six hours per day in his cubicle away from the manufacturing floor. Some days, Mulloy spent all or a majority of his day on the plant floor. The parties disagree about whether Mulloy sometimes worked on the plant floor for a full week or more at a time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of his hire, Mulloy completed a medical history form, reporting that he had no allergies, was taking no medication, and had no prior exposure to isocynates. Nine months later, however, Mulloy began to experience throat and chest tightness and discomfort, and presented Acushnet with a note from his physician reporting these symptoms. Acushnet responded by taking steps under its isocynate protocol, which involved Mulloy's completion of an allergy questionnaire and his taking a pulmonary function test. Dr. Charles Lutton, Acushnet's occupational medicine consultant, examined Mulloy and referred him to a respiratory specialist, who noted no signs of isocynate sensitivity and cleared him to return to work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 9, 2000, while working in the paint spray room (where golf balls are spray painted), Mulloy began to feel dizzy. Over the next several days, he felt \"foggy and feverish.\" Acushnet kept Mulloy out of the paint spray room pending further pulmonary function testing and examination by Dr. Lutton. Dr. Lutton recommended that Mulloy not be exposed to isocynates or another respiratory irritant, CX-100. Accordingly, Mulloy was restricted from areas in the plant where these irritants are generated, known as \"red zones,\" and was reassigned to work on machines outside of the red zones on the other side of the building, in areas of the plant such as \"core molding\" (where the rubber cores of golf balls are made). When Mulloy needed to work on machines in the red zones, he did so remotely from the other side of the building by relying on other personnel to download his programs into these machines located in the restricted areas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This arrangement worked for over a year. However, beginning in November 2001, Mulloy began to experience dizziness and other symptoms while outside of the red zones. Dr. Lutton examined Mulloy and recommended that he be removed from all Acushnet buildings where isocynates were used. Accordingly, Acushnet transferred him to its headquarters in Fairhaven, Massachusetts, located fifteen miles away from Ball Plant II, where there is no manufacturing and no use of chemicals such as isocynates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties disagree about the extent to which Mulloy continued to perform his job functions in Fairhaven. Mulloy contends that he continued to perform all of his job functions in Fairhaven, and even received a positive job performance evaluation three months after his transfer. Acushnet contends that while Mulloy was able to perform some of the functions of his job, his inability to enter the plant prevented him from performing others. Following his transfer to Fairhaven, the Vice President of Employee Relations, Ken Riall, consulted with Acushnet's Vice President of Golf Ball Manufacturing, Eric Bartsch, and its Director of Health Safety and Field Services, Jean Sutherland, regarding what tasks Mulloy could perform and what accommodations could be made for his limitations. Riall specifically asked Bartsch whether Mulloy could perform his job remotely. Bartsh concluded that Mulloy could not. Riall did not consult with Kimberly Francis, the Director of Engineering at Ball Plant II and Mulloy's immediate supervisor. On January 10, 2002, Acushnet told Mulloy that his employment would be terminated effective March 4, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approximately 50% of the work that Mulloy used to perform is now done by Acushnet employees inside the plant. Due to a shortage of personnel, another 40% of the work Mulloy used to perform is handled by outside vendors, and the majority of this work (70%) is likewise performed inside the plant. A small percentage of the work (10%) that Mulloy used to perform has been designated low-priority by Acushnet and, therefore, is not being done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since his termination from Acushnet, Mulloy has been diagnosed with occupational asthma. The parties disagree about the extent of the limitations imposed by this diagnosis. Mulloy contends that he is \"permanently partially disabled\" and can work only in a \"meticulously clean work environment because exposure to dusts and numerous common chemical compounds . . . can trigger a respiratory attack.\" Acushnet argues that, based on the medical evidence, Mulloy need only avoid working in areas containing isocynates or other volatile chemicals.

They disagree about whether physical presence was required to perform these functions and was thereby, itself, an essential function of the job. Mulloy bears the burden of establishing that he can perform his job remotely. <i>See Kvorjak,</i> 259 F.3d at 55. Acushnet produced voluminous evidence in the summary judgment record to challenge that proposition. We turn now to an evaluation of the evidence on this essential function issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">i. Employer's Judgment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Acushnet argues that, in the judgment of those most familiar with Mulloy's job functions, Mulloy's physical presence at Ball Plant II was an essential function of his job. Kimberly Francis, who was Acushnet's Director of Engineering and Mulloy's supervisor, stated that \"[t]o carry out the full responsibilities of the job, [Mulloy] was required to have interaction with the operator of the machine and the machine itself,\" which necessarily \"required entrance into the Ball Plant.\" Specifically, Francis stated that in order to troubleshoot, support electrical safety programs, lead investigations, and take corrective actions, Mulloy \"had to enter the plant floor, plug his computer into the system to access the program and observe how the machine was reacting to the program commands. . . . This task could not be efficiently performed from a remote location since many of the adjustments are time sensitive.\" According to Francis, \"[Mulloy] needed to be able to visually watch the equipment to be able to troubleshoot it.\" While he could \"see the controls operation\" from a remote location, he could not \"assess [] what the operator is doing, product quality, whether or not [the machine is] shooting balls in the air.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to design and program the machines, Francis stated that Mulloy \"had to work with technicians and other engineers on the plant floor . . . [and] enter the area with the machine to make adjustments and finalize the program. To fully perform this function, the engineer must have access to the machines.\" Francis stated that Mulloy also needed to be able to physically access the machines in order to perform manual adjustments on them and to fully perform the \"hands-on\" training function of his job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Francis stated that from May 2000 to November 2001, when Mulloy was restricted from accessing machines in the red zones, \"Mulloy was reassigned to machines outside of the red zone in the Ball Plant so that he could fully perform all of the necessary functions of the job. During this time, approximately eighty percent (80%) of his work was on machines located outside of the red zone.\" Mulloy continued to perform a small amount of work &#8212; presumably, approximately 20% &#8212; on machines inside the red zones, but relied on others physically to access the machines for him. When Mulloy was restricted from Ball Plant II, however, Francis stated that he no longer had \"regular[] access [to] the machines\" and the machine operators and, thus, \"was unable to perform the necessary responsibilities and functions of his job as a senior electrical engineer.\" Eric Bartsch, Acushnet's Vice President of Golf Ball Manufacturing, who had supervised Acushnet's electrical engineers during his eighteen years at Acushnet, also stated that \"Mr. Mulloy could not perform the necessary responsibilities and functions of the electrical engineering job from a remote location.\" According to Francis, Mulloy's job in Fairhaven consisted of \"finishing up\" the documentation of previous projects on which he worked in Ball Plant II. Francis stated that \"[Mulloy] was no longer assigned work that required access to the machines,\" and instead, \"[these] assignments were given to other engineers or technicians in the Ball Plant or to outside vendors.\" Bartsch similarly stated that after Mulloy was transferred to Fairhaven, \"his tasks were reprioritized and he was instructed to work on documentation and a few small tasks that did not require him to enter the Ball Plant.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not surprisingly, Mulloy rejects the views of his employer. Instead, he asserts that his physical presence in Ball Plant II was not required, and that he performed &#8212; and could have continued to perform &#8212; his essential job functions remotely from the Fairhaven facility. Mulloy presents five arguments challenging the judgment of his employer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) Mulloy's Familiarity With the Machines and Their Operators</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mulloy first offers his own testimony that he did not have to see the machines or those operating them in order to perform his job functions, given his \"long experience and familiarity with the programming, the machines, the electrical circuits, and the machine operators,\" and his ability to communicate with mechanical engineers and technicians on the manufacturing floor \"using telephone communications and remote computer technology.\" In light of the substantial weight we must accord Acushnet's view of Mulloy's job requirements, together with the wealth of authority recognizing physical attendance as an essential function of most jobs,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> we agree with the district court that Mulloy's own self-serving testimony that he could perform the essential functions of his job from Fairhaven \"is insufficient under Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c) to create a `genuine' issue of material fact concerning the essential functions of [his job].\" <i>Mason,</i> 357 F.3d at 1121; <i>see id.</i> at 1122 (\"We are reluctant to allow employees to define the essential functions of their positions based solely on their personal viewpoint and experience.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) Mulloy's Ability to Work On-Site but Outside of Red Zones</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mulloy points to his performance of the essential functions of his job on-site but outside of the red zones as evidence of his ability to work off-site. We find this comparison unavailing. Acushnet does not dispute that Mulloy performed the essential functions of his job when he was on-site.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> After being restricted from the red zones, Francis stated that 80% of Mulloy's work assignments were reallocated to machines located outside of the red zones. The other 20% of his work related to machines located within the red zones that did not require physical access. Francis stated that, with respect to those machines located in the red zones, Mulloy relied on another electrical engineer, Ken Souza, and one of Acushnet's electrical technicians, George Desrosiers, to access the restricted areas. Mulloy similarly testified that when he was restricted from the red zones, his focus shifted to problems in the non-restricted \"half of the plant,\" while Desrosiers \"switched places\" with him. In this way, Mulloy was able to perform the essential functions of his job while on-site, even though he was not able to access all of the manufacturing machines because some of them were located in the red zones.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Mulloy was transferred off-site, however, he could no longer access any of the manufacturing machines, including those outside of the red zones. As the district court stated, the fact that Mulloy may have been able to perform the essential functions of his job on-site despite \"not [being] able to see <i>some</i> of the machines upon which he directed work to be done . . . does not support an inference that he could adequately perform his job without being able to see <i>any</i> of the machines or be easily accessible to those working on them.\" <i>Mulloy,</i> 2005 WL 1528208, at *8. In short, Mulloy's ability to perform his job functions on-site has nothing to do with his ability to perform his job remotely and, therefore, does not support his argument that he could perform the essential functions of his job from Fairhaven.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) Francis' Positive Evaluation of Mulloy</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mulloy argues that Francis' positive evaluation of his work on February 19, 2002, more than two months after he was transferred to Fairhaven, demonstrates that he was able to perform the essential functions of his job remotely. We disagree. While the evaluation does not set forth the period of evaluation, it appears to be an annual evaluation based on the numerous work projects listed and its reference to \"last year's review.\" It is undisputed that after his transfer to the Fairhaven facility at the end of November 2001, Mulloy continued performing some of the tasks that he had performed at Ball Plant II for approximately one and a half months, until January 10, 2002, when Mulloy was asked to spend 90% of his time typing manuals and his projects were assigned to other engineers. Therefore, regardless of when the annual evaluation began, Mulloy's off-site work on Ball Plant II assignments comprised only one and a half months of the work reviewed in that evaluation period. Francis' positive evaluation of Mulloy's performance for the entire year thus provides inadequate support for Mulloy's argument that he could work remotely from Fairhaven. In fact, Francis states unequivocally in both her deposition testimony and affidavit that Mulloy could not work remotely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(4) Francis' Post-Termination Statements</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mulloy also argues that the district court should not have credited Francis' statements because Riall did not consult Francis prior to terminating Mulloy, and thus did not rely on the information that she provided in his decision to terminate. We disagree. Francis' statements mirror the conclusions of Bartsch who <i>was</i> consulted prior to Mulloy's termination and, therefore, corroborate Acushnet's basis for terminating him. The district court, therefore, did not err in considering this evidence. The district court likewise did not err in considering the statements of Bartsch, who \"ha[d] worked at Acushnet for eighteen (18) years,\" \"was knowledgeable of the necessary responsibilities and functions of the senior electrical engineering job at Ball Plant II,\" and who \"determined that Mr. Mulloy was unable to perform the necessary responsibilities and functions of the senior electrical engineer job from a remote location.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(5) Francis' Statements About Troubleshooting</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mulloy also argues that the district court erred in crediting Francis' statement that Mulloy needed to see the machines in order to troubleshoot them. Mulloy notes that the job description refers only to \"training and supporting maintenance personnel to troubleshoot.\" According to Mulloy, it is the maintenance personnel &#8212; not Mulloy &#8212; who need to be able to see the machines. Even if we ascribe this meaning to the words cited by Mulloy, Mulloy's argument is not significantly probative and, in all events, it is directly contradicted by other items in the record. In a second, more detailed job description not referenced by Mulloy, the duties of an electrical engineer include \"troubleshoot[ing] process-related issues using proven problem solving techniques\" as well as \"[t]rain[ing] and support[ing] maintenance personnel to troubleshoot.\" And in his Statement of Material Facts, Mulloy expressly agreed with Acushnet's list of job responsibilities, which included \"training and supporting maintenance personnel, [and] troubleshooting electrical and electronic controls,\" as well as with Acushnet's statement that Mulloy \"was responsible for troubleshooting and developing new equipment.\" The district court did not err in considering Francis' statements about troubleshooting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p>ii.

Among the essential functions listed in the job description are teamwork, troubleshooting, evaluating, and training and supporting &#8212; all of which imply some level of interaction with the machines and personnel at Ball Plant II. \"We are not persuaded the absence of [physical attendance] from the job description demonstrates th[at] function [was] non-essential.

We therefore agree with Acushnet that the job description for an electrical engineer supports Acushnet's argument that Mulloy's physical presence was an essential function of his job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mulloy argues that since \"the job description specifies that the troubleshooting oversight function represents only 10% of Mulloy's overall responsibilities,\" troubleshooting is a \"marginal\" &#8212; not an \"essential\" &#8212; function. This argument also lacks merit. Mulloy explicitly states that the parties \"stipulated that the `essential functions' of Mulloy's former position as a senior electrical engineer in Acushnet's Ball Plant II are accurately represented in a company-drafted job description for Mulloy's position.\" This job description lists \"trouble-shooting\" as one of those functions. Mulloy cannot now claim that troubleshooting is only a marginal function. Even if Mulloy had not stipulated to the essential nature of this function, a job function requiring 10% of Mulloy's time is not insignificant when considered in relation to the five remaining essential functions of his job, each of which requires only 10% to 25% of his time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p>iii.

As the district court stated, \"Mulloy has no testimony from other former and current employees &#8212; and in particular, from the other senior electrical engineer at Acushnet &#8212; to substantiate his view of the essential duties of his position.\" <i>Mulloy,</i> 2005 WL 1528208, at *8; <i>see id.</i> (\"Appellant could have, but did not, depose current claims adjudicators about their duties.\" (quoting <i>Kvorjak,</i> 259 F.3d at 58) (internal quotation marks omitted)). The absence of such evidence, together with Francis' testimony that she was not aware of any electrical engineer working out of Fairhaven, supports Acushnet's argument that physical presence was an essential function of Mulloy's job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The experience of those who have taken over Mulloy's job functions since his termination also supports the conclusion that the job cannot be performed remotely. It is undisputed that over 70% of Mulloy's former job functions are performed in Ball Plant II by either employees or outside vendors. Based on the work experience of past and current employees, Mulloy has failed to present an adequate basis to challenge the company's contention that his physical presence was an essential function of his job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p>b.

It is well established that, while a reasonable accommodation may include job restructuring, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12111(9)(B), \"[t]he law does not require an employer to accommodate a disability by foregoing an essential function of the position or by reallocating essential functions to make other workers' jobs more onerous.\" <i>Kvorjak,</i> 259 F.3d at 57 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted); <i>see also Mason,</i> 357 F.3d at 1124 (\"[A] request to work at home is unreasonable if it eliminates an essential function of the job.\"); <i>Phelps,</i> 251 F.3d at 26 (\"Although a reasonable accommodation may include job restructuring, an employer need not exempt an employee from performing essential functions, nor need it reallocate essential functions to other employees.\" (internal citation and quotation marks omitted)). Here, Mulloy requests an accommodation which would prevent him from performing an essential function of his job, namely, being physically present at Ball Plant II.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court stated, Mulloy's request to work from Fairhaven \"in essence requires not an accommodation but a redefinition of his job.\" <i>Mulloy,</i> 2005 WL 1528208, at *10. But \"[a]n employer is not required by the ADA to create a new job for an employee.\" <i>Phelps,</i> 251 F.3d at 27. Mulloy's proposed accommodation is therefore per se unreasonable. <i>See Mason,</i> 357 F.3d at 1124 (\"[Employee's] request for an at-home accommodation is unreasonable on its face because it seeks to eliminate an essential function of [employment] position.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> The district court did not err in concluding that Mulloy's proposed accommodation was unreasonable, and that he thus was not a \"qualified individual with a disability\" under the ADA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D.

The action proscribed by Chapter 151B, &#167; 4 is nearly identical to the action proscribed by the ADA.

In order to establish a claim of unlawful employment discrimination under Chapter 151B, a plaintiff must demonstrate the same three requirements as under the ADA: (1) she suffers from a \"handicap,\" i.e., \"a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more major life activities,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 1(17); (2) \"[s]he is a `qualified handicapped person'; and (3)[s]he was fired solely because of h[er] handicap,\" <i>Labonte,</i> 678 N.E.2d at 859.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of these similarities, \"[t]he Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has indicated that federal case law construing the ADA should be followed in interpreting the Massachusetts disability law.\" <i>Ward,</i> 209 F.3d at 33 n. 2 (citing <i>Wheatley v.

Gen. Laws ch. 152, &#167; 75B(1), arguably places on the determination of a \"qualified handicapped individual\" under Chapter 151B, &#167; 4 for a work-related injury. Chapter 152, &#167; 75B(1), states that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[a]ny employee who has sustained a work-related injury and is capable of performing the essential functions of a particular job, or who would be capable of performing the essential functions of such job with reasonable accommodations, shall be deemed to be a qualified handicapped person under the provisions of chapter one hundred and fifty-one B.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mulloy argues that even if he is not disabled under the ADA, he is nevertheless a per se \"qualified handicapped person\" under Chapter 151B by virtue of the interaction between Massachusetts' anti-discrimination law and Massachusetts' workers' compensation law. In other words, Mulloy contends that Chapter 152, &#167; 75B(1) entitles him to special treatment under Chapter 151B, &#167; 4 &#8212; treatment not recognized under the ADA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The meaning of Chapter 152, &#167; 75B(1) is unclear. The United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts has described the statute as a \"major exception to the traditional definition of a `handicapped person,'\" which expands the protection afforded by Chapter 151B to plaintiffs regardless of whether they can demonstrate substantial limitation of a major life activity. <i>See Gilman v. C &amp; S Wholesale Grocers, Inc.,</i> 170 F.Supp.2d 77, 85 (D.Mass.2001) (holding that a plaintiff who suffered a work-related injury and was capable of performing the essential functions of his job under Chapter 152, &#167; 75B(1) \"cannot be excluded as a matter of law, . . . from being a `qualified handicapped person' under chapter 151B\" &#8212; notwithstanding his inability to demonstrate substantial limitation of a major life activity).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the Supreme Judicial Court has declined to consider this issue, <i>see Dartt v.

While it remains unclear whether, by virtue of Chapter 152, &#167; 75B(1), a plaintiff can forego showing substantial limitation of a major life activity and still be deemed a \"qualified handicapped person\" under Chapter 151B, &#167; 4, one thing is clear: both Chapter 151B, &#167; 4 and Chapter 152, &#167; 75B(1) require that a plaintiff be \"capable of performing the essential functions of a particular job, or [] be capable of performing the essential functions of a particular job with reasonable accommodation.\" Mulloy argues that since \"the onset of [his] occupational asthma was work-related,\" he should be deemed a \"qualified handicapped person\" under Chapter 151B, &#167; 4 by virtue of Chapter 152, &#167; 75B(1). We disagree. Since Mulloy cannot show that he was capable of performing the essential functions of his job with or without reasonable accommodation, he is not a \"qualified handicapped person\" under Chapter 151B, &#167; 4. <i>See Poh v. Mass. Corr. Officers Federated Union,</i> No. 03-11987-RWZ, 2006 WL 1877089, at *4 (D.Mass.

Mulloy appeals from the entry of summary judgment for his former employer, Acushnet Company, in a suit alleging disability discrimination in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 12101-12213, and the Massachusetts anti-discrimination statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, &#167; 4. Mulloy contends that Acushnet failed to accommodate his disability when it refused to allow him to work from a remote location. The district court held that Mulloy was not a \"qualified individual with a disability\" under the ADA or a \"qualified handicapped person\" under Chapter 151B, &#167; 4. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following facts are undisputed except as otherwise noted. Acushnet, headquartered in Fairhaven, Massachusetts, manufactures and sells golf balls and other golf equipment and accessories. It has several manufacturing facilities, including a facility in Dartmouth, Massachusetts (\"Ball Plant II\"). In December of 1998, Acushnet hired Michael Mulloy as one of two electrical engineers at Ball Plant II.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The golf ball manufacturing process uses materials containing chemical sensitizers known as isocynates. The parties disagree as to the hazards of isocynate exposure: according to Acushnet, exposure to isocynates may exacerbate the symptoms of those with asthma, allergies, or chronic respiratory problems, while Mulloy believes isocynate exposure may cause these conditions. All of Acushnet's manufacturing facilities use isocynates. As a result, Acushnet has developed a formal isocynate protocol \"[t]o ensure the safe placement of any associate in an area with isocynate exposure and to provide ongoing medical monitoring post exposure to isocynates.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From December 1998 through January 2001, Mulloy designed programs for the golf ball manufacturing machines (governing their movement and timing); specified, purchased, and supervised the installation of electronic controls for new and modified equipment; evaluated machine capabilities and identified mechanical and electrical changes; trained and supported maintenance personnel to \"troubleshoot\" (i.e., respond to malfunctions with) electrical and electronic controls; supported electrical safety programs; and specified electrical services for new machines. During this period, Mulloy spent an average of two hours per day on the manufacturing floor, and another six hours per day in his cubicle away from the manufacturing floor. Some days, Mulloy spent all or a majority of his day on the plant floor. The parties disagree about whether Mulloy sometimes worked on the plant floor for a full week or more at a time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of his hire, Mulloy completed a medical history form, reporting that he had no allergies, was taking no medication, and had no prior exposure to isocynates. Nine months later, however, Mulloy began to experience throat and chest tightness and discomfort, and presented Acushnet with a note from his physician reporting these symptoms. Acushnet responded by taking steps under its isocynate protocol, which involved Mulloy's completion of an allergy questionnaire and his taking a pulmonary function test. Dr. Charles Lutton, Acushnet's occupational medicine consultant, examined Mulloy and referred him to a respiratory specialist, who noted no signs of isocynate sensitivity and cleared him to return to work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 9, 2000, while working in the paint spray room (where golf balls are spray painted), Mulloy began to feel dizzy. Over the next several days, he felt \"foggy and feverish.\" Acushnet kept Mulloy out of the paint spray room pending further pulmonary function testing and examination by Dr. Lutton. Dr. Lutton recommended that Mulloy not be exposed to isocynates or another respiratory irritant, CX-100. Accordingly, Mulloy was restricted from areas in the plant where these irritants are generated, known as \"red zones,\" and was reassigned to work on machines outside of the red zones on the other side of the building, in areas of the plant such as \"core molding\" (where the rubber cores of golf balls are made). When Mulloy needed to work on machines in the red zones, he did so remotely from the other side of the building by relying on other personnel to download his programs into these machines located in the restricted areas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This arrangement worked for over a year. However, beginning in November 2001, Mulloy began to experience dizziness and other symptoms while outside of the red zones. Dr. Lutton examined Mulloy and recommended that he be removed from all Acushnet buildings where isocynates were used. Accordingly, Acushnet transferred him to its headquarters in Fairhaven, Massachusetts, located fifteen miles away from Ball Plant II, where there is no manufacturing and no use of chemicals such as isocynates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties disagree about the extent to which Mulloy continued to perform his job functions in Fairhaven. Mulloy contends that he continued to perform all of his job functions in Fairhaven, and even received a positive job performance evaluation three months after his transfer. Acushnet contends that while Mulloy was able to perform some of the functions of his job, his inability to enter the plant prevented him from performing others. Following his transfer to Fairhaven, the Vice President of Employee Relations, Ken Riall, consulted with Acushnet's Vice President of Golf Ball Manufacturing, Eric Bartsch, and its Director of Health Safety and Field Services, Jean Sutherland, regarding what tasks Mulloy could perform and what accommodations could be made for his limitations. Riall specifically asked Bartsch whether Mulloy could perform his job remotely. Bartsh concluded that Mulloy could not. Riall did not consult with Kimberly Francis, the Director of Engineering at Ball Plant II and Mulloy's immediate supervisor. On January 10, 2002, Acushnet told Mulloy that his employment would be terminated effective March 4, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approximately 50% of the work that Mulloy used to perform is now done by Acushnet employees inside the plant. Due to a shortage of personnel, another 40% of the work Mulloy used to perform is handled by outside vendors, and the majority of this work (70%) is likewise performed inside the plant. A small percentage of the work (10%) that Mulloy used to perform has been designated low-priority by Acushnet and, therefore, is not being done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since his termination from Acushnet, Mulloy has been diagnosed with occupational asthma. The parties disagree about the extent of the limitations imposed by this diagnosis. Mulloy contends that he is \"permanently partially disabled\" and can work only in a \"meticulously clean work environment because exposure to dusts and numerous common chemical compounds . . . can trigger a respiratory attack.\" Acushnet argues that, based on the medical evidence, Mulloy need only avoid working in areas containing isocynates or other volatile chemicals. Mulloy also contends that he sustained emotional and psychological damage as a result of his termination which may preclude him from future employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For several years following his termination, Mulloy sought employment as an electrical engineer and also considered other job options such as teaching, to no avail. He eventually enrolled as a full-time student at Syracuse Law School. On May 28, 2003, Mulloy filed a complaint in the district court, alleging that Acushnet discriminated against him on the basis of his disability in violation of the ADA and Chapter 151B, &#167; 4. Acushnet subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment, which the district court granted.

They disagree about whether physical presence was required to perform these functions and was thereby, itself, an essential function of the job.

Acushnet produced voluminous evidence in the summary judgment record to challenge that proposition.

Employer's Judgment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Acushnet argues that, in the judgment of those most familiar with Mulloy's job functions, Mulloy's physical presence at Ball Plant II was an essential function of his job. Kimberly Francis, who was Acushnet's Director of Engineering and Mulloy's supervisor, stated that \"[t]o carry out the full responsibilities of the job, [Mulloy] was required to have interaction with the operator of the machine and the machine itself,\" which necessarily \"required entrance into the Ball Plant.\" Specifically, Francis stated that in order to troubleshoot, support electrical safety programs, lead investigations, and take corrective actions, Mulloy \"had to enter the plant floor, plug his computer into the system to access the program and observe how the machine was reacting to the program commands. . . . This task could not be efficiently performed from a remote location since many of the adjustments are time sensitive.\" According to Francis, \"[Mulloy] needed to be able to visually watch the equipment to be able to troubleshoot it.\" While he could \"see the controls operation\" from a remote location, he could not \"assess [] what the operator is doing, product quality, whether or not [the machine is] shooting balls in the air.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to design and program the machines, Francis stated that Mulloy \"had to work with technicians and other engineers on the plant floor . . . [and] enter the area with the machine to make adjustments and finalize the program. To fully perform this function, the engineer must have access to the machines.\" Francis stated that Mulloy also needed to be able to physically access the machines in order to perform manual adjustments on them and to fully perform the \"hands-on\" training function of his job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Francis stated that from May 2000 to November 2001, when Mulloy was restricted from accessing machines in the red zones, \"Mulloy was reassigned to machines outside of the red zone in the Ball Plant so that he could fully perform all of the necessary functions of the job. During this time, approximately eighty percent (80%) of his work was on machines located outside of the red zone.\" Mulloy continued to perform a small amount of work &#8212; presumably, approximately 20% &#8212; on machines inside the red zones, but relied on others physically to access the machines for him. When Mulloy was restricted from Ball Plant II, however, Francis stated that he no longer had \"regular[] access [to] the machines\" and the machine operators and, thus, \"was unable to perform the necessary responsibilities and functions of his job as a senior electrical engineer.\" Eric Bartsch, Acushnet's Vice President of Golf Ball Manufacturing, who had supervised Acushnet's electrical engineers during his eighteen years at Acushnet, also stated that \"Mr. Mulloy could not perform the necessary responsibilities and functions of the electrical engineering job from a remote location.\" According to Francis, Mulloy's job in Fairhaven consisted of \"finishing up\" the documentation of previous projects on which he worked in Ball Plant II. Francis stated that \"[Mulloy] was no longer assigned work that required access to the machines,\" and instead, \"[these] assignments were given to other engineers or technicians in the Ball Plant or to outside vendors.\" Bartsch similarly stated that after Mulloy was transferred to Fairhaven, \"his tasks were reprioritized and he was instructed to work on documentation and a few small tasks that did not require him to enter the Ball Plant.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not surprisingly, Mulloy rejects the views of his employer. Instead, he asserts that his physical presence in Ball Plant II was not required, and that he performed &#8212; and could have continued to perform &#8212; his essential job functions remotely from the Fairhaven facility. Mulloy presents five arguments challenging the judgment of his employer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) Mulloy's Familiarity With the Machines and Their Operators</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mulloy first offers his own testimony that he did not have to see the machines or those operating them in order to perform his job functions, given his \"long experience and familiarity with the programming, the machines, the electrical circuits, and the machine operators,\" and his ability to communicate with mechanical engineers and technicians on the manufacturing floor \"using telephone communications and remote computer technology.\" In light of the substantial weight we must accord Acushnet's view of Mulloy's job requirements, together with the wealth of authority recognizing physical attendance as an essential function of most jobs,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> we agree with the district court that Mulloy's own self-serving testimony that he could perform the essential functions of his job from Fairhaven \"is insufficient under Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c) to create a `genuine' issue of material fact concerning the essential functions of [his job].\" <i>Mason,</i> 357 F.3d at 1121; <i>see id.</i> at 1122 (\"We are reluctant to allow employees to define the essential functions of their positions based solely on their personal viewpoint and experience.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) Mulloy's Ability to Work On-Site but Outside of Red Zones</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mulloy points to his performance of the essential functions of his job on-site but outside of the red zones as evidence of his ability to work off-site. We find this comparison unavailing. Acushnet does not dispute that Mulloy performed the essential functions of his job when he was on-site.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> After being restricted from the red zones, Francis stated that 80% of Mulloy's work assignments were reallocated to machines located outside of the red zones. The other 20% of his work related to machines located within the red zones that did not require physical access. Francis stated that, with respect to those machines located in the red zones, Mulloy relied on another electrical engineer, Ken Souza, and one of Acushnet's electrical technicians, George Desrosiers, to access the restricted areas. Mulloy similarly testified that when he was restricted from the red zones, his focus shifted to problems in the non-restricted \"half of the plant,\" while Desrosiers \"switched places\" with him. In this way, Mulloy was able to perform the essential functions of his job while on-site, even though he was not able to access all of the manufacturing machines because some of them were located in the red zones.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Mulloy was transferred off-site, however, he could no longer access any of the manufacturing machines, including those outside of the red zones. As the district court stated, the fact that Mulloy may have been able to perform the essential functions of his job on-site despite \"not [being] able to see <i>some</i> of the machines upon which he directed work to be done . . . does not support an inference that he could adequately perform his job without being able to see <i>any</i> of the machines or be easily accessible to those working on them.\" <i>Mulloy,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1528208</span></span>, at *8. In short, Mulloy's ability to perform his job functions on-site has nothing to do with his ability to perform his job remotely and, therefore, does not support his argument that he could perform the essential functions of his job from Fairhaven.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) Francis' Positive Evaluation of Mulloy</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mulloy argues that Francis' positive evaluation of his work on February 19, 2002, more than two months after he was transferred to Fairhaven, demonstrates that he was able to perform the essential functions of his job remotely. We disagree. While the evaluation does not set forth the period of evaluation, it appears to be an annual evaluation based on the numerous work projects listed and its reference to \"last year's review.\" It is undisputed that after his transfer to the Fairhaven facility at the end of November 2001, Mulloy continued performing some of the tasks that he had performed at Ball Plant II for approximately one and a half months, until January 10, 2002, when Mulloy was asked to spend 90% of his time typing manuals and his projects were assigned to other engineers. Therefore, regardless of when the annual evaluation began, Mulloy's off-site work on Ball Plant II assignments comprised only one and a half months of the work reviewed in that evaluation period. Francis' positive evaluation of Mulloy's performance for the entire year thus provides inadequate support for Mulloy's argument that he could work remotely from Fairhaven. In fact, Francis states unequivocally in both her deposition testimony and affidavit that Mulloy could not work remotely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(4) Francis' Post-Termination Statements</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mulloy also argues that the district court should not have credited Francis' statements because Riall did not consult Francis prior to terminating Mulloy, and thus did not rely on the information that she provided in his decision to terminate. We disagree. Francis' statements mirror the conclusions of Bartsch who <i>was</i> consulted prior to Mulloy's termination and, therefore, corroborate Acushnet's basis for terminating him. The district court, therefore, did not err in considering this evidence. The district court likewise did not err in considering the statements of Bartsch, who \"ha[d] worked at Acushnet for eighteen (18) years,\" \"was knowledgeable of the necessary responsibilities and functions of the senior electrical engineering job at Ball Plant II,\" and who \"determined that Mr. Mulloy was unable to perform the necessary responsibilities and functions of the senior electrical engineer job from a remote location.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(5) Francis' Statements About Troubleshooting</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mulloy also argues that the district court erred in crediting Francis' statement that Mulloy needed to see the machines in order to troubleshoot them. Mulloy notes that the job description refers only to \"training and supporting maintenance personnel to troubleshoot.\" According to Mulloy, it is the maintenance personnel &#8212; not Mulloy &#8212; who need to be able to see the machines. Even if we ascribe this meaning to the words cited by Mulloy, Mulloy's argument is not significantly probative and, in all events, it is directly contradicted by other items in the record. In a second, more detailed job description not referenced by Mulloy, the duties of an electrical engineer include \"troubleshoot[ing] process-related issues using proven problem solving techniques\" as well as \"[t]rain[ing] and support[ing] maintenance personnel to troubleshoot.\" And in his Statement of Material Facts, Mulloy expressly agreed with Acushnet's list of job responsibilities, which included \"training and supporting maintenance personnel, [and] troubleshooting electrical and electronic controls,\" as well as with Acushnet's statement that Mulloy \"was responsible for troubleshooting and developing new equipment.\" The district court did not err in considering Francis' statements about troubleshooting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p>ii. Job Description</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Acushnet points to the job description for an electrical engineer at Acushnet in support of its argument that physical presence was an essential function. Among the essential functions listed in the job description are teamwork, troubleshooting, evaluating, and training and supporting &#8212; all of which imply some level of interaction with the machines and personnel at Ball Plant II. \"We are not persuaded the absence of [physical attendance] from the job description demonstrates th[at] function [was] non-essential. As commonsense suggests, [the employer] probably did not even consider informing its employees that they were actually required to show up at the workplace . . . when it drafted the [] job description &#8212; that is a given.\" <i>Mason,</i> 357 F.3d at 1122; <i>see also Kvorjak,</i> 259 F.3d at 57 n. 17 (holding that \"claims adjudicator's duties as advisor to other call center staff,\" which include troubleshooting, teamwork, and training staff members, \"demonstrate[] that the position cannot be performed at home\"); <i>id.</i> at 57 (\"Courts that have rejected working at home as a reasonable accommodation focus on evidence that personal contact, interaction, and coordination are needed for a specific position.\" (quoting <i>EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">33305876</span></span>, at *34 n. 93 (March 1, 1999)) (internal quotation marks omitted)); <i>Vande Zande,</i> 44 F.3d at 544 (\"Most jobs in organizations public or private involve team work under supervision rather than solitary unsupervised work, and team work under supervision generally cannot be performed at home without a substantial reduction in the quality of the employee's performance.\"). We therefore agree with Acushnet that the job description for an electrical engineer supports Acushnet's argument that Mulloy's physical presence was an essential function of his job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mulloy argues that since \"the job description specifies that the troubleshooting oversight function represents only 10% of Mulloy's overall responsibilities,\" troubleshooting is a \"marginal\" &#8212; not an \"essential\" &#8212; function. This argument also lacks merit. Mulloy explicitly states that the parties \"stipulated that the `essential functions' of Mulloy's former position as a senior electrical engineer in Acushnet's Ball Plant II are accurately represented in a company-drafted job description for Mulloy's position.\" This job description lists \"trouble-shooting\" as one of those functions. Mulloy cannot now claim that troubleshooting is only a marginal function. Even if Mulloy had not stipulated to the essential nature of this function, a job function requiring 10% of Mulloy's time is not insignificant when considered in relation to the five remaining essential functions of his job, each of which requires only 10% to 25% of his time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p>iii.

As the district court stated, \"Mulloy has no testimony from other former and current employees &#8212; and in particular, from the other senior electrical engineer at Acushnet &#8212; to substantiate his view of the essential duties of his position.\" <i>Mulloy,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1528208</span></span>, at *8; <i>see id.</i> (\"Appellant could have, but did not, depose current claims adjudicators about their duties.\" (quoting <i>Kvorjak,</i> 259 F.3d at 58) (internal quotation marks omitted)). The absence of such evidence, together with Francis' testimony that she was not aware of any electrical engineer working out of Fairhaven, supports Acushnet's argument that physical presence was an essential function of Mulloy's job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The experience of those who have taken over Mulloy's job functions since his termination also supports the conclusion that the job cannot be performed remotely. It is undisputed that over 70% of Mulloy's former job functions are performed in Ball Plant II by either employees or outside vendors. Based on the work experience of past and current employees, Mulloy has failed to present an adequate basis to challenge the company's contention that his physical presence was an essential function of his job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p>b.

It is well established that, while a reasonable accommodation may include job restructuring, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12111(9)(B), \"[t]he law does not require an employer to accommodate a disability by foregoing an essential function of the position or by reallocating essential functions to make other workers' jobs more onerous.\" <i>Kvorjak,</i> 259 F.3d at 57 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted); <i>see also Mason,</i> 357 F.3d at 1124 (\"[A] request to work at home is unreasonable if it eliminates an essential function of the job.\"); <i>Phelps,</i> 251 F.3d at 26 (\"Although a reasonable accommodation may include job restructuring, an employer need not exempt an employee from performing essential functions, nor need it reallocate essential functions to other employees.\" (internal citation and quotation marks omitted)). Here, Mulloy requests an accommodation which would prevent him from performing an essential function of his job, namely, being physically present at Ball Plant II.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court stated, Mulloy's request to work from Fairhaven \"in essence requires not an accommodation but a redefinition of his job.\" <i>Mulloy,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1528208</span></span>, at *10.

Mulloy's proposed accommodation is therefore per se unreasonable. <i>See Mason,</i> 357 F.3d at 1124 (\"[Employee's] request for an at-home accommodation is unreasonable on its face because it seeks to eliminate an essential function of [employment] position.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> The district court did not err in concluding that Mulloy's proposed accommodation was unreasonable, and that he thus was not a \"qualified individual with a disability\" under the ADA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D.
