Juan M. Pérez-Giménez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                         Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                    Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                      and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Edelmiro   Salas González, with whom José Luis Ramírez de León\nwas on brief,   for appellant.\n     Ramon L.   Walker Merino, with whom Walker Merino Law Office was\non brief, for   appellees.\n\n\n\n                            August 4, 2005\n\f          Per     Curiam.    These     appeals    involve   a   copyright\n\ninfringement claim stemming from a dispute over commercial graphic\n\nimages produced by appellant under a contract with appellee Adcom.\n\nThe parties had litigated the ownership of the images themselves in\n\nthe Puerto Rico Circuit Court of Appeals.        That court held that, as\n\na matter of Puerto Rico law, the actual images belonged to Adcom.\n\nAppellant then obtained a copyright to the images and brought this\n\nfederal action.    The district court found that, under the doctrine\n\nof res judicata, the federal action was precluded by the earlier\n\nPuerto Rico court judgment, and granted summary judgment for the\n\ndefendant. That ruling was erroneous. Res judicata does not apply\n\nbecause the Puerto Rico court did not have (and did not purport to\n\nhave) jurisdiction over any potential federal copyright claims. We\n\ntherefore vacate the judgment.\n\n          We also address an issue concerning our local appellate\n\nrules relating to the need for English translations of the Puerto\n\nRico court decisions relied upon by the parties. While those rules\n\nwere not complied with in this case, we find that sanctions are not\n\nappropriate given all the circumstances of the proceedings.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          Frank Gener-Villar (\"Gener\") is a graphic artist.            He\n\ncontracted with Adcom, an advertising agency, to prepare images and\n\nadvertising and promotional materials to use in Adcom's ads for its\n\nclients, including Supermercados Mr. Special.        The photographs and\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fdigital images were stored on computers owned by Gener but located\n\nat Adcom facilities. The contract did not specify who retained the\n\ncopyright to the images.\n\n              On February 22, 2000, Adcom terminated the contract and\n\ndemanded that Gener turn over the images.          He refused, and Adcom\n\nseized his computers.         Gener then filed a \"grievance\" before a\n\nmagistrate in the Investigations section of the San Juan Judiciary\n\nCenter, seeking a provisional adjudication of the dispute under 32\n\nP.R.       Laws   Ann.   §§   2871-2877    (authorizing     magistrates   to\n\nprovisionally decide certain controversies).              The court ordered\n\nthat the disputed images be removed from Gener's computers, copied\n\nto diskettes, and deposited with the court under seal pending\n\nlitigation over the ownership of the images.\n\n              Adcom filed an action in the Puerto Rico Court of First\n\nInstance, seeking, inter alia, a declaration that it was the owner\n\nof the works contained on the disk on the basis of its contract\n\nwith Gener.       Adcom also argued that it held the copyright to the\n\nimages under the doctrine of a \"work made for hire.\"          See 17 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 101, 201(b).1         Gener responded that Adcom's claim was for\n\n\n       1\n      The difference between ownership of the images themselves and\nthe ownership of the copyright to the images is essentially the\ndifference between owning the physical object and owning the\nintellectual property rights underlying it. \"Ownership of a\ncopyright . . . is distinct from ownership of any material object\nin which the work is embodied.      Transfer of ownership of any\nmaterial object, including the copy . . . in which the work is\nfirst fixed, does not of itself convey any rights in the\ncopyrighted work embodied in the object . . . .\" 17 U.S.C. § 202.\n\n                                     -3-\n\feconomic rights deriving from the images, and thus the Puerto Rico\n\nlaw claim was preempted by federal copyright law and the Puerto\n\nRico   court    lacked   jurisdiction.     See   17   U.S.C.    §   301(a)\n\n(preemption); 28 U.S.C. § 1338(a) (exclusive federal jurisdiction).\n\n           We pause to explain this jurisdictional issue because it\n\nis central to understanding both how the Puerto Rico courts viewed\n\nthe case and how we apply the doctrine of res judicata.             If an\n\naction \"aris[es] under\" federal copyright law, the federal courts\n\nhave exclusive jurisdiction.      28 U.S.C. § 1338(a).         Determining\n\nprecisely which actions \"arise under\" copyright law, and therefore\n\nfall   within   exclusive   federal   jurisdiction,   \"poses    among   the\n\nknottiest procedural problems in copyright jurisprudence.\" 3-12 M.\n\nNimmer & D. Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright § 12.01[A] (2001).               In\n\nRoyal v. Leading Edge Prods., Inc., 833 F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1987), we\n\nexplained:\n\n           It is settled beyond peradventure that an\n           action does not \"arise under\" the federal\n           copyright laws merely because it relates to a\n           product that is the subject of a copyright.\n           The question of whether the suit \"arises\n           under\" the copyright law is considerably more\n           sophisticated. The most frequently cited test\n           is that formulated by the Second Circuit,\n           along the lines that:\n\n                   an action \"arises under\" the\n                   Copyright Act if and only if the\n\n\nFor example, a collector who buys a painting from an artist may\nhang it in his house or sell it to a third party. However, the\ncollector does not acquire, solely by buying the painting, the\nright to make and distribute prints of it.\n\n                                  -4-\n\f                   complaint    is  for   a  remedy\n                   expressly granted by the Act,\n                   e.g., a suit for infringement\n                   . . ., or asserts a claim\n                   requiring construction of the\n                   Act, . . ., or, at the very\n                   least     and    perhaps    more\n                   doubtfully, presents a case\n                   where a distinctive policy of\n                   the Act requires that federal\n                   principles      control      the\n                   disposition of the claim. The\n                   general       interest     that\n                   copyrights, like all other forms\n                   of property, should be enjoyed\n                   by their true owner is not\n                   enough to meet this last test.\n\nId. at 2 (quoting T.B. Harms Co. v. Eliscu, 339 F.2d 823, 828 (2d\n\nCir.   1964)   (Friendly,   J.))   (citation   omitted;   alterations   in\n\noriginal).\n\n           The Court of First Instance hypothesized that if Adcom\n\nindeed held the copyright to the images pursuant to the \"work made\n\nfor hire\" doctrine, Adcom's copyright-based ownership claim would\n\narise under copyright law and the entire case would be outside the\n\njurisdiction of the Puerto Rico courts.        Conversely, if Adcom did\n\nnot hold the copyright to the images under that doctrine, the\n\ncontractual claim over the images themselves would not be preempted\n\nand the court would have jurisdiction to decide it.            See Adcom\n\nGroup, Inc. v. Gener, No. KPE-00-0640, slip op. at 7-8, 14 (P.R.\n\nCt. of First Instance May 4, 2000) (certified translation) (\"Adcom\n\nI\").\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f          Thus, the Puerto Rico trial court began its analysis by\n\ndetermining whether Adcom held the copyright under the \"work made\n\nfor hire\" doctrine. The court concluded that, because Gener was an\n\nindependent contractor and the images at issue did not fall into\n\ncertain specific categories, the images did not constitute \"work\n\nmade for hire\" under federal copyright law.   See Adcom I at 12-14.2\n\nIt did, however, credit Adcom's contractual argument, and held that\n\n\"all the graphic artworks commissioned by [Adcom] from [Gener]\n\nduring the effective period of the contract belong to [Adcom].\"\n\nId. at 22.\n\n          The court was careful to emphasize the limited nature of\n\nits holding.   In response to Gener's argument that Adcom's claim\n\nfell within exclusive federal jurisdiction, the court explained\n\nthat the action (as narrowed and construed by the court) did not\n\narise under federal copyright law because it was \"not based on a\n\nclaim for an author's economic rights, but on the delivery of a\n\ncomputer disk over which[] [Adcom] alleges having an ownership\n\nright due to having paid for the information contained in it.\"   Id.\n\nat 19.   The court emphasized this point again towards the end of\n\nits opinion:\n\n          [W]e are not adjudicating the possible\n          intellectual original ownership which [Gener]\n          may have with regard to the works in\n\n\n     2\n      It also discussed the Puerto Rico intellectual property\ndoctrine of \"moral rights,\" which is not at issue here and which we\nwill not discuss further.\n\n                               -6-\n\f           controversy . . . .    What we are saying is\n           that [Gener], by means of a contract,\n           transmitted to [Adcom] the graphic artworks\n           requested in exchange for a payment, with\n           [Adcom] then becoming the owner of the same.\n\nId. at 23.\n\n           Gener appealed to the Puerto Rico Circuit Court of\n\nAppeals.   That court largely repeated the trial court's reasoning.\n\nSee Adcom Group, Inc. v. Gener, No. KLAN-00-00775 (P.R. Ct. App.\n\nMar. 30, 2001) (certified translation) (\"Adcom II\").        After an\n\nextensive analysis, it concluded that the \"work made for hire\"\n\ndoctrine did not apply, and that the Puerto Rico courts had\n\njurisdiction over the suit.   See id. at 10-11.   It agreed with the\n\ntrial court's analysis that the suit concerned ownership of the\n\nactual images, not intellectual property rights:\n\n           As was correctly pointed out by the judge from\n           the [trial court], we don't have before us a\n           claim for an author's patrimonial rights, but\n           a claim for the delivery of a computer\n           diskette over which [Adcom] alleges having\n           rights due to having paid for the information\n           contained in it.\n\nId. at 13.     Finally, it affirmed the trial court's ultimate\n\ndetermination that \"the work performed by [Gener], by virtue of his\n\ncontract with [Adcom], belongs to the latter.\"    Id. at 14.3\n\n           That summer, Gener applied for a copyright to the images.\n\nIn March 2003, he filed a federal copyright infringement action in\n\n\n     3\n      Although the record is not clear, it appears that Gener\nsought further review in the Puerto Rico Supreme Court, which\ndeclined to review the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n                                -7-\n\fthe United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico\n\nagainst Adcom, Supermercados Mr. Special, and their respective\n\npresidents.4    The defendants asserted a long list of affirmative\n\ndefenses, most notably res judicata, and moved for summary judgment\n\non numerous grounds, focusing mainly on res judicata.               Gener\n\nresponded, in part, that the Puerto Rico and federal claims lacked\n\nsufficient identity because the Puerto Rico courts could not (and\n\ndid not purport to) resolve any federal copyright questions.          In\n\nGener's view, the Puerto Rico court's discussion of the \"work made\n\nfor hire\" doctrine was solely for the purpose of determining\n\nwhether its jurisdiction was preempted or not.\n\n          The   district   court   granted   the   motion   for   summary\n\njudgment on the grounds of res judicata. It noted Gener's argument\n\nthat the Puerto Rico court lacked jurisdiction to determine who had\n\nthe copyright to the images, but explained:\n\n          [T]he state court did properly exercise its\n          authority to interpret the terms of the\n          contract and determine that the suit did not\n          involve copyright law.    In fact, the state\n          court described at length why it did not\n          believe copyright law applied to Plaintiff's\n          claims.   Thus, the state court was able to\n          establish jurisdiction and determine the\n          ownership issue relying solely on the contract\n          between the parties.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      Purely for simplicity and brevity, we refer to defendants-\nappellees collectively as \"Adcom,\" in part because the non-Adcom\nparties presented no independent argument for summary judgment\nbelow but rather simply joined in Adcom's motion.\n\n                                   -8-\n\fGener-Villar v. Adcom Group, Inc., No. 03-1306, slip op. at 3\n\n(D.P.R. June 29, 2004).           It dismissed the action with prejudice.\n\nGener moved to alter or amend the judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n59(e), repeating his argument that the Puerto Rico court only\n\nadjudicated ownership of the images themselves and not of the\n\nintellectual property rights thereto, but the district court denied\n\nthe motion.      Gener then timely appealed.\n\n                                        II.\n\n           We review a district court's grant of summary judgment de\n\nnovo.   Burke v. Town of Walpole, 405 F.3d 66, 75 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nThe   district    court's     sole    stated   basis    for   granting   summary\n\njudgment for defendants was res judicata.                Since federal courts\n\naccord a Puerto Rico judgment the same preclusive effect as would\n\na Puerto Rico court, see 28 U.S.C. § 1738, we apply Puerto Rico res\n\njudicata law.\n\n           In Puerto Rico, as in most jurisdictions, the term \"res\n\njudicata\" is often used to refer to either of two distinct but\n\nrelated doctrines.       The first doctrine (known variously as claim\n\npreclusion, merger and bar doctrine, or simply res judicata)\n\n\"generally    binds     parties    from   litigating     or   relitigating    any\n\n[claim]   that    was    or   could    have    been    litigated   in    a   prior\n\nadjudication and prevents claim splitting.\"              Futura Dev. Corp. v.\n\nCentex Corp., 761 F.2d 33, 42 (1st Cir. 1985).             The second doctrine\n\n(known as issue preclusion or collateral estoppel) \"forecloses\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\frelitigation   in   a   subsequent    action   of     a   fact     essential   for\n\nrendering a judgment in a prior action between the same parties,\n\neven when different causes of action are involved.\"                 Texaco P.R.,\n\nInc. v. Medina, 834 F.2d 242, 245 (1st Cir. 1987).                  The district\n\ncourt based its analysis entirely on claim preclusion, and the\n\nparties do the same on appeal.       Consequently, so do we.           See Fleet\n\nNat'l Bank v. Gray (In re Bankvest Capital Corp.), 375 F.3d 51,\n\n69-70 (1st Cir. 2004) (analyzing only the branch of res judicata\n\ndoctrine argued by the parties).\n\n          Puerto Rico accords claim preclusive effect to a prior\n\ndecision when \"between the case decided by the sentence and that in\n\nwhich the same is invoked, there [is] the most perfect identity\n\nbetween the things, causes, and persons of the litigants, and their\n\ncapacity as such.\"       31 P.R. Laws Ann. § 3343.                 While \"courts\n\ntypically have refrained from interpreting the phrase 'perfect\n\nidentity' literally\" and \"nominal differences between two actions\n\n[do not] undermine the preclusive effect of a commonwealth court\n\nruling,\" Cruz v. Melecio, 204 F.3d 14, 19 (1st Cir. 2000), genuine\n\ndifferences    between     two   actions       will       defeat     preclusion.\n\nFurthermore, a decision has claim preclusive effect only if it was\n\n\"rendered by a court with proper jurisdiction.\"                  Felix Davis v.\n\nVieques Air Link, 892 F.2d 1122, 1124 (1st Cir. 1990).                     Gener\n\nchallenges the identity of the Puerto Rico and federal actions,\n\narguing that the Puerto Rico action did not arise under federal\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fcopyright law, and he could not have brought the present copyright\n\ninfringement action in the Puerto Rico court because, under 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1338(a), the Puerto Rico court would have lacked subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction.\n\n                We agree.       The Circuit Court of Appeals specifically\n\nconstrued Adcom's Puerto Rico action as arising under Puerto Rico\n\nlaw.       It carefully emphasized that the case was not \"a claim for an\n\nauthor's patrimonial rights, but a claim for the delivery of a\n\ncomputer diskette.\"           Adcom II at 13.           It quoted approvingly the\n\ntrial court's statement that \"'[w]e are dealing with a controversy\n\nof     a    contractual       nature    for     which       this   Court     does    have\n\njurisdiction.'\"         Id. (quoting Adcom I at 19); see also Adcom I at\n\n23   (repeating        that   court     was    \"not    adjudicating     the    possible\n\nintellectual original ownership which [Gener] may have with regard\n\nto the works in controversy\").\n\n               To be sure, Adcom argued in the Puerto Rico court that\n\n\"it has a right over the information in controversy in light of the\n\ndoctrine       of   work   made   for    hire,\"       and   the    Puerto    Rico   court\n\nexpressly concluded that the work made for hire doctrine did not\n\nentitle Adcom to the copyright to the images.                      Adcom II at 7, 10.\n\nBut the entire purpose of that discussion was to illustrate that\n\nAdcom's contractual claims were separate from any copyright issues\n\nand were within the Puerto Rico courts' jurisdiction.                               As we\n\nunderstand       it,   the    Puerto    Rico    court's      \"work    made    for   hire\"\n\n\n                                          -11-\n\fanalysis was solely for the purpose of determining whether the\n\nPuerto Rico court had jurisdiction or not.     The court discussed\n\nthat doctrine to explain why Adcom's complaint did not arise under\n\ncopyright law, which might have caused the entire action to fall\n\nunder exclusive federal jurisdiction.5   Gener's argument that the\n\nentire case should be dismissed because it arose under federal\n\ncopyright law did not actually transform the case into one that\n\narose under federal copyright law; rather, the Puerto Rico court\n\ncarefully separated out the Puerto Rico law claims and adjudicated\n\nonly those claims.\n\n          Indeed, Adcom never clearly explains what either was, or\n\nshould have been, litigated or decided in the Puerto Rico courts\n\nwith preclusive effect in this case.     If Adcom means that the\n\nentire dispute should have been aired before the Puerto Rico court,\n\nand any claims that could have been (but were not) raised in the\n\nPuerto Rico court are barred, the argument fails because Gener's\n\ninfringement claim could not have been raised in the Puerto Rico\n\ncourt:\n\n          [C]laim preclusion generally does not apply\n          where [the] plaintiff was unable to rely on a\n          certain theory of the case or to seek a\n          certain remedy because of the limitations on\n          the subject matter jurisdiction of the courts\n          . . . . If state preclusion law includes this\n\n\n     5\n      We need not decide whether the Puerto Rico court's analysis\nof federal copyright preemption law was precisely correct because,\nin any event, the Puerto Rico court viewed its jurisdiction as\nlimited to Puerto Rico law claims.\n\n                               -12-\n\f           requirement of prior jurisdictional competency\n           . . . a state judgment will not have claim\n           preclusive effect on a cause of action within\n           the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal\n           courts.\n\nMarrese v.

Consequently, the other issues that Adcom argued below\n\nare not properly before us in these appeals, and it would be\n\ninappropriate to reach them.           Cf. United States v. Moran, 393 F.3d\n\n1, 12 (1st Cir. 2004) (in certain circumstances, an appellee must\n\nraise alternative bases for affirming a favorable judgment or risk\n\nwaiver). Accordingly, we vacate the judgment on the basis that res\n\njudicata does not bar the action, without expressing any view on\n\nwhether either party might eventually be entitled to summary\n\njudgment on other grounds.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\f                                      III.\n\n             We   think   it   appropriate,     to   forestall   unnecessary\n\ndifficulties in future appeals, to address an issue involving our\n\nown rules and our need for English translations of Puerto Rico\n\ncourt decisions relied on by the parties.\n\n             Very briefly, summary judgment was ordered for Adcom on\n\nthe basis of Puerto Rico court decisions that were submitted to the\n\ndistrict court in Spanish.           Gener filed a motion requesting the\n\ncourt   to   order   Adcom     to   file   English   translations   of   these\n\ndecisions for the purpose of compiling an appellate record, but the\n\nmotion was denied.        The impact of the Puerto Rico decisions was\n\ncritical to our review on appeal, and we therefore ordered Adcom to\n\nproduce certified translations of them.\n\n             Our rules require that such translations be part of the\n\nrecord on appeal for the very reason that we were obliged to order\n\ntheir submission; we cannot effectively review a judgment that\n\nrelies on non-English materials.             Under these rules, \"[i]f an\n\nunpublished . . . opinion of another court is cited\" by a party for\n\nan authorized purpose, including \"support [of] a claim of res\n\njudicata,\" \"a copy of the opinion or disposition must be included\n\nin an accompanying addendum or appendix.\"              lst Cir. R. 32.3(b),\n\n(a)(1), (a)(3).      If that decision is not in English, another local\n\nrule specifies that \"[t]he court will not receive documents not in\n\n\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fthe English language unless translations are furnished.\"             lst Cir.\n\nR. 30(d).\n\n            Although we have made clear that the parties may not\n\ndisregard such rules with impunity, see Deniz v. Municipality of\n\nGuaynabo, 285 F.3d 142, 148 (lst Cir. 2002), we do not feel that\n\nthis is a situation calling for sanctions.          Understandably, but\n\nunfortunately, the focus of court and parties in dealing with\n\nGener's motion was on precedent and argument concerning the need to\n\nprovide translations of non-English evidence.        Gener's motion and\n\nAdcom's opposition were framed in these terms.            In this context,\n\nthe   district   court   may   have   concluded    that     the    requested\n\ntranslations were non-evidentiary materials and thus outside that\n\nprecedent, overlooking counsel's separate obligation to provide the\n\nappellate court with translations of unpublished court decisions\n\nsupporting the claim of res judicata.\n\n            Adcom points out that it was never ordered to submit a\n\ntranslation, and Gener, while vigorously arguing as we have noted,\n\ndid not invoke the rules explicitly requiring such translations.\n\nNor did Gener seek from us an order for translations with extended\n\ntime for briefing.       All things considered, we deem sanctions\n\ninappropriate here.\n\n            Judgment   vacated.   Remanded   for   further        proceedings\n\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\f",

The parties had litigated the ownership of the images themselves in the Puerto Rico Circuit Court of Appeals. That court held that, as a matter of Puerto Rico law, the actual images belonged to Adcom. Appellant then obtained a copyright to the images and brought this federal action. The district court found that, under the doctrine of res judicata, the federal action was precluded by the earlier Puerto Rico court judgment, and granted summary judgment for the defendant. That ruling was erroneous. Res judicata does not apply because the Puerto Rico court did not have (and did not purport to have) jurisdiction over any potential federal copyright claims. We therefore vacate the judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also address an issue concerning our local appellate rules relating to the need for English translations of the Puerto Rico court decisions relied upon by the parties.

He contracted with Adcom, an advertising agency, to prepare images and advertising and promotional materials to use in Adcom's ads for its clients, including Supermercados Mr. Special. The photographs and digital images were stored on computers owned by Gener but located at Adcom facilities. The contract did not specify who retained the copyright to the images.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 22, 2000, Adcom terminated the contract and demanded that Gener turn over the images. He refused, and Adcom seized his computers. Gener then filed a \"grievance\" before a magistrate in the Investigations section of the San Juan Judiciary Center, seeking a provisional adjudication of the dispute under 32 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167;&#167; 2871-2877 (authorizing magistrates to provisionally decide certain controversies). The court ordered that the disputed images be removed from Gener's computers, copied to diskettes, and deposited with the court under seal pending litigation over the ownership of the images.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Adcom filed an action in the Puerto Rico Court of First Instance, seeking, <i>inter alia,</i> a declaration that it was the owner of the works contained on the disk on the basis of its contract with Gener. Adcom also argued that it held the copyright to the images under the doctrine of a \"work made for hire.\" <i>See</i> 17 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 101, 201(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Gener responded that Adcom's claim was for economic rights deriving from the images, and thus the Puerto Rico law claim was preempted by federal copyright law and the Puerto Rico court lacked jurisdiction. <i>See</i> 17 U.S.C. &#167; 301(a) (preemption); 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1338(a) (exclusive federal jurisdiction).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We pause to explain this jurisdictional issue because it is central to understanding both how the Puerto Rico courts viewed the case and how we apply the doctrine of res judicata. If an action \"aris[es] under\" federal copyright law, the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1338(a). Determining precisely which actions \"arise under\" copyright law, and therefore fall within exclusive federal jurisdiction, \"poses among the knottiest procedural problems in copyright jurisprudence.\" 3-12 M. Nimmer &amp; D. Nimmer, <i>Nimmer on Copyright</i> &#167; 12.01[A] (2001). In <i>Royal v. Leading Edge Prods., Inc.,</i> 833 F.2d 1 (1st Cir.1987), we explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is settled beyond peradventure that an action does not \"arise under\" the federal copyright laws merely because it relates to a product that is the subject of a copyright. The question of whether the suit \"arises under\" the copyright law is considerably more sophisticated. The most frequently cited test is that formulated by the Second Circuit, along the lines that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">an action \"arises under\" the Copyright Act if and only if the complaint is for a remedy expressly granted by the Act, e.g., a suit for infringement. . ., or asserts a claim requiring construction of the Act, . . ., or, at the very least and perhaps more doubtfully, presents a case where a distinctive policy of the Act requires that federal principles control the disposition of the claim. The general interest that copyrights, like all other forms of property, should be enjoyed by their true owner is not enough to meet this last test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 2 (quoting <i>T.B. Harms Co. v. Eliscu,</i> 339 F.2d 823, 828 (2d Cir.1964) (Friendly, J.)) (citation omitted; alterations in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court of First Instance hypothesized that if Adcom indeed held the copyright to the images pursuant to the \"work made for hire\" doctrine, Adcom's copyright-based ownership claim would arise under copyright law and the entire case would be outside the jurisdiction of the Puerto Rico courts. Conversely, if Adcom did <i>not</i> hold the copyright to the images under that doctrine, the contractual claim over the images themselves would not be preempted and the court would have jurisdiction to decide it. <i>See Adcom Group, Inc. v. Gener,</i> No. KPE-00-0640, slip op. at 7-8, 14 (P.R. Ct. of First Instance May 4, 2000) (certified translation) (\"<i>Adcom I</i>\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the Puerto Rico trial court began its analysis by determining whether Adcom held the copyright under the \"work made for hire\" doctrine. The court concluded that, because Gener was an independent contractor and the images at issue did not fall into certain specific categories, the images did not constitute \"work made for hire\" under federal copyright law. <i>See Adcom I</i> at 12-14.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> It did, however, credit Adcom's contractual argument, and held that \"all the graphic artworks commissioned by [Adcom] from [Gener] during the effective period of the contract belong to [Adcom].\" <i>Id.</i> at 22.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court was careful to emphasize the limited nature of its holding. In response to Gener's argument that Adcom's claim fell within exclusive federal jurisdiction, the court explained that the action (as narrowed and construed by the court) did not arise under federal copyright law because it was \"not based on a claim for an author's economic rights, but on the delivery of a computer disk over which[] [Adcom] alleges having an ownership right due to having paid for the information contained in it.\" <i>Id.</i> at 19. The court emphasized this point again towards the end of its opinion:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[W]e are not adjudicating the possible intellectual original ownership which [Gener] may have with regard to the works in controversy.... What we are saying is that [Gener], by means of a contract, transmitted to [Adcom] the graphic artworks requested in exchange for a payment, with [Adcom] then becoming the owner of the same.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 23.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gener appealed to the Puerto Rico Circuit Court of Appeals. That court largely repeated the trial court's reasoning. <i>See Adcom Group, Inc. v. Gener,</i> No. KLAN-00-00775 (P.R. Ct.App. Mar. 30, 2001) (certified translation) (\"<i>Adcom II</i>\"). After an extensive analysis, it concluded that the \"work made for hire\" doctrine did not apply, and that the Puerto Rico courts had jurisdiction over the suit. <i>See id.</i> at 10-11. It agreed with the trial court's analysis that the suit concerned ownership of the actual images, not intellectual property rights:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As was correctly pointed out by the judge from the [trial court], we don't have before us a claim for an author's patrimonial rights, but a claim for the delivery of a computer diskette over which [Adcom] alleges having rights due to having paid for the information contained in it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 13. Finally, it affirmed the trial court's ultimate determination that \"the work performed by [Gener], by virtue of his contract with [Adcom], belongs to the latter.\" <i>Id.</i> at 14.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That summer, Gener applied for a copyright to the images. In March 2003, he filed a federal copyright infringement action in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico against Adcom, Supermercados Mr. Special, and their respective presidents.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The defendants asserted a long list of affirmative defenses, most notably res judicata, and moved for summary judgment on numerous grounds, focusing mainly on res judicata. Gener responded, in part, that the Puerto Rico and federal claims lacked sufficient identity because the Puerto Rico courts could not (and did not purport to) resolve any federal copyright questions. In Gener's view, the Puerto Rico court's discussion of the \"work made for hire\" doctrine was solely for the purpose of determining whether its jurisdiction was preempted or not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted the motion for summary judgment on the grounds of res judicata. It noted Gener's argument that the Puerto Rico court lacked jurisdiction to determine who had the copyright to the images, but explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he state court did properly exercise its authority to interpret the terms of the contract and determine that the suit did not involve copyright law. In fact, the state court described at length why it did not believe copyright law applied to Plaintiff's claims. Thus, the state court was able to establish jurisdiction and determine the ownership issue relying solely on the contract between the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Gener-Villar v. Adcom Group, Inc.,</i> No. 03-1306, slip op. at 3 (D.P.R. June 29, 2004). It dismissed the action with prejudice. Gener moved to alter or amend the judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e), repeating his argument that the Puerto Rico court only adjudicated ownership of the images themselves and not of the intellectual property rights thereto, but the district court denied the motion. Gener then timely appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's grant of summary judgment <i>de novo. Burke v. Town of Walpole,</i> 405 F.3d 66, 75 (1st Cir.2005). The district court's sole stated basis for granting summary judgment for defendants was res judicata. Since federal courts accord a Puerto Rico judgment the same preclusive effect as would a Puerto Rico court, <i>see</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1738, we apply Puerto Rico res judicata law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Puerto Rico, as in most jurisdictions, the term \"res judicata\" is often used to refer to either of two distinct but related doctrines. The first doctrine (known variously as claim preclusion, merger and bar doctrine, or simply res judicata) \"generally binds parties from litigating or relitigating any [claim] that was or could have been litigated in a prior adjudication and prevents claim splitting.\" <i>Futura Dev. Corp. v. Centex Corp.,</i> 761 F.2d 33, 42 (1st Cir. 1985). The second doctrine (known as issue preclusion or collateral estoppel) \"fore-closes relitigation in a subsequent action of a fact essential for rendering a judgment in a prior action between the same parties, even when different causes of action are involved.\" <i>Texaco P.R., Inc. v. Medina,</i> 834 F.2d 242, 245 (1st Cir.1987). The district court based its analysis entirely on claim preclusion, and the parties do the same on appeal. Consequently, so do we. <i>See Fleet Nat'l Bank v. Gray</i> (<i>In re Bankvest Capital Corp.</i>), 375 F.3d 51, 69-70 (1st Cir.2004) (analyzing only the branch of res judicata doctrine argued by the parties).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Puerto Rico accords claim preclusive effect to a prior decision when \"between the case decided by the sentence and that in which the same is invoked, there [is] the most perfect identity between the things, causes, and persons of the litigants, and their capacity as such.\" 31 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 3343. While \"courts typically have refrained from interpreting the phrase `perfect identity' literally\" and \"nominal differences between two actions [do not] undermine the preclusive effect of a commonwealth court ruling,\" <i>Cruz v. Melecio,</i> 204 F.3d 14, 19 (1st Cir.2000), genuine differences between two actions will defeat preclusion. Furthermore, a decision has claim preclusive effect only if it was \"rendered by a court with proper jurisdiction.\" <i>Felix Davis v. Vieques Air Link,</i> 892 F.2d 1122, 1124 (1st Cir.1990). Gener challenges the identity of the Puerto Rico and federal actions, arguing that the Puerto Rico action did not arise under federal copyright law, and he could not have brought the present copyright infringement action in the Puerto Rico court because, under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1338(a), the Puerto Rico court would have lacked subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree. The Circuit Court of Appeals specifically construed Adcom's Puerto Rico action as arising under Puerto Rico law. It carefully emphasized that the case was not \"a claim for an author's patrimonial rights, but a claim for the delivery of a computer diskette.\" <i>Adcom II</i> at 13. It quoted approvingly the trial court's statement that \"`[w]e are dealing with a controversy of a contractual nature for which this Court does have jurisdiction.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Adcom I</i> at 19); <i>see also Adcom I</i> at 23 (repeating that court was \"not adjudicating the possible intellectual original ownership which [Gener] may have with regard to the works in controversy\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, Adcom argued in the Puerto Rico court that \"it has a right over the information in controversy in light of the doctrine of work made for hire,\" and the Puerto Rico court expressly concluded that the work made for hire doctrine did not entitle Adcom to the copyright to the images. <i>Adcom II</i> at 7, 10. But the entire purpose of that discussion was to illustrate that Adcom's contractual claims were separate from any copyright issues and were within the Puerto Rico courts' jurisdiction. As we understand it, the Puerto Rico court's \"work made for hire\" analysis was solely for the purpose of determining whether the Puerto Rico court had jurisdiction or not. The court discussed that doctrine to explain why Adcom's complaint did not arise under copyright law, which might have caused the entire action to fall under exclusive federal jurisdiction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Gener's argument that the entire case should be dismissed because it arose under federal copyright law did not actually transform the case into one that arose under federal copyright law; rather, the Puerto Rico court carefully separated out the Puerto Rico law claims and adjudicated only those claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, Adcom never clearly explains what either was, or should have been, litigated or decided in the Puerto Rico courts with preclusive effect in this case. If Adcom means that the entire dispute should have been aired before the Puerto Rico court, and any claims that could have been (but were not) raised in the Puerto Rico court are barred, the argument fails because Gener's infringement claim could not have been raised in the Puerto Rico court:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[C]laim preclusion generally does not apply where [the] plaintiff was unable to rely on a certain theory of the case or to seek a certain remedy because of the limitations on the subject matter jurisdiction of the courts.... If state preclusion law includes this requirement of prior jurisdictional competency ... a state judgment will <i>not</i> have claim preclusive effect on a cause of action within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Marrese v.

Consequently, the other issues that Adcom argued below are not properly before us in these appeals, and it would be inappropriate to reach them. <i>Cf. United States v. Moran,</i> 393 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir. 2004) (in certain circumstances, an appellee must raise alternative bases for affirming a favorable judgment or risk waiver). Accordingly, we vacate the judgment on the basis that res judicata does not bar the action, without expressing any view on whether either party might eventually be entitled to summary judgment on other grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it appropriate, to forestall unnecessary difficulties in future appeals, to address an issue involving our own rules and our need for English translations of Puerto Rico court decisions relied on by the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Very briefly, summary judgment was ordered for Adcom on the basis of Puerto Rico court decisions that were submitted to the district court in Spanish. Gener filed a motion requesting the court to order Adcom to file English translations of these decisions for the purpose of compiling an appellate record, but the motion was denied. The impact of the Puerto Rico decisions was critical to our review on appeal, and we therefore ordered Adcom to produce certified translations of them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our rules require that such translations be part of the record on appeal for the very reason that we were obliged to order their submission; we cannot effectively review a judgment that relies on non-English materials. Under these rules, \"[i]f an unpublished. . . opinion of another court is cited\" by a party for an authorized purpose, including \"support [of] a claim of res judicata,\" \"a copy of the opinion or disposition must be included in an accompanying addendum or appendix.\" 1st Cir. R. 32.3(b), (a)(1), (a)(3). If that decision is not in English, another local rule specifies that \"[t]he court will not receive documents not in the English language unless translations are furnished.\" 1st Cir.

Municipality of Guaynabo,</i> 285 F.3d 142, 148 (1st Cir.2002), we do not feel that this is a situation calling for sanctions. Understandably, but unfortunately, the focus of court and parties in dealing with Gener's motion was on precedent and argument concerning the need to provide translations of non-English <i>evidence.</i> Gener's motion and Adcom's opposition were framed in these terms. In this context, the district court may have concluded that the requested translations were non-evidentiary materials and thus outside that precedent, overlooking counsel's separate obligation to provide the appellate court with translations of unpublished court decisions supporting the claim of res judicata.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Adcom points out that it was never ordered to submit a translation, and Gener, while vigorously arguing as we have noted, did not invoke the rules explicitly requiring such translations. Nor did Gener seek from us an order for translations with extended time for briefing. All things considered, we deem sanctions inappropriate here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judgment <i>vacated.

The parties had litigated the ownership of the images themselves in the Puerto Rico Circuit Court of Appeals. That court held that, as a matter of Puerto Rico law, the actual images belonged to Adcom. Appellant then obtained a copyright to the images and brought this federal action. The district court found that, under the doctrine of res judicata, the federal action was precluded by the earlier Puerto Rico court judgment, and granted summary judgment for the defendant. That ruling was erroneous. Res judicata does not apply because the Puerto Rico court did not have (and did not purport to have) jurisdiction over any potential federal copyright claims.

He contracted with Adcom, an advertising agency, to prepare images and advertising and promotional materials to use in Adcom's ads for its clients, including Supermercados Mr. Special. The photographs and digital images were stored on computers owned by Gener but located at Adcom facilities. The contract did not specify who retained the copyright to the images.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 22, 2000, Adcom terminated the contract and demanded that Gener turn over the images. He refused, and Adcom seized his computers. Gener then filed a \"grievance\" before a magistrate in the Investigations section of the San Juan Judiciary Center, seeking a provisional adjudication of the dispute under 32 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167;&#167; 2871-2877 (authorizing magistrates to provisionally decide certain controversies). The court ordered that the disputed images be removed from Gener's computers, copied to diskettes, and deposited with the court under seal pending litigation over the ownership of the images.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Adcom filed an action in the Puerto Rico Court of First Instance, seeking, <i>inter alia,</i> a declaration that it was the owner of the works contained on the disk on the basis of its contract with Gener. Adcom also argued that it held the copyright to the images under the doctrine of a \"work made for hire.\" <i>See</i> 17 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 101, 201(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Gener responded that Adcom's claim was for economic rights deriving from the images, and thus the Puerto Rico law claim was preempted by federal copyright law and the Puerto Rico court lacked jurisdiction. <i>See</i> 17 U.S.C. &#167; 301(a) (preemption); 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1338(a) (exclusive federal jurisdiction).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We pause to explain this jurisdictional issue because it is central to understanding both how the Puerto Rico courts viewed the case and how we apply the doctrine of res judicata.

The question of whether the suit \"arises under\" the copyright law is considerably more sophisticated. The most frequently cited test is that formulated by the Second Circuit, along the lines that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">an action \"arises under\" the Copyright Act if and only if the complaint is for a remedy expressly granted by the Act, e.g., a suit for infringement. . ., or asserts a claim requiring construction of the Act, . . ., or, at the very least and perhaps more doubtfully, presents a case where a distinctive policy of the Act requires that federal principles control the disposition of the claim. The general interest that copyrights, like all other forms of property, should be enjoyed by their true owner is not enough to meet this last test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 2 (quoting <i>T.B.

Conversely, if Adcom did <i>not</i> hold the copyright to the images under that doctrine, the contractual claim over the images themselves would not be preempted and the court would have jurisdiction to decide it. <i>See Adcom Group, Inc. v. Gener,</i> No. KPE-00-0640, slip op. at 7-8, 14 (P.R.

The court concluded that, because Gener was an independent contractor and the images at issue did not fall into certain specific categories, the images did not constitute \"work made for hire\" under federal copyright law. <i>See Adcom I</i> at 12-14.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> It did, however, credit Adcom's contractual argument, and held that \"all the graphic artworks commissioned by [Adcom] from [Gener] during the effective period of the contract belong to [Adcom].\" <i>Id.</i> at 22.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court was careful to emphasize the limited nature of its holding. In response to Gener's argument that Adcom's claim fell within exclusive federal jurisdiction, the court explained that the action (as narrowed and construed by the court) did not arise under federal copyright law because it was \"not based on a claim for an author's economic rights, but on the delivery of a computer disk over which[] [Adcom] alleges having an ownership right due to having paid for the information contained in it.\" <i>Id.</i> at 19. The court emphasized this point again towards the end of its opinion:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[W]e are not adjudicating the possible intellectual original ownership which [Gener] may have with regard to the works in controversy....

That court largely repeated the trial court's reasoning. <i>See Adcom Group, Inc. v. Gener,</i> No. KLAN-00-00775 (P.R. Ct.App. Mar. 30, 2001) (certified translation) (\"<i>Adcom II</i>\"). After an extensive analysis, it concluded that the \"work made for hire\" doctrine did not apply, and that the Puerto Rico courts had jurisdiction over the suit. <i>See id.</i> at 10-11. It agreed with the trial court's analysis that the suit concerned ownership of the actual images, not intellectual property rights:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As was correctly pointed out by the judge from the [trial court], we don't have before us a claim for an author's patrimonial rights, but a claim for the delivery of a computer diskette over which [Adcom] alleges having rights due to having paid for the information contained in it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 13. Finally, it affirmed the trial court's ultimate determination that \"the work performed by [Gener], by virtue of his contract with [Adcom], belongs to the latter.\" <i>Id.</i> at 14.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That summer, Gener applied for a copyright to the images.

Gener responded, in part, that the Puerto Rico and federal claims lacked sufficient identity because the Puerto Rico courts could not (and did not purport to) resolve any federal copyright questions. In Gener's view, the Puerto Rico court's discussion of the \"work made for hire\" doctrine was solely for the purpose of determining whether its jurisdiction was preempted or not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted the motion for summary judgment on the grounds of res judicata. It noted Gener's argument that the Puerto Rico court lacked jurisdiction to determine who had the copyright to the images, but explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he state court did properly exercise its authority to interpret the terms of the contract and determine that the suit did not involve copyright law.

Gener moved to alter or amend the judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e), repeating his argument that the Puerto Rico court only adjudicated ownership of the images themselves and not of the intellectual property rights thereto, but the district court denied the motion.

The district court's sole stated basis for granting summary judgment for defendants was res judicata. Since federal courts accord a Puerto Rico judgment the same preclusive effect as would a Puerto Rico court, <i>see</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1738, we apply Puerto Rico res judicata law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Puerto Rico, as in most jurisdictions, the term \"res judicata\" is often used to refer to either of two distinct but related doctrines. The first doctrine (known variously as claim preclusion, merger and bar doctrine, or simply res judicata) \"generally binds parties from litigating or relitigating any [claim] that was or could have been litigated in a prior adjudication and prevents claim splitting.\" <i>Futura Dev.

The second doctrine (known as issue preclusion or collateral estoppel) \"fore-closes relitigation in a subsequent action of a fact essential for rendering a judgment in a prior action between the same parties, even when different causes of action are involved.\" <i>Texaco P.R., Inc. v.

The district court based its analysis entirely on claim preclusion, and the parties do the same on appeal. Consequently, so do we. <i>See Fleet Nat'l Bank v. Gray</i> (<i>In re Bankvest Capital Corp.</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201116\"><a href=\"/opinion/201116/fleet-national-bank-v-gray/\"><span class=\"volume\">375</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span>, 69-70 (1st Cir.2004) (analyzing only the branch of res judicata doctrine argued by the parties).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Puerto Rico accords claim preclusive effect to a prior decision when \"between the case decided by the sentence and that in which the same is invoked, there [is] the most perfect identity between the things, causes, and persons of the litigants, and their capacity as such.\" 31 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 3343. While \"courts typically have refrained from interpreting the phrase `perfect identity' literally\" and \"nominal differences between two actions [do not] undermine the preclusive effect of a commonwealth court ruling,\" <i>Cruz v.

Furthermore, a decision has claim preclusive effect only if it was \"rendered by a court with proper jurisdiction.\" <i>Felix Davis v.

Gener challenges the identity of the Puerto Rico and federal actions, arguing that the Puerto Rico action did not arise under federal copyright law, and he could not have brought the present copyright infringement action in the Puerto Rico court because, under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1338(a), the Puerto Rico court would have lacked subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree. The Circuit Court of Appeals specifically construed Adcom's Puerto Rico action as arising under Puerto Rico law. It carefully emphasized that the case was not \"a claim for an author's patrimonial rights, but a claim for the delivery of a computer diskette.\" <i>Adcom II</i> at 13. It quoted approvingly the trial court's statement that \"`[w]e are dealing with a controversy of a contractual nature for which this Court does have jurisdiction.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Adcom I</i> at 19); <i>see also Adcom I</i> at 23 (repeating that court was \"not adjudicating the possible intellectual original ownership which [Gener] may have with regard to the works in controversy\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, Adcom argued in the Puerto Rico court that \"it has a right over the information in controversy in light of the doctrine of work made for hire,\" and the Puerto Rico court expressly concluded that the work made for hire doctrine did not entitle Adcom to the copyright to the images. <i>Adcom II</i> at 7, 10. But the entire purpose of that discussion was to illustrate that Adcom's contractual claims were separate from any copyright issues and were within the Puerto Rico courts' jurisdiction. As we understand it, the Puerto Rico court's \"work made for hire\" analysis was solely for the purpose of determining whether the Puerto Rico court had jurisdiction or not. The court discussed that doctrine to explain why Adcom's complaint did not arise under copyright law, which might have caused the entire action to fall under exclusive federal jurisdiction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Gener's argument that the entire case should be dismissed because it arose under federal copyright law did not actually transform the case into one that arose under federal copyright law; rather, the Puerto Rico court carefully separated out the Puerto Rico law claims and adjudicated only those claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, Adcom never clearly explains what either was, or should have been, litigated or decided in the Puerto Rico courts with preclusive effect in this case. If Adcom means that the entire dispute should have been aired before the Puerto Rico court, and any claims that could have been (but were not) raised in the Puerto Rico court are barred, the argument fails because Gener's infringement claim could not have been raised in the Puerto Rico court:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[C]laim preclusion generally does not apply where [the] plaintiff was unable to rely on a certain theory of the case or to seek a certain remedy because of the limitations on the subject matter jurisdiction of the courts.... If state preclusion law includes this requirement of prior jurisdictional competency ... a state judgment will <i>not</i> have claim preclusive effect on a cause of action within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Marrese v.

Consequently, the other issues that Adcom argued below are not properly before us in these appeals, and it would be inappropriate to reach them. <i>Cf. United States v.

Accordingly, we vacate the judgment on the basis that res judicata does not bar the action, without expressing any view on whether either party might eventually be entitled to summary judgment on other grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it appropriate, to forestall unnecessary difficulties in future appeals, to address an issue involving our own rules and our need for English translations of Puerto Rico court decisions relied on by the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Very briefly, summary judgment was ordered for Adcom on the basis of Puerto Rico court decisions that were submitted to the district court in Spanish. Gener filed a motion requesting the court to order Adcom to file English translations of these decisions for the purpose of compiling an appellate record, but the motion was denied. The impact of the Puerto Rico decisions was critical to our review on appeal, and we therefore ordered Adcom to produce certified translations of them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our rules require that such translations be part of the record on appeal for the very reason that we were obliged to order their submission; we cannot effectively review a judgment that relies on non-English materials. Under these rules, \"[i]f an unpublished. . . opinion of another court is cited\" by a party for an authorized purpose, including \"support [of] a claim of res judicata,\" \"a copy of the opinion or disposition must be included in an accompanying addendum or appendix.\" 1st Cir. R. 32.3(b), (a)(1), (a)(3). If that decision is not in English, another local rule specifies that \"[t]he court will not receive documents not in the English language unless translations are furnished.\" 1st Cir. R. 30(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we have made clear that the parties may not disregard such rules with impunity, <i>see Deniz v. Municipality of Guaynabo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199916\"><a href=\"/opinion/199916/deniz-marquez-v-guaynabo-pr/\"><span class=\"volume\">285</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">142</span></a></span>, 148 (1st Cir.2002), we do not feel that this is a situation calling for sanctions. Understandably, but unfortunately, the focus of court and parties in dealing with Gener's motion was on precedent and argument concerning the need to provide translations of non-English <i>evidence.</i> Gener's motion and Adcom's opposition were framed in these terms. In this context, the district court may have concluded that the requested translations were non-evidentiary materials and thus outside that precedent, overlooking counsel's separate obligation to provide the appellate court with translations of unpublished court decisions supporting the claim of res judicata.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Adcom points out that it was never ordered to submit a translation, and Gener, while vigorously arguing as we have noted, did not invoke the rules explicitly requiring such translations. Nor did Gener seek from us an order for translations with extended time for briefing. All things considered, we deem sanctions inappropriate here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judgment <i>vacated.

Transfer of ownership of any material object, including the copy . . . in which the work is first fixed, does not of itself convey any rights in the copyrighted work embodied in the object. . . .\" 17 U.S.C. &#167; 202. For example, a collector who buys a painting from an artist may hang it in his house or sell it to a third party.
