Edward F. Harrington, Senior U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n              Torruella and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Timothy G. Watkins, Federal Defender Office, for defendant.\n     Michael J. Pelgro, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief for the\nUnited States.\n\n\n                          June 19, 2003\n\f              BOUDIN, Chief Judge.   José Picanso was convicted of four\n\ncounts   of    distributing    cocaine,     one   count   of   conspiracy   to\n\ndistribute, and two counts of aiding and abetting distribution.\n\nSee 21 U.S.C. §§ 841, 846 (2000).           He now appeals his sentence,\n\nobjecting to his designation as an organizer or leader.             U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 3B1.1(a) (2002).       The government cross-appeals to contest the\n\ntrial court's attribution to Picanso of a drug quantity less than\n\nthat urged by the government.        Both claims of error are plausible\n\nbut, by a close margin, we uphold the sentence against both\n\nattacks.\n\n              Picanso   was   indicted     with   seven   co-defendants     on\n\ntrafficking charges in late 1999.           Trial began on July 17, 2000,\n\nand in view of the then-recent decision in Apprendi v. New Jersey,\n\n530 U.S. 466 (2000), the district court approved the government's\n\nrequest to ask the jury to determine drug quantity.              On July 26,\n\nPicanso was convicted on the above-mentioned counts.              By special\n\nverdict, the jury found Picanso responsible for at least 500 grams\n\nbut less than 5 kilograms of cocaine, making him liable under the\n\nstatute to a minimum sentence of 5 years and a maximum sentence of\n\n40 years.      21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B).\n\n               At the sentencing hearing, the government recommended\n\nthat the court find Picanso responsible for 5 to 15 kilograms of\n\ncocaine, equating under the guidelines to a base offense level\n\n(\"BOL\") of 32.      U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c)(4).       It also sought a 4-level\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fincrease under section 3B1.1(a) which provides, \"If the defendant\n\nwas an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved\n\nfive or more participants or was otherwise extensive, increase [the\n\noffense level] by 4 levels.\"         Both positions were supported by the\n\nprobation officer's pre-sentence report (\"PSR\").            The resulting\n\ntotal offense level (\"TOL\") of 36, coupled with Picanso's criminal\n\nhistory (category II), would have translated into a guideline\n\nsentencing    range   of   210-262    months.    U.S.S.G.   Ch.   5,   Pt.   A\n\n(sentencing table).\n\n          Picanso opposed both the quantity and role-in-offense\n\nadjustments sought by the government.           As to the former, Picanso\n\nsaid that he was responsible for less than 5 kilos and he pointed\n\nto the jury's special verdict as implying its rejection of the\n\ngovernment's position.      The district court first said, \"You don't\n\nhave to argue the jury verdict with me, I'm bound by it.\"              After\n\nfurther discussion, described more fully below, the district court\n\nretreated somewhat from this position but still found Picanso\n\nresponsible for between 500 grams and 2 kilos, resulting in a BOL\n\nof 26.   U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c)(7).\n\n             However, the district court agreed with the government\n\nthat the conspiracy involved five or more participants (a point now\n\nundisputed) and that Picanso qualified as an organizer or leader,\n\nwarranting an upward adjustment of 4 levels.         The result was a TOL\n\nof 30 and guideline range of 108-135 months.        U.S.S.G. Ch.5, Pt. A.\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fThe   district   court    then    sentenced     Picanso    to   122    months   of\n\nimprisonment.    Picanso appealed to contest the factual basis for\n\nthe 4-level role enhancement, and the government countered by\n\ncross-appealing from the district court's ruling that Picanso was\n\nliable for only 500 grams to 2 kilos of cocaine.\n\n           Role Enhancement.        We begin with Picanso's appeal.             To\n\njustify the role enhancement, the government carries the burden of\n\nproving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant was\n\nthe \"organizer or leader\" of a criminal activity. United States v.\n\nCruz, 120 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1997) (en banc), cert. denied, 522\n\nU.S. 1064 (1998).        The guideline commentary states in pertinent\n\npart:\n\n           Factors the court should consider include the\n           exercise of decision making authority, the\n           nature of participation in the commission of\n           the offense, the recruitment of accomplices,\n           the claimed right to a larger share of the\n           fruits   of   the   crime,  the   degree   of\n           participation in planning or organizing the\n           offense, the nature and scope of the illegal\n           activity, and the degree of control and\n           authority exercised over others.\n\nU.S.S.G. § 3B1.1, comment., n.4.\n\n           The underlying drug conspiracy involved Picanso and a\n\nnumber of other drug dealers operating out of two Portuguese-\n\nAmerican   social    clubs   in    the   Back    Central    area      of   Lowell,\n\nMassachusetts.      Picanso's position is that he was one independent\n\ndrug dealer among many; he supplied many of the drug dealers that\n\nsold to end users, but (he says) they were all free agents and he\n\n                                     -4-\n\fexercised no control over them.    The government seems to concede\n\nthat Picanso was not a \"leader\" of a unified group of drug dealers,\n\nbut argues nonetheless that he pulled the \"organizational strings\"\n\nby virtue of his control of the supply of cocaine.    It relies among\n\nother decisions on United States v. Tejada-Beltran, 50 F.3d 105\n\n(1st Cir. 1995):\n\n            One may be classified as an organizer, though\n            perhaps not as a leader, if he coordinates\n            others so as to facilitate the commission of\n            criminal activity.    The key to determining\n            whether a defendant qualifies as an organizer\n            is   not   direct    control   but   relative\n            responsibility. . . .       [T]he four level\n            enhancement applies whether or not [the\n            defendant] retains supervisory control over\n            the other participants.\n\nId. at 112 (internal citations omitted).\n\n            In substance, Picanso was a wholesaler.      Evidently he\n\nsecured cocaine in bulk on trips to New York.        According to the\n\nPSR, Picanso \"acquired kilograms of cocaine from his sources and\n\n. . . broke down the kilograms into ounces and sold multiple ounces\n\non a regular basis.\"     After he distributed the drugs to retail\n\ndealers, they in turn would cut the cocaine and sell it to end\n\nusers.     Consistent with this description, it is also undisputed\n\nthat Picanso was the \"primary cocaine supplier\" to these retail\n\ndealers.\n\n            The greater quantities in which a wholesaler deals and\n\nhis larger profits cannot alone trigger the role enhancement,\n\nUnited States v. Fuller, 897 F.2d 1217, 1221 (1st Cir. 1990), and\n\n                                -5-\n\fthe reason is plain. The base offense level already takes quantity\n\n(and, implicitly,      profit)     into       account,   id. at     1222;   and    if\n\nquantity alone were enough, every wholesaler in a significant\n\nconspiracy with retailers would be characterized as an organizer or\n\nleader.      Here, the retail dealers were free to purchase from\n\nothers, and did so before, during, and after Picanso's arrival on\n\nthe scene.    Nevertheless, under Tejada-Beltran, a wholesaler even\n\nwithout   full-scale      control        of     his   retailers     could     still\n\n\"coordinate[] others\" so as to \"facilitate\" the criminal activity.\n\n50 F.3d at 112.\n\n             The government points to several indicia to suggest a\n\nmeasure of control and coordination by Picanso. Several seem to us\n\nweak, at least in isolation.         Yes, when other drug dealers called\n\nPicanso for a delivery, he would name a time and place for the\n\ntransaction, but this de minimis planning is inherent in a criminal\n\ntransaction involving more than one party. Nor does it distinguish\n\nPicanso from most sellers that as a formal matter he set the price\n\nand terms for his own sales.              And, though some dealers regard\n\nPicanso as the \"king,\" the guideline commentary provides that\n\n\"titles such as 'kingpin' or 'boss' are not controlling,\" U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 3B1.1, comment., n.4, although the commentary does not say that\n\nthe perceptions of co-conspirators are automatically irrelevant.\n\n             More   helpful   to   the    government     is   the    report   by    a\n\nconfidential witness (contained in the PSR) that Picanso boasted\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fthat he \"would shut [a co-defendant] down for good if [the co-\n\ndefendant] messed up again.\" The ability to regulate participation\n\nin the local drug trade is surely an indicium of power and control.\n\nThis statement was not introduced at trial, and Picanso questions\n\nwhether the sentencing judge actually relied on it, but sentencing\n\ndecisions can rest on facts contained in the PSR and obvious\n\nevidence in the record supporting the district court's ultimate\n\nfinding is sufficient.         Cruz, 120 F.3d at 2; see also United States\n\nv. Medina, 167 F.3d 77, 80 (1st Cir. 1999) (no need for specific\n\nfindings if evidence obvious).\n\n            There was also some evidence that Picanso on at least one\n\noccasion arranged for a transfer of drugs that involved Picanso as\n\nsupplier,   one     of   his   retailers,      and    an   acquaintance       of   the\n\nretailer.      How   far    this     showed   Picanso      to   be   orchestrating\n\ndownstream transactions is a matter of inference; but inference\n\ndrawing is part of fact-finding confided to the district court. To\n\nthe   extent      that     Picanso    was     effectively       supervising        the\n\narrangements for a sale by the retailer for further distribution,\n\nit becomes easier to describe him as an organizer of something more\n\nthan his own wholesaling.            Cf. United States v. Brown, 298 F.3d\n\n120, 123 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 123 S. Ct. 710 (2002).\n\n            While    the    pillars    may    be     individually     weak,    taken\n\ntogether they provide somewhat stronger support for the district\n\ncourt's   ultimate       finding.      To    summarize,     Picanso    supplied      a\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fsubstantial    network     of   retailers,    set   the   terms    for   his     own\n\ntransactions with them, was regarded as the kingpin by other\n\nconspirators, and–-drawing inferences in favor of the ultimate\n\nfinding–-had some influence over the operations of the retailers\n\nthemselves.     Probably this could be said of many wholesalers but\n\nnot all.\n\n           There is no mathematical formula for drawing the line on\n\none side of which one can be called an organizer.                 Although there\n\nmust be    a   core   of   facts   to   support     the   label   and    not    pure\n\nintuition, the issue also turns in some measure on an overall\n\nassessment of the defendant's role based on an assemblage of\n\ndetail.    The district court, having presided over the trial and\n\nheard the evidence first hand, said he had no doubt that Picanso\n\nwas the organizer.     The trial judge has the advantage over us as to\n\nboth the raw facts and the \"feel\" of the situation.                United States\n\nv. Rivera, 994 F.2d 942, 952 (1st Cir. 1993).              Our review is only\n\nfor clear error, United States v. Martinez-Medina, 279 F.3d 105,\n\n123 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 123 S. Ct. 311 (2002), and we do not\n\nfind it here.\n\n           Drug Quantity. The PSR attributed to Picanso a series of\n\nspecific small amounts of cocaine based on evidence as to his\n\nidentified direct sales to retailers, his personal possession of a\n\nsmall amount on arrest, and other specific sales deemed to be\n\nrelevant conduct as to Picanso.           See U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3(a).             These\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fadded up to less than a kilo, but the probation officer in the PSR\n\nrecommended that Picanso be held responsible for between 5 and 15\n\nkilos based crudely (there was no calculation) on the length of his\n\ninvolvement and frequency of sales, and on a few recorded or\n\nreported statements of Picanso.      For example, Picanso said on one\n\noccasion that he had just brought 5 kilos from New York.\n\n            In addition, at the sentencing hearing, the government\n\noffered an affidavit of the case agent from the Drug Enforcement\n\nAdministration.     Following a familiar technique, see United States\n\nv. Robinson, 241 F.3d 115, 117 n.1 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 534\n\nU.S. 856 (2001), the affidavit converted the amount of money seized\n\nfrom the home of Picanso's girlfriend ($639,000) into kilos of\n\ncocaine, basing the calculation on prices that Picanso was charging\n\nat the time of his sales and other such data.             The affidavit\n\nconcluded that the cash represented the proceeds from between 44\n\nand   82   kilos   of   cocaine.   This   assumes,   plausibly   but   not\n\nassuredly, that the money was Picanso's and that he had no other\n\nsource of income.1\n\n            Against this background, the government on appeal objects\n\nto the district court's ruling attributing to Picanso only 500\n\ngrams to 2 kilos.        Two arguments are offered: one is that the\n\n\n      1\n      The money was seized from a safe in his girlfriend's house\nwell after Picanso's arrest and, sensibly, he made no effort in the\nforfeiture proceeding to claim the money as his. Probably it was–-\na document pertaining to Picanso was also in the safe–-but there\nwas no definitive proof of ownership or derivation.\n\n                                   -9-\n\fdistrict court deemed itself bound or was overly influenced by the\n\njury's special verdict; the other is that–-whatever the jury\n\nbelieved--the evidence compelled a finding by the district court\n\nthat for guideline purposes Picanso was responsible for 5 to 15\n\nkilos.   We address the arguments in this order.\n\n           As already recounted, the district court said, at the\n\noutset of argument on the amount issue, that it was \"bound\" by the\n\njury verdict holding Picanso responsible for at least 500 grams but\n\nless than 5 kilograms.      This was true to the limited extent that\n\nunder Apprendi, this finding fixed the maximum sentence permitted\n\nby the statute at 40 years; but it was false as to the proper\n\ndetermination   of    Picanso's   guideline   sentence   which   resolved\n\n(subject to the 40-year maximum) just how much time he would\n\nactually serve.      See Derman v. United States, 298 F.3d 34, 42-43\n\n(1st Cir.), cert. denied, 123 S. Ct. 636 (2002).          The guideline\n\nrange is driven, in drug cases, primarily by quantity (together\n\nwith criminal history category).\n\n           A jury determination as to the quantity of drugs for\n\nwhich the defendant is responsible does not prevent the district\n\ncourt from finding a larger amount in the course of determining the\n\nguideline sentence.2    The reason is straightforward.     In making its\n\n\n     2\n      This is settled law in the circuits including this one. See\nUnited States v. Caba, 241 F.3d 98, 101 (1st Cir. 2001); see also\nUnited States v. Titlbach, 300 F.3d 919, 922 (8th Cir. 2002), cert.\ndenied, 123 S. Ct. 926 (2003); United States v. Smith, 308 F.3d\n726, 744 (7th Cir. 2002); United States v. Dennis, 271 F.3d 71, 73-\n\n                                   -10-\n\fown quantity determination for the purpose of determining the\n\nstatutory maximum, the jury asks what quantity has been proved\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.         See Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 490.          By\n\ncontrast, in fixing the guideline sentence, the district court is\n\nsupposed to ask whether the government has proven the pertinent\n\namount by a preponderance of the evidence.              See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Eirby, 262 F.3d 31, 36-37 (1st Cir. 2001).                The judge\n\ncould therefore quite rationally find an amount higher than was\n\nfound by the jury.     See United States v. Watts, 519 U.S. 148, 156\n\n(1997) (per curiam).\n\n             Admittedly, this is lawyers' logic.            Cf. Restatement\n\n(Second) of Judgments § 28(4) & comment f (1982); id. § 85, comment\n\ng.   Many laymen, told that the jury's verdict was being ignored,\n\nwould think that there was something wrong.           Some might think this\n\nappearance problem is reason enough to change the law and--in the\n\nsensitive context of criminal sentencing--to respect the jury's\n\nfinding despite the discrepancy in burdens of proof.            But, as the\n\nlaw stands, the district judge is not only free to make his own\n\nindependent finding but is essentially obliged to do so.              Edwards\n\nv. United States, 523 U.S. 511, 514 (1998) (guidelines \"require the\n\njudge   to   determine\"   nature    and    quantity    of   drugs    involved\n\n\"regardless of jury's actual, or assumed, beliefs\"); cf. Watts, 519\n\n\n74 (2d Cir. 2001) (per curiam) (jury special interrogatories). We\nrecently reaffirmed this reading of Apprendi in United States v.\nGoodine, 326 F.3d 26, 27, 32-34 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n                                    -11-\n\fU.S. at 156 (sentence enhancement can be based on conduct acquitted\n\nby jury).\n\n            At the sentencing hearing, the district judge–-although\n\nstarting with the claim that he was \"bound\" by the jury's quantity\n\ndetermination–-steadily backed away from that position under the\n\nforce of the government's respectful argument.    For example, when\n\nthe district judge said he would create a legal issue if he\n\ndeparted from the jury's finding, the government explained that he\n\nwould instead create one if he rested on that finding.   In the end,\n\nthe district court made a ruling that Picanso was responsible for\n\n500 grams to 2 kilos, stating that he was \"not bound, but inclined\"\n\nto agree with the jury and that at least this ruling would be \"in\n\nharmony\" with the jury's verdict.\n\n            On appeal, the government argues that the district judge\n\nremained under the misapprehension that he either was bound by the\n\njury's verdict or should at least give it substantial weight.    If\n\nthe former were true, this would clearly be legal error, United\n\nStates v. Tavano, 12 F.3d 301, 307 (1st Cir. 1993), and arguably so\n\nin the latter case, too, notwithstanding the seemingly contrary\n\nview of the Sixth Circuit, United States v. Prior, 941 F.2d 427,\n\n430-31 (1991).   But our own judgment, after a careful review of the\n\nfull and extensive colloquy, is that the district judge got the\n\nmessage even though he did not like it.   We are also confident that\n\na remand on this point would not change the ultimate result.\n\n\n                                -12-\n\f          It is a different question whether the district court's\n\nown finding that Picanso was liable for 500 grams to 2 kilograms is\n\nclear   error.     The   government   says   that–-at    least   under    a\n\npreponderance standard--the evidence virtually compelled a finding\n\nthat Picanso was responsible for 5 to 15 kilos.         Put differently,\n\nthe government says that it was clear error for the district court\n\nnot to accept the recommendation of the probation officer.               The\n\ndifference in quantity is important: given Picanso's organizer\n\nadjustment   and   criminal   history   category,   the    first   amount\n\nimplicates a guideline range of 108-135 months; the latter 210-262\n\nmonths.   U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c)(4), (7); id. Ch. 5, Pt. A.\n\n          There is certainly a very good argument for the higher\n\nrange urged by the government–-and Picanso took a serious risk if\n\nhe provoked the cross-appeal--but the facts are peculiar.            The\n\ndistrict court's smaller figure corresponds to hard evidence of\n\ndirect sales; the government's larger ones are based on the PSR's\n\nrough extrapolation based on Picanso's ongoing involvement in drug\n\ndealing; on reports of what Picanso said, possibly in boasts; and\n\non the belief that the funds seized from the house of Picanso's\n\ngirlfriend were his own drug proceeds.       If we were making our own\n\nfinding, the combined weight of this evidence might well persuade\n\nus.\n\n           Yet this time the \"clearly erroneous\" standard works in\n\nPicanso's favor.    See United States v. Rivera-Maldonado, 194 F.3d\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\f224, 228 n.2 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"broad discretion\" of district\n\ncourt); Rivera, 994 F.2d at 952.       The appraisal of amount depends\n\non inference drawing and perhaps credibility and we are not only\n\nloath but forbidden to substitute our own de novo assessment for\n\nthat of the judge who tried the case and heard the evidence first\n\nhand.   There were two close calls in this case–-one as to role in\n\nthe offense   and   the   other   as   to   amount.   One   went   for   the\n\ngovernment and the other for Picanso.        Someone has to have the last\n\nword on close calls as to the facts and it is right that it should\n\nbe the district judge.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\f",

He now appeals his sentence, objecting to his designation as an organizer or leader. U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(a) (2002). The government cross-appeals to contest the trial court's attribution to Picanso of a drug quantity less than that urged by the government. Both claims of error are plausible but, by a close margin, we uphold the sentence against both attacks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Picanso was indicted with seven co-defendants on trafficking charges in late 1999. Trial began on July 17, 2000, and in view of the then-recent decision in <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the district court approved the government's request to ask the jury to determine drug quantity. On July 26, Picanso was convicted on the above-mentioned counts. By special verdict, the jury found Picanso responsible for at least 500 grams but less than 5 kilograms of cocaine, making him liable under the statute to a minimum sentence of 5 years and a maximum sentence of 40 years. 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing, the government recommended that the court find Picanso responsible for 5 to 15 kilograms of cocaine, equating under the guidelines to a base offense level (\"BOL\") of 32. U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(c)(4). It also sought a 4 level increase under section 3B1.1(a) which provides, \"If the defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive, increase [the offense level] by 4-levels.\" Both positions were supported by the probation officer's presentence report (\"PSR\"). The resulting total offense level (\"TOL\") of 36, coupled with Picanso's criminal history (category II), would have translated into a guideline sentencing range of 210-262 months. U.S.S.G. Ch. 5, Pt. A (sentencing table).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Picanso opposed both the quantity and role-in-offense adjustments sought by the government. As to the former, Picanso said that he was responsible for less than 5 kilos and he pointed to the jury's special verdict as implying its rejection of the government's position. The district court first said, \"You don't have to argue the jury verdict with me, I'm bound by it.\" After further discussion, described more fully below, the district court retreated somewhat from this position but still found Picanso responsible for between 500 grams and 2 kilos, resulting in a BOL of 26. U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(c)(7).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the district court agreed with the government that the conspiracy involved five or more participants (a point now undisputed) and that Picanso qualified as an organizer or leader, warranting an upward adjustment of 4 levels. The result was a TOL of 30 and guideline range of 108-135 months. U.S.S.G. Ch. 5, Pt. A. The district court then sentenced Picanso to 122 months of imprisonment. Picanso appealed to contest the factual basis for the 4-level role enhancement, and the government countered by cross-appealing from the district court's ruling that Picanso was liable for only 500 grams to 2 kilos of cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Role Enhancement.</i> We begin with Picanso's appeal. To justify the role enhancement, the government carries the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant was the \"organizer or leader\" of a criminal activity. <i>United States v. Cruz,</i> 120 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1997) (en banc), <i>cert. denied,</i> 522 U.S. 1064, 118 S.Ct. 729, 139 L.Ed.2d 667 (1998). The guideline commentary states in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Factors the court should consider include the exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1, comment., n. 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The underlying drug conspiracy involved Picanso and a number of other drug dealers operating out of two Portuguese-American social clubs in the Back Central area of Lowell, Massachusetts. Picanso's position is that he was one independent drug dealer among many; he supplied many of the drug dealers that sold to end users, but (he says) they were all free agents and he exercised no control over them. The government seems to concede that Picanso was not a \"leader\" of a unified group of drug dealers, but argues nonetheless that he pulled the \"organizational strings\" by virtue of his control of the supply of cocaine. It relies among other decisions on <i>United States v. Tejada-Beltran,</i> 50 F.3d 105 (1st Cir.1995):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One may be classified as an organizer, though perhaps not as a leader, if he coordinates others so as to facilitate the commission of criminal activity. The key to determining whether a defendant qualifies as an organizer is not direct control but relative responsibility.... [T]he four level enhancement applies whether or not [the defendant] retains supervisory control over the other participants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 112 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In substance, Picanso was a wholesaler. Evidently he secured cocaine in bulk on trips to New York. According to the PSR, Picanso \"acquired kilograms of cocaine from his sources and ... broke down the kilograms into ounces and sold multiple ounces on a regular basis.\" After he distributed the drugs to retail dealers, they in turn would cut the cocaine and sell it to end users. Consistent with this description, it is also undisputed that Picanso was the \"primary cocaine supplier\" to these retail dealers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The greater quantities in which a wholesaler deals and his larger profits cannot alone trigger the role enhancement, <i>United States v. Fuller,</i> 897 F.2d 1217, 1221 (1st Cir.1990), and the reason is plain. The base offense level already takes quantity (and, implicitly, profit) into account, <i>id.</i> at 1222; and if quantity alone were enough, every wholesaler in a significant conspiracy with retailers would be characterized as an organizer or leader. Here, the retail dealers were free to purchase from others, and did so before, during, and after Picanso's arrival on the scene. Nevertheless, under <i>Tejada-Beltran,</i> a wholesaler even without full-scale control of his retailers could still \"coordinate[ ] others\" so as to \"facilitate\" the criminal activity. 50 F.3d at 112.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government points to several indicia to suggest a measure of control and coordination by Picanso. Several seem to us weak, at least in isolation. Yes, when other drug dealers called Picanso for a delivery, he would name a time and place for the transaction, but this <i>de minimis</i> planning is inherent in a criminal transaction involving more than one party. Nor does it distinguish Picanso from most sellers that as a formal matter he set the price and terms for his own sales. And, though some dealers regard Picanso as the \"king,\" the guideline commentary provides that \"titles such as `kingpin' or `boss' are not controlling,\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1, comment., n. 4, although the commentary does not say that the perceptions of co-conspirators are automatically irrelevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More helpful to the government is the report by a confidential witness (contained in the PSR) that Picanso boasted that he \"would shut [a co-defendant] down for good if [the co-defendant] messed up again.\" The ability to regulate participation in the local drug trade is surely an indicium of power and control. This statement was not introduced at trial, and Picanso questions whether the sentencing judge actually relied on it, but sentencing decisions can rest on facts contained in the PSR and obvious evidence in the record supporting the district court's ultimate finding is sufficient. <i>Cruz,</i> 120 F.3d at 2; <i>see also United States v. Medina,</i> 167 F.3d 77, 80 (1st Cir.1999) (no need for specific findings if evidence obvious).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was also some evidence that Picanso on at least one occasion arranged for a transfer of drugs that involved Picanso as supplier, one of his retailers, and an acquaintance of the retailer. How far this showed Picanso to be orchestrating downstream transactions is a matter of inference; but inference drawing is part of fact-finding confided to the district court. To the extent that Picanso was effectively supervising the arrangements for a sale by the retailer for further distribution, it becomes easier to describe him as an organizer of something more than his own wholesaling. <i>Cf. United States v. Brown,</i> 298 F.3d 120, 123 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 537 U.S. 1096, 123 S.Ct. 710, 154 L.Ed.2d 646 (2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the pillars may be individually weak, taken together they provide somewhat stronger support for the district court's ultimate finding. To summarize, Picanso supplied a substantial network of retailers, set the terms for his own transactions with them, was regarded as the kingpin by other conspirators, and &#8212; drawing inferences in favor of the ultimate finding &#8212; had some influence over the operations of the retailers themselves. Probably this could be said of many wholesalers but not all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no mathematical formula for drawing the line on one side of which one can be called an organizer. Although there must be a core of facts to support the label and not pure intuition, the issue also turns in some measure on an overall assessment of the defendant's role based on an assemblage of detail. The district court, having presided over the trial and heard the evidence first hand, said he had no doubt that Picanso was the organizer. The trial judge has the advantage over us as to both the raw facts and the \"feel\" of the situation. <i>United States v. Rivera,</i> 994 F.2d 942, 952 (1st Cir.1993). Our review is only for clear error, <i>United States v. Martinez-Medina,</i> 279 F.3d 105, 123 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 537 U.S. 1096, 123 S.Ct. 311, 154 L.Ed.2d 210 (2002), and we do not find it here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Drug Quantity.</i> The PSR attributed to Picanso a series of specific small amounts of cocaine based on evidence as to his identified direct sales to retailers, his personal possession of a small amount on arrest, and other specific sales deemed to be relevant conduct as to Picanso. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3(a). These added up to less than a kilo, but the probation officer in the PSR recommended that Picanso be held responsible for between 5 and 15 kilos based crudely (there was no calculation) on the length of his involvement and frequency of sales, and on a few recorded or reported statements of Picanso. For example, Picanso said on one occasion that he had just brought 5 kilos from New York.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, at the sentencing hearing, the government offered an affidavit of the case agent from the Drug Enforcement Administration. Following a familiar technique, <i>see United States v. Robinson,</i> 241 F.3d 115, 117 n. 1 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 534 U.S. 856, 122 S.Ct. 130, 151 L.Ed.2d 84 (2001), the affidavit converted the amount of money seized from the home of Picanso's girlfriend ($639,000) into kilos of cocaine, basing the calculation on prices that Picanso was charging at the time of his sales and other such data. The affidavit concluded that the cash represented the proceeds from between 44 and 82 kilos of cocaine. This assumes, plausibly but not assuredly, that the money was Picanso's and that he had no other source of income.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this background, the government on appeal objects to the district court's ruling attributing to Picanso only 500 grams to 2 kilos. Two arguments are offered: one is that the district court deemed itself bound or was overly influenced by the jury's special verdict; the other is that &#8212; whatever the jury believed &#8212; the evidence compelled a finding by the district court that for guideline purposes Picanso was responsible for 5 to 15 kilos. We address the arguments in this order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As already recounted, the district court said, at the outset of argument on the amount issue, that it was \"bound\" by the jury verdict holding Picanso responsible for at least 500 grams but less than 5 kilograms. This was true to the limited extent that under <i>Apprendi,</i> this finding fixed the <i>maximum</i> sentence permitted by the statute at 40 years; but it was false as to the proper determination of Picanso's guideline sentence which resolved (subject to the 40-year maximum) just how much time he would actually serve. <i>See Derman v. United States,</i> 298 F.3d 34, 42-43 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 537 U.S. 1048, 123 S.Ct. 636, 154 L.Ed.2d 522 (2002). The guideline range is driven, in drug cases, primarily by quantity (together with criminal history category).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A jury determination as to the quantity of drugs for which the defendant is responsible does not prevent the district court from finding a larger amount in the course of determining the guideline sentence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The reason is straightforward. In making its own quantity determination for the purpose of determining the statutory maximum, the jury asks what quantity has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>See Apprendi,</i> 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. By contrast, in fixing the guideline sentence, the district court is supposed to ask whether the government has proven the pertinent amount by a preponderance of the evidence. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Eirby,</i> 262 F.3d 31, 36-37 (1st Cir.2001). The judge could therefore quite rationally find an amount higher than was found by the jury. <i>See United States v. Watts,</i> 519 U.S. 148, 156, 117 S.Ct. 633, 136 L.Ed.2d 554 (1997) (per curiam).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admittedly, this is lawyers' logic. <i>Cf. Restatement (Second) of Judgments</i> &#167; 28(4) &amp; comment f (1982); <i>id.</i> &#167; 85, comment g. Many laymen, told that the jury's verdict was being ignored, would think that there was something wrong. Some might think this appearance problem is reason enough to change the law and &#8212; in the sensitive context of criminal sentencing &#8212; to respect the jury's finding <i>despite</i> the discrepancy in burdens of proof. But, as the law stands, the district judge is not only free to make his own independent finding but is essentially obliged to do so. <i>Edwards v. United States,</i> 523 U.S. 511, 514, 118 S.Ct. 1475, 140 L.Ed.2d 703 (1998) (guidelines \"require the judge to determine\" nature and quantity of drugs involved \"regardless of jury's actual, or assumed, beliefs\"); <i>cf. Watts,</i> 519 U.S. at 156, 117 S.Ct. 633 (sentence enhancement can be based on conduct acquitted by jury).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing, the district judge &#8212; although starting with the claim that he was \"bound\" by the jury's quantity determination &#8212; steadily backed away from that position under the force of the government's respectful argument. For example, when the district judge said he would create a legal issue if he departed from the jury's finding, the government explained that he would instead create one if he rested on that finding. In the end, the district court made a ruling that Picanso was responsible for 500 grams to 2 kilos, stating that he was \"not bound, but inclined\" to agree with the jury and that at least this ruling would be \"in harmony\" with the jury's verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the government argues that the district judge remained under the misapprehension that he either was bound by the jury's verdict or should at least give it substantial weight. If the former were true, this would clearly be legal error, <i>United States v. Tavano,</i> 12 F.3d 301, 307 (1st Cir.1993), and arguably so in the latter case, too, notwithstanding the seemingly contrary view of the Sixth Circuit, <i>United States v. Prior,</i> 941 F.2d 427, 430-31 (1991). But our own judgment, after a careful review of the full and extensive colloquy, is that the district judge got the message even though he did not like it. We are also confident that a remand on this point would not change the ultimate result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is a different question whether the district court's own finding that Picanso was liable for 500 grams to 2 kilograms is clear error. The government says that &#8212; at least under a preponderance standard &#8212; the evidence virtually compelled a finding that Picanso was responsible for 5 to 15 kilos. Put differently, the government says that it was clear error for the district court not to accept the recommendation of the probation officer. The difference in quantity is important: given Picanso's organizer adjustment and criminal history category, the first amount implicates a guideline range of 108-135 months; the latter 210-262 months. U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(c)(4), (7); <i>id.</i> Ch. 5, Pt. A.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is certainly a very good argument for the higher range urged by the government &#8212; and Picanso took a serious risk if he provoked the cross-appeal &#8212; but the facts are peculiar. The district court's smaller figure corresponds to hard evidence of direct sales; the government's larger ones are based on the PSR's rough extrapolation based on Picanso's ongoing involvement in drug dealing; on reports of what Picanso said, possibly in boasts; and on the belief that the funds seized from the house of Picanso's girlfriend were his own drug proceeds. If we were making our own finding, the combined weight of this evidence might well persuade us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet this time the \"clearly erroneous\" standard works in Picanso's favor. <i>See United States v. Rivera-Maldonado,</i> 194 F.3d 224, 228 n. 2 (1st Cir.1999) (\"broad discretion\" of district court); <i>Rivera,</i> 994 F.2d at 952. The appraisal of amount depends on inference drawing and perhaps credibility and we are not only loath but forbidden to substitute our own <i>de novo</i> assessment for that of the judge who tried the case and heard the evidence first hand. There were two close calls in this case &#8212; one as to role in the offense and the other as to amount. One went for the government and the other for Picanso.

On July 26, Picanso was convicted on the above-mentioned counts. By special verdict, the jury found Picanso responsible for at least 500 grams but less than 5 kilograms of cocaine, making him liable under the statute to a minimum sentence of 5 years and a maximum sentence of 40 years. 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing, the government recommended that the court find Picanso responsible for 5 to 15 kilograms of cocaine, equating under the guidelines to a base offense level (\"BOL\") of 32. U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(c)(4). It also sought a 4 level increase under section 3B1.1(a) which provides, \"If the defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive, increase [the offense level] by 4-levels.\" Both positions were supported by the probation officer's presentence report (\"PSR\"). The resulting total offense level (\"TOL\") of 36, coupled with Picanso's criminal history (category II), would have translated into a guideline sentencing range of 210-262 months. U.S.S.G.

As to the former, Picanso said that he was responsible for less than 5 kilos and he pointed to the jury's special verdict as implying its rejection of the government's position. The district court first said, \"You don't have to argue the jury verdict with me, I'm bound by it.\" After further discussion, described more fully below, the district court retreated somewhat from this position but still found Picanso responsible for between 500 grams and 2 kilos, resulting in a BOL of 26.

The result was a TOL of 30 and guideline range of 108-135 months. U.S.S.G. Ch. 5, Pt. A. The district court then sentenced Picanso to 122 months of imprisonment. Picanso appealed to contest the factual basis for the 4-level role enhancement, and the government countered by cross-appealing from the district court's ruling that Picanso was liable for only 500 grams to 2 kilos of cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Role Enhancement.</i> We begin with Picanso's appeal.

Picanso's position is that he was one independent drug dealer among many; he supplied many of the drug dealers that sold to end users, but (he says) they were all free agents and he exercised no control over them. The government seems to concede that Picanso was not a \"leader\" of a unified group of drug dealers, but argues nonetheless that he pulled the \"organizational strings\" by virtue of his control of the supply of cocaine. It relies among other decisions on <i>United States v. Tejada-Beltran,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"691951\"><a href=\"/opinion/691951/united-states-v-maximo-e-tejada-beltran-alias-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1995):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One may be classified as an organizer, though perhaps not as a leader, if he coordinates others so as to facilitate the commission of criminal activity.

Evidently he secured cocaine in bulk on trips to New York. According to the PSR, Picanso \"acquired kilograms of cocaine from his sources and ... broke down the kilograms into ounces and sold multiple ounces on a regular basis.\" After he distributed the drugs to retail dealers, they in turn would cut the cocaine and sell it to end users. Consistent with this description, it is also undisputed that Picanso was the \"primary cocaine supplier\" to these retail dealers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The greater quantities in which a wholesaler deals and his larger profits cannot alone trigger the role enhancement, <i>United States v.

The base offense level already takes quantity (and, implicitly, profit) into account, <i>id.</i> at 1222; and if quantity alone were enough, every wholesaler in a significant conspiracy with retailers would be characterized as an organizer or leader. Here, the retail dealers were free to purchase from others, and did so before, during, and after Picanso's arrival on the scene. Nevertheless, under <i>Tejada-Beltran,</i> a wholesaler even without full-scale control of his retailers could still \"coordinate[ ] others\" so as to \"facilitate\" the criminal activity. 50 F.3d at 112.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government points to several indicia to suggest a measure of control and coordination by Picanso. Several seem to us weak, at least in isolation. Yes, when other drug dealers called Picanso for a delivery, he would name a time and place for the transaction, but this <i>de minimis</i> planning is inherent in a criminal transaction involving more than one party. Nor does it distinguish Picanso from most sellers that as a formal matter he set the price and terms for his own sales. And, though some dealers regard Picanso as the \"king,\" the guideline commentary provides that \"titles such as `kingpin' or `boss' are not controlling,\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1, comment., n. 4, although the commentary does not say that the perceptions of co-conspirators are automatically irrelevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More helpful to the government is the report by a confidential witness (contained in the PSR) that Picanso boasted that he \"would shut [a co-defendant] down for good if [the co-defendant] messed up again.\" The ability to regulate participation in the local drug trade is surely an indicium of power and control. This statement was not introduced at trial, and Picanso questions whether the sentencing judge actually relied on it, but sentencing decisions can rest on facts contained in the PSR and obvious evidence in the record supporting the district court's ultimate finding is sufficient. <i>Cruz,</i> 120 F.3d at 2; <i>see also United States v. Medina,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198305\"><a href=\"/opinion/198305/united-states-v-medina/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">77</span></a></span>, 80 (1st Cir.1999) (no need for specific findings if evidence obvious).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was also some evidence that Picanso on at least one occasion arranged for a transfer of drugs that involved Picanso as supplier, one of his retailers, and an acquaintance of the retailer. How far this showed Picanso to be orchestrating downstream transactions is a matter of inference; but inference drawing is part of fact-finding confided to the district court. To the extent that Picanso was effectively supervising the arrangements for a sale by the retailer for further distribution, it becomes easier to describe him as an organizer of something more than his own wholesaling. <i>Cf. United States v. Brown,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200067\"><a href=\"/opinion/200067/united-states-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">298</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">120</span></a></span>, 123 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1096</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

To summarize, Picanso supplied a substantial network of retailers, set the terms for his own transactions with them, was regarded as the kingpin by other conspirators, and &#8212; drawing inferences in favor of the ultimate finding &#8212; had some influence over the operations of the retailers themselves. Probably this could be said of many wholesalers but not all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no mathematical formula for drawing the line on one side of which one can be called an organizer. Although there must be a core of facts to support the label and not pure intuition, the issue also turns in some measure on an overall assessment of the defendant's role based on an assemblage of detail. The district court, having presided over the trial and heard the evidence first hand, said he had no doubt that Picanso was the organizer. The trial judge has the advantage over us as to both the raw facts and the \"feel\" of the situation. <i>United States v.

These added up to less than a kilo, but the probation officer in the PSR recommended that Picanso be held responsible for between 5 and 15 kilos based crudely (there was no calculation) on the length of his involvement and frequency of sales, and on a few recorded or reported statements of Picanso.

The affidavit concluded that the cash represented the proceeds from between 44 and 82 kilos of cocaine. This assumes, plausibly but not assuredly, that the money was Picanso's and that he had no other source of income.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this background, the government on appeal objects to the district court's ruling attributing to Picanso only 500 grams to 2 kilos. Two arguments are offered: one is that the district court deemed itself bound or was overly influenced by the jury's special verdict; the other is that &#8212; whatever the jury believed &#8212; the evidence compelled a finding by the district court that for guideline purposes Picanso was responsible for 5 to 15 kilos. We address the arguments in this order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As already recounted, the district court said, at the outset of argument on the amount issue, that it was \"bound\" by the jury verdict holding Picanso responsible for at least 500 grams but less than 5 kilograms. This was true to the limited extent that under <i>Apprendi,</i> this finding fixed the <i>maximum</i> sentence permitted by the statute at 40 years; but it was false as to the proper determination of Picanso's guideline sentence which resolved (subject to the 40-year maximum) just how much time he would actually serve. <i>See Derman v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200045\"><a href=\"/opinion/200045/derman-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">298</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 42-43 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1048</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">522</span></span> (2002). The guideline range is driven, in drug cases, primarily by quantity (together with criminal history category).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A jury determination as to the quantity of drugs for which the defendant is responsible does not prevent the district court from finding a larger amount in the course of determining the guideline sentence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The reason is straightforward. In making its own quantity determination for the purpose of determining the statutory maximum, the jury asks what quantity has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>See Apprendi,</i> 530 U.S. at 490, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2348</span></a></span>. By contrast, in fixing the guideline sentence, the district court is supposed to ask whether the government has proven the pertinent amount by a preponderance of the evidence. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Eirby,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199580\"><a href=\"/opinion/199580/united-states-v-eirby/\"><span class=\"volume\">262</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span>, 36-37 (1st Cir.2001). The judge could therefore quite rationally find an amount higher than was found by the jury. <i>See United States v.

Many laymen, told that the jury's verdict was being ignored, would think that there was something wrong. Some might think this appearance problem is reason enough to change the law and &#8212; in the sensitive context of criminal sentencing &#8212; to respect the jury's finding <i>despite</i> the discrepancy in burdens of proof. But, as the law stands, the district judge is not only free to make his own independent finding but is essentially obliged to do so. <i>Edwards v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118200\"><a href=\"/opinion/118200/edwards-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span>, 514, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118200\"><a href=\"/opinion/118200/edwards-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Watts,</i> 519 U.S. at 156, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118073\"><a href=\"/opinion/118073/united-states-v-watts/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

For example, when the district judge said he would create a legal issue if he departed from the jury's finding, the government explained that he would instead create one if he rested on that finding. In the end, the district court made a ruling that Picanso was responsible for 500 grams to 2 kilos, stating that he was \"not bound, but inclined\" to agree with the jury and that at least this ruling would be \"in harmony\" with the jury's verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the government argues that the district judge remained under the misapprehension that he either was bound by the jury's verdict or should at least give it substantial weight. If the former were true, this would clearly be legal error, <i>United States v. Tavano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195113\"><a href=\"/opinion/195113/united-states-v-tavano/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">301</span></a></span>, 307 (1st Cir.1993), and arguably so in the latter case, too, notwithstanding the seemingly contrary view of the Sixth Circuit, <i>United States v. Prior,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566355\"><a href=\"/opinion/566355/united-states-v-eric-prior/\"><span class=\"volume\">941</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">427</span></a></span>, 430-31 (1991). But our own judgment, after a careful review of the full and extensive colloquy, is that the district judge got the message even though he did not like it. We are also confident that a remand on this point would not change the ultimate result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is a different question whether the district court's own finding that Picanso was liable for 500 grams to 2 kilograms is clear error. The government says that &#8212; at least under a preponderance standard &#8212; the evidence virtually compelled a finding that Picanso was responsible for 5 to 15 kilos. Put differently, the government says that it was clear error for the district court not to accept the recommendation of the probation officer. The difference in quantity is important: given Picanso's organizer adjustment and criminal history category, the first amount implicates a guideline range of 108-135 months; the latter 210-262 months. U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(c)(4), (7); <i>id.</i> Ch. 5, Pt. A.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is certainly a very good argument for the higher range urged by the government &#8212; and Picanso took a serious risk if he provoked the cross-appeal &#8212; but the facts are peculiar. The district court's smaller figure corresponds to hard evidence of direct sales; the government's larger ones are based on the PSR's rough extrapolation based on Picanso's ongoing involvement in drug dealing; on reports of what Picanso said, possibly in boasts; and on the belief that the funds seized from the house of Picanso's girlfriend were his own drug proceeds. If we were making our own finding, the combined weight of this evidence might well persuade us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet this time the \"clearly erroneous\" standard works in Picanso's favor. <i>See United States v. Rivera-Maldonado,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198682\"><a href=\"/opinion/198682/united-states-v-rivera-maldonado/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></a></span>, 228 n. 2 (1st Cir.1999) (\"broad discretion\" of district court); <i>Rivera,</i> 994 F.2d at 952. The appraisal of amount depends on inference drawing and perhaps credibility and we are not only loath but forbidden to substitute our own <i>de novo</i> assessment for that of the judge who tried the case and heard the evidence first hand. There were two close calls in this case &#8212; one as to role in the offense and the other as to amount. One went for the government and the other for Picanso. Someone has to have the last word on close calls as to the facts and it is right that it should be the district judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The money was seized from a safe in his girlfriend's house well after Picanso's arrest and, sensibly, he made no effort in the forfeiture proceeding to claim the money as his.
