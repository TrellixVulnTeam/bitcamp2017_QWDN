Salvador E. Casellas, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                       Selya, Circuit Judge,\n              Coffin and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Héctor J. Benítez Arraiza and Llovet Zurinaga & López, P.S.C.\non brief for appellants.\n\n\n\n                            December 3, 2004\n\f           Per Curiam.     Juan Milete Medero (Milete) arrived at\n\nHospital Dr. Susoni, Inc. (HDS) complaining of chest pain.                 A\n\nbattery of tests were performed in the emergency room and Milete\n\nwas then discharged.     He died a few days later.\n\n           Milete's heirs brought suit in the federal district court\n\nagainst HDS, AM Care (a firm that allegedly managed the emergency\n\nroom), and their respective insurers.         The gravamen of the action\n\nwas the allegation that HDS and/or AM Care failed to perform\n\nadequate   screening,    neglected    to   stabilize   the   decedent,   and\n\nprematurely discharged him in violation of the Emergency Medical\n\nTreatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA), 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd (2003).\n\nThe defendants denied the material allegations of the complaint.\n\nIn due course, the district court granted a motion for summary\n\njudgment filed by HDS and its insurer (St. Paul Fire & Marine\n\nInsurance Co.).   The court dismissed the action with prejudice as\n\nto all the defendants.\n\n           The plaintiffs appealed. While their appeal was pending,\n\nthe plaintiffs, HDS, and St. Paul negotiated a settlement.               The\n\nterms of the settlement are obscure, and the parties apparently\n\ndisagree as to whether the settlement abrogated the plaintiffs'\n\nclaims against AM Care and its insurer (Reliance Insurance Co.).\n\nIn consequence of the settlement, we entered an order dismissing\n\nthe appeal vis-à-vis HDS and St. Paul.          Appellate courts lack a\n\nmechanism for factfinding, however, and the dispute as to whether\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fthe settlement     has   a   broader    reach    remains   unresolved.   The\n\nplaintiffs' appeal is still pending as to AM Care and Reliance.\n\n            The plaintiffs desire to press forward with what remains\n\nof their appeal.    AM Care and Reliance, apparently believing that\n\nthe claims against them were extinguished by the settlement, have\n\nnot filed a brief.       To complicate matters, the plaintiffs' brief,\n\nfiled prior to the consummation of the settlement, addresses only\n\nthe claims against HDS and St. Paul.              It does not specifically\n\naddress the more nuanced claims advanced against AM Care and\n\nReliance.    We say \"more nuanced\" because it is unclear whether AM\n\nCare — a non-hospital health care provider — is a proper defendant\n\nunder EMTALA.1\n\n            In the present posture of the case, we think that the\n\ncourse of prudence is summarily to vacate the judgment below as to\n\nAM Care and its insurer and remand to the district court for\n\nfurther proceedings.         See 1st Cir. R. 27(c).          On remand, the\n\ndistrict court first should explore the scope of the settlement and\n\ndetermine whether it extinguished the plaintiffs' claims against AM\n\nCare and its insurer.          If so,        the court should dismiss the\n\nremaining claims on that ground.\n\n            If, however, the claims against AM Care and its insurer\n\nsurvive the settlement, the court should then resolve the statutory\n\n\n     1\n      The district court noted this question and directed the\nparties to brief it. After receiving the parties' memoranda, the\ncourt never resolved the question.\n\n                                       -3-\n\fconstruction question, namely, whether EMTALA applies to non-\n\nhospital providers like AM Care.      If the court answers that query\n\naffirmatively, it next should proceed to address the EMTALA claims\n\non the merits and enter judgment accordingly.       But if the court\n\nanswers the statutory construction question in the negative, it\n\nshould dismiss the claims against AM Care and its insurer without\n\nprejudice for want of federal subject matter jurisdiction.\n\n          We add two caveats.   First, our vacation of the judgment\n\nneither applies to HDS and St. Paul nor affects the earlier order\n\ndismissing the appeal as to those parties.    That aspect of the case\n\nis finished.   Second, we intimate no view as to the ultimate\n\nresolution of any of the issues that must be vetted on remand.\n\nHaving mapped the terrain, we need go no further.\n\n          Vacated and remanded.    All parties shall bear their own\n\ncosts.\n\n\n\n\n                                -4-\n\f",
