GONZALES,\n                   UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL,\n\n                             Respondent.\n\n\n\n\n              ON PETITION FOR REVIEW OF AN ORDER OF THE\n\n                    BOARD OF IMMIGRATION APPEALS\n\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                      Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n\n                Selya and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Matthew S. Cameron, for petitioner.\n     Greg D. Mack, Senior Litigation Counsel, Office of Immigration\nLitigation, U.S. Department of Justice, with whom Peter D. Keisler,\nAssistant Attorney General, and Terri J. Scadron, Assistant\nDirector, were on brief for respondent.\n\n\n\n\n                         September 11, 2007\n\f          CYR, Senior Circuit Judge.    Seir Aminabed Cruz-Camey, a\n\nnative and citizen of Guatemala, petitions for review of an order\n\nof the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) vacating an immigration\n\njudge’s (IJ’s) decision to grant petitioner’s application for\n\ncancellation of removal.\n\n          Cruz-Camey entered the United States in 1995, was granted\n\nasylum, and in 1996 became a lawful permanent resident.         In March\n\n2004, he was arrested for driving under the influence (DUI) and for\n\npossession of cocaine.     Although these charges were continued\n\nwithout a finding, he was ordered to complete a substance abuse\n\nprogram during his one-year probationary sentence.         Within the\n\nyear, however, petitioner once again was arrested for DUI.         As a\n\nresult, the finding on the March 2004 charges was converted from\n\n“no finding” to “guilty,” he received and served a thirty-day\n\nsentence, and his driver’s license was revoked.     In November 2005,\n\npetitioner was arrested a third time on DUI charges, whereupon he\n\nreceived a six-month sentence for his second DUI conviction, and\n\ntwenty-four months for the third DUI conviction (with sixteen\n\nmonths suspended).\n\n          In   March   2006,   Cruz-Camey   was   placed   in    removal\n\nproceedings, based on his 2004 conviction for cocaine possession.\n\nSee 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i). Petitioner conceded removability,\n\nbut applied for cancellation of removal on the ground that his\n\nsubstance abuse and arrests stemmed from a treatable and transitory\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fbout of depression.    Following an evidentiary hearing, the IJ\n\ngranted the petitioner’s application for cancellation of removal,\n\nciting, inter alia, his acceptance of responsibility for the\n\ndangerousness of his criminal conduct, his close family ties and\n\ngainful employment in the United States, as well as his promises\n\nactively to continue substance-abuse rehabilitation.    On appeal,\n\nhowever, the BIA vacated the grant of cancellation, finding no\n\naffirmative record evidence that Cruz-Camey either had undertaken\n\nor would undertake genuine efforts at rehabilitation, then ordered\n\nCruz-Camey removed from the United States.    In due course, Cruz-\n\nCamey petitioned for review of the BIA decision.1\n\n          Cruz-Camey   has    conceded   removability    under   §\n\n1227(a)(2)(B)(i).   Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), the Secretary\n\nhas the discretion to cancel removal, and absent any colorable\n\nconstitutional issue or question of law, we lack jurisdiction to\n\nreview the Secretary's exercise vel non of that discretion, see id.\n\n§ 1252(a)(2)(B)(i), 1252(a)(2)(C); Elysee v. Gonzales, 437 F.3d\n\n221, 223 (1st Cir. 2006).     The Cruz-Camey petition for review\n\nraises no such colorable constitutional or legal issue,2 but merely\n\n\n     1\n      In November 2006, we denied a motion to stay petitioner's\nremoval pending the outcome of this petition for review, citing our\nprobable lack of appellate jurisdiction, and petitioner is no\nlonger in the United States.\n     2\n      In an effort to circumvent the jurisdictional bar, Cruz-Camey\nunsuccessfully attempts to recast his challenge to the BIA’s\ndiscretionary judgment as a \"due process\" claim. That effort will\nnot wash. See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, 424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th\n\n                               -3-\n\fchallenges    the    manner    in   which    the   BIA    balanced    the   various\n\npositive and negative factors which typically inform the exercise\n\nof its discretion under § 1229b(a). Id. (noting that challenges to\n\nthe BIA’s balancing of the equities and other “cancellation”\n\ncriteria cannot be reviewed under § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i)).                      We lack\n\njurisdiction to reach the merits of this claim.\n\n            The petitioner presents but one legal argument: that the\n\nBIA acted ultra vires in not only vacating the IJ’s cancellation of\n\nremoval, but in also affirmatively ordering petitioner removed from\n\nthe United States.          Petitioner insists that only the IJ has the\n\nauthority to enter such an order in the first instance, and that\n\nthe BIA should have remanded the case to the IJ for further\n\nproceedings on the removability issue.                That rationale has been\n\nadopted by but one circuit court.            See Molina-Camacho v. Ashcroft,\n\n393 F.3d 937, 940-41 (9th Cir. 2004).              Almost simultaneously with\n\nthe oral argument in the case at bar, however, an en banc panel of\n\nthe Ninth Circuit expressly overruled Molina-Camacho.                   Lolong v.\n\nGonzales, 484 F.3d 1173, 1177 (9th Cir. 2007) (en banc) (noting\n\nthat   an   IJ’s    order    cancelling     removal      implicitly   includes    a\n\nthreshold determination that the petitioner is otherwise subject to\n\nremoval, and a BIA reversal of cancellation simply reinstates the\n\n\nCir. 2005) (noting that “traditional abuse of discretion challenges\nrecast as alleged due process violations do not constitute\ncolorable    constitutional   claims   that    would   invoke   our\njurisdiction”).\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fIJ’s implicit order of removability); see also Lazo v. Gonzales,\n\n462 F.3d 53, 54-55 (2d Cir. 2006); Delgado-Reynua v. Gonzales, 450\n\nF.3d 596, 600-01 (5th Cir. 2006).         We find the unanimous reasoning\n\nof   our   sister   circuits   on   this     matter   unimpeachable,   and\n\naccordingly reject the Cruz-Camey ultra vires argument.\n\n          The portion of the petition seeking review of the BIA’s\ndiscretionary denial of cancellation of removal is dismissed for\nwant of appellate jurisdiction, and the remainder of the petition\nis denied on the merits.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f",
