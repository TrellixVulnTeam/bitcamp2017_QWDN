This is an appeal from an order\n\ndismissing with prejudice a medical malpractice action brought by\n\nRosa M. Arroyo-Velázquez (\"Arroyo\") and other family members; the\n\ndismissal was based on their attorney's failure to comply with case\n\nmanagement orders.   The primary defendants were Hospital Hermanos\n\nMelendez, Inc. (\"the hospital\"), which operates a facility in\n\nBayamon, Puerto Rico, several of its doctors, and unnamed insurers.\n\nThe background is as follows.\n\n          On August 5, 1997, Arroyo underwent surgery at the\n\nhospital for an ovarian cyst.     Serious complications ensued and\n\nseveral further operations were performed at the hospital; if\n\nArroyo's account is credited, there were serious medical blunders,\n\nconsiderable suffering and permanent impairments.   In due course,\n\nshe left the Hospital and began treatment at the Johns Hopkins\n\nHospital in Baltimore (\"Johns Hopkins\"). In November 1999, she and\n\nher co-plaintiffs brought this diversity action in federal court\n\nagainst the defendants.\n\n          A statute of limitations defense was asserted--the Puerto\n\nRico statute is one year, 31 P.R. Laws Ann. § 5298(2) (1990)--and,\n\nafter multiple extensions of time, opposed by the plaintiffs in\n\nAugust 2000.   It is not clear how much, if any, discovery was\n\nconducted in this initial period–-seemingly not much.       In all\n\nevents in October 2000, the statute of limitations defense was\n\nrejected by the district court, apparently because a prior action\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fhad been brought in state court and dismissed without prejudice,\n\nthereby tolling the limitations period.            See 31 P.R. Laws Ann. §\n\n5303 (1990); King v. TL Dallas & Co., 270 F. Supp. 2d 262, 270\n\n(D.P.R. 2003).\n\n            There followed two years of fumbling trial preparation\n\nuntil the case was finally dismissed by the district court on\n\nAugust 19, 2002.         To recount all of the pertinent discovery\n\nproblems and protests would take pages, but it appears that from\n\nthe outset Arroyo's trial counsel (not her counsel on this appeal)\n\nfound it difficult to meet ordinary discovery obligations; this he\n\nattributed in part to unspecified family problems of his own during\n\nthe   initial    year.     Because    most    of   the    trial   preparation\n\ndifficulties are only background for the later dismissal, it is\n\nenough to summarize the main themes.\n\n            First, it is often hard to find doctors to testify\n\nagainst other doctors, and apparently especially hard in this case.\n\nBut Arroyo's counsel compounded the problem by naming successive\n\nexperts and then having to replace them, either because they had\n\nnever committed themselves or because they withdrew.1                 He also\n\nfailed to produce expert reports on time and had difficulties in\n\nproducing   promised     experts   for     depositions.     Of    course,   the\n\n\n      1\n      In the summer of 2001, plaintiffs represented to the court\nthat, after Dr. Mark Talamini, one of Arroyo's treating physicians\nat Johns Hopkins, had refused to be their expert witness, they had\ncontacted some twenty-five doctors before finally finding a\nreplacement.\n\n                                     -3-\n\fdefendants' own retention and preparation of experts were hostage\n\nto these delays.\n\n          Second, for obvious reasons the defendants wanted to\n\nprocure Arroyo's treatment records from the time she had spent at\n\nJohns Hopkins.     The records were arguably relevant to her past\n\ntreatment at the defendant hospital and to her suffering and\n\ncurrent condition; in addition, one of her treating physicians at\n\nJohns Hopkins was initially named as an expert and then (when he\n\ndisclaimed this status) as a fact witness for Arroyo.        These\n\nrecords were the subject of discovery requests directed to Arroyo\n\nand, perhaps foolishly, her counsel repeatedly undertook to provide\n\nthe records–-although they were not in Arroyo's direct control--and\n\nrepeatedly failed to produce the full collection.\n\n          Third, Arroyo's counsel appears to have had trouble\n\ncompleting interrogatory answers.     Here, the details are less\n\nclear; possibly some of the answers depended on expert witness\n\npositions or medical records that were themselves difficult to\n\nobtain.   It is undisputed that even by the beginning of May 2001,\n\nalmost a year and a half after the complaint was filed, plaintiffs\n\nhad failed to answer adequately various defendants' interrogatories\n\nor document requests, all of which had been sent to them many\n\nmonths before.\n\n           After disposing of the statute of limitations issue in\n\nOctober 2000, the district court set a final pretrial conference\n\n\n                                -4-\n\ffor February 27, 2001, with trial for May 24, 2001.   This schedule\n\nwas several times postponed, usually at the defendants' behest\n\nbecause of Arroyo's delays in furnishing the expert reports,\n\nmedical records, and interrogatory answers.        There were also\n\ndeposition scheduling difficulties for which blame is less easily\n\napportioned.\n\n          In response to these problems, the defendants followed a\n\ndual track.    On the one hand, they filed motions to compel and, as\n\nthe delays impinged on their preparation, motions to reschedule\n\npre-trial conferences and trial dates.      On the other hand, the\n\ndefendants also filed successive motions over a two-year period to\n\ndismiss the complaint based on the failure of Arroyo's counsel to\n\nmeet deadlines.2     For a time, the district court denied such\n\nrequests on technical grounds or without explanation, although a\n\nsmall monetary penalty was imposed on Arroyo's counsel for not\n\nproviding timely answers to interrogatories.\n\n          Gradually, in the second half of 2001 and early 2002\n\nArroyo began to accumulate expert reports,3 although the Johns\n\n\n     2\n      Motions or supplements to motions enlarging on the requests\nfor dismissal appear to have been filed by one or more of the\ndefendants on or about: April 23, 2001; April 27, 2001; May 3,\n2001; May 18, 2001; June 19, 2001; November 29, 2001; December 6,\n2001; December 12, 2001; January 25, 2002; and June 18, 2002.\n     3\n      Dr. José Gratacós (gynecology) filed an expert report on\nAugust 31, 2001.   Dr. Antonio González (an economist) filed an\nexpert report on January 8, 2002, relating to the extent of Mrs.\nArroyo's financial damages. Dr. Virgilio Brunet-Cardona (general\nsurgery) filed an expert report on February 14, 2002.\n\n                                 -5-\n\fHopkins records and depositions of the experts remained in arrears.\n\nOn February 14, 2002, a date scheduled for a final pretrial\n\nconference, the parties met with the court to work out further\n\ndiscovery plans. The court ordered Arroyo to produce the remaining\n\nJohns Hopkins documents including progress notes, physician orders\n\nand nurses' notes within 30 days.             Arroyo's counsel was told that\n\nthe failure to produce would result in sanctions.\n\n             In   the   same    hearing    the   district    court   noted   that\n\ndepositions of three doctors to be called by Arroyo (Drs. José\n\nGratacós and Virgilio Brunet-Cardona as experts and Dr. Mark\n\nTalamini as a fact witness) and one economics expert (Dr. Antonio\n\nGonzalez) were now scheduled on specific dates from May 14, 2002,\n\nthrough June 27, 2002.         The court   gave the defendants until August\n\n30, 2002, to name their own experts and the court set a new\n\npretrial conference for October 30, 2002, warning that no further\n\ncontinuances would be allowed and that sanctions would follow if\n\nanyone impeded the proceedings further.\n\n             In June 2002, the hospital moved to compel discovery or\n\nto dismiss the case because the Johns Hopkins records had still not\n\nbeen produced in full and because the deposition of Arroyo's\n\nphysician    fact   witness,      Dr.   Mark     Talamini,   had   been   further\n\ndeferred.4    In August 2002, another defendant moved to defer the\n\n\n     4\n      In the same month, another one of the defendant doctors, Dr.\nOlga Rodríguez-Rivera, obtained an unopposed dismissal of the\nclaims against her because the expert reports offered no theory of\n\n                                        -6-\n\fdeadline for naming his own experts because the deposition of an\n\nArroyo    expert      witness,    Dr.   Virgilio    Brunet-Cardona,       had   been\n\ndeferred.       In both instances the witnesses were among the four\n\nwhose    deposition      dates    had   been     listed   in    the    February   14\n\nconference minutes and in both cases the defendant blamed Arroyo's\n\ncounsel for the deferral.\n\n            On August 19, 2002, the district court entered an order\n\ndismissing plaintiffs' case against all of the remaining defendants\n\nunder    Rule    16(f)   for     \"failure   to   abide    by   the    Court's   case\n\nmanagement schedule.\"          The court noted that the pending motions by\n\nthe hospital and Martinez were unanswered by the plaintiffs, and\n\nrecounted       the   defendants'    allegations     that      the    missing   Johns\n\nHopkins documents had not been produced, that plaintiffs had\n\n\"failed to arrange for the deposition of Dr. Talimani (sic) to be\n\ntaken on June 27, 2002, as ordered by the Court,\" and that \"the\n\ndeposition of Dr. Virgilio Brunet which was scheduled by the Court\n\nfor May 14, 2002, was cancelled by plaintiffs and rescheduled for\n\nAugust 1, 2002.\"\n\n            The court then said:\n\n                   The record is plagued with instances of\n            non-compliance   by   plaintiffs   and   their\n            attorney with discovery deadlines and Court's\n            Orders. For the most part, the Court has been\n            tolerant, although it did previously sanction\n            plaintiffs' attorney in the amount of $600.00\n            for his untimely submission of answers to\n\n\nwrongdoing directed against her.\n\n                                         -7-\n\f            interrogatories.    The Court had observed\n            before that plaintiffs had evidenced a\n            \"continuing pattern of delays.\"      It only\n            appears to have progressed for the worse.\n\n                   These latest incidents reported by\n            movants in their motions only serve to\n            demonstrate plaintiffs' contumacious disregard\n            for the discovery schedule and deadlines\n            established by the Court. They have seriously\n            hampered defendants' preparation for trial,\n            and in so doing have disrupted the orderly\n            progress of this case toward its resolution.\n            Clearly, they merit the imposition of the\n            harshest of sanctions: dismissal.\n\n            On August 28, 2002, Arroyo's counsel filed a motion to\n\nalter or amend the judgment.     Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e).       He said that\n\nthe reason the most recent motions to dismiss and compel had not\n\nbeen answered was that they had been sent to his former address and\n\nnot to a new one identified by him in May 2001 in an informative\n\nmotion.    Counsel also offered explanations for the rescheduling of\n\nthe depositions and said that he had already given the defense in\n\nMarch 2002 all of the Johns Hopkins documents he could obtain.\n\n            The defendants filed an opposition to the Rule 59 motion,\n\narguing on the basis of circumstantial evidence that Arroyo's\n\ncounsel had likely received the motions at his old address.             The\n\noppositions also quarreled in detail with counsel's ameliorating\n\nexplanations for the deposition delays.          The defense also asserted\n\nthat the    Johns   Hopkins   documents   were    still   incomplete.    On\n\nNovember 18, 2002, the district court denied the motion without\n\nopinion, making no findings on any of the disputed points (e.g.,\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fwhether      counsel        had    received      the   motions),      and     this    appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n              The cases commonly say that a dismissal for failure to\n\ncomply with scheduling orders is tested on appeal under an abuse of\n\ndiscretion       standard.          E.g.,      Tower   Ventures,      Inc.    v.     City   of\n\nWestfield, 296 F.3d 43, 46 (1st Cir. 2002).                          Strictly speaking,\n\nthis     test    applies          primarily      to    the    overall        balancing      of\n\nconsiderations pro and con, such as the extent and repetitive\n\ncharacter       of    the    defaults,         deliberateness,       prejudice       to     the\n\nopposing party, adequate warning, and a range of similar common\n\nsense concerns.        See Robson v. Hallenbeck, 81 F.3d 1, 2-3 (1st Cir.\n\n1996).\n\n              In this case, we are concerned primarily with a judgment\n\ncall   but      one   that        rests   in    substantial        measure    on   disputed\n\nassumptions of facts; indeed, appellants' main attack is primarily\n\nupon those assumptions.               If there are pertinent factual findings\n\nunderpinning a dismissal or pure issues of law raised by the\n\nappeal,      these     issues       are     tested     by    the    ordinary       standards\n\n(respectively, clear error and de novo review).                          See Cameron v.\n\nOtto Bock Orthopedic Indus., 43 F.3d 14, 16 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n              In dismissing the case, the district court's initial\n\njudgment was surely colored by the failure of Arroyo's counsel to\n\nrespond to the final motions to dismiss or compel. Yet there\n\nappears to be no dispute that Arroyo's counsel had moved his office\n\n\n                                               -9-\n\fand had provided notice, and that, according to their respective\n\ncertificates of service, the motions in question were mailed to the\n\nwrong address.   In the Rule 59 motion, Arroyo's counsel flatly\n\ndenied receiving them; the defendants in response offered some\n\ninference evidence to the contrary,5 but no explicit findings were\n\nmade by the district court.\n\n          If counsel did receive the papers and failed to answer,\n\nthis last straw after a history of delays would be fatal.   Yet on\n\nthis record we cannot ourselves conclude that he did receive the\n\ndocuments and we are unwilling to impute such a finding to the\n\ndistrict judge based on her summary denial of Arroyo's Rule 59\n\nmotion; sometimes an implicit finding is obviously intended or\n\ninferable but in this case it would have been hard to resolve the\n\ndispute without an evidentiary hearing.   Yet, it is not clear that\n\nthe counsel's failure to respond to the defendants' motions was\n\nintended by the judge as a specific reason for the dismissal.\n\n          Based on the dismissal order, the district judge may have\n\nbeen principally concerned with the failures as to deposition\n\n\n     5\n      Defendants claim that at least some of the correspondence\nthat they sent to the wrong address was received by plaintiffs'\ncounsel, as evidenced by a deposition notice that they sent to\ncounsel's old address on May 22, 2002, and which counsel\nsubsequently forwarded on to Dr. Talamini on May 29, 2002.\nDefendants also claim that none of the motions were returned to\nthem as undeliverable. In addition, counsel for defendant Martinez\nfiled an affidavit from his secretary, in which the secretary says\nthat the August 2002 motion to request an extension of time for\nnotifying expert witnesses was in fact sent to the correct address\ndespite the wrong address appearing on the certificate of service.\n\n                               -10-\n\fscheduling and document production that her dismissal order had\n\nidentified.   And, conceivably, the judge found the explanations\n\ngiven by Arroyo's counsel in the Rule 59 motion to be inadequate to\n\nexcuse these scheduling and production gaffes and, against the\n\nbackground of prior delays, found this enough to justify the\n\ndismissal--whether or not counsel's failure to answer the motions\n\nwas excusable.\n\n           If all of the district court's expressed concerns as to\n\nscheduling and production were borne out by supportable findings or\n\neven by record evidence identified by the defendants, we would\n\naffirm.   Given the record of delays by plaintiffs' counsel and the\n\ncourt's clear warning on February 14, 2002, three post-warning\n\ndefaults would be enough to justify the dismissal, severe though\n\nthe sanction would be.    But, once again, the situation is more\n\ncomplicated than appears on the surface.\n\n           The weakest of the charges–-at least on this record--is\n\nthat Arroyo's counsel violated the court's scheduling order by\n\nfailing to produce Dr. Talamini for deposition on June 27, 2002.\n\nThe court's dismissal order said that at the February 14, 2002,\n\nconference, \"[p]laintiffs were [] ordered to arrange for the\n\ndepositions of two of their experts [Drs. Talamini and Brunet] on\n\nMay 14, 2002 and June 27, 2002, respectively.\"   On appeal, Arroyo\n\nobjects that there was no formal order to this effect; rather,\n\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\falong with other formal orders, the \"minutes of proceedings\" simply\n\nlist the depositions and dates.\n\n          With or without a formal order, the minutes reflect the\n\nschedule as an understanding of the court and the parties; thus, an\n\nunjustified   failure   to   carry   through   could   reasonably   be\n\nsanctioned.   The difficulty is that Dr. Talamini was not an expert\n\nwitness biddable by plaintiffs' counsel but, at least by 2002,\n\nmerely a fact witness designated by Arroyo.      Ordinarily, it would\n\nbe defense counsels' job to subpoena such a witness for deposition.\n\nHere, defendants seem to be arguing that Arroyo's counsel had\n\nrepresented to them that he could produce Dr. Talamini on the\n\nspecified date and then failed to carry through.\n\n          In his Rule 59 motion, Arroyo's counsel explained (and\n\nthe record confirms) that he had had great difficulty in getting\n\nthe doctor to cooperate.     However, whether Arroyo's counsel made\n\ncommitments or representations that he should not have made and\n\ncould not keep is much less clear.     Without that, defendants do not\n\nget very far by blaming Arroyo's counsel for failure to move\n\npromptly after the February conference to nail down Dr. Talamini's\n\nagreement to appear.    There are no findings by the district court\n\non this issue.\n\n          As to Dr. Brunet, he was an expert witness for Arroyo, so\n\nArroyo's counsel had a responsibility to produce him for the\n\nscheduled deposition listed in the court's order, cf. Barrett v.\n\n\n                                -12-\n\fAtl. Richfield Co., 95 F.3d 375, 380-81 (5th Cir. 1996), but it is\n\ncommon ground that the doctor failed to appear because he had to\n\nundertake an emergency surgery on the deposition date–-obviously\n\nsomething over which counsel had no control. The defense says that\n\nthe deposition should have been rescheduled more quickly (it\n\nfinally occurred on August 1, 2002) but it is hard to tell without\n\nfindings how far the re-scheduling delay was counsel's fault and\n\nhow far due to the doctor's own commitments.\n\n          The Johns Hopkins records are a different story.   Here,\n\nit is undisputed that Arroyo's counsel undertook to produce them,\n\nwas ordered finally to do so by the court within 30 days of\n\nFebruary 14, 2002, under threat of sanction, and never managed to\n\nproduce the complete set.6   So far as we can tell, counsel never\n\nshould have subjected himself to such a commitment; Arroyo did not\n\ncontrol the records directly and it would probably have been enough\n\nfor her counsel to provide a written release from her and leave it\n\nto the defense to depose Johns Hopkins and secure the records from\n\nit.\n\n          This is only partial mitigation.   Arroyo's counsel could\n\nnot promise to secure the records, fail to protest about the\n\n\n      6\n      Indeed, it appears that he had earlier been directed by court\norder of July 17, 2001, to produce the records within thirty days.\nBetween July 17, 2001, and February 14, 2002, plaintiffs' counsel\napparently failed to produce any additional documents. On March\n13, 2002, he produced some, but not all of the missing records, but\nthe extent of the remaining deficiency has never been addressed by\nthe district court.\n\n                               -13-\n\fobligation or time limits, and then excuse the failure to comply by\n\nsaying he had done his best.    Nor is it an answer that, after the\n\ndismissal, Arroyo's counsel said that his client had a year earlier\n\nprovided the defense with a general release granting access to her\n\nhospital   records.    Still,   there   is   no   finding   that   Arroyo\n\nultimately failed to produce any documents that he reasonably could\n\nhave or even that there presently exist any documents that Arroyo\n\nhas failed to produce.\n\n           Finally, the district court relied upon a background of\n\nprior delinquencies: \"[t]he record is plagued with instances of\n\nnon-compliance by plaintiffs and their attorney with discovery\n\ndeadlines and Court's Orders.\"      On appeal, Arroyo's appellate\n\ncounsel makes little attempt to challenge this characterization\n\nbeyond saying that the district court did not seriously sanction\n\nearlier defaults.     Given that there were earlier defaults as to\n\ndeadlines, this cuts more against Arroyo's position than in favor.\n\n           Our own unaided review of the record suggests that\n\nArroyo's counsel was regularly in default on small items;7 and, on\n\n\n\n     7\n      For example, Arroyo's counsel was late in filing a response\nto defendants' motion that plaintiffs be required to post a non-\nresident bond, and when the court finally did order the plaintiffs\nto post a bond, plaintiffs posted it late. Counsel also failed to\nanswer defendants' May 18, 2001, motion that the district court\nreconsider its decision on one of their previous motions to\ndismiss--this failure to respond prompted the district court to\norder the plaintiffs to show cause why the case should not be\ndismissed for lack of prosecution--plaintiffs finally filed their\nresponse on June 25, 2001. See also note 6 above.\n\n                                -14-\n\fone    occasion,       he    failed   to   appear    for      a    scheduled      pretrial\n\nconference, saying that his calendar was faulty.                        Further, counsel\n\nwas guilty of failures to meet discovery deadlines, seek necessary\n\nextensions, or even respond in timely fashion to defendants'\n\nfilings.\n\n            Ordinarily, we would affirm the dismissal where, as in\n\nthis    case,    the    plaintiff's        counsel   had      a    history     of    missed\n\ndeadlines and delays, was given a clear last chance warning and\n\ndefaulted again–-here by the failure to produce all of the Johns\n\nHopkins records.            This is so even though Arroyo may well have a\n\nserious medical malpractice claim, prejudice to the defendants from\n\nthe delay is unspecific, and the two doctors in question have now\n\nbeen deposed.      Trial courts cannot manage their heavy case loads\n\nunless appeals courts back them up against an attorney's disregard\n\nof deadlines.\n\n            But    in       this   instance      three   of       the   charges     against\n\nplaintiffs' counsel (failure to answer the motions and the two\n\ndelayed depositions) are simply insupportable without fact findings\n\nthat have       never       been   made;   the    fourth   charge        (Johns     Hopkins\n\nrecords) is borne out but involves partial compliance (perhaps as\n\nmuch as was possible).                What remains is only the charge that\n\nArroyo's counsel regularly missed deadlines, but it is not clear\n\nthat much that occurred after February 14, 2002, made the situation\n\nworse.\n\n\n                                           -15-\n\f           Despite the denial of the Rule 59 motion, we are far from\n\nclear that the district court would have exercised its discretion\n\nto dismiss if–-as may be the case-–(1) Arroyo's counsel never\n\nreceived the motions because defense counsel sent them to the wrong\n\naddress, (2) the court concluded that Arroyo's counsel was not at\n\nfault as to the deposition delays, and (3) the extent of counsel's\n\nefforts to secure the missing Johns Hopkins records were known.\n\n           Accordingly, because the dismissal rests on at least\n\nthree unsupported premises and some uncertainty attends the fourth,\n\nwe think it prudent to remand for further consideration.            Without\n\nlimiting the scope of the district court's authority, we note\n\nseveral options that are available.            The most obvious, if the\n\ndistrict   court   is   so   disposed,    is   to   determine   whether   the\n\nplaintiffs' counsel did receive the defense motions and failed to\n\nanswer, or was significantly at fault as to the scheduling of\n\ndepositions.   An affirmative supportable answer as to either would\n\nin our view adequately support the dismissal.\n\n           Alternatively, the district court is free to conclude\n\nthat these excavations into past history are more trouble than they\n\nare worth and to lay down strict conditions for the future conduct\n\nof the case.   These could include limitations on plaintiffs' proof\n\nor recovery if past delays have provably handicapped the defense;\n\nample latitude for the defense to complete their own discovery and\n\n\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\fpreparations; and a very tight rein on whichever counsel ends up\n\nrepresenting the plaintiffs in the district court.\n\n          Neither side has covered itself in glory in this case.\n\nIf the district judge does end up dismissing the claim, as she may,\n\nArroyo is well warranted in converting her medical malpractice\n\nclaim into one for possible legal malpractice. As for the defense,\n\nit has admittedly been abused by the toleration of past delays by\n\nArroyo's counsel; but if defense counsel had sent the motions to\n\nthe right address and so indicated on their certificates, the\n\npresent uncertainty would likely have been sorted out by now and\n\ngreatly simplified this appeal.\n\n          The   judgment   of   dismissal   as   to   Hospital   Hermanos\n\nMeléndez, Inc., Dr. Juan Martinez-Rodriguez, and Dr. Jesús Seda-\n\nRamírez is vacated and remanded for further proceedings consistent\n\nwith this opinion. This vacation does not reflect the dismissal of\n\nthe claims against Dr. Olga Rodríguez-Rivera, from which plaintiffs\n\nhave not appealed.    Each side shall bear its own costs on this\n\nappeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\f",

This is an appeal from an order\n\ndismissing with prejudice a medical malpractice action brought by\n\nRosa M. Arroyo-Velázquez (\"Arroyo\") and other family members; the\n\ndismissal was based on their attorney's failure to comply with case\n\nmanagement orders.   The primary defendants were Hospital Hermanos\n\nMelendez, Inc. (\"the hospital\"), which operates a facility in\n\nBayamon, Puerto Rico, several of its doctors, and unnamed insurers.\n\nThe background is as follows.\n\n          On August 5, 1997, Arroyo underwent surgery at the\n\nhospital for an ovarian cyst.     Serious complications ensued and\n\nseveral further operations were performed at the hospital; if\n\nArroyo's account is credited, there were serious medical blunders,\n\nconsiderable suffering and permanent impairments.   In due course,\n\nshe left the Hospital and began treatment at the Johns Hopkins\n\nHospital in Baltimore (\"Johns Hopkins\"). In November 1999, she and\n\nher co-plaintiffs brought this diversity action in federal court\n\nagainst the defendants.\n\n          A statute of limitations defense was asserted--the Puerto\n\nRico statute is one year, 31 P.R. Laws Ann. § 5298(2) (1990)--and,\n\nafter multiple extensions of time, opposed by the plaintiffs in\n\nAugust 2000.   It is not clear how much, if any, discovery was\n\nconducted in this initial period–-seemingly not much.       In all\n\nevents in October 2000, the statute of limitations defense was\n\nrejected by the district court, apparently because a prior action\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fhad been brought in state court and dismissed without prejudice,\n\nthereby tolling the limitations period.            See 31 P.R. Laws Ann. §\n\n5303 (1990); King v.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">262</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 270\n\n(D.P.R. 2003).\n\n            There followed two years of fumbling trial preparation\n\nuntil the case was finally dismissed by the district court on\n\nAugust 19, 2002.         To recount all of the pertinent discovery\n\nproblems and protests would take pages, but it appears that from\n\nthe outset Arroyo's trial counsel (not her counsel on this appeal)\n\nfound it difficult to meet ordinary discovery obligations; this he\n\nattributed in part to unspecified family problems of his own during\n\nthe   initial    year.     Because    most    of   the    trial   preparation\n\ndifficulties are only background for the later dismissal, it is\n\nenough to summarize the main themes.\n\n            First, it is often hard to find doctors to testify\n\nagainst other doctors, and apparently especially hard in this case.\n\nBut Arroyo's counsel compounded the problem by naming successive\n\nexperts and then having to replace them, either because they had\n\nnever committed themselves or because they withdrew.1                 He also\n\nfailed to produce expert reports on time and had difficulties in\n\nproducing   promised     experts   for     depositions.     Of    course,   the\n\n\n      1\n      In the summer of 2001, plaintiffs represented to the court\nthat, after Dr. Mark Talamini, one of Arroyo's treating physicians\nat Johns Hopkins, had refused to be their expert witness, they had\ncontacted some twenty-five doctors before finally finding a\nreplacement.\n\n                                     -3-\n\fdefendants' own retention and preparation of experts were hostage\n\nto these delays.\n\n          Second, for obvious reasons the defendants wanted to\n\nprocure Arroyo's treatment records from the time she had spent at\n\nJohns Hopkins.     The records were arguably relevant to her past\n\ntreatment at the defendant hospital and to her suffering and\n\ncurrent condition; in addition, one of her treating physicians at\n\nJohns Hopkins was initially named as an expert and then (when he\n\ndisclaimed this status) as a fact witness for Arroyo.        These\n\nrecords were the subject of discovery requests directed to Arroyo\n\nand, perhaps foolishly, her counsel repeatedly undertook to provide\n\nthe records–-although they were not in Arroyo's direct control--and\n\nrepeatedly failed to produce the full collection.\n\n          Third, Arroyo's counsel appears to have had trouble\n\ncompleting interrogatory answers.     Here, the details are less\n\nclear; possibly some of the answers depended on expert witness\n\npositions or medical records that were themselves difficult to\n\nobtain.   It is undisputed that even by the beginning of May 2001,\n\nalmost a year and a half after the complaint was filed, plaintiffs\n\nhad failed to answer adequately various defendants' interrogatories\n\nor document requests, all of which had been sent to them many\n\nmonths before.\n\n           After disposing of the statute of limitations issue in\n\nOctober 2000, the district court set a final pretrial conference\n\n\n                                -4-\n\ffor February 27, 2001, with trial for May 24, 2001.   This schedule\n\nwas several times postponed, usually at the defendants' behest\n\nbecause of Arroyo's delays in furnishing the expert reports,\n\nmedical records, and interrogatory answers.        There were also\n\ndeposition scheduling difficulties for which blame is less easily\n\napportioned.\n\n          In response to these problems, the defendants followed a\n\ndual track.    On the one hand, they filed motions to compel and, as\n\nthe delays impinged on their preparation, motions to reschedule\n\npre-trial conferences and trial dates.      On the other hand, the\n\ndefendants also filed successive motions over a two-year period to\n\ndismiss the complaint based on the failure of Arroyo's counsel to\n\nmeet deadlines.2     For a time, the district court denied such\n\nrequests on technical grounds or without explanation, although a\n\nsmall monetary penalty was imposed on Arroyo's counsel for not\n\nproviding timely answers to interrogatories.\n\n          Gradually, in the second half of 2001 and early 2002\n\nArroyo began to accumulate expert reports,3 although the Johns\n\n\n     2\n      Motions or supplements to motions enlarging on the requests\nfor dismissal appear to have been filed by one or more of the\ndefendants on or about: April 23, 2001; April 27, 2001; May 3,\n2001; May 18, 2001; June 19, 2001; November 29, 2001; December 6,\n2001; December 12, 2001; January 25, 2002; and June 18, 2002.\n     3\n      Dr. José Gratacós (gynecology) filed an expert report on\nAugust 31, 2001.   Dr. Antonio González (an economist) filed an\nexpert report on January 8, 2002, relating to the extent of Mrs.\nArroyo's financial damages. Dr. Virgilio Brunet-Cardona (general\nsurgery) filed an expert report on February 14, 2002.\n\n                                 -5-\n\fHopkins records and depositions of the experts remained in arrears.\n\nOn February 14, 2002, a date scheduled for a final pretrial\n\nconference, the parties met with the court to work out further\n\ndiscovery plans. The court ordered Arroyo to produce the remaining\n\nJohns Hopkins documents including progress notes, physician orders\n\nand nurses' notes within 30 days.             Arroyo's counsel was told that\n\nthe failure to produce would result in sanctions.\n\n             In   the   same    hearing    the   district    court   noted   that\n\ndepositions of three doctors to be called by Arroyo (Drs. José\n\nGratacós and Virgilio Brunet-Cardona as experts and Dr. Mark\n\nTalamini as a fact witness) and one economics expert (Dr. Antonio\n\nGonzalez) were now scheduled on specific dates from May 14, 2002,\n\nthrough June 27, 2002.         The court   gave the defendants until August\n\n30, 2002, to name their own experts and the court set a new\n\npretrial conference for October 30, 2002, warning that no further\n\ncontinuances would be allowed and that sanctions would follow if\n\nanyone impeded the proceedings further.\n\n             In June 2002, the hospital moved to compel discovery or\n\nto dismiss the case because the Johns Hopkins records had still not\n\nbeen produced in full and because the deposition of Arroyo's\n\nphysician    fact   witness,      Dr.   Mark     Talamini,   had   been   further\n\ndeferred.4    In August 2002, another defendant moved to defer the\n\n\n     4\n      In the same month, another one of the defendant doctors, Dr.\nOlga Rodríguez-Rivera, obtained an unopposed dismissal of the\nclaims against her because the expert reports offered no theory of\n\n                                        -6-\n\fdeadline for naming his own experts because the deposition of an\n\nArroyo    expert      witness,    Dr.   Virgilio    Brunet-Cardona,       had   been\n\ndeferred.       In both instances the witnesses were among the four\n\nwhose    deposition      dates    had   been     listed   in    the    February   14\n\nconference minutes and in both cases the defendant blamed Arroyo's\n\ncounsel for the deferral.\n\n            On August 19, 2002, the district court entered an order\n\ndismissing plaintiffs' case against all of the remaining defendants\n\nunder    Rule    16(f)   for     \"failure   to   abide    by   the    Court's   case\n\nmanagement schedule.\"          The court noted that the pending motions by\n\nthe hospital and Martinez were unanswered by the plaintiffs, and\n\nrecounted       the   defendants'    allegations     that      the    missing   Johns\n\nHopkins documents had not been produced, that plaintiffs had\n\n\"failed to arrange for the deposition of Dr. Talimani (sic) to be\n\ntaken on June 27, 2002, as ordered by the Court,\" and that \"the\n\ndeposition of Dr. Virgilio Brunet which was scheduled by the Court\n\nfor May 14, 2002, was cancelled by plaintiffs and rescheduled for\n\nAugust 1, 2002.\"\n\n            The court then said:\n\n                   The record is plagued with instances of\n            non-compliance   by   plaintiffs   and   their\n            attorney with discovery deadlines and Court's\n            Orders. For the most part, the Court has been\n            tolerant, although it did previously sanction\n            plaintiffs' attorney in the amount of $600.00\n            for his untimely submission of answers to\n\n\nwrongdoing directed against her.\n\n                                         -7-\n\f            interrogatories.    The Court had observed\n            before that plaintiffs had evidenced a\n            \"continuing pattern of delays.\"      It only\n            appears to have progressed for the worse.\n\n                   These latest incidents reported by\n            movants in their motions only serve to\n            demonstrate plaintiffs' contumacious disregard\n            for the discovery schedule and deadlines\n            established by the Court. They have seriously\n            hampered defendants' preparation for trial,\n            and in so doing have disrupted the orderly\n            progress of this case toward its resolution.\n            Clearly, they merit the imposition of the\n            harshest of sanctions: dismissal.\n\n            On August 28, 2002, Arroyo's counsel filed a motion to\n\nalter or amend the judgment.     Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e).       He said that\n\nthe reason the most recent motions to dismiss and compel had not\n\nbeen answered was that they had been sent to his former address and\n\nnot to a new one identified by him in May 2001 in an informative\n\nmotion.    Counsel also offered explanations for the rescheduling of\n\nthe depositions and said that he had already given the defense in\n\nMarch 2002 all of the Johns Hopkins documents he could obtain.\n\n            The defendants filed an opposition to the Rule 59 motion,\n\narguing on the basis of circumstantial evidence that Arroyo's\n\ncounsel had likely received the motions at his old address.             The\n\noppositions also quarreled in detail with counsel's ameliorating\n\nexplanations for the deposition delays.          The defense also asserted\n\nthat the    Johns   Hopkins   documents   were    still   incomplete.    On\n\nNovember 18, 2002, the district court denied the motion without\n\nopinion, making no findings on any of the disputed points (e.g.,\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fwhether      counsel        had    received      the   motions),      and     this    appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n              The cases commonly say that a dismissal for failure to\n\ncomply with scheduling orders is tested on appeal under an abuse of\n\ndiscretion       standard.

Yet there\n\nappears to be no dispute that Arroyo's counsel had moved his office\n\n\n                                               -9-\n\fand had provided notice, and that, according to their respective\n\ncertificates of service, the motions in question were mailed to the\n\nwrong address.   In the Rule 59 motion, Arroyo's counsel flatly\n\ndenied receiving them; the defendants in response offered some\n\ninference evidence to the contrary,5 but no explicit findings were\n\nmade by the district court.\n\n          If counsel did receive the papers and failed to answer,\n\nthis last straw after a history of delays would be fatal.   Yet on\n\nthis record we cannot ourselves conclude that he did receive the\n\ndocuments and we are unwilling to impute such a finding to the\n\ndistrict judge based on her summary denial of Arroyo's Rule 59\n\nmotion; sometimes an implicit finding is obviously intended or\n\ninferable but in this case it would have been hard to resolve the\n\ndispute without an evidentiary hearing.   Yet, it is not clear that\n\nthe counsel's failure to respond to the defendants' motions was\n\nintended by the judge as a specific reason for the dismissal.\n\n          Based on the dismissal order, the district judge may have\n\nbeen principally concerned with the failures as to deposition\n\n\n     5\n      Defendants claim that at least some of the correspondence\nthat they sent to the wrong address was received by plaintiffs'\ncounsel, as evidenced by a deposition notice that they sent to\ncounsel's old address on May 22, 2002, and which counsel\nsubsequently forwarded on to Dr. Talamini on May 29, 2002.\nDefendants also claim that none of the motions were returned to\nthem as undeliverable. In addition, counsel for defendant Martinez\nfiled an affidavit from his secretary, in which the secretary says\nthat the August 2002 motion to request an extension of time for\nnotifying expert witnesses was in fact sent to the correct address\ndespite the wrong address appearing on the certificate of service.\n\n                               -10-\n\fscheduling and document production that her dismissal order had\n\nidentified.   And, conceivably, the judge found the explanations\n\ngiven by Arroyo's counsel in the Rule 59 motion to be inadequate to\n\nexcuse these scheduling and production gaffes and, against the\n\nbackground of prior delays, found this enough to justify the\n\ndismissal--whether or not counsel's failure to answer the motions\n\nwas excusable.\n\n           If all of the district court's expressed concerns as to\n\nscheduling and production were borne out by supportable findings or\n\neven by record evidence identified by the defendants, we would\n\naffirm.   Given the record of delays by plaintiffs' counsel and the\n\ncourt's clear warning on February 14, 2002, three post-warning\n\ndefaults would be enough to justify the dismissal, severe though\n\nthe sanction would be.    But, once again, the situation is more\n\ncomplicated than appears on the surface.\n\n           The weakest of the charges–-at least on this record--is\n\nthat Arroyo's counsel violated the court's scheduling order by\n\nfailing to produce Dr. Talamini for deposition on June 27, 2002.\n\nThe court's dismissal order said that at the February 14, 2002,\n\nconference, \"[p]laintiffs were [] ordered to arrange for the\n\ndepositions of two of their experts [Drs. Talamini and Brunet] on\n\nMay 14, 2002 and June 27, 2002, respectively.\"   On appeal, Arroyo\n\nobjects that there was no formal order to this effect; rather,\n\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\falong with other formal orders, the \"minutes of proceedings\" simply\n\nlist the depositions and dates.\n\n          With or without a formal order, the minutes reflect the\n\nschedule as an understanding of the court and the parties; thus, an\n\nunjustified   failure   to   carry   through   could   reasonably   be\n\nsanctioned.   The difficulty is that Dr. Talamini was not an expert\n\nwitness biddable by plaintiffs' counsel but, at least by 2002,\n\nmerely a fact witness designated by Arroyo.      Ordinarily, it would\n\nbe defense counsels' job to subpoena such a witness for deposition.\n\nHere, defendants seem to be arguing that Arroyo's counsel had\n\nrepresented to them that he could produce Dr. Talamini on the\n\nspecified date and then failed to carry through.\n\n          In his Rule 59 motion, Arroyo's counsel explained (and\n\nthe record confirms) that he had had great difficulty in getting\n\nthe doctor to cooperate.     However, whether Arroyo's counsel made\n\ncommitments or representations that he should not have made and\n\ncould not keep is much less clear.     Without that, defendants do not\n\nget very far by blaming Arroyo's counsel for failure to move\n\npromptly after the February conference to nail down Dr. Talamini's\n\nagreement to appear.    There are no findings by the district court\n\non this issue.\n\n          As to Dr. Brunet, he was an expert witness for Arroyo, so\n\nArroyo's counsel had a responsibility to produce him for the\n\nscheduled deposition listed in the court's order, cf. Barrett v.\n\n\n                                -12-\n\fAtl. Richfield Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"10308\"><a href=\"/opinion/10308/barrett-v-atlantic-richfield/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">375</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 380-81 (5th Cir. 1996), but it is\n\ncommon ground that the doctor failed to appear because he had to\n\nundertake an emergency surgery on the deposition date–-obviously\n\nsomething over which counsel had no control. The defense says that\n\nthe deposition should have been rescheduled more quickly (it\n\nfinally occurred on August 1, 2002) but it is hard to tell without\n\nfindings how far the re-scheduling delay was counsel's fault and\n\nhow far due to the doctor's own commitments.\n\n          The Johns Hopkins records are a different story.   Here,\n\nit is undisputed that Arroyo's counsel undertook to produce them,\n\nwas ordered finally to do so by the court within 30 days of\n\nFebruary 14, 2002, under threat of sanction, and never managed to\n\nproduce the complete set.6   So far as we can tell, counsel never\n\nshould have subjected himself to such a commitment; Arroyo did not\n\ncontrol the records directly and it would probably have been enough\n\nfor her counsel to provide a written release from her and leave it\n\nto the defense to depose Johns Hopkins and secure the records from\n\nit.\n\n          This is only partial mitigation.   Arroyo's counsel could\n\nnot promise to secure the records, fail to protest about the\n\n\n      6\n      Indeed, it appears that he had earlier been directed by court\norder of July 17, 2001, to produce the records within thirty days.\nBetween July 17, 2001, and February 14, 2002, plaintiffs' counsel\napparently failed to produce any additional documents. On March\n13, 2002, he produced some, but not all of the missing records, but\nthe extent of the remaining deficiency has never been addressed by\nthe district court.\n\n                               -13-\n\fobligation or time limits, and then excuse the failure to comply by\n\nsaying he had done his best.    Nor is it an answer that, after the\n\ndismissal, Arroyo's counsel said that his client had a year earlier\n\nprovided the defense with a general release granting access to her\n\nhospital   records.    Still,   there   is   no   finding   that   Arroyo\n\nultimately failed to produce any documents that he reasonably could\n\nhave or even that there presently exist any documents that Arroyo\n\nhas failed to produce.\n\n           Finally, the district court relied upon a background of\n\nprior delinquencies: \"[t]he record is plagued with instances of\n\nnon-compliance by plaintiffs and their attorney with discovery\n\ndeadlines and Court's Orders.\"      On appeal, Arroyo's appellate\n\ncounsel makes little attempt to challenge this characterization\n\nbeyond saying that the district court did not seriously sanction\n\nearlier defaults.     Given that there were earlier defaults as to\n\ndeadlines, this cuts more against Arroyo's position than in favor.\n\n           Our own unaided review of the record suggests that\n\nArroyo's counsel was regularly in default on small items;7 and, on\n\n\n\n     7\n      For example, Arroyo's counsel was late in filing a response\nto defendants' motion that plaintiffs be required to post a non-\nresident bond, and when the court finally did order the plaintiffs\nto post a bond, plaintiffs posted it late. Counsel also failed to\nanswer defendants' May 18, 2001, motion that the district court\nreconsider its decision on one of their previous motions to\ndismiss--this failure to respond prompted the district court to\norder the plaintiffs to show cause why the case should not be\ndismissed for lack of prosecution--plaintiffs finally filed their\nresponse on June 25, 2001. See also note 6 above.\n\n                                -14-\n\fone    occasion,       he    failed   to   appear    for      a    scheduled      pretrial\n\nconference, saying that his calendar was faulty.                        Further, counsel\n\nwas guilty of failures to meet discovery deadlines, seek necessary\n\nextensions, or even respond in timely fashion to defendants'\n\nfilings.\n\n            Ordinarily, we would affirm the dismissal where, as in\n\nthis    case,    the    plaintiff's        counsel   had      a    history     of    missed\n\ndeadlines and delays, was given a clear last chance warning and\n\ndefaulted again–-here by the failure to produce all of the Johns\n\nHopkins records.            This is so even though Arroyo may well have a\n\nserious medical malpractice claim, prejudice to the defendants from\n\nthe delay is unspecific, and the two doctors in question have now\n\nbeen deposed.      Trial courts cannot manage their heavy case loads\n\nunless appeals courts back them up against an attorney's disregard\n\nof deadlines.\n\n            But    in       this   instance      three   of       the   charges     against\n\nplaintiffs' counsel (failure to answer the motions and the two\n\ndelayed depositions) are simply insupportable without fact findings\n\nthat have       never       been   made;   the    fourth   charge        (Johns     Hopkins\n\nrecords) is borne out but involves partial compliance (perhaps as\n\nmuch as was possible).                What remains is only the charge that\n\nArroyo's counsel regularly missed deadlines, but it is not clear\n\nthat much that occurred after February 14, 2002, made the situation\n\nworse.\n\n\n                                           -15-\n\f           Despite the denial of the Rule 59 motion, we are far from\n\nclear that the district court would have exercised its discretion\n\nto dismiss if–-as may be the case-–(1) Arroyo's counsel never\n\nreceived the motions because defense counsel sent them to the wrong\n\naddress, (2) the court concluded that Arroyo's counsel was not at\n\nfault as to the deposition delays, and (3) the extent of counsel's\n\nefforts to secure the missing Johns Hopkins records were known.\n\n           Accordingly, because the dismissal rests on at least\n\nthree unsupported premises and some uncertainty attends the fourth,\n\nwe think it prudent to remand for further consideration.            Without\n\nlimiting the scope of the district court's authority, we note\n\nseveral options that are available.            The most obvious, if the\n\ndistrict   court   is   so   disposed,    is   to   determine   whether   the\n\nplaintiffs' counsel did receive the defense motions and failed to\n\nanswer, or was significantly at fault as to the scheduling of\n\ndepositions.   An affirmative supportable answer as to either would\n\nin our view adequately support the dismissal.\n\n           Alternatively, the district court is free to conclude\n\nthat these excavations into past history are more trouble than they\n\nare worth and to lay down strict conditions for the future conduct\n\nof the case.   These could include limitations on plaintiffs' proof\n\nor recovery if past delays have provably handicapped the defense;\n\nample latitude for the defense to complete their own discovery and\n\n\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\fpreparations; and a very tight rein on whichever counsel ends up\n\nrepresenting the plaintiffs in the district court.\n\n          Neither side has covered itself in glory in this case.\n\nIf the district judge does end up dismissing the claim, as she may,\n\nArroyo is well warranted in converting her medical malpractice\n\nclaim into one for possible legal malpractice. As for the defense,\n\nit has admittedly been abused by the toleration of past delays by\n\nArroyo's counsel; but if defense counsel had sent the motions to\n\nthe right address and so indicated on their certificates, the\n\npresent uncertainty would likely have been sorted out by now and\n\ngreatly simplified this appeal.\n\n          The   judgment   of   dismissal   as   to   Hospital   Hermanos\n\nMeléndez, Inc., Dr. Juan Martinez-Rodriguez, and Dr. Jesús Seda-\n\nRamírez is vacated and remanded for further proceedings consistent\n\nwith this opinion. This vacation does not reflect the dismissal of\n\nthe claims against Dr. Olga Rodríguez-Rivera, from which plaintiffs\n\nhave not appealed.    Each side shall bear its own costs on this\n\nappeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\f</pre>",
