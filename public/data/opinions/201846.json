BRADLEY and KATHLEEN MARY O'DELL,\n\n                        Defendants, Appellants.\n\n\n             APPEALS FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                   FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n            [Hon. Joseph A. DiClerico, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                          Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                       Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                      and Saris,* District Judge.\n\n\n     William E. Christie with whom Shaheen & Gordon, P.A. was on\nconsolidated brief for appellants.\n     Bradley J. Schlozman, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, with\nwhom Thomas P. Colantuono, United States Attorney, Jessica Dunsay\nSilver and Karl N. Gellert, Department of Justice, Civil Rights\nDivision, Appellate Section, were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n                           October 14, 2005\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation.\n\f            Per Curiam.   In this case the defendants were convicted\n\nof forced labor and related crimes based on their abusive treatment\n\nof several Jamaican seasonal workers whom they recruited in Jamaica\n\nand then kept in the United States by threats and other means.                  The\n\nfacts are recounted in our decision upholding the defendants'\n\nconvictions and sentences.       United States v. Bradley, 390 F.3d 145\n\n(1st Cir. 2004).     Each defendant was sentenced to a prison term of\n\n70 months--the minimum provided for under the governing provisions\n\nof the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\n            After our decision and within the period for seeking\n\ncertiorari, the Supreme Court rendered the Booker decision, United\n\nStates v. Booker, --- U.S. ---, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005), and\n\nthereafter remanded this case to us for reconsideration in light of\n\nBooker.     The    defendants   did    not     preserve   an    attack   on    the\n\nguidelines in the district court.            Thus, under our precedents, the\n\nquestion whether we should now remand for resentencing under the\n\npost-Booker   advisory    guideline      regime    depends      on   whether    the\n\ndefendants can establish a likelihood that in the event of a\n\nremand, their new sentences might well be less than the sentences\n\nimposed on them under the mandatory guidelines.              See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Heldeman, 402 F.3d 220, 224 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            The fact that each defendant was given the minimum\n\nguideline sentence helps their claim--a sentence above the minimum\n\nbeing   a   good   indicator    that    the     trial   judge    did   not     feel\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fconstrained--but is alone insufficient to establish the likelihood\n\nof a different sentence.      United States v. Kornegay, 410 F.3d 89,\n\n100 (1st Cir. 2005).        The district judge in this case made no\n\ncomments at sentencing to cast any light on whether he would have\n\nbeen inclined to give a lower sentence absent the then-mandatory\n\nguidelines or whether he thought the guideline sentence was just\n\nright.     Compare United States v. Cacho-Bonilla, 404 F.3d 84, 95\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).     Nor is this a case in which the circumstances of\n\nthe offenses or defendants strongly suggest one way or the other\n\nthat a judge constructing a \"reasonable\" sentence under the new\n\nadvisory regime would stand by the 70-month sentence.\n\n            The core of the defendants' argument for a remand is that\n\na number of mitigating factors are arguably present, such as prior\n\ngood   works   by   both   defendants,      lesser   wrongdoing   by   O'Dell,\n\ncommunity support for both, indications of no future danger, and--\n\nin both cases but especially O'Dell's--childhood circumstances that\n\nevoke sympathy.     The defendants also make other kinds of arguments\n\nfor    a   remand--for     example,    suggesting      weaknesses      in   the\n\ngovernment's proof of the crimes--but the government's very able\n\nbrief in opposition to the remand thoroughly disposes of such\n\nclaims as unfounded, irrelevant, or both.\n\n            The question, therefore, is whether there is a reasonable\n\nlikelihood that the mitigating circumstances might well induce the\n\ndistrict court, if unshackeled by mandatory guidelines, to give a\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fsomewhat lower sentence to either or both of the defendants.                  The\n\ngovernment stresses, as we have ourselves in other cases, that\n\nmany,    and    perhaps     all,   of   the    mitigating    circumstances   were\n\npresented to the district court, without eliciting any comment from\n\nthe court.       See, e.g., United States v. Figuereo, 404 F.3d 537,\n\n541-42 (1st Cir. 2005).            This may often be a persuasive argument\n\nagainst a remand but it cannot be so in every set of facts.                  Under\n\nmandatory guidelines, a district judge could well conclude that a\n\ngroup of discouraged factors did not quite justify a departure from\n\nthe guidelines under the prevailing \"heartland\" analysis but might\n\njustify    a     somewhat    shorter     sentence    under    a   reasonableness\n\nstandard.\n\n               This case is a very close one but, on balance, we think\n\nthere is enough of a possibility of a different result that we have\n\nconcluded that a remand is appropriate.              Cases like this one turn\n\nalmost entirely on their particular facts and there is no reason to\n\ndescribe in detail the circumstances on which the defendants rely,\n\nespecially as we do not know some of the details and do not have a\n\ndeveloped factual rebuttal such as the government might seek to\n\noffer.    It is enough that we think that the district judge in the\n\ncircumstances of this case deserves an opportunity to consider the\n\nmatter himself.\n\n               The defendants' sentences are vacated and the matter is\n\nremanded to the district court for further sentencing.\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                    -5-\n\f",
