Howard, Attorney  General, and Amy Vorenberg, Assistant\n                                                       \nAttorney General, on brief for appellees.\n\n                                         \n\n                         May 26, 1993\n                                         \n\n          Per Curiam.   After a jury trial in a New Hampshire\n                    \n\nsuperior court,  Robert Hurlburt  was  convicted of  being  a\n\nfelon  in possession of a firearm  in violation of state law,\n\nand sentenced to an extended term of 7 1/2 to 15 years by the\n\ntrial judge (Nadeau,  J.).  The  New Hampshire Supreme  Court\n\nreversed his  conviction because of an  erroneous evidentiary\n\nruling.  See State  v. Hurlburt, 132 N.H. 674, 569 A.2d 1306,\n                               \n\n1306-07  (1990).   A jury  trial was  had before  a different\n\nstate court  judge (Temple,  J.).   The jury  again convicted\n\nHurlburt, but this time Judge Temple imposed an extended term\n\nof 10 to 30 years.  The New Hampshire Supreme Court affirmed.\n\nSee State  v. Hurlburt, 135  N.H. 143,  603 A.2d 493  (1991),\n                      \n\ncert.  denied,  112  S.  Ct.  1770  (1992).    Hurlburt  then\n             \n\npetitioned  for a  writ of  habeas corpus  under 28  U.S.C.  \n\n2254, which was denied.  Hurlburt v. Cunningham, 802 F. Supp.\n                                               \n\n585 (D.N.H. 1992).  We affirm. \n\n          We need  discuss here only one of  the issues which\n\nHurlburt  raises  in  his  appeal.1     He  claims  that  his\n\n                    \n\n1.  The  remaining  claims are  meritless.    First, Hurlburt\nargues that  he did not  voluntarily and knowingly  waive his\nMiranda rights during a post-arrest interview.  He bases this\n       \nclaim  primarily on an error in the transcript from his first\ntrial.  This matter was fully explored and correctly resolved\nat a suppression hearing before his second trial.  Second, he\nclaims  that his  failure  to challenge  the state's  alleged\nfailure  to  prove  that   he  had  been  incarcerated  twice\npreviously on sentences of one year  or more so as to subject\nhim to enhanced sentencing under state  law should be excused\nbecause of ineffective assistance of counsel.  The sentencing\ntranscript  shows that  Hurlburt  himself made  this  precise\nargument  to the court at  sentencing, and so  his failure to\n\n                             -2-\n\nincreased  sentence  after retrial  is  unlawful  under North\n                                                             \n\nCarolina  v. Pearce,  395 U.S.  711 (1969).   In  Pearce, the\n                                                        \n\nSupreme Court found that imposing an increased sentence after\n\nretrial on a defendant who had successfully appealed a  first\n\nconviction would violate  due process of law  if the increase\n\nwere motivated by vindictiveness.  It stated:\n\n          Due   process   of   law,   then,   requires   that\n          vindictiveness  against  a  defendant   for  having\n          successfully  attacked  his  first conviction  must\n          play no part  in the sentence  he receives after  a\n          new trial. . . . In order to  assure the absence of\n          such a motivation, we  have concluded that whenever\n          a  judge  imposes a  more  severe  sentence upon  a\n          defendant after  a new  trial, the reasons  for his\n          doing  so must affirmatively appear.  Those reasons\n          must be based upon objective information concerning\n          identifiable conduct on the  part of the  defendant\n          occurring after the time of the original sentencing\n          proceeding.   And the  factual data upon  which the\n          increased sentence  is based  must be made  part of\n          the  record, so that  the constitutional legitimacy\n          of the increased sentence  may be fully reviewed on\n          appeal.\n\nId.  at   725-26.     Essentially,   Pearce   established   a\n                                           \n\n\"presumption of vindictiveness, which may be overcome only by\n\nobjective  information in the record justifying the increased\n\nsentence.\"    United States  v.  Goodwin, 457  U.S.  368, 374\n                                        \n\n(1982).    \n\n                    \n\nraise it in his direct appeal, at which he submitted a pro se\n                                                             \nbrief supplementing that of  his appointed counsel, must have\nbeen intentional and is  thus not attributable to ineffective\nassistance of counsel.  Third, he  suggests that he exhausted\nhis  state remedies on the issue whether the audiotape of the\nfirst trial should  have been enhanced, but the  record shows\nthat he failed to raise this issue in his direct appeal.\n\n                             -3-\n\n          The   district  court   found   that   the   Pearce\n                                                             \n\npresumption applied even though a different judge had imposed\n\nthe increased sentence.2   But it concluded  that the judge's\n\nstatement of reasons was sufficient to rebut the presumption.\n\n802  F. Supp.  at 594.   Although  the state appears  to have\n\nargued below that the presumption should not apply, on appeal\n\n                    \n\n2.  Although  Pearce involved  a  case in  which a  different\n                    \njudge imposed the harsher sentence after retrial, the Supreme\nCourt has  indicated that Pearce itself is  to be interpreted\n                                \nas establishing a presumption of vindictiveness only in cases\ninvolving a single  sentencer.  See Texas  v. McCullough, 475\n                                                        \nU.S.  134,  140  n.3 (1986).    Our  research indicates  that\ndecisions by  the circuit courts of  appeals after McCullough\n                                                             \nhave  uniformly held  that  the Pearce  presumption does  not\n                                      \napply to the two-sentencer situation.  See Rock v. Zimmerman,\n                                                            \n959  F.2d 1237  (3d  Cir.), cert.  denied,  112 S.  Ct.  3036\n                                         \n(1992); United States v. Perez, 904 F.2d 142 (2d Cir.), cert.\n                                                             \ndenied, 498 U.S.  905 (1990),  and cert. denied,  111 S.  Ct.\n                                               \n1085 (1991);  Gauntlett v.  Kelley, 849  F.2d  213 (6th  Cir.\n                                  \n1988).  Some earlier  cases, however, applied the presumption\nwhere a different judge had imposed the more severe sentence.\nSee, e.g., United States  v. Whitley, 734 F.2d 994  (4th Cir.\n                                    \n1984),  cert. denied, 474  U.S. 873 (1985);  United States v.\n                                                          \nFloyd, 519 F.2d  1031 (5th  Cir. 1975); but  see Holloway  v.\n                                                         \nLockhart, 754 F.2d 252 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 836\n                                               \n(1985).  In Mele v. Fitchburg District Court, 884 F.2d 5 (1st\n                                            \nCir. 1989),  this court held that the  Pearce presumption did\n                                             \nnot  apply where a judge imposed a more severe sentence after\na jury trial than had been imposed by a different judge after\na bench trial.  We held that the bench trial  in the two-tier\nMassachusetts system was analogous to a guilty plea, so that,\nunder  Alabama v. Smith, 490 U.S. 794 (1989), the presumption\n                       \ndid not apply.   We  also commented  that \"in  this case  two\ndifferent   judges  imposed   sentence,  showing   even  less\nlikelihood of  possible vindictiveness  than in  Smith, where\n                                                      \nthe same judge, after being  found to be in error  on appeal,\nwas  responsible for resentencing.\"  Id. at 10.  We expressly\n                                        \nstated, however, that  we were not deciding  that \"whenever a\n                                                           \nsecond judge  is  responsible for  resentencing there  should\narise no  presumption of vindictiveness.   We are  relying on\nthis  factor in light of the particular circumstances of this\ncase.\"  Id. n.4 (emphasis in original).   \n           \n\n                             -4-\n\nit accepts  the district court's reasoning  as \"legally sound\n\nand well supported\" and urges this court instead to affirm on\n\nthe ground  that the  presumption has  been rebutted.   Under\n\nthese circumstances, and  because we conclude  that objective\n\ninformation  in  the  record  here  would  rebut  any  Pearce\n                                                             \n\npresumption applied, we do not decide whether the presumption\n\nshould  apply whenever  a different  judge imposes  a harsher\n\nsentence after  retrial,  but only  assume  for the  sake  of\n\nargument that it does.  \n\n          In  imposing  a  sentence  of  10 to  30  years  on\n\nHurlburt after his retrial, Judge Temple stated:\n\n          Mr. Hurlburt, in view of  your record that has been\n          presented to me here today and by virtue of the two\n          reports  from  the Department  of  Corrections, and\n          what I observed and listened to during the trial as\n          well, I think  if there  ever was a  case that  the\n          maximum enhanced sentence would apply, this is it.\n\n          Accordingly, the sentence in  this case is that you\n          are sentenced to the New Hampshire State Prison for\n          an extended term pursuant  to Chapter 651:6 for not\n          more than 30 years, nor less than 10 years.\n\nIn its decision, the district court focused on Judge Temple's\n\nreference to  the two presentence reports,  which contained a\n\ncopy of  Hurlburt's conviction for possessing  the implements\n\nof escape.   The conviction had been  obtained after Hurlburt\n\nwas  originally sentenced  by  Judge Nadeau,  but before  his\n\nsentencing by Judge Temple.   Acknowledging that Judge Temple\n\ndid not specifically refer to the intervening conviction, the\n\ndistrict   court  found   nonetheless  that   Judge  Temple's\n\n                             -5-\n\nreference  to  the  reports   met  the  requirement  that  an\n\nincreased  sentence be based  on \"objective  information that\n\naffirmatively appears  of record,\" that there  was \"no reason\n\nto believe  that the  conviction  was not  factored into  the\n\nsentencing  decision,\"   and   that  therefore   the   Pearce\n                                                             \n\npresumption had been  rebutted.   802 F.  Supp. at  595.   In\n\nholding that the presumption  had been rebutted, the district\n\ncourt relied on Wasman v. United States, 468 U.S. 559, 569-70\n                                       \n\n(1984), which had held that a sentencing judge could consider\n\na criminal conviction obtained between an original sentencing\n\nand  a  sentencing after  retrial  in  imposing an  increased\n\nsentence and that such  consideration would \"amply\" rebut any\n\npresumption of vindictiveness.  \n\n          Hurlburt argues that Judge Temple's \"bare allusion\"\n\nto the  presentence reports does not  satisfy the requirement\n\nthat  he affirmatively state his  reasons for imposing a more\n\nsevere  penalty than Judge  Nadeau and that  those reasons be\n\nbased  on  objective   information  concerning   identifiable\n\nconduct by Hurlburt.  Clearly, it  would have been preferable\n\nfor Judge Temple to have mentioned the intervening conviction\n\nexplicitly  if he had relied on it to justify the sentence he\n\nimposed,  especially  if  it  were   the  sole  justification\n\nproffered  for the  increased  sentence.   Here, however,  we\n\nbelieve that  his  lack  of  precision does  not  render  his\n\nstatement of reasons inadequate under Pearce.  At the outset,\n                                            \n\n                             -6-\n\nwe note that, unlike Pearce, this is not a case  in which the\n                           \n\nstate has offered no reasons at all for imposing an increased\n\nsentence.   See Wasman, 468  U.S. at 565  (the presumption of\n                      \n\nvindictiveness was unrebutted in Pearce because the state had\n                                       \n\noffered no reason at all  to explain the increased sentence).\n\nJudge Temple  did give reasons  for imposing the  sentence he\n\ndid.    Moreover, since  Judge  Temple was  not  the original\n\nsentencer, he cannot be  expected to have explained precisely\n\nwhy  the sentence he imposed was greater than the one imposed\n\nby Judge Nadeau -- to do so, he would have to have been privy\n\nto  Judge Nadeau's thoughts at the time he imposed the lesser\n\nsentence.3   Finally,  we  think that  focusing  only on  the\n\n                    \n\n3.  Our point is illustrated  by reference to the explanation\ngiven for an increased sentence by the trial judge in Wasman.\n                                                            \nThere,  one  judge  had  imposed both  of  the  sentences  in\nquestion, and had explained his decision  to impose a harsher\nsentence  after  retrial  as  follows:    \"[W]hen  I  imposed\nsentence   the   first   time,   the   only   conviction   on\n[petitioner's] record in this Court's eyes, . . . was failure\nto file income tax returns, nothing else.  I did not consider\nthen and  I  don't in  other  cases either,  pending  matters\nbecause that would result  in a pyramiding of sentences.   At\nthis time, he  comes before  me with two  convictions.\"   468\nU.S. at  562.  Since there  is nothing in the  record to show\nthat  Judge  Temple could  have  known  what motivated  Judge\nNadeau  to impose the sentence  he did, it  is unrealistic to\nexpect him to  compare his and Judge Nadeau's  motivations as\nprecisely  as did  the  judge in  Wasman  to explain  why  he\n                                        \nimposed  a  lengthier  sentence   than  Judge  Nadeau.    The\ndifficulty  which,  we  imagine,  a  second  sentencer  would\ninvariably have in explaining  his motivation relative to the\nmotivation of the original  sentencer suggests one reason why\nthe Pearce presumption may ultimately be confined to the one-\n          \nsentencer  situation.  The root  of this problem  in the two-\nsentencer  context is,  of  course, the  assumption that  the\nsecond,  harsher sentence  represents  an \"increase\"  in  the\nfirst sentence which  must be explained if the presumption is\n\n                             -7-\n\nissue  of  the  intervening   conviction  is  too  narrow  an\n\napproach.   Judge Temple's statement of  reasons was broader.\n\nAltogether, he  gave three reasons for  imposing the sentence\n\nhe did:  (1)  Hurlburt's \"record\" as \"presented to  [him]\" at\n\nthe sentencing hearing; (2)  the two presentence reports; and\n\n(3) \"what I observed and listened to during the trial.\"  \n\n          Our  review of  the  sentencing  transcript,  which\n\namplifies  Judge Temple's  abbreviated statement  of reasons,\n\nconvinces us  that the  district court's conclusion  that the\n\nPearce  presumption has  been rebutted  was correct.   First,\n      \n\nJudge  Temple  stated  that  he relied  on  both  presentence\n\nreports  in  imposing  sentence  on  Hurlburt.    During  the\n\nsentencing hearing, Judge Temple also stated that he had read\n\nboth  of  the  reports.    The  updated  report  contains  an\n\nassessment  of Hurlburt's  prospects  for rehabilitation,  an\n\nissue about which the first report (the only report available\n\nto  Judge Nadeau) is silent.  Based on an interview conducted\n\nafter the second trial,  the updated report recites instances\n\nin which  Hurlburt gave  the probation officer  inaccurate or\n\nmisleading information.   Thus, the updated  report indicated\n\nthat,  even   after  his  second  conviction,   Hurlburt  was\n\n                    \n\nto be rebutted, whereas in reality the differing sentence may\nsimply represent the different sentencing perspective which a\ndifferent  judge  brings  to   bear  on  a  given  sentencing\nsituation.  Compare  Texas v. McCullough,  475 U.S. 134,  140\n                                        \n(1986)  (where   different  sentencers  impose   the  varying\nsentences, a sentence \"increase\" cannot truly be said to have\ntaken place).     \n\n                             -8-\n\ncontinuing  the pattern  of deceptive  behavior noted  in the\n\nfirst report prepared after his first conviction.  (The first\n\nreport had  concluded that Hurlburt  was a \"con-man  only too\n\nwilling  to deceive  others  through  lying  and his  use  of\n\naliases . .  . .\")  The second report concludes that Hurlburt\n\nhas \"no redeeming qualities  that would make him an  asset to\n\nremain   in   the   community,\"  that   his   prospects   for\n\nrehabilitation  were  \"dismal,\"  and  that   Hurlburt  should\n\nparticipate  in  \"intense  psychological   counseling\"  while\n\nincarcerated.  As the  Supreme Court has made  clear, conduct\n\nwhich  sheds  light on  a  defendant's  \"moral character  and\n\nsuitability  for rehabilitation\"  may  be used  to rebut  the\n\nPearce presumption.  See Alabama v. Smith, 490 U.S. 794, 801-\n                                         \n\n02 (1989).  \n\n          Furthermore,  the  presentence  reports do  contain\n\ninformation  about Hurlburt's  conviction for  possessing the\n\nimplements  of  escape which  was  obtained  after his  first\n\nsentencing.   The  first report  makes specific  reference to\n\nHurlburt's pending indictment on  that charge, and a  copy of\n\nhis ensuing conviction  is attached  to the report.   At  the\n\nsentencing hearing, Judge Temple not  only stated that he had\n\nread the reports,  but he also  evidenced his awareness  that\n\nHurlburt's convictions  were  attached to  the first  report,\n\nsuggesting that he had  in fact reviewed them.   In addition,\n\nthe   implements-of-escape    conviction   was   specifically\n\n                             -9-\n\nmentioned  when  the question  of  crediting  the time  which\n\nHurlburt had already  served arose at sentencing.   The state\n\nexplained  that Hurlburt  had  received credit  at his  first\n\nsentencing for the  post-arrest time he  had served, that  it\n\nassumed that he  would be entitled to  credit for all  of the\n\ntime served on  \"this charge\",  and that it  did not  believe\n\nthat any time served for \"[t]he other charge for which he was\n\nconvicted  following this, and on which was imposed a one and\n\na half to three years  consecutive [sentence] . . . has  been\n\ncredited . . .  [b]ut it should only be  credited towards one\n\nof  the offenses.\"4   In response, Judge  Temple evidenced no\n\nconfusion as to which \"other\" conviction the state meant, but\n\nasked only whether  the exact  days to be  credited had  been\n\ncalculated.  After Hurlburt's counsel  gave the figure of 830\n\ndays, Judge Temple took a brief recess.  When he returned, he\n\nannounced  his  reasons  for  imposing  the maximum  possible\n\nsentence, which are quoted above, and immediately  thereafter\n\nstated  that Hurlburt  would be allowed  pretrial confinement\n\ncredit  of  830 days.    We conclude,  therefore,  that Judge\n\nTemple, having  read the presentence reports  and having been\n\nreminded of the intervening  conviction immediately before he\n\n                    \n\n4.  Since  the only intervening  conviction evidenced  by the\nrecord for  which a 1 1/2 to  3 year consecutive sentence was\nimposed was Hurlburt's  implements-of-escape conviction,  the\nstate could only have been referring to that conviction.  \n\n                             -10-\n\nimposed sentence, could well  have taken that conviction into\n\naccount in imposing the sentence he did.  \n\n          In  any event,  Judge  Temple made  clear that  the\n\nsentence  he imposed was also  based on the  \"record that has\n\nbeen presented to me here today . . . and what I observed and\n\nlistened to during the trial as well .  . . .\"  Arguably, the\n\nword \"record\" encompasses more  than just Hurlburt's criminal\n\nrecord,  which  was described  in  detail  at the  sentencing\n\nhearing,  but includes  as  well any  pattern  of conduct  by\n\nHurlburt  which  came  to  Judge  Temple's  attention.5    At\n\nsentencing,  the  state  alluded  to   misrepresentations  by\n\nHurlburt  which  it  had  \"already recounted  to  the  court\"\n\n(presumably at  some other time), and  to Hurlburt's apparent\n\npractice,  in  connection  with  both the  first  and  second\n\ntrials, of making claims which he alleged he could support by\n\naffidavit,  but never did.  The state also reminded the court\n\nof  threatening letters which  Hurlburt had written  to a key\n\nprosecution witness,  as to which there had been testimony at\n\nthe second trial.  It suggested that Hurlburt had lied at the\n\nsentencing hearing itself  when he told Judge Temple  that he\n\nhad not made  the misleading statements attributed  to him in\n\n                    \n\n5.  The criminal record  discussed at the sentencing  hearing\nconsisted of  Hurlburt's pre-1988 record, and  we assume that\nthe same record was presented to Judge Nadeau.  To the extent\nthat  we  need to  inquire into  what  was different  at this\nsentencing  which  would  explain  the   different  sentence,\ntherefore, reliance on that record is not sufficient.  \n\n                             -11-\n\nthe updated presentence  report, arguing that the  statements\n\nin the report could  only have come from Hurlburt  and citing\n\nas corroboration in one  instance statements made by Hurlburt\n\nduring  a deposition  held  before  the  second trial.6    In\n\nconnection  with  its  review   of  the  cited  instances  of\n\ndeceptive  or  obstructive  conduct by  Hurlburt,  the  state\n\nagreed   with   the  probation   officer's   assessment  that\n\n\"everything   points   to   absolutely   no  hope   for   the\n\nrehabilitation  of  this man.   There  is  a need  to protect\n\nsociety  from this person, and the need to punish him for his\n\nconduct  and incarcerate him for  a period of  time that will\n\ngive  full consideration  and  full weight  to his  extensive\n\ncriminal involvement and his  extensive efforts to perpetrate\n\na fraud on this Court at every opportunity.\"  Thus, the state\n\nargued at length  and vigorously  that Hurlburt's  persistent\n\ndeceptive  and obstructive  conduct,  some of  which came  to\n\nlight  in the  presentence reports  and at  trial, had  to be\n\ntaken  into  account in  sentencing.    Given Judge  Temple's\n\nstatement  that  he  had  based Hurlburt's  sentence  on  the\n\npresentence  reports, on the  record presented to  him at the\n\nsentencing  hearing and on what he saw and heard at trial, we\n\n                    \n\n6.  The county attorney representing the state also described\ncertain allegations  which Hurlburt was alleged  to have made\nagainst  her  personally  and against  the  county attorney's\noffice,  but Judge Temple stated that he would not take those\nallegations, which were not otherwise detailed in the record,\ninto consideration in sentencing  Hurlburt.  For that reason,\nthey are also irrelevant to this discussion.\n\n                             -12-\n\nthink it reasonable to  conclude that Judge Temple considered\n\nthat conduct in imposing the sentence he did on Hurlburt.  \n\n          Finally,  we think  it  significant that  the state\n\nobjected   vigorously   to    the   probation    department's\n\nrecommendation  that Hurlburt  be sentenced  to 7  1/2 to  15\n\nyears,  which was the sentence  imposed by Judge  Nadeau.  It\n\nargued that  the probation  officer, who had  recommended the\n\n\"maximum  incarceration  term\", had  not understood  that the\n\nstate enhanced sentencing statute  permitted a term of 10  to\n\n30 years.  The state told Judge Temple that it had asked that\n\nthat   sentence  be  imposed  after  the  first  trial.    It\n\nacknowledged that Judge Nadeau  had only imposed 7 1/2  to 15\n\nyears, but argued for the enhanced sentence because \"that  is\n\nthe sentence  that . . .  should be imposed\" under  the state\n\nenhanced sentencing statute.  When Hurlburt stated that Judge\n\nTemple could only  impose the sentence given by Judge Nadeau,\n\nJudge Temple asked whether Hurlburt wanted \"to be heard as to\n\nwhat the sentence should be[.]\"  Hurlburt's only response was\n\nthat \"I feel that the Court has already made up its mind. . .\n\n.  I would not  even at this juncture  venture to request any\n\ntype of sentence.  I would rely upon the sound discretion and\n\nintelligence  of  the Court.\"    Essentially,  therefore, the\n\nstate argued  that it had  always believed that  imposing the\n\nenhanced sentence would be  the correct sentencing result and\n\nthat Judge Nadeau's sentence had not accounted adequately for\n\n                             -13-\n\nHurlburt's  history  and  character,  and  Hurlburt  made  no\n\ncounterargument.    In  a  somewhat  different   context,  we\n\nindicated that imposing a sentence after successful appeal of\n\na conviction  for the  express purpose of  bringing \"original\n\nsentencing  intentions  to  fruition\" was  permissible.   See\n                                                             \n\nUnited States v.

To the  extent that Judge Temple\n\nmay be inferred to have believed that the state was right and\n\nthat  Judge   Nadeau's  sentence  had  been   too  low,  that\n\nmotivation  would   be  permissible   and  would   provide  a\n\nnonvindictive reason for imposing the increased sentence.\n\n          As this  discussion shows, the  presentence reports\n\nand  the sentencing transcript contain \"objective information\n\nconcerning  identifiable  conduct\"  of Hurlburt's  consistent\n\nwith Judge  Temple's stated  reasons which would  support the\n\nincreased   sentence  Hurlburt  received.    Accordingly,  we\n\nconclude that  Judge Temple's stated reasons  for imposing an\n\nextended term of  10 to 30 years  were \"on-the-record, wholly\n\nlogical,  nonvindictive reason[s]  for  the  sentence\"  which\n\nrebut the  Pearce presumption.

After a jury trial in a New Hampshire\n                    \n\nsuperior court,  Robert Hurlburt  was  convicted of  being  a\n\nfelon  in possession of a firearm  in violation of state law,\n\nand sentenced to an extended term of 7 1/2 to 15 years by the\n\ntrial judge (Nadeau,  J.).

A jury  trial was  had before  a different\n\nstate court  judge (Temple,  J.).   The jury  again convicted\n\nHurlburt, but this time Judge Temple imposed an extended term\n\nof 10 to 30 years.

We affirm. \n\n          We need  discuss here only one of  the issues which\n\nHurlburt  raises  in  his  appeal.1     He  claims  that  his\n\n                    \n\n1.  The  remaining  claims are  meritless.    First, Hurlburt\nargues that  he did not  voluntarily and knowingly  waive his\nMiranda rights during a post-arrest interview.  He bases this\n       \nclaim  primarily on an error in the transcript from his first\ntrial.  This matter was fully explored and correctly resolved\nat a suppression hearing before his second trial.  Second, he\nclaims  that his  failure  to challenge  the state's  alleged\nfailure  to  prove  that   he  had  been  incarcerated  twice\npreviously on sentences of one year  or more so as to subject\nhim to enhanced sentencing under state  law should be excused\nbecause of ineffective assistance of counsel.  The sentencing\ntranscript  shows that  Hurlburt  himself made  this  precise\nargument  to the court at  sentencing, and so  his failure to\n\n                             -2-\n\nincreased  sentence  after retrial  is  unlawful  under North\n                                                             \n\nCarolina  v.

In  Pearce, the\n                                                        \n\nSupreme Court found that imposing an increased sentence after\n\nretrial on a defendant who had successfully appealed a  first\n\nconviction would violate  due process of law  if the increase\n\nwere motivated by vindictiveness.  It stated:\n\n          Due   process   of   law,   then,   requires   that\n          vindictiveness  against  a  defendant   for  having\n          successfully  attacked  his  first conviction  must\n          play no part  in the sentence  he receives after  a\n          new trial. . . . In order to  assure the absence of\n          such a motivation, we  have concluded that whenever\n          a  judge  imposes a  more  severe  sentence upon  a\n          defendant after  a new  trial, the reasons  for his\n          doing  so must affirmatively appear.  Those reasons\n          must be based upon objective information concerning\n          identifiable conduct on the  part of the  defendant\n          occurring after the time of the original sentencing\n          proceeding.   And the  factual data upon  which the\n          increased sentence  is based  must be made  part of\n          the  record, so that  the constitutional legitimacy\n          of the increased sentence  may be fully reviewed on\n          appeal.\n\nId.  at   725-26.

Third, he  suggests that he exhausted\nhis  state remedies on the issue whether the audiotape of the\nfirst trial should  have been enhanced, but the  record shows\nthat he failed to raise this issue in his direct appeal.\n\n                             -3-\n\n          The   district  court   found   that   the   Pearce\n                                                             \n\npresumption applied even though a different judge had imposed\n\nthe increased sentence.2   But it concluded  that the judge's\n\nstatement of reasons was sufficient to rebut the presumption.\n\n802  F.

Although  Pearce involved  a  case in  which a  different\n                    \njudge imposed the harsher sentence after retrial, the Supreme\nCourt has  indicated that Pearce itself is  to be interpreted\n                                \nas establishing a presumption of vindictiveness only in cases\ninvolving a single  sentencer.

Under\n\nthese circumstances, and  because we conclude  that objective\n\ninformation  in  the  record  here  would  rebut  any  Pearce\n                                                             \n\npresumption applied, we do not decide whether the presumption\n\nshould  apply whenever  a different  judge imposes  a harsher\n\nsentence after  retrial,  but only  assume  for the  sake  of\n\nargument that it does.  \n\n          In  imposing  a  sentence  of  10 to  30  years  on\n\nHurlburt after his retrial, Judge Temple stated:\n\n          Mr. Hurlburt, in view of  your record that has been\n          presented to me here today and by virtue of the two\n          reports  from  the Department  of  Corrections, and\n          what I observed and listened to during the trial as\n          well, I think  if there  ever was a  case that  the\n          maximum enhanced sentence would apply, this is it.\n\n          Accordingly, the sentence in  this case is that you\n          are sentenced to the New Hampshire State Prison for\n          an extended term pursuant  to Chapter 651:6 for not\n          more than 30 years, nor less than 10 years.\n\nIn its decision, the district court focused on Judge Temple's\n\nreference to  the two presentence reports,  which contained a\n\ncopy of  Hurlburt's conviction for possessing  the implements\n\nof escape.   The conviction had been  obtained after Hurlburt\n\nwas  originally sentenced  by  Judge Nadeau,  but before  his\n\nsentencing by Judge Temple.   Acknowledging that Judge Temple\n\ndid not specifically refer to the intervening conviction, the\n\ndistrict   court  found   nonetheless  that   Judge  Temple's\n\n                             -5-\n\nreference  to  the  reports   met  the  requirement  that  an\n\nincreased  sentence be based  on \"objective  information that\n\naffirmatively appears  of record,\" that there  was \"no reason\n\nto believe  that the  conviction  was not  factored into  the\n\nsentencing  decision,\"   and   that  therefore   the   Pearce\n                                                             \n\npresumption had been  rebutted.   802 F.  Supp. at  595.   In\n\nholding that the presumption  had been rebutted, the district\n\ncourt relied on Wasman v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111253\"><a href=\"/opinion/111253/wasman-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">559</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 569-70\n                                       \n\n(1984), which had held that a sentencing judge could consider\n\na criminal conviction obtained between an original sentencing\n\nand  a  sentencing after  retrial  in  imposing an  increased\n\nsentence and that such  consideration would \"amply\" rebut any\n\npresumption of vindictiveness.  \n\n          Hurlburt argues that Judge Temple's \"bare allusion\"\n\nto the  presentence reports does not  satisfy the requirement\n\nthat  he affirmatively state his  reasons for imposing a more\n\nsevere  penalty than Judge  Nadeau and that  those reasons be\n\nbased  on  objective   information  concerning   identifiable\n\nconduct by Hurlburt.  Clearly, it  would have been preferable\n\nfor Judge Temple to have mentioned the intervening conviction\n\nexplicitly  if he had relied on it to justify the sentence he\n\nimposed,  especially  if  it  were   the  sole  justification\n\nproffered  for the  increased  sentence.   Here, however,  we\n\nbelieve that  his  lack  of  precision does  not  render  his\n\nstatement of reasons inadequate under Pearce.  At the outset,\n                                            \n\n                             -6-\n\nwe note that, unlike Pearce, this is not a case  in which the\n                           \n\nstate has offered no reasons at all for imposing an increased\n\nsentence.   See Wasman, 468  U.S. at 565  (the presumption of\n                      \n\nvindictiveness was unrebutted in Pearce because the state had\n                                       \n\noffered no reason at all  to explain the increased sentence).\n\nJudge Temple  did give reasons  for imposing the  sentence he\n\ndid.    Moreover, since  Judge  Temple was  not  the original\n\nsentencer, he cannot be  expected to have explained precisely\n\nwhy  the sentence he imposed was greater than the one imposed\n\nby Judge Nadeau -- to do so, he would have to have been privy\n\nto  Judge Nadeau's thoughts at the time he imposed the lesser\n\nsentence.3   Finally,  we  think that  focusing  only on  the\n\n                    \n\n3.  Our point is illustrated  by reference to the explanation\ngiven for an increased sentence by the trial judge in Wasman.\n                                                            \nThere,  one  judge  had  imposed both  of  the  sentences  in\nquestion, and had explained his decision  to impose a harsher\nsentence  after  retrial  as  follows:    \"[W]hen  I  imposed\nsentence   the   first   time,   the   only   conviction   on\n[petitioner's] record in this Court's eyes, . . . was failure\nto file income tax returns, nothing else.  I did not consider\nthen and  I  don't in  other  cases either,  pending  matters\nbecause that would result  in a pyramiding of sentences.   At\nthis time, he  comes before  me with two  convictions.\"   468\nU.S. at  562.  Since there  is nothing in the  record to show\nthat  Judge  Temple could  have  known  what motivated  Judge\nNadeau  to impose the sentence  he did, it  is unrealistic to\nexpect him to  compare his and Judge Nadeau's  motivations as\nprecisely  as did  the  judge in  Wasman  to explain  why  he\n                                        \nimposed  a  lengthier  sentence   than  Judge  Nadeau.    The\ndifficulty  which,  we  imagine,  a  second  sentencer  would\ninvariably have in explaining  his motivation relative to the\nmotivation of the original  sentencer suggests one reason why\nthe Pearce presumption may ultimately be confined to the one-\n          \nsentencer  situation.  The root  of this problem  in the two-\nsentencer  context is,  of  course, the  assumption that  the\nsecond,  harsher sentence  represents  an \"increase\"  in  the\nfirst sentence which  must be explained if the presumption is\n\n                             -7-\n\nissue  of  the  intervening   conviction  is  too  narrow  an\n\napproach.   Judge Temple's statement of  reasons was broader.\n\nAltogether, he  gave three reasons for  imposing the sentence\n\nhe did:  (1)  Hurlburt's \"record\" as \"presented to  [him]\" at\n\nthe sentencing hearing; (2)  the two presentence reports; and\n\n(3) \"what I observed and listened to during the trial.\"  \n\n          Our  review of  the  sentencing  transcript,  which\n\namplifies  Judge Temple's  abbreviated statement  of reasons,\n\nconvinces us  that the  district court's conclusion  that the\n\nPearce  presumption has  been rebutted  was correct.   First,\n      \n\nJudge  Temple  stated  that  he relied  on  both  presentence\n\nreports  in  imposing  sentence  on  Hurlburt.    During  the\n\nsentencing hearing, Judge Temple also stated that he had read\n\nboth  of  the  reports.    The  updated  report  contains  an\n\nassessment  of Hurlburt's  prospects  for rehabilitation,  an\n\nissue about which the first report (the only report available\n\nto  Judge Nadeau) is silent.  Based on an interview conducted\n\nafter the second trial,  the updated report recites instances\n\nin which  Hurlburt gave  the probation officer  inaccurate or\n\nmisleading information.   Thus, the updated  report indicated\n\nthat,  even   after  his  second  conviction,   Hurlburt  was\n\n                    \n\nto be rebutted, whereas in reality the differing sentence may\nsimply represent the different sentencing perspective which a\ndifferent  judge  brings  to   bear  on  a  given  sentencing\nsituation.  Compare  Texas v. McCullough,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111602\"><a href=\"/opinion/111602/texas-v-mccullough/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">134</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  140\n                                        \n(1986)  (where   different  sentencers  impose   the  varying\nsentences, a sentence \"increase\" cannot truly be said to have\ntaken place).     \n\n                             -8-\n\ncontinuing  the pattern  of deceptive  behavior noted  in the\n\nfirst report prepared after his first conviction.  (The first\n\nreport had  concluded that Hurlburt  was a \"con-man  only too\n\nwilling  to deceive  others  through  lying  and his  use  of\n\naliases . .  . .\")  The second report concludes that Hurlburt\n\nhas \"no redeeming qualities  that would make him an  asset to\n\nremain   in   the   community,\"  that   his   prospects   for\n\nrehabilitation  were  \"dismal,\"  and  that   Hurlburt  should\n\nparticipate  in  \"intense  psychological   counseling\"  while\n\nincarcerated.  As the  Supreme Court has made  clear, conduct\n\nwhich  sheds  light on  a  defendant's  \"moral character  and\n\nsuitability  for rehabilitation\"  may  be used  to rebut  the\n\nPearce presumption.  See Alabama v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112276\"><a href=\"/opinion/112276/alabama-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">794</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 801-\n                                         \n\n02 (1989).  \n\n          Furthermore,  the  presentence  reports do  contain\n\ninformation  about Hurlburt's  conviction for  possessing the\n\nimplements  of  escape which  was  obtained  after his  first\n\nsentencing.   The  first report  makes specific  reference to\n\nHurlburt's pending indictment on  that charge, and a  copy of\n\nhis ensuing conviction  is attached  to the report.   At  the\n\nsentencing hearing, Judge Temple not  only stated that he had\n\nread the reports,  but he also  evidenced his awareness  that\n\nHurlburt's convictions  were  attached to  the first  report,\n\nsuggesting that he had  in fact reviewed them.   In addition,\n\nthe   implements-of-escape    conviction   was   specifically\n\n                             -9-\n\nmentioned  when  the question  of  crediting  the time  which\n\nHurlburt had already  served arose at sentencing.   The state\n\nexplained  that Hurlburt  had  received credit  at his  first\n\nsentencing for the  post-arrest time he  had served, that  it\n\nassumed that he  would be entitled to  credit for all  of the\n\ntime served on  \"this charge\",  and that it  did not  believe\n\nthat any time served for \"[t]he other charge for which he was\n\nconvicted  following this, and on which was imposed a one and\n\na half to three years  consecutive [sentence] . . . has  been\n\ncredited . . .  [b]ut it should only be  credited towards one\n\nof  the offenses.\"4   In response, Judge  Temple evidenced no\n\nconfusion as to which \"other\" conviction the state meant, but\n\nasked only whether  the exact  days to be  credited had  been\n\ncalculated.  After Hurlburt's counsel  gave the figure of 830\n\ndays, Judge Temple took a brief recess.  When he returned, he\n\nannounced  his  reasons  for  imposing  the maximum  possible\n\nsentence, which are quoted above, and immediately  thereafter\n\nstated  that Hurlburt  would be allowed  pretrial confinement\n\ncredit  of  830 days.    We conclude,  therefore,  that Judge\n\nTemple, having  read the presentence reports  and having been\n\nreminded of the intervening  conviction immediately before he\n\n                    \n\n4.  Since  the only intervening  conviction evidenced  by the\nrecord for  which a 1 1/2 to  3 year consecutive sentence was\nimposed was Hurlburt's  implements-of-escape conviction,  the\nstate could only have been referring to that conviction.  \n\n                             -10-\n\nimposed sentence, could well  have taken that conviction into\n\naccount in imposing the sentence he did.  \n\n          In  any event,  Judge  Temple made  clear that  the\n\nsentence  he imposed was also  based on the  \"record that has\n\nbeen presented to me here today . . . and what I observed and\n\nlistened to during the trial as well .  . . .\"  Arguably, the\n\nword \"record\" encompasses more  than just Hurlburt's criminal\n\nrecord,  which  was described  in  detail  at the  sentencing\n\nhearing,  but includes  as  well any  pattern  of conduct  by\n\nHurlburt  which  came  to  Judge  Temple's  attention.5    At\n\nsentencing,  the  state  alluded  to   misrepresentations  by\n\nHurlburt  which  it  had  \"already recounted  to  the  court\"\n\n(presumably at  some other time), and  to Hurlburt's apparent\n\npractice,  in  connection  with  both the  first  and  second\n\ntrials, of making claims which he alleged he could support by\n\naffidavit,  but never did.  The state also reminded the court\n\nof  threatening letters which  Hurlburt had written  to a key\n\nprosecution witness,  as to which there had been testimony at\n\nthe second trial.  It suggested that Hurlburt had lied at the\n\nsentencing hearing itself  when he told Judge Temple  that he\n\nhad not made  the misleading statements attributed  to him in\n\n                    \n\n5.  The criminal record  discussed at the sentencing  hearing\nconsisted of  Hurlburt's pre-1988 record, and  we assume that\nthe same record was presented to Judge Nadeau.  To the extent\nthat  we  need to  inquire into  what  was different  at this\nsentencing  which  would  explain  the   different  sentence,\ntherefore, reliance on that record is not sufficient.  \n\n                             -11-\n\nthe updated presentence  report, arguing that the  statements\n\nin the report could  only have come from Hurlburt  and citing\n\nas corroboration in one  instance statements made by Hurlburt\n\nduring  a deposition  held  before  the  second trial.6    In\n\nconnection  with  its  review   of  the  cited  instances  of\n\ndeceptive  or  obstructive  conduct by  Hurlburt,  the  state\n\nagreed   with   the  probation   officer's   assessment  that\n\n\"everything   points   to   absolutely   no  hope   for   the\n\nrehabilitation  of  this man.   There  is  a need  to protect\n\nsociety  from this person, and the need to punish him for his\n\nconduct  and incarcerate him for  a period of  time that will\n\ngive  full consideration  and  full weight  to his  extensive\n\ncriminal involvement and his  extensive efforts to perpetrate\n\na fraud on this Court at every opportunity.\"  Thus, the state\n\nargued at length  and vigorously  that Hurlburt's  persistent\n\ndeceptive  and obstructive  conduct,  some of  which came  to\n\nlight  in the  presentence reports  and at  trial, had  to be\n\ntaken  into  account in  sentencing.    Given Judge  Temple's\n\nstatement  that  he  had  based Hurlburt's  sentence  on  the\n\npresentence  reports, on the  record presented to  him at the\n\nsentencing  hearing and on what he saw and heard at trial, we\n\n                    \n\n6.  The county attorney representing the state also described\ncertain allegations  which Hurlburt was alleged  to have made\nagainst  her  personally  and against  the  county attorney's\noffice,  but Judge Temple stated that he would not take those\nallegations, which were not otherwise detailed in the record,\ninto consideration in sentencing  Hurlburt.  For that reason,\nthey are also irrelevant to this discussion.\n\n                             -12-\n\nthink it reasonable to  conclude that Judge Temple considered\n\nthat conduct in imposing the sentence he did on Hurlburt.  \n\n          Finally,  we think  it  significant that  the state\n\nobjected   vigorously   to    the   probation    department's\n\nrecommendation  that Hurlburt  be sentenced  to 7  1/2 to  15\n\nyears,  which was the sentence  imposed by Judge  Nadeau.  It\n\nargued that  the probation  officer, who had  recommended the\n\n\"maximum  incarceration  term\", had  not understood  that the\n\nstate enhanced sentencing statute  permitted a term of 10  to\n\n30 years.  The state told Judge Temple that it had asked that\n\nthat   sentence  be  imposed  after  the  first  trial.    It\n\nacknowledged that Judge Nadeau  had only imposed 7 1/2  to 15\n\nyears, but argued for the enhanced sentence because \"that  is\n\nthe sentence  that . . .  should be imposed\" under  the state\n\nenhanced sentencing statute.  When Hurlburt stated that Judge\n\nTemple could only  impose the sentence given by Judge Nadeau,\n\nJudge Temple asked whether Hurlburt wanted \"to be heard as to\n\nwhat the sentence should be[.]\"  Hurlburt's only response was\n\nthat \"I feel that the Court has already made up its mind. . .\n\n.  I would not  even at this juncture  venture to request any\n\ntype of sentence.  I would rely upon the sound discretion and\n\nintelligence  of  the Court.\"    Essentially,  therefore, the\n\nstate argued  that it had  always believed that  imposing the\n\nenhanced sentence would be  the correct sentencing result and\n\nthat Judge Nadeau's sentence had not accounted adequately for\n\n                             -13-\n\nHurlburt's  history  and  character,  and  Hurlburt  made  no\n\ncounterargument.    In  a  somewhat  different   context,  we\n\nindicated that imposing a sentence after successful appeal of\n\na conviction  for the  express purpose of  bringing \"original\n\nsentencing  intentions  to  fruition\" was  permissible.

To the  extent that Judge Temple\n\nmay be inferred to have believed that the state was right and\n\nthat  Judge   Nadeau's  sentence  had  been   too  low,  that\n\nmotivation  would   be  permissible   and  would   provide  a\n\nnonvindictive reason for imposing the increased sentence.\n\n          As this  discussion shows, the  presentence reports\n\nand  the sentencing transcript contain \"objective information\n\nconcerning  identifiable  conduct\"  of Hurlburt's  consistent\n\nwith Judge  Temple's stated  reasons which would  support the\n\nincreased   sentence  Hurlburt  received.    Accordingly,  we\n\nconclude that  Judge Temple's stated reasons  for imposing an\n\nextended term of  10 to 30 years  were \"on-the-record, wholly\n\nlogical,  nonvindictive reason[s]  for  the  sentence\"  which\n\nrebut the  Pearce presumption.
