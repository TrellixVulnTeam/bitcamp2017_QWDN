This appeal requires us to explore\n\nthe limits of a trial judge's authority to remove a significant\n\npiece of evidence from a jury's consideration based upon his belief\n\nthat the evidence lacks persuasive force.1         We conclude that, in\n\nthe circumstances of this case, the judge's actions invaded the\n\nprovince of the jury.       Because there is a reasonable likelihood\n\nthat the error influenced the eventual verdict, we vacate the\n\njudgment as to the affected claims and remand the case for a new\n\ntrial.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n            On October 30, 1998, Betty Ann Blake, a profoundly\n\ndisabled woman in her mid-forties, was eating her mid-day meal at\n\na daycare facility.      A piece of meat lodged in her throat.   She was\n\ntaken to the emergency room at Charlton Memorial Hospital (the\n\nHospital)   in    Fall   River,   Massachusetts.   Although   laypersons\n\nspeculated that Betty Ann might be choking, she apparently refused\n\nto open her mouth and the doctors on duty did not conduct a full\n\nexamination.\n\n            Betty Ann was admitted to the Hospital.       The following\n\nday, she had a seizure and began to display labored breathing.       The\n\ndoctors performed an esophagoscopy.         During the procedure, they\n\ndiscovered a bolus of meat in Betty Ann's esophagus and dislodged\n\n\n     1\n      The district court used \"persuasiveness\" and \"credibility\" as\nrough synonyms in connection with this ruling, and we too use those\nterms as proxies for one another.\n\n                                     -2-\n\fit.     Shortly thereafter, Betty Ann suffered a heart attack.                    She\n\ndied on November 1, 1998 (approximately twenty-four hours after\n\nphysicians removed the piece of meat from her esophagus).                         The\n\ndeath     certificate     filed       by     the       medical    examiner     listed\n\n\"complications of asphyxia by choking\" as the cause of death.\n\n              Betty   Ann's     parents,         William    and     Theresa    Blake,\n\nindividually and as co-administrators of her estate, subsequently\n\nsued    the    Hospital   and    a    trio       of    physicians    (Drs.    Michael\n\nPellegrino,      Miguel   Brillantes,            and   Thomas     Cahill).      Their\n\ncomplaint, filed in the federal district court, charged that the\n\ndefendants had negligently failed to diagnose Betty Ann's condition\n\nand had discriminated against her in violation of Title III of the\n\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12181-12189,\n\nand the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 701-796l.                    In the course\n\nof pretrial proceedings, the district court dismissed the ADA claim\n\nand granted summary judgment for the physician-defendants on the\n\nRehabilitation Act claim.            The plaintiffs have not appealed from\n\nthose orders.\n\n              The case went to trial on the remaining counts, which\n\nincluded the Rehabilitation Act claim against the Hospital, see 29\n\nU.S.C. § 794, and state-law claims, grounded in malpractice, for\n\nwrongful death and negligent infliction of emotional distress\n\nagainst the physicians.         At the start of the trial, the physician-\n\ndefendants moved in limine to exclude the death certificate.                     The\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\fcourt ruled that the death certificate constituted admissible\n\nevidence and denied the motion. The plaintiffs promptly introduced\n\nit into evidence and published it to the jury.                      The court then\n\nallowed the jurors to inspect copies of the death certificate.\n\n              On the fifteenth day of trial, the plaintiffs rested.\n\nThe physician-defendants moved, inter alia, to strike the listed\n\ncause    of   death    from     the    death    certificate.        The    plaintiffs\n\nobjected.     On the seventeenth day of trial — before the defendants\n\nhad presented any evidence — the district judge excised the words\n\n\"asphyxia by choking\" from the death certificate, stating that he\n\nhad come to believe that Betty Ann's death was \"not caused by\n\n'complications        of     asphyxia    by     choking'    as   that     phrase    was\n\nunderstood either by a layperson or by physicians.\"2\n\n              The    trial    lasted    another     three   days.         After    final\n\narguments      and    the     court's    charge,     the    jury    commenced       its\n\ndeliberations.        On November 26, 2001, the jury returned a verdict\n\nfor the Hospital on the Rehabilitation Act count but informed the\n\ncourt that it had reached an impasse on the remaining claims.                        The\n\ncourt gave the deadlocked jurors a modified Allen charge, see Allen\n\n\n     2\n      The physician-defendants argued — and the court apparently\ncame to believe — that Betty Ann experienced an aspiration, not\nasphyxia by choking.    By aspiration, the defendants meant \"the\neffects of saliva going down into the lungs . . . which can lead to\ninfection, fluid in the lungs, and then death if left untreated.\"\nBr. of the Physician-Appellees at 23. This was a more likely cause\nof death than asphyxia, they posited, inasmuch as Betty Ann \"did\nnot suffer an obstruction of her airway at any time when she was in\nthe hospital.\" Id.\n\n                                          -4-\n\fv. United States, 164 U.S. 492, 501 (1896); United States v. Keene,\n\n287 F.3d 229, 235 (1st Cir. 2002), and directed them to resume\n\ndeliberations.    On November 27, the jury returned an across-the-\n\nboard verdict for the defendants.\n\n             The plaintiffs filed a timely motion for a new trial.\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 59(a).      As to the state-law claims, they argued\n\nthat   the   district   court   had   erred     in    redacting    the   death\n\ncertificate, and, moreover, that the timing of the court's actions\n\n— allowing them to introduce the unredacted death certificate,\n\npublish it to the jury, and build their case around it, and then\n\nstriking the     pivotal   language   —   had   doomed    their   chances   of\n\nprevailing.     As to the Rehabilitation Act claim, the plaintiffs\n\nsought a new trial based on the district court's exclusion of\n\nmedical records of non-disabled patients. The lower court took the\n\nmatter under advisement.        It eventually denied the motion in a\n\nwritten opinion. See Blake v. Southcoast Health Sys., Inc., 206 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 174 (D. Mass. 2002).      The court insisted that none of its\n\nactions constituted error.       Id. at 182.         With admirable candor,\n\nhowever, the court conceded that if it had erred in the mid-trial\n\nredaction of the death certificate, its error was not harmless\n\n(and, thus, would require a new trial).         Id. at 177.       This appeal\n\nensued.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fII.   THE STATE-LAW CLAIMS\n\n           The issue that lies at the heart of this appeal relates\n\nto the trial court's handling of an evidentiary matter.                When an\n\nissue as to the admission or exclusion of evidence involves a\n\nquestion of law, such as the proper interpretation of a provision\n\ncontained in the Federal Rules of Evidence, we afford de novo\n\nreview.   Crowley v. L.L. Bean, Inc., 303 F.3d 387, 394 (1st Cir.\n\n2002). When, however, the issue involves an application of a given\n\nrule of evidence to particular facts or a judgment call about, say,\n\nrelevancy, we review solely for abuse of discretion.             Id.\n\n           Identifying the precise question at issue in this appeal\n\nposes certain complications.       These complications arise primarily\n\nfrom the parties' disagreement about whether federal or state law\n\ngoverns the admissibility vel non of the death certificate.                 The\n\nplaintiffs argue that state law controls because, by statute in\n\nMassachusetts,   a   party   is   entitled    not   only   to   introduce    an\n\nofficial death certificate but also to have it serve as prima facie\n\nevidence of the cause of death.      Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 46, § 19.          In\n\nthe plaintiffs' view, the Federal Rules of Evidence \"are not\n\nintended to substitute for, or trump, a clear state substantive\n\nright to have certain evidence admitted in a state tort death\n\nclaim.\"   Br. of Appellants at 27.           The defendants argue to the\n\ncontrary, asserting the primacy of the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n\nSee, e.g., Br. of Physician-Appellees at 25 (\"The fact that a state\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fstatute also existed regarding the admissibility of the death\n\ncertificate [does] not trump the force of the Federal Rules of\n\nEvidence.\").   Although this is an interesting pedagogical debate,\n\nwe do not resolve it here.     Assuming arguendo that the Federal\n\nRules of Evidence govern — an assumption consistent with the\n\ndistrict court's position and optimally favorable to the defendants\n\n— the district court's handling of the evidence, as we explain\n\nbelow, does not pass muster.\n\n                          A.   The Error.\n\n          The fundamental question posed in this case implicates\n\nthe division of responsibility between judge and jury.     It asks\n\nwhether a judge, presiding over a jury trial, may rule on the\n\nadmissibility of evidence based upon his view of the persuasiveness\n\nof that evidence.   In other words, may a trial judge refuse to\n\nadmit evidence simply because he does not believe the truth of the\n\nproposition that the evidence asserts?      In the circumstances of\n\nthis case, we answer that question in the negative.3\n\n\n\n     3\n      Of course, there are specific circumstances in which a trial\njudge's view of the credibility of the evidence is an important\nvariable in the calculus of admissibility.       The most obvious\nexample is in a so-called Daubert hearing. See Daubert v. Merrell\nDow Pharm., Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 597 (1993) (explaining that \"the\nRules of Evidence . . . assign to the trial judge the task of\nensuring that an expert's testimony . . . rests on a reliable\nfoundation\"); see also United States v. Sebaggala, 256 F.3d 59, 65-\n66 (1st Cir. 2001) (discussing a trial court's considerable\nlatitude in the admission and exclusion of expert testimony under\nFed. R. Evid. 702). The case at hand does not fit within any of\nthese exceptions.\n\n                                -7-\n\f            The disputed evidence in this case — the cause of death\n\nspecified in the death certificate — was plainly relevant to the\n\nissues before the court.          See Fed. R. Evid. 401.             Even so, a\n\ndistrict court has the authority to exclude relevant evidence for\n\nvarious reasons.          See, e.g., Fed. R. Evid. 403 (allowing the\n\nexclusion of evidence if the court finds that its probative value\n\nis substantially outweighed by its unfairly prejudicial effect, or\n\nthat the evidence would tend to confuse or mislead the jury).                   But\n\nnone of these mechanisms allows a trial judge to remove relevant\n\nevidence from the jury's universe solely because he finds the\n\nevidence unpersuasive.        Perhaps more importantly, the trial judge\n\nin this case did not invoke any of them.         Indeed, the judge made it\n\nvery   clear    that   persuasiveness   (or   the    lack      of   it)   was   the\n\nperceived problem.        See Blake, 206 F. Supp. 2d at 177 (attributing\n\nthe decision to redact to the fact that \"the Court was no longer\n\npersuaded      by   the   fair   preponderance      of   the     evidence       that\n\n'complications of asphyxia by choking' was the primary cause of\n\nBetty Ann Blake's death\"); id. at 176-77 (\"As the trial progressed\n\n. . . it became increasingly evident [to me] that, whatever had\n\ncaused the death of Betty Ann Blake after twenty-seven hours of\n\nsuffering, it was not 'complications of asphyxia by choking.'\").\n\n            The question reduces, therefore, to whether, in the\n\nabsence of special circumstances, see supra note 3, a trial judge\n\nhas the authority to exclude evidence on the basis of his own\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fbelief as to the persuasiveness of that evidence.                        We conclude\n\nthat, in a jury trial, no such authority exists.                    After all, the\n\njury     is   the    factfinder,     and     \"the     ultimate    arbiter    of    the\n\npersuasiveness       of   the     proof   must   be    the    factfinder,   not    the\n\nlawgiver.\"       Greenburg v. P.R. Maritime Shipping Auth., 835 F.2d\n\n932, 937 (1st Cir. 1987).          This premise has gone unchanged over the\n\nyears.    See, e.g., Gallick v. Baltimore & Ohio R.R. Co., 372 U.S.\n\n108, 114-15 (1963); Tennant v. Peoria & Pekin Union Ry. Co., 321\n\nU.S. 29, 35 (1944).         \"It is the jury, not the court, which is the\n\nfact-finding body.           It weighs the contradictory evidence and\n\ninferences, judges the credibility of witnesses . . . and draws the\n\nultimate conclusions as to the facts.\"                       Boston & Me. R.R. v.\n\nCabana, 148 F.2d 150, 152 (1st Cir. 1945) (citing Tennant, 321 U.S.\n\nat 35).\n\n              In arrogating unto itself the power to evaluate the\n\npersuasiveness of the medical examiner's conclusion about the cause\n\nof death, memorialized in the death certificate, the district court\n\nadverted to Fed. R. Evid. 104(a) and Fed. R. Evid. 803(8) as the\n\nwellsprings of its authority.              Neither of these rules adequately\n\nunderpins the court's action.\n\n              Fed. R. Evid. 104(a) provides in pertinent part that\n\n\"[p]reliminary questions concerning . . . the admissibility of\n\nevidence shall be determined by the court.\"                    This rule enables a\n\ntrial    judge      to   decide    whether      foundational     facts    have    been\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\festablished (and, thus, whether particular pieces of evidence are\n\neligible for admission).       See Sacramona v. Bridgestone/Firestone,\n\nInc., 106 F.3d 444, 446 (1st Cir. 1997).          The trial court \"act[s]\n\nas   a   gatekeeper\"   when   such   issues   arise.   United   States   v.\n\nHolmquist, 36 F.3d 154, 167 (1st Cir. 1994).              \"If the court\n\ndiscerns enough support in the record to warrant a reasonable\n\nperson in determining that the evidence [could support that which\n\nit sets out to support, then] the weight to be given to the\n\nevidence is left to the jury.\"        United States v. Paulino, 13 F.3d\n\n20, 23 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n            Rule 104(a) is inapposite here, for no foundational facts\n\nwere in issue.     Virtually by definition, foundational facts are\n\nthose facts upon which the admissibility of evidence rests.              See\n\nUnited States v. Piper, 298 F.3d 47, 52 (1st Cir. 2002); Paulino,\n\n13 F.3d at 23.   Those facts include matters such as the genuineness\n\nof a document or statement, the maker's personal knowledge, and the\n\nlike. See, e.g., Newton v. Ryder Transp. Servs., 206 F.3d 772, 775\n\n(8th Cir. 2000); Ricketts v. City of Hartford, 74 F.3d 1397, 1410\n\n(2d Cir. 1996); Onujiogu v. United States, 817 F.2d 3, 5 (1st Cir.\n\n1987).    In this instance, those facts (e.g., the authenticity of\n\nthe death certificate and the authority of the medical examiner to\n\nsign it) were never in dispute.        The district court's problem did\n\nnot go to any foundational fact, but, rather, to the very core of\n\nthe evidence:     its persuasiveness.         Where, as here, a piece of\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fevidence rests upon a proper foundation, Rule 104(a) does not\n\npermit a trial judge to usurp the jury's function and exclude the\n\nevidence    based    on    the     judge's    determination     that      it   lacks\n\npersuasive force.\n\n            The district court also suggested that Fed. R. Evid.\n\n803(8) empowered it to redact the death certificate based on the\n\nperceived lack of credibility.          We do not agree.       The rule provides\n\nthat public records are not excluded by the hearsay rule \"unless\n\nthe sources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of\n\ntrustworthiness.\"         Fed. R. Evid. 803(8).      Trustworthiness in this\n\ncontext refers to matters such as whether the evidence is self-\n\nauthenticating      or    contemporaneously      compiled      by    a    person   of\n\nadequate skill and experience. See Beech Aircraft Corp. v. Rainey,\n\n488 U.S. 153, 167 n.11 (1988); FDIC v. Houde, 90 F.3d 600, 606 (1st\n\nCir. 1996); see also Fed. R. Evid. 803 advisory comm. notes to ¶\n\n(8), subsection (c).            As the district court's explication makes\n\nplain, the court did not base its ruling on the manner in which the\n\ndeath    certificate      was    completed,    the   sources    of       information\n\nutilized, the credentials of the person completing it, or how the\n\nrecord was maintained.           Instead, the court premised its ruling on\n\nthe substance of what the death certificate contained.                     This was\n\nerror:     Rule 803(8) does not authorize a trial court to deem\n\nevidence untrustworthy (and thus inadmissible) simply because the\n\ncourt finds the gist of the evidence incredible or unpersuasive.\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\f          For   these     reasons,    we    conclude   that    the    mid-trial\n\nredaction of the death certificate, based on the district court's\n\nassessment that it lacked credibility, constituted error.\n\n                     B.    Was the Error Harmless?\n\n          Our   determination    that       the   district    court   erred   in\n\nredacting the death certificate on the basis of a credibility\n\ndetermination does not end our inquiry.           That error necessitates a\n\nnew trial only if it affected the plaintiffs' substantial rights.\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 61.        The test for harmless error in this case\n\ntherefore depends on whether the erroneous exclusion of evidence\n\n\"result[ed] in actual prejudice because it had a substantial and\n\ninjurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict.\"\n\nRuiz-Troche v. Pepsi Cola Bottling Co., 161 F.3d 77, 87 (1st Cir.\n\n1998) (citation omitted).      Because this determination is context-\n\nspecific, Nieves-Villanueva v. Soto-Rivera, 133 F.3d 92, 102 (1st\n\nCir. 1997), we can sustain the instant verdict only if we can say\n\nwith fair assurance, after whole-record review, that the lower\n\ncourt's mid-trial redaction of the death certificate did not\n\nsubstantially affect the jury's ultimate decision.              See Kotteakos\n\nv. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 765 (1946).\n\n          Applying   this    standard,      we    conclude    that    the   error\n\nrequires vacation of the judgment on the state-law claims. We rest\n\nthis conclusion in substantial part on the district court's own\n\nassessment of the situation.          The court candidly described the\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fessential role that the death certificate played in the plaintiffs'\n\npresentation of their malpractice claims, calling the stricken\n\nlanguage \"the centerpiece of the Blakes' theory.\"                 Blake, 206 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 176.         The court went on to conclude that if its\n\nredaction of the document entailed error, that error \"was not\n\nharmless.\"       Id. at 177.\n\n               We do not take these conclusions lightly. Trials are, by\n\ntheir nature, dynamic and highly nuanced affairs.                 The district\n\ncourt    had    first-hand     knowledge   of   the   ebb   and   flow   of   the\n\nproceedings — knowledge that cannot fully be replicated by reading\n\na cold appellate record.         Consequently, we accord great respect to\n\nits conclusion regarding the centrality of the redacted language.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Shay, 57 F.3d 126, 134 & n.7 (1st Cir.\n\n1995).    The court's appraisal of the effect of the redaction is\n\nequally deserving of deference.            See Long v. Cotrell, Inc., 265\n\nF.3d 663, 667 (8th Cir. 2001) (noting that the trial court is in a\n\nsuperior position to measure the effects of trial error); cf.\n\nWhiting v. Westray, 294 F.3d 943, 944 (7th Cir. 2002) (deferring to\n\ntrial judge's determination of harmlessness of attorney misconduct\n\nin ruling on motion for a new trial).\n\n               Here, moreover, the timing of the redaction — on the\n\nseventeenth day of a twenty day trial and after the plaintiffs had\n\nrested — magnifies the prejudice occasioned by the error.                     The\n\nplaintiffs had gone out on a limb and built their case around the\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fredacted language — a reasonable tactic, considering the district\n\ncourt's   denial     of    the    defendants'       motion    in    limine     and   its\n\nunconditional admission of the death certificate into evidence.\n\nThe court then abruptly reversed direction and sawed the limb off\n\nat the eleventh hour, bringing the plaintiffs' case down with it.\n\nIt is difficult to imagine a more prejudicial turn of events.4\n\n           To be sure, the district court attempted to ameliorate\n\nthe untoward effects of its about-face by instructing the jury not\n\nto draw any conclusions based on the fact of the redaction.                          But\n\nthis is not a garden-variety instance of allowing a jury to see\n\ntainted   evidence        and    then    excluding      it.        In   the   peculiar\n\ncircumstances of this case, we do not think that any curative\n\ninstruction would have sufficed.\n\n           The general rule is straightforward:                    courts \"normally\n\npresume   that   a   jury       will    follow    an   instruction      to    disregard\n\ninadmissible evidence inadvertently presented to it.\"                         Greer v.\n\nMiller, 483 U.S. 756, 766 n.8 (1987).               The exception to the general\n\nrule is equally straightforward:                 the usual presumption does not\n\n\n     4\n      The district court might have mitigated the potential\nprejudice had it taken a more cautious approach when considering\nthe motion in limine. For example, the court might have admitted\nthe evidence conditionally or withheld a ruling on the motion until\nthe case came into sharper focus. We hasten to add, however, that\nwe offer these suggestions principally for the guidance of other\ncourts in future cases — and we do so recognizing that hindsight is\nalways 20/20.   \"Trial judges, whose lot is often to make swift\nbattlefield decisions on tangled evidentiary matters, cannot be\nexpected to foretell the future with absolute accuracy.\" United\nStates v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1184 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n                                          -14-\n\fapply    when      there    is    an   \"overwhelming   probability\"      that    the\n\ninstruction will be ineffectual.                 Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U.S.\n\n200, 208 (1987).            Here, the likelihood is very great that the\n\nremoval of the evidence — what the district court termed \"the\n\ncenterpiece\" of the plaintiffs' case — was devastating.                    That is\n\nenough to warrant a new trial.              See Bruton v. United States, 391\n\nU.S. 123, 135 (1968) (noting that \"there are some contexts in which\n\nthe risk that the jury will not, or cannot, follow instructions is\n\nso great, and the consequences of failure so vital to the [party\n\nintroducing the evidence], that the practical and human limitations\n\nof the jury system cannot be ignored\"); cf. Anderson v. Butler, 858\n\nF.2d    16,   18    (1st    Cir.   1988)   (holding    that   when    evidence    is\n\npromised, and then not received, jurors likely will draw a \"heavy\"\n\nadverse inference from its non-appearance).\n\nIII.    THE REHABILITATION ACT CLAIM\n\n              There    is    an    additional      matter   that     warrants    our\n\nattention.      The jury found for the Hospital on the Rehabilitation\n\nAct claim, and the notice of appeal also brings that aspect of the\n\njudgment before us.\n\n              The Rehabilitation Act claim is structurally different\n\nfrom the state-law malpractice claims, and the plaintiffs, on\n\nappeal, have neither addressed any developed argumentation to this\n\naspect of the jury's verdict nor given any explanation as to how\n\nthe belated redaction of the death certificate prejudiced the\n\n\n                                          -15-\n\fpresentation of their Rehabilitation Act claim. By the same token,\n\nthey have not pursued their claim of error in the exclusion of\n\nrelevant medical records.     See supra.\n\n            It is a familiar rule in this circuit that when issues on\n\nappeal are unaccompanied by some meaningful effort at developed\n\nargumentation, they are deemed to have been abandoned.      See, e.g.,\n\nRyan v. Royal Ins. Co., 916 F.2d 731, 734 (1st Cir. 1990); United\n\nStates v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).        We therefore\n\naffirm the judgment entered in favor of the Hospital on the\n\nRehabilitation Act claim.\n\n            To be sure, this removes from the framework of the case\n\nthe hook upon which federal jurisdiction originally hung and leaves\n\nthe district court, on remand, with only the state-law claims\n\nagainst the physician-defendants.       The district court nonetheless\n\nhas   the   option   of   retaining   supplemental   jurisdiction   and\n\nproceeding to retry the case.         See Rodriguez v. Doral Mortgage\n\nCorp., 57 F.3d 1168, 1177 (1st Cir. 1995) (holding that on remand\n\na district court has discretion, after assessing the totality of\n\nthe circumstances, to retain supplemental jurisdiction over state-\n\nlaw claims \"notwithstanding the . . . demise of all foundational\n\nfederal claims\").\n\nIV.   CONCLUSION\n\n            We need go no further.     We affirm the judgment in favor\n\nof the Hospital on the Rehabilitation Act claim but vacate the\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\fjudgment in favor of the physician-defendants on the state-law\n\nclaims and remand that aspect of the case for a new trial.                 By\n\nredacting the operative cause of death language from the death\n\ncertificate on the ground that it lacked persuasive force, the\n\ndistrict court invaded the jury's province and thus exceeded the\n\nscope of its discretion.       Occurring, as it did, near the end of a\n\nlong trial, the probability is intolerably high that this error\n\nunfairly caused the plaintiffs' trial strategy to boomerang and\n\ncontaminated the ensuing verdict on the state-law claims.\n\n           Let us be perfectly clear.        We do not hold that the death\n\ncertificate must be admitted into evidence at a subsequent trial.\n\nThere may be grounds for its exclusion apart from the deficient\n\nground relied upon by the district court.           See, e.g., Freeman v.\n\nPackage Mach. Co., 865 F.2d 1331, 1340 (1st Cir. 1988) (discussing\n\ntrial courts' wide discretion in admitting or excluding evidence\n\nunder Fed. R. Evid. 403).      That question is not before us, however,\n\nand we express no opinion on it.          After all, \"when a trial court\n\nerroneously excludes evidence, and the exclusion meets the standard\n\ncriteria   of   harmfulness,    the   harm    is   not   cured   by   a   mere\n\npossibility that other appropriate grounds for exclusion of the\n\nsame evidence may later be found to exist.\"         Ruiz-Troche, 161 F.3d\n\nat 88.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\f          The judgment in favor of Southcoast Health Systems, Inc.,\n\nd/b/a Charlton Memorial Hospital is affirmed.     The judgment in\n\nfavor of the physician-defendants is vacated and the case is\n\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nCosts are awarded to the plaintiffs as against the physician-\n\ndefendants.\n\n\n\n\n                               -18-\n\f",

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 30, 1998, Betty Ann Blake, a profoundly disabled woman in her mid-forties, was eating her mid-day meal at a daycare facility. A piece of meat lodged in her throat. She was taken to the emergency room at Charlton Memorial Hospital (the Hospital) in Fall River, Massachusetts. Although laypersons speculated that Betty Ann might be choking, she apparently refused to open her mouth and the doctors on duty did not conduct a full examination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Betty Ann was admitted to the Hospital. The following day, she had a seizure and began to display labored breathing. The doctors performed an esophagoscopy. During the procedure, they discovered a bolus of meat in Betty Ann's esophagus and dislodged it. Shortly thereafter, Betty Ann suffered a heart attack. She died on November 1, 1998 (approximately twenty-four hours after physicians removed the piece of meat from her esophagus). The death certificate filed by the medical examiner listed \"complications of asphyxia by choking\" as the cause of death.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Betty Ann's parents, William and Theresa Blake, individually and as co-administrators of her estate, subsequently sued the Hospital and a trio of physicians (Drs. Michael Pellegrino, Miguel Brillantes, and Thomas Cahill). Their complaint, filed in the federal district court, charged that the defendants had negligently failed to diagnose Betty Ann's condition and had discriminated against her in violation of Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 12181-12189, and the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 701-796l. In the course of pretrial proceedings, the district court dismissed the ADA claim and granted summary judgment for the physician-defendants on the Rehabilitation Act claim. The plaintiffs have not appealed from those orders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case went to trial on the remaining counts, which included the Rehabilitation Act claim against the Hospital, <i>see</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 794, and state-law claims, grounded in malpractice, for wrongful death and negligent infliction of emotional distress against the physicians. At the start of the trial, the physician-defendants moved in limine to exclude the death certificate. The court ruled that the death certificate constituted admissible evidence and denied the motion. The plaintiffs promptly introduced it into evidence and published it to the jury. The court then allowed the jurors to inspect copies of the death certificate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the fifteenth day of trial, the plaintiffs rested. The physician-defendants moved, inter alia, to strike the listed cause of death from the death certificate. The plaintiffs objected. On the seventeenth day of trial &#8212; before the defendants had presented any evidence &#8212; the district judge excised the words \"asphyxia by choking\" from the death certificate, stating that he had come to believe that Betty Ann's death was \"not caused by `complications of asphyxia by choking' as that phrase was understood either by a layperson or by physicians.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial lasted another three days. After final arguments and the court's charge, the jury commenced its deliberations. On November 26, 2001, the jury returned a verdict for the Hospital on the Rehabilitation Act count but informed the court that it had reached an impasse on the remaining claims. The court gave the deadlocked jurors a modified <i>Allen</i> charge, <i>see Allen v. United States,</i> 164 U.S. 492, 501, 17 S.Ct. 154, 41 L.Ed. 528 (1896); <i>United States v. Keene,</i> 287 F.3d 229, 235 (1st Cir.2002), and directed them to resume deliberations. On November 27, the jury returned an across-the-board verdict for the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs filed a timely motion for a new trial. Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(a). As to the state-law claims, they argued that the district court had erred in redacting the death certificate, and, moreover, that the timing of the court's actions &#8212; allowing them to introduce the unredacted death certificate, publish it to the jury, and build their case around it, and then striking the pivotal language &#8212; had doomed their chances of prevailing. As to the Rehabilitation Act claim, the plaintiffs sought a new trial based on the district court's exclusion of medical records of non-disabled patients. The lower court took the matter under advisement. It eventually denied the motion in a written opinion. <i>See Blake v. Southcoast Health Sys., Inc.,</i> 206 F.Supp.2d 174 (D.Mass.2002). The court insisted that none of its actions constituted error. <i>Id.</i> at 182. With admirable candor, however, the court conceded that if it had erred in the mid-trial redaction of the death certificate, its error was not harmless (and, thus, would require a new trial). <i>Id.</i> at 177. This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. THE STATE-LAW CLAIMS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue that lies at the heart of this appeal relates to the trial court's handling of an evidentiary matter. When an issue as to the admission or exclusion of evidence involves a question of law, such as the proper interpretation of a provision contained in the Federal Rules of Evidence, we afford de novo review. <i>Crowley v. L.L. Bean, Inc.,</i> 303 F.3d 387, 394 (1st Cir.2002). When, however, the issue involves an application of a given rule of evidence to particular facts or a judgment call about, say, relevancy, we review solely for abuse of discretion. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Identifying the precise question at issue in this appeal poses certain complications. These complications arise primarily from the parties' disagreement about whether federal or state law governs the admissibility vel non of the death certificate. The plaintiffs argue that state law controls because, by statute in Massachusetts, a party is entitled not only to introduce an official death certificate but also to have it serve as prima facie evidence of the cause of death. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 46, &#167; 19. In the plaintiffs' view, the Federal Rules of Evidence \"are not intended to substitute for, or trump, a clear state <i>substantive</i> right to have certain evidence admitted in a state tort death claim.\" Br. of Appellants at 27. The defendants argue to the contrary, asserting the primacy of the Federal Rules of Evidence. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Br. of Physician-Appellees at 25 (\"The fact that a state statute also existed regarding the admissibility of the death certificate [does] not trump the force of the Federal Rules of Evidence.\"). Although this is an interesting pedagogical debate, we do not resolve it here. Assuming arguendo that the Federal Rules of Evidence govern &#8212; an assumption consistent with the district court's position and optimally favorable to the defendants &#8212; the district court's handling of the evidence, as we explain below, does not pass muster.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>The Error.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fundamental question posed in this case implicates the division of responsibility between judge and jury. It asks whether a judge, presiding over a jury trial, may rule on the admissibility of evidence based upon his view of the persuasiveness of that evidence. In other words, may a trial judge refuse to admit evidence simply because he does not believe the truth of the proposition that the evidence asserts? In the circumstances of this case, we answer that question in the negative.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The disputed evidence in this case &#8212; the cause of death specified in the death certificate &#8212; was plainly relevant to the issues before the court. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 401. Even so, a district court has the authority to exclude relevant evidence for various reasons. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Fed.R.Evid. 403 (allowing the exclusion of evidence if the court finds that its probative value is substantially outweighed by its unfairly prejudicial effect, or that the evidence would tend to confuse or mislead the jury). But none of these mechanisms allows a trial judge to remove relevant evidence from the jury's universe solely because he finds the evidence unpersuasive. Perhaps more importantly, the trial judge in this case did not invoke any of them. Indeed, the judge made it very clear that persuasiveness (or the lack of it) was the perceived problem. <i>See Blake,</i> 206 F.Supp.2d at 177 (attributing the decision to redact to the fact that \"the Court was no longer persuaded by the fair preponderance of the evidence that `complications of asphyxia by choking' was the primary cause of Betty Ann Blake's death\"); <i>id.</i> at 176-77 (\"As the trial progressed... it became increasingly evident [to me] that, whatever had caused the death of Betty Ann Blake after twenty-seven hours of suffering, it was not `complications of asphyxia by choking.'\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question reduces, therefore, to whether, in the absence of special circumstances, <i>see supra</i> note 3, a trial judge has the authority to exclude evidence on the basis of his own belief as to the persuasiveness of that evidence. We conclude that, in a jury trial, no such authority exists. After all, the jury is the factfinder, and \"the ultimate arbiter of the persuasiveness of the proof must be the factfinder, not the lawgiver.\" <i>Greenburg v. P.R. Maritime Shipping Auth.,</i> 835 F.2d 932, 937 (1st Cir.1987). This premise has gone unchanged over the years. <i>See, e.g., Gallick v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. Co.,</i> 372 U.S. 108, 114-15, 83 S.Ct. 659, 9 L.Ed.2d 618 (1963); <i>Tennant v. Peoria &amp; Pekin Union Ry. Co.,</i> 321 U.S. 29, 35, 64 S.Ct. 409, 88 L.Ed. 520 (1944). \"It is the jury, not the court, which is the fact-finding body. It weighs the contradictory evidence and inferences, judges the credibility of witnesses ... and draws the ultimate conclusions as to the facts.\" <i>Boston &amp; Me. R.R. v. Cabana,</i> 148 F.2d 150, 152 (1st Cir.1945) (citing <i>Tennant,</i> 321 U.S. at 35, 64 S.Ct. 409).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In arrogating unto itself the power to evaluate the persuasiveness of the medical examiner's conclusion about the cause of death, memorialized in the death certificate, the district court adverted to Fed.R.Evid. 104(a) and Fed.R.Evid. 803(8) as the wellsprings of its authority. Neither of these rules adequately underpins the court's action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Evid. 104(a) provides in pertinent part that \"[p]reliminary questions concerning ... the admissibility of evidence shall be determined by the court.\" This rule enables a trial judge to decide whether foundational facts have been established (and, thus, whether particular pieces of evidence are eligible for admission). <i>See Sacramona v. Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc.,</i> 106 F.3d 444, 446 (1st Cir.1997). The trial court \"act[s] as a gatekeeper\" when such issues arise. <i>United States v. Holmquist,</i> 36 F.3d 154, 167 (1st Cir.1994). \"If the court discerns enough support in the record to warrant a reasonable person in determining that the evidence [could support that which it sets out to support, then] the weight to be given to the evidence is left to the jury.\" <i>United States v. Paulino,</i> 13 F.3d 20, 23 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 104(a) is inapposite here, for no foundational facts were in issue. Virtually by definition, foundational facts are those facts upon which the admissibility of evidence rests. <i>See United States v. Piper,</i> 298 F.3d 47, 52 (1st Cir.2002); <i>Paulino,</i> 13 F.3d at 23. Those facts include matters such as the genuineness of a document or statement, the maker's personal knowledge, and the like. <i>See, e.g., Newton v. Ryder Transp. Servs.,</i> 206 F.3d 772, 775 (8th Cir.2000); <i>Ricketts v. City of Hartford,</i> 74 F.3d 1397, 1410 (2d Cir.1996); <i>Onujiogu v. United States,</i> 817 F.2d 3, 5 (1st Cir.1987). In this instance, those facts (e.g., the authenticity of the death certificate and the authority of the medical examiner to sign it) were never in dispute. The district court's problem did not go to any foundational fact, but, rather, to the very core of the evidence: its persuasiveness. Where, as here, a piece of evidence rests upon a proper foundation, Rule 104(a) does not permit a trial judge to usurp the jury's function and exclude the evidence based on the judge's determination that it lacks persuasive force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also suggested that Fed.R.Evid. 803(8) empowered it to redact the death certificate based on the perceived lack of credibility. We do not agree. The rule provides that public records are not excluded by the hearsay rule \"unless the sources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness.\" Fed.R.Evid. 803(8). Trustworthiness in this context refers to matters such as whether the evidence is self-authenticating or contemporaneously compiled by a person of adequate skill and experience. <i>See Beech Aircraft Corp. v. Rainey,</i> 488 U.S. 153, 167 n. 11, 109 S.Ct. 439, 102 L.Ed.2d 445 (1988); <i>FDIC v. Houde,</i> 90 F.3d 600, 606 (1st Cir.1996); <i>see also</i> Fed.R.Evid. 803 advisory comm. notes to &#182; (8), subsection (c). As the district court's explication makes plain, the court did not base its ruling on the manner in which the death certificate was completed, the sources of information utilized, the credentials of the person completing it, or how the record was maintained. Instead, the court premised its ruling on the substance of what the death certificate contained. This was error: Rule 803(8) does not authorize a trial court to deem evidence untrustworthy (and thus inadmissible) simply because the court finds the gist of the evidence incredible or unpersuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we conclude that the mid-trial redaction of the death certificate, based on the district court's assessment that it lacked credibility, constituted error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Was the Error Harmless?</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our determination that the district court erred in redacting the death certificate on the basis of a credibility determination does not end our inquiry. That error necessitates a new trial only if it affected the plaintiffs' substantial rights. Fed.R.Civ.P. 61. The test for harmless error in this case therefore depends on whether the erroneous exclusion of evidence \"result[ed] in actual prejudice because it had a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict.\" <i>Ruiz-Troche v. Pepsi Cola Bottling Co.,</i> 161 F.3d 77, 87 (1st Cir.1998) (citation omitted). Because this determination is context-specific, <i>Nieves-Villanueva v. Soto-Rivera,</i> 133 F.3d 92, 102 (1st Cir.1997), we can sustain the instant verdict only if we can say with fair assurance, after whole-record review, that the lower court's mid-trial redaction of the death certificate did not substantially affect the jury's ultimate decision. <i>See Kotteakos v. United States,</i> 328 U.S. 750, 765, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying this standard, we conclude that the error requires vacation of the judgment on the state-law claims. We rest this conclusion in substantial part on the district court's own assessment of the situation. The court candidly described the essential role that the death certificate played in the plaintiffs' presentation of their malpractice claims, calling the stricken language \"the centerpiece of the Blakes' theory.\" <i>Blake,</i> 206 F.Supp.2d at 176. The court went on to conclude that if its redaction of the document entailed error, that error \"was not harmless.\" <i>Id.</i> at 177.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not take these conclusions lightly. Trials are, by their nature, dynamic and highly nuanced affairs. The district court had first-hand knowledge of the ebb and flow of the proceedings &#8212; knowledge that cannot fully be replicated by reading a cold appellate record. Consequently, we accord great respect to its conclusion regarding the centrality of the redacted language. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Shay,</i> 57 F.3d 126, 134 &amp; n. 7 (1st Cir.1995). The court's appraisal of the effect of the redaction is equally deserving of deference. <i>See Long v. Cottrell, Inc.,</i> 265 F.3d 663, 667 (8th Cir.2001) (noting that the trial court is in a superior position to measure the effects of trial error); <i>cf. Whiting v. Westray,</i> 294 F.3d 943, 944 (7th Cir.2002) (deferring to trial judge's determination of harmlessness of attorney misconduct in ruling on motion for a new trial).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, moreover, the timing of the redaction &#8212; on the seventeenth day of a twenty day trial and after the plaintiffs had rested &#8212; magnifies the prejudice occasioned by the error. The plaintiffs had gone out on a limb and built their case around the redacted language &#8212; a reasonable tactic, considering the district court's denial of the defendants' motion in limine and its unconditional admission of the death certificate into evidence. The court then abruptly reversed direction and sawed the limb off at the eleventh hour, bringing the plaintiffs' case down with it. It is difficult to imagine a more prejudicial turn of events.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the district court attempted to ameliorate the untoward effects of its about-face by instructing the jury not to draw any conclusions based on the fact of the redaction. But this is not a garden-variety instance of allowing a jury to see tainted evidence and then excluding it. In the peculiar circumstances of this case, we do not think that any curative instruction would have sufficed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The general rule is straightforward: courts \"normally presume that a jury will follow an instruction to disregard inadmissible evidence inadvertently presented to it.\" <i>Greer v. Miller,</i> 483 U.S. 756, 766 n. 8, 107 S.Ct. 3102, 97 L.Ed.2d 618 (1987). The exception to the general rule is equally straightforward: the usual presumption does not apply when there is an \"overwhelming probability\" that the instruction will be ineffectual. <i>Richardson v. Marsh,</i> 481 U.S. 200, 208, 107 S.Ct. 1702, 95 L.Ed.2d 176 (1987). Here, the likelihood is very great that the removal of the evidence &#8212; what the district court termed \"the centerpiece\" of the plaintiffs' case &#8212; was devastating. That is enough to warrant a new trial. <i>See Bruton v. United States,</i> 391 U.S. 123, 135, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968) (noting that \"there are some contexts in which the risk that the jury will not, or cannot, follow instructions is so great, and the consequences of failure so vital to the [party introducing the evidence], that the practical and human limitations of the jury system cannot be ignored\"); <i>cf. Anderson v. Butler,</i> 858 F.2d 16, 18 (1st Cir.1988) (holding that when evidence is promised, and then not received, jurors likely will draw a \"heavy\" adverse inference from its non-appearance).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE REHABILITATION ACT CLAIM</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is an additional matter that warrants our attention. The jury found for the Hospital on the Rehabilitation Act claim, and the notice of appeal also brings that aspect of the judgment before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Rehabilitation Act claim is structurally different from the state-law malpractice claims, and the plaintiffs, on appeal, have neither addressed any developed argumentation to this aspect of the jury's verdict nor given any explanation as to how the belated redaction of the death certificate prejudiced the presentation of their Rehabilitation Act claim. By the same token, they have not pursued their claim of error in the exclusion of relevant medical records. <i>See supra.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is a familiar rule in this circuit that when issues on appeal are unaccompanied by some meaningful effort at developed argumentation, they are deemed to have been abandoned. <i>See, e.g., Ryan v. Royal Ins. Co.,</i> 916 F.2d 731, 734 (1st Cir.1990); <i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990). We therefore affirm the judgment entered in favor of the Hospital on the Rehabilitation Act claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, this removes from the framework of the case the hook upon which federal jurisdiction originally hung and leaves the district court, on remand, with only the state-law claims against the physician-defendants. The district court nonetheless has the option of retaining supplemental jurisdiction and proceeding to retry the case. <i>See Rodriguez v. Doral Mortgage Corp.,</i> 57 F.3d 1168, 1177 (1st Cir.1995) (holding that on remand a district court has discretion, after assessing the totality of the circumstances, to retain supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims \"notwithstanding the ... demise of all foundational federal claims\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. We affirm the judgment in favor of the Hospital on the Rehabilitation Act claim but vacate the judgment in favor of the physician-defendants on the state-law claims and remand that aspect of the case for a new trial. By redacting the operative cause of death language from the death certificate on the ground that it lacked persuasive force, the district court invaded the jury's province and thus exceeded the scope of its discretion. Occurring, as it did, near the end of a long trial, the probability is intolerably high that this error unfairly caused the plaintiffs' trial strategy to boomerang and contaminated the ensuing verdict on the state-law claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let us be perfectly clear. We do not hold that the death certificate must be admitted into evidence at a subsequent trial. There may be grounds for its exclusion apart from the deficient ground relied upon by the district court. <i>See, e.g., Freeman v. Package Mach. Co.,</i> 865 F.2d 1331, 1340 (1st Cir.1988) (discussing trial courts' wide discretion in admitting or excluding evidence under Fed.R.Evid. 403). That question is not before us, however, and we express no opinion on it. After all, \"when a trial court erroneously excludes evidence, and the exclusion meets the standard criteria of harmfulness, the harm is not cured by a mere possibility that other appropriate grounds for exclusion of the same evidence may later be found to exist.\" <i>Ruiz-Troche,</i> 161 F.3d at 88.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>The judgment in favor of Southcoast Health Systems, Inc., d/b/a Charlton Memorial Hospital is affirmed.

By aspiration, the defendants meant \"the effects of saliva going down into the lungs ... which can lead to infection, fluid in the lungs, and then death if left untreated.\" Br. of the Physician-Appellees at 23. This was a more likely cause of death than asphyxia, they posited, inasmuch as Betty Ann \"did not suffer an obstruction of her airway at any time when she was in the hospital.\"<i>Id.</i></p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Of course, there are specific circumstances in which a trial judge's view of the credibility of the evidence is an important variable in the calculus of admissibility. The most obvious example is in a so-called<i>Daubert</i> hearing. <i>See Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc.,</i> 509 U.S. 579, 597, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993) (explaining that \"the Rules of Evidence... assign to the trial judge the task of ensuring that an expert's testimony ... rests on a reliable foundation\"); <i>see also United States v. Sebaggala,</i> 256 F.3d 59, 65-66 (1st Cir.2001) (discussing a trial court's considerable latitude in the admission and exclusion of expert testimony under Fed.R.Evid. 702).

For example, the court might have admitted the evidence conditionally or withheld a ruling on the motion until the case came into sharper focus. We hasten to add, however, that we offer these suggestions principally for the guidance of other courts in future cases &#8212; and we do so recognizing that hindsight is always 20/20. \"Trial judges, whose lot is often to make swift battlefield decisions on tangled evidentiary matters, cannot be expected to foretell the future with absolute accuracy.\"<i>United States v.

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 30, 1998, Betty Ann Blake, a profoundly disabled woman in her mid-forties, was eating her mid-day meal at a daycare facility. A piece of meat lodged in her throat. She was taken to the emergency room at Charlton Memorial Hospital (the Hospital) in Fall River, Massachusetts. Although laypersons speculated that Betty Ann might be choking, she apparently refused to open her mouth and the doctors on duty did not conduct a full examination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Betty Ann was admitted to the Hospital. The following day, she had a seizure and began to display labored breathing. The doctors performed an esophagoscopy. During the procedure, they discovered a bolus of meat in Betty Ann's esophagus and dislodged it. Shortly thereafter, Betty Ann suffered a heart attack. She died on November 1, 1998 (approximately twenty-four hours after physicians removed the piece of meat from her esophagus). The death certificate filed by the medical examiner listed \"complications of asphyxia by choking\" as the cause of death.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Betty Ann's parents, William and Theresa Blake, individually and as co-administrators of her estate, subsequently sued the Hospital and a trio of physicians (Drs. Michael Pellegrino, Miguel Brillantes, and Thomas Cahill). Their complaint, filed in the federal district court, charged that the defendants had negligently failed to diagnose Betty Ann's condition and had discriminated against her in violation of Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 12181-12189, and the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 701-796l. In the course of pretrial proceedings, the district court dismissed the ADA claim and granted summary judgment for the physician-defendants on the Rehabilitation Act claim. The plaintiffs have not appealed from those orders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case went to trial on the remaining counts, which included the Rehabilitation Act claim against the Hospital, <i>see</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 794, and state-law claims, grounded in malpractice, for wrongful death and negligent infliction of emotional distress against the physicians. At the start of the trial, the physician-defendants moved in limine to exclude the death certificate. The court ruled that the death certificate constituted admissible evidence and denied the motion. The plaintiffs promptly introduced it into evidence and published it to the jury. The court then allowed the jurors to inspect copies of the death certificate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the fifteenth day of trial, the plaintiffs rested. The physician-defendants moved, inter alia, to strike the listed cause of death from the death certificate. The plaintiffs objected. On the seventeenth day of trial &#8212; before the defendants had presented any evidence &#8212; the district judge excised the words \"asphyxia by choking\" from the death certificate, stating that he had come to believe that Betty Ann's death was \"not caused by `complications of asphyxia by choking' as that phrase was understood either by a layperson or by physicians.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial lasted another three days. After final arguments and the court's charge, the jury commenced its deliberations. On November 26, 2001, the jury returned a verdict for the Hospital on the Rehabilitation Act count but informed the court that it had reached an impasse on the remaining claims. The court gave the deadlocked jurors a modified <i>Allen</i> charge, <i>see Allen v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"94565\"><a href=\"/opinion/94565/allen-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></a></span>, 501, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

On November 27, the jury returned an across-the-board verdict for the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs filed a timely motion for a new trial. Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(a). As to the state-law claims, they argued that the district court had erred in redacting the death certificate, and, moreover, that the timing of the court's actions &#8212; allowing them to introduce the unredacted death certificate, publish it to the jury, and build their case around it, and then striking the pivotal language &#8212; had doomed their chances of prevailing. As to the Rehabilitation Act claim, the plaintiffs sought a new trial based on the district court's exclusion of medical records of non-disabled patients. The lower court took the matter under advisement. It eventually denied the motion in a written opinion. <i>See Blake v. Southcoast Health Sys., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2433023\"><a href=\"/opinion/2433023/blake-v-southcoast-health-system-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">206</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">174</span></a></span> (D.Mass.2002). The court insisted that none of its actions constituted error. <i>Id.</i> at 182. With admirable candor, however, the court conceded that if it had erred in the mid-trial redaction of the death certificate, its error was not harmless (and, thus, would require a new trial). <i>Id.</i> at 177. This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. THE STATE-LAW CLAIMS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue that lies at the heart of this appeal relates to the trial court's handling of an evidentiary matter. When an issue as to the admission or exclusion of evidence involves a question of law, such as the proper interpretation of a provision contained in the Federal Rules of Evidence, we afford de novo review. <i>Crowley v. L.L. Bean, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200130\"><a href=\"/opinion/200130/crowley-v-ll-bean-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">387</span></a></span>, 394 (1st Cir.2002). When, however, the issue involves an application of a given rule of evidence to particular facts or a judgment call about, say, relevancy, we review solely for abuse of discretion. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Identifying the precise question at issue in this appeal poses certain complications. These complications arise primarily from the parties' disagreement about whether federal or state law governs the admissibility vel non of the death certificate. The plaintiffs argue that state law controls because, by statute in Massachusetts, a party is entitled not only to introduce an official death certificate but also to have it serve as prima facie evidence of the cause of death. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 46, &#167; 19. In the plaintiffs' view, the Federal Rules of Evidence \"are not intended to substitute for, or trump, a clear state <i>substantive</i> right to have certain evidence admitted in a state tort death claim.\" Br. of Appellants at 27. The defendants argue to the contrary, asserting the primacy of the Federal Rules of Evidence. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Br. of Physician-Appellees at 25 (\"The fact that a state statute also existed regarding the admissibility of the death certificate [does] not trump the force of the Federal Rules of Evidence.\"). Although this is an interesting pedagogical debate, we do not resolve it here. Assuming arguendo that the Federal Rules of Evidence govern &#8212; an assumption consistent with the district court's position and optimally favorable to the defendants &#8212; the district court's handling of the evidence, as we explain below, does not pass muster.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>The Error.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fundamental question posed in this case implicates the division of responsibility between judge and jury. It asks whether a judge, presiding over a jury trial, may rule on the admissibility of evidence based upon his view of the persuasiveness of that evidence. In other words, may a trial judge refuse to admit evidence simply because he does not believe the truth of the proposition that the evidence asserts? In the circumstances of this case, we answer that question in the negative.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The disputed evidence in this case &#8212; the cause of death specified in the death certificate &#8212; was plainly relevant to the issues before the court. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 401. Even so, a district court has the authority to exclude relevant evidence for various reasons. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Fed.R.Evid. 403 (allowing the exclusion of evidence if the court finds that its probative value is substantially outweighed by its unfairly prejudicial effect, or that the evidence would tend to confuse or mislead the jury). But none of these mechanisms allows a trial judge to remove relevant evidence from the jury's universe solely because he finds the evidence unpersuasive. Perhaps more importantly, the trial judge in this case did not invoke any of them. Indeed, the judge made it very clear that persuasiveness (or the lack of it) was the perceived problem. <i>See Blake,</i> 206 F.Supp.2d at 177 (attributing the decision to redact to the fact that \"the Court was no longer persuaded by the fair preponderance of the evidence that `complications of asphyxia by choking' was the primary cause of Betty Ann Blake's death\"); <i>id.</i> at 176-77 (\"As the trial progressed... it became increasingly evident [to me] that, whatever had caused the death of Betty Ann Blake after twenty-seven hours of suffering, it was not `complications of asphyxia by choking.'\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question reduces, therefore, to whether, in the absence of special circumstances, <i>see supra</i> note 3, a trial judge has the authority to exclude evidence on the basis of his own belief as to the persuasiveness of that evidence. We conclude that, in a jury trial, no such authority exists. After all, the jury is the factfinder, and \"the ultimate arbiter of the persuasiveness of the proof must be the factfinder, not the lawgiver.\" <i>Greenburg v. P.R.

In this instance, those facts (e.g., the authenticity of the death certificate and the authority of the medical examiner to sign it) were never in dispute. The district court's problem did not go to any foundational fact, but, rather, to the very core of the evidence: its persuasiveness. Where, as here, a piece of evidence rests upon a proper foundation, Rule 104(a) does not permit a trial judge to usurp the jury's function and exclude the evidence based on the judge's determination that it lacks persuasive force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also suggested that Fed.R.Evid. 803(8) empowered it to redact the death certificate based on the perceived lack of credibility.

The rule provides that public records are not excluded by the hearsay rule \"unless the sources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness.\" Fed.R.Evid. 803(8). Trustworthiness in this context refers to matters such as whether the evidence is self-authenticating or contemporaneously compiled by a person of adequate skill and experience. <i>See Beech Aircraft Corp. v.

As the district court's explication makes plain, the court did not base its ruling on the manner in which the death certificate was completed, the sources of information utilized, the credentials of the person completing it, or how the record was maintained. Instead, the court premised its ruling on the substance of what the death certificate contained. This was error: Rule 803(8) does not authorize a trial court to deem evidence untrustworthy (and thus inadmissible) simply because the court finds the gist of the evidence incredible or unpersuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we conclude that the mid-trial redaction of the death certificate, based on the district court's assessment that it lacked credibility, constituted error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Was the Error Harmless?</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our determination that the district court erred in redacting the death certificate on the basis of a credibility determination does not end our inquiry.

We rest this conclusion in substantial part on the district court's own assessment of the situation. The court candidly described the essential role that the death certificate played in the plaintiffs' presentation of their malpractice claims, calling the stricken language \"the centerpiece of the Blakes' theory.\" <i>Blake,</i> 206 F.Supp.2d at 176. The court went on to conclude that if its redaction of the document entailed error, that error \"was not harmless.\" <i>Id.</i> at 177.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not take these conclusions lightly. Trials are, by their nature, dynamic and highly nuanced affairs. The district court had first-hand knowledge of the ebb and flow of the proceedings &#8212; knowledge that cannot fully be replicated by reading a cold appellate record. Consequently, we accord great respect to its conclusion regarding the centrality of the redacted language. <i>See, e.g., United States v.

The court's appraisal of the effect of the redaction is equally deserving of deference. <i>See Long v.

The plaintiffs had gone out on a limb and built their case around the redacted language &#8212; a reasonable tactic, considering the district court's denial of the defendants' motion in limine and its unconditional admission of the death certificate into evidence. The court then abruptly reversed direction and sawed the limb off at the eleventh hour, bringing the plaintiffs' case down with it.

By redacting the operative cause of death language from the death certificate on the ground that it lacked persuasive force, the district court invaded the jury's province and thus exceeded the scope of its discretion. Occurring, as it did, near the end of a long trial, the probability is intolerably high that this error unfairly caused the plaintiffs' trial strategy to boomerang and contaminated the ensuing verdict on the state-law claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let us be perfectly clear. We do not hold that the death certificate must be admitted into evidence at a subsequent trial. There may be grounds for its exclusion apart from the deficient ground relied upon by the district court. <i>See, e.g., Freeman v. Package Mach.

That question is not before us, however, and we express no opinion on it. After all, \"when a trial court erroneously excludes evidence, and the exclusion meets the standard criteria of harmfulness, the harm is not cured by a mere possibility that other appropriate grounds for exclusion of the same evidence may later be found to exist.\" <i>Ruiz-Troche,</i> 161 F.3d at 88.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>The judgment in favor of Southcoast Health Systems, Inc., d/b/a Charlton Memorial Hospital is affirmed.

By aspiration, the defendants meant \"the effects of saliva going down into the lungs ... which can lead to infection, fluid in the lungs, and then death if left untreated.\" Br. of the Physician-Appellees at 23. This was a more likely cause of death than asphyxia, they posited, inasmuch as Betty Ann \"did not suffer an obstruction of her airway at any time when she was in the hospital.\"<i>Id.</i></p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Of course, there are specific circumstances in which a trial judge's view of the credibility of the evidence is an important variable in the calculus of admissibility.

We hasten to add, however, that we offer these suggestions principally for the guidance of other courts in future cases &#8212; and we do so recognizing that hindsight is always 20/20. \"Trial judges, whose lot is often to make swift battlefield decisions on tangled evidentiary matters, cannot be expected to foretell the future with absolute accuracy.\"<i>United States v.
