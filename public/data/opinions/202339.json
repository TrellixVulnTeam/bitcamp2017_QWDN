This is a case arising under the\n\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 1001-1461.       After a bench trial, plaintiff John J. Janeiro, Jr.\n\nwas awarded $195,036 in benefits, a sum that the district court\n\nheld had been wrongfully withheld from him by two retirement plans.\n\nThe plans were administered by the Urological Surgery Professional\n\nAssociation    (USPA),      and   their   primary    trustee     was    Edward    A.\n\nChibaro, Janeiro's former business partner.\n\n            On appeal, the main issue is what standard of review the\n\ndistrict    court    should   have   applied    to    the   benefits     claim   in\n\nevaluating the defendants' decisionmaking.              The standard varies,\n\ndepending on whether there was a conflict of interest.                  Defendants\n\nargue that they were entitled to greater deference from the court\n\nas to their repeated revaluations of, and delay in paying, the\n\namount due to Janeiro.        We disagree.     On these facts, the district\n\ncourt properly engaged in plenary review, in light of the conflict\n\nof interest of the plans' trustee, Chibaro.                 It then correctly\n\nfound for plaintiff on his benefits claim.\n\n            For     his   part,   Janeiro    has     cross-appealed,      seeking\n\nattorneys'    fees    and   prejudgment     interest.       We   hold    that    the\n\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in denying these\n\nrequests.    In sum, both the appeal and the cross-appeal fail.                  The\n\njudgment of the district court is affirmed in all respects.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f                                  I.\n\n                              Background\n\n           We describe the facts in the light most favorable to the\n\njudgment, drawing all reasonable inferences from the record in\n\nfavor of Janeiro as to the benefits claim, but in             favor of\n\ndefendants as to attorneys' fees and prejudgment interest.          See\n\nServicios Comerciales Andinos, S.A. v. Gen. Elec. Del Caribe, Inc.,\n\n145 F.3d 463, 466 (1st Cir. 1998); Wainwright Bank & Trust Co. v.\n\nBoulos, 89 F.3d 17, 19 (1st Cir. 1996).            Our summary is based\n\nlargely upon the district court's factual findings, in which we see\n\nno clear error.\n\nA.         The Plans\n\n           For over a decade, Janeiro was an employee of the USPA,\n\na medical practice.     He and Chibaro, both doctors, were co-owners\n\nof the practice.       The USPA was, and still is, the sponsor and\n\nadministrator of two pension benefit plans governed by ERISA: the\n\nMoney Purchase Pension Plan and Trust, and the Profit Sharing Plan\n\nand Trust.   Janeiro participated in both plans.\n\n           The Money Purchase Plan was funded by contributions from\n\nemployees' salaries, and the Profit Sharing Plan was funded by a\n\ncombination of employee and employer contributions.          Both plans\n\nwere   defined   contribution,   pooled    asset   plans.   Both   plans\n\nconsisted of several documents -- a Prototype Plan, an Adoption\n\nAgreement, a Trust Agreement, and a Summary Plan Description --\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fthat are, in all relevant respects, identical for each plan.\n\n              The pertinent terms created by the documents are these:\n\nFirst, § B.5.1 of each plan's Adoption Agreement provides that\n\n\"[t]here are no restrictions other than those of Article 10 in the\n\n[Prototype Plan] on when, following termination of employment, a\n\nparticipant may begin receiving benefits.\"                   Article 10 of the\n\nPrototype Plan, in turn, provides in § 10.1(b) that \"[u]nless a\n\nparticipant elects otherwise . . . , benefit distribution occurs\n\n(or begins) no later than the sixtieth day following the end of the\n\nplan   year    in    which    .    .   .   [the    participant]    terminates   his\n\nemployment with the employer.\" No other provision of Article 10 is\n\npertinent here.\n\n              Section B.5.1 of each plan's Adoption Agreement provides\n\nthat \"[w]hen an account balance becomes payable, it is paid in a\n\nlump   sum     at    the     valuation      date     following    the    occurrence\n\nprecipitating the disbursement.\" Under § B.4.1, \"[v]aluation dates\n\noccur at the end of each plan period.\"                The \"plan period\" was the\n\nsame as the \"plan year\": the calendar year, ending on the last day\n\nof December.\n\n              Section 6.2 of the Prototype Plan provides: \"Accounts are\n\nadjusted      to    reflect       investment      changes   on    each   adjustment\n\ndate. . . . Each valuation date is an adjustment date.                    The plan\n\nadministrator may also provide for an extraordinary adjustment date\n\n\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fwhenever market values of underlying assets have changed so much\n\nthat it would be inequitable to do otherwise.\"\n\n              Finally, under § 21.1 of the Prototype Plan, \"[t]he\n\nprincipal      employer       is     the     plan     administrator\"        and     \"has\n\ndiscretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits and\n\nto construe the terms of the plan.\"\n\n              This lawsuit concerns benefits under both plans.                      For\n\nconvenience, we refer to both as \"the plan,\" the usage adopted by\n\nthe district court.\n\n              Chibaro was listed on the plan as the individual trustee.\n\nAlthough Janeiro was named co-trustee in 1999 and signed some\n\ndocuments in that capacity, the district court found that he \"was\n\na   trustee    in    name   only,\"    and     that    Chibaro     was   the   one   who\n\n\"exclusively exercised\" both the responsibilities of trustee and\n\nthe   USPA's        responsibilities         of    plan     administration.          \"In\n\nparticular,\"        the   court     found,    \"it     was   Dr.   Chibaro     who   was\n\nexclusively responsible for interactions with both the plan's\n\ninvestment      advisor       and     the         third[-]party     administrator.\"\n\n              The    plan's    third-party          administrator       was   Fecteau\n\nAssociates, Inc. (\"Fecteau\"). Fecteau handled the annual valuation\n\nof plan assets.        It generated this information using a census form\n\nit sent to the USPA every December or January; a statement,\n\nobtained from the plan's investment advisor, of the value of the\n\nassets in the plan as of December 31; and other information,\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\fconcerning developments such as deposits and withdrawals, obtained\n\nfrom the USPA during the ordinary course of the year.         The court\n\nfound that it took the USPA roughly two hours to complete the\n\ncensus, and that it took five to ten hours for Fecteau to complete\n\nthe valuation once it had all the information.\n\nB.        The Business Breakup and the Benefits Dispute\n\n          In July of 2000, Janeiro gave notice that he intended to\n\nleave the USPA.    Thereafter, the relationship between Janeiro and\n\nChibaro was, in the district court's words, \"cold and at times very\n\ncontentious.\"      In   October   of   2000,   Janeiro   terminated   his\n\nemployment.     The next valuation date, which would apply in the\n\nordinary course, was December 31, 2000.\n\n          The district court found that both before and after\n\nDecember 31, 2000, Janeiro \"clearly and repeatedly communicated his\n\nintention to Dr. Chibaro . . . to withdraw his plan assets as soon\n\nas they could be withdrawn.\" In addition, several other terminated\n\nemployees and Chibaro's ex-wife, claiming by way of a recent\n\ndivorce, sought to obtain their share of assets as of the December\n\n31, 2000 valuation date.    In all, Chibaro knew that as of that date\n\nroughly 70% of the plan's assets would be departing.         Of the 30%\n\nremaining, 92% belonged to Chibaro.\n\n          The district court further found that the USPA had\n\nFecteau's 2000 annual census form in early January of 2001, but did\n\nnot complete and return it to Fecteau until March 12, 2001.\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fFecteau completed the valuation for December 31, 2000 (the first\n\nvaluation) and transmitted it to Chibaro by letter dated June 19,\n\n2001.   Janeiro's share of assets as of December 31, 2000 was valued\n\nat $651,680.\n\n           Importantly, between December of 2000 and June of 2001,\n\nthe market value of the plan assets declined.    The district court\n\nfound that Chibaro \"became concerned because . . . he didn't want\n\nto make money for other people that were leaving the plan, and in\n\neffect if Dr. Janeiro were to be paid the valuation as of December\n\n31, 2000, he would receive a greater percentage of the plan assets\n\nthan he would be entitled to if a new valuation was conducted.\"\n\nChibaro, who \"was determined to have the assets revalued,\" directed\n\nFecteau to revalue the assets, this time as of June 30, 2001 (the\n\nsecond valuation).     Fecteau did so, conveying the results to\n\nChibaro on August 10, 2001.   This time, Janeiro's share was valued\n\nat $603,052.   As the district court explained, the effect of the\n\nrevaluation \"was to transfer a loss that otherwise would have been\n\nborn[e] by the parties whose assets remained in the plan to the\n\nparties who were leaving.\"\n\n           At some point after August 10 and before September 11,\n\n2001, consent-to-distribution forms were distributed to Janeiro and\n\nthe other claimants.      Janeiro returned his completed form on\n\nSeptember 17, 2001. By then, the market had further declined, most\n\nnotably after September 11, 2001.      Chibaro had Fecteau perform\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fanother revaluation, this time as of October 31, 2001 (the third\n\nvaluation); the results were communicated to him on November 5,\n\n2001.       He did not notify the terminated employees about this\n\nrevaluation until November 30, and he did not provide them with\n\nconsent-to-distribution forms (which would have specified the value\n\nof their shares).\n\n             December 31, 2001 was the end of the plan year, and so\n\nwas a valuation date.    The valuation as of December 31, 2001 (the\n\nfourth valuation) was transmitted to Chibaro on April 30, 2002.1\n\nIn April of 2002, consent-to-distribution forms were distributed,\n\nbut this time Janeiro did not sign or return his.\n\n             On July 19, 2002, Fecteau transmitted to Chibaro a\n\nvaluation as of June 30, 2002 (the fifth valuation).    Consent-to-\n\ndistribution forms were sent to the departing employees; Janeiro\n\ncompleted his and returned it on August 11, 2002.      The value of\n\nJaneiro's share, as of this valuation, was $456,644.    He received\n\nthis sum -- $195,036 less than the first valuation -- by late fall\n\nof 2002, nearly two years after the first valuation date of\n\nDecember 31, 2000.       He unsuccessfully sought to recover this\n\n$195,036 amount through administrative means.\n\n\n        1\n       Defendants emphasize one incident that occurred in the\nmeantime: in mid-January 2002, Janeiro directed Smith Barney, the\ncustodian of the plan assets, not to make further distributions.\nThe assets remained frozen until mid-April 2002. Whether or not\nthe freeze might in other circumstances have justified a delay in\ndistribution and even revaluation, it came too late here:\ndefendants' case founders at the very first revaluation.\n\n                                 -8-\n\f           Janeiro then sued the USPA, the two plans, and Chibaro.\n\nHe asserted four claims.          The first two, for benefits, see 29\n\nU.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B), and for equitable relief and restitution\n\nfor   breach    of    fiduciary   duty,    see   id.      §    1132(a)(3),       were\n\nessentially theories of recovery for the $195,036.                  The third was\n\nfor prejudgment interest, and the fourth was for attorneys' fees.\n\nC.         The District Court's Bench Ruling\n\n           At the end of a three-day bench trial, the district court\n\nmade findings of fact, most of which are summarized above.                        The\n\ncourt   further      determined   that    Chibaro   was       in   breach   of    his\n\nfiduciary duty in two ways:              First, Chibaro was aware as of\n\nDecember 30, 2000 that a substantial amount of the assets, having\n\nbeen claimed by the departing participants, would (or should)\n\nshortly be leaving the plan, but he failed to apprise the plan's\n\ninvestment advisor of this fact so that the advisor could liquidate\n\nand segregate sufficient plan assets. This failure meant that \"the\n\nassets remained invested in a mixture of stocks and bonds[,] which\n\nexposed the assets to be distributed to an unacceptable degree of\n\nmarket risk.\"     Second, Chibaro \"failed to take reasonable steps to\n\nensure that the [December 31, 2000] valuation was completed in a\n\ntimely manner\" by promptly transmitting the census to Fecteau and\n\ninsisting that Fecteau timely do its job.                 The six-month delay\n\nsimply was not justified.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\f            Taken together, these fiduciary breaches led to otherwise\n\navoidable losses: market losses traceable to the departing assets,\n\nwhich had not been liquidated and segregated, but rather had\n\nremained in risky investments. This particular category of losses,\n\nas distinct from the market losses traceable to the remaining\n\nassets, was \"due entirely and exclusively\" to Chibaro's fiduciary\n\nbreaches.   The court found that Janeiro was not at all responsible\n\nfor the breaches or the losses.           The court also declined to find\n\nthat Chibaro relied in good faith on the advice of professionals,\n\nnoting that, if anything, the evidence tended against such a\n\nfinding.\n\n            The district court then made the following conclusions of\n\nlaw:   First, Chibaro and the USPA were entitled to judgment as a\n\nmatter of law on the claim for damages based on a breach of\n\nfiduciary duty theory, because such a claim does not lie where, as\n\nhere, the suit is only on behalf of a claimant who has an available\n\nclaim for benefits.     See Varity Corp. v. Howe, 516 U.S. 489, 515\n\n(1996).    The court stressed that although Janeiro was not legally\n\nentitled to any relief on a breach of fiduciary duty theory,\n\nChibaro was in fact in breach of his fiduciary duty.\n\n            Second, the court held, Janeiro was entitled to prevail\n\non his benefits claim.        The court reasoned that Janeiro's account\n\nbalance    became   payable    on   the   valuation   date   following   his\n\ntermination -- that is, on December 31, 2000 -- and that Janeiro\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fhad timely elected such payment.             Further, the amount to which\n\nJaneiro was entitled was the value of his account on December 31,\n\n2000, unless some departure from that valuation date was justified.\n\nThe court agreed with defendants that § 6.2 of the Prototype Plan,\n\nwhich    permitted      the   plan   administrator    to   \"provide    for   an\n\nextraordinary adjustment date whenever market values of underlying\n\nassets have changed so much that it would be inequitable to do\n\notherwise,\" supplied a potential basis for departure. The ultimate\n\nquestion, therefore, was whether Chibaro, exercising the USPA's\n\nplan     administration       authority,     was     entitled     to   declare\n\nextraordinary adjustment dates on June 30, 2001 and on later dates.\n\n            In answering this question, the court first determined\n\nthe appropriate standard of review of defendants' application of\n\nthe plan's terms.       The court acknowledged that ordinarily it would\n\nreview only for abuse of discretion, but it held that in this case,\n\n\"Chibaro [was] operating under a conflict of interest that was so\n\nsevere . . . that it entitles his determinations\" to no deference.\n\nThe     court   cited    several     facts   supporting    this   conclusion.\n\n            First, Chibaro's judgment as to whether to employ an\n\nextraordinary valuation date was \"inevitably going to be affected\n\nby a concern . . . that he could be subject to suit for breach of\n\nfiduciary duty.\"         It was his failures to timely liquidate and\n\nsegregate plan assets, and to obtain a December 31, 2000 valuation\n\nthat produced avoidable losses -- that is, market losses traceable\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fto the departing assets, which should have been isolated from\n\nmarket risk and given to the departing participants. Using a later\n\nvaluation date (with a lower value) would put these avoidable\n\nlosses on the departing participants and thus reduce the risk that\n\nanyone remaining in the plan would sue for breach of fiduciary\n\nduty.       Second, the district court noted, Chibaro felt personal\n\nanimus toward the departing participants. By June of 2001, he \"was\n\nin a highly adversarial relationship with the departing employees,\"\n\nincluding the office manager, with whom he had a \"very hostile\n\nrelationship,\" and Janeiro, with whom he was then engaged in state-\n\ncourt    litigation.    It   was   Janeiro   who   had   commenced   that\n\nlitigation, and the district court found that \"there was animosity\n\nbetween them as a result of this litigation.\"       As mentioned above,\n\none of the other owners of the departing assets was Chibaro's ex-\n\nwife, claiming by way of a recent divorce.         The court found that\n\nChibaro \"did not want to make money for people who were leaving the\n\nplans,\" and that he \"harbor[ed] an animus against [them] sufficient\n\nto amount to conflict of interest.\"2\n\n\n\n\n     2\n       The district court did find that animus was not the motive\nin Chibaro's original fiduciary breaches of failing to promptly\nliquidate and segregate assets and to timely see that the December\n31, 2000 valuation was completed. But then losses began to mount\nas a result of the breaches, and Chibaro, in deciding whether to\nrevalue, began to be \"motivated in part\" by a desire not to, as he\nsaw it, \"enrich\" the departing participants. (Even then, the court\nfound, his primary purpose was simply to avoid losing his own\nmoney.)\n\n                                   -12-\n\f             Third, Chibaro's personal financial interests were set\n\ndirectly against those of the departing participants.             The court\n\nfound that because he owned 92% of the remaining assets (that is,\n\nof the 30% remaining), \"he would be the principal beneficiary\" of\n\na decision to revalue.\n\n             Reviewing the revaluation decisions de novo under the\n\nplan terms, the court ruled that Chibaro \"was not entitled to\n\ndeclare an extraordinary valuation date either as of June 30, 2001\n\nor [on] any of the subsequent dates.\"           The court described this as\n\na \"very difficult question.\"       It reasoned that even if Chibaro had\n\nnot been the principal beneficiary of revaluation, it still would\n\nhave been inappropriate to declare an extraordinary valuation date.\n\nThis   was   because   revaluing   did    not    \"equitably   allocate\"   the\n\navoidable losses caused by Chibaro's fiduciary breaches \"among all\n\nof the assets,\" but rather completely shifted all of those losses\n\n\"from the plan participants whose assets . . . remain in the plan,\n\n. . . to plan participants whose assets are leaving the plan.\"\n\n             The court cited several reasons for rejecting defendants'\n\nargument that the consequence of not revaluing -- namely, leaving\n\nall of the avoidable losses caused by Chibaro's fiduciary breaches\n\non the remaining participants -- justified their course of action.\n\nFirst, the market decrease between the first and second valuations,\n\nroughly 7.5% in six months, was \"not unusual at all,\" and causing\n\nthe remaining assets to bear the full amount of losses (including\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\flosses traceable to the departing assets) would not have been \"so\n\nunusual or substantial as to cause a failure to revalue to be\n\ninequitable.\" Second, revaluing delayed the distribution of funds.\n\nThird, shifting all of the avoidable losses caused by the breaches\n\nonto departing participants was not more fair, because \"[t]he\n\nfairest place to leave the consequence[] of the fiduciary breach\n\nunder these circumstances is where it lies\" as a result of the\n\nbreach -- that is, with the remaining plan assets.             The court\n\nexplained that the remaining participants injured by the breach\n\nhave recourse against, and can recover from, the administrator.\n\n          Lastly,   the   court   noted,   Chibaro   owned   92%   of   the\n\nremaining assets, meaning that the primary effect of revaluation\n\nwould be to shift losses from \"the wrongdoer\" to \"innocent parties\"\n\ndeparting the plan.       Not revaluing would simply have left the\n\nlosses from Chibaro's fiduciary breaches to fall almost entirely on\n\n\"the wrongdoer\" himself and would not have been inequitable.\n\n          The court thus found that the June 2001 revaluation was\n\ninappropriate, and that Janeiro had a right to his benefits as\n\nvalued as of December 31, 2000.          He was therefore entitled to\n\nrecover $195,036 -- the difference between the initial valuation\n\nand the amount that he had actually been paid to date.\n\n          The court then heard oral argument on attorneys' fees and\n\nprejudgment interest and, after determining that it had discretion\n\n\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\fas to both matters, denied both.3      As for attorneys' fees, the\n\ncourt cited the five-factor test described in Cook v. Liberty Life\n\nAssurance Co., 334 F.3d 122, 124 (1st Cir. 2003), and it determined\n\nthat each factor cut in favor of defendants: first, Chibaro did not\n\nact in bad faith, but instead believed that he was permitted under\n\nthe law to act as he did; second, the plan did not have deep\n\npockets, but rather had no more than $500,000 in assets, of which\n\nnearly $200,000 was already being awarded to Janeiro; third, an\n\naward was not necessary for deterrence purposes; fourth, an award\n\ncoming at the expense of the remaining plan participants, who\n\n(except for Chibaro) were innocent, would be inappropriate; and\n\nfifth, this was a close case.\n\n          As for prejudgment interest, the court emphasized its\n\nconcern about the effect such an award would have on the plan.   It\n\nadded that in its view, \"much the same factors that influence an\n\naward of attorney's fees here should apply in a pre-judgment\n\ninterest situation,\" and that those same factors indicated that an\n\naward of prejudgment interest was not warranted.\n\n                                II.\n\n             The Benefits Claim (Defendants' Appeal)\n\n          In reviewing a judgment following a bench trial, we\n\naccept the district court's findings of fact unless they are\n\n\n\n     3\n       The court did award post-judgment interest and costs to\nJaneiro.\n\n                                -15-\n\fclearly erroneous, keeping in mind that the district judge had the\n\nopportunity to assess the credibility of the witnesses.

We review conclusions of law de novo,\n\nid., and the parties are in agreement that this de novo review\n\nextends to the district court's ultimate decision as to which\n\nstandard of review applied to defendants' own decisions.\n\nA.              Standard of Review of Revaluation Decisions\n\n                The heart of defendants' argument is that the district\n\ncourt should not have applied de novo review to their decisions.\n\nThey raise two arguments based on the fact that the plan vested the\n\nUSPA, the plan administrator, with discretionary authority: First,\n\nthey say, the plan administrator did not operate under a conflict\n\nof interest, so the usual highly deferential standard of review\n\n\n\n       4\n      On appeal, defendants ignore and even contradict many of the\ndistrict court's adverse findings of fact. Defendants present no\ndeveloped argument in support of most of their version of the\nfacts. We therefore do not mention their version, except to the\nextent they have developed it on appeal by presenting something\napproaching a clear-error argument.\n\n                                       -16-\n\fshould apply.   Second, they argue, even the existence of a genuine\n\nconflict of interest should only have added some bite to the\n\nreview, without making it wholly nondeferential.         These arguments\n\nfail in light of the particular facts of the case.\n\n          Where the terms of an ERISA plan give discretion to the\n\nplan administrator to make benefits decisions and to construe the\n\nterms of the plan, the district court ordinarily should uphold such\n\ndeterminations by the administrator unless they constitute an abuse\n\nof discretion, or are arbitrary and capricious. See Wright v. R.R.\n\nDonnelley & Sons Co. Group Benefits Plan, 402 F.3d 67, 74 & n.3\n\n(1st Cir. 2005); Leahy v. Raytheon Co., 315 F.3d 11, 15 & n.3 (1st\n\nCir. 2002).     As this court has repeatedly made clear, however,\n\n\"[i]t is well settled that when a plan administrator labors under\n\na conflict of interest, courts may cede a diminished degree of\n\ndeference -- or no deference at all -- to the administrator's\n\ndeterminations.\"      Leahy, 315 F.3d at 16 (emphasis added); see also\n\nWright, 402 F.3d at 74 (quoting the same language from Leahy).\n\n          As    for   whether   there   was   a   conflict   of   interest,\n\ndefendants first attack the role Chibaro's 92% ownership of the\n\nremaining assets played in the district court's analysis.              They\n\ninvoke the rule that structural conflicts alone -- those arising\n\nfrom the administrator's or trustee's own financial interests --\n\nare not sufficient to abandon the normal highly deferential review.\n\nSee Wright, 402 F.3d at 75 (fact that plan administrator was also\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\fplan insurer did not, by itself, alter normal \"arbitrary and\n\ncapricious\" standard of review); Mahoney v. Bd. of Trs., 973 F.2d\n\n968, 971-73 (1st Cir. 1992) (applying \"arbitrary and capricious\"\n\nstandard    of     review    where    \"trustees   exercised   clearly   granted\n\ndiscretion to benefit one group of beneficiaries more than another,\n\nand the trustees benefited from that action as members of the much\n\nlarger, favored group\").           This rule makes sense because, where the\n\npotential conflict arises solely from the fact that any payment of\n\nbenefits will come at the decisionmaker's expense, market forces\n\ncan generally be expected to mitigate undue stinginess.               See Doyle\n\nv. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., 144 F.3d 181, 184 (1st Cir. 1998);\n\nWright, 402 F.3d at 75.\n\n            The district court's decision is entirely consistent with\n\nthe rule that a structural conflict by itself does not provide a\n\nbasis for departing from the usual standard of review.                The court\n\ndid   not   rely    solely    on     the   structural   conflict   arising   from\n\nChibaro's financial interest, but rather cited additional factors\n\npresent in this case.         These additional factors made it especially\n\nlikely that Chibaro's personal financial interest played a real\n\nrole in the decisions to revalue, and they showed in their own\n\nright that the decisions were actually \"improperly motivated.\"\n\nDoyle, 144 F.3d at 184; see also Wright, 402 F.3d at 75-78\n\n(considering various factors allegedly showing improper motivation,\n\nin addition to structural considerations, as possible bases of\n\n\n                                           -18-\n\fconflict of interest); Pari-Fasano v. ITT Hartford Life & Accident\n\nIns. Co., 230 F.3d 415, 419 (1st Cir. 2000) (distinguishing between\n\n\"potential\"   or   \"possible\"   conflicts     of   interest   arising   from\n\nstructural    considerations    and   cases    where   the    circumstances\n\nactually \"indicate[] an improper motivation\").\n\n            Defendants' attacks on the other two factors cited by the\n\ndistrict court are also unavailing.      As for the conflict based on\n\nChibaro's fear of litigation stemming from his earlier fiduciary\n\nbreaches, defendants claim that \"[t]here is simply no evidence that\n\nthe prospect of litigation factored into Dr. Chibaro's decision to\n\nrevalue.\"     They assert that there simply was no prospect of a\n\nlawsuit, and if there was, Chibaro was neither aware nor afraid of\n\nit.\n\n            First, defendants say, none of Chibaro's professional\n\nadvisors told him he was obliged to liquidate and segregate assets\n\nsufficient to pay the imminently departing plan participants, and\n\nthe first decision to revalue was based solely on the advice of\n\nprofessionals, not on the possibility of liability for any failure\n\nto liquidate and segregate.       But the district court found that\n\nChibaro failed to inform the investment advisor in the first place\n\nthat a significant exodus was imminent, found that it was Chibaro\n\nwho was \"determined to have\" a revaluation and who \"directed\" that\n\none occur, and expressly refused to find that he relied in good\n\nfaith on the advice of professionals.         The defense of good-faith\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\freliance on advice is not available to one who omits to disclose\n\nmaterial information to advisors or dictates imprudent outcomes to\n\nadvisors.5    Cf. United States v. Rice, 449 F.3d 887, 897 (8th Cir.\n\n2006) (defendant not entitled to advice-of-counsel defense where he\n\nneither \"fully disclosed all material facts to his attorney before\n\nseeking advice\" nor \"actually relied on his counsel's advice in the\n\ngood faith belief that his conduct was legal\").\n\n             Second, defendants argue, there was \"no evidence\" that\n\nChibaro feared liability stemming from the six-month delay in\n\ncompleting the first valuation.     They say that annual valuations\n\nwere generally completed in April because it took the USPA time to\n\ndetermine the amount of its contribution to the Profit Sharing\n\nPlan, and that several months passed after the USPA submitted the\n\ncensus form to Fecteau before Fecteau completed the valuation.\n\nTaking these points in reverse order, we note that the delay once\n\n\n\n     5\n       William Prizer, the investment advisor, testified that\nChibaro never told him when Chibaro expected to do a distribution,\nthat Prizer was given \"the clear understanding that this wasn't .\n. . going to happen any time soon,\" and that if Prizer had been\ntold there would \"be a payout date in December,\" he \"[a]bsolutely\"\nwould have advised that more plan assets be put into cash-like\ninvestments to minimize risk. We do not consider the claim, raised\nfor the first time at oral argument and without record citation,\nthat Prizer knew about the imminent departure of 70% of the assets\nbecause he was also Janeiro's personal investment advisor.\n     Thomas Fecteau, of the third-party administration firm,\ntestified that it was Chibaro's idea to revalue instead of paying\nthe departing participants based on the December 31, 2000\nvaluation, and indeed that Chibaro was \"adamant\" about revaluing.\nFecteau further testified that he did not make a recommendation\n\"one way or the other\" as to revaluation.\n\n                                 -20-\n\fthe census was in Fecteau's hands was attributable to Chibaro, who\n\nshould have ensured promptness on Fecteau's part; that an arguably\n\njustified delay as to one plan does not justify a delay as to the\n\nother plan; and that habitual delays in valuation of four months,\n\nnot conclusively shown to be justified to begin with, are hardly\n\nconclusive proof that a delay of half a year -- for work that\n\nshould      take    a    matter        of     hours   or       days   --   was      justified.\n\n              The evidence, in sum, supported a finding that Chibaro\n\nwas    at   fault       for   failure         to   timely      liquidate      and    segregate\n\nsufficient     assets         and      for    failure     to     ensure    that     the    first\n\nvaluation was timely completed. It was also plausible to find that\n\nthere was a prospect of litigation by the remaining participants\n\n(aside from Chibaro himself), who would bear the full costs of\n\nChibaro's     failures            if   no    revaluation       was    done.       And     it   was\n\nplausible to infer that Chibaro must have been aware of and feared\n\nthis prospect of litigation, and that this played a role in his\n\ndecision to revalue.\n\n              With respect to the district court's finding that Chibaro\n\nharbored animus toward the departing participants, defendants offer\n\nno contrary factual argument. They rely instead on a non sequitur:\n\nthat    Chibaro     had       a    fiduciary       duty     to   protect      the   financial\n\ninterests of all plan participants, including the remaining ones.\n\nThere is no doubt Chibaro had a legal duty to the remaining\n\n\n\n\n                                               -21-\n\fparticipants.6   But that duty did not necessarily motivate in whole\n\nor even in part his decision to revalue, nor did it make it\n\nfactually impossible for him to have been motivated by animus. The\n\ndistrict court expressly found Chibaro not credible with respect to\n\nhis claim that, in directing each revaluation, he was trying to\n\nprotect the other participants (aside from himself) remaining in\n\nthe plan.     Further, the relationship between Chibaro and the\n\ndeparting participants was plainly acrimonious, and we have no\n\nreason to doubt that there was animus and that it played a role in\n\nChibaro's decision to revalue.\n\n            Finally, we reject defendants' fallback argument that\n\neven if there was a conflict of interest, the district court should\n\nhave applied arbitrary and capricious review with \"bite\" but\n\nwithout ruling out all deference.       We have repeatedly stated that\n\n\"when a plan administrator labors under a conflict of interest,\n\ncourts may cede a diminished degree of deference -- or no deference\n\nat all -- to the administrator's determinations.\"7     Leahy, 315 F.3d\n\n\n     6\n       As we explain in the text, it is less clear than defendants\nthink that this duty required, or even permitted, revaluation here.\n     7\n       The decisions on which defendants rely do not mandate a\ndifferent approach. None involved a finding of a severe conflict\nbased partly on actual improper motivations such as animus. See\nFenton v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., 400 F.3d 83, 90 (1st\nCir. 2005) (arbitrary and capricious review proper in absence of\nshowing that \"adverse determination was improperly motivated\");\nLopes v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 332 F.3d 1, 4-5 & n.6 (1st Cir.\n2003) (refusal to apply de novo review proper where there was\nstructural conflict and evidence of improper motivation was \"not\nparticularly convincing\" and revealed \"nothing untoward\");\n\n                                 -22-\n\fat 16 (emphasis added); see also Wright, 402 F.3d at 74.\n\n            The district court's approach was consistent with the\n\nSupreme Court's statement that \"if a benefit plan gives discretion\n\nto an administrator or fiduciary who is operating under a conflict\n\nof interest, that conflict must be weighed as a 'facto[r] in\n\ndetermining whether there is an abuse of discretion.'\"                     Firestone\n\nTire & Rubber Co. v. Bruch, 489 U.S. 101, 115 (1989) (alteration in\n\noriginal) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 187 cmt. d\n\n(1959));    see   also    Wright,      402   F.3d    at   74    (\"In   applying    the\n\narbitrary and capricious standard . . . the existence of a conflict\n\nof interest on the part of the administrator is a factor which must\n\nbe considered.\").        In some cases, the conflict is so severe that\n\ngiving it sufficient weight as a \"factor\" (or applying the level of\n\n\"bite\"   necessary       to   account    for   the    severity      of    the   actual\n\nconflict)    requires         giving    no   deference         to   the   conflicted\n\ndecisionmaker.     Given the severe conflict of interest under which\n\nChibaro was laboring, the district court properly gave no deference\n\nto the decisions he made in exclusively exercising the USPA's plan\n\nadministration authority.\n\nB.          Correctness of Revaluation Decisions\n\n\nPari-Fasano, 230 F.3d at 419 (arbitrary and capricious review where\nthere was structural conflict but not actual improper motivation);\nDoyle, 144 F.3d at 184 (in case of structural conflict, applying\narbitrary and capricious review with \"more bite,\" and \"interpreting\n'more bite' as adhering to the arbitrary and capricious principle,\nwith special emphasis on reasonableness, but with the burden on the\nclaimant to show that the decision was improperly motivated\").\n\n                                        -23-\n\f           The defendants argue the belated revaluations were proper\n\nunder the provision allowing the administrator to \"provide for an\n\nextraordinary adjustment date whenever market values of underlying\n\nassets have changed so much that it would be inequitable to do\n\notherwise.\"      The district court did not err in finding that this\n\nprovision did not apply and that it provided no basis to deny the\n\nbenefits   sought.        Defendants     purport     to    justify     all    the\n\nrevaluations on the ground that they were \"necessary to ensure that\n\nthe market losses that occurred after December 31, 2000 were borne\n\nequally by all plan participants.\" For the exact reasons stated by\n\nthe district court, this is an inadequate explanation.\n\n           First, the district court found that the 7.5% market\n\ndecrease during the six months following December 31, 2000 was \"not\n\nunusual at all,\" and that not revaluing would not have put an\n\nespecially large burden on the remaining assets (the loss to the\n\nremaining assets would have been roughly 25%). Defendants have not\n\nshown that this essentially empirical analysis, in the context of\n\na plan provision for \"extraordinary\" adjustment dates, was wrong.\n\n           Second, the revaluations did distribute \"market losses\"\n\nequally among all plan participants, but they did not distribute\n\nthe losses attributable to Chibaro's fiduciary breaches equally\n\namong all participants.         The market losses that occurred after\n\nDecember   31,    2000,   to   the   extent   they   are   traceable    to    the\n\ndeparting assets, should not have occurred to begin with.                    Those\n\n\n                                      -24-\n\fassets should not have been in risky market investments after\n\nDecember 31, 2000, and the losses traceable to them were the direct\n\nresult   of    Chibaro's     fiduciary   breaches    in   failing      to   timely\n\nliquidate and segregate plan assets, and to obtain valuations. The\n\neffect of revaluation was to put all of the loss caused by these\n\nfiduciary breaches on the departing participants.               Keeping in mind\n\nthat the plan allowed for extraordinary revaluations only \"whenever\n\n. . . it would be inequitable to do otherwise,\" equity hardly\n\ndemanded      that    this   entire   loss    be    put   on    the    departing\n\nparticipants.8\n\n              Not revaluing would simply have left all of the avoidable\n\nlosses   due    to    Chibaro's   fiduciary   breaches     on    the   remaining\n\nparticipants.        Importantly, the vast majority (92%) of the assets\n\nthat would have been left to absorb the losses from Chibaro's\n\nfiduciary breaches belonged to Chibaro himself.            It would not have\n\nbeen inequitable for him to bear the brunt of the losses he\n\nwrongfully caused.9\n\n\n     8\n       Defendants characterize revaluation as necessary to prevent\nthe departing participants from \"obtaining a windfall\" at the\nexpense of the remaining participants. It is difficult to see how\nnot being forced to bear the entirety of losses that never should\nhave occurred in the first place, while the remaining participants\nbear none, can be labeled a \"windfall.\"\n     9\n       Defendants suggest that because the district court had ruled\nout a theory of recovery based on breach of fiduciary duty, it was\nsomehow improper, or an \"end-run around ERISA,\" to consider\nChibaro's   actual   fiduciary   breaches,   which   preceded   the\nrevaluations, in assessing the equities of revaluing.          This\nargument makes little sense, but as it is unsupported by any\n\n                                      -25-\n\f          Whatever the force of defendants' argument about the\n\nclause in the abstract, defendants acted as though it permitted\n\nunlimited retention of assets, keeping the assets of departing\n\nparticipants for nearly two years and performing a total of five\n\nvaluations.   The clause may not reasonably be read that way.\n\n                                  III.\n\n              Attorneys' Fees and Prejudgment Interest\n                     (Plaintiff's Cross-Appeal)\n\n          Janeiro's cross-appeal challenges the district court's\n\ndenial of attorneys' fees and prejudgment interest.\n\nA.

We review the\n\ndenial   of   attorneys'   fees   only   for   abuse   of   discretion,\n\n\"disturb[ing] such rulings only if the record persuades us that the\n\ntrial court 'indulged a serious lapse in judgment.'\"        Cottrill v.\n\nSparrow, Johnson & Ursillo, Inc., 100 F.3d 220, 223 (1st Cir. 1996)\n\n(quoting Texaco P.R., Inc. v. Dep't of Consumer Affairs, 60 F.3d\n\n867, 875 (1st Cir. 1995)).         We see no abuse of discretion.\n\n          We begin by noting that \"in an ERISA case, a prevailing\n\nplaintiff does not, merely by prevailing, create a presumption that\n\n\n\ncitations to authority, we simply deem it waived. We reject the\nclaim that even if the breaches could be considered, the district\ncourt \"placed undue emphasis\" on them and on Chibaro's ownership\ninterest in the remaining assets. The court's weighing of these\nfactors, along with others, was perfectly sensible.\n\n                                  -26-\n\fhe or she is entitled to a fee-shifting award.\"            Id. at 226.     This\n\nis an area of law that should be, and is, flexible.            Id. at 225-26.\n\n            Although     \"fee     awards      under    ERISA    are   wholly\n\ndiscretionary,\" this court has listed five factors that ordinarily\n\nshould guide the district court's analysis:\n\n            (1) the degree of culpability or bad faith\n            attributable to the losing party; (2) the\n            depth of the losing party's pocket, i.e., his\n            or her capacity to pay an award; (3) the\n            extent (if at all) to which such an award\n            would deter other persons acting under similar\n            circumstances; (4) the benefit (if any) that\n            the   successful    suit   confers   on   plan\n            participants or beneficiaries generally; and\n            (5) the relative merit of the parties'\n            positions.\n\nCottrill,   100   F.3d   at    225.    This   list    is   illustrative,   not\n\nexhaustive, id.; no single factor is dispositive; and indeed, not\n\nevery factor in the list must be considered in every case.            Twomey\n\nv. Delta Airlines Pilots Pension Plan, 328 F.3d 27, 33 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).\n\n            As for the first factor, the district court was not\n\nobliged to find that defendants acted with an especially high\n\ndegree of culpability.        It was plausible, in evaluating whether to\n\naward attorneys' fees, to find that Chibaro subjectively thought he\n\nwas entitled to administer the plan as he did.\n\n            Analyzing the second factor, the district court expressed\n\na legitimate concern that the plan's assets were quite modest and\n\n\n\n\n                                      -27-\n\fwere already subject to a benefits award comprising at least two-\n\nfifths, and perhaps as much as two-thirds, of the total assets.10\n\n           Janeiro adds that even though \"the district court ruled\n\nin favor of USPA and Dr. Chibaro as to Dr. Janeiro's claims against\n\nthem,\" Chibaro's and the USPA's assets should still be fair game\n\nfor an award of attorneys' fees, because they were the key players\n\nthrough which the two plans acted.     Janeiro cites no authority for\n\ntreating the USPA and Chibaro as \"losing parties\" for purposes of\n\nattorneys' fees on a benefits claim that succeeded only against the\n\nplans.11   In any event, no matter whose and how plentiful were the\n\nassets available for an award of attorneys' fees, this factor would\n\nmean little.   \"An inability to afford attorneys' fees may counsel\n\n\n     10\n       Janeiro argues that plan assets financed Chibaro's defense,\nand that Chibaro, as the primary owner of the remaining assets,\nwould bear the brunt of a fee award to Janeiro. On appeal, Chibaro\nsays he bore (with his plan assets) the attorneys' fees and costs\nof defending this case.        If any payment was improper, an\nappropriate party may pursue the matter.\n     11\n       The breach of fiduciary duty claim was asserted only against\nChibaro and the USPA.      The claims for benefits, prejudgment\ninterest, and attorneys' fees did not specify defendants, although\nthe first claim did assert a right to sue \"the Plans.\"        It is\napparent from various pretrial filings that the parties understood\nthese three claims to be against all the defendants, including\nChibaro individually. Moreover, the judgment for Janeiro did not\nspecify which defendants were liable.      At trial, however, the\ndistrict court said, in disposing of the breach of fiduciary duty\nclaim, \"I do not see how [Janeiro] can maintain any claim against\n. . . Chibaro individually. I don't see how he can maintain claims\nagainst USPA in [its] capacity as a plan administrator. Instead,\nhis remaining claim is a claim for benefits which is properly\nasserted against the plans . . . .\" The court later reiterated\nthat Janeiro was entitled to relief only against the two plans.\nJaneiro does not develop any contrary argument on appeal.\n\n                                -28-\n\fagainst an award, but the capacity to pay, by itself, does not\n\njustify an award.\"   Cottrill, 100 F.3d at 227 (citation omitted).\n\n          Turning    to   the    third    factor,    the     district     court\n\ndetermined that the benefits award itself was large enough to deter\n\nsimilar misconduct, and that an award of attorneys' fees was\n\nunnecessary for that purpose.       Janeiro argues that denying fees\n\nsends the wrong message to the \"ERISA community\" and invites plan\n\nadministrators to \"play fast and loose\" with plan terms and with\n\ndeparting participants' money.       The district court, which viewed\n\nthe evidence in this case first-hand, disagreed, and we have no\n\nbasis for rejecting its conclusion.        See id.\n\n          The fourth factor is \"the benefit (if any) that the\n\nsuccessful suit confers on plan participants or beneficiaries\n\ngenerally.\"    Id.   at   225.     Nothing   in     the    district     court's\n\nconsideration of this factor required a different result.\n\n          Fifth and finally, the district court stressed that \"this\n\n[was] a close case using a de novo standard.\"              Indeed, the judge\n\nstated, it was one of the most difficult cases he had ever decided.\n\nCf. id. at 227 (\"The very fact that an experienced trial judge\n\noriginally found in the defendants' favor argues for a finding that\n\nthe defendants had a reasonable basis for [their position], even\n\nthough this court ultimately ruled against them.\").             The standard\n\nof review to apply to defendants' decision to revalue was not an\n\n\n\n\n                                   -29-\n\fopen-and-shut question, nor was the correctness of the decision\n\nitself.\n\n                The   district      court,    in     short,     did    not     abuse   its\n\ndiscretion in denying Janeiro attorneys' fees.\n\nB.              Prejudgment Interest\n\n                Janeiro seeks prejudgment interest on the $195,036 he won\n\nin the district court, and on the $456,644 he was paid in the fall\n\nof 2002, to the extent that payment was also late.                        The district\n\ncourt        denied   any   award,    saying       that   it   \"reach[ed]       the    same\n\nconclusion\" as it reached with respect to attorneys' fees, for\n\n\"much        the   same\"    reasons.         The    court      did    single    out    one\n\nconsideration -- the effect an award of interest would have on the\n\nplan -- but did not otherwise elaborate.\n\n                Although there is no specific statutory provision for\n\nprejudgment        interest    in    most    ERISA    cases,     such    awards,       like\n\nattorneys' fees, are \"available, but not obligatory.\"                        Id. at 223.\n\nWe review the denial of prejudgment interest in ERISA cases only\n\nfor abuse of discretion.12            Id.\n\n                Janeiro was wrongfully deprived of the use of money for\n\na substantial length of time, and prejudgment interest would make\n\n\n\n        12\n        Janeiro has not offered any developed argument that this\ncourt should adopt (or has already adopted) a presumption in favor\nof prejudgment interest. See Biggins v. Hazen Paper Co., 953 F.2d\n1405, 1427 (1st Cir. 1992) (stating, where prejudgment interest was\nawarded, that \"[w]e need not go [as far as adopting a presumption]\nat this time\"), vacated on other grounds, 507 U.S. 604 (1993).\n\n                                            -30-\n\fhim whole as to that harm, see West Virginia v. United States, 479\n\nU.S. 305, 310 n.2 (1987), which would \"serve[] ERISA's remedial\n\nobjectives,\" Cottrill, 100 F.3d at 224.        But Congress's desire to\n\nprotect employee benefits is not ERISA's only purpose.                  Varity\n\nCorp., 516 U.S. at 497.       Further, prejudgment interest \"is not\n\ngranted 'according to a rigid theory of compensation for money\n\nwithheld, but is given in response to considerations of fairness.'\"\n\nWhitfield   v.   Lindemann,   853   F.2d   1298,   1306   (5th   Cir.   1988)\n\n(quoting Blau v. Lehman, 368 U.S. 403, 414 (1962)); see also Blau,\n\n368 U.S. at 414 (interest \"is denied when its exaction would be\n\ninequitable\" (internal quotation mark omitted) (quoting Bd. of\n\nComm'rs v. United States, 308 U.S. 343, 352 (1939))).\n\n            Here, the district court was, first, concerned about how\n\nan award of interest would affect the plan.           The benefits claim\n\nitself was quite substantial in light of the total plan assets.\n\nCf. Goya Foods, Inc. v. Wallack Mgmt. Co., 290 F.3d 63, 80 (1st\n\nCir. 2002) (district court free to \"decide to leave well enough\n\nalone\" where underlying monetary sanction for contempt was itself\n\n\"a substantial amount of money\").           The court also thought the\n\nordinary attorneys' fees factors pertinent.          These factors might\n\nnot be automatically applicable in all prejudgment interest cases.\n\nBut Janeiro does not argue that these factors were impermissible\n\n\n\n\n                                    -31-\n\fconsiderations,13 and, as explained above in the attorneys' fees\n\ndiscussion, we see nothing wrong with how the court assessed them\n\nin light of the facts of this case.            The district court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in denying an award of prejudgment interest.\n\n                                     IV.\n\n                                  Conclusion\n\n              The district court's analysis of this case was careful\n\nand   fair.     Its   judgment,   awarding     plaintiff   $195,036   on   the\n\nbenefits claim and denying him an award of attorneys' fees and\n\nprejudgment interest, is affirmed.           The parties shall bear their\n\nown costs and attorneys' fees on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n      13\n       Indeed, Janeiro even relies on the deterrence factor --\nwhich, as already stated, the district court viewed as adequately\nserved by the large benefits award.\n\n                                     -32-\n\f",

This is a case arising under the\n\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 1001-1461.       After a bench trial, plaintiff John J. Janeiro, Jr.\n\nwas awarded $195,036 in benefits, a sum that the district court\n\nheld had been wrongfully withheld from him by two retirement plans.\n\nThe plans were administered by the Urological Surgery Professional\n\nAssociation    (USPA),      and   their   primary    trustee     was    Edward    A.\n\nChibaro, Janeiro's former business partner.\n\n            On appeal, the main issue is what standard of review the\n\ndistrict    court    should   have   applied    to    the   benefits     claim   in\n\nevaluating the defendants' decisionmaking.              The standard varies,\n\ndepending on whether there was a conflict of interest.                  Defendants\n\nargue that they were entitled to greater deference from the court\n\nas to their repeated revaluations of, and delay in paying, the\n\namount due to Janeiro.        We disagree.     On these facts, the district\n\ncourt properly engaged in plenary review, in light of the conflict\n\nof interest of the plans' trustee, Chibaro.                 It then correctly\n\nfound for plaintiff on his benefits claim.\n\n            For     his   part,   Janeiro    has     cross-appealed,      seeking\n\nattorneys'    fees    and   prejudgment     interest.       We   hold    that    the\n\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in denying these\n\nrequests.    In sum, both the appeal and the cross-appeal fail.

Our summary is based\n\nlargely upon the district court's factual findings, in which we see\n\nno clear error.\n\nA.         The Plans\n\n           For over a decade, Janeiro was an employee of the USPA,\n\na medical practice.     He and Chibaro, both doctors, were co-owners\n\nof the practice.       The USPA was, and still is, the sponsor and\n\nadministrator of two pension benefit plans governed by ERISA: the\n\nMoney Purchase Pension Plan and Trust, and the Profit Sharing Plan\n\nand Trust.   Janeiro participated in both plans.\n\n           The Money Purchase Plan was funded by contributions from\n\nemployees' salaries, and the Profit Sharing Plan was funded by a\n\ncombination of employee and employer contributions.          Both plans\n\nwere   defined   contribution,   pooled    asset   plans.   Both   plans\n\nconsisted of several documents -- a Prototype Plan, an Adoption\n\nAgreement, a Trust Agreement, and a Summary Plan Description --\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fthat are, in all relevant respects, identical for each plan.\n\n              The pertinent terms created by the documents are these:\n\nFirst, § B.5.1 of each plan's Adoption Agreement provides that\n\n\"[t]here are no restrictions other than those of Article 10 in the\n\n[Prototype Plan] on when, following termination of employment, a\n\nparticipant may begin receiving benefits.\"                   Article 10 of the\n\nPrototype Plan, in turn, provides in § 10.1(b) that \"[u]nless a\n\nparticipant elects otherwise . . . , benefit distribution occurs\n\n(or begins) no later than the sixtieth day following the end of the\n\nplan   year    in    which    .    .   .   [the    participant]    terminates   his\n\nemployment with the employer.\" No other provision of Article 10 is\n\npertinent here.\n\n              Section B.5.1 of each plan's Adoption Agreement provides\n\nthat \"[w]hen an account balance becomes payable, it is paid in a\n\nlump   sum     at    the     valuation      date     following    the    occurrence\n\nprecipitating the disbursement.\" Under § B.4.1, \"[v]aluation dates\n\noccur at the end of each plan period.\"                The \"plan period\" was the\n\nsame as the \"plan year\": the calendar year, ending on the last day\n\nof December.\n\n              Section 6.2 of the Prototype Plan provides: \"Accounts are\n\nadjusted      to    reflect       investment      changes   on    each   adjustment\n\ndate. . . . Each valuation date is an adjustment date.                    The plan\n\nadministrator may also provide for an extraordinary adjustment date\n\n\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fwhenever market values of underlying assets have changed so much\n\nthat it would be inequitable to do otherwise.\"\n\n              Finally, under § 21.1 of the Prototype Plan, \"[t]he\n\nprincipal      employer       is     the     plan     administrator\"        and     \"has\n\ndiscretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits and\n\nto construe the terms of the plan.\"\n\n              This lawsuit concerns benefits under both plans.                      For\n\nconvenience, we refer to both as \"the plan,\" the usage adopted by\n\nthe district court.\n\n              Chibaro was listed on the plan as the individual trustee.\n\nAlthough Janeiro was named co-trustee in 1999 and signed some\n\ndocuments in that capacity, the district court found that he \"was\n\na   trustee    in    name   only,\"    and     that    Chibaro     was   the   one   who\n\n\"exclusively exercised\" both the responsibilities of trustee and\n\nthe   USPA's        responsibilities         of    plan     administration.          \"In\n\nparticular,\"        the   court     found,    \"it     was   Dr.   Chibaro     who   was\n\nexclusively responsible for interactions with both the plan's\n\ninvestment      advisor       and     the         third[-]party     administrator.\"\n\n              The    plan's    third-party          administrator       was   Fecteau\n\nAssociates, Inc. (\"Fecteau\"). Fecteau handled the annual valuation\n\nof plan assets.        It generated this information using a census form\n\nit sent to the USPA every December or January; a statement,\n\nobtained from the plan's investment advisor, of the value of the\n\nassets in the plan as of December 31; and other information,\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\fconcerning developments such as deposits and withdrawals, obtained\n\nfrom the USPA during the ordinary course of the year.         The court\n\nfound that it took the USPA roughly two hours to complete the\n\ncensus, and that it took five to ten hours for Fecteau to complete\n\nthe valuation once it had all the information.\n\nB.        The Business Breakup and the Benefits Dispute\n\n          In July of 2000, Janeiro gave notice that he intended to\n\nleave the USPA.    Thereafter, the relationship between Janeiro and\n\nChibaro was, in the district court's words, \"cold and at times very\n\ncontentious.\"      In   October   of   2000,   Janeiro   terminated   his\n\nemployment.     The next valuation date, which would apply in the\n\nordinary course, was December 31, 2000.\n\n          The district court found that both before and after\n\nDecember 31, 2000, Janeiro \"clearly and repeatedly communicated his\n\nintention to Dr. Chibaro . . . to withdraw his plan assets as soon\n\nas they could be withdrawn.\" In addition, several other terminated\n\nemployees and Chibaro's ex-wife, claiming by way of a recent\n\ndivorce, sought to obtain their share of assets as of the December\n\n31, 2000 valuation date.    In all, Chibaro knew that as of that date\n\nroughly 70% of the plan's assets would be departing.         Of the 30%\n\nremaining, 92% belonged to Chibaro.\n\n          The district court further found that the USPA had\n\nFecteau's 2000 annual census form in early January of 2001, but did\n\nnot complete and return it to Fecteau until March 12, 2001.\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fFecteau completed the valuation for December 31, 2000 (the first\n\nvaluation) and transmitted it to Chibaro by letter dated June 19,\n\n2001.   Janeiro's share of assets as of December 31, 2000 was valued\n\nat $651,680.\n\n           Importantly, between December of 2000 and June of 2001,\n\nthe market value of the plan assets declined.    The district court\n\nfound that Chibaro \"became concerned because . . . he didn't want\n\nto make money for other people that were leaving the plan, and in\n\neffect if Dr. Janeiro were to be paid the valuation as of December\n\n31, 2000, he would receive a greater percentage of the plan assets\n\nthan he would be entitled to if a new valuation was conducted.\"\n\nChibaro, who \"was determined to have the assets revalued,\" directed\n\nFecteau to revalue the assets, this time as of June 30, 2001 (the\n\nsecond valuation).     Fecteau did so, conveying the results to\n\nChibaro on August 10, 2001.   This time, Janeiro's share was valued\n\nat $603,052.   As the district court explained, the effect of the\n\nrevaluation \"was to transfer a loss that otherwise would have been\n\nborn[e] by the parties whose assets remained in the plan to the\n\nparties who were leaving.\"\n\n           At some point after August 10 and before September 11,\n\n2001, consent-to-distribution forms were distributed to Janeiro and\n\nthe other claimants.      Janeiro returned his completed form on\n\nSeptember 17, 2001. By then, the market had further declined, most\n\nnotably after September 11, 2001.      Chibaro had Fecteau perform\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fanother revaluation, this time as of October 31, 2001 (the third\n\nvaluation); the results were communicated to him on November 5,\n\n2001.       He did not notify the terminated employees about this\n\nrevaluation until November 30, and he did not provide them with\n\nconsent-to-distribution forms (which would have specified the value\n\nof their shares).\n\n             December 31, 2001 was the end of the plan year, and so\n\nwas a valuation date.    The valuation as of December 31, 2001 (the\n\nfourth valuation) was transmitted to Chibaro on April 30, 2002.1\n\nIn April of 2002, consent-to-distribution forms were distributed,\n\nbut this time Janeiro did not sign or return his.\n\n             On July 19, 2002, Fecteau transmitted to Chibaro a\n\nvaluation as of June 30, 2002 (the fifth valuation).    Consent-to-\n\ndistribution forms were sent to the departing employees; Janeiro\n\ncompleted his and returned it on August 11, 2002.      The value of\n\nJaneiro's share, as of this valuation, was $456,644.    He received\n\nthis sum -- $195,036 less than the first valuation -- by late fall\n\nof 2002, nearly two years after the first valuation date of\n\nDecember 31, 2000.       He unsuccessfully sought to recover this\n\n$195,036 amount through administrative means.\n\n\n        1\n       Defendants emphasize one incident that occurred in the\nmeantime: in mid-January 2002, Janeiro directed Smith Barney, the\ncustodian of the plan assets, not to make further distributions.\nThe assets remained frozen until mid-April 2002. Whether or not\nthe freeze might in other circumstances have justified a delay in\ndistribution and even revaluation, it came too late here:\ndefendants' case founders at the very first revaluation.\n\n                                 -8-\n\f           Janeiro then sued the USPA, the two plans, and Chibaro.\n\nHe asserted four claims.          The first two, for benefits, see 29\n\nU.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B), and for equitable relief and restitution\n\nfor   breach    of    fiduciary   duty,    see   id.      §    1132(a)(3),       were\n\nessentially theories of recovery for the $195,036.                  The third was\n\nfor prejudgment interest, and the fourth was for attorneys' fees.\n\nC.         The District Court's Bench Ruling\n\n           At the end of a three-day bench trial, the district court\n\nmade findings of fact, most of which are summarized above.                        The\n\ncourt   further      determined   that    Chibaro   was       in   breach   of    his\n\nfiduciary duty in two ways:              First, Chibaro was aware as of\n\nDecember 30, 2000 that a substantial amount of the assets, having\n\nbeen claimed by the departing participants, would (or should)\n\nshortly be leaving the plan, but he failed to apprise the plan's\n\ninvestment advisor of this fact so that the advisor could liquidate\n\nand segregate sufficient plan assets. This failure meant that \"the\n\nassets remained invested in a mixture of stocks and bonds[,] which\n\nexposed the assets to be distributed to an unacceptable degree of\n\nmarket risk.\"     Second, Chibaro \"failed to take reasonable steps to\n\nensure that the [December 31, 2000] valuation was completed in a\n\ntimely manner\" by promptly transmitting the census to Fecteau and\n\ninsisting that Fecteau timely do its job.                 The six-month delay\n\nsimply was not justified.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\f            Taken together, these fiduciary breaches led to otherwise\n\navoidable losses: market losses traceable to the departing assets,\n\nwhich had not been liquidated and segregated, but rather had\n\nremained in risky investments. This particular category of losses,\n\nas distinct from the market losses traceable to the remaining\n\nassets, was \"due entirely and exclusively\" to Chibaro's fiduciary\n\nbreaches.   The court found that Janeiro was not at all responsible\n\nfor the breaches or the losses.           The court also declined to find\n\nthat Chibaro relied in good faith on the advice of professionals,\n\nnoting that, if anything, the evidence tended against such a\n\nfinding.\n\n            The district court then made the following conclusions of\n\nlaw:   First, Chibaro and the USPA were entitled to judgment as a\n\nmatter of law on the claim for damages based on a breach of\n\nfiduciary duty theory, because such a claim does not lie where, as\n\nhere, the suit is only on behalf of a claimant who has an available\n\nclaim for benefits.     See Varity Corp. v. Howe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118008\"><a href=\"/opinion/118008/varity-corp-v-howe/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">489</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 515\n\n(1996).    The court stressed that although Janeiro was not legally\n\nentitled to any relief on a breach of fiduciary duty theory,\n\nChibaro was in fact in breach of his fiduciary duty.\n\n            Second, the court held, Janeiro was entitled to prevail\n\non his benefits claim.        The court reasoned that Janeiro's account\n\nbalance    became   payable    on   the   valuation   date   following   his\n\ntermination -- that is, on December 31, 2000 -- and that Janeiro\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fhad timely elected such payment.             Further, the amount to which\n\nJaneiro was entitled was the value of his account on December 31,\n\n2000, unless some departure from that valuation date was justified.\n\nThe court agreed with defendants that § 6.2 of the Prototype Plan,\n\nwhich    permitted      the   plan   administrator    to   \"provide    for   an\n\nextraordinary adjustment date whenever market values of underlying\n\nassets have changed so much that it would be inequitable to do\n\notherwise,\" supplied a potential basis for departure. The ultimate\n\nquestion, therefore, was whether Chibaro, exercising the USPA's\n\nplan     administration       authority,     was     entitled     to   declare\n\nextraordinary adjustment dates on June 30, 2001 and on later dates.\n\n            In answering this question, the court first determined\n\nthe appropriate standard of review of defendants' application of\n\nthe plan's terms.       The court acknowledged that ordinarily it would\n\nreview only for abuse of discretion, but it held that in this case,\n\n\"Chibaro [was] operating under a conflict of interest that was so\n\nsevere . . . that it entitles his determinations\" to no deference.\n\nThe     court   cited    several     facts   supporting    this   conclusion.\n\n            First, Chibaro's judgment as to whether to employ an\n\nextraordinary valuation date was \"inevitably going to be affected\n\nby a concern . . . that he could be subject to suit for breach of\n\nfiduciary duty.\"         It was his failures to timely liquidate and\n\nsegregate plan assets, and to obtain a December 31, 2000 valuation\n\nthat produced avoidable losses -- that is, market losses traceable\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fto the departing assets, which should have been isolated from\n\nmarket risk and given to the departing participants. Using a later\n\nvaluation date (with a lower value) would put these avoidable\n\nlosses on the departing participants and thus reduce the risk that\n\nanyone remaining in the plan would sue for breach of fiduciary\n\nduty.       Second, the district court noted, Chibaro felt personal\n\nanimus toward the departing participants. By June of 2001, he \"was\n\nin a highly adversarial relationship with the departing employees,\"\n\nincluding the office manager, with whom he had a \"very hostile\n\nrelationship,\" and Janeiro, with whom he was then engaged in state-\n\ncourt    litigation.    It   was   Janeiro   who   had   commenced   that\n\nlitigation, and the district court found that \"there was animosity\n\nbetween them as a result of this litigation.\"       As mentioned above,\n\none of the other owners of the departing assets was Chibaro's ex-\n\nwife, claiming by way of a recent divorce.         The court found that\n\nChibaro \"did not want to make money for people who were leaving the\n\nplans,\" and that he \"harbor[ed] an animus against [them] sufficient\n\nto amount to conflict of interest.\"2\n\n\n\n\n     2\n       The district court did find that animus was not the motive\nin Chibaro's original fiduciary breaches of failing to promptly\nliquidate and segregate assets and to timely see that the December\n31, 2000 valuation was completed. But then losses began to mount\nas a result of the breaches, and Chibaro, in deciding whether to\nrevalue, began to be \"motivated in part\" by a desire not to, as he\nsaw it, \"enrich\" the departing participants. (Even then, the court\nfound, his primary purpose was simply to avoid losing his own\nmoney.)\n\n                                   -12-\n\f             Third, Chibaro's personal financial interests were set\n\ndirectly against those of the departing participants.             The court\n\nfound that because he owned 92% of the remaining assets (that is,\n\nof the 30% remaining), \"he would be the principal beneficiary\" of\n\na decision to revalue.\n\n             Reviewing the revaluation decisions de novo under the\n\nplan terms, the court ruled that Chibaro \"was not entitled to\n\ndeclare an extraordinary valuation date either as of June 30, 2001\n\nor [on] any of the subsequent dates.\"           The court described this as\n\na \"very difficult question.\"       It reasoned that even if Chibaro had\n\nnot been the principal beneficiary of revaluation, it still would\n\nhave been inappropriate to declare an extraordinary valuation date.\n\nThis   was   because   revaluing   did    not    \"equitably   allocate\"   the\n\navoidable losses caused by Chibaro's fiduciary breaches \"among all\n\nof the assets,\" but rather completely shifted all of those losses\n\n\"from the plan participants whose assets . . . remain in the plan,\n\n. . . to plan participants whose assets are leaving the plan.\"\n\n             The court cited several reasons for rejecting defendants'\n\nargument that the consequence of not revaluing -- namely, leaving\n\nall of the avoidable losses caused by Chibaro's fiduciary breaches\n\non the remaining participants -- justified their course of action.\n\nFirst, the market decrease between the first and second valuations,\n\nroughly 7.5% in six months, was \"not unusual at all,\" and causing\n\nthe remaining assets to bear the full amount of losses (including\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\flosses traceable to the departing assets) would not have been \"so\n\nunusual or substantial as to cause a failure to revalue to be\n\ninequitable.\" Second, revaluing delayed the distribution of funds.\n\nThird, shifting all of the avoidable losses caused by the breaches\n\nonto departing participants was not more fair, because \"[t]he\n\nfairest place to leave the consequence[] of the fiduciary breach\n\nunder these circumstances is where it lies\" as a result of the\n\nbreach -- that is, with the remaining plan assets.             The court\n\nexplained that the remaining participants injured by the breach\n\nhave recourse against, and can recover from, the administrator.\n\n          Lastly,   the   court   noted,   Chibaro   owned   92%   of   the\n\nremaining assets, meaning that the primary effect of revaluation\n\nwould be to shift losses from \"the wrongdoer\" to \"innocent parties\"\n\ndeparting the plan.       Not revaluing would simply have left the\n\nlosses from Chibaro's fiduciary breaches to fall almost entirely on\n\n\"the wrongdoer\" himself and would not have been inequitable.\n\n          The court thus found that the June 2001 revaluation was\n\ninappropriate, and that Janeiro had a right to his benefits as\n\nvalued as of December 31, 2000.          He was therefore entitled to\n\nrecover $195,036 -- the difference between the initial valuation\n\nand the amount that he had actually been paid to date.\n\n          The court then heard oral argument on attorneys' fees and\n\nprejudgment interest and, after determining that it had discretion\n\n\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\fas to both matters, denied both.3      As for attorneys' fees, the\n\ncourt cited the five-factor test described in Cook v.

It\n\nadded that in its view, \"much the same factors that influence an\n\naward of attorney's fees here should apply in a pre-judgment\n\ninterest situation,\" and that those same factors indicated that an\n\naward of prejudgment interest was not warranted.\n\n                                II.\n\n             The Benefits Claim (Defendants' Appeal)\n\n          In reviewing a judgment following a bench trial, we\n\naccept the district court's findings of fact unless they are\n\n\n\n     3\n       The court did award post-judgment interest and costs to\nJaneiro.\n\n                                -15-\n\fclearly erroneous, keeping in mind that the district judge had the\n\nopportunity to assess the credibility of the witnesses.

Standard of Review of Revaluation Decisions\n\n                The heart of defendants' argument is that the district\n\ncourt should not have applied de novo review to their decisions.\n\nThey raise two arguments based on the fact that the plan vested the\n\nUSPA, the plan administrator, with discretionary authority: First,\n\nthey say, the plan administrator did not operate under a conflict\n\nof interest, so the usual highly deferential standard of review\n\n\n\n       4\n      On appeal, defendants ignore and even contradict many of the\ndistrict court's adverse findings of fact.

Second, they argue, even the existence of a genuine\n\nconflict of interest should only have added some bite to the\n\nreview, without making it wholly nondeferential.         These arguments\n\nfail in light of the particular facts of the case.\n\n          Where the terms of an ERISA plan give discretion to the\n\nplan administrator to make benefits decisions and to construe the\n\nterms of the plan, the district court ordinarily should uphold such\n\ndeterminations by the administrator unless they constitute an abuse\n\nof discretion, or are arbitrary and capricious.

As for the conflict based on\n\nChibaro's fear of litigation stemming from his earlier fiduciary\n\nbreaches, defendants claim that \"[t]here is simply no evidence that\n\nthe prospect of litigation factored into Dr. Chibaro's decision to\n\nrevalue.\"     They assert that there simply was no prospect of a\n\nlawsuit, and if there was, Chibaro was neither aware nor afraid of\n\nit.\n\n            First, defendants say, none of Chibaro's professional\n\nadvisors told him he was obliged to liquidate and segregate assets\n\nsufficient to pay the imminently departing plan participants, and\n\nthe first decision to revalue was based solely on the advice of\n\nprofessionals, not on the possibility of liability for any failure\n\nto liquidate and segregate.       But the district court found that\n\nChibaro failed to inform the investment advisor in the first place\n\nthat a significant exodus was imminent, found that it was Chibaro\n\nwho was \"determined to have\" a revaluation and who \"directed\" that\n\none occur, and expressly refused to find that he relied in good\n\nfaith on the advice of professionals.

They say that annual valuations\n\nwere generally completed in April because it took the USPA time to\n\ndetermine the amount of its contribution to the Profit Sharing\n\nPlan, and that several months passed after the USPA submitted the\n\ncensus form to Fecteau before Fecteau completed the valuation.\n\nTaking these points in reverse order, we note that the delay once\n\n\n\n     5\n       William Prizer, the investment advisor, testified that\nChibaro never told him when Chibaro expected to do a distribution,\nthat Prizer was given \"the clear understanding that this wasn't .\n. . going to happen any time soon,\" and that if Prizer had been\ntold there would \"be a payout date in December,\" he \"[a]bsolutely\"\nwould have advised that more plan assets be put into cash-like\ninvestments to minimize risk. We do not consider the claim, raised\nfor the first time at oral argument and without record citation,\nthat Prizer knew about the imminent departure of 70% of the assets\nbecause he was also Janeiro's personal investment advisor.\n     Thomas Fecteau, of the third-party administration firm,\ntestified that it was Chibaro's idea to revalue instead of paying\nthe departing participants based on the December 31, 2000\nvaluation, and indeed that Chibaro was \"adamant\" about revaluing.\nFecteau further testified that he did not make a recommendation\n\"one way or the other\" as to revaluation.\n\n                                 -20-\n\fthe census was in Fecteau's hands was attributable to Chibaro, who\n\nshould have ensured promptness on Fecteau's part; that an arguably\n\njustified delay as to one plan does not justify a delay as to the\n\nother plan; and that habitual delays in valuation of four months,\n\nnot conclusively shown to be justified to begin with, are hardly\n\nconclusive proof that a delay of half a year -- for work that\n\nshould      take    a    matter        of     hours   or       days   --   was      justified.\n\n              The evidence, in sum, supported a finding that Chibaro\n\nwas    at   fault       for   failure         to   timely      liquidate      and    segregate\n\nsufficient     assets         and      for    failure     to     ensure    that     the    first\n\nvaluation was timely completed. It was also plausible to find that\n\nthere was a prospect of litigation by the remaining participants\n\n(aside from Chibaro himself), who would bear the full costs of\n\nChibaro's     failures            if   no    revaluation       was    done.       And     it   was\n\nplausible to infer that Chibaro must have been aware of and feared\n\nthis prospect of litigation, and that this played a role in his\n\ndecision to revalue.\n\n              With respect to the district court's finding that Chibaro\n\nharbored animus toward the departing participants, defendants offer\n\nno contrary factual argument. They rely instead on a non sequitur:\n\nthat    Chibaro     had       a    fiduciary       duty     to   protect      the   financial\n\ninterests of all plan participants, including the remaining ones.\n\nThere is no doubt Chibaro had a legal duty to the remaining\n\n\n\n\n                                               -21-\n\fparticipants.6   But that duty did not necessarily motivate in whole\n\nor even in part his decision to revalue, nor did it make it\n\nfactually impossible for him to have been motivated by animus. The\n\ndistrict court expressly found Chibaro not credible with respect to\n\nhis claim that, in directing each revaluation, he was trying to\n\nprotect the other participants (aside from himself) remaining in\n\nthe plan.     Further, the relationship between Chibaro and the\n\ndeparting participants was plainly acrimonious, and we have no\n\nreason to doubt that there was animus and that it played a role in\n\nChibaro's decision to revalue.\n\n            Finally, we reject defendants' fallback argument that\n\neven if there was a conflict of interest, the district court should\n\nhave applied arbitrary and capricious review with \"bite\" but\n\nwithout ruling out all deference.       We have repeatedly stated that\n\n\"when a plan administrator labors under a conflict of interest,\n\ncourts may cede a diminished degree of deference -- or no deference\n\nat all -- to the administrator's determinations.\"7     Leahy, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">315</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n\n     <span class=\"page\">6</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n       As we explain in the text, it is less clear than defendants\nthink that this duty required, or even permitted, revaluation here.\n     7\n       The decisions on which defendants rely do not mandate a\ndifferent approach.

Defendants     purport     to    justify     all    the\n\nrevaluations on the ground that they were \"necessary to ensure that\n\nthe market losses that occurred after December 31, 2000 were borne\n\nequally by all plan participants.\" For the exact reasons stated by\n\nthe district court, this is an inadequate explanation.\n\n           First, the district court found that the 7.5% market\n\ndecrease during the six months following December 31, 2000 was \"not\n\nunusual at all,\" and that not revaluing would not have put an\n\nespecially large burden on the remaining assets (the loss to the\n\nremaining assets would have been roughly 25%). Defendants have not\n\nshown that this essentially empirical analysis, in the context of\n\na plan provision for \"extraordinary\" adjustment dates, was wrong.\n\n           Second, the revaluations did distribute \"market losses\"\n\nequally among all plan participants, but they did not distribute\n\nthe losses attributable to Chibaro's fiduciary breaches equally\n\namong all participants.         The market losses that occurred after\n\nDecember   31,    2000,   to   the   extent   they   are   traceable    to    the\n\ndeparting assets, should not have occurred to begin with.                    Those\n\n\n                                      -24-\n\fassets should not have been in risky market investments after\n\nDecember 31, 2000, and the losses traceable to them were the direct\n\nresult   of    Chibaro's     fiduciary   breaches    in   failing      to   timely\n\nliquidate and segregate plan assets, and to obtain valuations. The\n\neffect of revaluation was to put all of the loss caused by these\n\nfiduciary breaches on the departing participants.               Keeping in mind\n\nthat the plan allowed for extraordinary revaluations only \"whenever\n\n. . . it would be inequitable to do otherwise,\" equity hardly\n\ndemanded      that    this   entire   loss    be    put   on    the    departing\n\nparticipants.8\n\n              Not revaluing would simply have left all of the avoidable\n\nlosses   due    to    Chibaro's   fiduciary   breaches     on    the   remaining\n\nparticipants.        Importantly, the vast majority (92%) of the assets\n\nthat would have been left to absorb the losses from Chibaro's\n\nfiduciary breaches belonged to Chibaro himself.            It would not have\n\nbeen inequitable for him to bear the brunt of the losses he\n\nwrongfully caused.9\n\n\n     8\n       Defendants characterize revaluation as necessary to prevent\nthe departing participants from \"obtaining a windfall\" at the\nexpense of the remaining participants. It is difficult to see how\nnot being forced to bear the entirety of losses that never should\nhave occurred in the first place, while the remaining participants\nbear none, can be labeled a \"windfall.\"\n     9\n       Defendants suggest that because the district court had ruled\nout a theory of recovery based on breach of fiduciary duty, it was\nsomehow improper, or an \"end-run around ERISA,\" to consider\nChibaro's   actual   fiduciary   breaches,   which   preceded   the\nrevaluations, in assessing the equities of revaluing.          This\nargument makes little sense, but as it is unsupported by any\n\n                                      -25-\n\f          Whatever the force of defendants' argument about the\n\nclause in the abstract, defendants acted as though it permitted\n\nunlimited retention of assets, keeping the assets of departing\n\nparticipants for nearly two years and performing a total of five\n\nvaluations.   The clause may not reasonably be read that way.\n\n                                  III.\n\n              Attorneys' Fees and Prejudgment Interest\n                     (Plaintiff's Cross-Appeal)\n\n          Janeiro's cross-appeal challenges the district court's\n\ndenial of attorneys' fees and prejudgment interest.\n\nA.

It was plausible, in evaluating whether to\n\naward attorneys' fees, to find that Chibaro subjectively thought he\n\nwas entitled to administer the plan as he did.\n\n            Analyzing the second factor, the district court expressed\n\na legitimate concern that the plan's assets were quite modest and\n\n\n\n\n                                      -27-\n\fwere already subject to a benefits award comprising at least two-\n\nfifths, and perhaps as much as two-thirds, of the total assets.10\n\n           Janeiro adds that even though \"the district court ruled\n\nin favor of USPA and Dr. Chibaro as to Dr. Janeiro's claims against\n\nthem,\" Chibaro's and the USPA's assets should still be fair game\n\nfor an award of attorneys' fees, because they were the key players\n\nthrough which the two plans acted.     Janeiro cites no authority for\n\ntreating the USPA and Chibaro as \"losing parties\" for purposes of\n\nattorneys' fees on a benefits claim that succeeded only against the\n\nplans.11   In any event, no matter whose and how plentiful were the\n\nassets available for an award of attorneys' fees, this factor would\n\nmean little.   \"An inability to afford attorneys' fees may counsel\n\n\n     10\n       Janeiro argues that plan assets financed Chibaro's defense,\nand that Chibaro, as the primary owner of the remaining assets,\nwould bear the brunt of a fee award to Janeiro. On appeal, Chibaro\nsays he bore (with his plan assets) the attorneys' fees and costs\nof defending this case.        If any payment was improper, an\nappropriate party may pursue the matter.\n     11\n       The breach of fiduciary duty claim was asserted only against\nChibaro and the USPA.      The claims for benefits, prejudgment\ninterest, and attorneys' fees did not specify defendants, although\nthe first claim did assert a right to sue \"the Plans.\"        It is\napparent from various pretrial filings that the parties understood\nthese three claims to be against all the defendants, including\nChibaro individually. Moreover, the judgment for Janeiro did not\nspecify which defendants were liable.      At trial, however, the\ndistrict court said, in disposing of the breach of fiduciary duty\nclaim, \"I do not see how [Janeiro] can maintain any claim against\n. . . Chibaro individually. I don't see how he can maintain claims\nagainst USPA in [its] capacity as a plan administrator. Instead,\nhis remaining claim is a claim for benefits which is properly\nasserted against the plans . . . .\" The court later reiterated\nthat Janeiro was entitled to relief only against the two plans.\nJaneiro does not develop any contrary argument on appeal.\n\n                                -28-\n\fagainst an award, but the capacity to pay, by itself, does not\n\njustify an award.\"   Cottrill, 100 F.3d at 227 (citation omitted).\n\n          Turning    to   the    third    factor,    the     district     court\n\ndetermined that the benefits award itself was large enough to deter\n\nsimilar misconduct, and that an award of attorneys' fees was\n\nunnecessary for that purpose.       Janeiro argues that denying fees\n\nsends the wrong message to the \"ERISA community\" and invites plan\n\nadministrators to \"play fast and loose\" with plan terms and with\n\ndeparting participants' money.       The district court, which viewed\n\nthe evidence in this case first-hand, disagreed, and we have no\n\nbasis for rejecting its conclusion.        See id.\n\n          The fourth factor is \"the benefit (if any) that the\n\nsuccessful suit confers on plan participants or beneficiaries\n\ngenerally.\"    Id.   at   225.     Nothing   in     the    district     court's\n\nconsideration of this factor required a different result.\n\n          Fifth and finally, the district court stressed that \"this\n\n[was] a close case using a de novo standard.\"              Indeed, the judge\n\nstated, it was one of the most difficult cases he had ever decided.\n\nCf. id. at 227 (\"The very fact that an experienced trial judge\n\noriginally found in the defendants' favor argues for a finding that\n\nthe defendants had a reasonable basis for [their position], even\n\nthough this court ultimately ruled against them.\").             The standard\n\nof review to apply to defendants' decision to revalue was not an\n\n\n\n\n                                   -29-\n\fopen-and-shut question, nor was the correctness of the decision\n\nitself.\n\n                The   district      court,    in     short,     did    not     abuse   its\n\ndiscretion in denying Janeiro attorneys' fees.\n\nB.              Prejudgment Interest\n\n                Janeiro seeks prejudgment interest on the $195,036 he won\n\nin the district court, and on the $456,644 he was paid in the fall\n\nof 2002, to the extent that payment was also late.                        The district\n\ncourt        denied   any   award,    saying       that   it   \"reach[ed]       the    same\n\nconclusion\" as it reached with respect to attorneys' fees, for\n\n\"much        the   same\"    reasons.         The    court      did    single    out    one\n\nconsideration -- the effect an award of interest would have on the\n\nplan -- but did not otherwise elaborate.\n\n                Although there is no specific statutory provision for\n\nprejudgment        interest    in    most    ERISA    cases,     such    awards,       like\n\nattorneys' fees, are \"available, but not obligatory.\"                        Id. at 223.\n\nWe review the denial of prejudgment interest in ERISA cases only\n\nfor abuse of discretion.12            Id.\n\n                Janeiro was wrongfully deprived of the use of money for\n\na substantial length of time, and prejudgment interest would make\n\n\n\n        12\n        Janeiro has not offered any developed argument that this\ncourt should adopt (or has already adopted) a presumption in favor\nof prejudgment interest.

The benefits claim\n\nitself was quite substantial in light of the total plan assets.\n\nCf. Goya Foods, Inc. v. Wallack Mgmt.

The court also thought the\n\nordinary attorneys' fees factors pertinent.          These factors might\n\nnot be automatically applicable in all prejudgment interest cases.\n\nBut Janeiro does not argue that these factors were impermissible\n\n\n\n\n                                    -31-\n\fconsiderations,13 and, as explained above in the attorneys' fees\n\ndiscussion, we see nothing wrong with how the court assessed them\n\nin light of the facts of this case.            The district court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in denying an award of prejudgment interest.\n\n                                     IV.\n\n                                  Conclusion\n\n              The district court's analysis of this case was careful\n\nand   fair.     Its   judgment,   awarding     plaintiff   $195,036   on   the\n\nbenefits claim and denying him an award of attorneys' fees and\n\nprejudgment interest, is affirmed.           The parties shall bear their\n\nown costs and attorneys' fees on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n      13\n       Indeed, Janeiro even relies on the deterrence factor --\nwhich, as already stated, the district court viewed as adequately\nserved by the large benefits award.\n\n                                     -32-\n\f</pre>",
