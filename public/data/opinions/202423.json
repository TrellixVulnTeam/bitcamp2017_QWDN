Maribel Negrón-Almeda, Aracelis\n\nGascot-Cuadrado,          and      Nilda     Pérez-Montalvo               (collectively,\n\n\"Plaintiffs\"),      former      employees        of   Puerto       Rico's     Commercial\n\nDevelopment Administration (\"CDA\"), brought suit against Carlos\n\nGabriel   Santiago,       Susana     Hernández        Colon,       and    Vilma    Jiménez\n\n(collectively, \"Defendants\"), officials of that agency, pursuant to\n\n42   U.S.C.    §   1983   for     wrongful       termination        because       of    their\n\npolitical affiliation.            Plaintiffs asserted that these adverse\n\nemployment actions violated their First Amendment rights under the\n\nUnited States Constitution.\n\n              At trial, Plaintiffs' case focused on the circumstances\n\nof their dismissals at the end of the probationary periods for\n\ntheir   career     positions.        At    the     close      of   Plaintiffs'          case,\n\nDefendants moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 50(a), asserting that Plaintiffs had not presented a\n\nprima facie case of political discrimination.                      The district court\n\ngranted   that     motion    in    part    and     denied     it    in    part.         After\n\nDefendants      presented       their      case,      which    sought        to    justify\n\nPlaintiffs' terminations because of their poor job performance,\n\nDefendants     renewed     their    Rule    50(a)      motion.           Relying       on   our\n\ndecision in Vázquez-Valentín v. Santiago-Díaz, 385 F.3d 23 (1st\n\nCir. 2004), which has now been vacated by the United States Supreme\n\nCourt on the basis of its decision in Unitherm Food Sys. v. Swift-\n\n\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fEckrich, 126 S. Ct. 980 (2006),1 the district court concluded that\n\nPlaintiffs      had    presented   insufficient     evidence   of    political\n\ndiscrimination to get their case to the jury.2             Conducting our own\n\nreview    of    the   evidence   presented   at   trial,   which    includes   a\n\ncredibility contest between Plaintiffs and Defendants over the\n\ncircumstances of Plaintiffs' job loss, we vacate the district\n\ncourt's judgment in favor of Defendants and remand for further\n\nproceedings.\n\n                                      I.\n\n               Before we summarize the evidence in this case, we must\n\ndescribe the ruling of the trial judge at the heart of this appeal.\n\nThe jury trial began on September 20, 2004.                 At the close of\n\nPlaintiffs' case on September 21, 2004, Defendants moved for\n\njudgment as a matter of law under Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a), asserting\n\nthat Plaintiffs had not presented sufficient evidence to reach the\n\n\n     1\n          See Vázquez-Valentín v. Santiago-Díaz, 126 S. Ct. 1329\n(2006).\n     2\n        Vázquez-Valentín v. Santiago-Díaz was another political\ndiscrimination case from Puerto Rico.       There, we reviewed a\ndistrict court's denial of the defendants' motion for judgment as\na matter of law pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a). The defendants\nasserted that the plaintiff had presented insufficient evidence of\npolitical discrimination to permit the case to go to the jury. We\nagreed.    See generally 385 F.3d at 23.     However, in order to\nconduct that evaluation of the defendants' motion, we excused the\ndefendants' failure to preserve that ground pursuant to Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 50(b), which requires renewal of a Rule 50(a) motion after\nthe jury has returned a verdict. In Unitherm, the Supreme Court\nruled that a party must renew its Rule 50(a) motion pursuant to\nRule 50(b), or that ground for appeal is waived. See generally 126\nS. Ct. at 980.\n\n                                      -3-\n\fjury on their case of political discrimination.                      Specifically,\n\nDefendants argued that Plaintiffs had not demonstrated that their\n\npolitical affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor in\n\ntheir terminations.       The district court granted Defendants' Rule\n\n50(a) motion in part and denied it in part:\n\n          (1)    All    claims      against    Vilma       Jiménez   (\"Jiménez\"),\n\nDirector of Human Resources and Legal Services, were dismissed;\n\n          (2)    The     claims      brought     by    Maribel       Negrón-Almeda\n\n(\"Negrón\") and Aracelis Gascot-Cuadrado (\"Gascot\") against Susana\n\nHernández Colon (\"Hernández\"), a Human Resources Officer, were\n\ndismissed;3\n\n          (3) The First Amendment claim of Nilda Pérez-Montalvo\n\n(\"Pérez\") against Hernández survived;\n\n          (4) The First Amendment claims of all of the Plaintiffs\n\nagainst Carlos Gabriel Santiago (\"Santiago\"), Administrator of the\n\nCDA, survived.\n\n          At    the    close   of   their     case    on   September    27,   2004,\n\nDefendants moved for judgment as a matter of law a second time on\n\nthe remaining claims, on essentially the same grounds as their\n\n\n     3\n       Plaintiffs do not appeal these dismissals prompted by\nDefendants' first Rule 50(a) motion. Plaintiffs had also brought\nclaims pursuant to Articles 1802 and 1803 of the Puerto Rico Civil\nCode, 31 LPRA §§ 5141 and 5142. These claims also did not survive\nthe district court's first Rule 50(a) ruling, and Plaintiffs did\nnot appeal that ruling. We also note that the court dismissed the\nclaims of another plaintiff, Miguelina Peguero-Moronta, prior to\ntrial in an Opinion and Order dated March 31, 2004. She is not\ninvolved in this appeal.\n\n                                       -4-\n\ffirst Rule 50(a) motion.     Ruling from the bench that same day, the\n\ndistrict court granted Defendants' motion.         In presenting their\n\nrenewed   Rule   50(a)   motion,   Defendants   relied   heavily   on   our\n\ndecision in Vázquez-Valentín, which was published during the trial.\n\nIt is also apparent from the record that the district court\n\nreviewed Vázquez-Valentín during the noon break between the morning\n\nsession of the trial -- when Defendants made their second Rule\n\n50(a) motion -- and the afternoon session when the district court\n\nruled on the motion.     The district court explained its reading of\n\nthe import of Vázquez-Valentín in these terms:\n\n          If this case -- if the case of Vázquez-Valentin did\n     not meet the standard of proof for jury submission as to\n     the fact of whether political discrimination was a\n     substantial or motivating factor in the challenged\n     employment action, then this case, that we are trying\n     now, the one that is before us, doesn't meet it, either.\n\n          The truth of the matter is that the case of Vázquez\n     . . . contained a lot more evidence of potential\n     discriminatory motives and of a circumstantial nature\n     than the one that we are trying.\n\n          So under those circumstances, it seems to me that I\n     don't see how I can let this case go to the jury . . . .\n     I recognize, and I know, on the basis of my experience,\n     that when these things happen in the context of positions\n     like this, usually you have to look carefully, because\n     there is always the good possibility that improper\n     political motives were behind the personnel action. But\n     it is not what I think; it is what the evidence sustains.\n\n          And obviously, the problem that I have here is that\n     there is no evidence other than a scintilla of evidence\n     to let this case go to a jury, and this case [Vázquez-\n     Valentín] is extremely clear as to what is required. And\n     the case before me doesn't satisfy the standard.\n\n     . . . .\n\n                                    -5-\n\f     So on the basis of that, I have no other alternative but\n     to disregard my own feelings as to what the case is and\n     enter a judgment under Rule 50, dismissing it on the\n     basis of insufficiency of evidence on the issue of\n     political discrimination under this case of Vázquez v.\n     Santiago [sic]. No other alternative.\n\n              Plaintiffs read this ruling as reflecting the district\n\ncourt's focus on the evidence in their case only and a disregard of\n\nthe evidence presented by Defendants.        If, in fact, the district\n\ncourt examined only the evidence presented in Plaintiffs' case when\n\ngranting Defendants' renewed Rule 50(a) motion, this would be an\n\nerror of law. See Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure,\n\nCivil 2d § 2534 (2d ed. 1994) (\"A renewed [Rule 50(a)(1)] motion\n\nwill be judged in the light of the case as it stands at that\n\ntime.\"); Potti v. Duramed Pharms, Inc., 938 F.2d 641, 645 (6th Cir.\n\n1991) (\"Our review of whether there was [sufficient] evidence [to\n\nsurvive judgment as a matter of law] . . . must be based on the\n\nentire record, not just the record at the end of plaintiffs' case,\n\nbecause [the defendant] proceeded to offer evidence in its own\n\ndefense.\").\n\n              Although Plaintiffs' reading of the district court's\n\nruling   is    plausible,   Defendants   advance   an   equally   plausible\n\nreading -- the district court evaluated all of the evidence adduced\n\nduring the trial when it announced its bench ruling.         For example,\n\nin an exchange with defense counsel concerning the renewed Rule\n\n50(a) motion, the district court insisted \"[r]emember, I wanted the\n\n[sic] hear the evidence as a whole.\"\n\n                                   -6-\n\f            In the end, we need not decide which characterization of\n\nthe district court's ruling is accurate.      Even if the district\n\ncourt had unambiguously focused only on Plaintiffs' evidence -- and\n\nhence had committed an error of law by disregarding Defendants'\n\nevidence when ruling on the renewed Rule 50(a) motion -- we could\n\nnot rule in Plaintiffs' favor if, in fact, the totality of the\n\nevidence did not permit their case to go to the jury.   We engage in\n\nde novo review of the district court's decision granting judgment\n\nas a matter of law.    See Webber v. Int'l Paper Co., 417 F.3d 229,\n\n233 (1st Cir. 2005).    We can affirm on any basis available in the\n\nrecord because \"[w]e are not wedded to the lower court's rationale,\n\nbut, rather, may affirm its order on any independent ground made\n\nmanifest by the record.\"   InterGen N.V. v. Grina, 344 F.3d 134, 141\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).   Therefore, the dispositive question on appeal is\n\nwhether, in light of the totality of the evidence, the district\n\ncourt correctly ruled that there was insufficient evidence of\n\npolitical discrimination to permit the Plaintiffs' case to go to\n\nthe jury.   To pursue this inquiry, and to provide an adequate basis\n\nfor explaining our decision, we must first set forth in some detail\n\nthe evidence adduced at trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f                                     II.\n\n           On November 7, 2000, general elections were held in\n\nPuerto Rico.   The Popular Democratic Party's (\"PDP\") candidate for\n\ngovernor won that election, leading to a change of administration\n\nfrom the incumbent New Progressive Party (\"NPP\") to the PDP.\n\nDefendant Santiago was appointed Administrator of the CDA on or\n\nabout January 7, 2001.      As such, he was in charge of all of the\n\nCDA's operations.    At the time of the change in regime, Defendant\n\nHernández served as a Human Resources Officer and Officer of Labor\n\nRelations, meaning that she carried out hiring and termination\n\ndecisions and managed payroll, with Santiago's approval. Plaintiff\n\nPérez worked in the human resources department of the CDA, where\n\nshe maintained attendance and payroll records.              Plaintiff Negrón\n\nserved as the director of the general services division.             She was\n\nresponsible for supervising the maintenance of the CDA's physical\n\nplant and equipment, obtaining supplies, and providing support for\n\nthe vehicles and equipment of her division.           Plaintiff Gascot was\n\ndirector of the CDA's management and entrepreneurial school.               Her\n\nduties   included   managing   the    school's     equipment   and   physical\n\nresources, budgeting, and planning the school's curriculum.\n\n           Within   three   to   four      weeks    after   the   change    of\n\nadministration in early January 2001, all of the Plaintiffs had\n\nlost their jobs at the CDA.          Plaintiffs' case consisted almost\n\nentirely of descriptions of what happened to them in those three to\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\ffour weeks, and the circumstances of their terminations from the\n\nCDA.       Defendants' case consisted entirely of explanations of why\n\nthey were justified in terminating Plaintiffs.                  Although the trial\n\nlasted six days, and included other witnesses,4 we summarize only\n\nthe    testimony        of   the   three   Plaintiffs     and   the   two   remaining\n\nDefendants.        For the testimony of each of the Plaintiffs -- Pérez,\n\nNegrón, and Gascot -- we divide the summary of their testimony into\n\nthree sections: (1) before the change of administration; (2) after\n\nthe    change      of    administration;      and   (3)    political    affiliation\n\ntestimony.         Then we summarize the testimony of Defendants --\n\nSantiago and Hernández -- with Santiago's testimony related as it\n\npertains to each of the three Plaintiffs; and Hernández's related\n\nonly as it pertains to Plaintiff Pérez.                    As noted earlier, the\n\nFirst Amendment claims of each of the three Plaintiffs against\n\nSantiago survived Defendants' first Rule 50(a) motion.                      But only\n\nPérez's claim against Hernández survived that same motion.\n\nA.    The Plaintiffs\n\n1.    Nilda Pérez-Montalvo\n\n              a.    Employment history before Santiago's arrival\n\n              Pérez obtained a bachelor's degree in economics and a\n\nmaster's degree in business administration, specializing in human\n\n\n\n       4\n       The other witnesses were the respective Plaintiffs' spouses.\nTheir testimony included their observations of their spouses in the\naftermath of their dismissals from the CDA, and the impact those\ndismissals had on their households.\n\n                                           -9-\n\fresources.    She worked in government for about nine years before\n\nleaving to raise her children.           At the time she left, she served as\n\nan economist at the Statistics Bureau in the Department of Labor.\n\nAfter her children matured, she decided to return to work.\n\n            She returned to work first in the private sector at a\n\ntemporary employment services company, Top Notch.                Top Notch told\n\nher   to   apply   for    a    vacant    secretarial   position    in   the   CDA\n\nadministrator's office, which she obtained.             While working in the\n\nadministrator's office, Pérez applied for and obtained a career\n\nposition in the CDA's human resources office.5\n\n            Pérez stated that her first task in her position in the\n\nhuman resources department was to update the time cards of all CDA\n\nemployees,    which      had   fallen     behind   since   her    predecessor's\n\ndeparture in December 1999.             She was \"supposed to check the time\n\ncards, the weekly time cards, that all the employees had to punch\n\nand check to see if they had worked every day, if they had not\n\nworked every day.        See if they had taken leave . . . .            In other\n\nwords, I was supposed to record their attendance on a weekly\n\nbasis.\"    Pérez testified that she performed this work, at least\n\n\n      5\n        \"Puerto Rico law distinguishes between 'career' employees\nand 'trust' employees. Career employees are permanent and may only\nbe removed from their positions for just cause after due filing of\ncharges. By contrast, trust employees shall be of free selection\nand   removal,   i.e.,   removable   with   or   without    cause.\"\nAguiar-Carrasquillo v. Agosto-Alicea, 445 F.3d 19, 23 n.2 (1st Cir.\n2006) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\finitially, on an adding machine, which her predecessor had done,\n\ndespite     her   knowledge     of     computer       programs   and     usage.\n\nSubsequently, she began to use a computer to do her work. She\n\nstated that the attendance records were current up to December 2000\n\nat the time of her termination.\n\n            As a probationary employee, Pérez was subject to periodic\n\nevaluations of her performance during the probationary period,\n\nwhich spanned from July 15, 2000 to January 15, 2001.                  She was\n\nevaluated three times prior to Santiago's appointment as head of\n\nthe CDA for the following time periods: (1) July 15, 2000 to\n\nSeptember 15, 2000; September 18, 2000 to November 15, 2000; and\n\n(3)   November    16,   2000   to    December   31,    2000.     These   prior\n\nevaluations, all of which were positive, were signed by Margarita\n\nMartinez, who was the director of the human resources department\n\nfor this period (and replaced by Jiménez when the administration\n\nchanged).    However, Pérez understood that Hernández, not Martinez,\n\nwas her immediate supervisor, although Pérez was never officially\n\ntold this.\n\n            b.       Employment   history    following   Santiago's\n            arrival and alleged performance deficiencies\n\n            Pérez stated that her final evaluation for her position\n\nin the human resources department covered the period from January\n\n1, 2001 to January 15, 2001, the final day of her probationary\n\nperiod.   She was evaluated by Hernández, her superior in the human\n\nresources office.       However, Pérez also stated that, during those\n\n                                      -11-\n\ffifteen days, she and Hernández were actually in the office at the\n\nsame time for only six and a half days because of weekends and\n\nholidays.   On this final written evaluation, Hernández had written\n\nthat Pérez was not receptive to instructions, unreliable, and\n\n\"rarely willing to collaborate.\"\n\n            No one reviewed Pérez's final evaluation with her. Also,\n\nPérez never received any verbal admonishment or reprimand for the\n\nvarious mistakes reported on the final evaluation.      The written\n\nevaluation was handed to her on her final day at the CDA, which was\n\nJanuary 12, 2001.6\n\n            On cross-examination, defense counsel questioned Pérez's\n\ntestimony that she had never been verbally reprimanded for errors\n\nshe committed in her work.    Defense counsel also asked about the\n\ndetails of those instances of error.   Pérez claimed that she had no\n\nrecollection of having committed any errors.

If the employee has had\n     more than one supervisor in different periods of\n     evaluation, it can be enough to use the criteria of one\n     of the supervisors for separation if this one considers\n     such action is to be taken.\n\n                                -12-\n\fquestioned Pérez regarding the necessity of using a computer to\n\ncomplete the tasks assigned to her.              Pérez contended that a\n\ncomputer was necessary to perform her tasks \"efficiently\".\n\n           c.    Political affiliations\n\n           Pérez testified that she was affiliated with the NPP and\n\nhad been since she was a teenager.         During election years, she had\n\nattended party meetings.         Although Pérez testified that she knew\n\nHernández's political affiliation, she never explicitly identified\n\nthat affiliation for the court.         As to Santiago, Pérez knew that he\n\nwas the new appointee for Administrator of the CDA for the incoming\n\nPDP administration.\n\n           Regarding      Defendants'      knowledge    of    her   political\n\naffiliation, Pérez stated that her affiliation with the NPP was\n\nwidely known at the CDA.          Politics was openly discussed at the\n\noffice, particularly during the 2000 election year, and she was\n\n\"very open about [her] affiliation . . . .        When [she] obtained the\n\nposition in the human resources office [she] spoke with [her]\n\nfellow co-workers there about [her] political affiliation.\"             Just\n\nbefore the 2000 elections, she stated that she had left to attend\n\nan NPP meeting during her lunch hour and all of her co-workers saw\n\nher leave.       While Pérez never directly discussed politics with\n\nHernández,      she   believed   that    Hernández     knew   her   political\n\naffiliation because there were only six people in her office at the\n\nCDA.   In her prior position in the CDA administrator's office, all\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\fof the employees were affiliated with the NPP, and she \"didn't hide\n\n[her affiliation] because [she] didn't have reason to.\"\n\n2.   Maribel Negrón-Almeda\n\n           a.   Employment history before Santiago's arrival\n\n           Negrón     had     a   bachelor's    degree      in     business\n\nadministration.     After obtaining her degree she began work in the\n\nprivate sector, where she worked until she married and left the\n\nworkforce for a time.       After that break, she began working at the\n\nCDA shortly before the change in administration.           Her position, a\n\ncareer position, had a six-month probationary period from August 1,\n\n2000 to January 31, 2001.\n\n           Negrón testified that she was evaluated three times prior\n\nto Santiago's arrival at the CDA for the following time periods:\n\n(1) August 1, 2000 to September 30, 2000; (2) October 1, 2000 to\n\nNovember 30, 2000; and (3) December 1, 2000 to December 31, 2000.\n\nJuan   Matos    Gonzalez,    Negrón's   supervisor   and    the   auxiliary\n\nsuperintendent of the CDA prior to the change in administration,\n\nperformed these evaluations, all of which were positive.           Gonzalez\n\noccupied a trust position and tendered his resignation effective\n\nDecember 31, 2000.    To Negrón's knowledge, no one was appointed to\n\nreplace him following Santiago's arrival.\n\n           b. Employment history following Santiago's arrival and\n           alleged performance deficiencies\n\n           Plaintiffs' counsel asked Negrón about some \"incidents\"\n\nthat occurred following the arrival of Santiago.             One incident\n\n                                   -14-\n\finvolved changing the locks on the door of Santiago's office.\n\nAccording to Negrón, Santiago's secretary instructed her to have\n\nthe   lock   installed   a    certain   way,   and   Negrón   contacted   the\n\nappropriate company and conveyed these instructions. However, the\n\ntechnician installed the lock incorrectly. \"The following day\n\n[Negrón] was told there was a problem.         [She] once more called the\n\ncompany.     The company came back and they once more reinstalled the\n\nlock.\" The only verbal admonishment Negrón acknowledged \"had to do\n\nwith [this incident].        That was the wrong way.    So we proceeded to\n\nchange it.\"\n\n             Another incident involved the placement of some file\n\ncabinets and other furniture, including a counter/desk.              Negrón\n\ntestified that once she received the requests from Santiago, she\n\nattempted to contact the two employees who performed these duties;\n\nhowever, the position for one of those employees was vacant, and\n\nthe other employee was \"quite old[,] and those file cabinets\n\nweighed approximately 100 pounds.\"         She informed Santiago of the\n\nproblem, but told him that she would ask two other employees to do\n\nthe moving.      Because these two employees were not specifically\n\ntasked with this type of work, they had to coordinate schedules to\n\nfind a time that would work, which caused a delay in the moving of\n\nthe cabinets.    To Negrón's recollection, Santiago was pleased with\n\nthe work that was done.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\f            Negrón also recalled Santiago asking her \"to have an air\n\nconditioner duct moved which was in his office.\"            She \"coordinated\n\nwith the company that had the air conditioning contract . . . [and]\n\nreceived the estimate for the work.\"      However, that work was never\n\ncarried out while Negrón was at the CDA \"because [Santiago] never\n\nsigned the authorization for [her].\"\n\n            On her final evaluation, for the period from January 9,\n\n2001 to January 31, 2001, Santiago gave her failing marks.            In the\n\nwritten evaluation Negrón received, Santiago stated that Negrón had\n\nignored    his   instructions   and   performed     tasks    carelessly   and\n\nnegligently.     The evaluation contained similar comments about her\n\ncooperativeness.     Negrón stated that Santiago never discussed his\n\nnegative evaluation with her.     Negrón testified that Santiago gave\n\nthe evaluation to her at the end of the work day on January 31,\n\n2001, her final day at the CDA, and informed her that she did not\n\npass her probationary period.\n\n            On cross-examination, defense counsel questioned Negrón's\n\naccount of her performance of the tasks requested by Santiago.\n\nSpecifically, he asked her: whether the furniture and file cabinets\n\nwere moved on the same day that she was told to have them moved;\n\nfor more details as to why the air conditioner was never installed;\n\nand whether the lock had been installed improperly because she\n\nconveyed    inaccurate   instructions    to   the    technician.     Negrón\n\nresponded that: any delay in moving furniture and file cabinets was\n\n\n                                  -16-\n\fcaused by unavoidable logistical issues, and the objects were moved\n\nas fast as possible; the air conditioner was not installed because\n\nSantiago never gave proper written authorization; and the improper\n\ninstallation was the result of an error by the technician (rather\n\nthan an error in her instructions) that was corrected as soon as\n\nwas possible.\n\n            c.   Political affiliations\n\n            Negrón testified that she had been affiliated with the\n\nNPP since \"[she] was very young.\"      This affiliation was formalized\n\nin June 2000 when she went to an NPP office and filled out\n\npaperwork to that effect. Negrón stated that she knew the political\n\naffiliation of Santiago: \"[D]uring the few times that I was able to\n\ntalk to him he would stress that he enjoyed the full trust of the\n\ngovernor and he would always say that he enjoyed a position of\n\ntrust because he had the governor's trust, so I understood that he\n\nhad -- he was affiliated to that party [PDP].\"              In particular,\n\nNegrón    recalled     Santiago   raising   this    issue    of   political\n\naffiliation when he asked her to change the car that had been\n\nassigned to him at the CDA.\n\n            As   for    Defendants'    knowledge     of     her   political\n\naffiliation, Negrón believed that her affiliation was known at the\n\nCDA because \"the elections were already approaching by that time.\n\n. . .    [I]n my area people would talk. . . .       We would talk about\n\nwho would win and who would lose . . . .           We would talk and you\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\fwould talk about who you felt was going to win and everybody just\n\nknew your party.\"\n\n3.    Aracelis Gascot-Cuadrado\n\n            a. Employment history before Santiago's arrival\n\n            Gascot     had     a    bachelor's       degree        in    business\n\nadministration, with a focus on secondary education, and a master's\n\ndegree in administration and supervision of schools. She worked as\n\na teacher in a number of high schools, and then later in a\n\nsuperintendent's office until 1993 when she began working in the\n\nCDA   as   the   entrepreneurial    director,      which   at     that   time    was\n\ncategorized as an \"Assistant II\" position.                 She worked in this\n\nposition for seven years.          In the spring of 2000, Gascot became\n\naware of a posting, dated April 14, 2000, for the position of\n\ndirector of the CDA's management and entrepreneurial school, a\n\ncareer position. She applied for and obtained this position, which\n\nhad   an   \"eight-month      probation    period    [and]     I    was   to     have\n\nevaluations every two months . . . the first evaluation undertaken\n\nfrom June the 1st to July the 31st.           The first of the first two\n\nmonths of work.\"      The probation period would end on January 31,\n\n2001. Gascot's duties included managing the school's equipment and\n\nphysical     resources,      budgeting,     and    planning       the    school's\n\ncurriculum.\n\n            Within that eight-month period, Gascot was evaluated for\n\nthe following time periods: (1) June 1, 2000 to July 31, 2000; (2)\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\fAugust 1, 2000 to September 30, 2000; (3) October 1, 2000 to\n\nNovember 30, 2000; and (4) December 1, 2000 to December 31, 2000.\n\nThese evaluations were performed by Gonzalez.   Gascot received all\n\npositive evaluations.   After Gonzalez's departure following the\n\nchange in administration, Gascot was not informed of anyone taking\n\nGonzalez's position.\n\n          b. Employment history following Santiago's arrival and\n          alleged employment deficiencies\n\n          Aside from a general, agency-wide meeting where he was\n\nintroduced to the CDA as the newly-appointed administrator on\n\nJanuary 9, Gascot recalled only \"one occasion in which [she] met\n\npersonally with Santiago,\" which occurred on January 14 or 15.   On\n\nthat occasion she went to his office: \"[a] group of employees was\n\ndismissed [from their jobs] and he asked me to explain to him\n\nregarding an aid program for them.   I explained to him what the\n\nprogram was about, and what was normally done.\" Gascot stated that\n\nSantiago never discussed the nature of her work at the CDA and\n\nnever conducted any evaluation of the program she directed. Gascot\n\ntestified that \"during the transitionary period a report was made\n\nfor the work performed at the school and it stated the amount of\n\nparticipants which had increased and the working plan.\"    While it\n\nis unclear from the record whether Gascot prepared this report\n\nherself, Gascot stated that Santiago never requested from her\n\neither statistics about the school or that working plan.\n\n\n\n                              -19-\n\f           On her final evaluation, for the period from January 1 to\n\nJanuary 31, Gascot noted that as to her planning, organization, and\n\nperformance,   Santiago     had   written    the    same    thing:    \"improper\n\nutilization of funds and resources available in the offering of\n\ncourses, careless in the effective maintenance of the vehicle\n\nassigned to the school.\"      Gascot testified that this \"evaluation\n\nwas not discussed with me at any time\" and \"was given to me on\n\nJanuary 31, 2001.      That was the date that ended my probation\n\nperiod.\"   On January 31, Gascot was told not to leave work that day\n\nwithout going to the administrator's office.                She went to the\n\nadministrator's office at 5:10 pm, where she was handed a letter\n\nthat read, in part: \"[i]n view of the above, effective today,\n\nJanuary 31, 2001, you are being separated from the position you\n\nhave been occupying at the agency.           If you are not in agreement\n\nwith this decision you are entitled to discuss it within the next\n\nten days with the personnel administration.\"               Gascot stated that\n\n\"[w]hen the document was given to me and I was about to talk . . .\n\n[Defendant] Ms. Vilma Giménez [sic] tells me that that [sic] is not\n\nthe forum for me to talk.\"\n\n           According   to    Gascot,   it     was    only    later,     through\n\nSantiago's deposition, that she learned why Santiago had given her\n\nsuch a negative final evaluation.           Gascot recalled that Santiago\n\nhad \"said that [she] had been assigned a mobile unit [truck] . . .\n\n[which] was deteriorated and [she] had used it wrongly and it was\n\n\n                                   -20-\n\fnot well used and there were badly used funds.\"                        To Gascot's\n\nknowledge, the vehicle was purchased by a prior administrator in\n\n1995 or 1996 for the CDA.            It was her understanding that \"[a]ll\n\nagency vehicles are under the General Services Administration.\n\nThey are the ones who provide maintenance of the vehicles.\" Gascot\n\nclaimed that she never used the vehicle during her time as director\n\nof the managerial school.           Gascot also learned through Santiago's\n\ndeposition that rumors came to him from other business centers and\n\nbusiness     people     that   the        courses   were      \"inefficient\"    and\n\n\"nonoperative,\" but he could not recall the names of anyone from\n\nwhom he heard these rumors.\n\n             On cross-examination, Gascot again testified that she\n\nbelieved that the agency vehicle for which Santiago held her\n\nresponsible was, in fact, \"the responsibility of the general\n\nservices department,\" which, as of August 2000, was run by Negrón.\n\n             c.   Political affiliations\n\n             Gascot stated that she was affiliated with the NPP, and\n\nhad   been   since    she   first    voted    forty    (40)    years   ago.     She\n\nparticipated in ladies' groups, political reelection groups, and\n\nprofessional agencies. She also belonged to an NPP group comprised\n\nof CDA employees that met outside of working hours.                     During the\n\n2000 election, Gascot participated in municipal campaigns, and\n\nserved as an election functionary, checking voter lists. Gascot\n\ntestified    that     she   knew    the    political    affiliations      of   both\n\n\n                                       -21-\n\fHernández and Santiago -- they were both members of the PDP.                As to\n\nHernández, Gascot stated that Hernández \"had been working [at the\n\nCDA] for many years.       She has held high posts within her town.\n\nShe's also worked within her political party and it is known\n\nthroughout all the [CDA] employees that she belongs to the Popular\n\nDemocratic Party.\"    As to Santiago, Gascot testified that \"when he\n\ncame to the [CDA] he came from COFEC [Corporation for the Economic\n\nDevelopment of the Capital City] . . . .                It was a department\n\nwithin   the   municipality     of   San   Juan   created    when   Sila   Maria\n\nCalderon [the new PDP governor] was there.\"\n\n           Gascot testified that her affiliation was known at the\n\nCDA because she first arrived at the CDA as a special aide under an\n\nNPP administration, a trust position. Gascot recalled specifically\n\nthat Hernández had direct knowledge of her affiliation.                    Gascot\n\nrecalled an incident when she first started working as the director\n\nof the managerial school.       Hernández, who Gascot identified as the\n\n\"institutional    brain\"   of    the    CDA,   asked   her   to   identify   her\n\npolitical affiliation. By \"institutional brain,\" Gascot understood\n\nHernández to be an individual who \"dedicate[s] themselves to\n\nidentify[ing] the [political affiliation of the] people when they\n\ncome in.\" Hernández was \"the person who knows everybody in there.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                       -22-\n\fB.   The Defendants\n\n1.   Carlos Gabriel Santiago\n\n             Before being appointed as head of the CDA, Santiago was\n\nappointed the executive president of COFEC, \"a corporation of\n\neconomic development for the capital city [of Puerto Rico].                        It is\n\na development company which gives loans to small businesses in San\n\nJuan   and   also       other   municipalities        in   the    island.\"        He   was\n\nappointed     by    COFEC's      board   of   twelve       directors.        He   became\n\nadministrator of the CDA on January 7, 2001, and he \"stopped being\n\nthe director in January 2002.\"\n\n             a.    Pérez\n\n             While Santiago acknowledged that Hernández made the final\n\ndecision     on    Pérez's      retention     of    her    position   following        her\n\nprobationary period, he stated that Hernández had consulted with\n\nhim.    Hernández told him that she \"wasn't satisfied with the\n\ninefficient way that Pérez was performing the task of her job, and\n\n[Hernández] understood that [Pérez] wasn't going to fulfill the\n\nexpectations       of    the    position.\"         Santiago      ultimately   endorsed\n\nHernández's dismissal of Pérez.\n\n             On cross-examination by Plaintiff's counsel, Santiago\n\nconceded that prior to Pérez's termination, Santiago did not speak\n\nto her to discuss his intentions to terminate her.                       He admitted\n\nthat he did not remember if Hernández had told him about Pérez's\n\n\n\n\n                                         -23-\n\feducational qualifications or the fact that Pérez's position had\n\nbeen vacant for six months prior to her filling that position.\n\n          b.     Negrón\n\n          Santiago stated that he got to know Negrón and that \"her\n\nperformance was low, very low . . . more than poor.              It was just\n\nbad.\" He testified that he gave her instructions to move furniture\n\nand file cabinets, change locks, and repair air conditioners.             As\n\nto the moving of furniture and file cabinets, he stated that he\n\ngave Negrón the instruction personally, but she did not comply.\n\nMoreover, Santiago stated that Negrón misplaced the file cabinets\n\n\"because it was more than an issue of instructions or permission.\n\nIt was more of [Negrón] started establishing territory in the\n\nagency . . . .    So it was more of hostility to me.\"       He stated that\n\nthe file cabinets were misplaced and Negrón's reaction was simply\n\n\"[t]hat there was no space anywhere else except in my office.\"            On\n\nanother occasion involving the moving of files, according to\n\nSantiago, it \"took a few days, three or four days, because the\n\nargument was the same: There was no space, so those had to remain\n\nthere.\"\n\n          As to the counter/desk, Santiago stated that Negrón\n\n\"counterordered\"    the   moving   of     the   counter   from   a   location\n\npreferred by Santiago. He felt \"concerned and even pressured\n\npsychologically because the situation was more than just me saying\n\nthings one way and things happening another.         And it was more of a\n\n\n                                   -24-\n\fcontroversy.\"     As to the air conditioning duct, Santiago confirmed\n\nthat the air conditioning in his office was never repaired.                    He\n\nalso confirmed that the reason \"was that the order had to be in\n\nwriting.\"    However, Santiago testified that he thought this was\n\nunreasonable.         \"[Negrón] insisted that every task that she was\n\nordered to do, even if it was the simplest of tasks, had to be in\n\nwriting . . . it wasn't enough that it had to be [in] a memorandum\n\nfor [Negrón], but it also had to be -- the requisition had to be\n\nsigned. . . . the process was done twice for whatever was needed.\"\n\nAccording to him, he asked Negrón three times to fix the air\n\nconditioning duct, and it was never done.\n\n            As to the installation of a new lock on his office door,\n\nSantiago recalled that he was in his office when it was installed.\n\nAfter the installation, when he went to leave, \"the lock [was]\n\ninstalled inside out, meaning that the lock that has the key is on\n\nthe inside, and on the outside is the part where you can do it\n\nmanually. . . .        And so I am locked in my office.          I am trapped.\"\n\nHis specific complaint was that Negrón did not remain to supervise\n\nthe installation of the lock. In his opinion, with the lock\n\nincident    as   an    exemplar,   \"it   was   impossible   to    articulate   a\n\nparticular operational plan with [Negrón] because, if things this\n\nsimple could not be solved and saying that this was simply a\n\nmistake . . . it was something that would concern any supervisor .\n\n. . . it even got to the point in my mind that I concluded that, if\n\n\n                                     -25-\n\fever there was a person that was not going to cooperate . . . it\n\nwas [Negrón].\"\n\n            On    his    final    evaluation     of   Negrón,   regarding    the\n\n\"performance\" factor, Santiago stated that Negrón \"did not meet the\n\ngoals and objectives, be them small as they could be, and also the\n\neffective solutions of unforeseen situations like the one regarding\n\nthe lock . . . .          It shouldn't be the duty of a director to\n\nconstantly be in controversy with the head of an agency.                It [was\n\nher duty] to keep in operational conditions the physical facilities\n\nof the agency, which [Negrón] did not perform, did not do.\"                 As to\n\nthe \"cooperation\" factor, \"[Negrón] didn't have the appropriate\n\nattitude.    It was more of a serious problem in terms of personality\n\nin terms of trying to be in controversy all the time.                And also to\n\ncollaborate . . . that never happened. . . . And to obtain the\n\nmaximum effort from the personnel.              [Negrón] never complied with\n\nthis.   On the contrary, she prevented things from happening.\"\n\nAccording to Santiago, the period from January 9 to January 31 was\n\n\"more than enough\" time to observe Negrón's performance.                      He\n\ntreated this stretch of time as 20 days.\n\n            On cross-examination, Santiago revised this number of\n\ndays for observing Negrón to 16.             He also admitted that his office\n\nwas isolated from Negrón's (a floor away) such that he only\n\nobserved    her   when    the    two   had   direct   interaction.     Santiago\n\nconceded that one of the pieces of furniture that he requested be\n\n\n                                        -26-\n\fmoved, a counter, was something that Negrón could not move on her\n\nown.     As to the lock, Plaintiffs' counsel asked, among other\n\nthings, why Santiago did not prevent the incorrect installation of\n\nthe lock since he was in his office when it was installed.\n\nSantiago stated that he was occupied with work and that the door\n\nwas    actually    some     distance    from    his    desk.     As      to   the   air\n\nconditioning problem, Plaintiffs' counsel asked Santiago whether it\n\nwas    in   fact    reasonable     policy      for    Negrón    to    have    written\n\nauthorization      for    work   done   in     order    to   keep    a   record     for\n\naccounting purposes, and because checks were issued by a separate\n\ndepartment of the CDA.           Santiago replied that Negrón's paperwork\n\n\"was additional,\" meaning redundant.                   Plaintiffs' counsel also\n\nquestioned Santiago as to the difficulty of completing Negrón's\n\npaperwork (essentially, writing \"Approved\").                   Santiago responded\n\nthat it would set a problematic precedent, requiring signatures for\n\neverything.\n\n             3.    Gascot\n\n             Santiago stated that he had an opportunity to evaluate\n\nGascot's performance, which he described as \"'poor,' that it did\n\nnot meet the standard.\"            He claimed that as far as planning,\n\ncoordinating, and directing the entrepreneurial school, Gascot\n\n\"peformed duties that were more of a routine, more of a day-to-day\n\noperational basis and instead of planning and coordinating and\n\nlooking to the future, that effort did not exist.\"                        As to the\n\n\n                                        -27-\n\fagency vehicle in dispute, Santiago stated that Gascot \"and I had\n\nhad   our   differences   in     how   to    use    the   mobile   truck     to   the\n\nentrepreneurial school, the fact that it had been abandoned in the\n\nparking lot of the agency to be deteriorated.\"                He testified that\n\nthe vehicle was assigned to the entrepreneurial school; the funds\n\nfor it came from the entrepreneurial school; and the side of the\n\nvehicle said \"Commercial Development, Entrepreneurial School.\"\n\nSantiago identified documents confirming the disrepair of the\n\nvehicle,    dated     December     28,       2000   and    January     11,    2001.\n\nAdditionally,    auditors      from    the    controller's    office    requested\n\ndocuments and information from Negrón regarding the purchase,\n\nmaintenance, and future use of the agency vehicle in question.\n\n            Santiago stated that he believed that no one in the CDA\n\nwanted to be responsible for the vehicle -- \"[t]he entrepreneurial\n\nschool said it was from general services, and general services said\n\nit belonged to the entrepreneurial school.\"                In summary, Santiago\n\nexpected     Gascot    \"[t]o      assume       responsibility,       to      assume\n\nresponsibility for things that are under her direct supervision .\n\n. . [b]ut that didn't even happen.\"            Santiago also claimed that he\n\n\"never saw [an] annual plan [for training services] from\" Gascot.\n\nHe continued \"I honestly think that . . . Gascot didn't have the\n\ncapacity to prepare such a plan.\"\n\n            Santiago also testified that Gascot failed to develop or\n\npropose a number of plans: a \"capacitation plan\" for communication\n\n\n                                       -28-\n\fbetween the central school in San Juan and centers throughout the\n\nisland;    \"a study of needs . . .            to develop a study determining\n\nthe   needs    for   training    which      is   offered   to   businessmen\";     a\n\n\"promotion advertising plan\" for \"what was going to be published in\n\nthe   advertisements.\"          Additionally,      he   criticized     Gascot    for\n\nallowing \"the course of offering of the entrepreneurial school [to]\n\nbecome obsolete or inefficient in terms to what the businessmen\n\nwanted.\"\n\n              Santiago claimed that he spoke to Gascot about all of\n\nthese failures, but she gave her \"usual response, that she didn't\n\ngive me a clue -- or she didn't give me any way that I could\n\nbelieve that she was going to be in charge of that, that she would\n\ntake care of it.\"        He conceded that \"[c]ertainly there were other\n\nissues\" on his mind during the transition period, but that he\n\ndevoted \"from five to 10 hours\" to the entrepreneurial school and\n\nGascot.    He stated that he \"saw the [prior] evaluations in the\n\nfile, but those evaluations were not in agreement with what [he]\n\nsaw . . . of Gascot's work performance.\"                He performed the final\n\nevaluation of Gascot with the help of Hernández and Jiménez.\n\n              On cross-examination, Santiago admitted that his office\n\nwas a number of floors away from that of Gascot, and he only\n\nobserved   her    when    the   two   had    direct     interaction.     He     also\n\nidentified a transition report that was given to him on his arrival\n\nat the CDA, which stated that the agency vehicle for which Gascot\n\n\n                                       -29-\n\fwas responsible was purchased from \"General Services by Commercial\n\nDevelopment Services\" and that the vehicle was already eight years\n\nold when it was purchased, meaning it was twelve years old when\n\nSantiago first saw it.      Santiago also conceded that evaluations of\n\nan employee's probationary period should only take into account\n\nactions performed during that period.\n\n            Plaintiffs' counsel also questioned Santiago about an\n\napparent inconsistency between his testimony on direct examination\n\nand   his   response   to   an    interrogatory   prior   to   trial.    The\n\ninterrogatory had asked for any and all reasons for dismissing\n\nGascot; Santiago listed and explained only the vehicle incident.\n\nHe did not mention any inability to engage in planning.             Santiago\n\nalso stated that, even though he was an accountant, he did not\n\ncheck the agency's property ledger to determine, ultimately, who\n\nwas responsible for the vehicle, but that he \"must have sent\n\nsomebody to check it.\"\n\n            Under   further      questioning   from   Plaintiffs'   counsel,\n\nSantiago identified a 2000/2001 work plan for the entrepreneurial\n\nschool, but stated that he had never seen the document.             He also\n\nconceded that when he left the CDA a year after becoming its\n\nadministrator, the courses being offered by the entrepreneurial\n\nschool had not changed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -30-\n\f2.   Susana Hernández Colon\n\n           Hernández's testimony focused only on Pérez.7    On direct\n\nexamination, Hernández testified to a number of instances where\n\nPérez \"worked [] attendance sheets without being duly authorized by\n\nthe immediate supervisor . . . meaning that the agency would pay\n\nemployees that had not been working.\"      However, on questioning by\n\nthe district court as to whether \"somebody else could have been at\n\nfault,\" Hernández conceded that it was possible \"that more than one\n\nperson may have been involved in this negligence.\"     Hernández also\n\nrecounted incidents where she directly asked Pérez to review the\n\nvacation (\"leave\") records of certain employees, including some\n\noutgoing ones.   According to Hernández,    Pérez committed errors on\n\nthese types of records as well, the consequence being that \"we\n\nwould have paid the employee less days when the employee would have\n\nhad a right to be paid their full days.\"    Pérez was working on nine\n\ncases during her final probation period in January 2001, and\n\nHernández testified that \"this work area is simple.     It is simple\n\nmath that one has to do, but you are not simply calculating work\n\ndays . . . out of nine cases, six cases that weren't worked right\n\n. . . I mean more than half the work that she did was bad.\"\n\n           Hernández testified that the only equipment necessary for\n\nattendance work was a calculator; a computer was unnecessary.\n\n\n     7\n       As noted earlier, the claims of the other two Plaintiffs\nagainst Hernández had been dismissed by the district court in\nresponse to Defendants' first Rule 50(a) motion.\n\n                                -31-\n\fHernández also stated that Pérez used a computer to do this work\n\nwhen other employees in the human resources department required use\n\nof a computer.         Later, Hernández \"approached [Pérez], and [told\n\nher] that instructions had been given so that she would leave the\n\ndesk that had the computer, move to another desk, so that the\n\ncomputer could be used by the human resources analyst.\"                    According\n\nto Hernández, Pérez refused to move.\n\n              In her final evaluation of Pérez, covering January 1 to\n\nJanuary 15, Hernández found Pérez had not been compliant in three\n\nareas: availability to learn, reliability, and cooperation.                    As to\n\navailability to learn, Hernández stated that Pérez \"was given\n\ninstructions toward her work, toward specific functions . . . and\n\nshe worked them wrong.\"         As to reliability, Hernández testified\n\nPérez \"didn't prove capable of following instructions.                     Also . . .\n\nit is more that . . . she didn't want to do what was said to her.\n\nShe didn't assume the responsibilities of the position.\"                      As for\n\ncooperation, Hernández recalled specifically Pérez's refusal to\n\nallow others to use the computer that she was using.\n\n              On cross-examination, Hernández admitted that during\n\nPérez's final period of probation, she actually supervised Pérez a\n\ntotal of only six to seven days.                She conceded that the final\n\nevaluation     report    was   supposed    to    be   given,    in    accord    with\n\nregulations, ten days before the date of separation.                   In Pérez's\n\ncase,   the    final    evaluation   was    only      given    on    the    date   of\n\n\n                                     -32-\n\fseparation, which was January 12. Although in her final evaluation\n\nshe speculated that Pérez did not want to continue working at the\n\nCDA, she acknowledged that four years ago she had considered Pérez\n\na hard worker who would never leave her position.\n\n          Plaintiffs'   counsel    also   questioned   Hernández   about\n\nPérez's apparent errors.    Hernández testified that some of the\n\n\"errors\" she testified to on direct examination occurred before she\n\nbecame Pérez's supervisor; that it is improper to evaluate an\n\nemployee based on things that were done during a period for which\n\nthe employee had already been evaluated; and that one type of error\n\nhad nothing to do with Pérez at all.       Hernández also stated that\n\nall of the attendance and payment records are recalculated at the\n\nend of a calendar year or when an employee leaves the agency before\n\nthe end of the year.    Errors made in the initial calculation are\n\nusually caught and corrected to avoid improper payment.\n\n                                  III.\n\n          In light of this evidence, we must now decide if the\n\ndistrict court ruled correctly that there was insufficient evidence\n\nof political discrimination for Plaintiffs' case to reach the jury.\n\nIn conducting this review, we keep in mind that Rule 50(a) motions:\n\n     will be granted only in those instances where, after\n     having examined the evidence as well as all permissible\n     inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to\n     non-movant, the court finds that a reasonable jury could\n     not render a verdict to the party's favor. In carrying\n     out this analysis the court may not take into account the\n     credibility of witnesses, resolve evidentiary conflicts,\n\n\n                                  -33-\n\f       nor ponder the weight of the evidence introduced at\n       trial.\n\nFigueroa-Torres v. Toledo-Davila, 232 F.3d 270, 273 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n(quoting Irvine v. Murad Skin Research Labs, Inc., 194 F.3d 313,\n\n316-17   (1st   Cir.   1999)).     Even    though   we   draw   all   rational\n\ninferences from the facts in favor of the non-moving party, that\n\nparty \"is not entitled to inferences based on speculation and\n\nconjecture.\"    Ferreru v. Zayas, 914 F.2d 309, 311 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\nA non-moving party who bears the burden of proof, as Plaintiffs do\n\nhere, must have presented \"more than a mere scintilla of evidence\n\nin its favor\" to withstand a motion for judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw.   Invest Almaz v. Temple-Inland Forest Prods. Corp., 243 F.3d\n\n57, 76 (1st Cir. 2001).          Additionally, we are not obligated to\n\ndisregard uncontradicted evidence offered by defendants. Santiago-\n\nNegron v. Castro-Davila, 865 F.2d 431, 445 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\nA.   Proving and defending political discrimination claims\n\n           A government employee who does not occupy a policy-making\n\nposition of confidence and trust, such as Plaintiffs here, is\n\nprotected from adverse employment decisions based on the employee's\n\npolitical affiliation.     See Figueroa-Serrano v. Ramos-Alverio, 221\n\nF.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2000).           A plaintiff bringing a political\n\ndiscrimination claim bears the burden of \"producing sufficient\n\ndirect or circumstantial evidence from which a jury reasonably may\n\ninfer that [his] constitutionally protected conduct -- in this\n\ncase, political affiliation . . . was a substantial or motivating\n\n                                    -34-\n\ffactor behind [his] dismissal.\" Acevedo-Diaz v. Aponte, 1 F.3d 62,\n\n66 (1st Cir. 1993) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Mt.\n\nHealthy City Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274 (1977).            A\n\nplaintiff bears the burden of persuasion on this issue throughout\n\nthe case.\n\n            Proving that political affiliation was a substantial or\n\nmotivating factor in an adverse employment decision requires more\n\nthan \"[m]erely juxtaposing a protected characteristic -- someone\n\nelse's politics -- with the fact that the plaintiff was treated\n\nunfairly.\"    Padilla-García v. Guillermo Rodríguez, 212 F.3d 69, 74\n\n(1st Cir. 2000) (internal citation omitted); see also Mercado-\n\nAlicea v. P.R. Tourism Co., 396 F.3d 46, 52 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(\"Statements of political affiliation -- unaccompanied by any\n\nspecific factual information to support the claim and unrelated to\n\nany employment action taken by defendant against plaintiff are\n\npatently     insufficient   to   establish   an   act   of   political\n\ndiscrimination.\") (citing López-Carrasquillo v. Rubianes, 230 F.3d\n\n409, 414 (1st Cir. 2000) (internal citation and quotation marks\n\nomitted)). The Supreme Court has cautioned that the mere fact that\n\nan adverse action was taken after an employee exercises First\n\nAmendment rights is not enough by itself to establish a prima facie\n\ncase.   See Board of County Comm'rs v. Umbehr, 518 U.S. 668, 684-85\n\n(1996).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -35-\n\f          To meet this burden, political discrimination plaintiffs\n\noften present evidence of verbal or written statements of political\n\nor personal animus. See, e.g., Rodríguez-Marín v. Rivera-González,\n\n438 F.3d 72, 76 (1st Cir. 2006) (witness testified that a defendant\n\nhad \"made several comments to her to the effect that he was under\n\npolitical pressure for leaving too many NPP members in cushy\n\npositions\"); id. at 78 (witness testified that a defendant insisted\n\nthat she use phraseology consistent with a particular political\n\nparty); id. at 81 (witness testified that the defendants \"made\n\nstatements to her indicating that her demotion was politically\n\nmotivated\").   Plaintiffs who have lost their jobs also present\n\nevidence about the hiring practices of the defendant in the wake of\n\nan election generally -- i.e., evidence that the defendants filled\n\nall, or most, recently vacated positions with supporters of their\n\npolitical affiliation -- or, more specifically, evidence that the\n\nplaintiff's immediate successor had the same affiliation as the\n\ndefendant.   For example, in Acosta-Orozco v. Rodriguez-de-Rivera,\n\n132 F.3d 97 (1st Cir. 1997), where \"the plaintiffs were all members\n\nof the adverse party . . . their superiors knew this, and . . .\n\ntheir duties were given to active supporters of the party in\n\npower,\" we found there was ample evidence for the plaintiffs' case\n\nto avoid summary judgment.   Id. at 101; see also Rodriguez-Rios v.\n\nCordero, 138 F.3d 22, 24 (\"[O]ther evidence adduced by plaintiff\n\nestablished a prima facie case . . . .    [P]laintiff adduced that\n\n\n                                -36-\n\fevery employment task for which she had been responsible prior to\n\nher demotion was performed thereafter by an NPP member and that at\n\nleast three new recruits . . . were NPP members.\").\n\n          A defendant, of course, can offer evidence challenging\n\nthe claim that political affiliation played a substantial or\n\nmotivating factor in the adverse employment action.   Additionally,\n\neven if a plaintiff establishes by a preponderance of the evidence\n\nthat political affiliation played a substantial or motivating\n\nfactor in the adverse employment action, a defendant can raise an\n\naffirmative defense specific to this type of case: that is, a\n\ndefendant can attempt \"to prove by a preponderance of the evidence\n\nthat [the] plaintiff [] would have been dismissed regardless of\n\n[his] political affiliation.\" Acevedo-Diaz, 1 F.3d at 66; see also\n\nMt. Healthy, 429 U.S. at 287; Sanchez-Lopez v. Fuentes-Pujols, 375\n\nF.3d 121, 124 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n          In the language of burden-shifting, we have explained the\n\nMt. Healthy affirmative defense as follows:\n\n     [w]e stress that under the Mt. Healthy burden shifting\n     scheme, unlike Title VII cases, the burden of persuasion\n     actually shifts to defendants after plaintiff establishes\n     a prima facie case. Under Title VII, once the plaintiff\n     establishes a prima facie case, the employer need only\n     submit enough evidence to raise a genuine issue of\n     material fact -- i.e., only the burden of production\n     shifts to the employer. However, in a First Amendment\n     political discrimination case, in which the Mt. Healthy\n     scheme is applicable, the burden of persuasion shifts to\n     the defendant, and the plaintiff-employee will prevail\n     unless the fact finder concludes that the defendant has\n     produced   enough   evidence   to   establish   that  the\n\n\n                                 -37-\n\f     plaintiff's dismissal would have occurred in any event\n     for nondiscriminatory reasons.\n\nCepero-Rivera v. Fagundo, 414 F.3d 124, 133 n.1 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(internal citations and quotation marks omitted).\n\nB.   The nature of Plaintiffs' and Defendants' cases\n\n           1.   Plaintiffs' case\n\n           Plaintiffs   presented       an    unusual      case   of   political\n\ndiscrimination.      They   did   not   present      any   evidence     of   overt\n\nstatements of political discrimination.           They also did not present\n\nevidence that employees of their political affiliation had been\n\nreplaced predominantly by employees with an opposing political\n\naffiliation.      Plaintiffs      did   not   even    show    that     their   own\n\nreplacements,   if   any,   had    an   opposing     political    affiliation.\n\nInstead, after showing that Defendants had opposing political\n\naffiliations and had knowledge of their political affiliations,\n\nPlaintiffs focused almost exclusively on the suspicious way they\n\nwere treated by Defendants near the end of their probationary\n\nperiods, and the allegedly spurious reasons supplied by Defendants\n\nfor their failure to survive their respective probationary periods.\n\nPlaintiffs saw in this evidence a circumstantial case of political\n\ndiscrimination.\n\n           2.   Defendants' case\n\n           Aware of the Mt. Healthy line of cases, Defendants\n\npresented a case that also focused on the reasons for Plaintiffs'\n\ndismissal.   In their view, they were attempting to establish that\n\n                                    -38-\n\fregardless of any political discrimination, Plaintiffs' dismissals\n\nwould have occurred anyhow for non-discriminatory reasons.                When\n\nthey renewed their Rule 50(a) motion, Defendants stated that \"[i]t\n\nis   defendant's   [sic]   position   that   we   have   presented   to   the\n\nHonorable Court a strong Mt. Healthy defense.\" Defendants' counsel\n\ncontinued: \"Defendants produced sufficient facts about plaintiffs\n\n[sic] failure to properly perform their duties, and will [sic] have\n\nrendered the same evaluations and will [sic] have taken the same\n\ntermination decision for the reasons that are nondiscriminatory, in\n\nother words, Mt. Healthy defense.\"\n\nC. Vázquez-Valentín and the district court's decision\n\n             In concluding that Plaintiffs had not made the requisite\n\nshowings to get to the jury on their political discrimination\n\nclaims, the district court relied on our Vázquez-Valentín decision.\n\nIn Vázquez-Valentín, the plaintiff attempted to challenge her\n\ndemotion in the wake of a change in political administration by\n\nrelying on some of the typical indicia of political discrimination.\n\nSee generally 385 F.3d at 23.            The defendants in that case\n\n\"reassigned several hundred employees, including [the plaintiff].\"\n\nId. at 35.    The plaintiff asserted that her reassignment to a lower\n\nposition was based on improper political discrimination rather than\n\nthe defendants' claim of a systematic reclassification of existing\n\npositions.     Id. at 28-29.   To demonstrate that the defendants had\n\nknowledge of her political affiliation, the plaintiff referred to\n\n\n                                  -39-\n\fa   single    encounter       during    routine      campaign       canvassing,        and\n\ntestimony about her prior activities and positions under a previous\n\nadministration.            Id. at 37-38.          As to political animus, the\n\nplaintiff offered two comments made by the defendants, id. at 36,\n\n38. The plaintiff also presented evidence about her qualifications\n\nfor   the    job      at    issue,     and    the     gradual      erosion        of   her\n\nresponsibilities when the new administration took charge.\n\n             In     concluding         that        Vázquez-Valentín           presented\n\ninsufficient       evidence     to   get     to    the     jury   on    her   political\n\ndiscrimination claim, we specified the following deficiencies: (1)\n\nshe had not presented evidence creating a reasonable inference that\n\nthe defendants were even aware of her political affiliation when\n\nher personnel file was reviewed and she was reassigned to another\n\nposition; (2) her evidence fell short of proving that she had been\n\ntreated in a discriminatory manner because of undisputed testimony\n\nthat she did not meet the statutory procedural requirements for her\n\npresent position; (3) one of the statements she relied on -- the\n\nmayor's     comment    about    \"cleaning         house\"    --    was   not   a    direct\n\nstatement about NPP employees; (4) her supervisor's statement of\n\npolitical animus was a stray comment that could not be attributed\n\nto the defendant city officials; (5) the actions of her supervisor\n\nin failing to provide her with adequate work for five months\n\nsimilarly could not be attributed to the defendants; and (6)\n\nimportantly, the plaintiff offered no evidence that PDP members\n\n\n                                         -40-\n\fwere    hired    to   replace   the   reassigned      NPP   members.   Vázquez-\n\nValentín, 385 F.3d at 37-40.\n\n            Apparently focusing on these deficiencies, the district\n\ncourt saw Vázquez-Valentín as a baseline for the amount of evidence\n\na political discrimination plaintiff must present in order to reach\n\nthe jury:\n\n       If this case -- if the case of Vázquez-Valentín did not\n       meet the standard of proof for jury submission . . . then\n       this case, that we are trying now . . . doesn't meet it\n       either. . . . The truth of the matter is that the case\n       of Vázquez . . . contained a lot more evidence of\n       potential discriminatory motives and of a circumstantial\n       nature than the one that we are trying.\n\nThe district court's statement is a fair observation as far as it\n\ngoes.     As already noted, there is no evidence in this case of\n\npolitically discriminatory remarks.             There is no evidence of large\n\nscale demotions or firings of the members of one political party.\n\nBut the court's focus on some of the more familiar indicia of\n\npolitical discrimination described in Vázquez-Valentín may have\n\nprevented the district court from recognizing that the evidence of\n\npolitical discrimination presented by Plaintiffs had produced a\n\npolitical discrimination case very different from Vázquez-Valentín.\n\nD.   The sufficiency of the evidence\n\n                A plaintiff must typically make four showings to prove\n\na case of political discrimination: (1) the plaintiff and the\n\ndefendant       belong   to   opposing    political    affiliations;   (2)   the\n\ndefendant has knowledge of the plaintiff's opposing political\n\n\n                                         -41-\n\faffiliation; (3) there is a challenged employment action; and (4)\n\n\"sufficient evidence, whether direct or circumstantial . . . that\n\npolitical affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor . . .\n\nthat the challenged employment action stemmed from politically\n\nbased animus.\"    González-de-Blasini v. Family Dept., 377 F.3d 81,\n\n85-86 (1st Cir. 2004) (internal citations and quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n             Plaintiffs testified, on direct examination, that they\n\nwere   all   affiliated   with   the   NPP.      They   presented   enough\n\ncircumstantial evidence of Santiago and Hernández's affiliation to\n\npermit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that Defendants were\n\naffiliated with the PDP. Plaintiffs proffered testimony that their\n\npolitical affiliations were well-known within the CDA itself, and\n\nHernández, one of the Defendants, asked one of the Plaintiffs to\n\nidentify her political affiliation.           Also, Plaintiffs' evidence\n\nportrays a relatively small workplace where everyone knew who\n\neveryone else was and political affiliations were common office\n\nknowledge.    Given this evidence, a reasonable jury could conclude\n\nthat Defendants knew of Plaintiffs' political affiliations.          There\n\nis no dispute that Plaintiffs were terminated from their career\n\npositions at the end of their probationary periods.\n\n             Therefore, not surprisingly, this appeal turns on the\n\nfourth showing required to prove political discrimination -- that\n\npolitical discrimination was a substantial or motivating factor in\n\n\n                                  -42-\n\fthe challenged employment action.          Before evaluating the evidence\n\non this issue for each Plaintiff, we must make some preliminary\n\npoints applicable to each Plaintiff's case.              We are reviewing a\n\ndistrict court's decision to grant judgment as a matter of law.              As\n\na result, we must evaluate the evidence in the light most favorable\n\nto   the    non-moving    party,   here   Plaintiffs,     and   we    draw   all\n\nreasonable inferences in their favor.             See Figueroa-Torres, 232\n\nF.3d at 273.      We \"may not take into account the credibility of\n\nwitnesses, resolve evidentiary conflicts, nor ponder the weight of\n\nthe evidence introduced at trial.\"          Id.     That is the province of\n\nthe jury.\n\n             Moreover, in political discrimination cases where the\n\ndefendants present evidence of the non-discriminatory               reasons for\n\nthe adverse employment decisions at issue, the falsity of those\n\nreasons     can   provide    circumstantial       evidence   that    political\n\ndiscrimination was a substantial or motivating factor in the\n\nadverse employment decision.       This proposition is well-established\n\nin Title VII law.        In Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc.,\n\n530 U.S. 133 (2000), the Supreme Court stated that \"[p]roof that\n\nthe defendant's explanation is unworthy of credence is simply one\n\nform   of   circumstantial     evidence    that    is   quite   probative     of\n\nintentional discrimination, and it may be quite persuasive . . . .\n\nIn appropriate circumstances, the trier of fact can reasonably\n\ninfer from the falsity of the explanation that the employer is\n\n\n                                    -43-\n\fdissembling to cover up a discriminatory purpose.\"           Id. at 147\n\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted.); see also St.\n\nMary's Honor Center v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 517 (\"[P]roving the\n\nemployer's reason false becomes part of (and often considerably\n\nassists) the greater enterprise of proving that the real reason was\n\nintentional discrimination\"); McDonough v. City of Quincy, 452 F.3d\n\n8, 17 (1st Cir. 2006)(\"Evidence that the defendant's reason was\n\npretext may . . . ground a finding of liability.\"); Fite v Digital\n\nEquipment Corp., 232 F.3d 3, 7 (1st Cir. 2000).          The evidentiary\n\nsignificance of a false explanation for an employment decision is\n\nbased on a general proposition of evidence law.          As the Supreme\n\nCourt explained in Reeves: \"[s]uch an inference [of falsity] is\n\nconsistent with the general principle of evidence law that the\n\nfactfinder is entitled to consider a party's dishonesty about a\n\nmaterial fact as 'affirmative evidence of guilt.'\"          Reeves, 530\n\nU.S. at 147 (emphasis added).      This general proposition applies in\n\nthis case.   However, we are not suggesting that a jury's finding\n\nthat   Defendants   gave   false    explanations   for    their    adverse\n\nemployment decisions would be sufficient alone to establish that\n\npolitical discrimination was a substantial or motivating factor in\n\nthose employment decisions.        We are simply saying that such a\n\nfinding would be circumstantial evidence of such discrimination.\n\n          We may also consider the circumstances surrounding the\n\nadverse employment decisions affecting the Plaintiffs.            Prior to\n\n\n                                   -44-\n\fthe change in administrations, all three Plaintiffs had uneventful\n\nprobationary periods with only positive evaluations.   Their final\n\nevaluations were the only negative marks on their records.   These\n\nfinal evaluations were conducted over a brief period of time -- for\n\nas little as two weeks (Pérez) to four weeks (Gascot), at a time\n\nwhen Santiago and Hernández faced many other demands for their\n\nattention because of the transition in administrations.   Although\n\nnot required to do so, Santiago conceded that he did not take into\n\naccount Plaintiffs' prior, positive evaluations in reaching his\n\ntermination decisions.   Plaintiffs were never admonished for their\n\nalleged performance deficiencies at the time of their occurrences,\n\nand they received their negative evaluations on the day of their\n\nrespective terminations, in contravention of a regulation requiring\n\nthat the termination and final evaluation \"be given to the employee\n\nno less than 10 days before the date of separation.\"\n\n          Again, we are not suggesting that this evidence alone\n\nestablishes that political discrimination was a substantial or\n\nmotivating factor in the adverse employment decision of Defendants.\n\nStill, the three employees who described these strikingly similar\n\nstories were members of the same political party, now out of power.\n\nSee, e.g., Rodríguez-Marín v. Rivera-González, 438 F.3d 72, 80 (1st\n\nCir. 2006) (\"It is suspicious that both of [the NPP plaintiffs]\n\nwere demoted without being given any notice or opportunity to\n\ndefend their promotions, especially since the initial explanation\n\n\n                               -45-\n\foffered for the demotions was simply missing documentation. . . .\n\nFurther, these missing documents mysteriously reappeared after [the\n\nplaintiffs] presented their copies of the missing documents. . . .\n\nEven after the missing documents were replaced, [the plaintiffs]\n\nwere not reinstated; rather, other justifications were given for\n\ntheir demotions.\").\n\n           Importantly, Defendants presented no evidence that they\n\nwere conducting final evaluations of all probationary employees in\n\nthe CDA.    They presented no evidence that these three employees\n\nwere the only probationary employees in the department.            They\n\npresented no evidence that they were engaged in a systematic review\n\nof the personnel files of all employees in search of hiring or\n\npromotion irregularities.     Under the circumstances, a jury could\n\nconclude that the common denominator that explains the strikingly\n\nsimilar    stories   of   Plaintiffs    was   their   shared   political\n\naffiliation.\n\n           Without repeating the summaries of the evidence already\n\npresented, we turn now to a closer examination of the evidence\n\npresented by each Plaintiff, with a particular focus on the points\n\nof conflict in the testimony of the parties.\n\n           1.   Pérez\n\n           In her testimony, Pérez described her job duties and\n\nresponsibilities, said that she performed them well, and noted that\n\nall of her prior evaluations during the probationary period were\n\n\n                                 -46-\n\fpositive. Pérez used a computer in compiling the wage and vacation\n\ninformation for which she was responsible. She said a computer was\n\n\"indispensable . . . to do it efficiently\".                  Hernández painted a\n\ndifferent    picture     of     Pérez's    performance,       stating    that   she\n\nperformed her duties deficiently, committed computational errors,\n\ninsisted    unnecessarily       on   the    use    of   a    computer,    and   was\n\ninsubordinate when told to cease using a particular computer.\n\n            Pérez challenged Hernández's account in several ways. On\n\ncross-examination, Hernández acknowledged that she disregarded a\n\nregulation requiring that a probationary employee receive the last\n\nevaluation ten days before the date of separation.8                Pérez received\n\nher last evaluation on the day of her separation.                        Hernández\n\nadmitted    that   by     not     following       the   applicable       regulation\n\nprescribing   when      evaluations       are   given   to    an   employee,    she\n\nincreased the number of days she had to conduct Pérez's final\n\n\n     8\n       From the trial transcript, we discern that this regulation,\nwhich Hernández described as \"the regulations of essential areas\nand merits, and it establishes the probationary period,\" was\nentered as Defendant's Exhibit Number 10. Paragraph number five\nstated that:\n\n          Any employee can be separated from the position\n     during or at the end of the probationary period after\n     being duly oriented and trained, if it is determined that\n     his progress adaptability to the guidelines in the public\n     service has not been satisfactory.\n\n          The separation must be done through an official\n     communication signed by the secretary, accompanied by the\n     last evaluation. Said communication should be given to\n     the employee no less than 10 days before the date of\n     separation.\n\n                                      -47-\n\fevaluation from two days to twelve days.              With respect to the\n\ncomputational errors attributed to Pérez, Hernández admitted, on\n\nquestioning by the district court, that other employees could have\n\nbeen       responsible   for   Pérez's   errors.     On     cross-examination,\n\nHernández also acknowledged that she exaggerated the severity of\n\nthe consequences of any errors Pérez might have committed in her\n\nwage calculations.        Finally, Hernández admitted that she included\n\nin   her     final   evaluation   alleged   errors   that    would   have   been\n\naccounted for in the November 16 to December 31 evaluation, thereby\n\ninappropriately considering job performance outside of the final\n\nevaluation period.         (Additionally, these prior evaluations were\n\npositive in spite of those errors.)\n\n               In light of these challenges to Hernández's account of\n\nPérez's performance deficiencies, and the responsibility of the\n\njury for assessing the credibility of witnesses, we conclude that\n\na reasonable jury could choose to believe Pérez's account of her\n\nperformance and reject Hernández's account.9\n\n\n\n\n       9\n       There is essentially no credibility contest between Pérez\nand Santiago.   Pérez offered virtually no testimony implicating\nSantiago in her adverse employment action. Her only particularized\nevidence consists of Santiago's testimony that he relied on\nHernández's evaluation of Pérez and approved Hernández's decision\nto dismiss her. Santiago essentially \"rubber-stamped\" Hernández's\ntermination of Pérez.    This is not enough evidence to permit a\nreasonable jury to conclude that political discrimination was a\nsubstantial or motivating factor in Santiago's decision to\nterminate Pérez. We must affirm the court's dismissal of Pérez's\nclaim against Santiago.\n\n                                     -48-\n\f           2.   Negrón\n\n           Much like Pérez, Negrón testified about her job duties\n\nand her satisfactory performance of those duties. Also like Pérez,\n\nNegrón discovered the specific objections to her work at the end of\n\nthe final day of her probationary period, a violation of the ten-\n\nday notice required by the regulation prescribing procedures for\n\nprobationary periods described above.          Negrón also described a\n\nnumber of specific tasks she was asked to perform for Santiago on\n\nhis arrival as CDA Administrator.       The three tasks at issue were:\n\nthe installation of a new door lock for Santiago's office; the\n\nmoving of certain furniture and file cabinets; and the repair of an\n\nair conditioning duct in Santiago's office. Because of the content\n\nof her final probationary evaluation, Negrón anticipated Santiago's\n\nnegative account of her performance of these tasks and provided\n\nexplanations in her direct testimony for the way she performed\n\nthem.   These explanations for her performance were never given\n\ndirectly to Santiago or anyone else at the agency because she was\n\nnever given the opportunity to do so.\n\n           Santiago testified to a starkly different version of\n\nNegrón's   performance   of   these   tasks.     On   cross-examination,\n\nPlaintiffs' counsel challenged the basis for Santiago's objections.\n\nAs to the moving of the furniture and file cabinets, Negrón had\n\nexplained that the furniture and file cabinets were moved as fast\n\nas possible, and that the delay was caused by the lack of personnel\n\n\n                                 -49-\n\fto move the objects.     Santiago conceded that Negrón had to wait for\n\nadditional personnel because she could not have moved the objects\n\non her own.     As to the installation of the lock on Santiago's\n\noffice door, Negrón maintained in her direct testimony that the\n\ntechnician installed the lock improperly despite the specific\n\ninstructions that she provided.          When she was notified of this\n\nerror, she promptly had the lock reinstalled properly.           On cross-\n\nexamination,   Santiago    was   asked    whether   Negrón   ordered   the\n\ntechnician to install the lock backwards.         He admitted, \"I didn't\n\nsay that she did it.\"     Instead, he complained that she should have\n\nchecked the installation when the work was completed.         But he also\n\nconceded that installing a lock is \"not that complex\" and that it\n\nwas not necessary for her to observe the entire installation.          As\n\nto   the   repair   of   the   office's    air   conditioning,    Santiago\n\nacknowledged that the only reason the air conditioning was not\n\nfixed was because he refused to provide the written authorization\n\nrequested by Negrón.     When Plaintiffs' counsel asked Santiago the\n\nreason for his refusal, Santiago said that Negrón's paperwork was\n\n\"redundant\" and it would set a bad precedent.         He never said the\n\nrequest was improper or against CDA policy.\n\n           Based on Negrón's points of contention with Santiago's\n\naccount of her job performance, including the violation of the ten\n\nday requirement, we conclude that a reasonable jury could choose to\n\n\n\n\n                                  -50-\n\fbelieve Negrón's account of her work and reject Santiago's account\n\nas a false explanation.\n\n           3.    Gascot\n\n           Like her fellow Plaintiffs, Gascot described a relatively\n\nuneventful probationary period. She detailed her duties as head of\n\nthe   managerial/entrepreneurial           school    and     recounted    her\n\nsatisfactory performance of those duties, as evidenced by her prior\n\npositive evaluations.       Like Negrón, based on the contents of her\n\nfinal negative evaluation, Gascot anticipated the objections that\n\nSantiago   had   with     the   performance   of    her    duties.   In   his\n\nevaluation, Santiago stated as reasons for Gascot's dismissal:\n\n\"Improper utilization of funds and resources available in the\n\noffering of courses, careless in the effective mantenance of the\n\nvehicle in the school.\"         Later, in response to an interrogatory\n\nrequesting all of the reasons for Gascot's dismissal, Santiago\n\nmentioned only a single reason: her mismanagement of a CDA vehicle.\n\nIn his deposition testimony, he elaborated to some degree on his\n\ndissatisfaction with Gascot's job performance.               He referred to\n\nGascot's mishandling of the CDA vehicle; he said that the school's\n\n\"courses were ineffective\"; and he said that Gascot \"did not have\n\nan organized working plan for the school.\"           On direct examination\n\nat trial, Santiago significantly expanded on the deficiencies in\n\nGascot's performance, listing a number of other \"plans\" that Gascot\n\nhad failed to produce, including a \"capacitation plan,\" a \"study of\n\n\n                                    -51-\n\fneeds,\"   and    a   \"promotional   advertising     plan.\"      On    cross-\n\nexamination, Santiago admitted that his answer to the interrogatory\n\nhad not included many of the problems with Gascot's performance\n\nthat he was now describing.\n\n           Curiously,      when   Defendants'    counsel     cross-examined\n\nGascot, he permitted her to testify that she had prepared a\n\ntraining and service plan for the school and had submitted it as\n\npart of transition procedures to Santiago. Moreover, Gascot stated\n\nin response to that same cross-examination that Santiago \"had no\n\ncriteria for rendering\" his negative evaluation because \"[h]e did\n\nnot meet with me and ask for the plan.          He did not ask me for the\n\nstudy or the research of needs.       He didn't . . . [say] let's see\n\nwhere are the studies.      If he had asked me I would have given them\n\nall to him and would have avoided all of this.\"\n\n           On cross-examination, Santiago admitted to receiving a\n\ntransition report, introduced into evidence by Plaintiff's counsel,\n\nwhich included a document that Santiago identified as a \"working\n\nplan\" for the school, though he claimed to have never seen that\n\nworking   plan   before.     This   exchange    suggested    that    Santiago\n\ncriticized Gascot for her failure to plan, yet he had received a\n\ndocument from her reflecting such planning. Additionally, Santiago\n\nconceded that while he criticized Gascot for not updating the\n\nentrepreneurial school's curriculum, that curriculum had remained\n\nunchanged at the time of Santiago's departure from the CDA one year\n\n\n                                    -52-\n\flater, well after Gascot's departure.           Also, he acknowledged that\n\nthe contents of the transition report he received called into\n\nquestion Santiago's claim that the disrepair of the CDA vehicle was\n\ncaused by Gascot's neglect because the vehicle was already old when\n\nGascot assumed her responsibilities.\n\n            Because of these challenges to Santiago's account of\n\nGascot's performance, we conclude that a reasonable jury could\n\nchoose to believe Gascot's account of her performance and reject\n\nSantiago's account as a false explanation.\n\n            4.   Summary\n\n            In     essence,    Plaintiffs     described   satisfactory   job\n\nperformances throughout their probationary periods until the new\n\nadministration arrived with a different political affiliation.\n\nThen they received negative evaluations based on a limited period\n\nof observation.      Those negative evaluations were presented to them\n\non the last day of their probationary periods when they were\n\nterminated from their positions, in violation of a regulation\n\nrequiring that such evaluations be presented to the probationary\n\nemployees    ten     days     before   separation.   In   their   testimony,\n\nDefendants explained the deficiencies in the job performance of\n\nPlaintiffs justifying these adverse employment decisions.            In both\n\ntheir direct testimony, which anticipated some of the explanations\n\nby Defendants, and in cross-examination of Defendants, Plaintiffs\n\nchallenged the authenticity of these accounts.            In the presence of\n\n\n                                       -53-\n\fthis    conflicting      testimony,      a     reasonable      jury   could        believe\n\nPlaintiffs and disbelieve Defendants. As we have already explained,\n\nthe    fact   that   a   jury   could    find     that    Defendants        gave    false\n\nexplanations has evidentiary significance. See Reeves, 530 U.S. at\n\n147 (stating that \"the factfinder is entitled to consider a party's\n\ndishonesty about a material fact as 'affirmative evidence of\n\nguilt'\").\n\n              However,    Plaintiffs         cannot   establish       their    case       of\n\npolitical      discrimination         solely     by   persuading       a    jury     that\n\nDefendants' explanations were false. Plaintiffs have the burden of\n\nestablishing     specifically         that    political     discrimination          was    a\n\nsubstantial or motivating factor for the adverse employment action.\n\nSee Acevedo-Diaz, 1 F.3d at 66.                On this issue, there was other\n\nrelevant evidence that a jury could consider to supplement a jury\n\nfinding of false explanations for the adverse employment decisions.\n\n              These three dismissals all happened within one month of\n\na change in political administrations.                    The temporal proximity\n\nbetween a change in political administrations and an adverse\n\nemployment action is relevant to the issue of whether political\n\naffiliation was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse\n\nemployment     decision.        See    Acevedo-Diaz,       1   F.3d    at     69   (\"Mere\n\ntemporal proximity between a change of administration and a public\n\nemployee's dismissal is insufficient to establish discriminatory\n\nanimus\" (emphasis added).).             Moreover, a jury could conclude that\n\n\n                                         -54-\n\fit was more than coincidence that the three probationary employees\n\nwho lost their jobs were members of the same political party now\n\nout of power.      For unexplained reasons, these three employees\n\nbecame the focus of hurried evaluations that, in some important\n\nrespects, did not conform to the regulations for such evaluations\n\nof probationary employees.       These hurried evaluations gave the\n\nappearance of a coordinated effort to rid the agency of three\n\nemployees who shared a different political affiliation than the\n\nparty now in power.\n\n           Under these circumstances, a reasonable fact finder could\n\nconclude   that     Plaintiffs   have    established   that   political\n\ndiscrimination was a substantial or motivating factor in the loss\n\nof their jobs.    Therefore, it was an error of law for the court to\n\ngrant Defendants' second Rule 50(a) motion and keep from the jury\n\nPérez's claim against Hernández, and the claims of Negrón and\n\nGascot against Santiago.\n\n           In summary, we affirm the district court's dismissal of\n\nPérez's claim against Santiago. We vacate its dismissal of Pérez's\n\nclaim against Hernández, and the claims of Negrón and Gascot\n\nagainst Santiago.    Each party is to bear its own costs.\n\n           So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -55-\n\f",

The jury trial began on September 20, 2004. At the close of Plaintiffs' case on September 21, 2004, Defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law under Fed. R.Civ.P. 50(a), asserting that Plaintiffs had not presented sufficient evidence to reach the jury on their case of political discrimination. Specifically, Defendants argued that Plaintiffs had not demonstrated that their political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor in their terminations. The district court granted Defendants' Rule 50(a) motion in part and denied it in part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) All claims against Vilma Jim&#233;nez (\"Jim&#233;nez\"), Director of Human Resources and Legal Services, were dismissed;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) The claims brought by Maribel Negr&#243;n-Almeda (\"Negr&#243;n\") and Aracelis Gascot-Cuadrado (\"Gascot\") against Susana Hern&#225;ndez Colon (\"Hern&#225;ndez\"), a Human Resources Officer, were dismissed;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) The First Amendment claim of Nilda P&#233;rez-Montalvo (\"P&#233;rez\") against Hern&#225;ndez survived;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(4) The First Amendment claims of all of the Plaintiffs against Carlos Gabriel Santiago (\"Santiago\"), Administrator of the CDA, survived.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the close of their case on September 27, 2004, Defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law a second time on the remaining claims, on essentially the same grounds as their first Rule 50(a) motion. Ruling from the bench that same day, the district court granted Defendants' motion. In presenting their renewed Rule 50(a) motion, Defendants relied heavily on our decision in <i>V&#225;zquez-Valent&#237;n,</i> which was published during the trial. It is also apparent from the record that the district court reviewed <i>V&#225;zquez-Valent&#237;n</i> during the noon break between the morning session of the trial&#8212;when Defendants made their second Rule 50(a) motion&#8212;and the afternoon session when the district court ruled on the motion. The district court explained its reading of the import of <i>V&#225;zquez-Valent&#237;n</i> in these terms:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If this case&#8212;if the case of <i>V&#225;zquez-Valentin</i> did not meet the standard of proof for jury submission as to the fact of whether political discrimination was a substantial or motivating factor in the challenged employment action, then this case, that we are trying now, the one that is before us, doesn't meet it, either.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The truth of the matter is that the case of <i>V&#225;zquez</i> . . . contained a lot more evidence of potential discriminatory motives and of a circumstantial nature than the one that we are trying.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So under those circumstances, it seems to me that I don't see how I can let this case go to the jury.... I recognize, and I know, on the basis of my experience, that when these things happen in the context of positions like this, usually you have to look carefully, because there is always the good possibility that improper political motives were behind the personnel action. But it is not what I think; it is what the evidence sustains.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And obviously, the problem that I have here is that there is no evidence other than a scintilla of evidence to let this case go to a jury, and this case [<i>V&#225;zquez-Valent&#237;n</i>] is extremely clear as to what is required. And the case before me doesn't satisfy the standard. ....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So on the basis of that, I have no other alternative but to disregard my own feelings as to what the case is and enter a judgment under Rule 50, dismissing it on the basis of insufficiency of evidence on the issue of political discrimination under this case of <i>V&#225;zquez v. Santiago</i> [sic]. No other alternative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs read this ruling as reflecting the district court's focus on the evidence in their case only and a disregard of the evidence presented by Defendants. If, in fact, the district court examined only the evidence presented in Plaintiffs' case when granting Defendants' renewed Rule 50(a) motion, this would be an error of law. <i>See</i> 9A Wright &amp; Miller, <i>Federal Practice</i> <i>and Procedure, Civil 2d</i> &#167; 2534 (2d ed. 1994) (\"A renewed [Rule 50(a)(1)] motion will be judged in the light of the case as it stands at that time.\"); <i>Potti v. Duramed Pharms, Inc.,</i> 938 F.2d 641, 645 (6th Cir. 1991) (\"Our review of whether there was [sufficient] evidence [to survive judgment as a matter of law] . . . must be based on the entire record, not just the record at the end of plaintiffs' case, because [the defendant] proceeded to offer evidence in its own defense.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Plaintiffs' reading of the district court's ruling is plausible, Defendants advance an equally plausible reading&#8212;the district court evaluated all of the evidence adduced during the trial when it announced its bench ruling. For example, in an exchange with defense counsel concerning the renewed Rule 50(a) motion, the district court insisted \"[r]emember, I wanted the [sic] hear the evidence as a whole.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, we need not decide which characterization of the district court's ruling is accurate. Even if the district court had unambiguously focused only on Plaintiffs' evidence&#8212;and hence had committed an error of law by disregarding Defendants' evidence when ruling on the renewed Rule 50(a) motion&#8212;we could not rule in Plaintiffs' favor if, in fact, the totality of the evidence did not permit their case to go to the jury. We engage in <i>de novo</i> review of the district court's decision granting judgment as a matter of law. <i>See Webber v. Int'l Paper Co.,</i> 417 F.3d 229, 233 (1st Cir.2005). We can affirm on any basis available in the record because \"[w]e are not wedded to the lower court's rationale, but, rather, may affirm its order on any independent ground made manifest by the record.\" <i>InterGen N.V. v. Grina</i> 344 F.3d 134, 141 (1st Cir.2003). Therefore, the dispositive question on appeal is whether, in light of the totality of the evidence, the district court correctly ruled that there was insufficient evidence of political discrimination to permit the Plaintiffs' case to go to the jury. To pursue this inquiry, and to provide an adequate basis for explaining our decision, we must first set forth in some detail the evidence adduced at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 7, 2000, general elections were held in Puerto Rico. The Popular Democratic Party's (\"PDP\") candidate for governor won that election, leading to a change of administration from the incumbent New Progressive Party (\"NPP\") to the PDP. Defendant Santiago was appointed Administrator of the CDA on or about January 7, 2001. As such, he was in charge of all of the CDA's operations. At the time of the change in regime, Defendant Hern&#225;ndez served as a Human Resources Officer and Officer of Labor Relations, meaning that she carried out hiring and termination decisions and managed payroll, with Santiago's approval. Plaintiff P&#233;rez worked in the human resources department of the CDA, where she maintained attendance and payroll records. Plaintiff Negr&#243;n served as the director of the general services division. She was responsible for supervising the maintenance of the CDA's physical plant and equipment, obtaining supplies, and providing support for the vehicles and equipment of her division. Plaintiff Gascot was director of the CDA's management and entrepreneurial school. Her duties included managing the school's equipment and physical resources, budgeting, and planning the school's curriculum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Within three to four weeks after the change of administration in early January 2001, all of the Plaintiffs had lost their jobs at the CDA. Plaintiffs' case consisted almost entirely of descriptions of what happened to them in those three to four weeks, and the circumstances of their terminations from the CDA. Defendants' case consisted entirely of explanations of why they were justified in terminating Plaintiffs. Although the trial lasted six days, and included other witnesses,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> we summarize only the testimony of the three Plaintiffs and the two remaining Defendants. For the testimony of each of the Plaintiffs&#8212;P&#233;rez, Negr&#243;n, and Gascot&#8212;we divide the summary of their testimony into three sections: (1) before the change of administration; (2) after the change of administration; and (3) political affiliation testimony. Then we summarize the testimony of Defendants&#8212;Santiago and Hern&#225;ndez&#8212;with Santiago's testimony related as it pertains to each of the three Plaintiffs; and Hern&#225;ndez's related only as it pertains to Plaintiff P&#233;rez. As noted earlier, the First Amendment claims of each of the three Plaintiffs against Santiago survived Defendants' first Rule 50(a) motion. But only P&#233;rez's claim against Hern&#225;ndez survived that same motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Plaintiffs</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1.

She worked in government for about nine years before leaving to raise her children. At the time she left, she served as an economist at the Statistics Bureau in the Department of Labor. After her children matured, she decided to return to work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">She returned to work first in the private sector at a temporary employment services company, Top Notch. Top Notch told her to apply for a vacant secretarial position in the CDA administrator's office, which she obtained. While working in the administrator's office, P&#233;rez applied for and obtained a career position in the CDA's human resources office.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">P&#233;rez stated that her first task in her position in the human resources department was to update the time cards of all CDA employees, which had fallen behind since her predecessor's departure in December 1999. She was \"supposed to check the time cards, the weekly time cards, that all the employees had to punch and check to see if they had worked every day, if they had not worked every day. See if they had taken leave . . . . In other words, I was supposed to record their attendance on a weekly basis.\" P&#233;rez testified that she performed this work, at least initially, on an adding machine, which her predecessor had done, despite her knowledge of computer programs and usage. Subsequently, she began to use a computer to do her work. She stated that the attendance records were current up to December 2000 at the time of her termination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a probationary employee, P&#233;rez was subject to periodic evaluations of her performance during the probationary period, which spanned from July 15, 2000 to January 15, 2001. She was evaluated three times prior to Santiago's appointment as head of the CDA for the following time periods: (1) July 15, 2000 to September 15, 2000; September 18, 2000 to November 15, 2000; and (3) November 16, 2000 to December 31, 2000. These prior evaluations, all of which were positive, were signed by Margarita Martinez, who was the director of the human resources department for this period (and replaced by Jim&#233;nez when the administration changed). However, P&#233;rez understood that Hern&#225;ndez, not Martinez, was her immediate supervisor, although P&#233;rez was never officially told this.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b.

She was evaluated by Hern&#225;ndez, her superior in the human resources office. However, P&#233;rez also stated that, during those fifteen days, she and Hern&#225;ndez were actually in the office at the same time for only six and a half days because of weekends and holidays. On this final written evaluation, Hern&#225;ndez had written that P&#233;rez was not receptive to instructions, unreliable, and \"rarely willing to collaborate.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No one reviewed P&#233;rez's final evaluation with her. Also, P&#233;rez never received any verbal admonishment or reprimand for the various mistakes reported on the final evaluation. The written evaluation was handed to her on her final day at the CDA, which was January 12, 2001.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross-examination, defense counsel questioned P&#233;rez's testimony that she had never been verbally reprimanded for errors she committed in her work. Defense counsel also asked about the details of those instances of error. P&#233;rez claimed that she had no recollection of having committed any errors. Defense counsel also questioned P&#233;rez regarding the necessity of using a computer to complete the tasks assigned to her. P&#233;rez contended that a computer was necessary to perform her tasks \"efficiently\".</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c.

During election years, she had attended party meetings. Although P&#233;rez testified that she knew Hern&#225;ndez's political affiliation, she never explicitly identified that affiliation for the court. As to Santiago, P&#233;rez knew that he was the new appointee for Administrator of the CDA for the incoming PDP administration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regarding Defendants' knowledge of her political affiliation, P&#233;rez stated that her affiliation with the NPP was widely known at the CDA. Politics was openly discussed at the office, particularly during the 2000 election year, and she was \"very open about [her] affiliation .... When [she] obtained the position in the human resources office [she] spoke with [her] fellow co-workers there about [her] political affiliation.\" Just before the 2000 elections, she stated that she had left to attend an NPP meeting during her lunch hour and all of her co-workers saw her leave. While P&#233;rez never directly discussed politics with Hern&#225;ndez, she believed that Hern&#225;ndez knew her political affiliation because there were only six people in her office at the CDA. In her prior position in the CDA administrator's office, all of the employees were affiliated with the NPP, and she \"didn't hide [her affiliation] because [she] didn't have reason to.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2.

After obtaining her degree she began work in the private sector, where she worked until she married and left the workforce for a time. After that break, she began working at the CDA shortly before the change in administration. Her position, a career position, had a six-month probationary period from August 1, 2000 to January 31, 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Negr&#243;n testified that she was evaluated three times prior to Santiago's arrival at the CDA for the following time periods: (1) August 1, 2000 to September 30, 2000; (2) October 1, 2000 to November 30, 2000; and (3) December 1, 2000 to December 31, 2000. Juan Matos Gonzalez, Negr&#243;n's supervisor and the auxiliary superintendent of the CDA prior to the change in administration, performed these evaluations, all of which were positive. Gonzalez occupied a trust position and tendered his resignation effective December 31, 2000. To Negr&#243;n's knowledge, no one was appointed to replace him following Santiago's arrival.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b.

One incident involved changing the locks on the door of Santiago's office. According to Negr&#243;n, Santiago's secretary instructed her to have the lock installed a certain way, and Negr&#243;n contacted the appropriate company and conveyed these instructions. However, the technician installed the lock incorrectly. \"The following day [Negr&#243;n] was told there was a problem. [She] once more called the company. The company came back and they once more reinstalled the lock.\" The only verbal admonishment Negr&#243;n acknowledged \"had to do with [this incident]. That was the wrong way.

Negr&#243;n testified that once she received the requests from Santiago, she attempted to contact the two employees who performed these duties; however, the position for one of those employees was vacant, and the other employee was \"quite old[,] and those file cabinets weighed approximately 100 pounds.\" She informed Santiago of the problem, but told him that she would ask two other employees to do the moving. Because these two employees were not specifically tasked with this type of work, they had to coordinate schedules to find a time that would work, which caused a delay in the moving of the cabinets. To Negr&#243;n's recollection, Santiago was pleased with the work that was done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Negr&#243;n also recalled Santiago asking her \"to have an air conditioner duct moved which was in his office.\" She \"coordinated with the company that had the air conditioning contract . . . [and] received the estimate for the work.\" However, that work was never carried out while Negr&#243;n was at the CDA \"because [Santiago] never signed the authorization for [her].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On her final evaluation, for the period from January 9, 2001 to January 31, 2001, Santiago gave her failing marks. In the written evaluation Negr&#243;n received, Santiago stated that Negr&#243;n had ignored his instructions and performed tasks carelessly and negligently. The evaluation contained similar comments about her cooperativeness. Negr&#243;n stated that Santiago never discussed his negative evaluation with her. Negr&#243;n testified that Santiago gave the evaluation to her at the end of the work day on January 31, 2001, her final day at the CDA, and informed her that she did not pass her probationary period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross-examination, defense counsel questioned Negr&#243;n's account of her performance of the tasks requested by Santiago. Specifically, he asked her: whether the furniture and file cabinets were moved on the same day that she was told to have them moved; for more details as to why the air conditioner was never installed; and whether the lock had been installed improperly because she conveyed inaccurate instructions to the technician. Negr&#243;n responded that: any delay in moving furniture and file cabinets was caused by unavoidable logistical issues, and the objects were moved as fast as possible; the air conditioner was not installed because Santiago never gave proper written authorization; and the improper installation was the result of an error by the technician (rather than an error in her instructions) that was corrected as soon as was possible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c.

Negr&#243;n stated that she knew the political affiliation of Santiago: \"[D]uring the few times that I was able to talk to him he would stress that he enjoyed the full trust of the governor and he would always say that he enjoyed a position of trust because he had the governor's trust, so I understood that he had&#8212;he was affiliated to that party [PDP].\" In particular, Negr&#243;n recalled Santiago raising this issue of political affiliation when he asked her to change the car that had been assigned to him at the CDA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for Defendants' knowledge of her political affiliation, Negr&#243;n believed that her affiliation was known at the CDA because \"the elections were already approaching by that time.... [I]n my area people would talk. . . . We would talk about who would win and who would lose . . . . We would talk and you would talk about who you felt was going to win and everybody just knew your party.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3.

Employment history before Santiago's arrival</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gascot had a bachelor's degree in business administration, with a focus on secondary education, and a master's degree in administration and supervision of schools. She worked as a teacher in a number of high schools, and then later in a superintendent's office until 1993 when she began working in the CDA as the entrepreneurial director, which at that time was categorized as an \"Assistant II\" position. She worked in this position for seven years. In the spring of 2000, Gascot became aware of a posting, dated April 14, 2000, for the position of director of the CDA's management and entrepreneurial school, a career position. She applied for and obtained this position, which had an \"eight-month probation period [and] I was to have evaluations every two months ... the first evaluation undertaken from June the 1st to July the 31st. The first of the first two months of work.\" The probation period would end on January 31, 2001. Gascot's duties included managing the school's equipment and physical resources, budgeting, and planning the school's curriculum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Within that eight-month period, Gascot was evaluated for the following time periods: (1) June 1, 2000 to July 31, 2000; (2) August 1, 2000 to September 30, 2000; (3) October 1, 2000 to November 30, 2000; and (4) December 1, 2000 to December 31, 2000. These evaluations were performed by Gonzalez. Gascot received all positive evaluations. After Gonzalez's departure following the change in administration, Gascot was not informed of anyone taking Gonzalez's position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. Employment history following Santiago's arrival and alleged employment deficiencies</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aside from a general, agency-wide meeting where he was introduced to the CDA as the newly-appointed administrator on January 9, Gascot recalled only \"one occasion in which [she] met personally with Santiago,\" which occurred on January 14 or 15. On that occasion she went to his office: \"[a] group of employees was dismissed [from their jobs] and he asked me to explain to him regarding an aid program for them. I explained to him what the program was about, and what was normally done.\" Gascot stated that Santiago never discussed the nature of her work at the CDA and never conducted any evaluation of the program she directed. Gascot testified that \"during the transitionary period a report was made for the work performed at the school and it stated the amount of participants which had increased and the working plan.\" While it is unclear from the record whether Gascot prepared this report herself, Gascot stated that Santiago never requested from her either statistics about the school or that working plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On her final evaluation, for the period from January 1 to January 31, Gascot noted that as to her planning, organization, and performance, Santiago had written the same thing: \"improper utilization of funds and resources available in the offering of courses, careless in the effective maintenance of the vehicle assigned to the school.\" Gascot testified that this \"evaluation was not discussed with me at any time\" and \"was given to me on January 31, 2001. That was the date that ended my probation period.\" On January 31, Gascot was told not to leave work that day without going to the administrator's office. She went to the administrator's office at 5:10 pm, where she was handed a letter that read, in part: \"[i]n view of the above, effective today, January 31, 2001, you are being separated from the position you have been occupying at the agency. If you are not in agreement with this decision you are entitled to discuss it within the next ten days with the personnel administration.\" Gascot stated that \"[w]hen the document was given to me and I was about to talk ... [Defendant] Ms. Vilma Gim&#233;nez [sic] tells me that that [sic] is not the forum for me to talk.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Gascot, it was only later, through Santiago's deposition, that she learned why Santiago had given her such a negative final evaluation. Gascot recalled that Santiago had \"said that [she] had been assigned a mobile unit [truck] ... [which] was deteriorated and [she] had used it wrongly and it was not well used and there were badly used funds.\" To Gascot's knowledge, the vehicle was purchased by a prior administrator in 1995 or 1996 for the CDA. It was her understanding that \"[a]ll agency vehicles are under the General Services Administration. They are the ones who provide maintenance of the vehicles.\" Gascot claimed that she never used the vehicle during her time as director of the managerial school. Gascot also learned through Santiago's deposition that rumors came to him from other business centers and business people that the courses were \"inefficient\" and \"nonoperative,\" but he could not recall the names of anyone from whom he heard these rumors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross-examination, Gascot again testified that she believed that the agency vehicle for which Santiago held her responsible was, in fact, \"the responsibility of the general services department,\" which, as of August 2000, was run by Negr&#243;n.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. Political affiliations</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gascot stated that she was affiliated with the NPP, and had been since she first voted forty (40) years ago. She participated in ladies' groups, political reelection groups, and professional agencies. She also belonged to an NPP group comprised of CDA employees that met outside of working hours. During the 2000 election, Gascot participated in municipal campaigns, and served as an election functionary, checking voter lists. Gascot testified that she knew the political affiliations of both Hern&#225;ndez and Santiago&#8212;they were both members of the PDP. As to Hern&#225;ndez, Gascot stated that Hern&#225;ndez \"had been working [at the CDA] for many years. She has held high posts within her town. She's also worked within her political party and it is known throughout all the [CDA] employees that she belongs to the Popular Democratic Party.\" As to Santiago, Gascot testified that \"when he came to the [CDA] he came from COFEC [Corporation for the Economic Development of the Capital City].... It was a department within the municipality of San Juan created when Sila Maria Calderon [the new PDP governor] was there.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gascot testified that her affiliation was known at the CDA because she first arrived at the CDA as a special aide under an NPP administration, a trust position. Gascot recalled specifically that Hern&#225;ndez had direct knowledge of her affiliation. Gascot recalled an incident when she first started working as the director of the managerial school. Hern&#225;ndez, who Gascot identified as the \"institutional brain\" of the CDA, asked her to identify her political affiliation. By \"institutional brain,\" Gascot understood Hern&#225;ndez to be an individual who \"dedicate[s] themselves to identify[ing] the [political affiliation of the] people when they come in.\" Hern&#225;ndez was \"the person who knows everybody in there.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Defendants</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Carlos Gabriel Santiago</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before being appointed as head of the CDA, Santiago was appointed the executive president of COFEC, \"a corporation of economic development for the capital city [of Puerto Rico]. It is a development company which gives loans to small businesses in San Juan and also other municipalities in the island.\" He was appointed by COFEC's board of twelve directors. He became administrator of the CDA on January 7, 2001, and he \"stopped being the director in January 2002.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. P&#233;rez</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Santiago acknowledged that Hern&#225;ndez made the final decision on P&#233;rez's retention of her position following her probationary period, he stated that Hern&#225;ndez had consulted with him. Hern&#225;ndez told him that she \"wasn't satisfied with the inefficient way that P&#233;rez was performing the task of her job, and [Hern&#225;ndez] understood that [P&#233;rez] wasn't going to fulfill the expectations of the position.\" Santiago ultimately endorsed Hern&#225;ndez's dismissal of P&#233;rez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross-examination by Plaintiff's counsel, Santiago conceded that prior to P&#233;rez's termination, Santiago did not speak to her to discuss his intentions to terminate her. He admitted that he did not remember if Hern&#225;ndez had told him about P&#233;rez's educational qualifications or the fact that P&#233;rez's position had been vacant for six months prior to her filling that position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. Negr&#243;n</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago stated that he got to know Negr&#243;n and that \"her performance was low, very low ... more than poor. It was just bad.\" He testified that he gave her instructions to move furniture and file cabinets, change locks, and repair air conditioners. As to the moving of furniture and file cabinets, he stated that he gave Negr&#243;n the instruction personally, but she did not comply. Moreover, Santiago stated that Negr&#243;n misplaced the file cabinets \"because it was more than an issue of instructions or permission. It was more of [Negr&#243;n] started establishing territory in the agency.... So it was more of hostility to me.\" He stated that the file cabinets were misplaced and Negr&#243;n's reaction was simply \"[t]hat there was no space anywhere else except in my office.\" On another occasion involving the moving of files, according to Santiago, it \"took a few days, three or four days, because the argument was the same: There was no space, so those had to remain there.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the counter/desk, Santiago stated that Negr&#243;n \"counterordered\" the moving of the counter from a location preferred by Santiago. He felt \"concerned and even pressured psychologically because the situation was more than just me saying things one way and things happening another. And it was more of a controversy.\" As to the air conditioning duct, Santiago confirmed that the air conditioning in his office was never repaired. He also confirmed that the reason \"was that the order had to be in writing.\" However, Santiago testified that he thought this was unreasonable. \"[Negr&#243;n] insisted that every task that she was ordered to do, even if it was the simplest of tasks, had to be in writing ... it wasn't enough that it had to be [in] a memorandum for [Negr&#243;n], but it also had to be&#8212;the requisition had to be signed .... the process was done twice for whatever was needed.\" According to him, he asked Negr&#243;n three times to fix the air conditioning duct, and it was never done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the installation of a new lock on his office door, Santiago recalled that he was in his office when it was installed. After the installation, when he went to leave, \"the lock [was] installed inside out, meaning that the lock that has the key is on the inside, and on the outside is the part where you can do it manually.... And so I am locked in my office. I am trapped.\" His specific complaint was that Negr&#243;n did not remain to supervise the installation of the lock. In his opinion, with the lock incident as an exemplar, \"it was impossible to articulate a particular operational plan with [Negr&#243;n] because, if things this simple could not be solved and saying that this was simply a mistake ... it was something that would concern any supervisor .... it even got to the point in my mind that I concluded that, if ever there was a person that was not going to cooperate . . . it was [Negr&#243;n].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On his final evaluation of Negr&#243;n, regarding the \"performance\" factor, Santiago stated that Negr&#243;n \"did not meet the goals and objectives, be them small as they could be, and also the effective solutions of unforeseen situations like the one regarding the lock.... It shouldn't be the duty of a director to constantly be in controversy with the head of an agency. It [was her duty] to keep in operational conditions the physical facilities of the agency, which [Negr&#243;n] did not perform, did not do.\" As to the \"cooperation\" factor, \"[Negr&#243;n] didn't have the appropriate attitude. It was more of a serious problem in terms of personality in terms of trying to be in controversy all the time. And also to collaborate ... that never happened.... And to obtain the maximum effort from the personnel. [Negr&#243;n] never complied with this. On the contrary, she prevented things from happening.\" According to Santiago, the period from January 9 to January 31 was \"more than enough\" time to observe Negr&#243;n's performance. He treated this stretch of time as 20 days.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross-examination, Santiago revised this number of days for observing Negr&#243;n to 16. He also admitted that his office was isolated from Negr&#243;n's (a floor away) such that he only observed her when the two had direct interaction. Santiago conceded that one of the pieces of furniture that he requested be moved, a counter, was something that Negr&#243;n could not move on her own. As to the lock, Plaintiffs' counsel asked, among other things, why Santiago did not prevent the incorrect installation of the lock since he was in his office when it was installed. Santiago stated that he was occupied with work and that the door was actually some distance from his desk. As to the air conditioning problem, Plaintiffs' counsel asked Santiago whether it was in fact reasonable policy for Negr&#243;n to have written authorization for work done in order to keep a record for accounting purposes, and because checks were issued by a separate department of the CDA. Santiago replied that Negr&#243;n's paperwork \"was additional,\" meaning redundant. Plaintiffs' counsel also questioned Santiago as to the difficulty of completing Negr&#243;n's paperwork (essentially, writing \"Approved\"). Santiago responded that it would set a problematic precedent, requiring signatures for everything.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Gascot</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago stated that he had an opportunity to evaluate Gascot's performance, which he described as \"`poor,' that it did not meet the standard.\" He claimed that as far as planning, coordinating, and directing the entrepreneurial school, Gascot \"peformed duties that were more of a routine, more of a day-to-day operational basis and instead of planning and coordinating and looking to the future, that effort did not exist.\" As to the agency vehicle in dispute, Santiago stated that Gascot \"and I had had our differences in how to use the mobile truck to the entrepreneurial school, the fact that it had been abandoned in the parking lot of the agency to be deteriorated.\" He testified that the vehicle was assigned to the entrepreneurial school; the funds for it came from the entrepreneurial school; and the side of the vehicle said \"Commercial Development, Entrepreneurial School.\" Santiago identified documents confirming the disrepair of the vehicle, dated December 28, 2000 and January 11, 2001. Additionally, auditors from the controller's office requested documents and information from Negr&#243;n regarding the purchase, maintenance, and future use of the agency vehicle in question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago stated that he believed that no one in the CDA wanted to be responsible for the vehicle&#8212;\"[t]he entrepreneurial school said it was from general services, and general services said it belonged to the entrepreneurial school.\" In summary, Santiago expected Gascot \"[t]o assume responsibility, to assume responsibility for things that are under her direct supervision ... [b]ut that didn't even happen.\" Santiago also claimed that he \"never saw [an] annual plan [for training services] from\" Gascot. He continued \"I honestly think that ... Gascot didn't have the capacity to prepare such a plan.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago also testified that Gascot failed to develop or propose a number of plans: a \"capacitation plan\" for communication between the central school in San Juan and centers throughout the island; \"a study of needs ... to develop a study determining the needs for training which is offered to businessmen\"; a \"promotion advertising plan\" for \"what was going to be published in the advertisements.\" Additionally, he criticized Gascot for allowing \"the course of offering of the entrepreneurial school [to] become obsolete or inefficient in terms to what the businessmen wanted.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago claimed that he spoke to Gascot about all of these failures, but she gave her \"usual response, that she didn't give me a clue&#8212;or she didn't give me any way that I could believe that she was going to be in charge of that, that she would take care of it.\" He conceded that \"[c]ertainly there were other issues\" on his mind during the transition period, but that he devoted \"from five to 10 hours\" to the entrepreneurial school and Gascot. He stated that he \"saw the [prior] evaluations in the file, but those evaluations were not in agreement with what [he] saw ... of Gascot's work performance.\" He performed the final evaluation of Gascot with the help of Hern&#225;ndez and Jim&#233;nez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross-examination, Santiago admitted that his office was a number of floors away from that of Gascot, and he only observed her when the two had direct interaction. He also identified a transition report that was given to him on his arrival at the CDA, which stated that the agency vehicle for which Gascot was responsible was purchased from \"General Services by Commercial Development Services\" and that the vehicle was already eight years old when it was purchased, meaning it was twelve years old when Santiago first saw it. Santiago also conceded that evaluations of an employee's probationary period should only take into account actions performed during that period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' counsel also questioned Santiago about an apparent inconsistency between his testimony on direct examination and his response to an interrogatory prior to trial. The interrogatory had asked for any and all reasons for dismissing Gascot; Santiago listed and explained only the vehicle incident. He did not mention any inability to engage in planning. Santiago also stated that, even though he was an accountant, he did not check the agency's property ledger to determine, ultimately, who was responsible for the vehicle, but that he \"must have sent somebody to check it.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under further questioning from Plaintiffs' counsel, Santiago identified a 2000/2001 work plan for the entrepreneurial school, but stated that he had never seen the document. He also conceded that when he left the CDA a year after becoming its administrator, the courses being offered by the entrepreneurial school had not changed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Susana Hern&#225;ndez Colon</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hern&#225;ndez's testimony focused only on P&#233;rez.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> On direct examination, Hern&#225;ndez testified to a number of instances where P&#233;rez \"worked [] attendance sheets without being duly authorized by the immediate supervisor ... meaning that the agency would pay employees that had not been working.\" However, on questioning by the district court as to whether \"somebody else could have been at fault,\" Hern&#225;ndez conceded that it was possible \"that more than one person may have been involved in this negligence.\" Hern&#225;ndez also recounted incidents where she directly asked P&#233;rez to review the vacation (\"leave\") records of certain employees, including some outgoing ones. According to Hern&#225;ndez, P&#233;rez committed errors on these types of records as well, the consequence being that \"we would have paid the employee less days when the employee would have had a right to be paid their full days.\" P&#233;rez was working on nine cases during her final probation period in January 2001, and Hern&#225;ndez testified that \"this work area is simple. It is simple math that one has to do, but you are not simply calculating work days . . . out of nine cases, six cases that weren't worked right ... I mean more than half the work that she did was bad.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hern&#225;ndez testified that the only equipment necessary for attendance work was a calculator; a computer was unnecessary. Hern&#225;ndez also stated that P&#233;rez used a computer to do this work when other employees in the human resources department required use of a computer. Later, Hern&#225;ndez \"approached [P&#233;rez], and [told her] that instructions had been given so that she would leave the desk that had the computer, move to another desk, so that the computer could be used by the human resources analyst.\" According to Hern&#225;ndez, P&#233;rez refused to move.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In her final evaluation of P&#233;rez, covering January 1 to January 15, Hern&#225;ndez found P&#233;rez had not been compliant in three areas: availability to learn, reliability, and cooperation. As to availability to learn, Hern&#225;ndez stated that P&#233;rez \"was given instructions toward her work, toward specific functions . . . and she worked them wrong.\" As to reliability, Hern&#225;ndez testified P&#233;rez \"didn't prove capable of following instructions. Also . . . it is more that . . . she didn't want to do what was said to her. She didn't assume the responsibilities of the position.\" As for cooperation, Hern&#225;ndez recalled specifically P&#233;rez's refusal to allow others to use the computer that she was using.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross-examination, Hern&#225;ndez admitted that during P&#233;rez's final period of probation, she actually supervised P&#233;rez a total of only six to seven days. She conceded that the final evaluation report was supposed to be given, in accord with regulations, ten days before the date of separation. In P&#233;rez's case, the final evaluation was only given on the date of separation, which was January 12. Although in her final evaluation she speculated that P&#233;rez did not want to continue working at the CDA, she acknowledged that four years ago she had considered P&#233;rez a hard worker who would never leave her position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' counsel also questioned Hern&#225;ndez about P&#233;rez's apparent errors. Hern&#225;ndez testified that some of the \"errors\" she testified to on direct examination occurred before she became P&#233;rez's supervisor; that it is improper to evaluate an employee based on things that were done during a period for which the employee had already been evaluated; and that one type of error had nothing to do with P&#233;rez at all. Hern&#225;ndez also stated that all of the attendance and payment records are recalculated at the end of a calendar year or when an employee leaves the agency before the end of the year. Errors made in the initial calculation are usually caught and corrected to avoid improper payment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of this evidence, we must now decide if the district court ruled correctly that there was insufficient evidence of political discrimination for Plaintiffs' case to reach the jury.

Ramos-Alverio,</i> 221 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2000). A plaintiff bringing a political discrimination claim bears the burden of \"producing sufficient direct or circumstantial evidence from which a jury reasonably may infer that [his] constitutionally protected conduct&#8212;in this case, political affiliation . . . was a substantial or motivating factor behind [his] dismissal.\" <i>Acevedo-Diaz v.

Rubianes,</i> 230 F.3d 409, 414 (1st Cir.2000) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted)). The Supreme Court has cautioned that the mere fact that an adverse action was taken after an employee exercises First Amendment rights is not enough by itself to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case. <i>See Board of County Comm'rs v. Umbehr,</i> 518 U.S. 668, 684-85, 116 S.Ct. 2342, 135 L.Ed.2d 843 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To meet this burden, political discrimination plaintiffs often present evidence of verbal or written statements of political or personal animus. <i>See, e.g., Rodr&#237;guez-Mar&#237;n v. Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez,</i> 438 F.3d 72, 76 (1st Cir.2006) (witness testified that a defendant had \"made several comments to her to the effect that he was under political pressure for leaving too many NPP members in cushy positions\"); <i>id.</i> at 78 (witness testified that a defendant insisted that she use phraseology consistent with a particular political party); <i>id.</i> at 81 (witness testified that the defendants \"made statements to her indicating that her demotion was politically motivated\"). Plaintiffs who have lost their jobs also present evidence about the hiring practices of the defendant in the wake of an election generally&#8212;i.e., evidence that the defendants filled all, or most, recently vacated positions with supporters of their political affiliation&#8212;or, more specifically, evidence that the plaintiff's immediate successor had the same affiliation as the defendant. For example, in <i>Acosta-Orozco v. Rodriguez-de-Rivera,</i> 132 F.3d 97 (1st Cir.1997), where \"the plaintiffs were all members of the adverse party . . . their superiors knew this, and . . . their duties were given to active supporters of the party in power,\" we found there was ample evidence for the plaintiffs' case to avoid summary judgment. <i>Id.</i> at 101; <i>see also Rodriguez-Rios v. Cordero,</i> 138 F.3d 22, 24 (\"[O]ther evidence adduced by plaintiff established a prima facie case . . . .

Additionally, even if a plaintiff establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that political affiliation played a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment action, a defendant can raise an affirmative defense specific to this type of case: that is, a defendant can attempt \"to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that [the] plaintiff [ ] would have been dismissed regardless of [his] political affiliation.\" <i>Acevedo-Diaz,</i> 1 F.3d at 66; <i>see also Mt. Healthy,</i> 429 U.S. at 287, 97 S.Ct. 568; <i>Sanchez-Lopez v.

Under Title VII, once the plaintiff establishes a <i>prima facie</i> case, the employer need only submit enough evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact&#8212;i.e., only the burden of production shifts to the employer. However, in a First Amendment political discrimination case, in which the <i>Mt. Healthy</i> scheme is applicable, the burden of persuasion shifts to the defendant, and the plaintiff-employee will prevail unless the fact finder concludes that the defendant has produced enough evidence to establish that the plaintiff's dismissal would have occurred in any event for nondiscriminatory reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Cepero-Rivera v.

Plaintiffs' case</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs presented an unusual case of political discrimination. They did not present any evidence of overt statements of political discrimination. They also did not present evidence that employees of their political affiliation had been replaced predominantly by employees with an opposing political affiliation. Plaintiffs did not even show that their own replacements, if any, had an opposing political affiliation. Instead, after showing that Defendants had opposing political affiliations and had knowledge of their political affiliations, Plaintiffs focused almost exclusively on the suspicious way they were treated by Defendants near the end of their probationary periods, and the allegedly spurious reasons supplied by Defendants for their failure to survive their respective probationary periods. Plaintiffs saw in this evidence a circumstantial case of political discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Defendants' case</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aware of the <i>Mt. Healthy</i> line of cases, Defendants presented a case that also focused on the reasons for Plaintiffs' dismissal. In their view, they were attempting to establish that regardless of any political discrimination, Plaintiffs' dismissals would have occurred anyhow for nondiscriminatory reasons. When they renewed their Rule 50(a) motion, Defendants stated that \"[i]t is defendant's [sic] position that we have presented to the Honorable Court a strong <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense.\" Defendants' counsel continued: \"Defendants produced sufficient facts about plaintiffs [sic] failure to properly perform their duties, and will [sic] have rendered the same evaluations and will [sic] have taken the same termination decision for the reasons that are nondiscriminatory, in other words, <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>V&#225;zquez-Valent&#237;n</i> and the district court's decision</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In concluding that Plaintiffs had not made the requisite showings to get to the jury on their political discrimination claims, the district court relied on our <i>V&#225;zquez-Valent&#237;n</i> decision. In <i>V&#225;zquez-Valent&#237;n,</i> the plaintiff attempted to challenge her demotion in the wake of a change in political administration by relying on some of the typical indicia of political discrimination. <i>See generally</i> 385 F.3d at 23. The defendants in that case \"reassigned several hundred employees, including [the plaintiff].\" <i>Id.</i> at 35. The plaintiff asserted that her reassignment to a lower position was based on improper political discrimination rather than the defendants' claim of a systematic reclassification of existing positions. <i>Id.</i> at 28-29. To demonstrate that the defendants had knowledge of her political affiliation, the plaintiff referred to a single encounter during routine campaign canvassing, and testimony about her prior activities and positions under a previous administration. <i>Id.</i> at 37-38. As to political animus, the plaintiff offered two comments made by the defendants, <i>id.</i> at 36, 38. The plaintiff also presented evidence about her qualifications for the job at issue, and the gradual erosion of her responsibilities when the new administration took charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In concluding that V&#225;zquez-Valent&#237;n presented insufficient evidence to get to the jury on her political discrimination claim, we specified the following deficiencies: (1) she had not presented evidence creating a reasonable inference that the defendants were even aware of her political affiliation when her personnel file was reviewed and she was reassigned to another position; (2) her evidence fell short of proving that she had been treated in a discriminatory manner because of undisputed testimony that she did not meet the statutory procedural requirements for her present position; (3) one of the statements she relied on&#8212;the mayor's comment about \"cleaning house\"&#8212;was not a direct statement about NPP employees; (4) her supervisor's statement of political animus was a stray comment that could not be attributed to the defendant city officials; (5) the actions of her supervisor in failing to provide her with adequate work for five months similarly could not be attributed to the defendants; and (6) importantly, the plaintiff offered no evidence that PDP members were hired to replace the reassigned NPP members. <i>V&#225;zquez-Valent&#237;n,</i> 385 F.3d at 37-40.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Apparently focusing on these deficiencies, the district court saw <i>V&#225;zquez-Valent&#237;n</i> as a baseline for the amount of evidence a political discrimination plaintiff must present in order to reach the jury:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If this case&#8212;if the case of <i>V&#225;zquez-Valent&#237;n</i> did not meet the standard of proof for jury submission . . . then this case, that we are trying now . . . doesn't meet it either. . . . The truth of the matter is that the case of <i>V&#225;zquez</i> . . . contained a lot more evidence of potential discriminatory motives and of a circumstantial nature than the one that we are trying.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's statement is a fair observation as far as it goes. As already noted, there is no evidence in this case of politically discriminatory remarks. There is no evidence of large scale demotions or firings of the members of one political party. But the court's focus on some of the more familiar indicia of political discrimination described in <i>V&#225;zquez-Valent&#237;n</i> may have prevented the district court from recognizing that the evidence of political discrimination presented by Plaintiffs had produced a political discrimination case very different from <i>V&#225;zquez-Valent&#237;n.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. The sufficiency of the evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A plaintiff must typically make four showings to prove a case of political discrimination: (1) the plaintiff and the defendant belong to opposing political affiliations; (2) the defendant has knowledge of the plaintiff's opposing political affiliation; (3) there is a challenged employment action; and (4) \"sufficient evidence, whether direct or circumstantial . . . that political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor . . . that the challenged employment action stemmed from politically based animus.\" <i>Gonz&#225;lez-de-Blasini v. Family Dept.,</i> 377 F.3d 81, 85-86 (1st Cir.2004) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs testified, on direct examination, that they were all affiliated with the NPP. They presented enough circumstantial evidence of Santiago and Hern&#225;ndez's affiliation to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that Defendants were affiliated with the PDP. Plaintiffs proffered testimony that their political affiliations were well-known within the CDA itself, and Hern&#225;ndez, one of the Defendants, asked one of the Plaintiffs to identify her political affiliation. Also, Plaintiffs' evidence portrays a relatively small workplace where everyone knew who everyone else was and political affiliations were common office knowledge. Given this evidence, a reasonable jury could conclude that Defendants knew of Plaintiffs' political affiliations. There is no dispute that Plaintiffs were terminated from their career positions at the end of their probationary periods.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, not surprisingly, this appeal turns on the fourth showing required to prove political discrimination&#8212;that political discrimination was a substantial or motivating factor in the challenged employment action. Before evaluating the evidence on this issue for each Plaintiff, we must make some preliminary points applicable to each Plaintiff's case. We are reviewing a district court's decision to grant judgment as a matter of law. As a result, we must evaluate the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, here Plaintiffs, and we draw all reasonable inferences in their favor. <i>See Figueroa-Torres,</i> 232 F.3d at 273. We \"may not take into account the credibility of witnesses, resolve evidentiary conflicts, nor ponder the weight of the evidence introduced at trial.\" <i>Id.</i> That is the province of the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, in political discrimination cases where the defendants present evidence of the non-discriminatory reasons for the adverse employment decisions at issue, the falsity of those reasons can provide circumstantial evidence that political discrimination was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment decision. This proposition is well-established in Title VII law. In <i>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc.,</i> 530 U.S. 133, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000), the Supreme Court stated that \"[p]roof that the defendant's explanation is unworthy of credence is simply one form of circumstantial evidence that is quite probative of intentional discrimination, and it may be quite persuasive . . . . In appropriate circumstances, the trier of fact can reasonably infer from the falsity of the explanation that the employer is dissembling to cover up a discriminatory purpose.\" <i>Id.</i> at 147, 120 S.Ct. 2097 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted.); <i>see also St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks,</i> 509 U.S. 502, 517, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (\"[P]roving the employer's reason false becomes part of (and often considerably assists) the greater enterprise of proving that the real reason was intentional discrimination\"); <i>McDonough v. City of Quincy,</i> 452 F.3d 8, 17 (1st Cir.2006)(\"Evidence that the defendant's reason was pretext may . . . ground a finding of liability.\"); <i>Fite v. Digital Equipment Corp.,</i> 232 F.3d 3, 7 (1st Cir.2000). The evidentiary significance of a false explanation for an employment decision is based on a general proposition of evidence law. As the Supreme Court explained in <i>Reeves:</i> \"[s]uch an inference [of falsity] is consistent with the <i>general principle of evidence law that the factfinder is entitled to consider a party's dishonesty about a material fact as `affirmative evidence of guilt.'\" Reeves,</i> 530 U.S. at 147, 120 S.Ct. 2097 (emphasis added). This general proposition applies in this case. However, we are not suggesting that a jury's finding that Defendants gave false explanations for their adverse employment decisions would be sufficient alone to establish that political discrimination was a substantial or motivating factor in those employment decisions. We are simply saying that such a finding would be circumstantial evidence of such discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We may also consider the circumstances surrounding the adverse employment decisions affecting the Plaintiffs. Prior to the change in administrations, all three Plaintiffs had uneventful probationary periods with only positive evaluations. Their final evaluations were the only negative marks on their records. These final evaluations were conducted over a brief period of time&#8212;for as little as two weeks (P&#233;rez) to four weeks (Gascot), at a time when Santiago and Hern&#225;ndez faced many other demands for their attention because of the transition in administrations. Although not required to do so, Santiago conceded that he did not take into account Plaintiffs' prior, positive evaluations in reaching his termination decisions. Plaintiffs were never admonished for their alleged performance deficiencies at the time of their occurrences, and they received their negative evaluations on the day of their respective terminations, in contravention of a regulation requiring that the termination and final evaluation \"be given to the employee no less than 10 days before the date of separation.\" Again, we are not suggesting that this evidence alone establishes that political discrimination was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment decision of Defendants. Still, the three employees who described these strikingly similar stories were members of the same political party, now out of power. <i>See, e.g., Rodr&#237;guez-Mar&#237;n v. Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez,</i> 438 F.3d 72, 80 (1st Cir.2006) (\"It is suspicious that both of [the NPP plaintiffs] were demoted without being given any notice or opportunity to defend their promotions, especially since the initial explanation offered for the demotions was simply missing documentation. . . . Further, these missing documents mysteriously reappeared after [the plaintiffs] presented their copies of the missing documents. . . . Even after the missing documents were replaced, [the plaintiffs] were not reinstated; rather, other justifications were given for their demotions.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Importantly, Defendants presented no evidence that they were conducting final evaluations of all probationary employees in the CDA. They presented no evidence that these three employees were the only probationary employees in the department. They presented no evidence that they were engaged in a systematic review of the personnel files of all employees in search of hiring or promotion irregularities. Under the circumstances, a jury could conclude that the common denominator that explains the strikingly similar stories of Plaintiffs was their shared political affiliation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without repeating the summaries of the evidence already presented, we turn now to a closer examination of the evidence presented by each Plaintiff, with a particular focus on the points of conflict in the testimony of the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. P&#233;rez</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In her testimony, P&#233;rez described her job duties and responsibilities, said that she performed them well, and noted that all of her prior evaluations during the probationary period were positive. P&#233;rez used a computer in compiling the wage and vacation information for which she was responsible. She said a computer was \"indispensable . . . to do it efficiently\". Hern&#225;ndez painted a different picture of P&#233;rez's performance, stating that she performed her duties deficiently, committed computational errors, insisted unnecessarily on the use of a computer, and was insubordinate when told to cease using a particular computer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">P&#233;rez challenged Hern&#225;ndez's account in several ways. On cross-examination, Hern&#225;ndez acknowledged that she disregarded a regulation requiring that a probationary employee receive the last evaluation ten days before the date of separation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> P&#233;rez received her last evaluation on the day of her separation. Hern&#225;ndez admitted that by not following the applicable regulation prescribing when evaluations are given to an employee, she increased the number of days she had to conduct P&#233;rez's final evaluation from two days to twelve days. With respect to the computational errors attributed to P&#233;rez, Hern&#225;ndez admitted, on questioning by the district court, that other employees could have been responsible for P&#233;rez's errors. On cross-examination, Hern&#225;ndez also acknowledged that she exaggerated the severity of the consequences of any errors P&#233;rez might have committed in her wage calculations. Finally, Hern&#225;ndez admitted that she included in her final evaluation alleged errors that would have been accounted for in the November 16 to December 31 evaluation, thereby inappropriately considering job performance outside of the final evaluation period. (Additionally, these prior evaluations were positive in spite of those errors.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of these challenges to Hern&#225;ndez's account of P&#233;rez's performance deficiencies, and the responsibility of the jury for assessing the credibility of witnesses, we conclude that a reasonable jury could choose to believe P&#233;rez's account of her performance and reject Hern&#225;ndez's account.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Negr&#243;n</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Much like P&#233;rez, Negr&#243;n testified about her job duties and her satisfactory performance of those duties. Also like P&#233;rez, Negr&#243;n discovered the specific objections to her work at the end of the final day of her probationary period, a violation of the ten-day notice required by the regulation prescribing procedures for probationary periods described above. Negr&#243;n also described a number of specific tasks she was asked to perform for Santiago on his arrival as CDA Administrator. The three tasks at issue were: the installation of a new door lock for Santiago's office; the moving of certain furniture and file cabinets; and the repair of an air conditioning duct in Santiago's office. Because of the content of her final probationary evaluation, Negr&#243;n anticipated Santiago's negative account of her performance of these tasks and provided explanations in her direct testimony for the way she performed them. These explanations for her performance were never given directly to Santiago or anyone else at the agency because she was never given the opportunity to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago testified to a starkly different version of Negr&#243;n's performance of these tasks. On cross-examination, Plaintiffs' counsel challenged the basis for Santiago's objections. As to the moving of the furniture and file cabinets, Negr&#243;n had explained that the furniture and file cabinets were moved as fast as possible, and that the delay was caused by the lack of personnel to move the objects. Santiago conceded that Negr&#243;n had to wait for additional personnel because she could not have moved the objects on her own. As to the installation of the lock on Santiago's office door, Negr&#243;n maintained in her direct testimony that the technician installed the lock improperly despite the specific instructions that she provided. When she was notified of this error, she promptly had the lock reinstalled properly. On cross-examination, Santiago was asked whether Negr&#243;n ordered the technician to install the lock backwards. He admitted, \"I didn't say that she did it.\" Instead, he complained that she should have checked the installation when the work was completed. But he also conceded that installing a lock is \"not that complex\" and that it was not necessary for her to observe the entire installation. As to the repair of the office's air conditioning, Santiago acknowledged that the only reason the air conditioning was not fixed was because he refused to provide the written authorization requested by Negr&#243;n. When Plaintiffs' counsel asked Santiago the reason for his refusal, Santiago said that Negr&#243;n's paperwork was \"redundant\" and it would set a bad precedent. He never said the request was improper or against CDA policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on Negr&#243;n's points of contention with Santiago's account of her job performance, including the violation of the ten day requirement, we conclude that a reasonable jury could choose to believe Negr&#243;n's account of her work and reject Santiago's account as a false explanation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Gascot</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like her fellow Plaintiffs, Gascot described a relatively uneventful probationary period. She detailed her duties as head of the managerial/entrepreneurial school and recounted her satisfactory performance of those duties, as evidenced by her prior positive evaluations. Like Negr&#243;n, based on the contents of her final negative evaluation, Gascot anticipated the objections that Santiago had with the performance of her duties. In his evaluation, Santiago stated as reasons for Gascot's dismissal: \"Improper utilization of funds and resources available in the offering of courses, careless in the effective mantenance of the vehicle in the school.\" Later, in response to an interrogatory requesting all of the reasons for Gascot's dismissal, Santiago mentioned only a single reason: her mismanagement of a CDA vehicle. In his deposition testimony, he elaborated to some degree on his dissatisfaction with Gascot's job performance. He referred to Gascot's mishandling of the CDA vehicle; he said that the school's \"courses were ineffective\"; and he said that Gascot \"did not have an organized working plan for the school.\" On direct examination at trial, Santiago significantly expanded on the deficiencies in Gascot's performance, listing a number of other \"plans\" that Gascot had failed to produce, including a \"capacitation plan,\" a \"study of needs,\" and a \"promotional advertising plan.\" On cross-examination, Santiago admitted that his answer to the interrogatory had not included many of the problems with Gascot's performance that he was now describing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Curiously, when Defendants' counsel cross-examined Gascot, he permitted her to testify that she had prepared a training and service plan for the school and had submitted it as part of transition procedures to Santiago. Moreover, Gascot stated in response to that same cross-examination that Santiago \"had no criteria for rendering\" his negative evaluation because \"[h]e did not meet with me and ask for the plan. He did not ask me for the study or the research of needs. He didn't . . . [say] let's see where are the studies. If he had asked me I would have given them all to him and would have avoided all of this.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross-examination, Santiago admitted to receiving a transition report, introduced into evidence by Plaintiff's counsel, which included a document that Santiago identified as a \"working plan\" for the school, though he claimed to have never seen that working plan before. This exchange suggested that Santiago criticized Gascot for her failure to plan, yet he had received a document from her reflecting such planning. Additionally, Santiago conceded that while he criticized Gascot for not updating the entrepreneurial school's curriculum, that curriculum had remained unchanged at the time of Santiago's departure from the CDA one year later, well after Gascot's departure. Also, he acknowledged that the contents of the transition report he received called into question Santiago's claim that the disrepair of the CDA vehicle was caused by Gascot's neglect because the vehicle was already old when Gascot assumed her responsibilities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of these challenges to Santiago's account of Gascot's performance, we conclude that a reasonable jury could choose to believe Gascot's account of her performance and reject Santiago's account as a false explanation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. Summary</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In essence, Plaintiffs described satisfactory job performances throughout their probationary periods until the new administration arrived with a different political affiliation. Then they received negative evaluations based on a limited period of observation. Those negative evaluations were presented to them on the last day of their probationary periods when they were terminated from their positions, in violation of a regulation requiring that such evaluations be presented to the probationary employees ten days before separation. In their testimony, Defendants explained the deficiencies in the job performance of Plaintiffs justifying these adverse employment decisions. In both their direct testimony, which anticipated some of the explanations by Defendants, and in cross-examination of Defendants, Plaintiffs challenged the authenticity of these accounts. In the presence of this conflicting testimony, a reasonable jury could believe Plaintiffs and disbelieve Defendants. As we have already explained, the fact that a jury could find that Defendants gave false explanations has evidentiary significance. <i>See Reeves,</i> 530 U.S. at 147, 120 S.Ct. 2097 (stating that \"the factfinder is entitled to consider a party's dishonesty about a material fact as `affirmative evidence of guilt'\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, Plaintiffs cannot establish their case of political discrimination solely by persuading a jury that Defendants' explanations were false. Plaintiffs have the burden of establishing specifically that political discrimination was a substantial or motivating factor for the adverse employment action. <i>See Acevedo-Diaz,</i> 1 F.3d at 66. On this issue, there was other relevant evidence that a jury could consider to supplement a jury finding of false explanations for the adverse employment decisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These three dismissals all happened within one month of a change in political administrations. The temporal proximity between a change in political administrations and an adverse employment action is relevant to the issue of whether political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment decision. <i>See Acevedo-Diaz,</i> 1 F.3d at 69 (\"<i>Mere</i> temporal proximity between a change of administration and a public employee's dismissal is insufficient to establish discriminatory animus\" (emphasis added).). Moreover, a jury could conclude that it was more than coincidence that the three probationary employees who lost their jobs were members of the same political party now out of power. For unexplained reasons, these three employees became the focus of hurried evaluations that, in some important respects, did not conform to the regulations for such evaluations of probationary employees. These hurried evaluations gave the appearance of a coordinated effort to rid the agency of three employees who shared a different political affiliation than the party now in power.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, a reasonable fact finder could conclude that Plaintiffs have established that political discrimination was a substantial or motivating factor in the loss of their jobs. Therefore, it was an error of law for the court to grant Defendants' second Rule 50(a) motion and keep from the jury P&#233;rez's claim against Hern&#225;ndez, and the claims of Negr&#243;n and Gascot against Santiago.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, we <i>affirm</i> the district court's dismissal of P&#233;rez's claim against Santiago. We <i>vacate</i> its dismissal of P&#233;rez's claim against Hern&#225;ndez, and the claims of Negr&#243;n and Gascot against Santiago. Each party is to bear its own costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> <i>See V&#225;zquez-Valent&#237;n v.

The defendants asserted that the plaintiff had presented insufficient evidence of political discrimination to permit the case to go to the jury. We agreed. <i>See generally</i> 385 F.3d at 23. However, in order to conduct that evaluation of the defendants' motion, we excused the defendants' failure to preserve that ground pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(b), which requires renewal of a Rule 50(a) motion after the jury has returned a verdict.

The jury trial began on September 20, 2004. At the close of Plaintiffs' case on September 21, 2004, Defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law under Fed. R.Civ.P. 50(a), asserting that Plaintiffs had not presented sufficient evidence to reach the jury on their case of political discrimination.

Ruling from the bench that same day, the district court granted Defendants' motion. In presenting their renewed Rule 50(a) motion, Defendants relied heavily on our decision in <i>V&#225;zquez-Valent&#237;n,</i> which was published during the trial. It is also apparent from the record that the district court reviewed <i>V&#225;zquez-Valent&#237;n</i> during the noon break between the morning session of the trial&#8212;when Defendants made their second Rule 50(a) motion&#8212;and the afternoon session when the district court ruled on the motion. The district court explained its reading of the import of <i>V&#225;zquez-Valent&#237;n</i> in these terms:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If this case&#8212;if the case of <i>V&#225;zquez-Valentin</i> did not meet the standard of proof for jury submission as to the fact of whether political discrimination was a substantial or motivating factor in the challenged employment action, then this case, that we are trying now, the one that is before us, doesn't meet it, either.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The truth of the matter is that the case of <i>V&#225;zquez</i> . . . contained a lot more evidence of potential discriminatory motives and of a circumstantial nature than the one that we are trying.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So under those circumstances, it seems to me that I don't see how I can let this case go to the jury.... I recognize, and I know, on the basis of my experience, that when these things happen in the context of positions like this, usually you have to look carefully, because there is always the good possibility that improper political motives were behind the personnel action. But it is not what I think; it is what the evidence sustains.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And obviously, the problem that I have here is that there is no evidence other than a scintilla of evidence to let this case go to a jury, and this case [<i>V&#225;zquez-Valent&#237;n</i>] is extremely clear as to what is required. And the case before me doesn't satisfy the standard. ....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So on the basis of that, I have no other alternative but to disregard my own feelings as to what the case is and enter a judgment under Rule 50, dismissing it on the basis of insufficiency of evidence on the issue of political discrimination under this case of <i>V&#225;zquez v. Santiago</i> [sic]. No other alternative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs read this ruling as reflecting the district court's focus on the evidence in their case only and a disregard of the evidence presented by Defendants. If, in fact, the district court examined only the evidence presented in Plaintiffs' case when granting Defendants' renewed Rule 50(a) motion, this would be an error of law. <i>See</i> 9A Wright &amp; Miller, <i>Federal Practice</i> <i>and Procedure, Civil 2d</i> &#167; 2534 (2d ed. 1994) (\"A renewed [Rule 50(a)(1)] motion will be judged in the light of the case as it stands at that time.\"); <i>Potti v.

For example, in an exchange with defense counsel concerning the renewed Rule 50(a) motion, the district court insisted \"[r]emember, I wanted the [sic] hear the evidence as a whole.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, we need not decide which characterization of the district court's ruling is accurate. Even if the district court had unambiguously focused only on Plaintiffs' evidence&#8212;and hence had committed an error of law by disregarding Defendants' evidence when ruling on the renewed Rule 50(a) motion&#8212;we could not rule in Plaintiffs' favor if, in fact, the totality of the evidence did not permit their case to go to the jury. We engage in <i>de novo</i> review of the district court's decision granting judgment as a matter of law. <i>See Webber v. Int'l Paper Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201753\"><a href=\"/opinion/201753/webber-v-international-paper/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></a></span>, 233 (1st Cir.2005). We can affirm on any basis available in the record because \"[w]e are not wedded to the lower court's rationale, but, rather, may affirm its order on any independent ground made manifest by the record.\" <i>InterGen N.V. v.

Therefore, the dispositive question on appeal is whether, in light of the totality of the evidence, the district court correctly ruled that there was insufficient evidence of political discrimination to permit the Plaintiffs' case to go to the jury. To pursue this inquiry, and to provide an adequate basis for explaining our decision, we must first set forth in some detail the evidence adduced at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 7, 2000, general elections were held in Puerto Rico. The Popular Democratic Party's (\"PDP\") candidate for governor won that election, leading to a change of administration from the incumbent New Progressive Party (\"NPP\") to the PDP. Defendant Santiago was appointed Administrator of the CDA on or about January 7, 2001. As such, he was in charge of all of the CDA's operations. At the time of the change in regime, Defendant Hern&#225;ndez served as a Human Resources Officer and Officer of Labor Relations, meaning that she carried out hiring and termination decisions and managed payroll, with Santiago's approval. Plaintiff P&#233;rez worked in the human resources department of the CDA, where she maintained attendance and payroll records. Plaintiff Negr&#243;n served as the director of the general services division. She was responsible for supervising the maintenance of the CDA's physical plant and equipment, obtaining supplies, and providing support for the vehicles and equipment of her division. Plaintiff Gascot was director of the CDA's management and entrepreneurial school. Her duties included managing the school's equipment and physical resources, budgeting, and planning the school's curriculum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Within three to four weeks after the change of administration in early January 2001, all of the Plaintiffs had lost their jobs at the CDA. Plaintiffs' case consisted almost entirely of descriptions of what happened to them in those three to four weeks, and the circumstances of their terminations from the CDA. Defendants' case consisted entirely of explanations of why they were justified in terminating Plaintiffs. Although the trial lasted six days, and included other witnesses,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> we summarize only the testimony of the three Plaintiffs and the two remaining Defendants. For the testimony of each of the Plaintiffs&#8212;P&#233;rez, Negr&#243;n, and Gascot&#8212;we divide the summary of their testimony into three sections: (1) before the change of administration; (2) after the change of administration; and (3) political affiliation testimony. Then we summarize the testimony of Defendants&#8212;Santiago and Hern&#225;ndez&#8212;with Santiago's testimony related as it pertains to each of the three Plaintiffs; and Hern&#225;ndez's related only as it pertains to Plaintiff P&#233;rez. As noted earlier, the First Amendment claims of each of the three Plaintiffs against Santiago survived Defendants' first Rule 50(a) motion. But only P&#233;rez's claim against Hern&#225;ndez survived that same motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Plaintiffs</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1.

Employment history before Santiago's arrival</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">P&#233;rez obtained a bachelor's degree in economics and a master's degree in business administration, specializing in human resources. She worked in government for about nine years before leaving to raise her children. At the time she left, she served as an economist at the Statistics Bureau in the Department of Labor. After her children matured, she decided to return to work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">She returned to work first in the private sector at a temporary employment services company, Top Notch. Top Notch told her to apply for a vacant secretarial position in the CDA administrator's office, which she obtained. While working in the administrator's office, P&#233;rez applied for and obtained a career position in the CDA's human resources office.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">P&#233;rez stated that her first task in her position in the human resources department was to update the time cards of all CDA employees, which had fallen behind since her predecessor's departure in December 1999. She was \"supposed to check the time cards, the weekly time cards, that all the employees had to punch and check to see if they had worked every day, if they had not worked every day. See if they had taken leave . . . . In other words, I was supposed to record their attendance on a weekly basis.\" P&#233;rez testified that she performed this work, at least initially, on an adding machine, which her predecessor had done, despite her knowledge of computer programs and usage. Subsequently, she began to use a computer to do her work. She stated that the attendance records were current up to December 2000 at the time of her termination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a probationary employee, P&#233;rez was subject to periodic evaluations of her performance during the probationary period, which spanned from July 15, 2000 to January 15, 2001. She was evaluated three times prior to Santiago's appointment as head of the CDA for the following time periods: (1) July 15, 2000 to September 15, 2000; September 18, 2000 to November 15, 2000; and (3) November 16, 2000 to December 31, 2000. These prior evaluations, all of which were positive, were signed by Margarita Martinez, who was the director of the human resources department for this period (and replaced by Jim&#233;nez when the administration changed). However, P&#233;rez understood that Hern&#225;ndez, not Martinez, was her immediate supervisor, although P&#233;rez was never officially told this.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b.

She was evaluated by Hern&#225;ndez, her superior in the human resources office. However, P&#233;rez also stated that, during those fifteen days, she and Hern&#225;ndez were actually in the office at the same time for only six and a half days because of weekends and holidays. On this final written evaluation, Hern&#225;ndez had written that P&#233;rez was not receptive to instructions, unreliable, and \"rarely willing to collaborate.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No one reviewed P&#233;rez's final evaluation with her. Also, P&#233;rez never received any verbal admonishment or reprimand for the various mistakes reported on the final evaluation. The written evaluation was handed to her on her final day at the CDA, which was January 12, 2001.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross-examination, defense counsel questioned P&#233;rez's testimony that she had never been verbally reprimanded for errors she committed in her work. Defense counsel also asked about the details of those instances of error. P&#233;rez claimed that she had no recollection of having committed any errors. Defense counsel also questioned P&#233;rez regarding the necessity of using a computer to complete the tasks assigned to her. P&#233;rez contended that a computer was necessary to perform her tasks \"efficiently\".</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. Political affiliations</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">P&#233;rez testified that she was affiliated with the NPP and had been since she was a teenager. During election years, she had attended party meetings. Although P&#233;rez testified that she knew Hern&#225;ndez's political affiliation, she never explicitly identified that affiliation for the court. As to Santiago, P&#233;rez knew that he was the new appointee for Administrator of the CDA for the incoming PDP administration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regarding Defendants' knowledge of her political affiliation, P&#233;rez stated that her affiliation with the NPP was widely known at the CDA. Politics was openly discussed at the office, particularly during the 2000 election year, and she was \"very open about [her] affiliation .... When [she] obtained the position in the human resources office [she] spoke with [her] fellow co-workers there about [her] political affiliation.\" Just before the 2000 elections, she stated that she had left to attend an NPP meeting during her lunch hour and all of her co-workers saw her leave. While P&#233;rez never directly discussed politics with Hern&#225;ndez, she believed that Hern&#225;ndez knew her political affiliation because there were only six people in her office at the CDA. In her prior position in the CDA administrator's office, all of the employees were affiliated with the NPP, and she \"didn't hide [her affiliation] because [she] didn't have reason to.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Maribel Negr&#243;n-Almeda</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. Employment history before Santiago's arrival</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Negr&#243;n had a bachelor's degree in business administration. After obtaining her degree she began work in the private sector, where she worked until she married and left the workforce for a time. After that break, she began working at the CDA shortly before the change in administration. Her position, a career position, had a six-month probationary period from August 1, 2000 to January 31, 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Negr&#243;n testified that she was evaluated three times prior to Santiago's arrival at the CDA for the following time periods: (1) August 1, 2000 to September 30, 2000; (2) October 1, 2000 to November 30, 2000; and (3) December 1, 2000 to December 31, 2000. Juan Matos Gonzalez, Negr&#243;n's supervisor and the auxiliary superintendent of the CDA prior to the change in administration, performed these evaluations, all of which were positive. Gonzalez occupied a trust position and tendered his resignation effective December 31, 2000. To Negr&#243;n's knowledge, no one was appointed to replace him following Santiago's arrival.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b.

One incident involved changing the locks on the door of Santiago's office. According to Negr&#243;n, Santiago's secretary instructed her to have the lock installed a certain way, and Negr&#243;n contacted the appropriate company and conveyed these instructions. However, the technician installed the lock incorrectly. \"The following day [Negr&#243;n] was told there was a problem. [She] once more called the company. The company came back and they once more reinstalled the lock.\" The only verbal admonishment Negr&#243;n acknowledged \"had to do with [this incident]. That was the wrong way. So we proceeded to change it.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another incident involved the placement of some file cabinets and other furniture, including a counter/desk. Negr&#243;n testified that once she received the requests from Santiago, she attempted to contact the two employees who performed these duties; however, the position for one of those employees was vacant, and the other employee was \"quite old[,] and those file cabinets weighed approximately 100 pounds.\" She informed Santiago of the problem, but told him that she would ask two other employees to do the moving. Because these two employees were not specifically tasked with this type of work, they had to coordinate schedules to find a time that would work, which caused a delay in the moving of the cabinets. To Negr&#243;n's recollection, Santiago was pleased with the work that was done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Negr&#243;n also recalled Santiago asking her \"to have an air conditioner duct moved which was in his office.\" She \"coordinated with the company that had the air conditioning contract . . . [and] received the estimate for the work.\" However, that work was never carried out while Negr&#243;n was at the CDA \"because [Santiago] never signed the authorization for [her].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On her final evaluation, for the period from January 9, 2001 to January 31, 2001, Santiago gave her failing marks. In the written evaluation Negr&#243;n received, Santiago stated that Negr&#243;n had ignored his instructions and performed tasks carelessly and negligently. The evaluation contained similar comments about her cooperativeness. Negr&#243;n stated that Santiago never discussed his negative evaluation with her. Negr&#243;n testified that Santiago gave the evaluation to her at the end of the work day on January 31, 2001, her final day at the CDA, and informed her that she did not pass her probationary period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross-examination, defense counsel questioned Negr&#243;n's account of her performance of the tasks requested by Santiago. Specifically, he asked her: whether the furniture and file cabinets were moved on the same day that she was told to have them moved; for more details as to why the air conditioner was never installed; and whether the lock had been installed improperly because she conveyed inaccurate instructions to the technician. Negr&#243;n responded that: any delay in moving furniture and file cabinets was caused by unavoidable logistical issues, and the objects were moved as fast as possible; the air conditioner was not installed because Santiago never gave proper written authorization; and the improper installation was the result of an error by the technician (rather than an error in her instructions) that was corrected as soon as was possible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. Political affiliations</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Negr&#243;n testified that she had been affiliated with the NPP since \"[she] was very young.\" This affiliation was formalized in June 2000 when she went to an NPP office and filled out paperwork to that effect. Negr&#243;n stated that she knew the political affiliation of Santiago: \"[D]uring the few times that I was able to talk to him he would stress that he enjoyed the full trust of the governor and he would always say that he enjoyed a position of trust because he had the governor's trust, so I understood that he had&#8212;he was affiliated to that party [PDP].\" In particular, Negr&#243;n recalled Santiago raising this issue of political affiliation when he asked her to change the car that had been assigned to him at the CDA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for Defendants' knowledge of her political affiliation, Negr&#243;n believed that her affiliation was known at the CDA because \"the elections were already approaching by that time.... [I]n my area people would talk. . . . We would talk about who would win and who would lose . . . . We would talk and you would talk about who you felt was going to win and everybody just knew your party.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Aracelis Gascot-Cuadrado</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. Employment history before Santiago's arrival</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gascot had a bachelor's degree in business administration, with a focus on secondary education, and a master's degree in administration and supervision of schools. She worked as a teacher in a number of high schools, and then later in a superintendent's office until 1993 when she began working in the CDA as the entrepreneurial director, which at that time was categorized as an \"Assistant II\" position. She worked in this position for seven years. In the spring of 2000, Gascot became aware of a posting, dated April 14, 2000, for the position of director of the CDA's management and entrepreneurial school, a career position. She applied for and obtained this position, which had an \"eight-month probation period [and] I was to have evaluations every two months ... the first evaluation undertaken from June the 1st to July the 31st. The first of the first two months of work.\" The probation period would end on January 31, 2001. Gascot's duties included managing the school's equipment and physical resources, budgeting, and planning the school's curriculum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Within that eight-month period, Gascot was evaluated for the following time periods: (1) June 1, 2000 to July 31, 2000; (2) August 1, 2000 to September 30, 2000; (3) October 1, 2000 to November 30, 2000; and (4) December 1, 2000 to December 31, 2000. These evaluations were performed by Gonzalez. Gascot received all positive evaluations. After Gonzalez's departure following the change in administration, Gascot was not informed of anyone taking Gonzalez's position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. Employment history following Santiago's arrival and alleged employment deficiencies</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aside from a general, agency-wide meeting where he was introduced to the CDA as the newly-appointed administrator on January 9, Gascot recalled only \"one occasion in which [she] met personally with Santiago,\" which occurred on January 14 or 15. On that occasion she went to his office: \"[a] group of employees was dismissed [from their jobs] and he asked me to explain to him regarding an aid program for them. I explained to him what the program was about, and what was normally done.\" Gascot stated that Santiago never discussed the nature of her work at the CDA and never conducted any evaluation of the program she directed. Gascot testified that \"during the transitionary period a report was made for the work performed at the school and it stated the amount of participants which had increased and the working plan.\" While it is unclear from the record whether Gascot prepared this report herself, Gascot stated that Santiago never requested from her either statistics about the school or that working plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On her final evaluation, for the period from January 1 to January 31, Gascot noted that as to her planning, organization, and performance, Santiago had written the same thing: \"improper utilization of funds and resources available in the offering of courses, careless in the effective maintenance of the vehicle assigned to the school.\" Gascot testified that this \"evaluation was not discussed with me at any time\" and \"was given to me on January 31, 2001. That was the date that ended my probation period.\" On January 31, Gascot was told not to leave work that day without going to the administrator's office. She went to the administrator's office at 5:10 pm, where she was handed a letter that read, in part: \"[i]n view of the above, effective today, January 31, 2001, you are being separated from the position you have been occupying at the agency. If you are not in agreement with this decision you are entitled to discuss it within the next ten days with the personnel administration.\" Gascot stated that \"[w]hen the document was given to me and I was about to talk ... [Defendant] Ms. Vilma Gim&#233;nez [sic] tells me that that [sic] is not the forum for me to talk.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Gascot, it was only later, through Santiago's deposition, that she learned why Santiago had given her such a negative final evaluation. Gascot recalled that Santiago had \"said that [she] had been assigned a mobile unit [truck] ... [which] was deteriorated and [she] had used it wrongly and it was not well used and there were badly used funds.\" To Gascot's knowledge, the vehicle was purchased by a prior administrator in 1995 or 1996 for the CDA. It was her understanding that \"[a]ll agency vehicles are under the General Services Administration. They are the ones who provide maintenance of the vehicles.\" Gascot claimed that she never used the vehicle during her time as director of the managerial school. Gascot also learned through Santiago's deposition that rumors came to him from other business centers and business people that the courses were \"inefficient\" and \"nonoperative,\" but he could not recall the names of anyone from whom he heard these rumors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross-examination, Gascot again testified that she believed that the agency vehicle for which Santiago held her responsible was, in fact, \"the responsibility of the general services department,\" which, as of August 2000, was run by Negr&#243;n.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. Political affiliations</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gascot stated that she was affiliated with the NPP, and had been since she first voted forty (40) years ago. She participated in ladies' groups, political reelection groups, and professional agencies. She also belonged to an NPP group comprised of CDA employees that met outside of working hours. During the 2000 election, Gascot participated in municipal campaigns, and served as an election functionary, checking voter lists. Gascot testified that she knew the political affiliations of both Hern&#225;ndez and Santiago&#8212;they were both members of the PDP. As to Hern&#225;ndez, Gascot stated that Hern&#225;ndez \"had been working [at the CDA] for many years. She has held high posts within her town. She's also worked within her political party and it is known throughout all the [CDA] employees that she belongs to the Popular Democratic Party.\" As to Santiago, Gascot testified that \"when he came to the [CDA] he came from COFEC [Corporation for the Economic Development of the Capital City].... It was a department within the municipality of San Juan created when Sila Maria Calderon [the new PDP governor] was there.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gascot testified that her affiliation was known at the CDA because she first arrived at the CDA as a special aide under an NPP administration, a trust position. Gascot recalled specifically that Hern&#225;ndez had direct knowledge of her affiliation. Gascot recalled an incident when she first started working as the director of the managerial school. Hern&#225;ndez, who Gascot identified as the \"institutional brain\" of the CDA, asked her to identify her political affiliation. By \"institutional brain,\" Gascot understood Hern&#225;ndez to be an individual who \"dedicate[s] themselves to identify[ing] the [political affiliation of the] people when they come in.\" Hern&#225;ndez was \"the person who knows everybody in there.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.

Carlos Gabriel Santiago</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before being appointed as head of the CDA, Santiago was appointed the executive president of COFEC, \"a corporation of economic development for the capital city [of Puerto Rico]. It is a development company which gives loans to small businesses in San Juan and also other municipalities in the island.\" He was appointed by COFEC's board of twelve directors. He became administrator of the CDA on January 7, 2001, and he \"stopped being the director in January 2002.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. P&#233;rez</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Santiago acknowledged that Hern&#225;ndez made the final decision on P&#233;rez's retention of her position following her probationary period, he stated that Hern&#225;ndez had consulted with him. Hern&#225;ndez told him that she \"wasn't satisfied with the inefficient way that P&#233;rez was performing the task of her job, and [Hern&#225;ndez] understood that [P&#233;rez] wasn't going to fulfill the expectations of the position.\" Santiago ultimately endorsed Hern&#225;ndez's dismissal of P&#233;rez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross-examination by Plaintiff's counsel, Santiago conceded that prior to P&#233;rez's termination, Santiago did not speak to her to discuss his intentions to terminate her. He admitted that he did not remember if Hern&#225;ndez had told him about P&#233;rez's educational qualifications or the fact that P&#233;rez's position had been vacant for six months prior to her filling that position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. Negr&#243;n</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago stated that he got to know Negr&#243;n and that \"her performance was low, very low ... more than poor. It was just bad.\" He testified that he gave her instructions to move furniture and file cabinets, change locks, and repair air conditioners. As to the moving of furniture and file cabinets, he stated that he gave Negr&#243;n the instruction personally, but she did not comply. Moreover, Santiago stated that Negr&#243;n misplaced the file cabinets \"because it was more than an issue of instructions or permission. It was more of [Negr&#243;n] started establishing territory in the agency.... So it was more of hostility to me.\" He stated that the file cabinets were misplaced and Negr&#243;n's reaction was simply \"[t]hat there was no space anywhere else except in my office.\" On another occasion involving the moving of files, according to Santiago, it \"took a few days, three or four days, because the argument was the same: There was no space, so those had to remain there.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the counter/desk, Santiago stated that Negr&#243;n \"counterordered\" the moving of the counter from a location preferred by Santiago. He felt \"concerned and even pressured psychologically because the situation was more than just me saying things one way and things happening another. And it was more of a controversy.\" As to the air conditioning duct, Santiago confirmed that the air conditioning in his office was never repaired. He also confirmed that the reason \"was that the order had to be in writing.\" However, Santiago testified that he thought this was unreasonable. \"[Negr&#243;n] insisted that every task that she was ordered to do, even if it was the simplest of tasks, had to be in writing ... it wasn't enough that it had to be [in] a memorandum for [Negr&#243;n], but it also had to be&#8212;the requisition had to be signed .... the process was done twice for whatever was needed.\" According to him, he asked Negr&#243;n three times to fix the air conditioning duct, and it was never done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the installation of a new lock on his office door, Santiago recalled that he was in his office when it was installed. After the installation, when he went to leave, \"the lock [was] installed inside out, meaning that the lock that has the key is on the inside, and on the outside is the part where you can do it manually.... And so I am locked in my office. I am trapped.\" His specific complaint was that Negr&#243;n did not remain to supervise the installation of the lock. In his opinion, with the lock incident as an exemplar, \"it was impossible to articulate a particular operational plan with [Negr&#243;n] because, if things this simple could not be solved and saying that this was simply a mistake ... it was something that would concern any supervisor .... it even got to the point in my mind that I concluded that, if ever there was a person that was not going to cooperate . . . it was [Negr&#243;n].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On his final evaluation of Negr&#243;n, regarding the \"performance\" factor, Santiago stated that Negr&#243;n \"did not meet the goals and objectives, be them small as they could be, and also the effective solutions of unforeseen situations like the one regarding the lock.... It shouldn't be the duty of a director to constantly be in controversy with the head of an agency. It [was her duty] to keep in operational conditions the physical facilities of the agency, which [Negr&#243;n] did not perform, did not do.\" As to the \"cooperation\" factor, \"[Negr&#243;n] didn't have the appropriate attitude. It was more of a serious problem in terms of personality in terms of trying to be in controversy all the time. And also to collaborate ... that never happened.... And to obtain the maximum effort from the personnel. [Negr&#243;n] never complied with this. On the contrary, she prevented things from happening.\" According to Santiago, the period from January 9 to January 31 was \"more than enough\" time to observe Negr&#243;n's performance. He treated this stretch of time as 20 days.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross-examination, Santiago revised this number of days for observing Negr&#243;n to 16. He also admitted that his office was isolated from Negr&#243;n's (a floor away) such that he only observed her when the two had direct interaction. Santiago conceded that one of the pieces of furniture that he requested be moved, a counter, was something that Negr&#243;n could not move on her own. As to the lock, Plaintiffs' counsel asked, among other things, why Santiago did not prevent the incorrect installation of the lock since he was in his office when it was installed. Santiago stated that he was occupied with work and that the door was actually some distance from his desk. As to the air conditioning problem, Plaintiffs' counsel asked Santiago whether it was in fact reasonable policy for Negr&#243;n to have written authorization for work done in order to keep a record for accounting purposes, and because checks were issued by a separate department of the CDA. Santiago replied that Negr&#243;n's paperwork \"was additional,\" meaning redundant. Plaintiffs' counsel also questioned Santiago as to the difficulty of completing Negr&#243;n's paperwork (essentially, writing \"Approved\"). Santiago responded that it would set a problematic precedent, requiring signatures for everything.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Gascot</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago stated that he had an opportunity to evaluate Gascot's performance, which he described as \"`poor,' that it did not meet the standard.\" He claimed that as far as planning, coordinating, and directing the entrepreneurial school, Gascot \"peformed duties that were more of a routine, more of a day-to-day operational basis and instead of planning and coordinating and looking to the future, that effort did not exist.\" As to the agency vehicle in dispute, Santiago stated that Gascot \"and I had had our differences in how to use the mobile truck to the entrepreneurial school, the fact that it had been abandoned in the parking lot of the agency to be deteriorated.\" He testified that the vehicle was assigned to the entrepreneurial school; the funds for it came from the entrepreneurial school; and the side of the vehicle said \"Commercial Development, Entrepreneurial School.\" Santiago identified documents confirming the disrepair of the vehicle, dated December 28, 2000 and January 11, 2001. Additionally, auditors from the controller's office requested documents and information from Negr&#243;n regarding the purchase, maintenance, and future use of the agency vehicle in question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago stated that he believed that no one in the CDA wanted to be responsible for the vehicle&#8212;\"[t]he entrepreneurial school said it was from general services, and general services said it belonged to the entrepreneurial school.\" In summary, Santiago expected Gascot \"[t]o assume responsibility, to assume responsibility for things that are under her direct supervision ... [b]ut that didn't even happen.\" Santiago also claimed that he \"never saw [an] annual plan [for training services] from\" Gascot. He continued \"I honestly think that ... Gascot didn't have the capacity to prepare such a plan.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago also testified that Gascot failed to develop or propose a number of plans: a \"capacitation plan\" for communication between the central school in San Juan and centers throughout the island; \"a study of needs ... to develop a study determining the needs for training which is offered to businessmen\"; a \"promotion advertising plan\" for \"what was going to be published in the advertisements.\" Additionally, he criticized Gascot for allowing \"the course of offering of the entrepreneurial school [to] become obsolete or inefficient in terms to what the businessmen wanted.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago claimed that he spoke to Gascot about all of these failures, but she gave her \"usual response, that she didn't give me a clue&#8212;or she didn't give me any way that I could believe that she was going to be in charge of that, that she would take care of it.\" He conceded that \"[c]ertainly there were other issues\" on his mind during the transition period, but that he devoted \"from five to 10 hours\" to the entrepreneurial school and Gascot. He stated that he \"saw the [prior] evaluations in the file, but those evaluations were not in agreement with what [he] saw ... of Gascot's work performance.\" He performed the final evaluation of Gascot with the help of Hern&#225;ndez and Jim&#233;nez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross-examination, Santiago admitted that his office was a number of floors away from that of Gascot, and he only observed her when the two had direct interaction. He also identified a transition report that was given to him on his arrival at the CDA, which stated that the agency vehicle for which Gascot was responsible was purchased from \"General Services by Commercial Development Services\" and that the vehicle was already eight years old when it was purchased, meaning it was twelve years old when Santiago first saw it. Santiago also conceded that evaluations of an employee's probationary period should only take into account actions performed during that period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' counsel also questioned Santiago about an apparent inconsistency between his testimony on direct examination and his response to an interrogatory prior to trial. The interrogatory had asked for any and all reasons for dismissing Gascot; Santiago listed and explained only the vehicle incident. He did not mention any inability to engage in planning. Santiago also stated that, even though he was an accountant, he did not check the agency's property ledger to determine, ultimately, who was responsible for the vehicle, but that he \"must have sent somebody to check it.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under further questioning from Plaintiffs' counsel, Santiago identified a 2000/2001 work plan for the entrepreneurial school, but stated that he had never seen the document. He also conceded that when he left the CDA a year after becoming its administrator, the courses being offered by the entrepreneurial school had not changed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Susana Hern&#225;ndez Colon</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hern&#225;ndez's testimony focused only on P&#233;rez.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> On direct examination, Hern&#225;ndez testified to a number of instances where P&#233;rez \"worked [] attendance sheets without being duly authorized by the immediate supervisor ... meaning that the agency would pay employees that had not been working.\" However, on questioning by the district court as to whether \"somebody else could have been at fault,\" Hern&#225;ndez conceded that it was possible \"that more than one person may have been involved in this negligence.\" Hern&#225;ndez also recounted incidents where she directly asked P&#233;rez to review the vacation (\"leave\") records of certain employees, including some outgoing ones. According to Hern&#225;ndez, P&#233;rez committed errors on these types of records as well, the consequence being that \"we would have paid the employee less days when the employee would have had a right to be paid their full days.\" P&#233;rez was working on nine cases during her final probation period in January 2001, and Hern&#225;ndez testified that \"this work area is simple. It is simple math that one has to do, but you are not simply calculating work days . . . out of nine cases, six cases that weren't worked right ... I mean more than half the work that she did was bad.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hern&#225;ndez testified that the only equipment necessary for attendance work was a calculator; a computer was unnecessary. Hern&#225;ndez also stated that P&#233;rez used a computer to do this work when other employees in the human resources department required use of a computer. Later, Hern&#225;ndez \"approached [P&#233;rez], and [told her] that instructions had been given so that she would leave the desk that had the computer, move to another desk, so that the computer could be used by the human resources analyst.\" According to Hern&#225;ndez, P&#233;rez refused to move.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In her final evaluation of P&#233;rez, covering January 1 to January 15, Hern&#225;ndez found P&#233;rez had not been compliant in three areas: availability to learn, reliability, and cooperation. As to availability to learn, Hern&#225;ndez stated that P&#233;rez \"was given instructions toward her work, toward specific functions . . . and she worked them wrong.\" As to reliability, Hern&#225;ndez testified P&#233;rez \"didn't prove capable of following instructions. Also . . . it is more that . . . she didn't want to do what was said to her. She didn't assume the responsibilities of the position.\" As for cooperation, Hern&#225;ndez recalled specifically P&#233;rez's refusal to allow others to use the computer that she was using.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross-examination, Hern&#225;ndez admitted that during P&#233;rez's final period of probation, she actually supervised P&#233;rez a total of only six to seven days. She conceded that the final evaluation report was supposed to be given, in accord with regulations, ten days before the date of separation. In P&#233;rez's case, the final evaluation was only given on the date of separation, which was January 12. Although in her final evaluation she speculated that P&#233;rez did not want to continue working at the CDA, she acknowledged that four years ago she had considered P&#233;rez a hard worker who would never leave her position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' counsel also questioned Hern&#225;ndez about P&#233;rez's apparent errors. Hern&#225;ndez testified that some of the \"errors\" she testified to on direct examination occurred before she became P&#233;rez's supervisor; that it is improper to evaluate an employee based on things that were done during a period for which the employee had already been evaluated; and that one type of error had nothing to do with P&#233;rez at all. Hern&#225;ndez also stated that all of the attendance and payment records are recalculated at the end of a calendar year or when an employee leaves the agency before the end of the year. Errors made in the initial calculation are usually caught and corrected to avoid improper payment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of this evidence, we must now decide if the district court ruled correctly that there was insufficient evidence of political discrimination for Plaintiffs' case to reach the jury. In conducting this review, we keep in mind that Rule 50(a) motions:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">will be granted only in those instances where, after having examined the evidence as well as all permissible inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to non-movant, the court finds that a reasonable jury could not render a verdict to the party's favor. In carrying out this analysis the court may not take into account the credibility of witnesses, resolve evidentiary conflicts, nor ponder the weight of the evidence introduced at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Figueroa-Torres v.

Plaintiffs' case</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs presented an unusual case of political discrimination. They did not present any evidence of overt statements of political discrimination. They also did not present evidence that employees of their political affiliation had been replaced predominantly by employees with an opposing political affiliation. Plaintiffs did not even show that their own replacements, if any, had an opposing political affiliation. Instead, after showing that Defendants had opposing political affiliations and had knowledge of their political affiliations, Plaintiffs focused almost exclusively on the suspicious way they were treated by Defendants near the end of their probationary periods, and the allegedly spurious reasons supplied by Defendants for their failure to survive their respective probationary periods. Plaintiffs saw in this evidence a circumstantial case of political discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Defendants' case</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aware of the <i>Mt. Healthy</i> line of cases, Defendants presented a case that also focused on the reasons for Plaintiffs' dismissal. In their view, they were attempting to establish that regardless of any political discrimination, Plaintiffs' dismissals would have occurred anyhow for nondiscriminatory reasons. When they renewed their Rule 50(a) motion, Defendants stated that \"[i]t is defendant's [sic] position that we have presented to the Honorable Court a strong <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense.\" Defendants' counsel continued: \"Defendants produced sufficient facts about plaintiffs [sic] failure to properly perform their duties, and will [sic] have rendered the same evaluations and will [sic] have taken the same termination decision for the reasons that are nondiscriminatory, in other words, <i>Mt.

In <i>V&#225;zquez-Valent&#237;n,</i> the plaintiff attempted to challenge her demotion in the wake of a change in political administration by relying on some of the typical indicia of political discrimination. <i>See generally</i> 385 F.3d at 23. The defendants in that case \"reassigned several hundred employees, including [the plaintiff].\" <i>Id.</i> at 35. The plaintiff asserted that her reassignment to a lower position was based on improper political discrimination rather than the defendants' claim of a systematic reclassification of existing positions. <i>Id.</i> at 28-29. To demonstrate that the defendants had knowledge of her political affiliation, the plaintiff referred to a single encounter during routine campaign canvassing, and testimony about her prior activities and positions under a previous administration. <i>Id.</i> at 37-38. As to political animus, the plaintiff offered two comments made by the defendants, <i>id.</i> at 36, 38. The plaintiff also presented evidence about her qualifications for the job at issue, and the gradual erosion of her responsibilities when the new administration took charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In concluding that V&#225;zquez-Valent&#237;n presented insufficient evidence to get to the jury on her political discrimination claim, we specified the following deficiencies: (1) she had not presented evidence creating a reasonable inference that the defendants were even aware of her political affiliation when her personnel file was reviewed and she was reassigned to another position; (2) her evidence fell short of proving that she had been treated in a discriminatory manner because of undisputed testimony that she did not meet the statutory procedural requirements for her present position; (3) one of the statements she relied on&#8212;the mayor's comment about \"cleaning house\"&#8212;was not a direct statement about NPP employees; (4) her supervisor's statement of political animus was a stray comment that could not be attributed to the defendant city officials; (5) the actions of her supervisor in failing to provide her with adequate work for five months similarly could not be attributed to the defendants; and (6) importantly, the plaintiff offered no evidence that PDP members were hired to replace the reassigned NPP members. <i>V&#225;zquez-Valent&#237;n,</i> 385 F.3d at 37-40.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Apparently focusing on these deficiencies, the district court saw <i>V&#225;zquez-Valent&#237;n</i> as a baseline for the amount of evidence a political discrimination plaintiff must present in order to reach the jury:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If this case&#8212;if the case of <i>V&#225;zquez-Valent&#237;n</i> did not meet the standard of proof for jury submission . . . then this case, that we are trying now . . . doesn't meet it either. . . . The truth of the matter is that the case of <i>V&#225;zquez</i> . . . contained a lot more evidence of potential discriminatory motives and of a circumstantial nature than the one that we are trying.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's statement is a fair observation as far as it goes. As already noted, there is no evidence in this case of politically discriminatory remarks. There is no evidence of large scale demotions or firings of the members of one political party. But the court's focus on some of the more familiar indicia of political discrimination described in <i>V&#225;zquez-Valent&#237;n</i> may have prevented the district court from recognizing that the evidence of political discrimination presented by Plaintiffs had produced a political discrimination case very different from <i>V&#225;zquez-Valent&#237;n.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. The sufficiency of the evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A plaintiff must typically make four showings to prove a case of political discrimination: (1) the plaintiff and the defendant belong to opposing political affiliations; (2) the defendant has knowledge of the plaintiff's opposing political affiliation; (3) there is a challenged employment action; and (4) \"sufficient evidence, whether direct or circumstantial . . . that political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor . . . that the challenged employment action stemmed from politically based animus.\" <i>Gonz&#225;lez-de-Blasini v. Family Dept.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201167\"><a href=\"/opinion/201167/gonzalez-de-blasini-v-family-department/\"><span class=\"volume\">377</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span>, 85-86 (1st Cir.2004) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs testified, on direct examination, that they were all affiliated with the NPP. They presented enough circumstantial evidence of Santiago and Hern&#225;ndez's affiliation to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that Defendants were affiliated with the PDP. Plaintiffs proffered testimony that their political affiliations were well-known within the CDA itself, and Hern&#225;ndez, one of the Defendants, asked one of the Plaintiffs to identify her political affiliation. Also, Plaintiffs' evidence portrays a relatively small workplace where everyone knew who everyone else was and political affiliations were common office knowledge. Given this evidence, a reasonable jury could conclude that Defendants knew of Plaintiffs' political affiliations. There is no dispute that Plaintiffs were terminated from their career positions at the end of their probationary periods.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, not surprisingly, this appeal turns on the fourth showing required to prove political discrimination&#8212;that political discrimination was a substantial or motivating factor in the challenged employment action. Before evaluating the evidence on this issue for each Plaintiff, we must make some preliminary points applicable to each Plaintiff's case. We are reviewing a district court's decision to grant judgment as a matter of law. As a result, we must evaluate the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, here Plaintiffs, and we draw all reasonable inferences in their favor. <i>See Figueroa-Torres,</i> 232 F.3d at 273. We \"may not take into account the credibility of witnesses, resolve evidentiary conflicts, nor ponder the weight of the evidence introduced at trial.\" <i>Id.</i> That is the province of the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, in political discrimination cases where the defendants present evidence of the non-discriminatory reasons for the adverse employment decisions at issue, the falsity of those reasons can provide circumstantial evidence that political discrimination was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment decision. This proposition is well-established in Title VII law. In <i>Reeves v.

The evidentiary significance of a false explanation for an employment decision is based on a general proposition of evidence law. As the Supreme Court explained in <i>Reeves:</i> \"[s]uch an inference [of falsity] is consistent with the <i>general principle of evidence law that the factfinder is entitled to consider a party's dishonesty about a material fact as `affirmative evidence of guilt.'\" Reeves,</i> 530 U.S. at 147, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087667\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087667/reeves-v-sanderson-plumbing-products-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2097</span></a></span> (emphasis added). This general proposition applies in this case. However, we are not suggesting that a jury's finding that Defendants gave false explanations for their adverse employment decisions would be sufficient alone to establish that political discrimination was a substantial or motivating factor in those employment decisions. We are simply saying that such a finding would be circumstantial evidence of such discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We may also consider the circumstances surrounding the adverse employment decisions affecting the Plaintiffs. Prior to the change in administrations, all three Plaintiffs had uneventful probationary periods with only positive evaluations. Their final evaluations were the only negative marks on their records. These final evaluations were conducted over a brief period of time&#8212;for as little as two weeks (P&#233;rez) to four weeks (Gascot), at a time when Santiago and Hern&#225;ndez faced many other demands for their attention because of the transition in administrations. Although not required to do so, Santiago conceded that he did not take into account Plaintiffs' prior, positive evaluations in reaching his termination decisions. Plaintiffs were never admonished for their alleged performance deficiencies at the time of their occurrences, and they received their negative evaluations on the day of their respective terminations, in contravention of a regulation requiring that the termination and final evaluation \"be given to the employee no less than 10 days before the date of separation.\" Again, we are not suggesting that this evidence alone establishes that political discrimination was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment decision of Defendants. Still, the three employees who described these strikingly similar stories were members of the same political party, now out of power. <i>See, e.g., Rodr&#237;guez-Mar&#237;n v. Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">72</span></span>, 80 (1st Cir.2006) (\"It is suspicious that both of [the NPP plaintiffs] were demoted without being given any notice or opportunity to defend their promotions, especially since the initial explanation offered for the demotions was simply missing documentation. . . . Further, these missing documents mysteriously reappeared after [the plaintiffs] presented their copies of the missing documents. . . . Even after the missing documents were replaced, [the plaintiffs] were not reinstated; rather, other justifications were given for their demotions.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Importantly, Defendants presented no evidence that they were conducting final evaluations of all probationary employees in the CDA. They presented no evidence that these three employees were the only probationary employees in the department. They presented no evidence that they were engaged in a systematic review of the personnel files of all employees in search of hiring or promotion irregularities. Under the circumstances, a jury could conclude that the common denominator that explains the strikingly similar stories of Plaintiffs was their shared political affiliation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without repeating the summaries of the evidence already presented, we turn now to a closer examination of the evidence presented by each Plaintiff, with a particular focus on the points of conflict in the testimony of the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. P&#233;rez</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In her testimony, P&#233;rez described her job duties and responsibilities, said that she performed them well, and noted that all of her prior evaluations during the probationary period were positive. P&#233;rez used a computer in compiling the wage and vacation information for which she was responsible. She said a computer was \"indispensable . . . to do it efficiently\". Hern&#225;ndez painted a different picture of P&#233;rez's performance, stating that she performed her duties deficiently, committed computational errors, insisted unnecessarily on the use of a computer, and was insubordinate when told to cease using a particular computer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">P&#233;rez challenged Hern&#225;ndez's account in several ways. On cross-examination, Hern&#225;ndez acknowledged that she disregarded a regulation requiring that a probationary employee receive the last evaluation ten days before the date of separation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> P&#233;rez received her last evaluation on the day of her separation. Hern&#225;ndez admitted that by not following the applicable regulation prescribing when evaluations are given to an employee, she increased the number of days she had to conduct P&#233;rez's final evaluation from two days to twelve days. With respect to the computational errors attributed to P&#233;rez, Hern&#225;ndez admitted, on questioning by the district court, that other employees could have been responsible for P&#233;rez's errors. On cross-examination, Hern&#225;ndez also acknowledged that she exaggerated the severity of the consequences of any errors P&#233;rez might have committed in her wage calculations. Finally, Hern&#225;ndez admitted that she included in her final evaluation alleged errors that would have been accounted for in the November 16 to December 31 evaluation, thereby inappropriately considering job performance outside of the final evaluation period. (Additionally, these prior evaluations were positive in spite of those errors.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of these challenges to Hern&#225;ndez's account of P&#233;rez's performance deficiencies, and the responsibility of the jury for assessing the credibility of witnesses, we conclude that a reasonable jury could choose to believe P&#233;rez's account of her performance and reject Hern&#225;ndez's account.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Negr&#243;n</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Much like P&#233;rez, Negr&#243;n testified about her job duties and her satisfactory performance of those duties. Also like P&#233;rez, Negr&#243;n discovered the specific objections to her work at the end of the final day of her probationary period, a violation of the ten-day notice required by the regulation prescribing procedures for probationary periods described above. Negr&#243;n also described a number of specific tasks she was asked to perform for Santiago on his arrival as CDA Administrator. The three tasks at issue were: the installation of a new door lock for Santiago's office; the moving of certain furniture and file cabinets; and the repair of an air conditioning duct in Santiago's office. Because of the content of her final probationary evaluation, Negr&#243;n anticipated Santiago's negative account of her performance of these tasks and provided explanations in her direct testimony for the way she performed them. These explanations for her performance were never given directly to Santiago or anyone else at the agency because she was never given the opportunity to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago testified to a starkly different version of Negr&#243;n's performance of these tasks. On cross-examination, Plaintiffs' counsel challenged the basis for Santiago's objections. As to the moving of the furniture and file cabinets, Negr&#243;n had explained that the furniture and file cabinets were moved as fast as possible, and that the delay was caused by the lack of personnel to move the objects. Santiago conceded that Negr&#243;n had to wait for additional personnel because she could not have moved the objects on her own. As to the installation of the lock on Santiago's office door, Negr&#243;n maintained in her direct testimony that the technician installed the lock improperly despite the specific instructions that she provided. When she was notified of this error, she promptly had the lock reinstalled properly. On cross-examination, Santiago was asked whether Negr&#243;n ordered the technician to install the lock backwards. He admitted, \"I didn't say that she did it.\" Instead, he complained that she should have checked the installation when the work was completed. But he also conceded that installing a lock is \"not that complex\" and that it was not necessary for her to observe the entire installation. As to the repair of the office's air conditioning, Santiago acknowledged that the only reason the air conditioning was not fixed was because he refused to provide the written authorization requested by Negr&#243;n. When Plaintiffs' counsel asked Santiago the reason for his refusal, Santiago said that Negr&#243;n's paperwork was \"redundant\" and it would set a bad precedent. He never said the request was improper or against CDA policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on Negr&#243;n's points of contention with Santiago's account of her job performance, including the violation of the ten day requirement, we conclude that a reasonable jury could choose to believe Negr&#243;n's account of her work and reject Santiago's account as a false explanation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Gascot</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like her fellow Plaintiffs, Gascot described a relatively uneventful probationary period. She detailed her duties as head of the managerial/entrepreneurial school and recounted her satisfactory performance of those duties, as evidenced by her prior positive evaluations. Like Negr&#243;n, based on the contents of her final negative evaluation, Gascot anticipated the objections that Santiago had with the performance of her duties. In his evaluation, Santiago stated as reasons for Gascot's dismissal: \"Improper utilization of funds and resources available in the offering of courses, careless in the effective mantenance of the vehicle in the school.\" Later, in response to an interrogatory requesting all of the reasons for Gascot's dismissal, Santiago mentioned only a single reason: her mismanagement of a CDA vehicle. In his deposition testimony, he elaborated to some degree on his dissatisfaction with Gascot's job performance. He referred to Gascot's mishandling of the CDA vehicle; he said that the school's \"courses were ineffective\"; and he said that Gascot \"did not have an organized working plan for the school.\" On direct examination at trial, Santiago significantly expanded on the deficiencies in Gascot's performance, listing a number of other \"plans\" that Gascot had failed to produce, including a \"capacitation plan,\" a \"study of needs,\" and a \"promotional advertising plan.\" On cross-examination, Santiago admitted that his answer to the interrogatory had not included many of the problems with Gascot's performance that he was now describing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Curiously, when Defendants' counsel cross-examined Gascot, he permitted her to testify that she had prepared a training and service plan for the school and had submitted it as part of transition procedures to Santiago. Moreover, Gascot stated in response to that same cross-examination that Santiago \"had no criteria for rendering\" his negative evaluation because \"[h]e did not meet with me and ask for the plan. He did not ask me for the study or the research of needs. He didn't . . . [say] let's see where are the studies. If he had asked me I would have given them all to him and would have avoided all of this.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross-examination, Santiago admitted to receiving a transition report, introduced into evidence by Plaintiff's counsel, which included a document that Santiago identified as a \"working plan\" for the school, though he claimed to have never seen that working plan before. This exchange suggested that Santiago criticized Gascot for her failure to plan, yet he had received a document from her reflecting such planning. Additionally, Santiago conceded that while he criticized Gascot for not updating the entrepreneurial school's curriculum, that curriculum had remained unchanged at the time of Santiago's departure from the CDA one year later, well after Gascot's departure. Also, he acknowledged that the contents of the transition report he received called into question Santiago's claim that the disrepair of the CDA vehicle was caused by Gascot's neglect because the vehicle was already old when Gascot assumed her responsibilities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of these challenges to Santiago's account of Gascot's performance, we conclude that a reasonable jury could choose to believe Gascot's account of her performance and reject Santiago's account as a false explanation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. Summary</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In essence, Plaintiffs described satisfactory job performances throughout their probationary periods until the new administration arrived with a different political affiliation. Then they received negative evaluations based on a limited period of observation. Those negative evaluations were presented to them on the last day of their probationary periods when they were terminated from their positions, in violation of a regulation requiring that such evaluations be presented to the probationary employees ten days before separation. In their testimony, Defendants explained the deficiencies in the job performance of Plaintiffs justifying these adverse employment decisions. In both their direct testimony, which anticipated some of the explanations by Defendants, and in cross-examination of Defendants, Plaintiffs challenged the authenticity of these accounts. In the presence of this conflicting testimony, a reasonable jury could believe Plaintiffs and disbelieve Defendants. As we have already explained, the fact that a jury could find that Defendants gave false explanations has evidentiary significance. <i>See Reeves,</i> 530 U.S. at 147, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087667\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087667/reeves-v-sanderson-plumbing-products-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2097</span></a></span> (stating that \"the factfinder is entitled to consider a party's dishonesty about a material fact as `affirmative evidence of guilt'\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, Plaintiffs cannot establish their case of political discrimination solely by persuading a jury that Defendants' explanations were false. Plaintiffs have the burden of establishing specifically that political discrimination was a substantial or motivating factor for the adverse employment action. <i>See Acevedo-Diaz,</i> 1 F.3d at 66. On this issue, there was other relevant evidence that a jury could consider to supplement a jury finding of false explanations for the adverse employment decisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These three dismissals all happened within one month of a change in political administrations. The temporal proximity between a change in political administrations and an adverse employment action is relevant to the issue of whether political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment decision. <i>See Acevedo-Diaz,</i> 1 F.3d at 69 (\"<i>Mere</i> temporal proximity between a change of administration and a public employee's dismissal is insufficient to establish discriminatory animus\" (emphasis added).). Moreover, a jury could conclude that it was more than coincidence that the three probationary employees who lost their jobs were members of the same political party now out of power. For unexplained reasons, these three employees became the focus of hurried evaluations that, in some important respects, did not conform to the regulations for such evaluations of probationary employees. These hurried evaluations gave the appearance of a coordinated effort to rid the agency of three employees who shared a different political affiliation than the party now in power.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, a reasonable fact finder could conclude that Plaintiffs have established that political discrimination was a substantial or motivating factor in the loss of their jobs. Therefore, it was an error of law for the court to grant Defendants' second Rule 50(a) motion and keep from the jury P&#233;rez's claim against Hern&#225;ndez, and the claims of Negr&#243;n and Gascot against Santiago.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, we <i>affirm</i> the district court's dismissal of P&#233;rez's claim against Santiago.

There, we reviewed a district court's denial of the defendants' motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a). The defendants asserted that the plaintiff had presented insufficient evidence of political discrimination to permit the case to go to the jury. We agreed. <i>See generally</i> 385 F.3d at 23. However, in order to conduct that evaluation of the defendants' motion, we excused the defendants' failure to preserve that ground pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(b), which requires renewal of a Rule 50(a) motion after the jury has returned a verdict. In <i>Unitherm,</i> the Supreme Court ruled that a party must renew its Rule 50(a) motion pursuant to Rule 50(b), or that ground for appeal is waived. <i>See generally</i> 126 S.Ct. at 980.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs do not appeal these dismissals prompted by Defendants' first Rule 50(a) motion.

These claims also did not survive the district court's first Rule 50(a) ruling, and Plaintiffs did not appeal that ruling.
