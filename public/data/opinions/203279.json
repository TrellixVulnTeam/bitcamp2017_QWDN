Defendant-appellant Omar\n\nGenao-Sánchez (Genao) challenges the district court's refusal to\n\nconduct a sentencing hearing after vacation of some, but not all,\n\nof the original counts of conviction.             See United States v.\n\nRodríguez-Marrero, 390 F.3d 1, 32 (1st Cir. 2004).1       He contends,\n\namong other things, that the failure to resentence him contravened\n\nthis court's mandate.   Concluding, as we do, that the lower court\n\nerred, we remand for resentencing.\n\n          We rehearse here only those facts necessary to place this\n\nappeal into perspective.   The reader who hungers for more exegetic\n\ndetail may consult our earlier opinion.     See id. at 5-11.\n\n          On December 17, 1997, a federal grand jury charged the\n\nappellant with conspiracy to possess more than five kilograms of\n\ncocaine and other drugs with intent to distribute, in violation of\n\n21 U.S.C. §§ 846 and 841(a)(1).     The grand jury twice superseded\n\nthe indictment.   Pertinently, in July 2000 it handed up a second\n\nsuperseding   indictment   that   charged   the    appellant   with   two\n\nadditional crimes: conspiring to use a firearm in furtherance of\n\nthe aforementioned drug conspiracy, death resulting, in violation\n\nof 18 U.S.C. § 924(o), and aiding and abetting the commission of\n\nthat crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2 and 924(j).                For\n\nsimplicity's sake, we shall refer to these counts sequentially as\n\n\n     1\n      Rodríguez-Marrero was one of two codefendants tried with the\nappellant.   Neither of those codefendants is a party to this\nappeal.\n\n                                  -2-\n\fcount one (the drug conspiracy count), count two (the firearms\n\ncount), and count three (the aiding and abetting count).     After a\n\nprotracted trial, a jury pronounced the appellant guilty on all\n\nthree counts.\n\n          The district court convened a disposition hearing on\n\nMarch 18, 2002.     Working under the then-mandatory sentencing\n\nguidelines, the court grouped the three counts of conviction.      See\n\nUSSG §3D1.2 (authorizing grouping, for sentencing purposes, of\n\ncounts that involve the same harm).     The sentencing guidelines\n\ndirected the court to use the offense level for the most serious of\n\nthe grouped counts in fixing the base offense level (BOL).   See id.\n\nBecause counts two and three involved the death of a person, those\n\ncounts triggered a BOL of 43.   See id. §2A1.1.   Using that BOL for\n\nthe grouped counts, the court sentenced the appellant to life\n\nimprisonment on each count of conviction.         The court ran the\n\nsentences concurrently.\n\n          On direct review, we vacated the appellant's convictions\n\non counts two and three due to errors in the admission of evidence.\n\nSee Rodríguez-Marrero, 390 F.3d at 15-21.    At the same time, we\n\naffirmed the appellant's conviction on count one.     Id. at 21.   We\n\nconcluded:\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we VACATE Genao's\n          convictions on counts two and three of the\n          second superseding indictment and REMAND to\n          the district court for a new trial on those\n          charges if the government wishes to so\n\n\n                                -3-\n\f            proceed, and for resentencing.     We AFFIRM\n            Genao's conviction on count one . . . .\n\nId. at 32.\n\n            Following remand, the government eschewed a retrial on\n\neither count two or count three.           However, it urged the district\n\ncourt to allow the life sentence previously imposed on count one to\n\nstand without conducting a new sentencing hearing.               The appellant\n\nopposed    this   suggestion,     expostulating    that    our    decision   in\n\nRodríguez-Marrero mandated the holding of a new sentencing hearing.\n\n            The government convinced the district court.              Pointing\n\nout that the Rodríguez-Marrero panel had affirmed the appellant's\n\nconviction on count one, the court opted to \"trash out\" the\n\nsentences on counts two and three but to leave intact the existing\n\nsentence on count one.          The court accomplished this result by\n\nentering an amended judgment, without convening a new sentencing\n\nhearing.    This timely appeal ensued.\n\n            Before us, the appellant asserts that the district court\n\ncommitted    reversible   error    when    it   indulged   the    government's\n\npreference and trimmed the original judgment without sentencing him\n\nanew. He reasons that eschewing a fresh sentencing hearing was not\n\nonly contrary to this court's mandate but also prejudicial because,\n\ngiven the vacation of the convictions on counts two and three and\n\nthe Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Booker, 543 U.S.\n\n220 (2005), he was no longer subject to an automatic life sentence.\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f          The    government   counters     that   the   district   court's\n\ndecision to leave the sentence on count one intact was a proper\n\nexercise of its discretion because, notwithstanding the vacation of\n\nthe convictions on counts two and three, the court could have\n\ncross-referenced      the   first-degree     murder     guideline,        USSG\n\n§2D1.1(d)(1), and meted out a life sentence on count one alone — a\n\nsentence that would have been within the statutory maximum. See 21\n\nU.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A).\n\n          In the first instance, our analysis must turn on an\n\ninterpretation   of   the   mandate   in   Rodríguez-Marrero.        If   the\n\nopinion, fairly read, called for resentencing, then the outcome of\n\nthis appeal is dictated by the law of the case.                 This is a\n\nquintessentially legal question, so our review is plenary.                See\n\nConley v. United States, 323 F.3d 7, 22 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n          The law of the case doctrine contains two branches.             One\n\nbranch, not implicated here, deals with when a legal determination\n\nmade by a court in a civil or criminal case establishes the law of\n\nthat case throughout the balance of litigation in that court. See,\n\ne.g., Ellis v. United States, 313 F.3d 636, 646 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n          This appeal implicates the second branch of the doctrine:\n\nthe so-called \"mandate rule.\"     That rule \"prevents relitigation in\n\nthe trial court of matters that were explicitly or implicitly\n\ndecided by an earlier appellate decision in the same case.\" United\n\nStates v. Moran, 393 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2004).          In interpreting\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fthe mandate, the district court \"must implement both the letter and\n\nthe spirit of the mandate, taking into account the appellate\n\ncourt's opinion and the circumstances it embraces.\"           United States\n\nv. Connell, 6 F.3d 27, 30 (1st Cir. 1993) (quoting United States v.\n\nKikumura, 947 F.2d 72, 76 (3d Cir. 1991)).\n\n           This branch of the law of the case doctrine has obvious\n\npertinence here. If, as the appellant insists, our earlier opinion\n\ndirects resentencing on count one, the mandate rule would require\n\nthe district court to hold a new sentencing hearing — and a failure\n\nto abide by that imperative would be error.          We therefore parse the\n\noperative language of our prior opinion to discern the contours of\n\nits mandate.\n\n           Such an exercise makes pellucid that we remanded this\n\ncase to the district court to resentence the appellant on count\n\none.      The   district   court    was    instructed    to   \"vacate    [the\n\nappellant's] convictions on counts two and three.\"               Rodríguez-\n\nMarrero, 390 F.3d at 32.     It was told that it would re-acquire the\n\ncase \"for a new trial on those charges if the government wishes to\n\nso proceed, and for resentencing.\"           Id.     This language clearly\n\nconveys two distinct commands.        First, it instructs the district\n\ncourt to wipe out the judgments on counts two and three and to\n\nretry those counts if the government elects to press forward.\n\nSecond,    it   independently      instructs   the    district   court     to\n\n\"resentenc[e]\" the appellant.          Since the only conviction left\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fstanding in the wake of our earlier opinion was the conviction on\n\ncount one, the directive to resentence necessarily referred to that\n\ncount.   A mandate, like a statute, should be read so that to the\n\nmaximum extent practicable every word and phrase has meaning; and\n\nany other reading of Rodríguez-Marrero would render superfluous our\n\ninstruction to \"resentenc[e]\" the appellant.\n\n          Were there some ambiguity about this point — and we do\n\nnot think that there is — the very next sentence in the concluding\n\nparagraph of the Rodríguez-Marrero opinion eliminates any vestige\n\nof a doubt.    Although we affirmed \"the convictions and sentences\"\n\nof the appellant's codefendants on count one, we affirmed only the\n\nappellant's \"conviction\" on that count.           Id.   Conspicuously absent\n\nwas any language presuming to affirm the appellant's sentence.\n\nThat omission can only be viewed as deliberate.\n\n          We    add    a    coda.     The    prosecution,    which   urged   a\n\nmisconstruction   of       our   mandate   on   the   district   court,   bears\n\nconsiderable responsibility for what ensued.              In all events, the\n\nfailure to resentence the appellant as the Rodríguez-Marrero panel\n\nhad directed was not harmless.         We explain briefly.\n\n          To begin, the appellant's guideline sentencing range\n\n(GSR) may or may not differ from the GSR originally calculated by\n\nthe district court.         With the grouped counts dropped out of the\n\nequation, the appellant's GSR will now depend on the district\n\n\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fcourt's factfinding.2             See, e.g., United States v. O'Brien, 435\n\nF.3d 36, 41 (1st Cir. 2006); United States v. Vega Molina, 407 F.3d\n\n511, 535 (1st Cir. 2005); see also United States v. Phillips, 219\n\nF.3d 404, 420 (5th Cir. 2000) (vacating entire sentence on all\n\ncounts of conviction because the sentence was calculated through a\n\ngrouping that contained vacated counts).\n\n                Even apart from changes in the GSR, the dropped counts\n\nalter        the     dimensions    of   the     sentencing    \"package.\"     That\n\ncircumstance, in and of itself, may lead a sentencing court to\n\nimpose a different sentence.                   See United States v. Pimienta-\n\nRedondo, 874 F.2d 9, 17 (1st Cir. 1989) (en banc) (affirming a\n\ndifferent sentence given by the district court at resentencing on\n\na single count of conviction after vacation of a conviction on a\n\nparallel count).\n\n                Perhaps most important, the sentencing guidelines, which\n\nwere        viewed    as   mandatory    when    the   appellant   was   originally\n\nsentenced, are now interpreted as advisory.                  See Booker, 543 U.S.\n\nat 240-41.           This means that whether or not the GSR remains the\n\nsame, the sentencing court has much greater latitude in shaping a\n\nparticular sentence.           See Gall v. United States, 128 S. Ct. 586,\n\n\n\n\n        2\n      In the absence of some upward adjustment, the conviction for\nconspiring to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine would\ncarry a BOL of 32. With a criminal history category of III, the\nGSR under the advisory guidelines would be 151-188 months. See\nUSSG ch. 5, pt. A (sentencing table) (2002).\n\n                                          -8-\n\f591 (2007); United States v. Martin, 520 F.3d 87, 91 (1st Cir.\n\n2008).\n\n          To be sure, the government is correct when it insists\n\nthat the district court could still sentence the appellant to life\n\nimprisonment if it found that a murder had been committed during\n\nand in furtherance of the drug conspiracy.   See USSG §2D1.1(d)(1).\n\nBut the district court has never made such a finding — and the\n\nappellant, whose right of allocution must be held sacrosanct, was\n\nentitled to contest that point at a new sentencing hearing.3   See\n\nUnited States v. De Alba Pagán, 33 F.3d 125, 129 (1st Cir. 1994)\n\n(explaining that \"[t]he right of allocution affords a criminal\n\ndefendant the opportunity to make a final plea to the judge on his\n\nown behalf prior to sentencing\"); see also id. at 130 (warning that\n\n\"if the trial court fails to afford a defendant either the right of\n\nallocution . . . or its functional equivalent, vacation of the\n\nensuing sentence must follow automatically\").\n\n          To sum up, the failure to convene a new sentencing\n\nhearing deprived the appellant of the opportunity to argue his\n\nposition both as to matters of fact relevant to sentencing and as\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      The district court did say, subsequent to the order of\nremand, that it had made the necessary factual findings at the\noriginal disposition hearing. However, close perscrutation of the\nrecord reveals no such factfinding. To the contrary, the court\nrelied on the now-vacated convictions (counts two and three) to\noverrule the appellant's objection to use of murder as an integer\nin the sentencing calculus.\n\n                               -9-\n\fto the appropriate sentence to be imposed.    The error, therefore,\n\nwas prejudicial.\n\n          We need go no further.4   Because the district court erred\n\nin failing to resentence the appellant on the sole remaining count\n\nof conviction, we vacate the amended judgment and remand to the\n\ndistrict court with instructions to hold a resentencing hearing on\n\ncount one.    We take no view as to the appropriate sentence to be\n\nimposed; in the first instance, that is for the district court to\n\ndecide.\n\n\n\nSo Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      In a pro se brief, the appellant argues that his life\nsentence violates the rule of Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466,\n490 (2000).   But \"Apprendi error arises only if the defendant\nreceives a sentence beyond the default statutory maximum for the\noffense of conviction.\" United States v. Jiminez, 498 F.3d 82, 87\n(1st Cir. 2007).    In this case, a life sentence is within the\nstatutory maximum. See 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A).\n\n                               -10-\n\f",

We\n\nconcluded:\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we VACATE Genao's\n          convictions on counts two and three of the\n          second superseding indictment and REMAND to\n          the district court for a new trial on those\n          charges if the government wishes to so\n\n\n                                -3-\n\f            proceed, and for resentencing.     We AFFIRM\n            Genao's conviction on count one . . . .\n\nId. at 32.\n\n            Following remand, the government eschewed a retrial on\n\neither count two or count three.           However, it urged the district\n\ncourt to allow the life sentence previously imposed on count one to\n\nstand without conducting a new sentencing hearing.               The appellant\n\nopposed    this   suggestion,     expostulating    that    our    decision   in\n\nRodríguez-Marrero mandated the holding of a new sentencing hearing.\n\n            The government convinced the district court.              Pointing\n\nout that the Rodríguez-Marrero panel had affirmed the appellant's\n\nconviction on count one, the court opted to \"trash out\" the\n\nsentences on counts two and three but to leave intact the existing\n\nsentence on count one.          The court accomplished this result by\n\nentering an amended judgment, without convening a new sentencing\n\nhearing.    This timely appeal ensued.\n\n            Before us, the appellant asserts that the district court\n\ncommitted    reversible   error    when    it   indulged   the    government's\n\npreference and trimmed the original judgment without sentencing him\n\nanew. He reasons that eschewing a fresh sentencing hearing was not\n\nonly contrary to this court's mandate but also prejudicial because,\n\ngiven the vacation of the convictions on counts two and three and\n\nthe Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Booker, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">220</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2005), he was no longer subject to an automatic life sentence.\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f          The    government   counters     that   the   district   court's\n\ndecision to leave the sentence on count one intact was a proper\n\nexercise of its discretion because, notwithstanding the vacation of\n\nthe convictions on counts two and three, the court could have\n\ncross-referenced      the   first-degree     murder     guideline,        USSG\n\n§2D1.1(d)(1), and meted out a life sentence on count one alone — a\n\nsentence that would have been within the statutory maximum. See 21\n\nU.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A).\n\n          In the first instance, our analysis must turn on an\n\ninterpretation   of   the   mandate   in   Rodríguez-Marrero.        If   the\n\nopinion, fairly read, called for resentencing, then the outcome of\n\nthis appeal is dictated by the law of the case.                 This is a\n\nquintessentially legal question, so our review is plenary.                See\n\nConley v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781268\"><a href=\"/opinion/781268/kenneth-conley-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">323</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 22 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n          The law of the case doctrine contains two branches.             One\n\nbranch, not implicated here, deals with when a legal determination\n\nmade by a court in a civil or criminal case establishes the law of\n\nthat case throughout the balance of litigation in that court. See,\n\ne.g., Ellis v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200248\"><a href=\"/opinion/200248/ellis-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">313</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">636</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 646 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n          This appeal implicates the second branch of the doctrine:\n\nthe so-called \"mandate rule.\"     That rule \"prevents relitigation in\n\nthe trial court of matters that were explicitly or implicitly\n\ndecided by an earlier appellate decision in the same case.\" United\n\nStates v. Moran, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201379\"><a href=\"/opinion/201379/united-states-v-moran/\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 7 (1st Cir. 2004).          In interpreting\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fthe mandate, the district court \"must implement both the letter and\n\nthe spirit of the mandate, taking into account the appellate\n\ncourt's opinion and the circumstances it embraces.\"           United States\n\nv. Connell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194971\"><a href=\"/opinion/194971/united-states-v-connell/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 30 (1st Cir. 1993) (quoting United States v.\n\nKikumura, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"570414\"><a href=\"/opinion/570414/united-states-v-yu-kikumura/\"><span class=\"volume\">947</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">72</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 76 (3d Cir. 1991)).\n\n           This branch of the law of the case doctrine has obvious\n\npertinence here. If, as the appellant insists, our earlier opinion\n\ndirects resentencing on count one, the mandate rule would require\n\nthe district court to hold a new sentencing hearing — and a failure\n\nto abide by that imperative would be error.          We therefore parse the\n\noperative language of our prior opinion to discern the contours of\n\nits mandate.\n\n           Such an exercise makes pellucid that we remanded this\n\ncase to the district court to resentence the appellant on count\n\none.      The   district   court    was    instructed    to   \"vacate    [the\n\nappellant's] convictions on counts two and three.\"               Rodríguez-\n\nMarrero, 390 F.3d at 32.     It was told that it would re-acquire the\n\ncase \"for a new trial on those charges if the government wishes to\n\nso proceed, and for resentencing.\"           Id.     This language clearly\n\nconveys two distinct commands.        First, it instructs the district\n\ncourt to wipe out the judgments on counts two and three and to\n\nretry those counts if the government elects to press forward.\n\nSecond,    it   independently      instructs   the    district   court     to\n\n\"resentenc[e]\" the appellant.          Since the only conviction left\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fstanding in the wake of our earlier opinion was the conviction on\n\ncount one, the directive to resentence necessarily referred to that\n\ncount.   A mandate, like a statute, should be read so that to the\n\nmaximum extent practicable every word and phrase has meaning; and\n\nany other reading of Rodríguez-Marrero would render superfluous our\n\ninstruction to \"resentenc[e]\" the appellant.\n\n          Were there some ambiguity about this point — and we do\n\nnot think that there is — the very next sentence in the concluding\n\nparagraph of the Rodríguez-Marrero opinion eliminates any vestige\n\nof a doubt.    Although we affirmed \"the convictions and sentences\"\n\nof the appellant's codefendants on count one, we affirmed only the\n\nappellant's \"conviction\" on that count.           Id.   Conspicuously absent\n\nwas any language presuming to affirm the appellant's sentence.\n\nThat omission can only be viewed as deliberate.\n\n          We    add    a    coda.     The    prosecution,    which   urged   a\n\nmisconstruction   of       our   mandate   on   the   district   court,   bears\n\nconsiderable responsibility for what ensued.              In all events, the\n\nfailure to resentence the appellant as the Rodríguez-Marrero panel\n\nhad directed was not harmless.         We explain briefly.\n\n          To begin, the appellant's guideline sentencing range\n\n(GSR) may or may not differ from the GSR originally calculated by\n\nthe district court.         With the grouped counts dropped out of the\n\nequation, the appellant's GSR will now depend on the district\n\n\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fcourt's factfinding.2             See, e.g., United States v.

See Booker, 543 U.S.\n\nat 240-41.           This means that whether or not the GSR remains the\n\nsame, the sentencing court has much greater latitude in shaping a\n\nparticular sentence.

See USSG §2D1.1(d)(1).\n\nBut the district court has never made such a finding — and the\n\nappellant, whose right of allocution must be held sacrosanct, was\n\nentitled to contest that point at a new sentencing hearing.3   See\n\nUnited States v.

However, close perscrutation of the\nrecord reveals no such factfinding. To the contrary, the court\nrelied on the now-vacated convictions (counts two and three) to\noverrule the appellant's objection to use of murder as an integer\nin the sentencing calculus.\n\n                               -9-\n\fto the appropriate sentence to be imposed.
