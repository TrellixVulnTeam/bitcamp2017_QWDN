This is a petition for review of\n\na December 17, 2004 order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA)\n\ndenying a motion under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reconsider its order of\n\nJuly   15,   2004.      The    July   15       order   affirmed    and    adopted   an\n\nImmigration        Judge's     (IJ's)      decision          denying     petitioner's\n\napplication for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under\n\nthe Convention Against Torture (CAT).                  In addition, the July 15\n\norder affirmed the IJ's decision not to grant a continuance,\n\nrejected     the   claim     that   the    IJ    had   not    given    petitioner   an\n\nimpartial and fair hearing, and noted that evidence proffered to\n\nthe BIA on appeal was neither new nor previously unavailable.                       The\n\nBIA refused to revisit the July 15 decision, stating in its\n\nDecember 17 order that petitioner had not met the requirements for\n\na motion to reconsider.             Because the December 17 order did not\n\nconstitute an abuse of discretion, we deny the petition for review.\n\n                                          I.\n\n             Petitioner Kate Asemota is a native and citizen of\n\nNigeria.     In February 2002, she applied for asylum, withholding of\n\nremoval, and relief under the CAT.                 In April of that year, the\n\nformer INS1 initiated removal proceedings against Asemota.                     On the\n\nvery day the hearing on asylum and removal was to occur, Asemota\n\n\n1\n    On March 1, 2003, the relevant functions of the INS were\ntransferred to the Department of Homeland Security, and the INS\nsubsequently ceased to exist. See Homeland Security Act of 2002,\nPub. L. No. 107-296, § 471, 116 Stat. 2135, 2205 (codified as\namended at 6 U.S.C. § 291(a)).\n\n                                          -2-\n\frequested a continuance.       The IJ denied this request and denied\n\nAsemota's application for relief.\n\n           Asemota timely appealed to the BIA, which adopted and\n\naffirmed the IJ's decision. Asemota then timely filed a motion for\n\nreconsideration of that order.          On December 17, 2004, the BIA\n\ndenied that motion.      This timely petition for review of the BIA's\n\ndenial of the motion to reconsider followed.\n\n                                  II.\n\n           Asemota makes some arguments that could be construed as\n\nan attempt to attack the BIA's July 15, 2004 order.         She failed to\n\ntimely petition for review of that order, so we lack jurisdiction\n\nto review it.   See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(1) (petitions for review of\n\nfinal orders of removal must be filed within 30 days); Ven v.\n\nAshcroft, 386 F.3d 357, 359-60 (1st Cir. 2004) (\"A motion to reopen\n\nor reconsider does not toll the period for filing a petition for\n\njudicial   review   of   the   underlying   order   of   deportation;   in\n\nimmigration cases the time to appeal denial orders continues to run\n\ndespite the filing of motions to reopen or reconsider the denial of\n\nasylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT.\").\n\nThus, the only issue before us is the denial of the motion to\n\nreconsider.\n\n           Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2, a party filing a motion to\n\nreconsider must \"specify[] the errors of fact or law in the prior\n\nBoard decision\" and must support the claim of error with \"pertinent\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fauthority.\" 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1). Under BIA precedent, a party\n\nfiling   a   motion      to   reconsider     must    present   additional   legal\n\narguments, a change of law, or an argument or aspect of the case\n\nthat was overlooked.          See Matter of Cerna, 20 I. & N. Dec. 399, 403\n\nn.2 (BIA 1991).2      Even if the prerequisites for reconsideration are\n\nmet,   the   BIA   has    discretion    to    deny    the   motion.     8   C.F.R.\n\n§ 1003.2(a).\n\n             Our review of the BIA's denial of petitioner's motion to\n\nreconsider is for abuse of discretion.                See INS v. Doherty, 502\n\nU.S. 314, 323-24 (1992); Ven, 386 F.3d at 360.                  We will find an\n\nabuse of discretion only where the \"the denial was made without a\n\n'rational    explanation,        inexplicably       departed   from   established\n\npolicies, or rested on an impermissible basis' (such as race).\"\n\nZhang v. INS, 348 F.3d 289, 293 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting Nascimento\n\nv. INS, 274 F.3d 26, 28 (1st Cir. 2001) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted)).\n\n             We have reviewed the arguments made by Asemota in her\n\nmotion to reconsider before the BIA.                 Asemota urged the BIA to\n\n2\n   In her brief to this court, petitioner nowhere challenges the\nthree-pronged test applied by the BIA in deciding whether to grant\nher motion to reconsider. Rather, she argues that the BIA \"failed\nto adhere to its own precedents, and did not provide any reasoning\nfor departing from those policies and precedents.\" The BIA clearly\napplied its own precedent, Matter of Cerna, in denying the motion\nto reconsider. The BIA has applied this same three-prong test in\nother cases. See Sousa v. Ashcroft, 393 F.3d 271, 274-75 (1st Cir.\n2005). As there was no departure from precedent and petitioner has\nnot challenged that precedent, the only question is whether the BIA\nabused its discretion in the manner in which it applied the\nrequirements. As we explain in the text, it did not.\n\n                                       -4-\n\freconsider two things: first, its affirmance of the IJ's denial of\n\nthe continuance, and second, its refusal to reverse the IJ's asylum\n\ndecision on the grounds of the IJ's \"combative role.\"               The BIA\n\ndenied Asemota's motion on the ground that it met none of the\n\nprerequisites for the granting of a motion to reconsider.                  We\n\nagree.\n\n              As to the denial of the continuance, Asemota's motion\n\nfails to satisfy any of the three requirements embodied in BIA\n\nprecedent and not challenged by petitioner: first, it does not\n\npresent additional legal arguments, but merely reiterates ones made\n\nin petitioner's earlier appeal to the BIA; second, it does not\n\nmention any change of law; and third, it does not suggest that any\n\nargument or aspect of the case was overlooked.          There was thus no\n\nabuse    of   discretion   in   the   BIA's   denial   of   the   motion   to\n\nreconsider.\n\n              The \"combative role\" claim fails for similar reasons.\n\nThis portion of the motion fails the BIA's unchallenged three-prong\n\ntest for motions to reconsider: first, at most Asemota reargued\n\npreviously argued points; second, she mentioned no change of law;\n\nand third, she did not suggest that any argument or aspect of the\n\ncase was overlooked.       Asemota's motion to reconsider highlights\n\nportions of the transcript that in her view showed improper conduct\n\nby the IJ, but the BIA had thoroughly addressed the \"combativeness\"\n\nissue -- and the lack of support for it in the record -- in its\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fJuly 15, 2004 decision.   Therefore, as with the continuance issue,\n\nthere was no abuse of discretion in the BIA's denial of the motion\n\nto reconsider.\n\n          Asemota's attempts in her brief to this court to present\n\na new claim that \"the BIA interfered with [her] right to a reasoned\n\nopinion\" are unexhausted, and so not before us, and in any event\n\nfrivolous.\n\n                              III.\n\n          We deny the petition for review.\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f",

Asemota urged the BIA to reconsider two things: first, its affirmance of the IJ's denial of the continuance, and second, its refusal to reverse the IJ's asylum decision on the grounds of the IJ's \"combative role.\" The BIA denied Asemota's motion on the ground that it met none of the prerequisites for the granting of a motion to reconsider. We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the denial of the continuance, Asemota's motion fails to satisfy any of the three requirements embodied in BIA precedent and not challenged by petitioner: first, it does not present additional legal arguments, but merely reiterates ones made in petitioner's earlier appeal to the BIA; second, it does not mention any change of law; and third, it does not suggest that any argument or aspect of the case was overlooked. There was thus no abuse of discretion in the BIA's denial of the motion to reconsider.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"combative role\" claim fails for similar reasons. This portion of the motion fails the BIA's unchallenged three-prong test for motions to reconsider: first, at most Asemota reargued previously argued points; second, she mentioned no change of law; and third, she did not suggest that any argument or aspect of the case was overlooked. Asemota's motion to reconsider highlights portions of the transcript that in her view showed improper conduct by the IJ, but the BIA had thoroughly addressed the \"combativeness\" issue &#8212; and the lack of support for it in the record &#8212; in its July 15, 2004 decision. Therefore, as with the continuance issue, there was no abuse of discretion in the BIA's denial of the motion to reconsider.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Asemota's attempts in her brief to this court to present a new claim that \"the BIA interfered with [her] right to a reasoned opinion\" are unexhausted, and so not before us, and in any event frivolous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We <i>deny</i> the petition for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> On March 1, 2003, the relevant functions of the INS were transferred to the Department of Homeland Security, and the INS subsequently ceased to exist<i>See</i> Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub.L.

Rather, she argues that the BIA \"failed to adhere to its own precedents, and did not provide any reasoning for departing from those policies and precedents.\" The BIA clearly applied its own precedent,<i>Matter of Cerna,</i> in denying the motion to reconsider. The BIA has applied this same three-prong test in other cases. <i>See Sousa v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201396\"><a href=\"/opinion/201396/sousa-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">271</span></a></span>, 274-75 (1st Cir.2005). As there was no departure from precedent and petitioner has not challenged that precedent, the only question is whether the BIA abused its discretion in the manner in which it applied the requirements. As we explain in the text, it did not.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
