Patti B. Saris, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                  Boudin, John R. Gibson,* and Howard,\n                            Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Martin J. Vogelbaum, with whom Charles P. McGinty and\nFederal Defender Office, were on brief, for appellant.\n     Mark T. Quinlivan, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief,\nfor appellee.\n\n\n\n                            March 30, 2009\n\n\n\n\n*\n    Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f            HOWARD, Circuit Judge.      This case presents a recurring\n\nissue:    whether, for purposes of sentencing a defendant under the\n\nArmed Career Criminal Act (ACCA)1, the charging language \"did\n\nassault and beat\" in a Massachusetts state court criminal complaint\n\nestablishes, in the absence of any other cognizable source of\n\ninformation, that a defendant committed the type of assault and\n\nbattery under Massachusetts law that qualifies as a \"violent\n\nfelony.\"     See United States v. Holloway, 499 F.3d 114, 118 (1st\n\nCir. 2007); see also id. at 116, 118 (recognizing that, under\n\nMassachusetts law, assault and battery may be of two separate\n\ntypes, \"offensive\" and \"harmful\" assault and battery, and that the\n\nlatter type qualifies as a violent felony under the ACCA).\n\n            On four prior occasions we have determined that the \"did\n\nassault and beat\" charging language suffices to identify the\n\n\"harmful\" brand of assault and battery, qualifying the offense as\n\na violent felony under the ACCA or a \"crime of violence\" under the\n\ncareer offender provision of the sentencing guidelines, U.S.S.G. §\n\n4B1.1.     Holloway, 499 F.3d at 118; United States v. Estevez, 419\n\nF.3d 77, 82 (1st Cir. 2005); United States v. Santos, 363 F.3d 19,\n\n24 (1st Cir. 2004);       United States v. Mangos, 134 F.3d 460, 464\n\n(1st Cir. 1998).2\n\n\n1\n    18 U.S.C. § 924(e).\n2\n  We have made clear that \"the definitions of 'violent felony' in\nthe ACCA and 'crime of violence' in U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1 are\nessentially the same, and that we may look to cases dealing with\n\n                                  -2-\n\f          On the basis of three prior Massachusetts assault and\n\nbattery convictions, the sentencing court in this case classified\n\nthe appellant, Pablo Rivera, as an armed career criminal under the\n\nACCA. The district court relied on \"did assault and beat\" charging\n\nlanguage in concluding that each of Rivera's three assault and\n\nbattery convictions was for the \"harmful,\" violent type of assault\n\nand battery.\n\n          In a familiar argument, Rivera says that this charging\n\nlanguage is mere statutory boilerplate and thus fails sufficiently\n\nto establish that he was convicted of the violent type of assault\n\nand battery on those three prior occasions.   As the district court\n\nrecognized, we have rejected this precise argument on a number of\n\noccasions, most recently in Holloway. Id. at 118; Santos, 419 F.3d\n\nat 24.   Nevertheless, on appeal Rivera seeks to distinguish this\n\ncase from the previous ones.     He notes that, unlike the other\n\ndefendants, he presented to the district court affidavits from both\n\na current and retired clerk in the Massachusetts state court, each\n\nof whom attested that the \"did assault and beat\" charging language\n\nis used in all assault and battery cases regardless of which type\n\nof assault and battery is being charged by the state.\n\n          Whatever evidentiary value these affidavits might have\n\nin the district court under other circumstances, Rivera's argument\n\n\n\neither to inform our categorical inquiry.\"    Holloway, 499 F.3d at\n188 (citations omitted).\n\n                               -3-\n\fto us is unavailing in light of binding precedent.                     Nothing in\n\nthose decisions appears to leave open the argument Rivera presents.\n\nIn fact, the opposite seems to be true.           See Santos, 363 F.3d at 19\n\n(\"We do not agree with the Seventh Circuit's basic premise that\n\n'boilerplate     language'     alleging    an   assault    and   battery    under\n\nMassachusetts criminal law is insufficient to deem a subsequent\n\nconviction a crime of violence under § 4B1.2.\").             Moreover, Rivera\n\nhas failed to identify a fresh development in the law that would\n\nallow us to disregard circuit precedent. See Holloway, 499 F.3d at\n\n118.3\n\n            To   be   sure,    classifying      Rivera's   three   assault     and\n\nbattery   convictions     as    violent    felonies    under     the    ACCA   has\n\nsignificant sentencing consequences.4            But, if we choose to depart\n\nfrom our previous position with respect to the charging language at\n\nissue here, we must do so as an en banc court.\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n3\n  Further, as we did in Holloway, Santos, and Mangos, we note that\nnothing in the record here suggests that any of Rivera's three\nconvictions were for the \"offensive\" type of assault and battery.\nSee Holloway, 499 F.3d at 118 n.5; Santos, 363 F.3d at 24; Mangos,\n134 F.3d at 464.\n4\n The classification of Rivera as an armed career criminal resulted\nin a statutory mandatory minimum of 180 months to 210 months. The\ndistrict court sentenced Rivera to 180 months' imprisonment to be\nfollowed by five years of supervised release.\n\n                                     -4-\n\f",
