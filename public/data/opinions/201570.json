Kuilan-Nevarez, appeals\n\nfrom a jury verdict in favor of appellee, the Department of\n\nVeterans Affairs, on her claim that appellee retaliated against her\n\nfor   filing   prior    complaints     of   disability        discrimination.\n\nAppellant's sole argument is that there was insufficient evidence\n\nto support the jury verdict.\n\n          Appellant's appeal founders due to appellant's failure to\n\nfile a motion for judgment as a matter of law or a motion for a new\n\ntrial.    It   is   well-settled     that   in   order   to    challenge   the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence on appeal a party must first have\n\npresented the claim to the district court, either by moving for\n\njudgment as a matter of law before the case is submitted to the\n\njury and renewing that motion after the verdict, Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n50(a), (b), or by moving for a new trial pursuant to Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 59. See, e.g., Hammond v. T.J. Little & Co., 82 F.3d 1166, 1171\n\n(1st Cir. 1996).    In the absence of the filing of such motions, we\n\nretain only \"a modicum of residual discretion\" to inquire whether\n\nthe record reflects an absolute dearth of evidentiary support for\n\nthe jury's verdict.     Faigin v. Kelly, 184 F.3d 67, 76 (1st Cir.\n\n1999); La Amiga del Pueblo, Inc. v. Robles, 937 F.2d 689, 691 (1st\n\nCir. 1991).
