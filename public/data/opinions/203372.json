In this consolidated appeal, the\n\ngovernment       challenges      the       district   court's      conclusion   that\n\nrequiring DNA collection from non-violent felons who are sentenced\n\nto probation violates the Fourth Amendment.                        In light of our\n\ndecision in United States v. Weikert, 504 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2007),\n\nwhich was issued seven months after the district court's ruling,\n\nthat       conclusion   cannot    stand.          Although   the    district    court\n\ncorrectly       concluded   that       a    \"totality   of   the     circumstances\"\n\nbalancing test must be used to analyze the constitutionality of the\n\nDNA collection program, the court's application of that balancing\n\ntest is inconsistent with our analysis in Weikert. Accordingly, we\n\nreverse.\n\n                                             I.\n\n               Appellee James Stewart was sentenced to three years of\n\nprobation after pleading guilty to felony charges that he obtained\n\nmore than $30,000 in disability benefits to which he was not\n\nentitled, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 641.                    The district court\n\nimposed the standard terms of probation, including the requirement\n\nthat Stewart cooperate with the collection of a DNA sample, as\n\nmandated by the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 (the\n\n\"DNA Act\"),1 Pub. L. No. 106-546, 114 Stat. 2726 (2000), codified\n\n\n       1\n      The statute requires individuals who have been convicted of\n\"a qualifying federal offense\" and who are incarcerated or on\nparole, probation, or supervised release to provide federal law\nenforcement authorities with \"a tissue, fluid, or other bodily\nsample\" for purposes of extracting their DNA.        42 U.S.C. §\n\n                                            -2-\n\fas amended in relevant part at 18 U.S.C. § 3563 and 42 U.S.C. §§\n\n14132, 14135a, 14135e.      Stewart moved to modify the conditions of\n\nhis probation, arguing that the DNA Act requirement, as applied to\n\nhim, constituted an unconstitutional warrantless and suspicionless\n\nsearch.   The district court agreed and granted Stewart's motion.\n\n           Appellee Nathalie Soto was sentenced by the same district\n\ncourt judge to two years of probation after pleading guilty to\n\ncharges of counterfeiting in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 473.         At the\n\nsentencing hearing, which was held four days before the opinion in\n\nStewart was issued, the court announced sua sponte that it would\n\nnot require Soto to submit to DNA collection as a condition of her\n\nprobation in order to \"be consistent with [the court's] thinking on\n\nthe matter . . . in other cases.\"\n\n           In its written decision in Stewart, the district court\n\napplied the totality of the circumstances balancing test set forth\n\nby the Supreme Court in United States v. Knights, 534 U.S. 112,\n\n118-19 (2001), and Samson v. California, 547 U.S. 843, 848 (2006).\n\nUnder   this   framework,   \"[w]hether   a   search   is   reasonable   'is\n\ndetermined by assessing, on the one hand, the degree to which it\n\nintrudes upon an individual's privacy and, on the other, the degree\n\nto which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental\n\n\n\n14135a(a)(1)-(2), (c)(1). The term \"qualifying federal offense\"\nincludes, inter alia, any felony. 42 U.S.C. § 14135a(d). Courts\nare required to order compliance with the DNA Act \"as an explicit\ncondition of a sentence of probation.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3563(a).\n\n                                   -3-\n\finterests.'\" Samson, 547 U.S. at 848 (quoting Knights, 534 U.S. at\n\n118-19).\n\n            The district court first considered three governmental\n\ninterests    that   could    support    the     DNA   Act's     requirements:       1)\n\nsupervision    of   individuals        on     probation,       2)     prevention    of\n\nrecidivism    through    deterrence,          and   3)   the        development    and\n\nmaintenance of a DNA database to assist in the solving of past and\n\nprospective crimes. United States v. Stewart, 468 F. Supp. 2d 261,\n\n269-70 (D. Mass. 2007).        The court then discounted each of these\n\ninterests, concluding that 1) the programmatic collection of DNA\n\nhas little connection to the supervision of probationers, 2) the\n\ngovernment's interest in deterring crime through the DNA program\n\nwas speculative at best because Stewart's crimes were non-violent\n\nproperty crimes, and 3) the government's general interest in\n\nsolving    crimes   should   not   be    given      \"overmuch       weight\"   in   the\n\nanalysis.    Id. at 270-73.\n\n            On the other side of the balance, the court acknowledged\n\nthat Stewart, as a probationer, had diminished expectations of\n\nprivacy.     However, the court found that those expectations were\n\nmeaningfully greater than those of individuals who were sentenced\n\nto terms of imprisonment or supervised release.                 The court further\n\nfound that the blood draw \"implicate[d] the most grave privacy\n\nrights,\" id. at 277, and that the subsequent analysis of the\n\nresulting sample constituted an \"extensive invasion of privacy\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\finterests,\" id. at 278.            In reaching this conclusion, the court\n\ndeclined to consider the statutory limitations on the use of the\n\nDNA    information,     noting     that    the   use     of    information,    once\n\ncollected, often expands over time.2              Id. at 279-80.       Thus, the\n\ncourt concluded that the \"governmental interest in collecting this\n\ninformation fail[ed] to override\" Stewart's privacy interests and,\n\nhence, the DNA Act was unconstitutional as applied to Stewart.3\n\nId. at 282.\n\n              Seven months later in United States v. Weikert, 504 F.3d\n\nat 18, we upheld against Fourth Amendment challenge the collection\n\nof DNA samples from individuals on supervised release.                     In doing\n\nso, we recognized the validity of the governmental interests that\n\nwere       discounted   by   the    district     court    in    Stewart.       More\n\nspecifically, we concluded that the government has \"important\n\ninterests in monitoring and rehabilitating supervised releasees,\n\nsolving crimes, and exonerating innocent individuals\" through use\n\nof the CODIS database.        Id. at 14.\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      The DNA Act provides that \"[a] person who knowingly discloses\na sample or result . . . in any manner to any person not authorized\nto receive it, or obtains or uses, without authorization, such\nsample or result\" is subject to a fine of up to $250,000 or one\nyear in prison. 42 U.S.C. § 14135e(c); see Weikert, 504 F.3d at 13\n(holding that the statutory penalty for misuse mitigates the risk\nthat abuse will occur).\n       3\n      The district court did not issue a separate written opinion\nwith regard to Soto. It relied instead on the statement from the\nbench that compliance with the DNA Act would not be required.\n\n                                          -5-\n\f            On   the    other   side   of    the   balance,     we    found      that\n\n\"individuals on conditional release have a substantially diminished\n\nexpectation of privacy,\" and that, contrary to the district court's\n\nconclusions in Stewart, the blood draw required for the collection\n\nof DNA samples is \"neither a significant nor an unusual intrusion.\"\n\nId. at 11-12.     We also concluded that the risk of misuse of the DNA\n\ninformation stored in CODIS did not \"significantly increase\" the\n\nconditional      releasee's     privacy     interest    because      the   DNA    Act\n\nincludes significant criminal penalties for such abuse and because\n\nthe \"junk DNA\" that is collected currently poses little risk of\n\nabuse.    Id. at 12-13.       Thus, we concluded that:\n\n            [T]he government's important interests in\n            monitoring   and  rehabilitating   supervised\n            releasees, solving crimes, and exonerating\n            innocent   individuals   outweigh   Weikert's\n            privacy interests, given his status as a\n            supervised releasee, the relatively minimal\n            inconvenience occasioned by a blood draw, and\n            the coding of genetic information that, by\n            statute, may be used only for purposes of\n            identification.\n\nId. at 14.\n\n            Stewart and Soto seek to distinguish themselves from the\n\ndefendant in Weikert in two ways and urge us, in light of these\n\ndifferences, to engage in a new balancing.              First, they emphasize\n\nthe particular nature of the crimes for which they were sentenced.\n\nThey argue that because their crimes were non-violent, property-\n\nrelated   crimes,      the   collection     of   DNA   would   not    serve      as   a\n\ndeterrent to recidivism as applied to them. This argument rests on\n\n                                       -6-\n\fthe flawed assumption that DNA evidence is only useful for solving\n\n– and thereby for deterring – violent crimes.        See Banks v. United\n\nStates, 490 F.3d 1178, 1189-90 (10th Cir. 2007) (noting that \"DNA\n\ncan be extracted from hair, saliva, and numerous other parts of our\n\nbodies that even a non-violent criminal could leave behind on a\n\npiece of inculpatory evidence\"). Moreover, attention to the nature\n\nof an individual conditional releasee's crime would detract from\n\nwhat we considered, in Weikert, to be a virtue of the DNA Act: that\n\nit applies uniformly to all felons and therefore \"the importance of\n\nthe government's interests is not diluted by the possibility of\n\nselective enforcement or harassment.\"       504 F.3d at 14.\n\n          Second,   Stewart   and    Soto   note   that   they   have   been\n\nsentenced only to probation, whereas the defendant in Weikert was\n\non supervised release.4       They claim that probationers have a\n\ngreater expectation of privacy than supervised releasees, who have\n\nalready served a term of imprisonment for their offenses.               This\n\nargument is foreclosed by our analysis in Weikert, where we noted\n\nthat \"[p]robation, supervised release, and parole are all different\n\nforms of conditional release,\" id. at 7 n.4, and stated that\n\n\n\n     4\n      As we explained in Weikert, \"[p]robation is an alternative\nsanction to imprisonment in which a court permits a convicted\noffender to serve his or her sentence in the community subject to\ncertain conditions and supervision by a probation officer.\" 504\nF.3d at 7 n.4. (citing 18 U.S.C. §§ 3561, 3563).       Supervised\nrelease, on the other hand, \"is a period of community supervision\nimposed by the court to be completed after release from a jail or\nprison sentence.\" Id. (citing 18 U.S.C. § 3583(a)).\n\n                                    -7-\n\f\"courts    generally    have   not     distinguished    among       conditional\n\nreleasees for Fourth Amendment purposes,\" id. at 12.                  See also\n\nUnited States v. Zimmerman, 514 F.3d 851, 855 (9th Cir. 2007)\n\n(treating probationer's Fourth Amendment challenge to DNA Act as\n\nforeclosed by prior precedent addressing challenge by supervised\n\nreleasee); Banks, 490 F.3d at 1186-87 (making no distinction\n\nbetween privacy interests of supervised releasees and probationers\n\nin a case involving both).          We explicitly found the differences\n\nbetween probation and supervised release to be immaterial in\n\nWeikert. 504 F.3d at 12.        Stewart and Soto offer no compelling\n\nrationale for altering that conclusion here.           The district court's\n\nanalysis    in   Stewart   cannot    survive   the   balance   we    struck   in\n\nWeikert.\n\n                                      II.\n\n            Our opinion in Weikert was narrowly drawn.              See id. at\n\n14-16.     We noted that \"demonstrated misuse of the DNA samples, a\n\nchange in the government's collection procedures to include non-\n\njunk DNA, or the discovery of new uses for 'junk DNA,' would\n\nrequire a reevaluation of the reasonableness balance.\"5              Id. at 14.\n\n\n     5\n      Stewart and Soto argue briefly that \"a recent statement by\nthe FBI shows its intent to 're-architect the CODIS software for\nuse in the identification of missing persons.'\" They aver that\nthese plans to enhance the effectiveness of the CODIS database must\nbe considered \"in the analysis as a factor which strengthens [the\nappellees'] privacy interests in [their] DNA profiles.\" We decline\nto consider this \"recent statement\" because it was not contained in\nthe record below, and, thus, it is not properly before us. See\nUnited States v. Chaklader, 987 F.2d 75, 75 n.1 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n                                      -8-\n\fWe   also   reserved   judgment   \"on    the   constitutionality   of   the\n\nretention and searching by the government of the DNA profiles of\n\nindividuals who have completed their terms of conditional release.\"\n\nId. at 15.    However, Stewart and Soto, as conditional releasees,\n\nfall squarely within the analysis in Weikert.           As such, Weikert\n\ngoverns the disposition of the present appeal and mandates reversal\n\nof the district court's orders in these two cases.\n\n            So ordered.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, such evidence might be important in a future case\ninvolving a challenge to the balance struck in Weikert on some of\nthe grounds noted in Weikert itself.\n\n                                   -9-\n\f",

In light of our decision in <i>United States v. Weikert,</i> 504 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.2007), which was issued seven months after the district court's ruling, that conclusion cannot stand. Although the district court correctly concluded that a \"totality of the circumstances\" balancing test must be used to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*34</span> analyze the constitutionality of the DNA collection program, the court's application of that balancing test is inconsistent with our analysis in <i>Weikert.</i> Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Appellee James Stewart was sentenced to three years of probation after pleading guilty to felony charges that he obtained more than $30,000 in disability benefits to which he was not entitled, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 641. The district court imposed the standard terms of probation, including the requirement that Stewart cooperate with the collection of a DNA sample, as mandated by the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 (the \"DNA Act\"),<sup>[1]</sup> Pub.L. No. 106-546, 114 Stat. 2726 (2000), <i>codified as amended in relevant part at</i> 18 U.S.C. § 3563 and 42 U.S.C. §§ 14132, 14135a, 14135e. Stewart moved to modify the conditions of his probation, arguing that the DNA Act requirement, as applied to him, constituted an unconstitutional warrantless and suspicionless search. The district court agreed and granted Stewart's motion.</p>\n<p>Appellee Nathalie Soto was sentenced by the same district court judge to two years of probation after pleading guilty to charges of counterfeiting in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 473. At the sentencing hearing, which was held four days before the opinion in <i>Stewart</i> was issued, the court announced sua sponte that it would not require Soto to submit to DNA collection as a condition of her probation in order to \"be consistent with [the court's] thinking on the matter . . . in other cases.\"</p>\n<p>In its written decision in <i>Stewart,</i> the district court applied the totality of the circumstances balancing test set forth by the Supreme Court in <i>United States v. Knights,</i> 534 U.S. 112, 118-19, 122 S.Ct. 587, 151 L.Ed.2d 497 (2001), and <i>Samson v. California,</i> 547 U.S. 843, 848, 126 S.Ct. 2193, 165 L.Ed.2d 250 (2006). Under this framework, \"[w]hether a search is reasonable `is determined by assessing, on the one hand, the degree to which it intrudes upon an individual's privacy and, on the other, the degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental interests.'\" <i>Samson,</i> 547 U.S. at 848, 126 S.Ct. 2193 (quoting <i>Knights,</i> 534 U.S. at 118-19, 122 S.Ct. 587).</p>\n<p>The district court first considered three governmental interests that could support the DNA Act's requirements: 1) supervision of individuals on probation, 2) prevention of recidivism through deterrence, and 3) the development and maintenance of a DNA database to assist in the solving of past and prospective crimes. <i>United States v. Stewart,</i> 468 F.Supp.2d 261, 269-70 (D.Mass.2007). The court then discounted each of these interests, concluding that 1) the programmatic collection of DNA has little connection to the supervision of probationers, 2) the government's interest in deterring crime through the DNA program was speculative at best because Stewart's crimes were non-violent property crimes, and 3) the government's general interest in solving crimes should not be given \"overmuch weight\" in the analysis. <i>Id.</i> at 270-73.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*35</span> On the other side of the balance, the court acknowledged that Stewart, as a probationer, had diminished expectations of privacy.

We also concluded that the risk of misuse of the DNA information stored in CODIS did not \"significantly increase\" the conditional releasee's privacy interest because the DNA Act includes significant criminal penalties for such abuse and because the \"junk DNA\" that is collected currently poses little risk of abuse. <i>Id.</i> at 12-13. Thus, we concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote>[T]he government's important interests in monitoring and rehabilitating supervised releasees, solving crimes, and exonerating innocent individuals outweigh Weikert's privacy interests, given his status as a supervised releasee, the relatively minimal inconvenience occasioned by a blood draw, and the coding of genetic information that, by statute, may be used only for purposes of identification.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 14.</p>\n<p>Stewart and Soto seek to distinguish themselves from the defendant in <i>Weikert</i> in two ways and urge us, in light of these differences, to engage in a new balancing. First, they emphasize the particular nature of the crimes for which they were sentenced. They argue that because their crimes were non-violent, property-related crimes, the collection of DNA would not serve as a deterrent to recidivism as applied <span class=\"star-pagination\">*36</span> to them. This argument rests on the flawed assumption that DNA evidence is only useful for solving  and thereby for deterring  violent crimes. <i>See </i><i>Banks v. United States,</i> 490 F.3d 1178, 1189-90 (10th Cir.2007) (noting that \"DNA can be extracted from hair, saliva, and numerous other parts of our bodies that even a non-violent criminal could leave behind on a piece of inculpatory evidence\"). Moreover, attention to the nature of an individual conditional releasee's crime would detract from what we considered, in <i>Weikert,</i> to be a virtue of the DNA Act: that it applies uniformly to all felons and therefore \"the importance of the government's interests is not diluted by the possibility of selective enforcement or harassment.\" 504 F.3d at 14.</p>\n<p>Second, Stewart and Soto note that they have been sentenced only to probation, whereas the defendant in <i>Weikert</i> was on supervised release.<sup>[4]</sup> They claim that probationers have a greater expectation of privacy than supervised releasees, who have already served a term of imprisonment for their offenses. This argument is foreclosed by our analysis in <i>Weikert,</i> where we noted that \"[p]robation, supervised release, and parole are all different forms of conditional release,\" <i>id.</i> at 7 n. 4, and stated that \"courts generally have not distinguished among conditional releasees for Fourth Amendment purposes,\" <i>id.</i> at 12. <i>See also </i><i>United States v. Zimmerman,</i> 514 F.3d 851, 855 (9th Cir.2007) (treating probationer's Fourth Amendment challenge to DNA Act as foreclosed by prior precedent addressing challenge by supervised releasee); <i>Banks,</i> 490 F.3d at 1186-87 (making no distinction between privacy interests of supervised releasees and probationers in a case involving both). We explicitly found the differences between probation and supervised release to be immaterial in <i>Weikert,</i> 504 F.3d at 12. Stewart and Soto offer no compelling rationale for altering that conclusion here. The district court's analysis in <i>Stewart</i> cannot survive the balance we struck in <i>Weikert.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Our opinion in <i>Weikert</i> was narrowly drawn. <i>See id.</i> at 14-16. We noted that \"demonstrated misuse of the DNA samples, a change in the government's collection procedures to include non-junk DNA, or the discovery of new uses for `junk DNA,' would require a reevaluation of the reasonableness balance.\"<sup>[5]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 14. We also reserved judgment \"on the constitutionality of the retention and searching by the government of the DNA profiles of individuals who have completed their terms of conditional release.\" <i>Id.</i> at 15. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*37</span> However, Stewart and Soto, as conditional releasees, fall squarely within the analysis in <i>Weikert.</i> As such, <i>Weikert</i> governs the disposition of the present appeal and mandates reversal of the district court's orders in these two cases.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Seventh Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The statute requires individuals who have been convicted of \"a qualifying federal offense\" and who are incarcerated or on parole, probation, or supervised release to provide federal law enforcement authorities with \"a tissue, fluid, or other bodily sample\" for purposes of extracting their DNA. 42 U.S.C. § 14135a(a)(1)-(2), (c)(1). The term \"qualifying federal offense\" includes, inter alia, any felony. 42 U.S.C. § 14135a(d). Courts are required to order compliance with the DNA Act \"as an explicit condition of a sentence of probation.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3563(a).</p>\n<p>[2]  The DNA Act provides that \"[a] person who knowingly discloses a sample or result . . . in any manner to any person not authorized to receive it, or obtains or uses, without authorization, such sample or result\" is subject to a fine of up to $250,000 or one year in prison. 42 U.S.C. § 14135e(c); <i>see </i><i>Weikert,</i> 504 F.3d at 13 (holding that the statutory penalty for misuse mitigates the risk that abuse will occur).</p>\n<p>[3]  The district court did not issue a separate written opinion with regard to Soto. It relied instead on the statement from the bench that compliance with the DNA Act would not be required.</p>\n<p>[4]  As we explained in <i>Weikert,</i> \"[p]robation is an <i>alternative</i> sanction to imprisonment in which a court permits a convicted offender to serve his or her sentence in the community subject to certain conditions and supervision by a probation officer.\" 504 F.3d at 7 n. 4. (citing 18 U.S.C. §§ 3561, 3563). Supervised release, on the other hand, \"is a period of community supervision imposed by the court to be completed <i>after</i> release from a jail or prison sentence.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing 18 U.S.C. § 3583(a)).</p>\n<p>[5]  Stewart and Soto argue briefly that \"a recent statement by the FBI shows its intent to 're-architect the CODIS software for use in the identification of missing persons.'\" They aver that these plans to enhance the effectiveness of the CODIS database must be considered \"in the analysis as a factor which strengthens [the appellees'] privacy interests in [their] DNA profiles.\" We decline to consider this \"recent statement\" because it was not contained in the record below, and, thus, it is not properly before us. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Chaklader,</i> 987 F.2d 75, 75 n. 1 (1st Cir. 1993).

In light of our decision in <i>United States v. Weikert,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202888\"><a href=\"/opinion/202888/united-states-v-weikert/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2007), which was issued seven months after the district court's ruling, that conclusion cannot stand. Although the district court correctly concluded that a \"totality of the circumstances\" balancing test must be used to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*34</span> analyze the constitutionality of the DNA collection program, the court's application of that balancing test is inconsistent with our analysis in <i>Weikert.</i> Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Appellee James Stewart was sentenced to three years of probation after pleading guilty to felony charges that he obtained more than $30,000 in disability benefits to which he was not entitled, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 641. The district court imposed the standard terms of probation, including the requirement that Stewart cooperate with the collection of a DNA sample, as mandated by the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 (the \"DNA Act\"),<sup>[1]</sup> Pub.L. No. 106-546, 114 Stat. 2726 (2000), <i>codified as amended in relevant part at</i> 18 U.S.C. § 3563 and 42 U.S.C. §§ 14132, 14135a, 14135e. Stewart moved to modify the conditions of his probation, arguing that the DNA Act requirement, as applied to him, constituted an unconstitutional warrantless and suspicionless search. The district court agreed and granted Stewart's motion.</p>\n<p>Appellee Nathalie Soto was sentenced by the same district court judge to two years of probation after pleading guilty to charges of counterfeiting in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 473. At the sentencing hearing, which was held four days before the opinion in <i>Stewart</i> was issued, the court announced sua sponte that it would not require Soto to submit to DNA collection as a condition of her probation in order to \"be consistent with [the court's] thinking on the matter . . . in other cases.\"</p>\n<p>In its written decision in <i>Stewart,</i> the district court applied the totality of the circumstances balancing test set forth by the Supreme Court in <i>United States v. Knights,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118468\"><a href=\"/opinion/118468/united-states-v-knights/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">112</span></a></span>, 118-19, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118468\"><a href=\"/opinion/118468/united-states-v-knights/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Under this framework, \"[w]hether a search is reasonable `is determined by assessing, on the one hand, the degree to which it intrudes upon an individual's privacy and, on the other, the degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental interests.'\" <i>Samson,</i> 547 U.S. at 848, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145640\"><a href=\"/opinion/145640/samson-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">587</span></a></span>).</p>\n<p>The district court first considered three governmental interests that could support the DNA Act's requirements: 1) supervision of individuals on probation, 2) prevention of recidivism through deterrence, and 3) the development and maintenance of a DNA database to assist in the solving of past and prospective crimes. <i>United States v. Stewart,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2531232\"><a href=\"/opinion/2531232/united-states-v-stewart/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">261</span></a></span>, 269-70 (D.Mass.2007). The court then discounted each of these interests, concluding that 1) the programmatic collection of DNA has little connection to the supervision of probationers, 2) the government's interest in deterring crime through the DNA program was speculative at best because Stewart's crimes were non-violent property crimes, and 3) the government's general interest in solving crimes should not be given \"overmuch weight\" in the analysis. <i>Id.</i> at 270-73.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*35</span> On the other side of the balance, the court acknowledged that Stewart, as a probationer, had diminished expectations of privacy. However, the court found that those expectations were meaningfully greater than those of individuals who were sentenced to terms of imprisonment or supervised release. The court further found that the blood draw \"implicate[d] the most grave privacy rights,\" <i>id.</i> at 277, and that the subsequent analysis of the resulting sample constituted an \"extensive invasion of privacy interests,\" <i>id.</i> at 278. In reaching this conclusion, the court declined to consider the statutory limitations on the use of the DNA information, noting that the use of information, once collected, often expands over time.<sup>[2]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 279-80. Thus, the court concluded that the \"governmental interest in collecting this information fail[ed] to override\" Stewart's privacy interests and, hence, the DNA Act was unconstitutional as applied to Stewart.<sup>[3]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 282.</p>\n<p>Seven months later in <i>United States v. Weikert,</i> 504 F.3d at 18, we upheld against Fourth Amendment challenge the collection of DNA samples from individuals on supervised release. In doing so, we recognized the validity of the governmental interests that were discounted by the district court in <i>Stewart.</i> More specifically, we concluded that the government has \"important interests in monitoring and rehabilitating supervised releasees, solving crimes, and exonerating innocent individuals\" through use of the CODIS database. <i>Id.</i> at 14.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the balance, we found that \"individuals on conditional release have a substantially diminished expectation of privacy,\" and that, contrary to the district court's conclusions in <i>Stewart,</i> the blood draw required for the collection of DNA samples is \"neither a significant nor an unusual intrusion.\" <i>Id.</i> at 11-12. We also concluded that the risk of misuse of the DNA information stored in CODIS did not \"significantly increase\" the conditional releasee's privacy interest because the DNA Act includes significant criminal penalties for such abuse and because the \"junk DNA\" that is collected currently poses little risk of abuse. <i>Id.</i> at 12-13.
