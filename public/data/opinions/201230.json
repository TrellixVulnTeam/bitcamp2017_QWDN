R. Champagne and Norman,\nHanson & Detroy, LLC were on brief, for petitioner.\n     Marcia J. Cleveland for respondents.\n\n\n                        August 30, 2004\n\f             LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.       Michael Preston filed a worker's\n\ncompensation claim against his employer, Bath Iron Works (BIW),\n\nalleging that harassment in the workplace aggravated the symptoms\n\nof his previously existing neurological condition.                      After the\n\nAdministrative Law Judge (ALJ) denied benefits, Preston appealed to\n\nthe Benefits Review Board (the Board).                 In vacating the ALJ's\n\ndecision, the Board ruled that the ALJ had not determined whether\n\nthe stress and harassment claimed by Preston had occurred, and it\n\nremanded for further consideration.             On remand, the ALJ made the\n\nrequisite findings on stress and harassment and reversed his\n\nearlier disposition by granting benefits to Preston.                BIW appealed\n\nthe ALJ's second decision, and the Board affirmed. BIW now appeals\n\nto   this    court,   arguing   primarily       that     the    Board   erred   in\n\noverturning the ALJ's first decision denying benefits.                    It also\n\nchallenges rulings in the Board's second decision.                After careful\n\nreview, we affirm.\n\n                                     I.\n\n             We derive the following facts from the record before the\n\nALJ. We relate only those facts necessary to dispose of the issues\n\non appeal.\n\n             Michael Preston suffers from a hereditary neurological\n\ndisorder called paramyoclonus multiplex, which causes involuntary\n\nshaking of his head and arms.      Preston has suffered symptoms of the\n\ndisease     from   approximately   age    ten    until    the    present.       The\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\finvoluntary shaking tends to become worse when he is under stress.\n\nWhen the stress subsides, however, his symptoms usually subside.\n\n            From 1978 until 1998, Preston worked at the BIW shipyard\n\nin Bath, Maine.   He began work as a \"rigger,\" which required him to\n\nattach shackles to ship components--which often weighed between 100\n\nand   150   tons--so   that   they   could   be   picked   up   by   a   crane.\n\nTypically, he worked as part of a six to eight person crew, and\n\nmost of his work was done on the ground or in a hydraulic lift\n\ncalled a \"cherry picker.\"       In the last six to eight years of his\n\ncareer, Preston spent about half of his time at work as a crane\n\noperator, maneuvering cranes that sat on tracks approximately forty\n\nfeet above the floor of the assembly area.\n\n            Preston alleges that, during his twenty years at BIW, he\n\nwas ridiculed, called derogatory names, and subjected to practical\n\njokes because of the symptoms of his disease.          Members of his crew\n\nreferred to him as \"Shake and Bake\" and would sometimes try to\n\nstartle him so that his shaking would become more pronounced. This\n\nharassment caused stress, which in turn exacerbated Preston's\n\nsymptoms.    As his shaking worsened, he began to worry that he could\n\nnot safely perform his job.          In a harmful cycle, this concern\n\ncaused even greater stress which further aggravated his symptoms.\n\nAs his symptoms grew worse, he claims that his coworkers began to\n\nquestion whether he was a danger to his crew.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f          In light of these difficulties at work, Preston began to\n\ntake time off to get his symptoms under control.         On the advice of\n\nhis treating physician, Dr. Stephanie Carcini, he stopped working\n\naltogether on August 28, 1998.       He reports that his symptoms have\n\nimproved since he stopped working.\n\n                                 II.\n\n          On October 22, 1998, Preston filed a claim for benefits\n\nunder the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (the Act),\n\n33 U.S.C. §§ 901-950.      On November 4, 1998, BIW controverted\n\nPreston's claim.   An ALJ held hearings on April 17 and April 19,\n\n2000, during which both parties presented evidence, including the\n\nexpert testimony of several physicians.         Preston argued that the\n\nworking conditions   at   BIW   so    aggravated   the   symptoms   of   his\n\ndisorder that he could not continue working.         BIW contended that\n\nany teasing or ridicule at the shipyard was minor and that any\n\ndeterioration in Preston's condition was due to other stressful\n\nevents in his life, such as struggles with his family life and his\n\nrecurring problems with alcohol abuse.\n\n          The evidence offered by BIW included the testimony of a\n\nneurologist, Dr. Seth Kolkin, and an evaluation conducted by a\n\npsychiatrist, Dr. David J. Bourne.         In his written decision, the\n\nALJ described Dr. Kolkin's testimony about whether stress could\n\naggravate Preston's conditions:\n\n          Dr. Kolkin . . . testified that stress can\n          worsen the involuntary movements associated\n\n                                     -4-\n\f           with myoclonus but only as a temporary\n           aggravation, that any improvement of that\n           temporary condition \"depends on the exact\n           situation and his levels of concentration,\n           medications, fatigue, motivation\" and that\n           [Preston] advised the doctor that he found his\n           work to be stressful \"because of depression\n           and difficulties at work.\"\n                  . . . [T]he doctor agree[d] [that]\n           \"[s]tress,     depression[,]    any    volition,\n           motivation, any degree of psychological state\"\n           would affect [Preston's] movements. . . .\n                   According to the doctor, stress and\n           fatigue     will    \"transiently\"     exacerbate\n           [Preston's] symptoms, that the exacerbation\n           would last for the \"duration of the fatigue or\n           stress\" and \"once that stress is resolved (the\n           person) would be back at (his) baseline,\" the\n           doctor remarking that it would take \"moments\"\n           to return to baseline after the stress is\n           removed and that [Preston] \"could work if he\n           had a calm, supportive environment,\" and \"that\n           if he were motivated and given some latitude\n           and encouragement and support, there is no\n           reason why he couldn't be doing what he was\n           doing before if he wanted to be.\" According\n           to the doctor, if [Preston] were to be called\n           derogatory names because of his myoclonus, he\n           should    report   those    instances   to   his\n           supervisors and if action were not taken to\n           stop that harassment, then such would not\n           constitute    a   calm   and   supporting   work\n           environment.\n\nDr.   Bourne's   evaluation,   dated    June   22,   2000,   assessed   only\n\nPreston's complaints of psychological problems, including anxiety\n\nand depression.    The ALJ quoted Dr. Bourne's evaluation at length\n\nin his opinion, including the following passage:\n\n           It is my [Dr. Bourne's] belief that Mr.\n           Preston's psychological condition has been\n           caused by his physical illness and by the\n           deterioration  of   his   health   which   he\n           perceives. His movement disorder has caused a\n           psychological struggle, which has left him\n\n                                  -5-\n\f            feeling isolated, sensitive and hurt.     I do\n            not have the expertise to determine whether\n            any eventual aggravation of the movement\n            disorder is or was due to work conditions, and\n            will defer to the expertise of neurologists\n            concerning that issue.\n\nThus, Dr. Kolkin stated that stressful working conditions could\n\naggravate Preston's physical symptoms, even if the aggravation\n\nlasted only as long as the stress remained.               Dr. Bourne explicitly\n\nlimited his analysis to Preston's psychological, rather than his\n\nphysical,    problems,    and     avoided   any    opinion     on   whether    work\n\nconditions aggravated Preston's movement disorder.\n\n            On January 2, 2001, the ALJ denied benefits to Preston.\n\nIn   his   written   order   he    explained      that,   to   be   eligible   for\n\nbenefits, a claimant must first establish a prima facie case, which\n\ngives rise to a presumption that his injury was caused by his\n\nemployment and thus is covered by the Act.\n\n            To   establish  a   prima  facie claim    for\n            compensation,    a    claimant    need    not\n            affirmatively establish a connection between\n            work and harm.    Rather, a claimant has the\n            burden of establishing only that (1) the\n            claimant sustained physical harm or pain and\n            (2) an accident occurred in the course of\n            employment, or conditions existed at work,\n            which could have caused the harm or pain.\n\n(citations    omitted).         The   ALJ   noted    that      \"[i]f   claimant's\n\nemployment aggravates a non-work-related, underlying disease so as\n\nto produce incapacitating symptoms, the resulting disability is\n\ncompensable.\" He also described the effect of establishing a prima\n\nfacie case:\n\n                                      -6-\n\f             Once this prima facie case is established, a\n             presumption is created under Section 20(a) [33\n             U.S.C. § 920(a)]1 that the employee's injury or\n             death arose out of employment. To rebut that\n             presumption, the party opposing entitlement\n             must present substantial evidence proving the\n             absence of or severing the connection between\n             such   harm   and    employment    or   working\n             conditions. . . . If the presumption is\n             rebutted, it no longer controls and the record\n             as a whole must be evaluated to determine the\n             issue of causation.\n\n             Despite laying out this analytical framework accurately,\n\nthe ALJ did not make specific findings as to whether Preston had\n\nsuffered     the   ridicule   and   verbal   abuse   at    work   that   he    had\n\ndescribed, or whether the alleged abuse had aggravated the symptoms\n\nof his disease.       Instead, the ALJ ruled that BIW had adequately\n\nrebutted any Section 20(a) presumption of causation through Dr.\n\nKolkin's testimony and Dr. Bourne's evaluation.               He analyzed the\n\nrebuttal of the Section 20(a) presumption in two passages.                In the\n\nfirst, he acknowledged the nature of Preston's claim and then\n\ndispatched it summarily:\n\n             In the case sub judice, Claimant alleges that\n             the harm to his bodily frame . . . resulted\n             from working conditions at the Employer's\n             shipyard.     The Employer has introduced\n             substantial evidence severing the connection\n\n\n     1\n         33 U.S.C. § 920 provides in relevant part:\n\nIn any proceeding for the enforcement of a claim for compensation\nunder this Act it shall be presumed, in the absence of substantial\nevidence to the contrary--\n\n     (a) that      the   claim   comes   within   the     provisions     of   this\n     chapter.\n\n                                      -7-\n\f            between such harm and Claimant's maritime\n            employment. Thus, the presumption falls out\n            of the case, does not control the result and I\n            shall now weigh and evaluate all of the record\n            evidence.\n\nLater in the opinion, he revisited BIW's attempt to rebut the\n\nSection 20(a) presumption:\n\n            [T]he Employer, in this case, has clearly\n            introduced substantial evidence to rebut the\n            presumption with the testimony of Dr. Kolkin,\n            both in his report and in his deposition, and\n            with the testimony of Dr. Bourne. Dr. Kolkin\n            testified that Claimant's condition is the\n            same now as it was six or ten years ago and\n            has not been aggravated or accelerated by his\n            work as a rigger, or by any of the alleged\n            stress in any way in the work environment.\n            Dr. Bourne has testified that Claimant's\n            psychological    condition   is    a   chronic\n            adjustment disorder which is caused by his\n            underlying pre-existing disease and which was\n            not   caused,   accelerated,   aggravated   or\n            exacerbated by the alleged stress at work.\n\nThe   ALJ   cited   only   Dr.   Kolkin's   testimony   and   Dr.   Bourne's\n\nevaluation in determining that BIW had rebutted the Section 20(a)\n\npresumption of causation with substantial evidence.\n\n            Preston appealed the ALJ's decision to the Board. In its\n\nwritten opinion of January 22, 2002, the Board noted that the ALJ\n\nhad not made specific findings on whether Preston had actually\n\nsuffered increased harassment and stress while working at BIW:\n\n            While the administrative law judge identified\n            claimant's allegations as to \"harm\" and\n            \"working conditions,\" he did not determine\n            whether the alleged stress and harassment at\n            claimant's   workplace  occurred.     Without\n            findings evaluating the conflicting evidence\n            on this issue the Board lacks the proper\n\n                                     -8-\n\f          context for considering whether employer\n          presented substantial evidence in rebuttal.\n\nThe Board reasoned that it should remand the case to the ALJ with\n\ninstructions to determine \"whether [Preston's] condition or its\n\nsymptoms were aggravated by conditions or an accident at work.\n\nAnswering this question requires findings identifying the accident\n\nor working conditions in existence which could have aggravated\n\n[Preston's] condition.\"\n\n          Additionally, the Board instructed the ALJ that Dr.\n\nKolkin's testimony and Dr. Bourne's evaluation were, as a matter of\n\nlaw, inadequate to rebut the Section 20(a) presumption of causation\n\nif the ALJ found on remand that Preston had established a prima\n\nfacie case.   The Board explained:\n\n          [T]he opinion of Dr. Kolkin actually supports\n          a causal connection rather than rebutting it\n          as the administrative law judge found. . . .\n          Dr. Kolkin testified that stress could\n          temporarily worsen the symptoms of claimant's\n          myoclonus disease.   He also stated that the\n          increase of the involuntary movements would\n          not be permanent but, rather, would dissipate\n          when the stressor was removed. . . . This\n          medical evidence supports the conclusion that\n          stressful   working  conditions   could  have\n          aggravated claimant's condition.\n\nIn a footnote, the Board explained that Dr. Bourne's evaluation was\n\nalso insufficient to rebut the Section 20(a) presumption: \"Dr.\n\nBourne's report addressed only the alleged psychiatric injury and\n\nnot the physical injury. In fact, Dr. Bourne specifically admitted\n\n\n\n\n                               -9-\n\fhe has no expertise to determine whether claimant's physical\n\ndisorder had been aggravated by his employment.\"\n\n            On remand, the ALJ stated that, \"having been directed by\n\nthe Board to reconsider the totality of this closed record on the\n\nnature and extent of the Section 20(a) presumption, [I am] now\n\nconstrained to find and conclude that [Preston] has established a\n\nprima facie claim.\"     His opinion contained a detailed analysis of\n\nthe evidence supporting the conclusion that the work environment at\n\nBIW   had   caused   stress   that   aggravated   Preston's   involuntary\n\nshaking.    Specifically, the ALJ relied on Preston's testimony, and\n\nthe testimony of Preston's supervisor, in finding that Preston had\n\nbeen ridiculed at work, that this ridicule caused stress, and that\n\nhis symptoms had at least worsened temporarily during stressful\n\nperiods during his twenty years at BIW.           Additionally, the ALJ\n\nrelied on testimony by BIW's own expert medical witnesses in\n\nfinding that workplace stress could exacerbate Preston's symptoms,\n\nif only temporarily, and thus that Preston had established that\n\nworkplace conditions could have aggravated the symptoms of his\n\nunderlying condition. The ALJ then found that BIW had not rebutted\n\nthe Section 20(a) presumption, noting correctly that the Board had\n\nruled as a matter of law that Dr. Kolkin's testimony and Dr.\n\nBourne's evaluation were not sufficient for rebuttal. Finally, the\n\nALJ ruled that Preston's claim was not time barred and that Preston\n\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fwas entitled to benefits based on his weekly wages and medical\n\nexpenses.\n\n            In making these findings and rulings, the ALJ groused\n\nthat he had been \"prompted by the Board.\"            Specifically, he stated\n\nthat \"after being prompted by the Board, I now find and conclude\n\nthat Mr. Preston has introduced ample evidence of harm to invoke\n\nthe [Section 20(a)] presumption.\"             He then added this complaint:\n\n            This matter is another example of cases\n            involving my decisions wherein the Board has\n            clearly   usurped   the   functions  of   this\n            Administrative    Law   Judge,   has   clearly\n            substituted its opinions for this trier-of-\n            fact who presided over two days of formal\n            hearings and who alone had the opportunity to\n            hear the testimony and judge the credibility\n            of witnesses testifying under oath before me.\n            In certain cases, the Board has treated the\n            Section 20(a) presumption as virtually an\n            irrebuttable presumption. This matter, in my\n            judgment, is another of those cases.\n\n            BIW appealed this second decision to the Board.                Taking\n\nsome cues from the complaints of the ALJ, it argued that the\n\nBoard's first decision \"exceeded the scope of its review and\n\nusurped the administrative law judge's function as a fact-finder\"\n\nbecause it \"reweighed the evidence and made inappropriate factual\n\ndeterminations       in   concluding   that     employer   did   not    establish\n\nrebuttal of the Section 20(a) presumption as a matter of law.\"                 It\n\nfurther argued that the Board had improperly \"required employer to\n\n'rule   out'   any    possible   causal       connection   between     claimant's\n\nemployment and his condition in order to establish rebuttal,\"\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\finstead of allowing BIW to rebut a Section 20(a) presumption with\n\nonly \"substantial evidence.\"\n\n           The Board rejected these arguments.                   It ruled that its\n\nfirst decision had only required the ALJ to undertake the Section\n\n20(a) analysis mandated by law, which required the ALJ to make\n\nspecific   findings       about    stress        and   harassment    in   Preston's\n\nworkplace.      With respect to its ruling that BIW had not introduced\n\nevidence sufficient to rebut a Section 20(a) presumption, the Board\n\nwrote that it had merely \"applied the well-established aggravation\n\nrule, which provides that where a claimant's employment aggravates,\n\naccelerates or combines with a pre-existing condition, the entire\n\nresulting disability is compensable.\"                  Under that rule, BIW could\n\nonly    rebut    a    Section     20(a)     presumption      of    causation     with\n\n\"substantial evidence that claimant's condition was not aggravated\n\nby his working conditions.\" The Board concluded that \"[a]s none of\n\nthe physicians opined to 'a reasonable degree of medical certainty'\n\nthat claimant's working conditions did not aggravate his underlying\n\nphysical condition, employer did not meet its burden of production\"\n\nto rebut the Section 20(a) presumption.                   The Board affirmed the\n\nALJ's   second       decision   because     BIW    had    \"not    challenge[d]    the\n\nadministrative law judge's findings invoking Section 20(a)\" and had\n\n\"not point[ed] to any evidence sufficient to rebut Section 20(a).\"\n\nFinally, the Board affirmed the ALJ's rulings on the timeliness of\n\nPreston's filing and the award of benefits.\n\n\n                                          -12-\n\f            On appeal to this court, BIW argues primarily that the\n\nBoard erred in overturning the ALJ's first decision.               It further\n\nargues that both the Board and the ALJ, in the second round of\n\ndecisions, erred in (1) finding that Preston filed his claim in a\n\ntimely fashion, (2) finding that Preston was \"disabled\" within the\n\nmeaning of the Act and was therefore entitled to benefits, (3)\n\ndetermining Preston's average weekly wage for the purpose of\n\ncalculating the award of benefits, and (4) considering the question\n\nof medical benefits even though the parties had agreed to litigate\n\nthat issue at a later date.        We take each of these arguments in\n\nturn.   \"This court reviews the [Board's] decision on legal issues\n\nde   novo   and    determines    whether    the    Board    adhered     to   the\n\n'substantial      evidence'   standard    when    it   reviewed   the   [ALJ's]\n\nfactual findings.\"      Bath Iron Works v. Brown, 194 F.3d 1, 3 (1st\n\nCir. 1999).\n\n                                   III.\n\nA. The Board's First Decision\n\n            \"In order for an injury to be covered by the Act, the\n\nclaimant must initially make out a prima facie case.               That is, a\n\nclaimant 'must at least allege an injury that arose in the course\n\nof employment as well as out of employment.'\"              Brown, 194 F.3d at\n\n4 (quoting U.S. Indus./Fed. Sheet Metal, Inc. v. Director, OWCP,\n\n455 U.S. 608, 615 (1982)).        To establish a prima facie case, a\n\nclaimant must make two showings: (1) that he \"sustained physical\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\fharm\" and (2) \"that conditions existed at work which could have\n\ncaused the harm.\"          Susoeff v. San Francisco Stevedoring Co., 19\n\nBen. Rev. Bd. Serv. 149, 151 (1986).             Thus, to make his prima facie\n\ncase, the claimant is not required to show a causal connection\n\nbetween the harm and his working conditions, but rather must show\n\nonly     that    the   harm    could    have   been    caused    by   his   working\n\nconditions.       For the purposes of making a claim under the Act, the\n\nphysical harm alleged can be the aggravation of a previously\n\nexisting condition.           See Gardner v. Director, OWCP, 640 F.2d 1385,\n\n1389 (1st Cir. 1981) (holding that aggravation of claimant's\n\nsymptoms        from   a   previously     existing      venous    condition     was\n\ncompensable under the Act); Strachan Shipping Co. v. Nash, 782 F.2d\n\n513, 517 (5th Cir. 1986) (\"[W]here an employment injury worsens or\n\ncombines with a preexisting impairment to produce a disability\n\ngreater than that which would have resulted from the employment\n\ninjury alone, the entire resulting disability is compensable.\").\n\n                Once a claimant makes a prima facie case, he is entitled\n\nto   a   presumption       that   the   injury   was   caused    by   his   working\n\nconditions and is therefore compensable under the Act.                  33 U.S.C.\n\n§ 920(a); see also Brown, 194 F.3d at 5 (\"Once [claimant] made out\n\nhis prima facie case, there was a presumption of liability.\").                   An\n\nemployer can rebut this so-called \"Section 20(a)\" presumption by\n\n\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\fdemonstrating, through substantial evidence,2 that the injury was\n\nnot caused by the claimant's working conditions.                     See Brown, 194\n\nF.3d at 5; Sprague v. Director, OWCP, 688 F.2d 862, 865 (1st Cir.\n\n1982). If an employer introduces substantial evidence severing the\n\ncausal   connection        between    the    injury    and       claimant's   working\n\nconditions, \"the presumption 'falls' out of the case.\"                        Sprague,\n\n688 F.2d at 866 n.7.          In that instance, the claimant bears the\n\nburden of showing, \"based on the record as a whole,\" that his\n\ninjury was caused by his working conditions.                 Brown, 194 F.3d at 5.\n\n            BIW contends that the Board erred in its first decision\n\nby   ruling   that     the    ALJ    had     not    made   sufficient       \"findings\n\nidentifying the accident or working conditions in existence which\n\ncould have aggravated [Preston's] condition.\"                    Rather, BIW argues\n\nthat the ALJ found in his first decision that Preston had suffered\n\nstress on     the    job   that     could    have   aggravated       his   condition,\n\ndetermined    that    Preston       had     established      a    prima    facie   case\n\nentitling him to the Section 20(a) presumption of causation, but\n\nthen ruled that BIW had rebutted that presumption with substantial\n\nevidence that personal factors unrelated to work caused claimant's\n\nstress and worsened his condition.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      \"Substantial evidence\" is \"such relevant evidence as a\nreasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\"\nSprague v. Director, OWCP, 688 F.2d 862, 865 (1st Cir. 1982)\n(citation and quotation marks omitted).\n\n                                          -15-\n\f           BIW points to a single statement from the ALJ's first\n\ndecision to     support   its    argument     that      he    made    the     necessary\n\nfindings   on   stress    and    harassment:       \"I     may      properly    rely   on\n\nClaimant's credible testimony to establish that he experienced a\n\nwork-related harm, if the record reflects the presence of working\n\nconditions that could have caused the harm, thereby invoking the\n\nSection 20(a) presumption.\"           This is a contingent finding -- \"if\n\nthe record reflects . . . .\"           The ALJ never stated whether \"the\n\nrecord reflects the presence of working conditions that could have\n\ncaused the harm.\"\n\n           In   contrast,       the   ALJ   made    explicit         findings       about\n\nPreston's work environment in his second decision.                     Specifically,\n\nhe found that Preston was \"routinely called 'Shake and Bake'\" and\n\nthat \"[t]his nickname was so pervasive that at least some employees\n\ndid not know [Preston] by his real name.\"                  He further found that\n\nPreston \"was subjected to ad hominum [sic] and dehumanizing remarks\n\nabout a genetic condition he could not do anything to change,\" that\n\n\"even though his job performance was good, he was subjected to\n\nconstant name calling and pranks,\" and that \"[s]urely, ridicule for\n\nan inherited condition would make the usual stress of a job worse\n\nfor anyone.\"      He concluded that Preston's \"stressful working\n\nconditions aggravated, accelerated and exacerbated his pre-existing\n\nand chronic     neurological      disorder.\"         In      the    absence    of   such\n\n\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\ffindings in the ALJ's first decision, the Board was entitled to\n\nremand the case to the ALJ.\n\n           BIW next argues that the Board's first decision ignored\n\nthe ALJ's findings that the evidence \"as a whole\" did not support\n\na causal connection between the aggravation of Preston's symptoms\n\nand his workplace conditions.             This argument, however, skips\n\nseveral steps in the proper analysis.         The ALJ could only consider\n\n\"the   record   as   a   whole\"   after   finding   that   (1)   Preston   had\n\nestablished a prima facie case and was therefore entitled to the\n\nSection 20(a) presumption, and (2) BIW had rebutted the Section\n\n20(a) presumption.        In reviewing the ALJ's first decision, the\n\nBoard never reached the ALJ's analysis of the \"record as a whole\"\n\nbecause it found that the ALJ had not made the factual findings\n\nabout Preston's workplace conditions necessary to determine whether\n\nPreston had established a prima facie case.                Thus, the ALJ's\n\nanalysis of whether the \"record as a whole\" supported a causal\n\nconnection between Preston's injury and his work environment was\n\nirrelevant to the question remanded by the Board in its first\n\ndecision: whether Preston's work environment had caused stress that\n\ncould have aggravated his condition.\n\n           BIW also argues that the Board usurped the ALJ's fact\n\nfinding authority in its first decision when it stated that Dr.\n\nKolkin's testimony and Dr. Bourne's evaluation were not sufficient\n\nto rebut the Section 20(a) presumption.             This conclusion of the\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fBoard, however, was a legal conclusion.          There was no disagreement\n\nbetween the ALJ and the Board about the substance of the testimony\n\nor its credibility.       Rather, the Board concluded that, \"as Dr.\n\nKolkin opined that stress could aggravate claimant's pre-existing\n\ncondition,\" his testimony could not, as a matter of law, sever the\n\ncausal link between Preston's aggravated symptoms and his work\n\nenvironment.    Thus, it could not rebut a Section 20(a) presumption\n\nthat Preston's injury was caused by his work environment.\n\n            Similarly,    the    Board     emphasized   that   Dr.   Bourne's\n\nevaluation only addressed Preston's mental state, and that Dr.\n\nBourne had specifically declined to comment on Preston's physical\n\nsymptoms.     It ruled that testimony about Preston's mental state\n\ncould not rebut a Section 20(a) presumption that Preston's physical\n\ninjury was caused by his workplace environment.                 The Board's\n\nconclusions    about     Dr.    Kolkin's    testimony   and    Dr.   Bourne's\n\nevaluation did not usurp the ALJ's authority to make findings of\n\nfact; rather they addressed only the legal sufficiency of that\n\nevidence to rebut the Section 20(a) presumption.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\fB. The Board's Second Decision3\n\n           1. Timely Notice\n\n           BIW argues that Preston did not file a claim within the\n\ntime period specified by the Act, and therefore his claim is\n\nbarred.   The Act imposes two separate time limits for filing a\n\nworkers' compensation claim.       In the case of a \"traumatic injury,\"\n\nan employee must give notice to his employer within thirty days of\n\nthe injury.      33 U.S.C. § 912(a).      In the case of an \"occupational\n\ninjury\"   that    does   not   immediately    result    in    disability,    the\n\nemployee must      notify   the   employer    within    one   year   after   the\n\nemployee becomes aware, or should have become aware, \"of the\n\nrelationship between the employment, the disease, and the . . .\n\ndisability.\"       Id.      However,    \"[f]ailure     to   give   such   notice\n\n[required by § 912(a)] shall not bar any claim under this chapter\n\n\n\n     3\n      In its reply brief, BIW argued for the first time that the\nALJ's second decision should be vacated because it was based on\nwhat BIW calls \"coerced findings of fact.\"      BIW says that the\ncritical issue is \"whether a decision can stand where a trier-of-\nfact expressly and unambiguously disagrees with the facts he was\nforced to find.\" BIW also tried to elaborate on this argument at\noral argument. Pursuant to well-established precedent, we decline\nto address this argument. \"[A]rguments raised in a reply brief are\ninsufficient to preserve a claim on appeal.\" Frazier v. Bailey,\n957 F.2d 920, 932 n.14 (1st Cir. 1992). However, to dispel any\nnotion of unfairness to BIW, we make three points: (1) The Board\ndid not order the ALJ to find that Preston had experienced stress\nand harassment in the workplace. It simply ordered him to find\nwhether they had occurred. (2) To the extent that the ALJ read the\nBoard's decision as requiring him to find in favor of Preston, he\nmisread the Board's decision.    (3) Most importantly, there was\nsubstantial evidence in the record to support the ALJ's findings in\nfavor of Preston.\n\n                                       -19-\n\f(1) if the employer . . . or the carrier had knowledge of the\n\ninjury.\"   33 U.S.C. § 912(d).\n\n           In his second decision, the ALJ ruled that BIW had actual\n\nknowledge of the aggravation of Preston's condition on September\n\n22, 1997, when Preston and his union representative met with the\n\nmedical staff of BIW at the shipyard infirmary.        Records from that\n\nmeeting    indicate   that   Preston   \"discuss[ed]   his    tremors   and\n\nindicat[ed] he is feeling uncomfortable due to coworker pressure\n\nand a worsening of his condition.\" Preston also indicated that his\n\ntremors were \"worse when under stress\" and that his \"coworkers are\n\nconcerned about their safety and often made fun of him.\"               This\n\nrecord constitutes substantial evidence that BIW was aware of\n\nPreston's injury as early as September 22, 1997.            Thus, the ALJ\n\nruled correctly that Preston's failure to formally notify BIW was\n\nexcused pursuant to § 912(d).\n\n            The ALJ also offered an alternative basis for finding\n\nthat Preston's claim was not barred, ruling that Preston did not\n\nknow until August 28, 1998, that his aggravated condition would\n\nprevent him from continuing his employment.           On that date, Dr.\n\nCarcini evaluated Preston and suggested that he should stop work\n\nimmediately.    Dr. Carcini also composed a letter on that date to\n\nthe referring physician stating that \"I do feel that he is having\n\na lot of movement problems that prohibit safe operation of a crane\n\nat work.   I would like to take him out of work immediately and make\n\n\n                                  -20-\n\fplans for disability or perhaps another type of job.\"    Since this\n\nrecommendation from Dr. Carcini was the first notice Preston\n\nreceived that he could not continue to work, the ALJ ruled that\n\nAugust 28, 1998, was the date from which the time period for\n\nnotifying his employer should be measured.     See Bechtel Assocs.,\n\nP.C., v. Sweeney, 834 F.2d 1029, 1033 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (\"[T]he\n\nlimitation period begins only when the employee knows or should\n\nknow that (1) his injury is causally related to his employment and\n\n(2) his injury is impairing his capacity to earn wages.\").      BIW\n\nreceived a copy of Dr. Carcini's letter, and therefore was aware\n\nshortly after August 28, 1998, that the aggravation of Preston's\n\ncondition was due to his work environment and prevented him from\n\nadequately performing his job.     Therefore, pursuant to § 912(d),\n\nPreston's claim could not be time barred because BIW had actual\n\nknowledge of Preston's injury shortly after August 28, 1998, the\n\ndate on which the limitations period began to run.\n\n          2. Entitlement to Benefits\n\n          BIW contends that Preston is not entitled to benefits\n\nbecause substantial evidence did not support the ALJ's finding in\n\nhis second decision that Preston was \"totally disabled\" within the\n\nmeaning of the Act.   BIW argues that the evidence before the ALJ\n\ndemonstrated that Preston's condition was aggravated by other\n\nfactors, including his family life and struggle with alcohol abuse,\n\nrather than by his working conditions.\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\f            The Act defines disability as \"incapacity because of\n\ninjury to earn the wages which the employee was receiving at the\n\ntime of injury in the same or any other employment.\"                  33 U.S.C. §\n\n902(10).     Thus, \"[t]o establish a prima facie case of total\n\ndisability, claimant must show that he is unable to return to his\n\nusual    employment\"     because   of    his   injury.4        Delay      v.   Jones\n\nWashington Stevedoring Co., 31 Ben. Rev. Bd. Serv. 197 (1998).\n\n\"Once a claimant demonstrates an inability to return to his job\n\nbecause of a work-related injury, he is considered totally disabled\n\nwithin the meaning of [the Act] and the burden shifts to the\n\nemployer    to   prove    the   availability         of   suitable    alternative\n\nemployment in the claimant's community.\"                  Palombo v. Director,\n\nOWCP, 937 F.2d 70, 71 (2d Cir. 1991).                In this case, BIW offered\n\nno evidence regarding the availability of alternative employment\n\nand thus relies only on the argument that Preston did not establish\n\na prima facie case of disability.\n\n            The ALJ concluded that the \"record leads inescapably to\n\nthe conclusion that claimant cannot return to work as a crane\n\noperator    at    the    employer's      shipyard.\"           In     making     this\n\ndetermination,    the    ALJ    relied   on    the    testimony      of   Preston's\n\n\n     4\n      The establishment of a \"disability\" is distinct from the\nestablishment of an \"injury\" covered by the Act, which we discussed\nsupra Part III.A. See Bath Iron Works Corp. v. White, 584 F.2d\n569, 574 (1st Cir. 1978) (\"To establish the right to disability\nbenefits, an employee must show, aided in certain contexts by the\n[Section 20(a)] presumption, that he has suffered a disabling\noccupational injury. . . . It must further be established that the\ninjury has produced a 'disability' . . . .\").\n                               -22-\n\fsupervisor, who stated that Preston was subjected to name calling\n\nand practical jokes, and that his tremors had become so pronounced\n\nthat other members of his crew questioned whether Preston could\n\nsafely perform his work.            The ALJ also relied on Dr. Kolkin's\n\ntestimony      that    Preston    needed    a   \"calm   and    supporting    work\n\nenvironment,\" and noted that the teasing and ridicule that Preston\n\nsuffered, combined with normal stresses associated with working in\n\na   shipyard    setting,    did    not   constitute     such   an   environment.\n\nFinally, he relied on the opinions of Dr. Carcini and Dr. David G.\n\nStandaert, another of Preston's treating physicians, that Preston's\n\naggravated symptoms prevented him from safely performing the tasks\n\nrequired by      his    employment.        He   concluded   that    \"the   medical\n\nevidence establishes that all of the doctors who have expressed an\n\nopinion on [Preston's] ability to operate a crane are in agreement\n\nthat he cannot safely do so.\"\n\n            This testimony by Preston's supervisor and by several\n\nmedical experts, along with Preston's own contentions, constitute\n\nsubstantial evidence that Preston cannot perform his usual work at\n\nthe BIW shipyard.       Thus, the ALJ was entitled to find that Preston\n\nwas totally disabled within the meaning of the Act and was entitled\n\nto benefits.\n\n            3. Calculation of Preston's Average Weekly Wage\n\n            The amount of a disabled employee's award of benefits\n\nunder the Act depends on the average weekly wage that the employee\n\nearned while employed.           See 33 U.S.C. § 908 (stating formulas for\n                                        -23-\n\fcalculating disability benefits based on an employee's average\n\nweekly wage).   Pursuant to 33 U.S.C. § 910, an ALJ can calculate an\n\nemployee's average weekly wage in several ways.             If a claimant was\n\nemployed for substantially the whole year prior to the injury, §\n\n910(a)    instructs   that   the   average    annual   earnings    should   be\n\ncalculated by determining the average daily wage during the period\n\nworked, and multiplying that number by either 260, if the employee\n\nwas a five-day worker, or 300, if the employee was a six-day\n\nworker.     That annual figure is then divided by fifty-two to\n\ndetermine the average weekly wage.           § 910(d)(1).    If, however, an\n\nemployee has not worked substantially all of the previous year, §\n\n910(b) provides that the average weekly wage should be determined\n\nby looking at the wages earned by employees of the same class, in\n\nthe same or similar employment, and in the same or a neighboring\n\nlocation.     Where neither § 910(a) or § 910(b) can be properly\n\napplied, § 910(c) requires that the average annual wage used to\n\ncalculate the average weekly wage \"shall reasonably represent the\n\nannual earning capacity of the injured employee.\"             Section 910(c)\n\ndoes not provide a precise method for determining an employee's\n\nannual earning capacity, but it does state that the ALJ should\n\nconsider the previous earnings of the employee as well as the\n\nearnings of similarly situated employees.\n\n            In this case, the record included wage information only\n\nfor the final thirty-nine weeks of the fifty-two weeks preceding\n\nthe filing of Preston's complaint, and it showed no earnings for\n                                    -24-\n\feight of those thirty-nine weeks.              Moreover, the record did not\n\nindicate whether Preston had been a six-day per week or five-day\n\nper week worker.        The ALJ reasoned that this partial record was not\n\nsufficient to determine Preston's average weekly wage under §\n\n910(a).    The ALJ also ruled that the \"paucity of evidence as to the\n\nwages     earned   by    a     comparable   employee\"    prevented   him    from\n\ndetermining Preston's average weekly wage pursuant to § 910(b).\n\nFinding that neither § 910(a) nor § 910(b) could be \"reasonably and\n\nfairly    applied,\"      the    ALJ   calculated   the   average   weekly   wage\n\npursuant to § 910(c).          See Story v. Navy Exch. Serv. Ctr., 30 Ben.\n\nRev. Bd. Serv. 225 (1997) (holding that § 910(c) is a catch-all\n\nprovision to be applied when neither § 910(a) nor § 910(b) can be\n\nreasonably and fairly applied).\n\n            The ALJ calculated Preston's average weekly wage by\n\ntaking the wages that Preston earned during the thirty-nine weeks\n\naccounted for in the wage report ($20,456.35), and dividing that\n\namount by thirty-one weeks (thirty-nine weeks minus the eight weeks\n\nfor which the wage report indicated no earnings). This calculation\n\nled the ALJ to find that Preston's average weekly wage was $659.88.\n\nBIW argues that the ALJ should have calculated the average weekly\n\nwage pursuant to § 910(a) by dividing Preston's earnings during the\n\nprevious thirty-nine week period by thirty-nine, thereby including\n\nin the calculation the eight weeks in which, according to the wage\n\nreport, Preston performed no work.             BIW's suggested method would\n\nhave resulted in an average weekly wage of $524.50.\n                                        -25-\n\f          \"The   essential   purpose   of   the   average   weekly   wage\n\ndetermination is to reflect 'a claimant's annual earning capacity\n\nat the time of the injury.'\"      Hall v. Consol. Employment Sys.,\n\nInc., 139 F.3d 1025, 1031 (5th Cir. 1998) (citation omitted)\n\n(emphasis in original). The ALJ's determination in this respect is\n\nsubject to the \"substantial evidence\" standard.        Id. at 1031-32.\n\nIn this case, the record contained only partial information about\n\nPreston's work history over the previous year, with no indication\n\nof whether he worked five days or six days per week.        Since these\n\nfactors are critical to the calculation of an average weekly wage\n\nunder § 910(a), the ALJ was entitled to find that § 910(a) could\n\nnot be \"reasonably and fairly applied.\"      Moreover, in calculating\n\nPreston's average weekly wage under § 910(c), the ALJ accounted for\n\nthe fact that Preston's condition, aggravated or otherwise, might\n\nlimit his ability to consistently perform a full work week.           The\n\nthirty-one weeks used in the ALJ's calculation included a wide\n\nrange of hours worked, from 4.5 to 51.8, and thus presumably\n\nincluded weeks in which Preston took time off because of his\n\naggravated condition.   If anything, the ALJ's calculation likely\n\nunderestimated the amount that Preston could have earned if he had\n\nnot been dealing with aggravated symptoms caused by his work\n\nenvironment.   Therefore, substantial evidence supported the ALJ's\n\ncalculation of Preston's average weekly wage pursuant to § 910(c).\n\n\n\n          4. Medical Benefits\n                                -26-\n\f             Finally, BIW argues that the ALJ erred in granting\n\nPreston medical benefits pursuant to 33 U.S.C. § 907 because the\n\nparties had agreed to litigate the propriety of medical benefits\n\nonly after litigating whether Preston's injuries were work related.\n\nThe Board vacated the portion of the ALJ's decision granting any\n\nspecific medical expenses, ruling that the parties could litigate\n\nor   reach   agreement   on   the   \"reasonable   necessity   of   medical\n\ntreatment\" at a future date.          However, it affirmed the ALJ's\n\ngeneral finding that Preston was entitled to medical benefits under\n\n§ 907.\n\n             We affirm the Board's decision on this issue.         Section\n\n907(a) provides that an \"employer shall furnish such medical . . .\n\ntreatment . . . as the nature of the injury . . . may require.\"\n\nThus, if a claimant is found to have suffered an \"injury\" as\n\ndefined under the Act, he is generally entitled to medical benefits\n\npursuant to § 907(a). See Ingalls Shipbuilding, Inc., v. Director,\n\nOWCP, 991 F.2d 163, 165 (5th Cir. 1993) (stating that § 907\n\n\"entitles a claimant to reasonable and necessary medical services\n\nif he suffers a work-related injury\").            Our holding does not,\n\nhowever, prevent the parties from further litigating the propriety\n\nor reasonableness of any specific medical expense.\n\n\n\n\n                                    IV.\n\n\n                                    -27-\n\f            For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the Board is\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n            SO ORDERED.\n\n\n\n\n                                -28-\n\f",

After the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) denied benefits, Preston appealed to the Benefits Review Board (the Board). In vacating the ALJ's decision, the Board ruled that the ALJ had not determined whether the stress and harassment claimed by Preston had occurred, and it remanded for further consideration. On remand, the ALJ made the requisite findings on stress and harassment and reversed his earlier disposition by granting benefits to Preston. BIW appealed the ALJ's second decision, and the Board affirmed. BIW now appeals to this court, arguing primarily that the Board erred in overturning the ALJ's first decision denying benefits. It also challenges rulings in the Board's second decision. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We derive the following facts from the record before the ALJ. We relate only those facts necessary to dispose of the issues on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Michael Preston suffers from a hereditary neurological disorder called paramyoclonus multiplex, which causes involuntary shaking of his head and arms. Preston has suffered symptoms of the disease from approximately age ten until the present. The involuntary shaking tends to become worse when he is under stress. When the stress subsides, however, his symptoms usually subside.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From 1978 until 1998, Preston worked at the BIW shipyard in Bath, Maine. He began work as a \"rigger,\" which required him to attach shackles to ship components &#8212; which often weighed between 100 and 150 tons &#8212; so that they could be picked up by a crane. Typically, he worked as part of a six to eight person crew, and most of his work was done on the ground or in a hydraulic lift called a \"cherry picker.\" In the last six to eight years of his career, Preston spent about half of his time at work as a crane operator, maneuvering cranes that sat on tracks approximately forty feet above the floor of the assembly area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Preston alleges that, during his twenty years at BIW, he was ridiculed, called derogatory names, and subjected to practical jokes because of the symptoms of his disease. Members of his crew referred to him as \"Shake and Bake\" and would sometimes try to startle him so that his shaking would become more pronounced. This harassment caused stress, which in turn exacerbated Preston's symptoms. As his shaking worsened, he began to worry that he could not safely perform his job. In a harmful cycle, this concern caused even greater stress which further aggravated his symptoms. As his symptoms grew worse, he claims that his coworkers began to question whether he was a danger to his crew.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of these difficulties at work, Preston began to take time off to get his symptoms under control. On the advice of his treating physician, Dr. Stephanie Carcini, he stopped working altogether on August 28, 1998. He reports that his symptoms have improved since he stopped working.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 22, 1998, Preston filed a claim for benefits under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (the Act), 33 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 901-950. On November 4, 1998, BIW controverted Preston's claim. An ALJ held hearings on April 17 and April 19, 2000, during which both parties presented evidence, including the expert testimony of several physicians. Preston argued that the working conditions at BIW so aggravated the symptoms of his disorder that he could not continue working. BIW contended that any teasing or ridicule at the shipyard was minor and that any deterioration in Preston's condition was due to other stressful events in his life, such as struggles with his family life and his recurring problems with alcohol abuse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence offered by BIW included the testimony of a neurologist, Dr. Seth Kolkin, and an evaluation conducted by a psychiatrist, Dr. David J. Bourne. In his written decision, the ALJ described Dr. Kolkin's testimony about whether stress could aggravate Preston's conditions:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Kolkin ... testified that stress can worsen the involuntary movements associated with myoclonus but only as a temporary aggravation, that any improvement of that temporary condition \"depends on the exact situation and his levels of concentration, medications, fatigue, motivation\" and that [Preston] advised the doctor that he found his work to be stressful \"because of depression and difficulties at work.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">... [T]he doctor agree[d] [that] \"[s]tress, depression[,] any volition, motivation, any degree of psychological state\" would affect [Preston's] movements....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the doctor, stress and fatigue will \"transiently\" exacerbate [Preston's] symptoms, that the exacerbation would last for the \"duration of the fatigue or stress\" and \"once that stress is resolved (the person) would be back at (his) baseline,\" the doctor remarking that it would take \"moments\" to return to baseline after the stress is removed and that [Preston] \"could work if he had a calm, supportive environment,\" and \"that if he were motivated and given some latitude and encouragement and support, there is no reason why he couldn't be doing what he was doing before if he wanted to be.\" According to the doctor, if [Preston] were to be called derogatory names because of his myoclonus, he should report those instances to his supervisors and if action were not taken to stop that harassment, then such would not constitute a calm and supporting work environment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Bourne's evaluation, dated June 22, 2000, assessed only Preston's complaints of psychological problems, including anxiety and depression. The ALJ quoted Dr. Bourne's evaluation at length in his opinion, including the following passage:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is my [Dr. Bourne's] belief that Mr. Preston's psychological condition has been caused by his physical illness and by the deterioration of his health which he perceives. His movement disorder has caused a psychological struggle, which has left him feeling isolated, sensitive and hurt. I do not have the expertise to determine whether any eventual aggravation of the movement disorder is or was due to work conditions, and will defer to the expertise of neurologists concerning that issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, Dr. Kolkin stated that stressful working conditions could aggravate Preston's physical symptoms, even if the aggravation lasted only as long as the stress remained. Dr. Bourne explicitly limited his analysis to Preston's psychological, rather than his physical, problems, and avoided any opinion on whether work conditions aggravated Preston's movement disorder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 2, 2001, the ALJ denied benefits to Preston. In his written order he explained that, to be eligible for benefits, a claimant must first establish a prima facie case, which gives rise to a presumption that his injury was caused by his employment and thus is covered by the Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To establish a <i>prima facie</i> claim for compensation, a claimant need not affirmatively establish a connection between work and harm. Rather, a claimant has the burden of establishing only that (1) the claimant sustained physical harm or pain and (2) an accident occurred in the course of employment, or conditions existed at work, which could have caused the harm or pain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(citations omitted). The ALJ noted that \"[i]f claimant's employment aggravates a non-work-related, underlying disease so as to produce incapacitating symptoms, the resulting disability is compensable.\" He also described the effect of establishing a prima facie case:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once this <i>prima facie</i> case is established, a presumption is created under Section 20(a) [33 U.S.C. &#167; 920(a)]<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> that the employee's injury or death arose out of employment. To rebut that presumption, the party opposing entitlement must present substantial evidence proving the absence of or severing the connection between such harm and employment or working conditions.... If the presumption is rebutted, it no longer controls and the record as a whole must be evaluated to determine the issue of causation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite laying out this analytical framework accurately, the ALJ did not make specific findings as to whether Preston had suffered the ridicule and verbal abuse at work that he had described, or whether the alleged abuse had aggravated the symptoms of his disease. Instead, the ALJ ruled that BIW had adequately rebutted any Section 20(a) presumption of causation through Dr. Kolkin's testimony and Dr. Bourne's evaluation. He analyzed the rebuttal of the Section 20(a) presumption in two passages. In the first, he acknowledged the nature of Preston's claim and then dispatched it summarily:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case sub judice, Claimant alleges that the harm to his bodily frame ... resulted from working conditions at the Employer's shipyard. The Employer has introduced substantial evidence severing the connection between such harm and Claimant's maritime employment. Thus, the presumption falls out of the case, does not control the result and I shall now weigh and evaluate all of the record evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later in the opinion, he revisited BIW's attempt to rebut the Section 20(a) presumption:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he Employer, in this case, has clearly introduced substantial evidence to rebut the presumption with the testimony of Dr. Kolkin, both in his report and in his deposition, and with the testimony of Dr. Bourne. Dr. Kolkin testified that Claimant's condition is the same now as it was six or ten years ago and has not been aggravated or accelerated by his work as a rigger, or by any of the alleged stress in any way in the work environment. Dr. Bourne has testified that Claimant's psychological condition is a chronic adjustment disorder which is caused by his underlying pre-existing disease and which was not caused, accelerated, aggravated or exacerbated by the alleged stress at work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ cited only Dr. Kolkin's testimony and Dr. Bourne's evaluation in determining that BIW had rebutted the Section 20(a) presumption of causation with substantial evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Preston appealed the ALJ's decision to the Board. In its written opinion of January 22, 2002, the Board noted that the ALJ had not made specific findings on whether Preston had actually suffered increased harassment and stress while working at BIW:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the administrative law judge identified claimant's allegations as to \"harm\" and \"working conditions,\" he did not determine whether the alleged stress and harassment at claimant's workplace occurred. Without findings evaluating the conflicting evidence on this issue the Board lacks the proper context for considering whether employer presented substantial evidence in rebuttal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board reasoned that it should remand the case to the ALJ with instructions to determine \"whether [Preston's] condition or its symptoms were aggravated by conditions or an accident at work. Answering this question requires findings identifying the accident or working conditions in existence which could have aggravated [Preston's] condition.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, the Board instructed the ALJ that Dr. Kolkin's testimony and Dr. Bourne's evaluation were, as a matter of law, inadequate to rebut the Section 20(a) presumption of causation if the ALJ found on remand that Preston had established a prima facie case. The Board explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he opinion of Dr. Kolkin actually supports a causal connection rather than rebutting it as the administrative law judge found.... Dr. Kolkin testified that stress could temporarily worsen the symptoms of claimant's myoclonus disease. He also stated that the increase of the involuntary movements would not be permanent but, rather, would dissipate when the stressor was removed.... This medical evidence supports the conclusion that stressful working conditions could have aggravated claimant's condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a footnote, the Board explained that Dr. Bourne's evaluation was also insufficient to rebut the Section 20(a) presumption: \"Dr. Bourne's report addressed only the alleged psychiatric injury and not the physical injury. In fact, Dr. Bourne specifically admitted he has no expertise to determine whether claimant's physical disorder had been aggravated by his employment.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the ALJ stated that, \"having been directed by the Board to reconsider the totality of this closed record on the nature and extent of the Section 20(a) presumption, [I am] now constrained to find and conclude that [Preston] has established a <i>prima facie</i> claim.\" His opinion contained a detailed analysis of the evidence supporting the conclusion that the work environment at BIW had caused stress that aggravated Preston's involuntary shaking. Specifically, the ALJ relied on Preston's testimony, and the testimony of Preston's supervisor, in finding that Preston had been ridiculed at work, that this ridicule caused stress, and that his symptoms had at least worsened temporarily during stressful periods during his twenty years at BIW. Additionally, the ALJ relied on testimony by BIW's own expert medical witnesses in finding that workplace stress could exacerbate Preston's symptoms, if only temporarily, and thus that Preston had established that workplace conditions could have aggravated the symptoms of his underlying condition. The ALJ then found that BIW had not rebutted the Section 20(a) presumption, noting correctly that the Board had ruled as a matter of law that Dr. Kolkin's testimony and Dr. Bourne's evaluation were not sufficient for rebuttal. Finally, the ALJ ruled that Preston's claim was not time barred and that Preston was entitled to benefits based on his weekly wages and medical expenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In making these findings and rulings, the ALJ groused that he had been \"prompted by the Board.\" Specifically, he stated that \"after being prompted by the Board, I now find and conclude that Mr. Preston has introduced ample evidence of harm to invoke the [Section 20(a)] presumption.\" He then added this complaint:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This matter is another example of cases involving my decisions wherein the Board has clearly usurped the functions of this Administrative Law Judge, has clearly substituted its opinions for this trier-of-fact who presided over two days of formal hearings and who alone had the opportunity to hear the testimony and judge the credibility of witnesses testifying under oath before me. In certain cases, the Board has treated the Section 20(a) presumption as virtually an irrebuttable presumption. This matter, in my judgment, is another of those cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BIW appealed this second decision to the Board. Taking some cues from the complaints of the ALJ, it argued that the Board's first decision \"exceeded the scope of its review and usurped the administrative law judge's function as a fact-finder\" because it \"reweighed the evidence and made inappropriate factual determinations in concluding that employer did not establish rebuttal of the Section 20(a) presumption as a matter of law.\" It further argued that the Board had improperly \"required employer to `rule out' any possible causal connection between claimant's employment and his condition in order to establish rebuttal,\" instead of allowing BIW to rebut a Section 20(a) presumption with only \"substantial evidence.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board rejected these arguments. It ruled that its first decision had only required the ALJ to undertake the Section 20(a) analysis mandated by law, which required the ALJ to make specific findings about stress and harassment in Preston's workplace. With respect to its ruling that BIW had not introduced evidence sufficient to rebut a Section 20(a) presumption, the Board wrote that it had merely \"applied the well-established aggravation rule, which provides that where a claimant's employment aggravates, accelerates or combines with a pre-existing condition, the entire resulting disability is compensable.\" Under that rule, BIW could only rebut a Section 20(a) presumption of causation with \"substantial evidence that claimant's condition was not aggravated by his working conditions.\" The Board concluded that \"[a]s none of the physicians opined to `a reasonable degree of medical certainty' that claimant's working conditions did not aggravate his underlying physical condition, employer did not meet its burden of production\" to rebut the Section 20(a) presumption. The Board affirmed the ALJ's second decision because BIW had \"not challenge[d] the administrative law judge's findings invoking Section 20(a)\" and had \"not point [ed] to any evidence sufficient to rebut Section 20(a).\" Finally, the Board affirmed the ALJ's rulings on the timeliness of Preston's filing and the award of benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal to this court, BIW argues primarily that the Board erred in overturning the ALJ's first decision. It further argues that both the Board and the ALJ, in the second round of decisions, erred in (1) finding that Preston filed his claim in a timely fashion, (2) finding that Preston was \"disabled\" within the meaning of the Act and was therefore entitled to benefits, (3) determining Preston's average weekly wage for the purpose of calculating the award of benefits, and (4) considering the question of medical benefits even though the parties had agreed to litigate that issue at a later date. We take each of these arguments in turn. \"This court reviews the [Board's] decision on legal issues de novo and determines whether the Board adhered to the `substantial evidence' standard when it reviewed the [ALJ's] factual findings.\" <i>Bath Iron Works v. Brown,</i> 194 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Board's First Decision</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"In order for an injury to be covered by the Act, the claimant must initially make out a prima facie case. That is, a claimant `must at least allege an injury that arose in the course of employment as well as out of employment.'\" <i>Brown,</i> 194 F.3d at 4 (quoting <i>U.S. Indus./Fed. Sheet Metal, Inc. v. Director, OWCP,</i> 455 U.S. 608, 615, 102 S.Ct. 1312, 71 L.Ed.2d 495 (1982)). To establish a prima facie case, a claimant must make two showings: (1) that he \"sustained physical harm\" and (2) \"that conditions existed at work which could have caused the harm.\" <i>Susoeff v. San FranciscoStevedoring Co.,</i> 19 Ben. Rev. Bd. Serv. 149, 151 (1986). Thus, to make his prima facie case, the claimant is not required to show a causal connection between the harm and his working conditions, but rather must show only that the harm <i>could have been</i> caused by his working conditions. For the purposes of making a claim under the Act, the physical harm alleged can be the aggravation of a previously existing condition. <i>See Gardner v. Director, OWCP,</i> 640 F.2d 1385, 1389 (1st Cir.1981) (holding that aggravation of claimant's symptoms from a previously existing venous condition was compensable under the Act); <i>Strachan Shipping Co. v. Nash,</i> 782 F.2d 513, 517 (5th Cir.1986) (\"[W]here an employment injury worsens or combines with a preexisting impairment to produce a disability greater than that which would have resulted from the employment injury alone, the entire resulting disability is compensable.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once a claimant makes a prima facie case, he is entitled to a presumption that the injury was caused by his working conditions and is therefore compensable under the Act. 33 U.S.C. &#167; 920(a); <i>see also Brown,</i> 194 F.3d at 5 (\"Once [claimant] made out his prima facie case, there was a presumption of liability.\"). An employer can rebut this so-called \"Section 20(a)\" presumption by demonstrating, through substantial evidence,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> that the injury was not caused by the claimant's working conditions. <i>See Brown,</i> 194 F.3d at 5; <i>Sprague v. Director, OWCP,</i> 688 F.2d 862, 865 (1st Cir.1982). If an employer introduces substantial evidence severing the causal connection between the injury and claimant's working conditions, \"the presumption `falls' out of the case.\" <i>Sprague,</i> 688 F.2d at 866 n. 7. In that instance, the claimant bears the burden of showing, \"based on the record as a whole,\" that his injury was caused by his working conditions. <i>Brown,</i> 194 F.3d at 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BIW contends that the Board erred in its first decision by ruling that the ALJ had not made sufficient \"findings identifying the accident or working conditions in existence which could have aggravated [Preston's] condition.\" Rather, BIW argues that the ALJ found in his first decision that Preston had suffered stress on the job that could have aggravated his condition, determined that Preston had established a prima facie case entitling him to the Section 20(a) presumption of causation, but then ruled that BIW had rebutted that presumption with substantial evidence that personal factors unrelated to work caused claimant's stress and worsened his condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BIW points to a single statement from the ALJ's first decision to support its argument that he made the necessary findings on stress and harassment: \"I may properly rely on Claimant's credible testimony to establish that he experienced a work-related harm, if the record reflects the presence of working conditions that could have caused the harm, thereby invoking the Section 20(a) presumption.\" This is a contingent finding &#8212; \"if the record reflects....\" The ALJ never stated whether \"the record reflects the presence of working conditions that could have caused the harm.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast, the ALJ made explicit findings about Preston's work environment in his second decision. Specifically, he found that Preston was \"routinely called `Shake and Bake'\" and that \"[t]his nickname was so pervasive that at least some employees did not know [Preston] by his real name.\" He further found that Preston \"was subjected to <i>ad hominum</i> [sic] and dehumanizing remarks about a genetic condition he could not do anything to change,\" that \"even though his job performance was good, he was subjected to constant name calling and pranks,\" and that \"[s]urely, ridicule for an inherited condition would make the usual stress of a job worse for anyone.\" He concluded that Preston's \"stressful working conditions aggravated, accelerated and exacerbated his pre-existing and chronic neurological disorder.\" In the absence of such findings in the ALJ's first decision, the Board was entitled to remand the case to the ALJ.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BIW next argues that the Board's first decision ignored the ALJ's findings that the evidence \"as a whole\" did not support a causal connection between the aggravation of Preston's symptoms and his workplace conditions. This argument, however, skips several steps in the proper analysis. The ALJ could only consider \"the record as a whole\" after finding that (1) Preston had established a prima facie case and was therefore entitled to the Section 20(a) presumption, and (2) BIW had rebutted the Section 20(a) presumption. In reviewing the ALJ's first decision, the Board never reached the ALJ's analysis of the \"record as a whole\" because it found that the ALJ had not made the factual findings about Preston's workplace conditions necessary to determine whether Preston had established a prima facie case. Thus, the ALJ's analysis of whether the \"record as a whole\" supported a causal connection between Preston's injury and his work environment was irrelevant to the question remanded by the Board in its first decision: whether Preston's work environment had caused stress that could have aggravated his condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BIW also argues that the Board usurped the ALJ's fact finding authority in its first decision when it stated that Dr. Kolkin's testimony and Dr. Bourne's evaluation were not sufficient to rebut the Section 20(a) presumption. This conclusion of the Board, however, was a legal conclusion. There was no disagreement between the ALJ and the Board about the substance of the testimony or its credibility. Rather, the Board concluded that, \"as Dr. Kolkin opined that stress could aggravate claimant's pre-existing condition,\" his testimony could not, as a matter of law, sever the causal link between Preston's aggravated symptoms and his work environment. Thus, it could not rebut a Section 20(a) presumption that Preston's injury was caused by his work environment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the Board emphasized that Dr. Bourne's evaluation only addressed Preston's mental state, and that Dr. Bourne had specifically declined to comment on Preston's physical symptoms. It ruled that testimony about Preston's <i>mental</i> state could not rebut a Section 20(a) presumption that Preston's <i>physical</i> injury was caused by his workplace environment. The Board's conclusions about Dr. Kolkin's testimony and Dr. Bourne's evaluation did not usurp the ALJ's authority to make findings of fact; rather they addressed only the legal sufficiency of that evidence to rebut the Section 20(a) presumption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Board's Second Decision<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Timely Notice</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BIW argues that Preston did not file a claim within the time period specified by the Act, and therefore his claim is barred. The Act imposes two separate time limits for filing a workers' compensation claim. In the case of a \"traumatic injury,\" an employee must give notice to his employer within thirty days of the injury. 33 U.S.C. &#167; 912(a). In the case of an \"occupational injury\" that does not immediately result in disability, the employee must notify the employer within one year after the employee becomes aware, or should have become aware, \"of the relationship between the employment, the disease, and the ... disability.\" <i>Id.</i> However, \"[f]ailure to give such notice [required by &#167; 912(a)] shall not bar any claim under this chapter (1) if the employer ... or the carrier had knowledge of the injury.\" 33 U.S.C. &#167; 912(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his second decision, the ALJ ruled that BIW had actual knowledge of the aggravation of Preston's condition on September 22, 1997, when Preston and his union representative met with the medical staff of BIW at the shipyard infirmary. Records from that meeting indicate that Preston \"discuss[ed] his tremors and indicat[ed] he is feeling uncomfortable due to coworker pressure and a worsening of his condition.\" Preston also indicated that his tremors were \"worse when under stress\" and that his \"coworkers are concerned about their safety and often made fun of him.\" This record constitutes substantial evidence that BIW was aware of Preston's injury as early as September 22, 1997. Thus, the ALJ ruled correctly that Preston's failure to formally notify BIW was excused pursuant to &#167; 912(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ also offered an alternative basis for finding that Preston's claim was not barred, ruling that Preston did not know until August 28, 1998, that his aggravated condition would prevent him from continuing his employment. On that date, Dr. Carcini evaluated Preston and suggested that he should stop work immediately. Dr. Carcini also composed a letter on that date to the referring physician stating that \"I do feel that he is having a lot of movement problems that prohibit safe operation of a crane at work. I would like to take him out of work immediately and make plans for disability or perhaps another type of job.\" Since this recommendation from Dr. Carcini was the first notice Preston received that he could not continue to work, the ALJ ruled that August 28, 1998, was the date from which the time period for notifying his employer should be measured. <i>See Bechtel Assocs., P.C., v. Sweeney,</i> 834 F.2d 1029, 1033 (D.C.Cir.1987) (\"[T]he limitation period begins only when the employee knows or should know that (1) his injury is causally related to his employment and (2) his injury is impairing his capacity to earn wages.\"). BIW received a copy of Dr. Carcini's letter, and therefore was aware shortly after August 28, 1998, that the aggravation of Preston's condition was due to his work environment and prevented him from adequately performing his job. Therefore, pursuant to &#167; 912(d), Preston's claim could not be time barred because BIW had actual knowledge of Preston's injury shortly after August 28, 1998, the date on which the limitations period began to run.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Entitlement to Benefits</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BIW contends that Preston is not entitled to benefits because substantial evidence did not support the ALJ's finding in his second decision that Preston was \"totally disabled\" within the meaning of the Act. BIW argues that the evidence before the ALJ demonstrated that Preston's condition was aggravated by other factors, including his family life and struggle with alcohol abuse, rather than by his working conditions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Act defines disability as \"incapacity because of injury to earn the wages which the employee was receiving at the time of injury in the same or any other employment.\" 33 U.S.C. &#167; 902(10). Thus, \"[t]o establish a <i>prima facie</i> case of total disability, claimant must show that he is unable to return to his usual employment\" because of his injury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>Delay v. Jones Washington Stevedoring Co.,</i> 31 Ben. Rev. Bd. Serv. 197 (1998). \"Once a claimant demonstrates an inability to return to his job because of a work-related injury, he is considered totally disabled within the meaning of [the Act] and the burden shifts to the employer to prove the availability of suitable alternative employment in the claimant's community.\" <i>Palombo v. Director, OWCP,</i> 937 F.2d 70, 71 (2d Cir.1991). In this case, BIW offered no evidence regarding the availability of alternative employment and thus relies only on the argument that Preston did not establish a prima facie case of disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ concluded that the \"record leads inescapably to the conclusion that claimant cannot return to work as a crane operator at the employer's shipyard.\" In making this determination, the ALJ relied on the testimony of Preston's supervisor, who stated that Preston was subjected to name calling and practical jokes, and that his tremors had become so pronounced that other members of his crew questioned whether Preston could safely perform his work. The ALJ also relied on Dr. Kolkin's testimony that Preston needed a \"calm and supporting work environment,\" and noted that the teasing and ridicule that Preston suffered, combined with normal stresses associated with working in a shipyard setting, did not constitute such an environment. Finally, he relied on the opinions of Dr. Carcini and Dr. David G. Standaert, another of Preston's treating physicians, that Preston's aggravated symptoms prevented him from safely performing the tasks required by his employment. He concluded that \"the medical evidence establishes that all of the doctors who have expressed an opinion on [Preston's] ability to operate a crane are in agreement that he cannot safely do so.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This testimony by Preston's supervisor and by several medical experts, along with Preston's own contentions, constitute substantial evidence that Preston cannot perform his usual work at the BIW shipyard. Thus, the ALJ was entitled to find that Preston was totally disabled within the meaning of the Act and was entitled to benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Calculation of Preston's Average Weekly Wage</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The amount of a disabled employee's award of benefits under the Act depends on the average weekly wage that the employee earned while employed. <i>See</i> 33 U.S.C. &#167; 908 (stating formulas for calculating disability benefits based on an employee's average weekly wage). Pursuant to 33 U.S.C. &#167; 910, an ALJ can calculate an employee's average weekly wage in several ways. If a claimant was employed for substantially the whole year prior to the injury, &#167; 910(a) instructs that the average annual earnings should be calculated by determining the average daily wage during the period worked, and multiplying that number by either 260, if the employee was a five-day worker, or 300, if the employee was a six-day worker. That annual figure is then divided by fifty-two to determine the average weekly wage. &#167; 910(d)(1). If, however, an employee has not worked substantially all of the previous year, &#167; 910(b) provides that the average weekly wage should be determined by looking at the wages earned by employees of the same class, in the same or similar employment, and in the same or a neighboring location. Where neither &#167; 910(a) or &#167; 910(b) can be properly applied, &#167; 910(c) requires that the average annual wage used to calculate the average weekly wage \"shall reasonably represent the annual earning capacity of the injured employee.\" Section 910(c) does not provide a precise method for determining an employee's annual earning capacity, but it does state that the ALJ should consider the previous earnings of the employee as well as the earnings of similarly situated employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the record included wage information only for the final thirty-nine weeks of the fifty-two weeks preceding the filing of Preston's complaint, and it showed no earnings for eight of those thirty-nine weeks. Moreover, the record did not indicate whether Preston had been a six-day per week or five-day per week worker. The ALJ reasoned that this partial record was not sufficient to determine Preston's average weekly wage under &#167; 910(a). The ALJ also ruled that the \"paucity of evidence as to the wages earned by a comparable employee\" prevented him from determining Preston's average weekly wage pursuant to &#167; 910(b). Finding that neither &#167; 910(a) nor &#167; 910(b) could be \"reasonably and fairly applied,\" the ALJ calculated the average weekly wage pursuant to &#167; 910(c). <i>See Story v. Navy Exch. Serv. Ctr.,</i> 30 Ben. Rev. Bd. Serv. 225 (1997) (holding that &#167; 910(c) is a catch-all provision to be applied when neither &#167; 910(a) nor &#167; 910(b) can be reasonably and fairly applied).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ calculated Preston's average weekly wage by taking the wages that Preston earned during the thirty-nine weeks accounted for in the wage report ($20,456.35), and dividing that amount by thirty-one weeks (thirty-nine weeks minus the eight weeks for which the wage report indicated no earnings). This calculation led the ALJ to find that Preston's average weekly wage was $659.88. BIW argues that the ALJ should have calculated the average weekly wage pursuant to &#167; 910(a) by dividing Preston's earnings during the previous thirty-nine week period by thirty-nine, thereby including in the calculation the eight weeks in which, according to the wage report, Preston performed no work. BIW's suggested method would have resulted in an average weekly wage of $524.50.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The essential purpose of the average weekly wage determination is to reflect `a claimant's annual earning capacity <i>at the time of the injury.</i>\"' <i>Hall v. Consol. Employment Sys., Inc.,</i> 139 F.3d 1025, 1031 (5th Cir.1998) (citation omitted) (emphasis in original). The ALJ's determination in this respect is subject to the \"substantial evidence\" standard. <i>Id.</i> at 1031-32. In this case, the record contained only partial information about Preston's work history over the previous year, with no indication of whether he worked five days or six days per week. Since these factors are critical to the calculation of an average weekly wage under &#167; 910(a), the ALJ was entitled to find that &#167; 910(a) could not be \"reasonably and fairly applied.\" Moreover, in calculating Preston's average weekly wage under &#167; 910(c), the ALJ accounted for the fact that Preston's condition, aggravated or otherwise, might limit his ability to consistently perform a full work week. The thirty-one weeks used in the ALJ's calculation included a wide range of hours worked, from 4.5 to 51.8, and thus presumably included weeks in which Preston took time off because of his aggravated condition. If anything, the ALJ's calculation likely underestimated the amount that Preston could have earned if he had not been dealing with aggravated symptoms caused by his work environment. Therefore, substantial evidence supported the ALJ's calculation of Preston's average weekly wage pursuant to &#167; 910(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. Medical Benefits</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, BIW argues that the ALJ erred in granting Preston medical benefits pursuant to 33 U.S.C. &#167; 907 because the parties had agreed to litigate the propriety of medical benefits only after litigating whether Preston's injuries were work related. The Board vacated the portion of the ALJ's decision granting any specific medical expenses, ruling that the parties could litigate or reach agreement on the \"reasonable necessity of medical treatment\" at a future date. However, it affirmed the ALJ's general finding that Preston was entitled to medical benefits under &#167; 907.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the Board's decision on this issue. Section 907(a) provides that an \"employer shall furnish such medical ... treatment ... as the nature of the injury ... may require.\" Thus, if a claimant is found to have suffered an \"injury\" as defined under the Act, he is generally entitled to medical benefits pursuant to &#167; 907(a). <i>See Ingalls Shipbuilding, Inc., v. Director, OWCP,</i> 991 F.2d 163, 165 (5th Cir.1993) (stating that &#167; 907 \"entitles a claimant to reasonable and necessary medical services if he suffers a work-related injury\"). Our holding does not, however, prevent the parties from further litigating the propriety or reasonableness of any specific medical expense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the Board is AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> 33 U.S.C. &#167; 920 provides in relevant part:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">In any proceeding for the enforcement of a claim for compensation under this Act it shall be presumed, in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary &#8212;</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(a) that the claim comes within the provisions of this chapter.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> \"Substantial evidence\" is \"such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\"<i>Sprague v.

Pursuant to well-established precedent, we decline to address this argument. \"[A]rguments raised in a reply brief are insufficient to preserve a claim on appeal.\"<i>Frazier v. Bailey,</i> 957 F.2d 920, 932 n. 14 (1st Cir.1992). However, to dispel any notion of unfairness to BIW, we make three points: (1) The Board did not order the ALJ to find that Preston had experienced stress and harassment in the workplace. It simply ordered him to find whether they had occurred. (2) To the extent that the ALJ read the Board's decision as requiring him to find in favor of Preston, he misread the Board's decision. (3) Most importantly, there was substantial evidence in the record to support the ALJ's findings in favor of Preston.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The establishment of a \"disability\" is distinct from the establishment of an \"injury\" covered by the Act, which we discussed<i>supra</i> Part III.A. <i>See Bath Iron Works Corp. v.

After the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) denied benefits, Preston appealed to the Benefits Review Board (the Board). In vacating the ALJ's decision, the Board ruled that the ALJ had not determined whether the stress and harassment claimed by Preston had occurred, and it remanded for further consideration. On remand, the ALJ made the requisite findings on stress and harassment and reversed his earlier disposition by granting benefits to Preston. BIW appealed the ALJ's second decision, and the Board affirmed. BIW now appeals to this court, arguing primarily that the Board erred in overturning the ALJ's first decision denying benefits. It also challenges rulings in the Board's second decision. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We derive the following facts from the record before the ALJ. We relate only those facts necessary to dispose of the issues on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Michael Preston suffers from a hereditary neurological disorder called paramyoclonus multiplex, which causes involuntary shaking of his head and arms. Preston has suffered symptoms of the disease from approximately age ten until the present. The involuntary shaking tends to become worse when he is under stress. When the stress subsides, however, his symptoms usually subside.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From 1978 until 1998, Preston worked at the BIW shipyard in Bath, Maine. He began work as a \"rigger,\" which required him to attach shackles to ship components &#8212; which often weighed between 100 and 150 tons &#8212; so that they could be picked up by a crane. Typically, he worked as part of a six to eight person crew, and most of his work was done on the ground or in a hydraulic lift called a \"cherry picker.\" In the last six to eight years of his career, Preston spent about half of his time at work as a crane operator, maneuvering cranes that sat on tracks approximately forty feet above the floor of the assembly area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Preston alleges that, during his twenty years at BIW, he was ridiculed, called derogatory names, and subjected to practical jokes because of the symptoms of his disease. Members of his crew referred to him as \"Shake and Bake\" and would sometimes try to startle him so that his shaking would become more pronounced. This harassment caused stress, which in turn exacerbated Preston's symptoms. As his shaking worsened, he began to worry that he could not safely perform his job. In a harmful cycle, this concern caused even greater stress which further aggravated his symptoms. As his symptoms grew worse, he claims that his coworkers began to question whether he was a danger to his crew.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of these difficulties at work, Preston began to take time off to get his symptoms under control. On the advice of his treating physician, Dr. Stephanie Carcini, he stopped working altogether on August 28, 1998. He reports that his symptoms have improved since he stopped working.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 22, 1998, Preston filed a claim for benefits under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (the Act), 33 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 901-950. On November 4, 1998, BIW controverted Preston's claim. An ALJ held hearings on April 17 and April 19, 2000, during which both parties presented evidence, including the expert testimony of several physicians. Preston argued that the working conditions at BIW so aggravated the symptoms of his disorder that he could not continue working. BIW contended that any teasing or ridicule at the shipyard was minor and that any deterioration in Preston's condition was due to other stressful events in his life, such as struggles with his family life and his recurring problems with alcohol abuse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence offered by BIW included the testimony of a neurologist, Dr. Seth Kolkin, and an evaluation conducted by a psychiatrist, Dr. David J. Bourne. In his written decision, the ALJ described Dr. Kolkin's testimony about whether stress could aggravate Preston's conditions:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Kolkin ... testified that stress can worsen the involuntary movements associated with myoclonus but only as a temporary aggravation, that any improvement of that temporary condition \"depends on the exact situation and his levels of concentration, medications, fatigue, motivation\" and that [Preston] advised the doctor that he found his work to be stressful \"because of depression and difficulties at work.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">... [T]he doctor agree[d] [that] \"[s]tress, depression[,] any volition, motivation, any degree of psychological state\" would affect [Preston's] movements....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the doctor, stress and fatigue will \"transiently\" exacerbate [Preston's] symptoms, that the exacerbation would last for the \"duration of the fatigue or stress\" and \"once that stress is resolved (the person) would be back at (his) baseline,\" the doctor remarking that it would take \"moments\" to return to baseline after the stress is removed and that [Preston] \"could work if he had a calm, supportive environment,\" and \"that if he were motivated and given some latitude and encouragement and support, there is no reason why he couldn't be doing what he was doing before if he wanted to be.\" According to the doctor, if [Preston] were to be called derogatory names because of his myoclonus, he should report those instances to his supervisors and if action were not taken to stop that harassment, then such would not constitute a calm and supporting work environment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Bourne's evaluation, dated June 22, 2000, assessed only Preston's complaints of psychological problems, including anxiety and depression. The ALJ quoted Dr. Bourne's evaluation at length in his opinion, including the following passage:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is my [Dr. Bourne's] belief that Mr. Preston's psychological condition has been caused by his physical illness and by the deterioration of his health which he perceives. His movement disorder has caused a psychological struggle, which has left him feeling isolated, sensitive and hurt. I do not have the expertise to determine whether any eventual aggravation of the movement disorder is or was due to work conditions, and will defer to the expertise of neurologists concerning that issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, Dr. Kolkin stated that stressful working conditions could aggravate Preston's physical symptoms, even if the aggravation lasted only as long as the stress remained. Dr. Bourne explicitly limited his analysis to Preston's psychological, rather than his physical, problems, and avoided any opinion on whether work conditions aggravated Preston's movement disorder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 2, 2001, the ALJ denied benefits to Preston. In his written order he explained that, to be eligible for benefits, a claimant must first establish a prima facie case, which gives rise to a presumption that his injury was caused by his employment and thus is covered by the Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To establish a <i>prima facie</i> claim for compensation, a claimant need not affirmatively establish a connection between work and harm. Rather, a claimant has the burden of establishing only that (1) the claimant sustained physical harm or pain and (2) an accident occurred in the course of employment, or conditions existed at work, which could have caused the harm or pain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(citations omitted). The ALJ noted that \"[i]f claimant's employment aggravates a non-work-related, underlying disease so as to produce incapacitating symptoms, the resulting disability is compensable.\" He also described the effect of establishing a prima facie case:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once this <i>prima facie</i> case is established, a presumption is created under Section 20(a) [33 U.S.C. &#167; 920(a)]<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> that the employee's injury or death arose out of employment. To rebut that presumption, the party opposing entitlement must present substantial evidence proving the absence of or severing the connection between such harm and employment or working conditions.... If the presumption is rebutted, it no longer controls and the record as a whole must be evaluated to determine the issue of causation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite laying out this analytical framework accurately, the ALJ did not make specific findings as to whether Preston had suffered the ridicule and verbal abuse at work that he had described, or whether the alleged abuse had aggravated the symptoms of his disease. Instead, the ALJ ruled that BIW had adequately rebutted any Section 20(a) presumption of causation through Dr. Kolkin's testimony and Dr. Bourne's evaluation. He analyzed the rebuttal of the Section 20(a) presumption in two passages. In the first, he acknowledged the nature of Preston's claim and then dispatched it summarily:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case sub judice, Claimant alleges that the harm to his bodily frame ... resulted from working conditions at the Employer's shipyard. The Employer has introduced substantial evidence severing the connection between such harm and Claimant's maritime employment. Thus, the presumption falls out of the case, does not control the result and I shall now weigh and evaluate all of the record evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later in the opinion, he revisited BIW's attempt to rebut the Section 20(a) presumption:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he Employer, in this case, has clearly introduced substantial evidence to rebut the presumption with the testimony of Dr. Kolkin, both in his report and in his deposition, and with the testimony of Dr. Bourne. Dr. Kolkin testified that Claimant's condition is the same now as it was six or ten years ago and has not been aggravated or accelerated by his work as a rigger, or by any of the alleged stress in any way in the work environment. Dr. Bourne has testified that Claimant's psychological condition is a chronic adjustment disorder which is caused by his underlying pre-existing disease and which was not caused, accelerated, aggravated or exacerbated by the alleged stress at work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ cited only Dr. Kolkin's testimony and Dr. Bourne's evaluation in determining that BIW had rebutted the Section 20(a) presumption of causation with substantial evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Preston appealed the ALJ's decision to the Board. In its written opinion of January 22, 2002, the Board noted that the ALJ had not made specific findings on whether Preston had actually suffered increased harassment and stress while working at BIW:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the administrative law judge identified claimant's allegations as to \"harm\" and \"working conditions,\" he did not determine whether the alleged stress and harassment at claimant's workplace occurred. Without findings evaluating the conflicting evidence on this issue the Board lacks the proper context for considering whether employer presented substantial evidence in rebuttal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board reasoned that it should remand the case to the ALJ with instructions to determine \"whether [Preston's] condition or its symptoms were aggravated by conditions or an accident at work. Answering this question requires findings identifying the accident or working conditions in existence which could have aggravated [Preston's] condition.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, the Board instructed the ALJ that Dr. Kolkin's testimony and Dr. Bourne's evaluation were, as a matter of law, inadequate to rebut the Section 20(a) presumption of causation if the ALJ found on remand that Preston had established a prima facie case. The Board explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he opinion of Dr. Kolkin actually supports a causal connection rather than rebutting it as the administrative law judge found.... Dr. Kolkin testified that stress could temporarily worsen the symptoms of claimant's myoclonus disease. He also stated that the increase of the involuntary movements would not be permanent but, rather, would dissipate when the stressor was removed.... This medical evidence supports the conclusion that stressful working conditions could have aggravated claimant's condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a footnote, the Board explained that Dr. Bourne's evaluation was also insufficient to rebut the Section 20(a) presumption: \"Dr. Bourne's report addressed only the alleged psychiatric injury and not the physical injury. In fact, Dr. Bourne specifically admitted he has no expertise to determine whether claimant's physical disorder had been aggravated by his employment.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the ALJ stated that, \"having been directed by the Board to reconsider the totality of this closed record on the nature and extent of the Section 20(a) presumption, [I am] now constrained to find and conclude that [Preston] has established a <i>prima facie</i> claim.\" His opinion contained a detailed analysis of the evidence supporting the conclusion that the work environment at BIW had caused stress that aggravated Preston's involuntary shaking. Specifically, the ALJ relied on Preston's testimony, and the testimony of Preston's supervisor, in finding that Preston had been ridiculed at work, that this ridicule caused stress, and that his symptoms had at least worsened temporarily during stressful periods during his twenty years at BIW. Additionally, the ALJ relied on testimony by BIW's own expert medical witnesses in finding that workplace stress could exacerbate Preston's symptoms, if only temporarily, and thus that Preston had established that workplace conditions could have aggravated the symptoms of his underlying condition. The ALJ then found that BIW had not rebutted the Section 20(a) presumption, noting correctly that the Board had ruled as a matter of law that Dr. Kolkin's testimony and Dr. Bourne's evaluation were not sufficient for rebuttal. Finally, the ALJ ruled that Preston's claim was not time barred and that Preston was entitled to benefits based on his weekly wages and medical expenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In making these findings and rulings, the ALJ groused that he had been \"prompted by the Board.\" Specifically, he stated that \"after being prompted by the Board, I now find and conclude that Mr. Preston has introduced ample evidence of harm to invoke the [Section 20(a)] presumption.\" He then added this complaint:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This matter is another example of cases involving my decisions wherein the Board has clearly usurped the functions of this Administrative Law Judge, has clearly substituted its opinions for this trier-of-fact who presided over two days of formal hearings and who alone had the opportunity to hear the testimony and judge the credibility of witnesses testifying under oath before me. In certain cases, the Board has treated the Section 20(a) presumption as virtually an irrebuttable presumption. This matter, in my judgment, is another of those cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BIW appealed this second decision to the Board. Taking some cues from the complaints of the ALJ, it argued that the Board's first decision \"exceeded the scope of its review and usurped the administrative law judge's function as a fact-finder\" because it \"reweighed the evidence and made inappropriate factual determinations in concluding that employer did not establish rebuttal of the Section 20(a) presumption as a matter of law.\" It further argued that the Board had improperly \"required employer to `rule out' any possible causal connection between claimant's employment and his condition in order to establish rebuttal,\" instead of allowing BIW to rebut a Section 20(a) presumption with only \"substantial evidence.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board rejected these arguments. It ruled that its first decision had only required the ALJ to undertake the Section 20(a) analysis mandated by law, which required the ALJ to make specific findings about stress and harassment in Preston's workplace. With respect to its ruling that BIW had not introduced evidence sufficient to rebut a Section 20(a) presumption, the Board wrote that it had merely \"applied the well-established aggravation rule, which provides that where a claimant's employment aggravates, accelerates or combines with a pre-existing condition, the entire resulting disability is compensable.\" Under that rule, BIW could only rebut a Section 20(a) presumption of causation with \"substantial evidence that claimant's condition was not aggravated by his working conditions.\" The Board concluded that \"[a]s none of the physicians opined to `a reasonable degree of medical certainty' that claimant's working conditions did not aggravate his underlying physical condition, employer did not meet its burden of production\" to rebut the Section 20(a) presumption. The Board affirmed the ALJ's second decision because BIW had \"not challenge[d] the administrative law judge's findings invoking Section 20(a)\" and had \"not point [ed] to any evidence sufficient to rebut Section 20(a).\" Finally, the Board affirmed the ALJ's rulings on the timeliness of Preston's filing and the award of benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal to this court, BIW argues primarily that the Board erred in overturning the ALJ's first decision. It further argues that both the Board and the ALJ, in the second round of decisions, erred in (1) finding that Preston filed his claim in a timely fashion, (2) finding that Preston was \"disabled\" within the meaning of the Act and was therefore entitled to benefits, (3) determining Preston's average weekly wage for the purpose of calculating the award of benefits, and (4) considering the question of medical benefits even though the parties had agreed to litigate that issue at a later date. We take each of these arguments in turn. \"This court reviews the [Board's] decision on legal issues de novo and determines whether the Board adhered to the `substantial evidence' standard when it reviewed the [ALJ's] factual findings.\" <i>Bath Iron Works v.

Thus, to make his prima facie case, the claimant is not required to show a causal connection between the harm and his working conditions, but rather must show only that the harm <i>could have been</i> caused by his working conditions.

Specifically, he found that Preston was \"routinely called `Shake and Bake'\" and that \"[t]his nickname was so pervasive that at least some employees did not know [Preston] by his real name.\" He further found that Preston \"was subjected to <i>ad hominum</i> [sic] and dehumanizing remarks about a genetic condition he could not do anything to change,\" that \"even though his job performance was good, he was subjected to constant name calling and pranks,\" and that \"[s]urely, ridicule for an inherited condition would make the usual stress of a job worse for anyone.\" He concluded that Preston's \"stressful working conditions aggravated, accelerated and exacerbated his pre-existing and chronic neurological disorder.\" In the absence of such findings in the ALJ's first decision, the Board was entitled to remand the case to the ALJ.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BIW next argues that the Board's first decision ignored the ALJ's findings that the evidence \"as a whole\" did not support a causal connection between the aggravation of Preston's symptoms and his workplace conditions. This argument, however, skips several steps in the proper analysis. The ALJ could only consider \"the record as a whole\" after finding that (1) Preston had established a prima facie case and was therefore entitled to the Section 20(a) presumption, and (2) BIW had rebutted the Section 20(a) presumption. In reviewing the ALJ's first decision, the Board never reached the ALJ's analysis of the \"record as a whole\" because it found that the ALJ had not made the factual findings about Preston's workplace conditions necessary to determine whether Preston had established a prima facie case. Thus, the ALJ's analysis of whether the \"record as a whole\" supported a causal connection between Preston's injury and his work environment was irrelevant to the question remanded by the Board in its first decision: whether Preston's work environment had caused stress that could have aggravated his condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BIW also argues that the Board usurped the ALJ's fact finding authority in its first decision when it stated that Dr. Kolkin's testimony and Dr. Bourne's evaluation were not sufficient to rebut the Section 20(a) presumption. This conclusion of the Board, however, was a legal conclusion. There was no disagreement between the ALJ and the Board about the substance of the testimony or its credibility. Rather, the Board concluded that, \"as Dr. Kolkin opined that stress could aggravate claimant's pre-existing condition,\" his testimony could not, as a matter of law, sever the causal link between Preston's aggravated symptoms and his work environment. Thus, it could not rebut a Section 20(a) presumption that Preston's injury was caused by his work environment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the Board emphasized that Dr. Bourne's evaluation only addressed Preston's mental state, and that Dr. Bourne had specifically declined to comment on Preston's physical symptoms. It ruled that testimony about Preston's <i>mental</i> state could not rebut a Section 20(a) presumption that Preston's <i>physical</i> injury was caused by his workplace environment. The Board's conclusions about Dr. Kolkin's testimony and Dr. Bourne's evaluation did not usurp the ALJ's authority to make findings of fact; rather they addressed only the legal sufficiency of that evidence to rebut the Section 20(a) presumption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Board's Second Decision<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Timely Notice</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BIW argues that Preston did not file a claim within the time period specified by the Act, and therefore his claim is barred. The Act imposes two separate time limits for filing a workers' compensation claim. In the case of a \"traumatic injury,\" an employee must give notice to his employer within thirty days of the injury. 33 U.S.C. &#167; 912(a). In the case of an \"occupational injury\" that does not immediately result in disability, the employee must notify the employer within one year after the employee becomes aware, or should have become aware, \"of the relationship between the employment, the disease, and the ... disability.\" <i>Id.</i> However, \"[f]ailure to give such notice [required by &#167; 912(a)] shall not bar any claim under this chapter (1) if the employer ... or the carrier had knowledge of the injury.\" 33 U.S.C. &#167; 912(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his second decision, the ALJ ruled that BIW had actual knowledge of the aggravation of Preston's condition on September 22, 1997, when Preston and his union representative met with the medical staff of BIW at the shipyard infirmary. Records from that meeting indicate that Preston \"discuss[ed] his tremors and indicat[ed] he is feeling uncomfortable due to coworker pressure and a worsening of his condition.\" Preston also indicated that his tremors were \"worse when under stress\" and that his \"coworkers are concerned about their safety and often made fun of him.\" This record constitutes substantial evidence that BIW was aware of Preston's injury as early as September 22, 1997. Thus, the ALJ ruled correctly that Preston's failure to formally notify BIW was excused pursuant to &#167; 912(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ also offered an alternative basis for finding that Preston's claim was not barred, ruling that Preston did not know until August 28, 1998, that his aggravated condition would prevent him from continuing his employment. On that date, Dr. Carcini evaluated Preston and suggested that he should stop work immediately. Dr. Carcini also composed a letter on that date to the referring physician stating that \"I do feel that he is having a lot of movement problems that prohibit safe operation of a crane at work. I would like to take him out of work immediately and make plans for disability or perhaps another type of job.\" Since this recommendation from Dr. Carcini was the first notice Preston received that he could not continue to work, the ALJ ruled that August 28, 1998, was the date from which the time period for notifying his employer should be measured. <i>See Bechtel Assocs., P.C., v. Sweeney,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"498376\"><a href=\"/opinion/498376/bechtel-associates-pc-and-lumbermens-mutual-casualty-co-v-sally-t/\"><span class=\"volume\">834</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1029</span></a></span>, 1033 (D.C.Cir.1987) (\"[T]he limitation period begins only when the employee knows or should know that (1) his injury is causally related to his employment and (2) his injury is impairing his capacity to earn wages.\"). BIW received a copy of Dr. Carcini's letter, and therefore was aware shortly after August 28, 1998, that the aggravation of Preston's condition was due to his work environment and prevented him from adequately performing his job. Therefore, pursuant to &#167; 912(d), Preston's claim could not be time barred because BIW had actual knowledge of Preston's injury shortly after August 28, 1998, the date on which the limitations period began to run.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Entitlement to Benefits</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BIW contends that Preston is not entitled to benefits because substantial evidence did not support the ALJ's finding in his second decision that Preston was \"totally disabled\" within the meaning of the Act. BIW argues that the evidence before the ALJ demonstrated that Preston's condition was aggravated by other factors, including his family life and struggle with alcohol abuse, rather than by his working conditions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Act defines disability as \"incapacity because of injury to earn the wages which the employee was receiving at the time of injury in the same or any other employment.\" 33 U.S.C. &#167; 902(10). Thus, \"[t]o establish a <i>prima facie</i> case of total disability, claimant must show that he is unable to return to his usual employment\" because of his injury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>Delay v. Jones Washington Stevedoring Co.,</i> 31 Ben. Rev. Bd. Serv. 197 (1998). \"Once a claimant demonstrates an inability to return to his job because of a work-related injury, he is considered totally disabled within the meaning of [the Act] and the burden shifts to the employer to prove the availability of suitable alternative employment in the claimant's community.\" <i>Palombo v. Director, OWCP,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563798\"><a href=\"/opinion/563798/richard-l-palombo-v-director-office-of-workers-compensation-programs/\"><span class=\"volume\">937</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span>, 71 (2d Cir.1991). In this case, BIW offered no evidence regarding the availability of alternative employment and thus relies only on the argument that Preston did not establish a prima facie case of disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ concluded that the \"record leads inescapably to the conclusion that claimant cannot return to work as a crane operator at the employer's shipyard.\" In making this determination, the ALJ relied on the testimony of Preston's supervisor, who stated that Preston was subjected to name calling and practical jokes, and that his tremors had become so pronounced that other members of his crew questioned whether Preston could safely perform his work. The ALJ also relied on Dr. Kolkin's testimony that Preston needed a \"calm and supporting work environment,\" and noted that the teasing and ridicule that Preston suffered, combined with normal stresses associated with working in a shipyard setting, did not constitute such an environment. Finally, he relied on the opinions of Dr. Carcini and Dr. David G. Standaert, another of Preston's treating physicians, that Preston's aggravated symptoms prevented him from safely performing the tasks required by his employment. He concluded that \"the medical evidence establishes that all of the doctors who have expressed an opinion on [Preston's] ability to operate a crane are in agreement that he cannot safely do so.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This testimony by Preston's supervisor and by several medical experts, along with Preston's own contentions, constitute substantial evidence that Preston cannot perform his usual work at the BIW shipyard. Thus, the ALJ was entitled to find that Preston was totally disabled within the meaning of the Act and was entitled to benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Calculation of Preston's Average Weekly Wage</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The amount of a disabled employee's award of benefits under the Act depends on the average weekly wage that the employee earned while employed. <i>See</i> 33 U.S.C. &#167; 908 (stating formulas for calculating disability benefits based on an employee's average weekly wage). Pursuant to 33 U.S.C. &#167; 910, an ALJ can calculate an employee's average weekly wage in several ways. If a claimant was employed for substantially the whole year prior to the injury, &#167; 910(a) instructs that the average annual earnings should be calculated by determining the average daily wage during the period worked, and multiplying that number by either 260, if the employee was a five-day worker, or 300, if the employee was a six-day worker. That annual figure is then divided by fifty-two to determine the average weekly wage. &#167; 910(d)(1). If, however, an employee has not worked substantially all of the previous year, &#167; 910(b) provides that the average weekly wage should be determined by looking at the wages earned by employees of the same class, in the same or similar employment, and in the same or a neighboring location. Where neither &#167; 910(a) or &#167; 910(b) can be properly applied, &#167; 910(c) requires that the average annual wage used to calculate the average weekly wage \"shall reasonably represent the annual earning capacity of the injured employee.\" Section 910(c) does not provide a precise method for determining an employee's annual earning capacity, but it does state that the ALJ should consider the previous earnings of the employee as well as the earnings of similarly situated employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the record included wage information only for the final thirty-nine weeks of the fifty-two weeks preceding the filing of Preston's complaint, and it showed no earnings for eight of those thirty-nine weeks. Moreover, the record did not indicate whether Preston had been a six-day per week or five-day per week worker. The ALJ reasoned that this partial record was not sufficient to determine Preston's average weekly wage under &#167; 910(a). The ALJ also ruled that the \"paucity of evidence as to the wages earned by a comparable employee\" prevented him from determining Preston's average weekly wage pursuant to &#167; 910(b). Finding that neither &#167; 910(a) nor &#167; 910(b) could be \"reasonably and fairly applied,\" the ALJ calculated the average weekly wage pursuant to &#167; 910(c). <i>See Story v. Navy Exch. Serv. Ctr.,</i> 30 Ben. Rev. Bd. Serv. 225 (1997) (holding that &#167; 910(c) is a catch-all provision to be applied when neither &#167; 910(a) nor &#167; 910(b) can be reasonably and fairly applied).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ calculated Preston's average weekly wage by taking the wages that Preston earned during the thirty-nine weeks accounted for in the wage report ($20,456.35), and dividing that amount by thirty-one weeks (thirty-nine weeks minus the eight weeks for which the wage report indicated no earnings). This calculation led the ALJ to find that Preston's average weekly wage was $659.88. BIW argues that the ALJ should have calculated the average weekly wage pursuant to &#167; 910(a) by dividing Preston's earnings during the previous thirty-nine week period by thirty-nine, thereby including in the calculation the eight weeks in which, according to the wage report, Preston performed no work. BIW's suggested method would have resulted in an average weekly wage of $524.50.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The essential purpose of the average weekly wage determination is to reflect `a claimant's annual earning capacity <i>at the time of the injury.</i>\"' <i>Hall v. Consol. Employment Sys., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"14443\"><a href=\"/opinion/14443/hall-v-consolidated-empl/\"><span class=\"volume\">139</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1025</span></a></span>, 1031 (5th Cir.1998) (citation omitted) (emphasis in original). The ALJ's determination in this respect is subject to the \"substantial evidence\" standard. <i>Id.</i> at 1031-32. In this case, the record contained only partial information about Preston's work history over the previous year, with no indication of whether he worked five days or six days per week. Since these factors are critical to the calculation of an average weekly wage under &#167; 910(a), the ALJ was entitled to find that &#167; 910(a) could not be \"reasonably and fairly applied.\" Moreover, in calculating Preston's average weekly wage under &#167; 910(c), the ALJ accounted for the fact that Preston's condition, aggravated or otherwise, might limit his ability to consistently perform a full work week. The thirty-one weeks used in the ALJ's calculation included a wide range of hours worked, from 4.5 to 51.8, and thus presumably included weeks in which Preston took time off because of his aggravated condition. If anything, the ALJ's calculation likely underestimated the amount that Preston could have earned if he had not been dealing with aggravated symptoms caused by his work environment. Therefore, substantial evidence supported the ALJ's calculation of Preston's average weekly wage pursuant to &#167; 910(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. Medical Benefits</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, BIW argues that the ALJ erred in granting Preston medical benefits pursuant to 33 U.S.C. &#167; 907 because the parties had agreed to litigate the propriety of medical benefits only after litigating whether Preston's injuries were work related. The Board vacated the portion of the ALJ's decision granting any specific medical expenses, ruling that the parties could litigate or reach agreement on the \"reasonable necessity of medical treatment\" at a future date. However, it affirmed the ALJ's general finding that Preston was entitled to medical benefits under &#167; 907.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the Board's decision on this issue. Section 907(a) provides that an \"employer shall furnish such medical ... treatment ... as the nature of the injury ... may require.\" Thus, if a claimant is found to have suffered an \"injury\" as defined under the Act, he is generally entitled to medical benefits pursuant to &#167; 907(a). <i>See Ingalls Shipbuilding, Inc., v. Director, OWCP,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"604843\"><a href=\"/opinion/604843/ingalls-shipbuilding-inc-v-director-office-of-workers-compensation/\"><span class=\"volume\">991</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">163</span></a></span>, 165 (5th Cir.1993) (stating that &#167; 907 \"entitles a claimant to reasonable and necessary medical services if he suffers a work-related injury\"). Our holding does not, however, prevent the parties from further litigating the propriety or reasonableness of any specific medical expense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the Board is AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> 33 U.S.C. &#167; 920 provides in relevant part:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">In any proceeding for the enforcement of a claim for compensation under this Act it shall be presumed, in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary &#8212;</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(a) that the claim comes within the provisions of this chapter.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> \"Substantial evidence\" is \"such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\"<i>Sprague v.

Pursuant to well-established precedent, we decline to address this argument. \"[A]rguments raised in a reply brief are insufficient to preserve a claim on appeal.\"<i>Frazier v.

However, to dispel any notion of unfairness to BIW, we make three points: (1) The Board did not order the ALJ to find that Preston had experienced stress and harassment in the workplace. It simply ordered him to find whether they had occurred. (2) To the extent that the ALJ read the Board's decision as requiring him to find in favor of Preston, he misread the Board's decision. (3) Most importantly, there was substantial evidence in the record to support the ALJ's findings in favor of Preston.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The establishment of a \"disability\" is distinct from the establishment of an \"injury\" covered by the Act, which we discussed<i>supra</i> Part III.A. <i>See Bath Iron Works Corp. v.
