In 1997, Nicholas Delarosa was convicted in\n\nMassachusetts state court of, inter alia, trafficking in over 200\n\ngrams of cocaine.          His possession of some drugs was clearly\n\nestablished, but of importance was whether he had also controlled\n\ndrugs found inside an apartment after his arrest.                            At trial,\n\nOfficer   Joselito    Lozada     of    the    Springfield        Police    Department\n\ntestified   about    the   events      that    had    led   up    to   the    stakeout\n\nresulting in Delarosa's arrest.                Lozada explained that he had\n\nreceived a call from an informant:              \"I received information that\n\nthere was going to be a delivery made at approximately 9 p.m. . .\n\n.   And we knew what apartment [Delarosa] was in.                         He had just\n\nrecently moved from one apartment to another.\"\n\n            Delarosa objected to the testimony on the ground that it\n\nwas hearsay.    The trial court admitted the testimony--not for the\n\ntruth of the matter asserted, but to explain the subsequent actions\n\nof the police officers in their conduct of the stakeout.                     The court\n\ngave an accompanying limiting instruction to the jury, explaining\n\nthat the testimony was \"being offered to explain why people took\n\ncertain actions.     It's not to substitute for your judgment as to\n\nwhat actually happened.\"          This instruction was not a model of\n\nclarity, but the defendant made no request for a more lucid one.\n\n            In this federal habeas action, Delarosa claims that the\n\nintroduction of this testimony violated the Confrontation Clause,\n\nU.S.   Const.   amend.     VI,   and    that    the    trial     court's      limiting\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\finstruction was insufficient to remedy this error.     The district\n\ncourt denied relief and this appeal, based on a certificate of\n\nappealability, followed.    It is unnecessary to concern ourselves\n\nwith the proper degree of deference to be given to the state court\n\nrulings and to the magistrate and district court judges in this\n\ncase, because by any test the writ was properly denied.\n\n          \"The [Confrontation] Clause . . . does not bar the use of\n\ntestimonial statements for purposes other than establishing the\n\ntruth of the matter asserted.\"   Crawford v. Washington, 124 S. Ct.\n\n1354, 1369 n.9 (2004).   Here, the statement was offered to show why\n\nthe officer acted as he did and not for the truth of the statement.\n\nEven if the trial court's instruction was insufficient to make this\n\nlimitation clear to the jury and even if the objection to its\n\nwording was not forfeited for lack of objection, the state's\n\npowerful evidence linking the petitioner to the apartment made any\n\npossible error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n          Specifically, the state provided ample evidence that\n\nDelarosa had control over the drugs in question: he had keys to the\n\napartment; he had paid the rent of the apartment for a number of\n\nmonths; he had been seen going in and out of the building a number\n\nof times over the course of the day, as well as in previous months;\n\nand the cocaine found in his car was of similar quality--and\n\npackaged in the same way--as that found in the apartment.   The few\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fcontested sentences of Officer Lozada's testimony added little, if\n\nanything, to this other information.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -4-\n\f",
