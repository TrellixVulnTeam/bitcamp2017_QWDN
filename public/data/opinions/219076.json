This appeal stems from a dispute involving\n\nthe Paseo Caribe Project in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The controversy\n\nregarding the project concerned whether some of the lands on which\n\nthe project was being built were part of the public domain and had\n\ntherefore been improperly sold to a private party.            Many opposed\n\nthe construction of the project because it obstructed access to the\n\nSan Gerónimo del Boquerón Fort.\n\n           The controversy prompted a legislative investigation and\n\nan opinion from the Puerto Rico Secretary of Justice finding that\n\nthe lands were part of the public domain.1      Op. Sec. Jus. No. 07-\n\n230-B of Dec. 11, 2007.    As will be presently recounted, this was\n\nnot the first opinion to be issued by a Secretary of Justice of the\n\nCommonwealth with respect to this matter. Relying on the Secretary\n\nof Justice's opinion, the Regulations and Permits Administration of\n\nPuerto Rico (\"ARPE,\" for its Spanish acronym) issued a resolution\n\nand order holding all permits for the Paseo Caribe Project in\n\nabeyance and ceasing construction for an initial period of sixty\n\ndays.   The ARPE issued this resolution and order without providing\n\n\n\n1\n    Under Puerto Rico law, the opinions that the Puerto Rico\nSecretary of Justice issues are advisory in nature at the internal\nlevel of the executive agencies. See San Gerónimo Caribe Project,\nInc. v. Regulations & Permits Admin., 2008 TSPR 130, 2008 PR Sup.\nLEXIS 135, at *35 (P.R. July 31, 2008) (certified translation\nprovided by the parties).

(\"San\n\nGerónimo\"), with a meaningful hearing. After successful appeals in\n\nthe Puerto Rico courts, San Gerónimo filed a complaint in the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico under\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 due to the defendants' alleged violation of, inter\n\nalia,   its    procedural   due   process   rights.   San   Gerónimo   also\n\nincluded a Puerto Rico law tort claim under Article 1802 of the\n\nPuerto Rico Civil Code. The district court dismissed the complaint\n\npursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).\n\nWe affirm the dismissal of San Gerónimo's complaint.\n\n                     I.   Facts and Procedural History\n\n              Because the district court dismissed the case pursuant to\n\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), we view the\n\nwell-pleaded facts in the light most favorable to San Gerónimo and\n\ndraw all reasonable inferences in its favor.

The Paseo Caribe Project and the Decisions of the\n                   Puerto Rico Courts\n\n              On January 12, 2000, the Puerto Rico Planning Board2\n\napproved a proposal from San Gerónimo to develop the Paseo Caribe\n\n\n2\n  Among its principal functions, \"[t]he Puerto Rico Planning Board\nissues rules for granting controlled access permits, P.R. Laws Ann.\ntit. 23, §§ 64, 64e, and [the ARPE] administers the Board's\npermitting regulations . . . .\" Watchtower Bible & Tract Soc'y of\nN.Y., Inc. v. Sagardía De Jesús, 634 F.3d 3, 7 n.4 (1st Cir. 2011),\nreh'g denied, 638 F.3d 81 (1st Cir. 2011).\n\n                                     -3-\n\fProject.    The   Paseo      Caribe    Project    is    a    mixed   residential,\n\ncommercial and tourism project located in San Juan, Puerto Rico.\n\nOn July 21, 2000, San Gerónimo purchased two parcels of land from\n\nHilton International of Puerto Rico, Inc. (\"Hilton International\").\n\nShortly before, Hilton International had purchased the two parcels\n\nfrom the Hotel Development Corporation, a subsidiary of the Tourism\n\nCompany of Puerto Rico.\n\n           In   2002,   at    the     request    of    the    Secretary   of   the\n\nDepartment of Natural Resources of Puerto Rico, the Department of\n\nJustice of Puerto Rico issued an opinion (the \"2002 Department of\n\nJustice Opinion\"), Op. Sec. Jus., No. 02-55-B of Oct. 28, 2002,\n\nconcluding that the parcels sold in connection with the Paseo\n\nCaribe Project were not part of the public domain and could be sold\n\nwithout legislative action, despite the fact that the parcels were\n\ngained from the sea.\n\n           The ARPE issued all necessary permits for the development\n\nof the Paseo Caribe Project.           San Gerónimo began construction in\n\nAugust 2002 and by 2007, it had invested over two hundred million\n\ndollars.   As previously alluded to, in 2007, when part of the\n\nproject was nearing completion, the Paseo Caribe Project became the\n\ntarget of negative publicity.          This negative publicity was due to\n\na small but persistent group of concerned citizens who claimed that\n\nthe Paseo Caribe Project obstructed access to the San Gerónimo del\n\nBoquerón Fort.     The group picketed the site and attempted to\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fparalyze construction.    This vocal group of protestors established\n\na significant political constituency and received attention from\n\nthe press.\n\n           The Puerto Rico legislature commenced an investigation\n\nand, in connection therewith, sought the advice of the Secretary of\n\nJustice, Roberto J. Sánchez Ramos, regarding public access to the\n\nSan Gerónimo del Boquerón Fort.         On December 11, 2007, Sánchez\n\nRamos issued an opinion (the \"2007 Department of Justice Opinion\"),\n\nOp. Sec. Jus. No. 07-230-B of Dec. 11, 2007, in which he reversed\n\nthe 2002 Department of Justice Opinion and concluded that San\n\nGerónimo lacked valid title to some of the land on which the Paseo\n\nCaribe Project was being built.         The 2007 Department of Justice\n\nOpinion stated that the land at issue was gained from the sea and\n\ntherefore belonged to the public domain.3        As such, the land could\n\nnot have been sold to a private party without legislative action.\n\nThe 2007 Department of Justice Opinion recommended that state\n\nagencies reevaluate all permits granted in connection with the\n\nPaseo Caribe Project.\n\n           The next day, December 12, 2007, the Governor of Puerto\n\nRico, Aníbal Acevedo Vilá, met with his cabinet.              After this\n\nmeeting,   without   granting   San   Gerónimo   an   opportunity   for   a\n\n\n3\n   The 2007 Department of Justice Opinion acknowledged that the\nSecretary of Justice had no authority to determine the legality of\nSan Gerónimo's title to the property and that this was an issue for\nthe Puerto Rico courts to decide. Op. Sec. Jus. No. 07-230-B of\nDec. 11, 2007, at *180.\n\n                                  -5-\n\fhearing, Acevedo Vilá publicly ordered the pertinent administrative\n\nagencies to suspend all permits for the Paseo Caribe Project and to\n\nfreeze all construction for an initial period of sixty days.\n\n            On December 14, 2007, the administrator of the ARPE,\n\nLuis A. Vélez Roche, invoked Puerto Rico's emergency adjudicatory\n\nprocedure,4 P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, § 2167, and issued an order to\n\nshow cause why the Paseo Caribe Project permits should not be held\n\nin abeyance and the construction suspended for sixty days in\n\naccordance with the 2007 Department of Justice Opinion.    The ARPE\n\nscheduled a hearing for December 20, 2007.\n\n            Prior to the administrative hearing, San Gerónimo sought\n\nto quiet title in the lands at issue.    Therefore, on December 19,\n\n2007, San Gerónimo filed a complaint for declaratory judgment in\n\nthe Puerto Rico Court of First Instance, requesting that the court\n\nenter judgment declaring that the parcels of land at issue are not\n\npart of the public domain and that title lawfully rests with San\n\nGerónimo.\n\n\n\n4\n   Under Puerto Rico law, the ARPE is generally required to follow\nthe ordinary adjudicative process before revoking a permit; this\nprocess requires a hearing that satisfies the requirements listed\nin the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act. P.R. Laws Ann. tit.\n3, §§ 2151(a), 2152, 2157-2159, 2161, 2163-2164. Puerto Rico law\ndoes, however, provide the ARPE with the option of an immediate\naction procedure that allows it to temporarily sidestep the\nordinary adjudicative procedures. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, § 2167.\nEven when an agency appropriately uses the immediate action\nprocedure, the statute provides that it \"shall promptly proceed to\ncomplete any procedure that has been required unless there is\nimminent danger.\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, § 2167(e).\n\n                                 -6-\n\f            San Gerónimo appeared at the December 20, 2007 hearing.\n\nThe ARPE panel consisted of two hearing examiners, one of whom\n\nstated that \"the nature of the hearing [was] not adversarial\" and\n\nthat the purpose of the hearing was for the ARPE to \"gather\n\ninformation . . . so that [the ARPE] may make a determination\n\nregarding the Stay Order of the construction[]\" on the Paseo Caribe\n\nProject.    San Gerónimo presented a motion to dismiss and provided\n\nevidence of its valid title along with a copy of its complaint for\n\ndeclaratory judgment filed with the Puerto Rico Court of First\n\nInstance.    San Gerónimo argued that the Department of Justice and\n\nthe ARPE lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the title over the\n\nproperty.     The ARPE denied the motion to dismiss.           The presiding\n\nofficers stated that the issue of the validity of San Gerónimo's\n\ntitle would not be considered during the hearing.              The presiding\n\nofficer specifically stated that the ARPE's intent was to stop all\n\nconstruction until the issue of San Gerónimo's title was resolved.\n\n            During the hearing, San Gerónimo also claimed that its\n\ndue process rights were being violated and that notice for the\n\nhearing had been insufficient.         The ARPE did not introduce any\n\nevidence against San Gerónimo and did not charge it with any\n\nviolations.      The   2007   Department   of   Justice     Opinion   was   not\n\nintroduced into the record of the hearing.\n\n            On   December      27,   2007,      defendant     Vélez    Roche,\n\nadministrator of the ARPE, issued a resolution and order holding\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fthe permits in abeyance and ceasing construction for a period of\n\nsixty    days, with a proviso that the ARPE could extend that period\n\nif such extension was \"in the public interest.\"                      The ARPE's\n\nresolution did not address San Gerónimo's proprietary interest or\n\nthat of the owners of the completed apartments.\n\n             San Gerónimo appealed the ARPE's order to the Puerto Rico\n\nCourt of Appeals.       On February 6, 2008, the Puerto Rico Court of\n\nAppeals concluded that the ARPE had violated San Gerónimo's due\n\nprocess rights as protected under the Puerto Rico Constitution.\n\nSan Gerónimo Caribe Project, Inc. v. ARPE, case # KLRA2008-00010,\n\n2008    PR   App.   LEXIS   777   (P.R.   Cir.   Feb.   6,   2008)   (certified\n\ntranslation provided by the parties).             The court recognized San\n\nGerónimo's proprietary interest in the permits and its claim of\n\nproprietary interest in the land.            Id. at *52.5      Therefore, the\n\ncourt ordered the ARPE to hold an evidentiary hearing.               Id. at *61.\n\nThe court did not, however, lift the stay on the construction.              See\n\nid.     The ARPE failed to hold the evidentiary hearing that the\n\nPuerto Rico Court of Appeals had ordered.\n\n             On February 8, 2008, the Court of First Instance entered\n\na judgment upholding the validity of San Gerónimo's title to the\n\nland upon which it was building the Paseo Caribe Project.

See App. to Br. of\nAppellant, at 329-89, 394-509, San Gerónimo Caribe Project, Inc. v.\nAcevedo Vilá, No. 09-2566 (1st Cir. argued Oct. 4, 2010).\n\n                                      -8-\n\fGerónimo Caribe Project, Inc. v. E.L.A. de P.R., No. K2AC2007-2577\n\n(Ct. of First Instance, Super. Part of San Juan, filed Feb. 8,\n\n2008).   The judgment held that the 2007 Department of Justice\n\nOpinion lacked legal foundation and that the suspension of San\n\nGerónimo's permits due to doubts about the validity of its title to\n\nthe land was indefensible.\n\n            On February 15, 2008, San Gerónimo filed a petition for\n\ncertiorari in the Puerto Rico Supreme Court requesting review of\n\nthe Court of Appeals' decision that had ordered the ARPE to hold an\n\nevidentiary     hearing   but   failed   to   lift   the   stay   on   the\n\nconstruction.    On February 25, 2008, the ARPE extended the initial\n\nsuspension of San Gerónimo's building permits for an additional\n\nsixty days without holding the evidentiary hearing that the Puerto\n\nRico Court of Appeals had ordered.\n\n            On February 28, 2008, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court\n\nissued a writ of certiorari and granted San Gerónimo's motion for\n\na stay of the ARPE's suspension orders pending the issuance of its\n\ndecision.     Construction resumed.      The Puerto Rico Supreme Court\n\nissued its opinion regarding this matter on July 31, 2008.             San\n\nGerónimo Caribe Project, Inc. v. Regulations & Permits Admin., 2008\n\nTSPR 130, 2008 PR Sup. LEXIS 135 (P.R. July 31, 2008) (certified\n\ntranslation provided by the parties).6         The Puerto Rico Supreme\n\n\n6\n   This decision was not unanimous as it was issued by a vote of\nthree to two. Puerto Rico Supreme Court Justices Fiol Matta and\nAnabelle Rodríguez Rodríguez filed dissenting opinions.\n\n                                   -9-\n\fCourt held that the ARPE violated San Gerónimo's due process rights\n\nunder the Puerto Rico Constitution by deviating from the ordinary\n\nprocedure and failing to hold a meaningful hearing before depriving\n\nSan Gerónimo of its permits.         Id. at *41.        The court recognized\n\nthat,   although    Puerto   Rico     law    provides     for       an   emergency\n\nadjudicatory procedure, id. at *25, the ARPE's justification for\n\ncircumventing     the   ordinary    process    was     \"very    far      from    the\n\nextraordinary     circumstances     that    would    allow    the    use   of    the\n\nimmediate action procedure contemplated in [Puerto Rico's Uniform\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act--the] L.P.A.U.,\" id. at *30 (emphasis\n\nadded).7    The    Court   also    concluded    that    the     ARPE     erred    in\n\nsuspending San Gerónimo's permits based on the 2007 Department of\n\nJustice Opinion as the opinion lacked legal effect and neither the\n\nSecretary of Justice nor the ARPE had authority to decide the issue\n\nof title to the property.         Id. at *41-42.       The Court vacated the\n\nARPE's order suspending the permits and ordered it to suspend all\n\n\n\n\n7\n   The Puerto Rico Supreme Court added that the questions that the\n2007 Department of Justice Opinion raised regarding the ownership\nof the lands at issue \"[did] not present a situation where the\nsummary action of the State is required to avoid imminent damage.\"\nSan Gerónimo Caribe Project, Inc., 2008 TSPR 130 at *30. \"[W]e\ncannot support the thesis by the State to the effect[] that the\nincidents and protests occurred in the mentioned project were\nsufficient to justify the summary intervention by ARPE. . . .\nWithout a doubt, the degree of unrest that the same may have\ngenerated, would not equal the instances where the compliance with\nimminent danger to public health, safety and welfare have been\nacknowledged, or that of an extraordinary situation that would\nrequire the immediate action by the State.\" Id. at *31.\n\n                                     -10-\n\fproceedings to set aside San Gerónimo's permits based on the 2007\n\nDepartment of Justice Opinion.       Id. at *42-43.\n\n           In a separate decision also dated July 31, 2008, the\n\nSupreme Court of Puerto Rico affirmed the judgment of the Court of\n\nFirst Instance declaring that San Gerónimo had valid title to the\n\nland underlying the Paseo Caribe Project.

LEXIS 142 (certified translation of the majority opinion\n\nprovided by the parties).8\n\n           B.   Procedural Posture\n\n           On October 24, 2008, San Gerónimo filed a complaint in\n\nthe United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico\n\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983 due to defendants' alleged violation of its\n\ndue process rights, its substantive due process rights and its\n\nequal   protection   rights,   as   guaranteed   under   the   Fifth   and\n\nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.               San\n\nGerónimo also included a Puerto Rico law tort claim under Article\n\n1802 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code.           The complaint requested\n\ndamages of thirty-eight million dollars due to the seventy-day\n\ndelay in construction that the defendants allegedly caused.\n\n\n\n\n8\n  This decision was by a vote of four to one. Puerto Rico Supreme\nCourt Justice Fiol Matta dissented in part and concurred in part.\nJustice Fiol Matta's dissent was strong and concluded that some of\nthe lands at issue were in fact part of the public domain.\n\n                                    -11-\n\f                 On December 23, 2008, the defendants filed a motion to\n\ndismiss     the     complaint   under      Federal   Rule    of    Civil    Procedure\n\n12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim and under Federal Rule of\n\nCivil Procedure 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction\n\nwith respect to the pendent jurisdiction claims.                      San Gerónimo\n\nfiled its response on February 5, 2009.\n\n                 The motion to dismiss was referred to a magistrate judge,\n\nwho issued a report and recommendation on August 3, 2009.                         The\n\nmagistrate judge advised in favor of the dismissal of the complaint\n\nin   its    entirety,     reasoning,    inter    alia,      that   San     Gerónimo's\n\nprocedural due process claims were barred by the Parratt-Hudson\n\ndoctrine.         See Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517 (1984); Parratt v.\n\nTaylor, 451 U.S. 527 (1981).               On August 10, 2009, San Gerónimo\n\nfiled      its     opposition   to   the    magistrate      judge's      report   and\n\nrecommendation.         On September 30, 2009, the district court issued\n\nan opinion and order adopting in toto the magistrate judge's report\n\nand recommendation, adding that San Gerónimo's claims are also\n\nsubject to dismissal under the doctrine of qualified immunity. The\n\ndistrict court entered judgment in favor of defendants, dismissing\n\nall federal claims with prejudice and dismissing the pendent state\n\nlaw claims without prejudice.\n\n                 On October 28, 2009, San Gerónimo filed a timely notice\n\nof appeal.         We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\f                          II.   Discussion\n\n          A.   Standard of Review\n\n          The district court dismissed San Gerónimo's complaint\n\npursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).\n\nThe district court educed its ruling from different parts of\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b); under either subsection, our\n\nreview of the court's ruling is de novo.     Coggeshall v. Mass. Bd.\n\nof Registration of Psychologists, 604 F.3d 658, 662 (1st Cir.\n\n2010); McCloskey v. Mueller, 446 F.3d 262, 266 (1st Cir. 2006).   We\n\naccept as true the plaintiff's well-pleaded facts and draw all\n\nreasonable inferences in its favor.     McCloskey, 466 F.3d at 266.\n\nWe may affirm a court's dismissal pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1) and\n\n12(b)(6) on \"any basis made apparent from the record.\"      Cook v.\n\nGates, 528 F.3d 42, 48 (1st Cir. 2008); Aguilar v. U.S. Immigration\n\n& Customs Enforcement Div. of the Dep't of Homeland Sec., 510 F.3d\n\n1, 8 (1st Cir. 2007). We review the district court's determination\n\nthat the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity de novo.\n\nMeléndez-García v. Sánchez, 629 F.3d 25, 35 (1st Cir. 2010).\n\n          B.   Procedural Due Process\n\n          A plaintiff seeking to establish a procedural due process\n\nclaim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 must allege that the defendants\n\ndeprived it of a property interest while acting under color of\n\nstate law and without providing constitutionally adequate process.\n\nMaymí v. P.R. Ports Auth., 515 F.3d 20, 29 (1st Cir. 2008).    As a\n\n\n                                -13-\n\fpreliminary matter, the plaintiff must claim the deprivation of a\n\nproperty interest recognized under state law. SFW Arecibo, Ltd. v.\n\nRodríguez, 415 F.3d 135, 139 (1st Cir. 2005).     San Gerónimo has\n\ndone that here.    See San Gerónimo Caribe Project, Inc., 2008 TSPR\n\n130, at *19-20 (holding that San Gerónimo's suspended building\n\npermits constituted a property interest under Puerto Rico law).\n\nBut a further showing is required.       As the Supreme Court has\n\nexplained, \"[i]n procedural due process claims, the deprivation by\n\nstate action of a constitutionally protected interest in 'life,\n\nliberty, or property' is not in itself unconstitutional; what is\n\nunconstitutional is the deprivation of such an interest without due\n\nprocess of law.\"   Zinermon v. Burch, 494 U.S. 113, 125 (1990).\n\n          What constitutes \"due process of law\" depends upon the\n\nfacts of each case.     See id. at 127 (\"Due process . . . is a\n\nflexible concept that varies with the particular situation.\").\n\nTypically, due process requires that an opportunity for a hearing\n\nbe provided prior to the deprivation.   See Cleveland Bd. of Educ.\n\nv. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 542 (1985).      In this appeal, the\n\ndefendants do not dispute that the hearing the ARPE provided prior\n\nto suspension of San Gerónimo's building permits was inadequate to\n\nsatisfy the requirements of due process.9   Although predeprivation\n\n\n9\n   The Puerto Rico Supreme Court held that the predeprivation\nhearing provided by the defendants deviated from the process\nordinarily required under the Puerto Rico Constitution to \"satisfy\nthe minimum demands of due process, as for instance, the\nopportunity of being heard, the right to cross-examine and the\n\n                                -14-\n\fprocess may be the norm, however, \"the necessity of quick action by\n\nthe   State    or   the   impracticality     of   providing   any   meaningful\n\npredeprivation      process\"    may   render      a   postdeprivation   remedy\n\nconstitutionally adequate in some circumstances. Parratt, 451 U.S.\n\nat 539.   The defendants claim that this is such a case, citing the\n\nso-called Parratt-Hudson doctrine.           After close examination of the\n\nmerits of their contention, we disagree.\n\n                     1.    The Parratt-Hudson Doctrine\n\n              The core principle of the Parratt-Hudson doctrine is\n\nsimple to state, though its application in the individual case can\n\nbe elusive.     Parratt-Hudson provides that, where \"a deprivation of\n\na property interest is occasioned by random and unauthorized\n\nconduct by state officials, . . . the due process inquiry is\n\nlimited to the issue of the adequacy of postdeprivation remedies\n\nprovided by the state.\"         Chmielinski v. Massachusetts, 513 F.3d\n\n309, 315 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting O'Neill v. Baker, 210 F.3d 41, 50\n\n(1st Cir. 2000)) (internal quotation mark omitted).             The doctrine\n\ntakes its name from a pair of Supreme Court decisions involving due\n\nprocess claims by inmates against prison officials for the loss of\n\npersonal property -- in one case, property negligently misplaced in\n\nthe internal mail system, and in the other, property intentionally\n\n\nright to examine the evidence filed by the other party.\"        San\nGerónimo Caribe Project, Inc., 2008 TSPR, 130 at *20, *41. Because\ndefendants do not contest the issue, we accept the proposition that\nthe predeprivation procedures did not by themselves satisfy due\nprocess.\n\n                                      -15-\n\fdestroyed by officials during a \"shakedown\" search.           See Hudson,\n\n468 U.S. 517; Parratt, 451 U.S. 527.       In each case, the Court held\n\nthat the availability of state tort-law remedies after the loss was\n\nsufficient to satisfy the Due Process Clause.         Hudson, 468 U.S. at\n\n531-33; Parratt, 451 U.S. at 539-41.         The rationale was one of\n\nimpracticability: where a loss occurs \"as a result of a random and\n\nunauthorized act by a state employee,\" the State \"cannot predict\n\nprecisely when the loss will occur\" and thus it \"is difficult to\n\nconceive of how the State could provide a meaningful hearing before\n\nthe deprivation takes place.\"       Parratt, 451 U.S. at 541.\n\n            We have cautioned that, \"[b]efore invoking the Parratt-\n\nHudson doctrine, . . . courts must give a hard look at allegations\n\nthat conduct is 'random and unauthorized.'\"         Chmielinski, 513 F.3d\n\nat 315.    Where a state official's action takes the form of classic\n\ntort-like behavior, as was the case in both Parratt and Hudson,\n\napplying the concepts of \"random and unauthorized\" conduct poses\n\nlittle difficulty.     That conceptual clarity begins to dissipate,\n\nhowever, in situations where more formal, traditional government\n\naction is at issue -- for example, in the suspension of building\n\npermits.    The Supreme Court has twice attempted to clarify the\n\napplication    and   limits   of   Parratt-Hudson    in   these   sorts   of\n\ncircumstances.\n\n            First, in Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., 455 U.S. 422, 436\n\n(1982), the Court held that the doctrine has no application where\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\fa loss is the result of an \"established state procedure,\" even if\n\ndue in part to negligent official conduct.                  At issue in Logan was\n\nan Illinois law that predicated a claimant's right to pursue an\n\nemployment discrimination claim on a state commission's action on\n\nthe claim (specifically, convening a factfinding conference) within\n\na prescribed time period.            Id. at 424-25.         In Logan, the law had\n\nbarred the plaintiff from pursuing a disability claim due to the\n\nstate commission's inadvertent failure to act on his claim in the\n\nallotted time.        Id. at 426-27.             The defendant argued that the\n\nclaimed   loss    was    of   the    \"same    type    of   essentially    negligent\n\ndeprivation\" at issue in Parratt, and thus state tort remedies\n\nshould be deemed to satisfy due process.                   Id. at 435.    The Court\n\ndisagreed, explaining that \"Parratt was not designed to reach\" the\n\nsituation where \"it is the state system itself that destroys a\n\ncomplainant's property interest, by operation of law, whenever the\n\nCommission fails to convene a timely conference -- whether the\n\nCommission's action is taken through negligence, maliciousness, or\n\notherwise.\"       Id.    at   436;    see    also     Hudson,   468   U.S.    at     532\n\n(\"[P]ostdeprivation remedies do not satisfy due process where a\n\ndeprivation      of   property       is    caused     by    conduct   pursuant        to\n\nestablished state procedure, rather than random and unauthorized\n\naction.\").\n\n            Second, in Zinermon, 494 U.S. at 135, relied on by the\n\nplaintiff     here,     the   Court       addressed    the    situation      where    a\n\n\n                                          -17-\n\fdeprivation of a liberty or property interest occurs under the\n\nauspices of a state law that gives government officials \"broad\n\npower and little guidance . . . .\"           The case involved a due process\n\nclaim by a former psychiatric patient who was admitted for long-\n\nterm inpatient mental health treatment under a \"voluntary\" protocol\n\nwhen   he   clearly   was    not   competent    to    voluntarily     consent   to\n\nadmission.     Id. at 123-24.          Because the rationale underlying\n\nZinermon is both somewhat abstruse and of central importance to\n\nthis appeal, the decision bears more thorough discussion.\n\n                      2.    Zinermon v. Burch\n\n            Zinermon was set against a background of state law\n\naffording hospital staff the discretion to choose from two separate\n\nprotocols for long-term admission for mental health treatment. The\n\nfirst was an involuntary protocol, which granted a patient \"a right\n\nto notice, a judicial hearing, appointed counsel, access to medical\n\nrecords and personnel, and an independent examination.\"                   Id. at\n\n123. The second was a voluntary protocol, applicable only where an\n\nadult patient showing evidence of mental illness gave \"express and\n\ninformed consent\" to admission.               Id.     The defendant hospital\n\nofficials    admitted      the   plaintiff    under   the   latter,    voluntary\n\nprotocol despite the fact that he was heavily medicated and showing\n\nsigns of disorientation, psychosis, hallucinations, and paranoia\n\naround the time he signed the hospital's consent form.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\f            Following his release, the plaintiff filed suit for a\n\nviolation of procedural due process.                  Of particular note, the\n\nplaintiff    expressly     \"disavowed      any    challenge       to    the    statutes\n\nthemselves       and   restricted    his   claim      to   the    contention      that\n\npetitioners'       failure    to     provide      constitutionally             adequate\n\nsafeguards in his case violated his due process rights.\"                        Id. at\n\n117.      Indeed, the Court found that the plaintiff \"apparently\n\nconcede[d] that, if Florida's statutes were strictly complied with,\n\nno deprivation of liberty without due process would occur.\" Id. at\n\n117 n.3.    Sharing the plaintiff's view that the officials' actions\n\ncontravened the procedures required by state law, the district\n\ncourt concluded that the conduct at issue was \"unauthorized\" and\n\ndismissed the suit under Parratt-Hudson.               On appeal, the plurality\n\nof an en banc panel of the 11th Circuit reversed, finding the\n\nParratt-Hudson doctrine inapplicable because the state could have\n\nprovided additional predeprivation remedies.\n\n            The Supreme Court agreed, distinguishing Parratt and\n\nHudson on three bases.            First, it noted that the deprivation of\n\nliberty in Zinermon was not \"unpredictable,\" and that \"[a]ny\n\nerroneous    deprivation     will    occur,      if   at   all,    at    a    specific,\n\npredictable point in the admission process -- when the patient is\n\ngiven admission forms to sign.\"                  Zinermon, 494 U.S. at 136.\n\nSecond,    the    Court   found    that,   unlike     in   Parratt       and   Hudson,\n\nimplementing a predeprivation process was not impossible, as the\n\n\n                                       -19-\n\fstate could have provided additional administrative procedures that\n\nwould have \"limited and guided [the defendants'] powers to admit\n\npatients\" by ensuring that hospital officials correctly chose\n\nbetween the voluntary and involuntary admission protocols.              Id. at\n\n137.   Third, the Court found that the defendants could not rightly\n\ncharacterize their conduct as \"unauthorized\" in the sense that word\n\nwas used in Parratt and Hudson, because \"[t]he State delegated to\n\nthem   the    power   and   authority   to   effect   the   very   deprivation\n\ncomplained of . . . .\"        Id. at 138.     In thus construing the term\n\n\"unauthorized,\" the Zinermon majority expressly rejected the view\n\nthat the Parratt-Hudson doctrine applies \"in every case where a\n\ndeprivation is caused by an unauthorized . . . departure from\n\nestablished practices.\"        Id. at 138 n.20 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).10\n\n             More fundamentally, the Court emphasized that the state\n\n\"chose to delegate to [hospital officials] a broad power to admit\n\npatients to [mental hospitals], i.e., to effect what, in the\n\nabsence of informed consent, is a substantial deprivation of\n\nliberty.\"      Id. at 135.      The Court explained that it might be\n\n\n\n10\n   We note that this understanding of \"unauthorized\" appears to be\nin direct tension with several of our precedents, which can be read\nto suggest that a departure from established state procedures by\nitself renders an official action \"unauthorized\" under Parratt and\nHudson. See, e.g., SFW Arecibo, Ltd., 415 F.3d at 139; PFZ Props.,\nInc. v. Rodríguez, 928 F.2d 28, 31 (1st Cir. 1991). This point\nbecomes critical in our qualified immunity analysis. See infra\nPart II.C.\n\n                                    -20-\n\fconstitutional       to    provide    such     broad     discretion      with       little\n\nguidance on its exercise, but \"when those officials fail to provide\n\nconstitutionally required procedural safeguards to a person whom\n\nthey deprive of liberty, the state officials cannot then escape\n\nliability by invoking Parratt and Hudson.\"                   Id.\n\n                    3.    Application to San Gerónimo's Due Process Claim\n\n             Turning to the facts of this case, we conclude that the\n\nrationale     of    Zinermon    is    squarely       applicable,        and    thus   the\n\npostdeprivation remedies available to San Gerónimo could not be\n\nsufficient to satisfy the Due Process Clause.\n\n             Though presenting the deprivation of a property rather\n\nthan liberty interest, the problem at the heart of this case is the\n\nsame   as   in     Zinermon:   state      officials,      imbued    with      the   broad\n\ndiscretion to effect deprivation of property interests, erroneously\n\nchose to deprive the plaintiff of its property under a protocol\n\nlacking     the    procedural       protections      required      by   due     process.\n\nCommonwealth       law    provided    the    ARPE    with    two   options      for   the\n\nsuspension of San Gerónimo's construction permits: (1) an ordinary\n\nadjudicative        process    involving       a    formal    hearing         and   other\n\nprocedural safeguards, see P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, §§ 2151(a), 2152,\n\n2157-59,     2161,       2163-64,    or     (2)     an   \"Emergency      Adjudicatory\n\nProcedure\", see id. § 2167.                 The latter was available \"in any\n\nsituation in which there is imminent danger to the public health,\n\nsafety and welfare or which requires immediate action by the\n\n\n                                          -21-\n\fagency.\"    P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, § 2167(a).       The ARPE chose this\n\n\"emergency\" procedure, explaining:\n\n            Pursuant to [§ 2167], the agencies may hold\n            emergency   adjudicatory   procedures  of   an\n            expeditious nature when there is an imminent\n            danger to the public health, safety and\n            welfare or which require immediate action by\n            the agency. Some questions have arisen as to\n            the ownership of the land where the Proyecto\n            Paseo Caribe development is located after the\n            Opinion issued by the Secretary of Justice.\n            There have also been several incidents that\n            could affect the safety of the employees\n            working in this project, and of the citizens\n            who have been holding demonstrations near said\n            land.   The conclusion in the aforementioned\n            Opinion that some of the land occupied by the\n            Proyecto Paseo Caribe development is public\n            land, has evidenced the existence of a great\n            public interest in the reevaluation of the\n            endorsements of said project to safeguard the\n            rights of both the proponents and the\n            developers and the resources of the People of\n            Puerto Rico.\n\nIn re San Gerónimo Development, Inc., Order to Show Cause, at *2\n\n(ARPE   Dec.   14,   2007)   (certified   translation   provided   by   the\n\nparties).\n\n            As in Zinermon, there is no question that the defendants\n\nerred in their choice of the Emergency Adjudicatory Procedure. The\n\nPuerto Rico Supreme Court determined that the justification relied\n\nupon in the ARPE's order was \"very far from the extraordinary\n\ncircumstances that would allow the use of the immediate action\n\nprocedure . . . .\"      San Gerónimo Caribe Project, Inc., 2008 TSPR\n\n130, at *30. If Puerto Rico's statutes had been \"strictly complied\n\nwith,\" the ARPE would have followed normal adjudicatory procedures\n\n                                   -22-\n\fand \"no deprivation of [property] without due process would [have]\n\noccur[red].\"    Zinermon, 494 U.S. at 117 n.3.\n\n            Though the defendants may have departed from state law\n\nprotocols in suspending San Gerónimo's permits via the emergency\n\nprocedure, we conclude that their action is distinguishable, on the\n\nthree bases Zinermon cites, from the sort of genuinely \"random and\n\nunauthorized\" conduct subject to Parratt and Hudson.                  First, as in\n\nZinermon, the point at which a deprivation of property would be\n\neffected is perfectly predictable -- it was at the point where an\n\nagency is choosing between regular and emergency procedures.                    See\n\nZinermon, 494 U.S. at 136.           Thus, it cannot be said that the\n\ndeprivation    of     property   without    sufficient       process    was   truly\n\n\"random.\"\n\n            Second,     unlike   Parratt    and    Hudson,     this    was    not   a\n\nsituation     where    \"the   very   nature       of   the    deprivation      made\n\npredeprivation process 'impossible.'\" Id. at 137 (quoting Parratt,\n\n451 U.S. at 541).         To the contrary, it is plain that, as in\n\nZinermon, additional processes could have been implemented to\n\n\"limit[] and guide[]\" the defendants' power to effect deprivations\n\nof property under the emergency adjudicatory procedure.                  Id.    The\n\nemergency procedures statute fails to offer any meaningful guidance\n\non what types of circumstances will justify emergency action,\n\nstating only that such circumstances include \"any situation in\n\nwhich there is imminent danger to the public health, safety and\n\n\n                                     -23-\n\fwelfare or which requires immediate action by the agency.\"                          P.R.\n\nLaws Ann. tit. 3, § 2167(a).             There is thus significant room for\n\nguidance or additional procedures for identifying when emergency\n\nadjudicatory procedures can permissibly be employed.\n\n               Third, with regard to whether the defendants' actions\n\nwere \"authorized,\" it is undisputed that the ARPE purported to act\n\nunder    the    authority    of   §     2167(a),      which   does    indeed     permit\n\ndeprivation of property interests without a hearing in exigent\n\ncircumstances.        Defendants         suggest      that    their    actions      were\n\n\"unauthorized\"      because       they    did    not       follow    the   procedures\n\nordinarily required by Puerto Rico law.                However, Zinermon teaches\n\nthat this sort of \"unauthorized . . . departure from established\n\npractices\" is not \"'unauthorized' in the sense the term is used in\n\nParratt and Hudson.\"        Zinermon, 494 U.S. at 138 & n.20.              Rather, as\n\nin Zinermon, \"[t]he deprivation here is 'unauthorized' only in the\n\nsense that it was not an act sanctioned by state law, but, instead,\n\nwas a deprivation of constitutional rights by an official's abuse\n\nof    his   position.\"      Id.    at    138    (citation      omitted)     (internal\n\nquotation marks and alterations omitted). And, in this case, as in\n\nZinermon, \"[t]he State delegated to [the defendants] the power and\n\nauthority to effect the very deprivation complained of . . . .\"\n\nId.\n\n               In short, this case does not match the mold cast by\n\nParratt     and   Hudson.     This       was    not    a   matter     of   random    and\n\n\n                                         -24-\n\funauthorized action, but instead of predictable overreaching by\n\ngovernment officials given broad discretion to choose the manner by\n\nwhich   property    interests    might       be     deprived.        As     such,\n\npostdeprivation    remedies     were   not        sufficient    to   meet    the\n\nrequirements of due process here.        San Gerónimo has made out a\n\nvalid procedural due process claim.\n\n          C.    Qualified Immunity\n\n          Qualified immunity shields government officials from\n\npersonal liability for damages arising from actions taken while\n\nperforming discretionary functions.      Barton v. Clancy, 632 F.3d 9,\n\n21 (1st Cir. 2011).    It provides \"an immunity from suit and not a\n\nmere defense to liability.\"      Maldonado v. Fontánes, 568 F.3d 263,\n\n268 (1st Cir. 2009). \"Officials are entitled to qualified immunity\n\nunless (1) 'the facts that a plaintiff has alleged or shown make\n\nout a violation of a constitutional right' and (2) 'the right at\n\nissue was \"clearly established\" at the time of their alleged\n\nmisconduct.'\"    Walden v. City of Providence, 596 F.3d 38, 52 (1st\n\nCir. 2010) (brackets omitted) (quoting Pearson v. Callahan, 129 S.\n\nCt. 808, 816 (2009)).\n\n          In this case, we have already held that plaintiffs have\n\nmade out a due process claim, see supra Part II.B., and we assume\n\nhere that they would prevail in proving a constitutional violation.\n\nStill, the second prong of qualified immunity--whether the right at\n\nissue was clearly established--remains to be addressed.                     \"The\n\n\n                                  -25-\n\frelevant, dispositive inquiry in determining whether a right is\n\nclearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable\n\nofficer   that    his    conduct   was    unlawful   in   the    situation      he\n\nconfronted.\"     Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 202 (2001), overruled\n\nin part on other grounds by Pearson, 129 S. Ct. at 818; accord\n\nMeléndez-García, 629 F.3d at 36.            In other words, \"[a] right is\n\nconsidered clearly established if viewed objectively at the time\n\nthe defendant acted, he was on clear notice that what he was doing\n\nwas unconstitutional.\"          Decotiis v. Whittemore, 635 F.3d 22, 37\n\n(1st Cir. 2011) (citations omitted) (quotation marks omitted).                  To\n\ndemonstrate    such     clear   notice,   \"the   plaintiff      must    point    to\n\ncontrolling authority or a body of persuasive authority, existing\n\nat the time of the incident, that can be said to have provided the\n\ndefendant with 'fair warning'\" that his conduct was unlawful.                   Id.\n\n(citing Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603, 617 (1999)).                    Obviously,\n\nnotice is measured by reference to the state of the law at the time\n\ndefendants acted, not with the benefit of hindsight.                   See, e.g.,\n\nWilson, 526 U.S. at 616-18; Decotiis, 635 F.3d at 37-38 (both\n\nanalyzing the state of the law at the time of defendants' actions).\n\n           In this case, we are not persuaded that the state of the\n\nlaw at the time of the incidents put defendants on clear notice\n\nthat their actions violated due process.          Specifically, we explain\n\nabove that not every deviation from state law qualifies as \"random\n\nand unauthorized\" conduct within the meaning of Parratt and Hudson,\n\n\n                                     -26-\n\fsuch that defendants are not required to provide predeprivation\n\nprocess.    See supra at p. 20.          Zinermon makes this conclusion\n\nunmistakably clear.       See 494 U.S. at 138 n.20 (\"Parratt and Hudson\n\n. . . do not stand for the proposition that in every case where a\n\ndeprivation is caused by an unauthorized departure from established\n\npractices, state officials can escape § 1983 liability simply\n\nbecause the State provides tort remedies.\" (ellipsis omitted)\n\n(citations omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted)).             Yet, as\n\nwe have noted (and in fairness to the defendants), a number of our\n\nprevious decisions might have been reasonably read to require this\n\nerroneous interpretation of Parratt and Hudson.             See PFZ Props.,\n\nInc. v. Rodríguez, 928 F.2d 28, 31 (1st Cir. 1991) (\"When a\n\ndeprivation of property results from conduct of state officials\n\nviolative of state law, the Supreme Court has held that failure to\n\nprovide pre-deprivation process does not violate the Due Process\n\nClause.\" (citing Parratt, 451 U.S. at 543)); accord SFW Arecibo,\n\n415 F.3d at 139-40 (quoting PFZ Props., 928 F.2d at 31).               These\n\nstatements easily could have led the defendants to believe that\n\nthey were not required to provide a meaningful predeprivation\n\nhearing    and    that,     under    Parratt       and   Hudson,   providing\n\npostdeprivation remedies was all the process that was due. In view\n\nof this, it cannot fairly be said that the defendants were on clear\n\nnotice    that   their    failure   to   provide    predeprivation   process\n\n\n\n\n                                     -27-\n\fviolated the plaintiff's constitutional rights, and defendants thus\n\nare entitled to qualified immunity.\n\n                            III.     Conclusion\n\n           For the foregoing reasons, although the district court's\n\nholding that the plaintiff has failed to state a procedural due\n\nprocess   claim   was   erroneous,    the   defendants   are   entitled   to\n\nqualified immunity.     Therefore, the judgment of the district court\n\nis affirmed.\n\n           AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -28-\n\f",

This appeal stems from a dispute involving\n\nthe Paseo Caribe Project in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The controversy\n\nregarding the project concerned whether some of the lands on which\n\nthe project was being built were part of the public domain and had\n\ntherefore been improperly sold to a private party.            Many opposed\n\nthe construction of the project because it obstructed access to the\n\nSan Gerónimo del Boquerón Fort.\n\n           The controversy prompted a legislative investigation and\n\nan opinion from the Puerto Rico Secretary of Justice finding that\n\nthe lands were part of the public domain.1      Op. Sec. Jus. No. 07-\n\n230-B of Dec. 11, 2007.    As will be presently recounted, this was\n\nnot the first opinion to be issued by a Secretary of Justice of the\n\nCommonwealth with respect to this matter. Relying on the Secretary\n\nof Justice's opinion, the Regulations and Permits Administration of\n\nPuerto Rico (\"ARPE,\" for its Spanish acronym) issued a resolution\n\nand order holding all permits for the Paseo Caribe Project in\n\nabeyance and ceasing construction for an initial period of sixty\n\ndays.   The ARPE issued this resolution and order without providing\n\n\n\n1\n    Under Puerto Rico law, the opinions that the Puerto Rico\nSecretary of Justice issues are advisory in nature at the internal\nlevel of the executive agencies. See San Gerónimo Caribe Project,\nInc. v. Regulations & Permits Admin., 2008 TSPR 130, 2008 PR Sup.\nLEXIS 135, at *35 (P.R. July 31, 2008) (certified translation\nprovided by the parties).

(\"San\n\nGerónimo\"), with a meaningful hearing. After successful appeals in\n\nthe Puerto Rico courts, San Gerónimo filed a complaint in the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico under\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 due to the defendants' alleged violation of, inter\n\nalia,   its    procedural   due   process   rights.   San   Gerónimo   also\n\nincluded a Puerto Rico law tort claim under Article 1802 of the\n\nPuerto Rico Civil Code. The district court dismissed the complaint\n\npursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).\n\nWe affirm the dismissal of San Gerónimo's complaint.\n\n                     I.

The   Paseo      Caribe    Project    is    a    mixed   residential,\n\ncommercial and tourism project located in San Juan, Puerto Rico.\n\nOn July 21, 2000, San Gerónimo purchased two parcels of land from\n\nHilton International of Puerto Rico, Inc. (\"Hilton International\").\n\nShortly before, Hilton International had purchased the two parcels\n\nfrom the Hotel Development Corporation, a subsidiary of the Tourism\n\nCompany of Puerto Rico.\n\n           In   2002,   at    the     request    of    the    Secretary   of   the\n\nDepartment of Natural Resources of Puerto Rico, the Department of\n\nJustice of Puerto Rico issued an opinion (the \"2002 Department of\n\nJustice Opinion\"), Op. Sec. Jus., No. 02-55-B of Oct. 28, 2002,\n\nconcluding that the parcels sold in connection with the Paseo\n\nCaribe Project were not part of the public domain and could be sold\n\nwithout legislative action, despite the fact that the parcels were\n\ngained from the sea.\n\n           The ARPE issued all necessary permits for the development\n\nof the Paseo Caribe Project.           San Gerónimo began construction in\n\nAugust 2002 and by 2007, it had invested over two hundred million\n\ndollars.   As previously alluded to, in 2007, when part of the\n\nproject was nearing completion, the Paseo Caribe Project became the\n\ntarget of negative publicity.          This negative publicity was due to\n\na small but persistent group of concerned citizens who claimed that\n\nthe Paseo Caribe Project obstructed access to the San Gerónimo del\n\nBoquerón Fort.     The group picketed the site and attempted to\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fparalyze construction.    This vocal group of protestors established\n\na significant political constituency and received attention from\n\nthe press.\n\n           The Puerto Rico legislature commenced an investigation\n\nand, in connection therewith, sought the advice of the Secretary of\n\nJustice, Roberto J. Sánchez Ramos, regarding public access to the\n\nSan Gerónimo del Boquerón Fort.         On December 11, 2007, Sánchez\n\nRamos issued an opinion (the \"2007 Department of Justice Opinion\"),\n\nOp. Sec. Jus. No. 07-230-B of Dec. 11, 2007, in which he reversed\n\nthe 2002 Department of Justice Opinion and concluded that San\n\nGerónimo lacked valid title to some of the land on which the Paseo\n\nCaribe Project was being built.         The 2007 Department of Justice\n\nOpinion stated that the land at issue was gained from the sea and\n\ntherefore belonged to the public domain.3        As such, the land could\n\nnot have been sold to a private party without legislative action.\n\nThe 2007 Department of Justice Opinion recommended that state\n\nagencies reevaluate all permits granted in connection with the\n\nPaseo Caribe Project.\n\n           The next day, December 12, 2007, the Governor of Puerto\n\nRico, Aníbal Acevedo Vilá, met with his cabinet.              After this\n\nmeeting,   without   granting   San   Gerónimo   an   opportunity   for   a\n\n\n3\n   The 2007 Department of Justice Opinion acknowledged that the\nSecretary of Justice had no authority to determine the legality of\nSan Gerónimo's title to the property and that this was an issue for\nthe Puerto Rico courts to decide. Op. Sec. Jus. No. 07-230-B of\nDec. 11, 2007, at *180.\n\n                                  -5-\n\fhearing, Acevedo Vilá publicly ordered the pertinent administrative\n\nagencies to suspend all permits for the Paseo Caribe Project and to\n\nfreeze all construction for an initial period of sixty days.\n\n            On December 14, 2007, the administrator of the ARPE,\n\nLuis A. Vélez Roche, invoked Puerto Rico's emergency adjudicatory\n\nprocedure,4 P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, § 2167, and issued an order to\n\nshow cause why the Paseo Caribe Project permits should not be held\n\nin abeyance and the construction suspended for sixty days in\n\naccordance with the 2007 Department of Justice Opinion.    The ARPE\n\nscheduled a hearing for December 20, 2007.\n\n            Prior to the administrative hearing, San Gerónimo sought\n\nto quiet title in the lands at issue.    Therefore, on December 19,\n\n2007, San Gerónimo filed a complaint for declaratory judgment in\n\nthe Puerto Rico Court of First Instance, requesting that the court\n\nenter judgment declaring that the parcels of land at issue are not\n\npart of the public domain and that title lawfully rests with San\n\nGerónimo.\n\n\n\n4\n   Under Puerto Rico law, the ARPE is generally required to follow\nthe ordinary adjudicative process before revoking a permit; this\nprocess requires a hearing that satisfies the requirements listed\nin the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act. P.R. Laws Ann. tit.\n3, §§ 2151(a), 2152, 2157-2159, 2161, 2163-2164. Puerto Rico law\ndoes, however, provide the ARPE with the option of an immediate\naction procedure that allows it to temporarily sidestep the\nordinary adjudicative procedures. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, § 2167.\nEven when an agency appropriately uses the immediate action\nprocedure, the statute provides that it \"shall promptly proceed to\ncomplete any procedure that has been required unless there is\nimminent danger.\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, § 2167(e).\n\n                                 -6-\n\f            San Gerónimo appeared at the December 20, 2007 hearing.\n\nThe ARPE panel consisted of two hearing examiners, one of whom\n\nstated that \"the nature of the hearing [was] not adversarial\" and\n\nthat the purpose of the hearing was for the ARPE to \"gather\n\ninformation . . . so that [the ARPE] may make a determination\n\nregarding the Stay Order of the construction[]\" on the Paseo Caribe\n\nProject.    San Gerónimo presented a motion to dismiss and provided\n\nevidence of its valid title along with a copy of its complaint for\n\ndeclaratory judgment filed with the Puerto Rico Court of First\n\nInstance.    San Gerónimo argued that the Department of Justice and\n\nthe ARPE lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the title over the\n\nproperty.     The ARPE denied the motion to dismiss.           The presiding\n\nofficers stated that the issue of the validity of San Gerónimo's\n\ntitle would not be considered during the hearing.              The presiding\n\nofficer specifically stated that the ARPE's intent was to stop all\n\nconstruction until the issue of San Gerónimo's title was resolved.\n\n            During the hearing, San Gerónimo also claimed that its\n\ndue process rights were being violated and that notice for the\n\nhearing had been insufficient.         The ARPE did not introduce any\n\nevidence against San Gerónimo and did not charge it with any\n\nviolations.      The   2007   Department   of   Justice     Opinion   was   not\n\nintroduced into the record of the hearing.\n\n            On   December      27,   2007,      defendant     Vélez    Roche,\n\nadministrator of the ARPE, issued a resolution and order holding\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fthe permits in abeyance and ceasing construction for a period of\n\nsixty    days, with a proviso that the ARPE could extend that period\n\nif such extension was \"in the public interest.\"                      The ARPE's\n\nresolution did not address San Gerónimo's proprietary interest or\n\nthat of the owners of the completed apartments.\n\n             San Gerónimo appealed the ARPE's order to the Puerto Rico\n\nCourt of Appeals.       On February 6, 2008, the Puerto Rico Court of\n\nAppeals concluded that the ARPE had violated San Gerónimo's due\n\nprocess rights as protected under the Puerto Rico Constitution.\n\nSan Gerónimo Caribe Project, Inc. v. ARPE, case # KLRA2008-00010,\n\n2008    PR   App.   LEXIS   777   (P.R.   Cir.   Feb.   6,   2008)   (certified\n\ntranslation provided by the parties).             The court recognized San\n\nGerónimo's proprietary interest in the permits and its claim of\n\nproprietary interest in the land.            Id. at *52.5      Therefore, the\n\ncourt ordered the ARPE to hold an evidentiary hearing.               Id. at *61.\n\nThe court did not, however, lift the stay on the construction.              See\n\nid.     The ARPE failed to hold the evidentiary hearing that the\n\nPuerto Rico Court of Appeals had ordered.\n\n             On February 8, 2008, the Court of First Instance entered\n\na judgment upholding the validity of San Gerónimo's title to the\n\nland upon which it was building the Paseo Caribe Project.

The judgment held that the 2007 Department of Justice\n\nOpinion lacked legal foundation and that the suspension of San\n\nGerónimo's permits due to doubts about the validity of its title to\n\nthe land was indefensible.\n\n            On February 15, 2008, San Gerónimo filed a petition for\n\ncertiorari in the Puerto Rico Supreme Court requesting review of\n\nthe Court of Appeals' decision that had ordered the ARPE to hold an\n\nevidentiary     hearing   but   failed   to   lift   the   stay   on   the\n\nconstruction.    On February 25, 2008, the ARPE extended the initial\n\nsuspension of San Gerónimo's building permits for an additional\n\nsixty days without holding the evidentiary hearing that the Puerto\n\nRico Court of Appeals had ordered.\n\n            On February 28, 2008, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court\n\nissued a writ of certiorari and granted San Gerónimo's motion for\n\na stay of the ARPE's suspension orders pending the issuance of its\n\ndecision.     Construction resumed.      The Puerto Rico Supreme Court\n\nissued its opinion regarding this matter on July 31, 2008.             San\n\nGerónimo Caribe Project, Inc. v.

July 31, 2008) (certified\n\ntranslation provided by the parties).6         The Puerto Rico Supreme\n\n\n6\n   This decision was not unanimous as it was issued by a vote of\nthree to two. Puerto Rico Supreme Court Justices Fiol Matta and\nAnabelle Rodríguez Rodríguez filed dissenting opinions.\n\n                                   -9-\n\fCourt held that the ARPE violated San Gerónimo's due process rights\n\nunder the Puerto Rico Constitution by deviating from the ordinary\n\nprocedure and failing to hold a meaningful hearing before depriving\n\nSan Gerónimo of its permits.         Id. at *41.        The court recognized\n\nthat,   although    Puerto   Rico     law    provides     for       an   emergency\n\nadjudicatory procedure, id. at *25, the ARPE's justification for\n\ncircumventing     the   ordinary    process    was     \"very    far      from    the\n\nextraordinary     circumstances     that    would    allow    the    use   of    the\n\nimmediate action procedure contemplated in [Puerto Rico's Uniform\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act--the] L.P.A.U.,\" id. at *30 (emphasis\n\nadded).7    The    Court   also    concluded    that    the     ARPE     erred    in\n\nsuspending San Gerónimo's permits based on the 2007 Department of\n\nJustice Opinion as the opinion lacked legal effect and neither the\n\nSecretary of Justice nor the ARPE had authority to decide the issue\n\nof title to the property.         Id. at *41-42.       The Court vacated the\n\nARPE's order suspending the permits and ordered it to suspend all\n\n\n\n\n7\n   The Puerto Rico Supreme Court added that the questions that the\n2007 Department of Justice Opinion raised regarding the ownership\nof the lands at issue \"[did] not present a situation where the\nsummary action of the State is required to avoid imminent damage.\"\nSan Gerónimo Caribe Project, Inc., 2008 TSPR 130 at *30. \"[W]e\ncannot support the thesis by the State to the effect[] that the\nincidents and protests occurred in the mentioned project were\nsufficient to justify the summary intervention by ARPE. . . .\nWithout a doubt, the degree of unrest that the same may have\ngenerated, would not equal the instances where the compliance with\nimminent danger to public health, safety and welfare have been\nacknowledged, or that of an extraordinary situation that would\nrequire the immediate action by the State.\" Id. at *31.\n\n                                     -10-\n\fproceedings to set aside San Gerónimo's permits based on the 2007\n\nDepartment of Justice Opinion.

Procedural Posture\n\n           On October 24, 2008, San Gerónimo filed a complaint in\n\nthe United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico\n\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983 due to defendants' alleged violation of its\n\ndue process rights, its substantive due process rights and its\n\nequal   protection   rights,   as   guaranteed   under   the   Fifth   and\n\nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.               San\n\nGerónimo also included a Puerto Rico law tort claim under Article\n\n1802 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code.           The complaint requested\n\ndamages of thirty-eight million dollars due to the seventy-day\n\ndelay in construction that the defendants allegedly caused.\n\n\n\n\n8\n  This decision was by a vote of four to one. Puerto Rico Supreme\nCourt Justice Fiol Matta dissented in part and concurred in part.\nJustice Fiol Matta's dissent was strong and concluded that some of\nthe lands at issue were in fact part of the public domain.\n\n                                    -11-\n\f                 On December 23, 2008, the defendants filed a motion to\n\ndismiss     the     complaint   under      Federal   Rule    of    Civil    Procedure\n\n12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim and under Federal Rule of\n\nCivil Procedure 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction\n\nwith respect to the pendent jurisdiction claims.                      San Gerónimo\n\nfiled its response on February 5, 2009.\n\n                 The motion to dismiss was referred to a magistrate judge,\n\nwho issued a report and recommendation on August 3, 2009.                         The\n\nmagistrate judge advised in favor of the dismissal of the complaint\n\nin   its    entirety,     reasoning,    inter    alia,      that   San     Gerónimo's\n\nprocedural due process claims were barred by the Parratt-Hudson\n\ndoctrine.

See San Gerónimo Caribe Project, Inc., 2008 TSPR\n\n130, at *19-20 (holding that San Gerónimo's suspended building\n\npermits constituted a property interest under Puerto Rico law).\n\nBut a further showing is required.       As the Supreme Court has\n\nexplained, \"[i]n procedural due process claims, the deprivation by\n\nstate action of a constitutionally protected interest in 'life,\n\nliberty, or property' is not in itself unconstitutional; what is\n\nunconstitutional is the deprivation of such an interest without due\n\nprocess of law.\"   Zinermon v.

See id. at 127 (\"Due process . . . is a\n\nflexible concept that varies with the particular situation.\").\n\nTypically, due process requires that an opportunity for a hearing\n\nbe provided prior to the deprivation.

In this appeal, the\n\ndefendants do not dispute that the hearing the ARPE provided prior\n\nto suspension of San Gerónimo's building permits was inadequate to\n\nsatisfy the requirements of due process.9   Although predeprivation\n\n\n9\n   The Puerto Rico Supreme Court held that the predeprivation\nhearing provided by the defendants deviated from the process\nordinarily required under the Puerto Rico Constitution to \"satisfy\nthe minimum demands of due process, as for instance, the\nopportunity of being heard, the right to cross-examine and the\n\n                                -14-\n\fprocess may be the norm, however, \"the necessity of quick action by\n\nthe   State    or   the   impracticality     of   providing   any   meaningful\n\npredeprivation      process\"    may   render      a   postdeprivation   remedy\n\nconstitutionally adequate in some circumstances. Parratt, 451 U.S.\n\nat 539.   The defendants claim that this is such a case, citing the\n\nso-called Parratt-Hudson doctrine.           After close examination of the\n\nmerits of their contention, we disagree.\n\n                     1.    The Parratt-Hudson Doctrine\n\n              The core principle of the Parratt-Hudson doctrine is\n\nsimple to state, though its application in the individual case can\n\nbe elusive.     Parratt-Hudson provides that, where \"a deprivation of\n\na property interest is occasioned by random and unauthorized\n\nconduct by state officials, . . . the due process inquiry is\n\nlimited to the issue of the adequacy of postdeprivation remedies\n\nprovided by the state.\"         Chmielinski v.

In each case, the Court held\n\nthat the availability of state tort-law remedies after the loss was\n\nsufficient to satisfy the Due Process Clause.         Hudson, 468 U.S. at\n\n531-33; Parratt, 451 U.S. at 539-41.         The rationale was one of\n\nimpracticability: where a loss occurs \"as a result of a random and\n\nunauthorized act by a state employee,\" the State \"cannot predict\n\nprecisely when the loss will occur\" and thus it \"is difficult to\n\nconceive of how the State could provide a meaningful hearing before\n\nthe deprivation takes place.\"       Parratt, 451 U.S. at 541.\n\n            We have cautioned that, \"[b]efore invoking the Parratt-\n\nHudson doctrine, . . . courts must give a hard look at allegations\n\nthat conduct is 'random and unauthorized.'\"         Chmielinski, 513 F.3d\n\nat 315.    Where a state official's action takes the form of classic\n\ntort-like behavior, as was the case in both Parratt and Hudson,\n\napplying the concepts of \"random and unauthorized\" conduct poses\n\nlittle difficulty.     That conceptual clarity begins to dissipate,\n\nhowever, in situations where more formal, traditional government\n\naction is at issue -- for example, in the suspension of building\n\npermits.    The Supreme Court has twice attempted to clarify the\n\napplication    and   limits   of   Parratt-Hudson    in   these   sorts   of\n\ncircumstances.\n\n            First, in Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110657\"><a href=\"/opinion/110657/logan-v-zimmerman-brush-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">422</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 436\n\n(1982), the Court held that the doctrine has no application where\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\fa loss is the result of an \"established state procedure,\" even if\n\ndue in part to negligent official conduct.                  At issue in Logan was\n\nan Illinois law that predicated a claimant's right to pursue an\n\nemployment discrimination claim on a state commission's action on\n\nthe claim (specifically, convening a factfinding conference) within\n\na prescribed time period.            Id. at 424-25.         In Logan, the law had\n\nbarred the plaintiff from pursuing a disability claim due to the\n\nstate commission's inadvertent failure to act on his claim in the\n\nallotted time.        Id. at 426-27.             The defendant argued that the\n\nclaimed   loss    was    of   the    \"same    type    of   essentially    negligent\n\ndeprivation\" at issue in Parratt, and thus state tort remedies\n\nshould be deemed to satisfy due process.                   Id. at 435.    The Court\n\ndisagreed, explaining that \"Parratt was not designed to reach\" the\n\nsituation where \"it is the state system itself that destroys a\n\ncomplainant's property interest, by operation of law, whenever the\n\nCommission fails to convene a timely conference -- whether the\n\nCommission's action is taken through negligence, maliciousness, or\n\notherwise.\"       Id.    at   436;    see    also     Hudson,   468   U.S.    at     532\n\n(\"[P]ostdeprivation remedies do not satisfy due process where a\n\ndeprivation      of   property       is    caused     by    conduct   pursuant        to\n\nestablished state procedure, rather than random and unauthorized\n\naction.\").\n\n            Second, in Zinermon, 494 U.S. at 135, relied on by the\n\nplaintiff     here,     the   Court       addressed    the    situation      where    a\n\n\n                                          -17-\n\fdeprivation of a liberty or property interest occurs under the\n\nauspices of a state law that gives government officials \"broad\n\npower and little guidance . . . .\"           The case involved a due process\n\nclaim by a former psychiatric patient who was admitted for long-\n\nterm inpatient mental health treatment under a \"voluntary\" protocol\n\nwhen   he   clearly   was    not   competent    to    voluntarily     consent   to\n\nadmission.     Id. at 123-24.          Because the rationale underlying\n\nZinermon is both somewhat abstruse and of central importance to\n\nthis appeal, the decision bears more thorough discussion.\n\n                      2.    Zinermon v. Burch\n\n            Zinermon was set against a background of state law\n\naffording hospital staff the discretion to choose from two separate\n\nprotocols for long-term admission for mental health treatment. The\n\nfirst was an involuntary protocol, which granted a patient \"a right\n\nto notice, a judicial hearing, appointed counsel, access to medical\n\nrecords and personnel, and an independent examination.\"                   Id. at\n\n123. The second was a voluntary protocol, applicable only where an\n\nadult patient showing evidence of mental illness gave \"express and\n\ninformed consent\" to admission.               Id.     The defendant hospital\n\nofficials    admitted      the   plaintiff    under   the   latter,    voluntary\n\nprotocol despite the fact that he was heavily medicated and showing\n\nsigns of disorientation, psychosis, hallucinations, and paranoia\n\naround the time he signed the hospital's consent form.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\f            Following his release, the plaintiff filed suit for a\n\nviolation of procedural due process.                  Of particular note, the\n\nplaintiff    expressly     \"disavowed      any    challenge       to    the    statutes\n\nthemselves       and   restricted    his   claim      to   the    contention      that\n\npetitioners'       failure    to     provide      constitutionally             adequate\n\nsafeguards in his case violated his due process rights.\"                        Id. at\n\n117.      Indeed, the Court found that the plaintiff \"apparently\n\nconcede[d] that, if Florida's statutes were strictly complied with,\n\nno deprivation of liberty without due process would occur.\" Id. at\n\n117 n.3.    Sharing the plaintiff's view that the officials' actions\n\ncontravened the procedures required by state law, the district\n\ncourt concluded that the conduct at issue was \"unauthorized\" and\n\ndismissed the suit under Parratt-Hudson.               On appeal, the plurality\n\nof an en banc panel of the 11th Circuit reversed, finding the\n\nParratt-Hudson doctrine inapplicable because the state could have\n\nprovided additional predeprivation remedies.\n\n            The Supreme Court agreed, distinguishing Parratt and\n\nHudson on three bases.            First, it noted that the deprivation of\n\nliberty in Zinermon was not \"unpredictable,\" and that \"[a]ny\n\nerroneous    deprivation     will    occur,      if   at   all,    at    a    specific,\n\npredictable point in the admission process -- when the patient is\n\ngiven admission forms to sign.\"                  Zinermon, 494 U.S. at 136.\n\nSecond,    the    Court   found    that,   unlike     in   Parratt       and   Hudson,\n\nimplementing a predeprivation process was not impossible, as the\n\n\n                                       -19-\n\fstate could have provided additional administrative procedures that\n\nwould have \"limited and guided [the defendants'] powers to admit\n\npatients\" by ensuring that hospital officials correctly chose\n\nbetween the voluntary and involuntary admission protocols.              Id. at\n\n137.   Third, the Court found that the defendants could not rightly\n\ncharacterize their conduct as \"unauthorized\" in the sense that word\n\nwas used in Parratt and Hudson, because \"[t]he State delegated to\n\nthem   the    power   and   authority   to   effect   the   very   deprivation\n\ncomplained of . . . .\"        Id. at 138.     In thus construing the term\n\n\"unauthorized,\" the Zinermon majority expressly rejected the view\n\nthat the Parratt-Hudson doctrine applies \"in every case where a\n\ndeprivation is caused by an unauthorized . . . departure from\n\nestablished practices.\"        Id. at 138 n.20 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).10\n\n             More fundamentally, the Court emphasized that the state\n\n\"chose to delegate to [hospital officials] a broad power to admit\n\npatients to [mental hospitals], i.e., to effect what, in the\n\nabsence of informed consent, is a substantial deprivation of\n\nliberty.\"      Id. at 135.      The Court explained that it might be\n\n\n\n10\n   We note that this understanding of \"unauthorized\" appears to be\nin direct tension with several of our precedents, which can be read\nto suggest that a departure from established state procedures by\nitself renders an official action \"unauthorized\" under Parratt and\nHudson. See, e.g., SFW Arecibo, Ltd., 415 F.3d at 139; PFZ Props.,\nInc. v. Rodríguez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"557363\"><a href=\"/opinion/557363/pfz-properties-inc-v-rene-alberto-rodriguez-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">928</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 31 (1st Cir. 1991). This point\nbecomes critical in our qualified immunity analysis. See infra\nPart II.C.\n\n                                    -20-\n\fconstitutional       to    provide    such     broad     discretion      with       little\n\nguidance on its exercise, but \"when those officials fail to provide\n\nconstitutionally required procedural safeguards to a person whom\n\nthey deprive of liberty, the state officials cannot then escape\n\nliability by invoking Parratt and Hudson.\"                   Id.\n\n                    3.    Application to San Gerónimo's Due Process Claim\n\n             Turning to the facts of this case, we conclude that the\n\nrationale     of    Zinermon    is    squarely       applicable,        and    thus   the\n\npostdeprivation remedies available to San Gerónimo could not be\n\nsufficient to satisfy the Due Process Clause.\n\n             Though presenting the deprivation of a property rather\n\nthan liberty interest, the problem at the heart of this case is the\n\nsame   as   in     Zinermon:   state      officials,      imbued    with      the   broad\n\ndiscretion to effect deprivation of property interests, erroneously\n\nchose to deprive the plaintiff of its property under a protocol\n\nlacking     the    procedural       protections      required      by   due     process.\n\nCommonwealth       law    provided    the    ARPE    with    two   options      for   the\n\nsuspension of San Gerónimo's construction permits: (1) an ordinary\n\nadjudicative        process    involving       a    formal    hearing         and   other\n\nprocedural safeguards, see P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, §§ 2151(a), 2152,\n\n2157-59,     2161,       2163-64,    or     (2)     an   \"Emergency      Adjudicatory\n\nProcedure\", see id. § 2167.                 The latter was available \"in any\n\nsituation in which there is imminent danger to the public health,\n\nsafety and welfare or which requires immediate action by the\n\n\n                                          -21-\n\fagency.\"    P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, § 2167(a).       The ARPE chose this\n\n\"emergency\" procedure, explaining:\n\n            Pursuant to [§ 2167], the agencies may hold\n            emergency   adjudicatory   procedures  of   an\n            expeditious nature when there is an imminent\n            danger to the public health, safety and\n            welfare or which require immediate action by\n            the agency. Some questions have arisen as to\n            the ownership of the land where the Proyecto\n            Paseo Caribe development is located after the\n            Opinion issued by the Secretary of Justice.\n            There have also been several incidents that\n            could affect the safety of the employees\n            working in this project, and of the citizens\n            who have been holding demonstrations near said\n            land.   The conclusion in the aforementioned\n            Opinion that some of the land occupied by the\n            Proyecto Paseo Caribe development is public\n            land, has evidenced the existence of a great\n            public interest in the reevaluation of the\n            endorsements of said project to safeguard the\n            rights of both the proponents and the\n            developers and the resources of the People of\n            Puerto Rico.\n\nIn re San Gerónimo Development, Inc., Order to Show Cause, at *2\n\n(ARPE   Dec.   14,   2007)   (certified   translation   provided   by   the\n\nparties).\n\n            As in Zinermon, there is no question that the defendants\n\nerred in their choice of the Emergency Adjudicatory Procedure. The\n\nPuerto Rico Supreme Court determined that the justification relied\n\nupon in the ARPE's order was \"very far from the extraordinary\n\ncircumstances that would allow the use of the immediate action\n\nprocedure . . . .\"      San Gerónimo Caribe Project, Inc., 2008 TSPR\n\n130, at *30. If Puerto Rico's statutes had been \"strictly complied\n\nwith,\" the ARPE would have followed normal adjudicatory procedures\n\n                                   -22-\n\fand \"no deprivation of [property] without due process would [have]\n\noccur[red].\"    Zinermon, 494 U.S. at 117 n.3.\n\n            Though the defendants may have departed from state law\n\nprotocols in suspending San Gerónimo's permits via the emergency\n\nprocedure, we conclude that their action is distinguishable, on the\n\nthree bases Zinermon cites, from the sort of genuinely \"random and\n\nunauthorized\" conduct subject to Parratt and Hudson.                  First, as in\n\nZinermon, the point at which a deprivation of property would be\n\neffected is perfectly predictable -- it was at the point where an\n\nagency is choosing between regular and emergency procedures.                    See\n\nZinermon, 494 U.S. at 136.           Thus, it cannot be said that the\n\ndeprivation    of     property   without    sufficient       process    was   truly\n\n\"random.\"\n\n            Second,     unlike   Parratt    and    Hudson,     this    was    not   a\n\nsituation     where    \"the   very   nature       of   the    deprivation      made\n\npredeprivation process 'impossible.'\" Id. at 137 (quoting Parratt,\n\n451 U.S. at 541).         To the contrary, it is plain that, as in\n\nZinermon, additional processes could have been implemented to\n\n\"limit[] and guide[]\" the defendants' power to effect deprivations\n\nof property under the emergency adjudicatory procedure.                  Id.    The\n\nemergency procedures statute fails to offer any meaningful guidance\n\non what types of circumstances will justify emergency action,\n\nstating only that such circumstances include \"any situation in\n\nwhich there is imminent danger to the public health, safety and\n\n\n                                     -23-\n\fwelfare or which requires immediate action by the agency.\"                          P.R.\n\nLaws Ann. tit. 3, § 2167(a).             There is thus significant room for\n\nguidance or additional procedures for identifying when emergency\n\nadjudicatory procedures can permissibly be employed.\n\n               Third, with regard to whether the defendants' actions\n\nwere \"authorized,\" it is undisputed that the ARPE purported to act\n\nunder    the    authority    of   §     2167(a),      which   does    indeed     permit\n\ndeprivation of property interests without a hearing in exigent\n\ncircumstances.        Defendants         suggest      that    their    actions      were\n\n\"unauthorized\"      because       they    did    not       follow    the   procedures\n\nordinarily required by Puerto Rico law.                However, Zinermon teaches\n\nthat this sort of \"unauthorized . . . departure from established\n\npractices\" is not \"'unauthorized' in the sense the term is used in\n\nParratt and Hudson.\"        Zinermon, 494 U.S. at 138 & n.20.              Rather, as\n\nin Zinermon, \"[t]he deprivation here is 'unauthorized' only in the\n\nsense that it was not an act sanctioned by state law, but, instead,\n\nwas a deprivation of constitutional rights by an official's abuse\n\nof    his   position.\"      Id.    at    138    (citation      omitted)     (internal\n\nquotation marks and alterations omitted). And, in this case, as in\n\nZinermon, \"[t]he State delegated to [the defendants] the power and\n\nauthority to effect the very deprivation complained of . . . .\"\n\nId.\n\n               In short, this case does not match the mold cast by\n\nParratt     and   Hudson.     This       was    not    a   matter     of   random    and\n\n\n                                         -24-\n\funauthorized action, but instead of predictable overreaching by\n\ngovernment officials given broad discretion to choose the manner by\n\nwhich   property    interests    might       be     deprived.        As     such,\n\npostdeprivation    remedies     were   not        sufficient    to   meet    the\n\nrequirements of due process here.        San Gerónimo has made out a\n\nvalid procedural due process claim.\n\n          C.

Id.\n\n(citing Wilson v. Layne, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118289\"><a href=\"/opinion/118289/wilson-v-layne/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">603</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 617 (1999)).                    Obviously,\n\nnotice is measured by reference to the state of the law at the time\n\ndefendants acted, not with the benefit of hindsight.                   See, e.g.,\n\nWilson, 526 U.S. at 616-18; Decotiis, 635 F.3d at 37-38 (both\n\nanalyzing the state of the law at the time of defendants' actions).\n\n           In this case, we are not persuaded that the state of the\n\nlaw at the time of the incidents put defendants on clear notice\n\nthat their actions violated due process.          Specifically, we explain\n\nabove that not every deviation from state law qualifies as \"random\n\nand unauthorized\" conduct within the meaning of Parratt and Hudson,\n\n\n                                     -26-\n\fsuch that defendants are not required to provide predeprivation\n\nprocess.    See supra at p. 20.          Zinermon makes this conclusion\n\nunmistakably clear.       See 494 U.S. at 138 n.20 (\"Parratt and Hudson\n\n. . . do not stand for the proposition that in every case where a\n\ndeprivation is caused by an unauthorized departure from established\n\npractices, state officials can escape § 1983 liability simply\n\nbecause the State provides tort remedies.\" (ellipsis omitted)\n\n(citations omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted)).             Yet, as\n\nwe have noted (and in fairness to the defendants), a number of our\n\nprevious decisions might have been reasonably read to require this\n\nerroneous interpretation of Parratt and Hudson.             See PFZ Props.,\n\nInc. v. Rodríguez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"557363\"><a href=\"/opinion/557363/pfz-properties-inc-v-rene-alberto-rodriguez-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">928</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 31 (1st Cir. 1991) (\"When a\n\ndeprivation of property results from conduct of state officials\n\nviolative of state law, the Supreme Court has held that failure to\n\nprovide pre-deprivation process does not violate the Due Process\n\nClause.\" (citing Parratt, 451 U.S. at 543)); accord SFW Arecibo,\n\n415 F.3d at 139-40 (quoting PFZ Props., 928 F.2d at 31).               These\n\nstatements easily could have led the defendants to believe that\n\nthey were not required to provide a meaningful predeprivation\n\nhearing    and    that,     under    Parratt       and   Hudson,   providing\n\npostdeprivation remedies was all the process that was due.
