Gonzales was sworn in as United States Attorney\nGeneral on February 3, 2005.      We have therefore substituted\nAttorney General Gonzales for his predecessor in office as\nrespondent in this matter. See Fed. R. App. P. 43(c)(2).\n\f            Per Curiam.      In September of 2000, petitioner-appellant\n\nMarlene   Daisy     Guerra      Caballero       (Guerra)   and    her   three   minor\n\nchildren, all Panamanian nationals, were apprehended by immigration\n\nofficials at Miami International Airport when they failed to\n\npresent valid entry documents.             The government instituted removal\n\nproceedings but provisionally released the petitioner and her\n\nfamily, who took up residence in Massachusetts.                         The removal\n\nproceedings were referred there and the petitioner cross-filed for\n\nasylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention\n\nagainst Torture (CAT) on behalf of herself and her children.\n\n            Following a hearing on March 14, 2003, an immigration\n\njudge (IJ) adjudged the petitioner and her children removable and\n\nrejected their applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and\n\nrelief under CAT. The IJ's memorandum decision admonished that any\n\nappeals from the decision were due on or before April 14, 2003.\n\nSee 8 C.F.R. § 1003.38(b) (stating that appeals shall be filed\n\nwithin thirty days after the stating of an IJ's oral decision or\n\nthe mailing of an IJ's written decision).                  The IJ's written order\n\nwas personally served on the petitioner.\n\n            The    petitioner's       attorney,         Desmond    P.   FitzGerald,\n\ncompleted   a     notice   of    appeal     on    the   petitioner's     behalf   and\n\novernighted it, via a delivery service, on Friday, April 11, 2003.\n\nThis notice listed only the petitioner as an appellant, omitting\n\n\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\fany mention of her children.1          The mailing was flawed, however, in\n\na fatal respect:        it was addressed to the immigration court in\n\nBoston rather than to the BIA's offices in Falls Church, Virginia.\n\nSee id. (stating that \"[t]he Notice of Appeal . . . shall be filed\n\ndirectly with the Board of Immigration Appeals\").                   The following\n\nMonday, a clerk at the immigration court received the wayward\n\nmissive and promptly called Attorney FitzGerald to notify him of\n\nthe   error.       By   then,   it   was   too   late:      although     Attorney\n\nFitzGerald's office promptly forwarded a duplicate copy of the\n\nnotice to the BIA, that agency did not receive it until April 16,\n\n2003 — two business days after the regulatory deadline had passed.\n\n            The    petitioner    followed    this   unsuccessful       effort   at\n\nremediation with a motion to enlarge the time to file a brief, in\n\nwhich     she   acknowledged     her    lapse    and     asserted     unspecified\n\nconstitutional rights in an attempt to persuade the BIA to overlook\n\nthat lapse.       The BIA was unconvinced:       in a decision dated August\n\n25, 2003, it cited the expiration of the thirty-day appeal period\n\nas its basis for determining that further briefing would be an\n\nexercise in futility and that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction\n\nover the attempted appeal.           Accordingly, the BIA deemed the IJ's\n\n\n\n      1\n      No notices of appeal were filed on the children's behalf\nuntil almost six months after the due date. On March 24, 2004, the\nBIA rejected the children's appeals as untimely.     In her brief\nbefore this court, the petitioner discusses only the BIA's failure\nto allow her own appeal to proceed; she does not attempt to\nformulate any argument that the children's appeals were timely.\n\n                                       -3-\n\fdecision \"final\" and returned the case to the immigration court.\n\nSee id. § 1003.39.\n\n            Undeterred,    the   petitioner    filed      a   motion   for\n\nreconsideration.     In it, she characterized her attorney's blunder\n\nas a \"technical error[]\" and argued that her good-faith effort to\n\ncomply with the deadline warranted a determination that the notice\n\nof appeal was timely.     The BIA denied the motion on March 24, 2004,\n\nrepeating substantially the same refrain that had been articulated\n\nin   its   earlier   decision.   This    petition   for   judicial   review\n\nfollowed.\n\n            On appeal, the petitioner renews her attack, first made\n\nbelow, on the BIA's determination that her appeal rights were\n\nforfeited.    Because the petitioner failed to seek timely judicial\n\nreview of the BIA's August 25, 2003 ruling, the scope of our review\n\nis necessarily limited to the BIA's denial of her motion to\n\nreconsider.    See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(1) (requiring that petitions\n\nfor judicial review be submitted within thirty days of a final\n\norder of removal); see also Stone v. INS, 514 U.S. 386, 394-95\n\n(1995) (holding that filing a motion for reconsideration does not\n\ntoll the time to petition for review); Zhang v. INS, 348 F.3d 289,\n\n292 (1st Cir. 2003) (similar).\n\n            We review denials of motions to reconsider solely for\n\nabuse of discretion.      Zhang, 348 F.3d at 293; Nascimento v. INS,\n\n274 F.3d 26, 28 (1st Cir. 2001).     \"In the reconsideration context,\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fwe will find an abuse of discretion if the denial was made without\n\na 'rational explanation, inexplicably departed from established\n\npolicies, or rested on an impermissible basis' (such as race).\"\n\nZhang, 348 F.3d at 293 (quoting Nascimento, 274 F.3d at 28).\n\n            Viewed through this prism, the petitioner's argument is\n\nunpersuasive. She devotes her brief to explaining, for what is now\n\nthe third time, why her notice of appeal should be considered\n\ntimely even though the BIA did not receive it by the appointed\n\ndeadline.   The substantive argument is unavailing:   the applicable\n\nregulations are crystal clear as to what constitutes timely filing\n\nof a notice of appeal, and the petitioner's filing does not satisfy\n\nthose criteria.    See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.3(a)(1) (\"An appeal is not\n\nproperly filed unless it is received at the Board, along with all\n\nrequired documents, fees or fee waiver requests, and proof of\n\nservice, within the time specified in the governing sections of\n\nthis chapter.\" (emphasis supplied)); id. § 1003.38(b) (stating that\n\nthe notice \"shall be filed directly with the Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals within 30 calendar days\" of an IJ's decision).      The BIA\n\nitself recognized, more than half a century ago, that it ordinarily\n\nis powerless to ignore this regulatory limitation.2       \"Where an\n\n\n     2\n      Under certain circumstances an immigration court may certify\nan appeal directly to the BIA. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(c), 1003.7.\nSuch a certification may provide the agency with the ability to\nreview an otherwise untimely appeal. See Shamsi v. INS, 998 F.2d\n761, 762 n.2 (9th Cir. 1993); Matter of Iberia Airlines Flight No.\nIB 951, 19 I. & N. Dec. 768, 768-69 (BIA 1988). However, this\nprocedure is entirely discretionary and, in all events, has not\n\n                                 -5-\n\fappeal is not filed timely . . . the Board is without authority or\n\njurisdiction to consider the appeal.\"      Matter of G-Z-, 5 I. & N.\n\nDec. 295, 295 (BIA 1953) (holding that an appeal filed one day late\n\nwas unreviewable); accord Da Cruz v. INS, 4 F.3d 721, 722 (9th Cir.\n\n1993).\n\n          There are, of course, equitable exceptions to this rule\n\n— but they are very few and far between.    For example, courts have\n\ngranted equitable relief when a petitioner has been misled by the\n\nIJ's acts or words into believing that the time for appeal has been\n\nextended or tolled and then reasonably relied on that assurance.\n\nSee, e.g., Hernandez-Rivera v. INS, 630 F.2d 1352, 1355 (9th Cir.\n\n1980).   Nothing remotely resembling such misplaced reliance is\n\nalleged here.   This is a case of late filing, pure and simple, and\n\nthus does not justify an equitable exception.     See Stajic v. INS,\n\n961 F.2d 403, 404-05 (2d Cir. 1992).\n\n          At bottom, the petitioner invites us to classify as\n\nirrational, anomalous, or discriminatory a BIA decision that did no\n\nmore than apply the regulations straightforwardly and in a manner\n\nconsistent with the Board's own precedents.      On this record, it\n\nwould defy logic to accept that invitation.    There is no hint here\n\nthat the BIA misconceived the facts, misinterpreted the law, or\n\nacted arbitrarily.   Accordingly, there is no plausible basis for\n\n\n\n\nbeen invoked here.\n\n                                -6-\n\ffinding an abuse of discretion.    See Wang v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 25,\n\n27 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n          We need go no further.    We hold that the BIA acted within\n\nthe realm of its discretion when it denied the petitioner's motion\n\nfor reconsideration and refused to revivify her expired appeal\n\nrights.\n\n          The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f",

INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"382246\"><a href=\"/opinion/382246/merced-hernandez-rivera-and-carlota-garcia-vasquez-v-immigration-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">630</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1352</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1355 (9th Cir.\n\n1980).   Nothing remotely resembling such misplaced reliance is\n\nalleged here.   This is a case of late filing, pure and simple, and\n\nthus does not justify an equitable exception.     See Stajic v. INS,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"581377\"><a href=\"/opinion/581377/veljko-stajic-also-known-as-william-mocus-v-immigration-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">961</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">403</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 404-05 (2d Cir. 1992).\n\n          At bottom, the petitioner invites us to classify as\n\nirrational, anomalous, or discriminatory a BIA decision that did no\n\nmore than apply the regulations straightforwardly and in a manner\n\nconsistent with the Board's own precedents.      On this record, it\n\nwould defy logic to accept that invitation.    There is no hint here\n\nthat the BIA misconceived the facts, misinterpreted the law, or\n\nacted arbitrarily.   Accordingly, there is no plausible basis for\n\n\n\n\nbeen invoked here.\n\n                                -6-\n\ffinding an abuse of discretion.    See Wang v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200992\"><a href=\"/opinion/200992/wang-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">367</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n27 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n          We need go no further.    We hold that the BIA acted within\n\nthe realm of its discretion when it denied the petitioner's motion\n\nfor reconsideration and refused to revivify her expired appeal\n\nrights.\n\n          The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f</pre>",
